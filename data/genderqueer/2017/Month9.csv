need some inspiration how to deal with my chest. Short, I've bought myself an IPL Hairremover, which comes next week. Several areas, I'm 100% sure I want to get rid of my hair and others I don't.

About my chest I'm confused, it has cup A breasts since puberty and I like them, it's just the thick black hair, which is weird. Even though I feel like a fem-tom-boy (AMAB), honestly, it looks good and it feels good touching. Don't know if I should get rid of the hair completely, keep some spots for that feeling and/or making a symbol or keep it? (In case I'm using a bra, the visible areas gonna be hairfree of course)

So I'm sure this is a very clickbaity title, but the message I'm agonising over is not the most obvious one. I have no societal problem with admitting I'm genderqueer. Many times in my life I wished I could be the other sex(going from the absolutes of the scale by stereotypes). Identify as it or simply incorporate the ideas of that sex into my life, I've enjoyed posting as the other sex online in a variety of circumstances, and honestly, wish that I could go out there into the world and be able to identify as whatever sex I desire whenever it suits my pleasing.

The problem and address to the title are that if I ever did represent myself as another sex, I would never be satisfied with it, I would never feel authentically my true nature due to my physical limitations. There is only so much that science can change, and I know until everything can be changed I am always going to be happier as I am. I know that's very vain and probably counter intuitive or hypocritical on many levels, or maybe just plain weak of me. I'm somewhat of a perfectionist, and until I can perfectly represent myself, I would never be able to admit to myself that I want anything more than the way I am now. 

So I'm in a bit of a fix, on one hand, I feel I'm denying myself simply making myself unhappy by not allowing part of my personality to be exposed, repressing it away.

So I'm definitely trans and proud, no doubt about that. :) But I'm really lost as to whether I'm binary or non-binary, probably because I'm struggling to figure out exactly what it means to be either binary or non-binary.

A little bit about me: I'm AMAB and pre-everything, but when everything's said and done, I definitely want to be perceived as female. No doubt about that. But I don't know what it ""feels like"" to be male, female, or anything else. While I've pretty much always wished that I had been born a girl, I wouldn't necessarily say that I ""feel like a girl."" It's just that I'm incredibly uncomfortable being perceived as and treated like a guy. And while I would be so much happier if I had been assigned female at birth, I'm not sure if I'd be *totally* comfortable with that assignment, either. It's like the difference between a pair of shoes that's five sizes too small versus a pair that's one size too big. One's definitely more comfortable than the other, but that doesn't make it a perfect fit. And maybe I'll ""grow into these new shoes"" after I officially come out to everyone. Or change my wardrobe. Or change my name and/or pronouns. Or start HRT. Maybe it's just a matter of time before I realize that I'm a binary trans woman. But it may also be just a matter of time before I realize that I'm a femme non-binary person. I'm honestly not sure.

I also wonder if I'm hesitating to call myself a trans woman due to some form of internalized gatekeeping. The way I've explain it to some of my friends, calling myself a woman and using she/her pronouns feels a bit like calling myself a dancer; I'm definitely not ""not a dancer"" (because I do love to dance), but I certainly don't have the years of training and experience that seems to be the prerequisite for calling oneself a dancer. And I know that trans people are the gender they say they are and have every right to refer to themselves as such! But while I believe that wholeheartedly when it comes to other trans people, it's a lot harder to accept that truth for myself. (Or maybe I hesitate to call myself a trans woman because I'm not? It's all very confusing.)

So I'm looking to hear about what being non-binary means to the people on this subreddit. Maybe hearing other people's explanations can help me get a little bit closer to figuring myself out. (And if you feel so inclined to analyse what I've said about myself and provide your own opinion as to what my gender may be, please feel free to do so.

I have a skincare routine that I'm pretty confident in, I wear baggy shirts/sweaters and skinny jeans. I like wearing blacks and dark grays. I paint my nails but I'm not big on any other forms of makeup.

I like being boyish, but don't consider myself masculine. If I was AFAB, I would say I'm a tomboy. I'm not really sure what that makes me as someone who is AMAB, but ""tomboy"" has always been how I see myself.

Basically, I'm looking for some tips on things I can do to make myself more androgynous. Any kind of advice is welcome. Fashion, workout, behavior, etc. Literally anything would be useful for me in my current quest of figuring myself out.

2017-09-11 05:07:16,6zddm2,6,9,"So I have an issue that I'm struggling with and could use some input from members of the genderqueer community. I apologize for the length.

I am a woman (although I guess I have questioned whether I should identify as genderqueer in the past because I have a personal pull toward masculinity, but I settled on identifying as a woman with a masculine side) who has predominantly been intimate with straight men. (I'm attracted to AMAB bodies, and that just kind of is what it is.) I've always known that I'm really attracted to fem guys, even more so, ironically, than some of my gay male friends. I wound up in a LTR with a straight guy who was kind of small and slim and not hypermasculine, but recently we opened the relationship for reasons that included a lackluster sex life and flagging attraction. I'm not really into being penetrated and I prefer being the penetrator during sex.

During this open period, I met someone I fell in love with. I was really attracted to him first off because he had a vibe that felt feminine even though he was in other respects a muscular dude with a beard. He was sweet and soft and gentle in his mannerisms and voice and flirted in a way that was unlike any straight man I had ever been with before or after my opening of the relationship I am in. He came out to me as genderqueer on our second date and I wasn't particularly surprised. The way we were intimate was different than any other time I have had sex--I did not have to explain my desire to be penetrative or the top to him, and aspects of the way he reacted or simply was in bed were, without being too explicit, not like heterosexual men I've been with.  It was a kind of intimacy that I realized I had always craved. 

Long story short, we didn't date for very long because I am for unavoidable reasons leaving the country for a period of time that is too long for him to want to commit to being in a LDR. As a result of that relationship, I wound up questioning some fundamental things about my sexuality and what I need in a relationship.

I had a conversation with a bisexual man where he told me that ""queer sex is queer"" and there is some understanding of the fluidity of what are understood as gender ""roles"" in the heterosexual context. Putting aside the issue of love, which I also feel for my ex, I was strongly sexually attracted to his masculine-bodied mixture of femininity and masculinity and ""receptive"" sexuality, which meshed with my own. I am thinking about seeking out partners who are specifically genderqueer (or otherwise gender variant), AMAB and like being with a woman who is penetrative/a top. I've found some threads in this subreddit that do seem to suggest that this might mesh with the desires of some people in this community. I guess I feel like hearing what the experiences with love and finding compatible partners has been for people in this community, or what people think about others who may or may not be genderqueer themselves feeling attracted to the traits of genderqueer people or desiring a queer sexuality that is divorced from expectations created by gender presentation or assigned sex.

Honestly I've been wondering for the past three years if I'm ""just a curious cisgender woman"" or not. I would read stuff like [this](https://everydayfeminism.com/2015/06/things-dont-tell-you-being-transgender/) and cry and cry because he/they expressed my fears so well.

Two supportive friends on the trans spectrum and a counsellor at an LGBT organisation suggested I'd never know if I didn't try.

I almost lost my long term commited relationship when I told my partner I bought a binder. We'd discussed it before and he said it would be a deal breaker.

I wasn't sure what I was hoping for when it arrived and I wore it. I both wanted to feel wearing it would be ""whatever, it's not for me."" as badly as I wanted wearing it to feel ""right"". 

I'm still questioning myself and my feelings. I was so amazed at how I looked with a flat chest. I kept texting one of my two supportive friends ""OMG it's so flat!!!! :D"" She asked for a photo and said I looked SO HAPPY.

I decided that for now, I accept my breasts being like size AA and that my partner wants my body to be female. He's heterosexual, not gay or bisexual, he said. He said I shouldn't try because I'm not tormented with gender identity confusion ""every fucking day"" but only periodically.

I don't think I want a flat chest all the time either.

The main problem is that now,people are telling me that I will regret the fact of having stopped hrt,since the moment I decided to stop it,it's all I hear,you'll regret it,you'll end up taking hormones in a future and those comments make me feel so damn anxious. It's true that (recently) I've thought about what if I had not stopped hrt....the other bad part is that most of the times when I feel anxiety, sadness, loneliness or when I feel the pressure of life like going through tough situations I always think it'd be easier if I were a woman...I always found women to be happier, like they have the freedom to be themselves and be happy. 

I feel a lot of pressure from society about what they want me to be as a man,so if I don't fit in ""men's"" standards I feel like I'd be happier as a woman....men all the time have to be super masculine and women can be the way the want to...

2017-09-27 18:00:46,72u25q,6,1,"Hello everyone! I'm a 25 year old AMAB and pretty much am 100% sure I'm not cisgender at this point; however, for the past year and after 2 counselors, I'm still questioning where on the trans spectrum I may be, and my previous interactions with trans community haven't gone well. After lurking here for about year, I figured I would run it by you fine people and any insight you could provide.

Background: 

Looking back now, there were signs that I was trans even when I was young: primarily being jealous of my sister's Barbies (they got me a Ken doll instead; although I did still love action figures--which are basically the same as dolls) and when we created our own Transmorgifier from Calvin &amp; Hobbes, I used it to make myself Brittany Spears. It wasn't until 5th grade that I actually became interested in women's clothes, after I noticed a girl in our class developed breasts and became fascinated by this: most of my early fantasies involved growing breasts or trading body parts, and that pretty much set the tone for most of my fantasies since. I started crossdressing and looking up trans and women's underwear online; I was caught a few times, and I would deny everything and passing it off as simple curiosity.

However, despite all this, I liked being a boy: hell, I like how I look with my goatee, which I dreamed for years of growing--I didn't like most of the boys in my classes and could relate to girls easier partially because I matured faster, but I never disliked myself for being a boy and I am comfortable being referred to as a man--I'm equally comfortable being called a woman, though if I were honest, I do feel satisfied when people call me a woman, but that may be because I've only just started considering myself a woman and it feels validating.

I have reached the point where I'm comfortable shopping for women clothes and heels (for the most part, and it was weird to see a pair of heels and desire them just because :)) and using female pronouns, and I will admit that once I put on thigh-highs and heels, I felt sexy--but at the same time, I'm okay with either smooth or hairy legs and I like my facial hair and my genitals (even if I think dicks are kind of ugly XD).
Ultimately, I just wind up feeling like a man and woman simultaneously and feel just as comfortable with fake breasts on and off, if that makes sense.

TLDR: basically, given my history, I know I'm trans, but since I like both my male and female selves, I'm not sure if I should consider transitioning or not: my ideal would be to magically be able to switch whenever I wanted, but I'm not sure if it's because being male is what I'm used to or which one I'd want to present as primarily.

I'm a 25 year old AMAB and pretty much am 100% sure I'm not cisgender at this point; however, for the past year and after 2 counselors, I'm still questioning where on the trans spectrum I may be, and my previous interactions with trans community haven't gone well. After lurking here for about year, I figured I would run it by you fine people and any insight you could provide.\n\nBackground: \n\nLooking back now, there were signs that I was trans even when I was young: primarily being jealous of my sister's Barbies (they got me a Ken doll instead; although I did still love action figures--which are basically the same as dolls) and when we created our own Transmorgifier from Calvin &amp; Hobbes, I used it to make myself Brittany Spears. It wasn't until 5th grade that I actually became interested in women's clothes, after I noticed a girl in our class developed breasts and became fascinated by this: most of my early fantasies involved growing breasts or trading body parts, and that pretty much set the tone for most of my fantasies since. I started crossdressing and looking up trans and women's underwear online; I was caught a few times, and I would deny everything and passing it off as simple curiosity.\n\nHowever, despite all this, I liked being a boy: hell, I like how I look with my goatee, which I dreamed for years of growing--I didn't like most of the boys in my classes and could relate to girls easier partially because I matured faster, but I never disliked myself for being a boy and I am comfortable being referred to as a man--I'm equally comfortable being called a woman, though if I were honest, I do feel satisfied when people call me a woman, but that may be because I've only just started considering myself a woman and it feels validating.\n\nI have reached the point where I'm comfortable shopping for women clothes and heels (for the most part, and it was weird to see a pair of heels and desire them just because :)) and using female pronouns, and I will admit that once I put on thigh-highs and heels, I felt sexy--but at the same time, I'm okay with either smooth or hairy legs and I like my facial hair and my genitals (even if I think dicks are kind of ugly XD).\nUltimately, I just wind up feeling like a man and woman simultaneously and feel just as comfortable with fake breasts on and off, if that makes sense.\n\nTLDR: basically, given my history, I know I'm trans, but since I like both my male and female selves, I'm not sure if I should consider transitioning or not: my ideal would be to magically be able to switch whenever I wanted, but I'm not sure if it's because being male is what I'm used to or which one I'd want to present as primarily.\n\nI'm sorry for the length of this post.

2017-09-27 18:05:17,72u3dc,4,49,"I have been exploring my gender for a few years, and while I'm still not totally used to the term, I've started labeling myself ""demi gendered."" For me, this means that I am totally comfortable identifying and expressing as a cis man, but I also drift into a non-binary area a lot of the time. My typical style combines menswear with the masculine side of women's clothes (button-downs; pixie pants; simple/subtle belts and watches…). I get a lot more adventurous for my Instagram (not linked to preserve semi-anonymity for this acct.), and I have even worn a fairly short skirt in public once. I also always have my hand-me-down purple Coach shoulder bag.

**Take encouragement, all who are nervous about expressing themselves in ways that don't fit societal norms:** I have almost never faced negative reactions in public, even in a conservative-leaning city. In fact, that one time I wore a skirt out on the street, I got compliments from a few strangers—and I never shave my beard; I was clearly a man in a skirt.

Despite my overwhelmingly neutral treatment, I am still often self-conscious when walking in public with not-totally-masculine attire. Just a couple weeks ago, I was walking home while presenting entirely masculine except for my purse, which I wear across my shoulder like a messenger bag. I was imagining telling someone about the one time I had faced slight push-back for my gender exploration (a lot of my thoughts take place as kind of practice conversations).

The incident took place in one of our local Dillards stores. The layout has all the men's clothing on one level and all the women's downstairs. I was poking through the skirts and found a few I wanted to try on. I was definitely not going to take the escalator up to find the men's fitting rooms, so I walked toward the ones by the bras and sleepwear.

**PRO TIP: Always act like you belong where you are.** You don't need to have a chip on your shoulder, but never apologize with your body language. I have tried on women's clothes in Target, JCPenney, Ross, Shopko, Nordstrom, every shop in the malls... With the exception of this one time, the changing room staff have never batted an eye. (Actually, JCP often doesn't have anyone staffing the changing rooms, so if you're especially self-conscious, you might try there first)

Anyway, I was walking purposefully toward the dressing area when I heard from behind me a panicked ""Sir? Sir??"" I sighed to myself, but kept my head high as I turned to see a female attendant, middle-aged or maybe a bit older, urgently making her way toward me. ""You can't go in there,"" she said emphatically, but trying to keep her composure, ""Those are the women's rooms.""

I can understand protecting women's privacy and safety, but it's worth noting here that the rooms were not stalls divided by bathroom-like partitions with big gaps at the bottom; nor did they have curtains, like at H&amp;amp;M (whose dressing rooms are co-ed, incidentally). Dillards is a semi-fancy outlet, and their dressing rooms have full doors with locks.

I told the woman that I just wanted to try on a few things and showed her my skirts. She was obviously taken aback, and called over another employee—a supervisor, I think—for advice. She explained the situation half under her breath to her superior, ""He wants to try on some… skirts.""

The other woman, younger, but with the self possession of a manager, was totally unfazed. ""That's alright. He can do that."" So I did. The attendant was still flustered and confused, but just kind of shuffled off to reorganize a rack somewhere. It was a very tame experience (for me; that lady was shaken by it, I guess) and it goes to show that if you project calm, shopkeepers are rarely going to give you much grief; they're professionals. That was the ""half"" time I was harassed.

I was thinking about all of that, and how lucky I have been, as I walked on the sidewalk. I always feel in the back of my mind that there's another shoe that's waiting to drop, and somebody's going to call me out or accost me. There's also a feeling like I don't deserve to be part of the queer community because I have lived my life with all of the straight-cis-male privilege (I'm actually ostensibly pan, but that's another conversation) and have never been made to feel unsafe or unwelcome because of my identity. 

Just as I stepped onto the grass to walk around to the front of the house, a car drove by behind me and I heard someone yell ""Fucking f****t!"" and I thought ""There it is. I can check that off."" They kept driving, and I kept walking.

I haven't had a chance since then to dress femme in public, but my hope is that the pressure is less now. Sometimes a negative experience can validate all the other, positive experiences. There are far too many instances, nationwide, of people being beaten or killed for their identities, and I will fully admit that I have grown up with immense social privilege (even ignoring the somewhat controversial idea of ""passing privilege"").

So I've been dealing with this for a while. A big part of why the genderqueer/genderfluid/non-binary labels are comfortable for me is that my dysphoria tends to fluctuate and is rarely extremely severe. I've never had a firm conviction that I'm a man, and even at my worst, I can live with my body.

Over the years, I feel like I've come to accept my body a little more on an objective level. I'm pretty pleased with how it looks. If I look at myself in the mirror, I'll think that my curves look good. From certain angles, my breasts look nice.

But the thing is, even in the best times, I feel kind of distanced from my body. It's like I'm a girl who's gone into puberty over the summer and still hasn't gotten used to it or, well, like I'm a guy in a woman's body. It's ""fine."" I don't hate it. But if I focus on it too much, I become more dysphoric. And sometimes I feel such a longing for a more masculine body. Being attracted to men (I'm bisexual) honestly hurts because I get so jealous of men I think are attractive.

So on the one hand, the idea of starting HRT and/or having top surgery is a little daunting. I don't always feel sure.

On the other hand, I often feel like I'm settling or trying to compensate.

Sometimes I feel like I play up the negatives of transitioning because I find it daunting. Sometimes I feel like I ""should"" be able to be happy with my body and assigned gender, or that I should be able to choose to do this. I actually took a break from Reddit and watching trans-related YouTube videos because hearing people describe trying to bury their feelings but ultimately accepting that they needed to transition was hitting a little close to home and I didn't want to admit it.

2017-09-28 17:26:11,731mgj,5,6,"Sorry for yet another poorly structured post asking about gender.. I could really use some help though. (I've been through hundreds of similar posts, and haven't come across any that seem like me. I also tried r/nonbinary without luck.)

I'd like to start talking to a therapist. My dysphoria in the last month has been far worse than it ever has before - so much so that I don't think I can just ignore it anymore. I'm trying to find one with nonbinary awareness, but I don't even know if I am NB... I'm really scared to talk to someone who isn't going to understand or be able to help.

I'm AMAB, but definitely not male. As far as I can tell, I identify as a girl-child. This doesn't really even make sense to me, since I would think that girl-child and boy-child would be the same, but I definitely only ever think girl, not boy. 

Random thoughts:

* My ideal self has no secondary sex characteristics.

* In my dreams and fantasies I'm usually a child (usually feminine - almost always dresses and long hair). Not in school or anything, just the body of a child and normal dream/fantasy stuff (including mundane everyday life). 

* My main sources of physical dysphoria are: body hair, facial structure and shoulders. 

* I'm tall for a male, and while I worry that it would make it difficult to pass as a girl, it doesn't actually cause me dysphoria. (That said, I do imagine myself as a child - short.)

* I don't find my penis to be a source of dysphoria. (Though I'm also not really that attached to it - if I were to transition, I would probably get SRS as well.)

* My father has accidentally called me his daughter twice - and it makes me incredibly happy (the second time was earlier this year).

* I'm 31 and don't have any ingrained social fears or anything/have no desire to actually be a child. When the hypothetical ""what would I do if I suddenly woke up as a child"" question comes up, I usually just think of how dreadful it would be. When I consider being a girl though, the question becomes less dreadful and is actually fun to ponder what school/life would be like growing up, but not necessarily a desire to actually go through it.

* I have a strong libido, but I think I would be happier with none/no awareness of sex. (When I think of my ""ideal"" self, I never think about sexual relationships (though I do imagine having a partner to talk to/share life with/cuddle and relax with).)

* I can't imagine the future as a man. 

* I can't imagine the future as a woman.

* The dysphoria changes - some weeks I don't think about it that much and don't have any issues, then other weeks its crippling.

* I really don't want breasts - I could maybe see small ones ('A' cup at the absolute max) as being fun but I'm terrified that I would have larger ones (probably true based on close family) --- this is the main reason that I've never started transitioning.



Would this be considered NB? Agender? Femboy? Just really messed up trans-feminine?

How do I find a therapist that will have any clue on how to help me?

I could really use some help though. (I\'ve been through hundreds of similar posts, and haven\'t come across any that seem like me. I also tried r/nonbinary without luck.)\n\nI\'d like to start talking to a therapist. My dysphoria in the last month has been far worse than it ever has before - so much so that I don\'t think I can just ignore it anymore. I\'m trying to find one with nonbinary awareness, but I don\'t even know if I am NB... I\'m really scared to talk to someone who isn\'t going to understand or be able to help.\n\nI\'m AMAB, but definitely not male. As far as I can tell, I identify as a girl-child. This doesn\'t really even make sense to me, since I would think that girl-child and boy-child would be the same, but I definitely only ever think girl, not boy. \n\nRandom thoughts:\n\n* My ideal self has no secondary sex characteristics.\n\n* In my dreams and fantasies I\'m usually a child (usually feminine - almost always dresses and long hair). Not in school or anything, just the body of a child and normal dream/fantasy stuff (including mundane everyday life). \n\n* My main sources of physical dysphoria are: body hair, facial structure and shoulders. \n\n* I\'m tall for a male, and while I worry that it would make it difficult to pass as a girl, it doesn\'t actually cause me dysphoria. (That said, I do imagine myself as a child - short.)\n\n* I don\'t find my penis to be a source of dysphoria. (Though I\'m also not really that attached to it - if I were to transition, I would probably get SRS as well.)\n\n* My father has accidentally called me his daughter twice - and it makes me incredibly happy (the second time was earlier this year).\n\n* I\'m 31 and don\'t have any ingrained social fears or anything/have no desire to actually be a child.

2017-09-29 14:46:12,73894b,3,5,"Hi guys, 
I am a 24 yr old AFAB genderqueer fellow. I have a top surgery date approaching in about 2 months and I am internally freaking out. I am still under my mother's insurance which has coverage for surgery even though I'm not on T. However, a few months ago I found out her insurance will be changing very soon, and since then I have been scrambling to figure out if I should pursue surgery (an opportunity to have this much coverage may not come around again for years... I am not even sure if I will ever go on T).


 I am feeling really stuck and anxious lately. I keep shifting between feeling certainty/excitement, doubt/anxiety, and then often experiencing apathy towards everything (which is not unusual for me in my daily life). I don't know why this is so hard for me. I think I have an overwhelming fear of regret, and the permanence of it all. I have literally been obsessing about this every day since I found out about the insurance change and have been taking steps since then to get closer to surgery i.e. saw a gender therapist who wrote me a letter after our 3rd meeting, dealing with my insurance a lot, had my consultation with the surgeon, already planned surgery date (December 13th because mother's insurance ends January 1st)



I am feeling very helpless in this situation. I have been binding for 5 years without pause (i wear it all the time, even during sex. Never take it off unless I'm showering or sometimes sleeping-- I know it is unhealthy) so I would think this would be relieving, but it is giving me so much anxiety. I am afraid that I won't be able to deal with the consequences of the surgery and how I might view myself (I have a lot of internalized shame that I think stems from childhood). I am also worried that I will realize I should have just gotten a breast reduction. I am larger chested so sometimes I wonder if I had just been born with a small A cup, if that would've made me happy. This has been my newest obsession, wondering if top surgery is too extreme and I should just have a breast reduction. But I am also terrified of how I might feel if I don't have this surgery and miss that deadline. I envision myself with a smaller chest, and sometimes it seems more relieving but other times it seems not enough. The same thing with a completely flat chest-- sometimes seems relieving and other times I feel like it's maybe too drastic?



Either way, I am afraid of feeling suicidal with the result. Either doing the surgery and somehow regretting it (even though I never use my boobs for anything so that seems irrational... but I guess fear of doing it and feeling like it still isn't me or like there isn't any body that would make me feel fully comfortable. I guess more afraid of how I will view myself and how others will view me and that I might just dissociate more). Or not doing the surgery and then feeling horrible about myself and absolutely stuck until I maybe have a similar opportunity years from now (the thought of missing the opportunity sometimes makes me want to crawl out of my skin).



Sorry for the rant guys, I guess I'm just looking for clarity. I think being genderqueer doesn't necessarily make the decision easier. I am afraid of being perceived as a halfway transition or feeling incomplete (sorry, not meant to offend anyone... these are inward feelings only). Even though I know I don't feel like any gender really, and whatever will make me look most androgynous would probably make me happiest. 



I need to make the best decision for myself, I can deal with the consequences later. I just don't know what the best decision is and I'm beginning to feel pretty hopeless.




If some background is helpful:
-Binding for 5 years (never remove it, only showering and sleep)
-Feel extreme chest dysphoria in intimate settings or will revert to apathy
-Been going by he/him pronouns for over a year
-Came out as genderqueer 5 years ago
-Legally changed my name over 2 years ago
(Essentially have been making a slow progression of transition for the past 5 years)


So, what would you do if you were me? It seems like everyone in my life seems more certain that this would make me happy than I do. I can never seem to move past my doubts...

I've already thought this to death, but if anyone has a perspective or exercise they think might get me closer to clarity, I'd love to hear it.

I've been opting to identify as genderqueer for a few years now, in an attempt to combat the confusion and stress that I feel whenever I try and think about my gender. The trouble is, I feel like I'm battling two different strands whenever I consider it. Whether it's a true transgender, gender dysphoria, or whether I'm perfectly happy the way that I am. I was born female, for context.

As a kid I know I always fantasized about being male. I would play make believe as a man, in gay relationships, with a friend of mine almost constantly. I never pretended to be a fully grown adult woman. As I aged I never really grew out of it, but I grew into womanhood. 

I'm 19 now. I'm not uncomfortable in my body most of the time. My boobs a bit too big for my liking, but in my defense they're fucking huge. And I'm not quite a fan of vaginas - even my own. Despite that I'm not unhappy, I think, as a woman. I dress up sometimes, though I'm not much of a skirt/dress person. I love shirts that show off my cleavage. That sort of thing. That being said I often feel a longing, that I can't quite figure out. I think a part of me has entertained what life would've been like if I'd been born a male, and I often say to myself that I'm not sure I want to transition and become male, but I'd sure have liked to be born male. When it comes to sexual attraction, or sexual fantasy I have a hard time getting turned on by any form of vaginal sex. I often fantasize about gay sex. I'd love a penis, I think it'd be easier in a lot of ways but I just sort of like the idea of having one. 

I've bought a binder in the past, but I mostly use it just to make my boobs less prominent. I've tried going out in public appearing male, as best as I can manage, and I don't neccisarily feel more comfortable or less comfortable than I always do.

2017-09-29 22:14:19,73b600,4,12,"So, I've been pretty comfortable with my gender (assigned female, biologically female) for most of my life. I just thought it was normal for some girls to prefer 'cool' toys to 'girly' toys as a kid. I grew up with four brothers, and I guess you could say that Ninja Turtles and Dragon Ball Z has rubbed off on me. I hated having my hair braided, played with, or styled at all by anyone. But I loved growing it very long, and take great pride in it. I just don't like doing much with it; just brush it, throw it into a bun, boom. Done.

I stopped wearing dresses when I was 6. I dreaded putting on a dress for church on Sunday because I felt girly and weak. I couldn't run in it, I couldn't do cartwheels or climb trees, and it was just vastly impractical and stupid to me. Occasionally, I will try on dresses for special occasions to look 'pretty', or for a cosplay, but this is rare for me. I gave up on makeup when I was 14, valuing my sleep more than hiding my zits. But I loved special effects makeup. It just looks so cool!

It's not that I've been uncomfortable with my body, or taken abnormal pride in it. It's more like I didn't notice it. I simply didn't care. But now, I'm not as sure as I used to be.

I've had people ask me if I'm a lesbian. I've said, 'No, I'm asexual'. I've had people ask me if I'm genderqueer. I used to say no immediately, but now that I've had time to reexamine my behaviors in the past, I'm more unsure.

I know internet quizzes are widely unreliable, but my quiz results have run the gamut from 'cis-female' to 'cis-male' to 'non-binary' to 'bigender'.

Part of me doesn't care, and just wants to say 'You can use 'they/them' or 'she/her' if you really feel like it'. But part of me wants to still identify as cis-female. But part of me still feels more comfortable going out drinking with the guys rather than painting my toenails.

TL;DR: I think I'm non-binary. But I have absolutely no idea. WTF?

2017-09-30 00:56:48,73c1id,8,2,"okay so a liiiiiitle back story.
I am afab and questioning my gender, but I currently feel most comfortable posting in genderqueer because that seems to fit best at the moment.
Anyway, so I noticed a pattern in my life (before questioning) that the guys who liked me, or ones I've dated, were definitely leaning a little more to the feminine side, and honestly I would NOT be surprised if one or more came out as gay (or trans) at some point.

So my current bf is no exception to this (I don't even do this on purpose, I swear.) We haven't talked much about my gender identity but I brought it up today and he said he was open to talking about it and would like to better understand. 

Anyway, most of our friendship, and now, relationship I have identified as a cis-girl. And at one point I had started to question his sexuality (not to his face but I do slide in some questions here and there like ""would you ever ____ with a guy"". and so on). He seems to be somewhat open to the idea and in my opinion has more of an attraction to guys than he may realize. (I only say this because he does comment on men's looks quite a bit)
 I won't go into too much detail, but mostly mannerisms and comments here and there from him have caused me to question his sexuality.
(please note that I know that these things don't define people's sexualities, but trust that I have spent enough time with him and many gay people to have a good ""radar"" if you will for these things) 

sidenote: I frequent the FTM pages on here as well as I'm still figuring what gender suits me best... and I read some stories about pre-out, pre-transition, trans men who dated guys, whom later turned out to be gay. which, makes a lot of sense. 

and here lies my question. Are there any openly genderqueer people who are dating men who identify as gay? does that even work? lol specifically afab people? Although amab would be relevant as well.

2017-09-30 02:23:58,73cgvu,8,34,"Today marks two weeks since I came out to my mom two weeks ago. She took it... okay. Mostly she seemed confused and out of her depth. I may have over-compensated and told her more than she could handle at the time, and I definitely overwhelmed her.

Over the past few weeks, I've been sending her resources, videos, articles, all sorts of things about all things nonbinary. She reads/watches them and responds, and sometimes has questions, but mostly she just comments about them - as in nonbinary people in general, and not me, her child who is nonbinary.

Today she picked me up from school and we had a two hour drive from my college back home. It's usually on those drives that I tell her things. The last time I came home (two weeks ago) I told her I am nonbinary. So we were back in that headspace of me feeling comfortable to talk.

And boy did we talk.

She still doesn't seem to have a huge grasp on... anything lgbtq. We talked about a lot of different things - representation in media, the stereotypes of gay people, the information and community that is on the internet. But when we finally got around to *me,* she seems confused. From what I could gather, she thinks I'm just a confused trans guy? She's heard of exactly one nonbinary person her whole life (she's 50), so she has no context for this. I tried explaining that *I'm not a boy, but I'm not a girl either* but I could see when I glanced over at her that she really doesn't get it, but is trying to be supportive. She drove me to get my hair cut, and doesn't make any noises about the boys clothes I wear. But something she said stuck with me. ""I don't even know what you are.""

It wasn't meant to hurt me. It was just an honest statement. She doesn't get me at all. She's trying, but she's not there. At least, that's the nice way of interpreting that statement.

Since coming out as non-binary about a year ago, I've been working really hard on transitioning my appearance to be more androgynous.  At this point I'm wearing pretty much exclusively ""women's"" clothing (though generally with a more androgynous bent) and earrings, painting my nails, shaving my legs, etc.  Though I'm much more comfortable with my appearance and identity now than I ever was when presenting/identifying as cis male, I still feel a lot of dysphoria about my body, especially with regard to distribution of fat around my abdomen (small hips, slightly larger waist), and feel a lot of frustration with being read pretty much universally as male—ideally, I'd be very hard to read with a slight bias towards being read as female.  I've been thinking about HRT as a possible option, but I've got a lot of hesitations.  First of all, while breast development would not be a problem for me per se, it's not really my goal and I feel like having breasts would just get inconvenient.  Second, I know that going on estrogen can cause significant mood changes, and I'm worried about how I'd handle that as someone who has a bit of a tendency to be overly emotional as it is.  Third, I'm in a serious relationship (coincidentally, with another trans person), and I'm concerned about how the loss of libido could affect our relationship.
