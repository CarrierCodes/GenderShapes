2017-12-02 14:42:48,7h2yp9,3,3,"Hi! I'm born female, and I have a weird history with my gender. You see, I made the mistake of pretending to be a guy with my ex girlfriend simply because I agreed and thought it would be okay. I used to crossplay (cosplay the opposite gender), and i would be the guy and she would be the girl.

She later coerced me into this identity I initially wanted after she constantly forced me to act more ""boyish"" or ""manly"", which turned me off. What confuses me more is whether or not I just consider my being male a fantasy (since i can pass as one, sometimes, used to back in my younger days but not as much at present), or if I really wanted it. 

I used to think that I changed my wardrobe just for her and this whole boyish thing was her influence but about five years from breaking up with her (I have a boyfriend), I find myself wanting to wear men's wear still, and liking it when people call me by male pronouns or terms, or liking it when people say I look like a guy. Problem is, I accept my being female, but when I think deeper, I start to question whether or not I really accept it even if I am given the choice to make the switch. I thought of a male name and a gender neutral name just to make myself feel better, but I do not want to make a decision I will regret. I should not feel ashamed if I suddenly revert back to a feminine identity, I am just simply exploring my identity. i remind myself that I don't need to act a certain way to be considered a man, that this will not make me any more attractive, this will not make me any cooler, this may not make girls notice me for the presumed attractiveness i aim to have (I have had bad luck with girls, as you can see, but it does not mean I am unhappy with my boyfriend. An acknowledgement of my manliness or beauty from a girl/woman would make me happy.)

* What is gender therapy for? 
* Without giving me personal details of course, what sorts of things would a person talk to their gender therapist about?
* Is there an end goal for gender therapy?
* Those who have completed it or no longer attend sessions, do you feel like you understand your relationship with your gender better than before gender therapy?
* Do you think (or have you had experience with) gender therapy could help someone whose family isn't understanding? Ex: Help family understand and solve conflicts concerning the person's gender identity. 
* And finally, this one might seem a bit controversial, but do you think that anyone, even cis people, could benefit from talking about gender with a therapist?

In March this year I accepted that I was some flavor of trans, started on an AA, and felt a whole lot better.  I added E two months later, and that improved my head even more. Finally in June I started on antidepressants, and from there life got pretty good.  

Well, except for the sexual side effects of SSRIs. I hadn't had an orgasm in months, and my psych care team hadn't found the magic combination of meds which could control my anxiety, depression and OCD, while still letting me ""finish.""

So the experiment was to taper off my antiandrogens and estrogen, and let testosterone run things again for a while.

That...  Didn't go so well.  I didn't even get fully tapered-off before it was clear this was a bad idea. Apparently even small amounts of testosterone turns me into a short-tempered asshole. And I couldn't take the body smell. Or the oily skin. Or the faster-growing facial hair. Or the returning sexual urges.

Testosterone is not the hormone for me.  Wifey agrees, fortunately. And that's a relief. I'm glad she got another look at what it does to me, and likes me better without it. Hopefully now she can be more receptive to me presenting less masc in the future.

I'm back on my t-blocker now, and just knowing I am is a huge relief, even before my T is knocked down again.

For some people it is the right sex hormone. Not for me.

TL;DR - Testosterone makes me a dick.

2017-12-10 20:23:07,7iwh5f,20,25,"Hey everyone! I got a question for you.
I'm AMAB and came out something like 2 months ago (only to me, and to my girlfriend) as genderqueer/nonbinary/agender. This was weird, but great. I can finally put some words on what I am, and I am (sometimes) happy with myself.

But.

The problem is I'm not really out, and I can't really express as I want. I still looks like a man, and aside from some sweaters and t-shirts that come from the woman aisle, there is nothing that could tell I'm not cis when you look at me.
I'm not ready (and probably never will) to be out at work and in my small town, and this is why I can't really change the way I look. I have more freedom at home, where I began to express a little more as I want.
This begins to be a problem as I am more and more open on my gender identity when I'm home. When I am outside/at work, it makes me think I'm just a cis-male who is looking for problems he doesn't have. I know expression is really different from gender identity and everything. But still. A lot of people even in the LGBTQ community are saying that genderqueer people are fake, or just liberal bulshit. And in the pro-genderqueer / pro-enby media productions, you always see those cool queer and androgynous looks that makes you think this is the only way you should express your gender as a non binary person.

So, finally, here is my question. Sorry if it sounds dumb:
How can I ""feel"" more androgynous everyday in my gender expression, without being obviously queer to my coworkers and my neighbors?
I already want to upgrade my cool socks collection with a cool tights and stockings collection to wear under my jeans. But aside from that, I can't really see what I could do without being too visible to other people.

I am not so physically dysmorphyic that I need surgery, so I am okay with the status quo.

first real time on reddit, so if i'm asking this in the wrong place or the wrong way sorry

both because it's how i feel most comfortable and because i want to be safe when presenting femininely, i'd like to be able to get a close-enough-to-look-clean shave. however, i'm dyspraxic, so using a manual razor usually means getting nicked fairly often (especially when the blades are new). i used an (secondhand) electric razor for a while and found while it was quicker and easier i couldn't get a level of shave i wanted with it (but even when the blades are new i can't quite get rid of everything on my face with a manual razor either)

if there's any other dyspraxic trans girls/nb people here, do you have any sort of advice (in terms of equipment or technique or anything)? or if you're not dyspraxic but can still help when it comes to the 'i need a can-safely-pass level of smooth-shavenness but don't want nicks' issue, that'd be appreciated too

Now, when I was a teenager, it was no big deal. Tylenol and tampons to the rescue. Whatevs. I still think of it as a mildly inconvenient bodily function and in awe of its significance in the epic power to make a human if I choose not to evict the whole system. 

When I hit about 20, I went to a party, had a beer and a few hits of weed, went to change my tampon and ended up in what felt like convulsions on the bathroom floor. Looking back, I should have gone to the hospital. But after I removed the fresh tampon I started to feel better. After that night, I realized I probably had TSS and couldn't wear tampons anymore. 

In leu of tampons, I went for pads, then cups (11/10 these are the *best*), but when I got an IUD and used a cup, I ended up accidently pulling my IUD out. (0/10 do not recommend) in my infinite idiocy I got another IUD... 

...So back to pads.

The thing about pads is that they don't play well with boxer briefs. Even reusable pads pinned in place don't quite sit right. So for the past long while I've had to wear panties for a week every month. 

That's where the disphoria comes in. Because I want to burn this cutesy, butt-framing, bow-adorned scrap of fabric that rides up my ass crack and leaves me feeling both invaded and exposed. And all of its brethren too!

But today I wouldn't stand for it! And I made what is probably my most non-binary choice since coming out: I pinned my pad to my panties as necessary, put them on, and then put on a pair of boxer briefs over them. It was such a simple solution that I feel dumb that I didn't think of it months ago. But I feel so much better and my disphoria lifted like a flock of crows threatened with a double barrel shotgun made by Fruit of the Loom*. 

Period: 0, Disphoria: 0, SGTree: 1

Ok so hello everyone this might get a little long so sit back and let me tell you my story. I am a 14 year old who was male at birth. I’m currently in 8th grade- Ever since the summer between 5th and 6th grade I’ve felt traces of gender fluidity. About a year later I had known how I felt about myself-male some days-female others- and sometimes neither. At birth I was given the name Seth but I personally do not think it fits me very well at all. I have recently grown to love the name Vail. I feel feminine about 50% of the time and masculine about 30% the other twenty percent is a mix of both or neither.

I have not come out to anyone but my best friend so far and that is a big part of the small-ish story I’m about to tell you....  

About 1 week ago my family woke up and my father decided we would go to church. While my entire family is very religious I personally don’t share the same views and am an atheist. I was feeling very feminine that day and dreaded putting on the dress clothes my family liked on me. On my way out the door I noticed that my mom was still in her pajamas. I recalled a few other times that she had not come and asked, ”Why don’t you ever come to church with us?” Now, I know I could have worded this better and I knew that as soon as I said it. My mom was not going because she was sick and I had forgotten. She turned around and started to half cry. She told me, “I don’t need this now,” and walked away into the kitchen. 

My dad then slapped me (not super hard) on the back of the head and told me “what were you thinking” my sister was bringing her friend with her to church that day so I was being watched by my sister as well as her friend. During the car ride I was told “do you even care about people’s feelings”, “what do you have against your mother”, and “is this you now? Are you just going to be insensitive?” Now, I felt really bad from hurting my mom’s feelings and the day so far so this made me feel even worse. I felt a level of confusion, guilt, and dread greater than I’ve ever felt before. I had a meetup with my best friend for the first time this year and my dad canceled that. 

After we arrived my dad dropped the girls off so he could park the car and bring me in separate. As we were walking in I stopped for a second to calm my brain. My father then turned around and yelled “Is there something you want to say to me!?” Humiliated and hurt I replied with a quiet “no.” My dad gave a sharp “good” then turned around to go into church. My head was so full of emotions and I couldn’t take them anymore. I bolted in the opposite direction, running down the street as fast as I could. I was in an vastly unfamiliar city far away from the house I had just moved into. As I was running I powered down my phone so I couldn’t be tracked, I needed to be alone.

4 months earlier I had reached a breaking point in stress and at 12 am I had snuck out of my old house (where we were living at the time) and grabbed a scooter from my garage. I had no phone and no food. I just rode the scooter as far as I could. Eventually I was 5 miles away and I didn’t know how late it was so I made my way to my friends house. They drove me home where I had to wake up my asleep mom and tell her what had happened.

This was on my mind as I ran.  

I was being chased by my slower dad and I turned a corner and then slid into a nearby alleyway. I hid behind one of the dumpsters there for 45 ministers. I never checked my phone. Soon a worker began working on a nearby building so I left. I walked for about 20 minuets until I got to a local high school. It was Sunday so I didn’t have to worry about students . I found a bleacher by the baseball field and sat there for a solid hour. At one point I tried to climb the brick wall of the school to jump off the roof.       

Soon I had no idea how long I had been out so I turned my phone on. I immediately got a “find my phone” alert. I turned off my phone then ran some more. I stopped about half a mile away in a nature park. 

I turned on my phone once more, entered my passcode, and turned on airplane mode before my location could get pinged.

I had 27 texts; from my mom, dad, and sister. My sister said she couldn’t live without me and that she needed me. My dad told me he was sorry for everything and he just loved me and didn’t want to loose me. I started to make my way back to the church where I had ran from. Once I got there I called my dad and he told me not to move and that he was on his way.

Once he got there we hugged each other for a solid minute. He told me he was so sorry and will never treat me like that again. I forgave him and told him how sorry I was for running away. I had been gone for 3 hours and my dad called the police to stop looking for me. He asked what we should do next and I decided we should go home. 


Once home I had given my mother a huge hug. She was mad because of how I had made her worry and how much inconvenience it caused. She told me not to run from my problems and to face them head on. 

So that’s why I am here today asking what to do next. I still have not told my family about my gender identity and don’t know how. I’m afraid they will take it as a phase, trying to get attention, or trying to be like other people.  They have had similar responses to other things in the past. 

Me and my dad are ok now and we love each other. The only person who knows my identity is my best friend who happens to be lesbian. 

If you made it this far then thank you so much for listening and being there for me. 

Now that you know my situation can you help me find a way to tell them. I will be seeing a therapist soon and I don’t know if I should come out of the closet when it’s just me and him. 
Please help.

Thanks a million -Vail

2017-12-17 07:28:48,7kclo5,5,20,"Hi all.  I'm a 24 year old gay cis-male.  I came out this year publicly although I'd been out to my friends for a year or two prior to that.  It's been a long journey of just coming to terms with my sexuality due to the religious brainwashing I was subjected to growing up.  I'm still sort of questioning a lot of things to be honest.  And I realize that it's not something where I can just snap my fingers and have all my questions magically answered but perhaps you'll allow me a venting?  I identify as gay because I feel that it fits me best but it doesn't exactly explain the crushes I've had in the past on a few girls.  I think perhaps I could be like 80-90% gay... Anyways, my preference is for men.  Moving on to my next issue.  I basically feel comfortable as a guy... In a way. Like, I don't experience what I hear other people talking about as dysphoria in regards to my genitals. However, I am exploring my feminine side and I don't really know what it means Despite never being super masculine, I feel comfortable as being a guy.  I do however enjoy presenting as a bit more feminine and I don't actually know what it means for me.   Maybe by me writing down my thoughts, some of you who experience similar things could help explain it to me?  Growing up, I spent lots of time with girls as friends and women of the family.  I spent time with them shopping and such.  I don't know anything about makeup or fashion though.  Lol.  Like I start drawing blanks if someone asks me if something goes with something else.  But when I was a kid I remember getting my ass whipped because I snuck into my older sister's room and painted my nails with her stuff.  I remember being yelled at about how boys don't do that.  Granted, I had pretty fucked up parents but I won't go into that today.  Last summer I got to leave the region for a summer internship and while I was there, I kind of sheepishly asked some of the girls there to let me try on some of their makeup and stuff (eyeliner, eyeshadow) because I was out to everyone there and had always wanted to try it.  Something just clicked with me.  I felt good wearing it.  I loved having makeup on.  Now that I'm out and estranged from my parents, I get to do stuff that I want.  I paint my nails on a regular basis and I even wear lipstick occasionally.  Something about it is very freeing to me.  I don't know if it's because in a way it's me rebelling against the toxic things that I was taught and the hateful people formerly in my life, or if I truly am an effeminate guy and this is me physically expressing what's on the inside.  The irony is that I'm an extremely outdoorsy person and spend lots of time getting dirty out in the woods and stuff.  So you might see me with my nails painted and wearing purple lipstick and at the same time i'm looking through the mud for a snake or a plant I'm searching for, etc.  I'm kind of a walking oxymoron at times.  This weekend a new friend introduced me to Justin Sayre and his order of sodomites channel on youtube and I've been binge watching.  I find him hilarious and seeing this bearded, burly guy wearing jewelry, female clothes and heels kind of opens my mind to the possibilities.  I don't know that I'm wanting to go super femme, but I do want to explore makeup more and like I saw him wearing certain feminine articles of clothing and I was like I want that!  I want to own that and wear it.  It looks nice.  It looks like me.  But I just don't actually know what this all means.  I don't really know how to best explore it.  I don't know what it's going to mean for me socially as I'm in the Deep South where people point and make rude comments if I wear lipstick to the store.  I don't know what it means in terms of WHO and WHAT I am.  I guess I experience toxicity towards feminine gay men enough that I'm scared to go down that road.  I think that's about it.

Another question I had is that, some youtuber made a video where they said sex was a social construct due to the billions of combinations of secondary sex characteristics and how genitalia can be born on a chromosome setup its not normally born on. So should we also consider sex a social construct? Also this is a dumb question but, if we do consider it that.

2017-12-22 15:49:25,7li7y5,14,15,"Greetings,

Last time I posted here I was still figuring myself out. After graduating from College (and remembering something someone said to me a while ago) I realized what makes me a genderqueer/fluid person.

Never cared much about dressing as the opposite sex (though I tried it once and liked the feeling of girl clothes, but didn't like my overall appearance while wearing them). Yet, I always knew there was something ""feminine"" about me: I used to have Sailor Moon toys and Shojo mangas (japanese comics for girls) and I usually get disgusted at the way men talk about/to and treat women (although I'm not much better at it myself, for other reasons).

However, more imporantly, by looking back at my life, I finally figured that I've experienced many of the things women have dealt with their entire lives: harrasment, groping and catcalling by men, being demanded to look/behave/think according to the sexual organs between my legs, etc.

2017-12-23 04:22:36,7lmm6w,6,9,"Hey, I started a mtf hormonal transition in 2015 (I think), but I got so many doubts in my mind that I wasn't sure enough of it, so I interrupted it, in order to avoid making decisions I was unsure of, because I felt like I could regret it in the future.

&amp;nbsp;

Why did I want to make a transition? because I felt identified with an article I read about a trans boy, in this interview he talked about his struggles throughout life and such, then I remembered all those feelings of ""I'm not expressing myself in the way I feel I am, I just merely adopted the way people treat me, and I just kinda merged with this mask, but even though I trained myself pretty good, but It doesn't feel right"" and that sort of stuff, I remembered all the times I would dress with my sister's and mom's clothes in secret and how I wanted to use makeup in a feminine way but they wouldn't let me, etc

&amp;nbsp;

I found a therapy group where we would meet and share thoughts of our problems/achievements, an online community, and the support of my family (that last one wasn't quick but it turned out well)

&amp;nbsp;

When I stopped, I thought I was just agender, because genders itself seemed like a game of customs and outfits and body languages to me, like, with rules and such, rules you don't have to necessarily care about

So that was in theory, and I thought about these things in one way, but in the end I felt different, I felt like I wanted to be a cute girl, with the opportunity of expressing myself in a different way, where I imagine it would fit me better, instead of how I feel now: a robot that learned how to behave like a normal guy 

&amp;nbsp;

but, the doubts remain


Because when I see a girl I find cute, I don't know if I want her to like me by behaving like a guy, having a beautiful close to Bruce Lee-like body I trained and in the end be by her side, or I want to be like her and feel femenine and beautiful and live like that, and I imagine combining the two of those things but it doesn't seem appealing to me


And I don't know why, y'know? I deconstructed the binary genders and sex orientations in my head, so why can't I combine this stuff?

&amp;nbsp;

Like I told you, I analyzed it, and I understand the logic of it in one way, from a non-binary perspective, but I end up feeling with binary judgements


I thought ""hey, maybe I can have a cute femenine face but a fit and trained male body"" but I actually don't want that, even if it makes sense to me.



&amp;nbsp;


plus, I also have the doubt of this being just a fetish I have, it could be, right?
It's like, half of the time I masturbate to straight porn thinking about me being the guy, but the other half of the time I feel like I'm the girl, and sometimes I don't even know so I just feel like I'm the guy and the girl at the same time so I just don't even know what the heck I'm feeling.

2017-12-24 10:55:57,7lummn,7,19,"Hello everyone.  Idk if this is the right place to be asking but Im not sure who else if anybody would come close to understanding, alright so here goes 

&amp;nbsp; 

So,I am a very gender fluid individual, this caused me alot of grief in my college years I'm now 23, xy chromosome (born male) For the longest time I tried to live as other expected me to live and basically had a miserable life. Just last year I hit the breaking point in my depression and became suicidal. Once killing myself was on the table as a viable option that had the strange effect of making drastic life changes alot more appealing.

&amp;nbsp;

So instead of killing myself I decided to drop-out of college, move somewhere with affordable rent and start adult-webcam modelling to pay bills. I know some people think of that as a sort of ""bad"" profession but If i had to continue working the job I was at I would have literally killed myself so try to understand.. so fast forward about a year now, I became *very very* popular as a model, I've been able to buy a small house, pursue my interests, I am no longer depressed. I'm very happy with life now. 

&amp;nbsp;

When I first made this change though, my mindset went along the lines of  this ""I hate life so much, so I'm going into sex modelling so I can at least enjoy life for a little while and then ill kill myself when I'm too old to model""  I made this choice thinking I would be able to live for about 10-15 years and I made peace with that. And should things eventually come to that I still think it will be better than going back to the life that I had. 

&amp;nbsp;

However I'm no longer depressed, I want to live and form relationships, if its possible I want to live my full life, And because Ive grown so popular camming I'm beginning to think that I may be able to continue into age 40-50 if I take good care of my body since there is a market for that age group as well, If I save money and start investing in a retirement plan I could maybe even live the whole life that I want. 

&amp;nbsp;

however, there are a few things im worried about. I said I was gender fluid, well the reason I'm popular as a cammer is because I have pretty female attributes, despite never having been on hormones with a little makeup and cute clothes I look attractive enough I suppose. However I know that Testosterone continues to masculinize throughout ones life and im worried that I wont look feminine enough to continue camming this way If I dont do something to feminize or at least prevent the further masculinization of my body. I wouldnt mind living life on the female side of the spectrum since I consider myself neither anyway. However I also need my penis to keep working... 

&amp;nbsp;

So thats my predicament, Am I overblowing the changes my body will undertake as I get older? Do you think it is possible to take some sort of low dose of estrogen or anti-androgens to lightly feminize my body without having it kill my sex-drive and give me ED?. 

If its life or death (which it is in a way) I've also been considering saving for some sort of plastic surgery, I'm lucky enough that I make enough now to afford it if I save up a little bit, Would it be a better idea instead of messing around with hormones to do some feminizing plastic surgery?  for example I could undergo Body-Countouring and Facial feminization surgery and I think that might put me over the edge I need to work long enough to save for retirement. All of this would set me closer to my personal gender expression as well as a bonus.

&gt; I think I am fundamentally a straight ciswoman. I don't think I have gender dysphoria, but I would still like to better understand my gender and sexuality.
&gt;
&gt;I am sexually attracted to both sexes equally, but I am only romantically attracted to men, and have only had male partners.
&gt;
&gt;I was a ""tomboy"" as a child. I hated my early puberty, but came to terms with it. I developed a very feminine figure, and eventually started wearing feminine clothes.
&gt;
&gt;I still think, walk and talk in a noticeably masculine way (I don't have a deep voice, but I use male speech patterns). I possibly identify as male cerebrally, but I am content to appear female outwardly.
&gt;
&gt;Title says it all. I simply want to gain a better understanding of my gender and sexuality. I suffer from depression and thought that maybe I might feel happier if I felt clearer about my identity. At the very least, perhaps if I learn more about gender and sexuality, I might be in a better position to understand my transsexual and genderqueer friends.

I totally forgot that I'd made this thread, didn't really think about gender again for a while, and then a year later I basically had a mental breakdown and figured out that I was transgender. I never actually came to terms with puberty or with looking like a girl, and I was repressing my gender dysphoria and body image issues so badly that I was dissociating.

I now would describe myself as a pan non-binary trans guy, and I'm out to all of my friends and family (most of whom were supportive). I've been on testosterone for just over a year, and for nearly as long I've been in a romantic relationship with another non-binary person.

Sometimes, I dress girly, sometimes, not. I'll go through phases of men's slacks and phases where I prefer dresses. Because of the insecurities of past partners, I kept my gender expression out of the bedroom. Until my current partner, I've always been the one with the higher sex drive. This was challenging enough for them. (Though I'm queer, I've mostly dated cis-men.)

My current partner is a trans man (who has been on T for four years, and is consistently read as male). He doesn't have bottom dysphoria, though he does feel vulnerable when I use a dildo to penetrate him.

For various reasons, I had shut down when it came to communicating my sexual wants or desires. With my current partner, I'm opening up, both about gender and sexuality. Yesterday, I admitted to my partner that I've had very occasional sex dreams where I've been the male and that I'm the male in about 5% of my sexual fantasies. This was something that I had never even written down for myself.

It went well, of course. He said that he'd be okay with me acting those fantasies out - which blows my mind because of his own vulnerabilities. He also said yesterday that he wanted me inside him (I'm away visiting family) which kind of blew my mind. I've never had anyone say that to me before.

Anyway, I just wanted to share, to try to articulate this. I'm so thrilled in my relationship. I'm probably 75% submissive, but a little dominant. I feel like my gender slides around and shifts... and I have this sliver of male sexuality that I've never looked at. Also, looking at his body and seeing a male body and a vagina is affirming.

I used to have *really* bad gender dysphoria that plagued me almost constantly. In spite of this, I didn't want to medically transition, so I felt pretty hopeless in regard to options for minimizing my dysphoria. Over a year and a half ago, I had to make a pap smear appointment (I'm AFAB) and I was really anxious about it for obvious reasons, so since I like smoking weed, I thought taking a CBD pill would at least temporarily alleviate the dysphoria during the appointment. I decided to test my idea by taking a CBD pill a week or so before my appointment, and *miraculously*, my gender dysphoria was *cured*.

I shit you not, after the effects of the pill fully kicked in, my dysphoria was *gone*. It completely stayed that way until my identity changed to one that is so unique in that it is different from my four other genders, and I guess the gender dysphoria stayed with that particular one? So I took a CBD pill again to try to cure the dysphoria like I did the first time, and it took a few tries, but I was able to cure it partially. By ""partially"", I mean I felt like I was attached to my body (as opposed to detached, like gender dysphoria makes one feel), but my chest made me feel uncomfortable. My gender dysphoria stayed this way for about a year and a half until I got a short haircut earlier this month, which made me feel even *more* dysphoric about my chest and presenting femininely, although I still didn't feel psychologically detached from my chest or anything. I could tell that this mental gender discomfort was getting more intense, tho. One night 10 days ago I decided to smoke again because I felt like it, not expecting anything surprising to happen, and after the effects of the weed fully kicked in, the gender dysphoria that remained after the second time I took CBD pills was, once again, *completely* gone, and it's stayed that way ever since.

**TL/DR:** I learned through personal experience that medical marijuana can *cure* gender dysphoria, and I don't want this to be something to keep to myself. I want more people to know about this, that this is a path they can take if they don't want to medically transition.

I've ID'd as FtM for years at this point, and I've been taking T for almost a year and a half.

So no matter what, I have zero intention of stopping that.

Since I've started becoming more comfortable in my body and mentally smoothed out, I've been able to start reflecting on myself and who I am on a deeper level. I feel like working on my dysphoria is now less frantic damage control and trying to stop the bleeding, and instead more careful suturing and long-term planning. As I've been thinking lately, I'm starting to debate whether or not I'm some level of NB. Physically, there were some more feminine aspects of myself I didn't totally hate (Like my hips), and I feel like I'd be happiest in a very androgynous-to-masculine type look in terms of my body and face. And mentally, at times the idea of being a ""man"" makes me a little unhappy. It's better than being a woman, but not optimal.

But here's the thing, I'm not sure if I'm feeling that way because I *actually* feel that way, or because of how men are viewed and talked about in certain circles. And I'm gonna have to preface here that I'm not trying to go on some shitty meninist-style rant here. I'm a staunch feminist.

I've had people tell me that it's just a coping mechanism for trauma, but as a victim of rape myself, that doesn't really do much to make the comments less hurtful.

The social concept of gender is based roughly off of the ideas of masculinity and femininity, males characterised by a preponderance of the former and females of the latter. The genderqueer community and its allies takes the stance that a binary system is illogical, oppressive and a  misrepresentation of the truth and thus some people identify as genderqueer in general or - fluid, a-, bi-, tri-, pan- etc. However, I dont immediately have a good answer to the question of why the community wants to keep gender identities at all. Rather espousing the idea that masculinity and femininity are outdated and people should just act as they feel comfortable. I understand identification in relation to building a liberation movement for those impacted by social pressures and oppression, but as a goal it seems to be a little peculiar to support a system which does still differentiate ""masculinity"" and ""feminist"".

""A Coming Out Email

Sit down, get comfy, and play some Diana Ross because I’m coming out (again)!

We’ve had a similar talk before and it went well, so I’m hoping this one does too. Sorry this is so out of the blue but I didn’t think there’d be a fantastic time to bring it up anyway. It might be a surprise to you and it might not, I dunno. Anyways, here we go!

I’m nonbinary. 

I dunno if you’ve heard of that before but if you had it was probably on This Morning or GMB and they’re always transphobic and disrespectful so please ignore what they have said and let me explain (there will also be some links to info about trans and nonbinary people and terms I’ve mentioned at the end of this). 

I’m nonbinary. “Nonbinary” is a gender identity the same way “man” or “woman” is, except it falls outside of (or between, for some people) those two binary genders - hence, *non*binary. It also falls under the “transgender” umbrella term. 

I experience dysphoria (there’s a link for an explanation of that at the end) surrounding my pronouns, gendered terms being used for me like daughter, girl, woman etc., as well as dysphoria surrounding my body and not looking as androgynous as I feel that I should. I’ve also had growing discomfort with my name being feminine and might want to change it, so I’d like you to at least have a say in that. These things all make me feel really uncomfortable and while I tried to ignore them for a long time, I couldn’t anymore. 

I’ve already come out to friends and they now use they/them pronouns for me and I want you to do the same. An example would be “They’re going to tech”, and “They left their coat in the car”. Please also avoid saying stuff like “This is my daughter” and instead use “child” or something. Like I said, I’m not a woman or a man so I’d much rather use neutral terms. It’ll take a while to get used to but I would really appreciate the effort. We can talk about names later because this email is already long. 

I already wear a lot of men’s clothes so no need to really say anything else about that except that I’m more comfortable dressing more masculine but you probably know that already like. I am however planning to get a binder (it’s like a tight crop-top-looking thing that flattens your chest. Don’t worry, I’d be getting a good one from a good company so it’ll be perfectly safe) so that I can alleviate some dysphoria. 

So yeah. I’m trans/nonbinary. Sorry this was such a long email, there was just a lot to cover. If you have any more questions or want me to clarify anything please ask. I’d rather you ask me stuff (either in person or via text or whatever) than just assume things that might be wrong.

I've told her, for instance, about getting diagnosed with depression and how my mental health getting worse has caused my college life to tank. She was sympathetic, but culturally, depression is something that's been popularized enough to the point where we all have clear ideas in our heads about how a depressed individual might behave, and my mom could see that written all over my face.
