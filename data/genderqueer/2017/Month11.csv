To make things short, I have fibrocystic chest tissue. This makes small/moderate sized lumps that are noncancerous, but frankly annoying, sometimes painful, and awfully foreign feeling. 

My doctor (pediatrician) said that if I was feeling any pain that I should go to her. 

I am planning to bring up the issue of pain at my next physical (a couple of months late by now). 

There’s a medicine called danazol that can almost completely shrink the lumps by 6 months or at least a year, and in addition it slows estrogen production and is (mildly..) androgenic and anabolic. 

It can have  “side effects” I really want, like  lowered voice and hair growth, with a decreased potential for bottom growth. 

I have no idea how to talk this over with my doctor. I don’t know if she would tell my parents why I want to take it, in addition I’d want to shoo my mom out of the room as well. 

Anyone have any tips for talking to your doctor about stuff like this? I’m stellarian/agender and I’m afraid she won’t take me seriously if I told her I’d only felt trans for about 2 1/2 years.

2017-11-08 16:57:30,7bmm3i,12,12,"Hi all, I’m looking for a little advice about my possibly genderqueer/transgender son.  Basically, I’m not sure if he’s just being a four year old or if there’s more going on.  

Last week, my son(?) told me hysterically that he wanted to be born a girl.  This was in response to a discussion about how only women can breastfeed babies because of mammary glands.  I told him he could pretend though.  He’s expressed a desire in the past to be a mom and have babies (he has a younger brother and a new baby sister), but I didn’t think much of it because he spends the majority of time with me (his mom).  I assumed it’s just what he sees and knows, and of course being a mom is wonderful.  Otherwise, he’s never struck me as uncomfortable with being cis-gender.  

In response to my son’s hysteria, I consoled him saying that he can be anyone he wants to be; he could be a girl if he wants to; all I want is for him to be happy.  I asked him if he wants me to call him a girl, and he said yes.  Over a few conversations the next few days, he’s maintained his desire to be girl.  He doesn’t want to share this with his friends, but teachers and friends’ families are okay.  I haven’t asked him if he wants to dress any differently out of a desire to not stereotype the clothes he already has.  Not more than 5 minutes after one of these conversations, he asked to get a hair cut (he already has pretty short hair).  He said when he grows up he wants to be a man.  But he’s also said “when I’m a kid, I want to be a girl.” And “some days I want to be a girl and some days a boy.”  When asked how he feels like a girl, he said “in all my body parts.”

I consider my husband and myself to be fairly progressive with our parenting — we make a big effort to not gender toys, clothing, actions, jobs, etc.  But still, we refer to our son with male terms.  We shop (with a few exceptions) in the boys’ section of clothing stores.  This week, I’ve been making an effort to just use his name, not gendered pronouns.  And female pronouns when necessary.  He doesn’t seem to care.  I really think he would be comfortable expressing himself any way he wants to, which is why the sudden desire to be a girl was so shocking.  

So any thoughts?  If this is the start of a journey, I want to support him.  But right now, I can’t tell if he’s just being a child and exploring things, or if he is seriously expressing a desire to not be cis-male.  If it’s the latter, what should I do?  I’d rather follow his lead, but I’m not sure what the best way to do it is.

First, I used genderqueer as the umbrella term for gender nonconforming folks instead of trans (for ref my friend is trans and I identify as NB). I think trans is binary, and really excluding (bc it is a specific label in itself already!) , and it makes more sense to me as a parallel to queer as the umbrella to sexual minorities (side note does anyone oppose to that use of queer?). 

Second, I identify as biromantic. I use bi instead of pan- or poly- romantic bc pan usually implies no gender preference from what I've seen (and I highly prefer NB folks over men over women) and poly is so easily confused with polyamorous. Not to mention, I just personally relate to the label more and there is an established bi community.

Both Tinder and OKCupid allow you to list your gender as something other than male or female. However, both still require you to decide if you'd rather be included in searches for men or women. I don't really understand why they can't have a third category for people who'd rather not be included as either of those, but whatever.

If you use those sites/apps, how do you decide if you'd rather show up in searches as a man or a woman? Do you go by your own comfort level/self-identification? Which gender you typically pass as? Your transition goals (if any)?

I feel like letting myself be listed as a woman is probably the lowest-pressure option right now. I'm AFAB and haven't transitioned except for coming out as non-binary. I'm undecided about medical transition. I like the idea of having a male body, but I don't really mind how my body is right now for the most part. But I do see myself as more of a guy than a woman, and when I try to navigate online dating, I'm very self-conscious about how people see me. I worry about people seeing my profile come up in a search for women and deciding that, regardless of what my profile says, I'm basically a woman. But calling myself a man feels like a lot of pressure when realistically, I know that most people who are looking for male partners probably won't find me attractive in that way.

HOWEVER, shaving is, um, not the greatest thing for me.  Maybe I'm doing it wrong, but it seems like some demented god of body fuzz has cursed me to look like a short, mange-ridden wookie, and any attempts to remove this with a blade lead to the kind of razor burn best described as malicious demons pissing on my legs.  It's upsetting.

A friend recommended Nair Men, and lo and behold, it actually kinda works.  Not the best on stubble or short hairs, but for long ones, excellent, as long as you follow directions.

Now, I'm certain some of you in here have expertise and skill in hair removal that deserves a black belt and the title of ""Most Honored Sensei"" (and if any of you wanna chime in and tell me what I'm likely doing wrong, feel free, oh my god, help).  However, I'm also sure some of you are, like me, just starting.

I hope this story helps you, or at least gives you a giggle at my expense.

So, I was doing Nair Men for the third time ever today (like I said, recent stuff). Now, I have this weird thing where, once a hand gets designated for a task, I tend to use that hand for that task.  I'm right handed, but certain things (scratching, straightening hair, fidget cube) are basically left hand only.

In this case, this was to my detriment.  My left hand had become ""Nair Hand"".  And I have a lot of area to cover.  My legs need to be bare for my peace of mind, as does my ass, as well as chest and stomach.  Coating my everything takes about 15-20 minutes.  You aren't supposed to leave Nair on you for more than ten minutes, and for my body, I'd taken this into account.  I finish my left leg, check time, finish right leg, check time, make notes when to start wiping, and so on.

However, it had completely eluded my inexperienced self that there was Nair on my left hand this entire time.  For three treatments over about a week and a half.

So, I'm doing my treatment today, getting some cream, smearing it on, getting some cream, smearing it on, getting som-- OH MY GOD, MY FINGERS ARE BURNING.

I now have a mild chemical burn on the pads of two fingers on my left hand.  It isn't horrible, and I'm sure it will heal within a short time, less if I get some Aloe on it.

However, that hurt.  Like, papercut meets Bic lighter hurt.

So, if you use Nair Men, spiffiness, stuff is decent.  However, wear gloves, or swap hands, or rinse your hand frequently during.

Really, if this saves one person pain and embarrassment, totally worth typing out.

And again, if anyone has hair removal tips, I'm a damned empty cup here.

2017-11-18 19:21:05,7dv2e4,9,10,"So, I'm a 28 year old AMAB person who has never truly felt like a man. I've always had this awkward ""never fitting in with the guys"" deal that is partly fueled by being a kinda nerdy person. Even when I am around nerdier guys, however, I feel like I need to put up a front that doesn't allow me to be expressed as the nerdy person I truly want to be in the vein of still being a guy.

Like, I find it easier to connect with girls, however I feel awkward wanting to become friends with them since, well, I'm also attracted to them. I find it very hard to feel like I can approach women in more open social situations and strike up conversations since I'm seen as a guy. What woman wants a guy coming up and randomly talking to her?

Like, if I was able to dress how I wanted, I'd probably toss just about all of my guy clothes and dress in girl clothes. If I was able to express myself physically how I wanted, I'd probably be somewhat into makeup and into wigs and other things. If I was able to shape my body how I wanted, I'd probably be shaped like a very athletic female. If I was able to express myself sexually the way I want, I'd probably be a flaming lesbian (now, I am attracted to the idea of penises, penises turn me on like crazy, the same way pussy does, only different, if that makes sense, I just don't have an attraction to men, men don't turn me on at all).

Like, about the biggest thing that I find it hard to say is ""I'm a woman,"" that feels wrong. Everything else about wanting to feel female feels right, just being called a ""woman"" feels wrong, even though ""she"" feels better to me than ""he"" and a slightly feminine name feels better to me than my own.

Like, I have found the term ""demigirl"" and it seems to fit me the most. If I had to use labels to describe myself, they'd probably be ""genderqueer demigirl lesbian.""

Even when I am around nerdier guys, however, I feel like I need to put up a front that doesn\'t allow me to be expressed as the nerdy person I truly want to be in the vein of still being a guy.\n\nLike, I find it easier to connect with girls, however I feel awkward wanting to become friends with them since, well, I\'m also attracted to them. I find it very hard to feel like I can approach women in more open social situations and strike up conversations since I\'m seen as a guy. What woman wants a guy coming up and randomly talking to her?\n\nLike, if I was able to dress how I wanted, I\'d probably toss just about all of my guy clothes and dress in girl clothes. If I was able to express myself physically how I wanted, I\'d probably be somewhat into makeup and into wigs and other things. If I was able to shape my body how I wanted, I\'d probably be shaped like a very athletic female. If I was able to express myself sexually the way I want, I\'d probably be a flaming lesbian (now, I am attracted to the idea of penises, penises turn me on like crazy, the same way pussy does, only different, if that makes sense, I just don\'t have an attraction to men, men don\'t turn me on at all).\n\nLike, about the biggest thing that I find it hard to say is ""I\'m a woman,"" that feels wrong. Everything else about wanting to feel female feels right, just being called a ""woman"" feels wrong, even though ""she"" feels better to me than ""he"" and a slightly feminine name feels better to me than my own.\n\nLike, I have found the term ""demigirl"" and it seems to fit me the most. If I had to use labels to describe myself, they\'d probably be ""genderqueer demigirl lesbian.""

2017-11-24 20:34:23,7fa5rj,10,3,"So, this may be long, but I've been writing scholarly article length posts about this for the last three days and its kind of getting exhausting, so let me try to explain what's going on, and try to split this up the best i can. 

Who am i:
Well, i dont really know.. but AMAB, 22. 

whats this about: 
when i was young, i crossdressed, did girly things, had urges to look like a girl at times. time went on--no crossdressing or anything--2 years ago, HUGE URGE, then i questioned it--is it something bigger? went on crosssdressing reddit--talked with ppl, made my way to genderfluid reddit b/c i thought i fit there

why im here now:
2 years later, im back after a long hiatus, doing counseling at school about this, and questioning more. Back on reddit. Thought id visit this reddit to see what people thought. 

how i see it-

Right now, i feel like im nonbinary, or somewhere in this area... I like to dress up in womens clothes, i actually would love it if it wasn't stereotypically socially wrong for men to wear womens clothes and makeup, all that stuff. I do feel feminine and girly when these things happen, or even when i see or hear feminine things i get really interested and want to participate, more than any person would normally do. I love getting my nails done, even when im totally being in my male mode. (and this is like having bright pink acrylic nails lol). I would like to get my ears pierced and wear girly earrings--i have my hair long so i can have it look feminine. Ummm....idk.. i enjoy all these feminine things,and i do kind of wanna look more like a girl, but i don't really have an issue being a guy. I could do without looking manly though. I've never really been into it... (i really hate having body hair...) 

conclusion--
Basically...I don't really know exactly what all this means. I kind of feel like i mix into the crossdressing (though i feel like its a *tiny bit more than that, but i don't want to be just a crossdresser??), and nonbinary side of things, because of my expression outside of dressing up and such. I also am not very manly, and I don't really have an interest in masculine things.. 

I could say a ton more, but i feel like i've said enough.. 

thoughts? similar experiences? I'm not sure what i want to hear, or what i should expect. I've heard everything from ""you're just a guy who likes these things"" to ""you are transgender"".

2017-11-25 16:40:22,7fga3m,10,48,"Hi!  I just wanted to stop in and maybe introduce myself.

I'm AMAB, and from a very young age I knew I didn't fit the body I was in, but I didn't have the words or the environment in which to express that.  I struggled with it from the age of four up through the end of high school, at which time I managed to suppress most of my feelings of wrongness.

A couple of years ago it all came roaring back, but by this point I had a wife and a daughter, so I tried to run from it again.  I stayed far from anything feminine, cut my hair short, grew a beard, all trying to stave off this sense that I was not meant to be a man.  Eventually, when I finally gave in and came out as trans, it was *super* liberating.  It took me a while to get my wife to come on board, but she's bisexual and has always been very open-minded.

Lately, I've been struggling again, but in a somewhat different way than before.  I've been kind of, not quite *un*happy, but something still felt off in a way I couldn't quite articulate.  I've been to both sides of this great big binary, and neither side was *it*.

So I looked between the two, and started deconstructing what gender really meant to me, and to society.  I know I feel much more in-tune with womanhood and femininity, but I don't feel like that's exactly where I am.  These rigid roles that we're assigned based on the way we're perceived just seem so arbitrary, and I don't really fit into any of it.  I don't think I want to try anymore.

I sort of finally came to this realization last night, and since then I've felt that same relief and sense of freedom that I felt when I came out as trans.  It's been a long time since I've felt so at ease with myself.

That, um, got longer than I expected it to, but anyway hi!  I'm Liv, and I'm some kinda nonbinary transfemme person.",genderqueer,"Hi there.

What I'm not happy about is the reactions within myself I'm still trying to overcome, placed there from being raised male.  Anyone AMAB who went through your teenage years, you get this.  It's these knee-jerk, toxic masculine reactions to things feminine.

I just hope this voice slowly gets quieter.  Because it is an ass.

So, AMABs out there, if you have this voice, I feel you, and I'm sorry.  And just try to realize, like I am, that it isn't actually ""you"", it's toxic bits that society has crammed into you, conditioned responses forced by a sexist culture.

As a bonus, I don't really get periods at all anymore (been skipping the sugar pills for the last 5 years or so), so that's nice.
However, having been on it so long, I'm not really sure what the normal me is. It caused a lot of breast growth, which I've never been comfortable with, and I really do wonder if it is causing a more feminine body fat distribution. (But also I started it around the time I was going through puberty so maybe this is what would have happened to my body anyway?) I think it's also killing my sex drive, and I feel like that gets worse all the time (I went from having a slightly low one in high school, to a lower one in college, and now in my thirties sex does not even cross my mind at all for weeks at a time, and I haven't had any sort of sexual contact or desire/interest for it in about three years.)
My gyno says I need to stay on it to prevent growth of cysts, which I guess were causing my horrible periods. So going off the pill (and getting something like an endometrial ablation) is not an option.
Has anyone gone on testosterone while on birth control? Is that even a thing you can do? Has anyone had similar experiences with being on birth control long term and going off it, losing feminine fat distribution, etc., or is that permanent?
