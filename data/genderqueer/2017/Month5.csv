2017-05-02 15:48:54,68txaz,24,14,"One huge gender thing that has always bothered me is crying, like, I often feel like I want to cry but can't.  I feel emotions very intensely and I often struggle to express or process them in healthy ways.  I'm convinced that my difficulty with crying is a combination of both social factors and hormonal factors.  When I have cried in public, sometimes people have comforted me but a few times I've had adults condemn or criticize me, or react angrily, a reaction I rarely see directed at women.  I also grew up in a fairly traditional environment with a moderate dose of stereotypical toxic masculinity.

I also though have read about, and talked to people about experiences with hormonal transition, and people say it's definitely easier to cry with a female hormonal profile than a male one.  But I know men and other people with a male hormone profile can cry...my high school band director would cry all the time, in public, and I really liked him and admired how he could do that.  He'd get emotional about music, and also about his students, he cared so much for his students.

I'm not interested in HRT though for a wide variety of reasons, but this is one particular thing that I'd like to work on, because, for me, crying is often a really healthy and positive way for me to process my emotions, especially negative emotions.  I nearly always feel a kind of release after doing it.  I feel more calm and loving, and tend to think more rationally and positively after crying, which is one reason I really like it.

So far the most reliable thing I've found to help me cry is music.  Certain songs often (but not always) make me cry.  It's not super reliable though, and also not always available in every situation. I want to find some other ways of helping me cry when I want to.

I'd be curious to hear from any other AMAB people, or perhaps AFAB people who have gone on T too, or anyone really who has experienced the feeling of wanting to cry but not being able to.

2017-05-05 14:27:17,69ezqa,25,9,"Howdy, guys.

So, a personal thought battle has been bouncing in my head: and I genderqueer, or am I a gender non-confirming man?

I used to be adamant about that, saying I was still a cisgendered man, as I took on more femme qualities. I wanted to make a point that ""man"" was arbitrary, and it doesn't mean I *had* to be a certain way. What I hate the most is male gender roles: the expectations, the ""supposed to's."" I ""didn't want to"" be genderqueer, because I felt like that was ""giving up,"" and admitting that because of my preferred form of expression, I was not a man; that a man *is* this certain set of traits and gender roles.

Now, I reflect, and feel a bit uncomfortable with the term ""man"" (but not ""boy?""), as well as ""woman.""

I guess what I should just get to is the questions I'd like to ask other people:

If you're gender nonconforming, but not genderqueer, why don't you feel genderqueer?

Vice versa?

And what I would be very interested in hearing is gender nonconforming trans people: e.g., butch transwomen and femme transmen. What is it that makes you sure you're a gender different from you were assigned at birth, yet maintain traits of that gender?

I grew up Mormon smack in the middle of Utah Valley.

When I was about 11, I knew something was ""off"".
At 13 I was convincing myself I was ""just bisexual"" (I am aware of exactly how problematic that statement is) and that I'd get over it and still get a wife and kids and live out the dream.
At 16, I knew I was gay and came out to some close friends.
At 18, I came out to my parents, both of whom were worried, but supportive.

I'm 24 now. I've been a hobbyist sfx artist for two years, and a social dancer for 6 years. Last weekend I went out in the most ""femme"" styling I've ever done. Took my makeup skills and attempted some beauty makeup, I got m'self some heels, and I went dancing.

I've identified as a cis male for my entire life, even with all of my sexual questioning. Even now I consider myself solidly content with my born gender, but when I started to push at these norms I grew up with... when I said ""fuck it"" and put on eye shadow, lipstick and heels, I don't think I've ever felt such a rush of excitement and relief all at the same time.

Here's to hoping more lines are blurred, more barriers are broken down, and through the crumbling of oppressive societal norms, we can enjoy each other for the spectrums that we are.

On one end, there is softness and tenderness. On the other, steel cut against the rocky face of a cliff. Its chunky and jagged, forcing itself into the crevices and creases of the cliff. The softness doesnâ€™t tame it, but merely coexists. Its fragrance hangs in the air. The softness is tender and hurts when it's touched without tact. The steel stands solid, yet dynamic. Its essence moves and grows with intensity, then becoming strong and still. 

The tender essence lives with the cliff, cohabiting the same space. They live in harmony together. Different but never in conflict or at war

 Pause.

This is where this place exists, where I exist. I am the pause between breaths, neither an inhale or an exhale, a place that is neither, both, in between. The place is neither here nor there, it exists on its own, yet exists in between, where tender squishy things thrive among blue steel.

The steel isnâ€™t always hard, the tenderness isnâ€™t always tender. They fuse and dance the waltz, they become one another. They erupt and burst from the sea to face the moonlit sky. The cliff stands on it own, aware of its uniqueness. Itâ€™s beautiful and proud. The waltz moves on, for all to see. 

Some interpret it as steel with softness, some view it as softness among steel. Some see something that is both, some that it is neither. They are all right. Their interpretations of the cliff are their own, they see where the beauty lies, but the cliff doesnâ€™t exist in the eye of the beholder. It simply is what it was meant to be.

Unique, alive, existing. Thats where I am. I exist as the pause between breaths, neither here nor there, both but neither. All who see me experience me in a different way. I am beautiful and unique as all people are beautiful and unique. This cliff is part of me, it exists in my belly. I carry and walk with it and wield it like itâ€™s made of light. I love experiencing it, and I hope you love it too.

2017-05-11 20:55:58,6amxt4,2,11,"(Edited to fix spelling mistakes x.x) Sorry for the long post.. But it's frustrating.

So for the past two years or so I've been frustrated and confused with my gender.  I didn't really think about it much before, but even when I was a teenager I felt like I was somewhere in between rather than being female or male. I *think* I'm non-binary but to be honest I'm not sure!

My parents are completely dismissive if I bring this up and think that my only 'issue' is not liking traditionally feminine things... Which may be true. I honestly don't know. I was AFAB and I think women are amazing and there's no real way to 'do' being a woman. But at the same time, I'm so tired of this gender binary. I feel that I can't say that I fit the female label without lying to myself, but I also feel like a fake when trying to fit the genderqueer label.

I've been using a chest binder and wearing suits and ties at work. Everyone at work uses she/her as pronouns for me because I'm not ""out"" - I'm so scared of them thinking I'm weird, and those pronouns don't bother me that much although I think I'd be happier if I was brave enough to tell people to use ""they"". What does bother me is that most of the time strangers also gender me as female no matter how hard I try to present more masculine. It's really weird saying that as an enby person, but I'm far more satisfied when people gender me male because it feels like at the very least my different presentation is working. I think my proudest moment was when someone I'd just met referred to me as ""this man"" to someone else, and she said ""that's a woman""  - they were maybe both wrong but that was probably my peak enby moment!

But at this stage, I don't know what to do. I want to present ""more enby"" I think, but I have all the good things fat AFAB women have (breasts and a butt). As I mentioned I have a binder and plenty of men's clothes. I was wondering, do I maybe need a smaller/tighter fitting binder? Or maybe a bigger one? Not sure which one would be better, but I feel like my ""girls"" aren't properly compressed. Another thing that bothers me is that I don't think I have my gender identity completely sorted out, either. I definitely don't think I'm trans male, but on the other hand I can't explain why I like the masc presentation so much. And I still think that it's possible that I'm a cis woman and this is all in my head or 'a phase'... So confused!

I appear very cis-female but inside I feel neutral. I'm not looking for advice, just want to throw around my thoughts**

First example - mom continues to get excited about including me in female-oriented situations like wedding/baby shower parties. The last time I went to one in high school I had a hard time enjoying myself because the booze was light and the conversation was overwhelming. At the time, I thought I couldn't handle it because of my introversion. But instead, I found out that women tend to get excited and talk about stuff that I just don't talk about.

Second example - I gather information about others and report in a relatively genderqueer way. Women want to know family and background details where men tend to prefer to stick to the current story in the discussion. I always get a variety of information, leading me to tell lengthy stories. It is also my personality to get really wordy and paint a mural almost forgetting the point of it all.

Third example - social expectation is that I am in a straight marriage, that we had a real wedding, want a house and are planning on babies. The reality is that the wedding was 4 minutes long at city hall so I could get 15k in grants from the government for school since I had no help from parents and their income didn't help things with FAFSA help. The reality is that I want to steal others' children, squeeze my kitty, and solidify being child-free for the rest of my life. While those are mostly based on my personality, my marriage is super gay and nontraditional. We still act like best friends who also hold the most intimacy with each other. As far as gender is concerned, I don't see his gender but respect that he is a cis-dude and he thinks it's cute and awesome that I now steal his jeans after hitting a weight loss goal. It always bothers us when people treat us like a typical hetero-norm couple and I have been upset by sexist remarks from his family that try to force me back into some pretty princess gender role. (I'll fucking push the car out of a ditch in a wool skirt if I damn want to!)

**What I've learned, how I cope, and where I'm at right now socially:**

I'm able to let it go now or speak up when someone assumes that my actions or reactions will be more typically female. It's interesting to watch people try to figure out why I respond in a more masculine way sometimes. Does not compute.

After coming out as bisexual/queer, minimalist, in a non-traditional 'marriage,' child-free, polyamorous, white Latina, and all the other weird things about me, I am pretty comfortable adding another concept to the pile, especially with the people I am close to.

But when I interact with people who don't know me, I am comfortable taking the time to explain why I am not as predictable. There are also people who want to analyze me, feel like they need to know everything in order to treat me 'correctly' or think that I am very insecure about who I am.

I am not insecure and yet sometimes I am insecure. The complications of human identity clash horrendously with the American individualization we are taught (which encourages fear and consumption). This is also something I am working on accepting.

I expect my NMom will spout off that it's silly/can't change/etc. or be supportive with the ulterior motive of renewing a relationship that never truly existed in the first place. I know a few family members will oppose it silently and my grandmother will bring up Jesus, which is going to be upsetting because I was so close to her growing up.

So I work for a mental health NHS trust. I recently took up a post in the children's hospital and met someone who came out as gay then genderqueer and works as a psychotherapist. There are also several trans children who are service users at our trust who are under the Gender Identity Development Service too.

So I decided after discussing it with my colleague and my partner to get a referral to the Gender Identity Clinic now run by the same NHS Trust as GIDS.

I wrote a post on Facebook after that, included all my family and friends but excluding my partner's family. So far, the response I've got is overwhelmingly positive but I think no one who opposes it would respond there given the support I've received.

They bounced back pretty well, but in my inspection the shoes, I found a label that had a size 10 and ""women"" written on it...I initially didn't think anything of it, since I know my size in ""women's"" Vans is 10. I then did a double take, my ""men's"" 8.5s are also labeled ""women's"" 10s.

I pointed it out to a friend of mine, and she said it was a misprint that technically shouldn't exist. She worked at a Payless, but is a bit of a Vans girl. She said that type of thing happens a lot.

2017-05-18 19:27:54,6byhrn,7,27,"Background: I went to the local FAA office this morning to get the name and gender marker updated on my pilot's license. (It has to match my driver's license, so I've gotta.) Walked out with a paper temporary in my new name, with an ""F"" on it.

So I was excited and posted a photo of the certificate on Facebook, along with a bit of snark (Doing my bit to increase the female pilot population! Overlooked diversity strategy: don't just encourage women to become pilots, encourage pilots to become women!). I took it down when I realized that nobody besides my wife and a few close friends know that I am actually legally a girl, and that between the snark and the license people were going to find out.

For over 10 years now I have happily identified as queer, but only in my sexuality. But I have been kind of questioning what gender means to me for years. I have never felt a strong connection to female or male, though there are plenty of traditionally masculine and feminine things that I like.

But the thing is... I'm AFAB and present as femme. I just feel like I am not genderqueer enough. I would love to present more masc at times but my body is not suited for the androgynous look. I have always had some discomfort with my body regarding my lack of a penis (sorry TMI), but I actually am pretty okay with my ""feminine curves"" and think I look killer in a dress.

And I know gender presentation and gender identity are not the same thing, and if another AFAB femme-presenting GQ told me this, I would reassure them 100% that they are legitimate. But I just feel like people are going to think of me as ""queering cis-ness"" or something. Which I could hardly blame them for, especially since I am married to a cis male (though we are poly).

I guess up until now all of this has kind of made me push gender questioning to the back of my mind, and since I don't have a pronoun preference (I'd happily go by either she/her, they/them, or he/his) or any serious dysphoria, I just figured if I ignored it, it would go away.

I was thinking about changing up my presentation just to see how it made me feel so if anybody has any tips on how a person with boobs (and I would rather not bind) and pretty thick thighs can pull off a more masc look I would appreciate it. I'm at least thinking of getting a more ""butch"" haircut and see how I like it (only thing is my MIL does my hair but that is a whole other cup o' drama).

I don't know. I'm sure society has conditioned me to feel safe presenting as femme, but I also don't want to present masc just to fit in with the queer community. How do you even figure out what is really YOU? There is so much pressure from every which way it seems impossible.

so i went to view the comments after and the first one was asking ""why a straight male would identify as queer"".  it was just really obviously a fishing terf thing, and the person turned out to be a gay man who continued to (purposefully) use male pronouns after being corrected and deny that bi people are different than straight. 

 all the other comments after seemed to be similar if not the same, and there seemed to be other people chiming in to talk about how ben was using drag to assault people. these were first because they were the highest voted comments.

the worst thing tho is that these were all comments that had been approved by a moderator as it clearly stated they were reviewed new comments.

Yesterday I went to a wedding and wore makeup and a low-cut dress with lots of cleavage (I'm a J-cup). I looked good, if I do say so myself.

It is extremely depressing to me that I will never be able to present as masculine when I want to.

Does anyone have any easy tricks to give a more masculine appearance when binding just doesn't cut it? Or words of encouragement?

And sure enough, despite speaking in my lower register and projecting my best 'I'm a dude today' vibes, I was called ma'am twice.\n\nIt is extremely depressing to me that I will never be able to present as masculine when I want to. I have short hair that's clipped close on the sides and back already, but it is bright red thanks to manic panic. Does anyone have any easy tricks to give a more masculine appearance when binding just doesn't cut it? Or words of encouragement? I still want to be able to go out in 'boy mode' even when others don't see it, but right now I'm feeling super self conscious that no one else is going to see me the way I see myself on those days.\n\nThanks in advance for any replies."", 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'First time leaving the house in a binder, mixed feelings, kinda depressed', 'created': 1495421767.0}"

I'm so darn stoked. I have hated my chest for my whole life. When it first started to grow, I felt like my body was pulling a prank. Why did all that stuff they talked about in health class have to happen to ME? 

But now I'm in California, where gender-affirming healthcare flows freely and I'm taking all the steps I can towards making my body a fun place for me to live. 

Dealing with all the doctors and therapists has been surprisingly easy. I found an awesome gender therapist who I'm continuing to see for stuff other than gender. All the doctors including the top surgeon had a Pronouns section on their paperwork. They even call me my preferred name! 

I was expecting the process of getting top surgery to be a huge problem since I'm nonbinary/genderqueer and not taking testosterone, but it's been so simple. Even my insurance company is being helpful. Go figure!

It feels kinda surreal to be on the threshold of a body I've been wanting forever. I'm just really excited to be able to wear tank tops in the ridiculously hot LA summer, and to be able to jump into the Pacific Ocean with a bare chest! Wahoo!

2017-05-22 16:35:07,6coc7n,10,18,"I am 31, AMAB and from Ormskirk, West Lancashire, United Kingdom.

Although I am happy as a male, I have been interested in presenting androgynously lately and am uncertain if this counts as an example of genderfluidity [if not androgyny].

Basic information:

- I haven't felt that I've ever had gender dysphoria, but reading articles about androgyny/genderfluidity had made me realize it was OK to be androgynous.

- I have never really had gender issues growing up.
- My friends are mostly women and older men.

- I live in a fairly conservative area 

- I am attracted mainly to women but have some attraction to men. 

- As a male, I am attracted mainly to women but some attraction to men. When presenting androgynously [which I have yet to do], mainly to women.

- My interests are mixed in terms of gender and stereotypical associations: automobiles [stereotypically masculine, and my username is implying I'm a fan of certain Japanese brands], web design / computing [mixed gender]

- I am not overly macho but not effeminate, being in the middle-ground [if there is one]. I don't think watching Lifetime/Hallmark movies counts as that. I like shopping [but more about gadgets or discounts/haggling as [/r/personalfinanceuk](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinanceuk) mentions, rather than clothes shopping].

- I did only once experiment with crossdressing [way back in November 2004] but it was not for any sexual purposes, or fetish - it was purely for experimentation's sake. Back in November 2004 I had never even heard of the words genderfluid or androgyne. I liked it when I did it then, but it didn't come back to me until i read about androgyny around late 2016.

- I [obviously] have no issues with LGBT or non-binary or other gender identities.

- I worry about how this would affect my dating life/relationships even though I present as male 100% of the time [for now].

- I am attracted to women who dress and/or act very feminine.

- I had been attracted to a transwoman once [in mid-2005] but did not know she was trans, so it was obviously not a ""chaser""-related thing, and I treat transwomen as women.

- My area does not have much for meeting LGBT individuals [or even Wigan, the next big town up the road from it]. I want to be able to meet new people / LGBT individuals but there isn't the opportunity to do so.

- I live at home with my parents [but in this day and age, it is socially acceptable and the basement dweller stereotype is probably outdated]. I haven't mentioned this to them because it's not something I think they will understand and it's probably [for now] not something they need to know about.

- Work and research projects have left me little time to explore this area of my life.

I will admit, I was considering doing this but am uncertain of how to do this safely.

I couldn't back then in 2004, since I did not know much about genderqueer or non-binary identities.

I cannot really pass as feminine being a 5""9 owlish-looking individual with a masculine face.

I'm trans-masculine nonbinary and I'm doing a summer research fellowship that pays for housing at what is essentially a dorming house in NYC. The rooms the program pays for are single-occupancy dorms on halls with communal Male and Female bathrooms.

2017-05-24 20:39:03,6d4uw7,26,134,"30 years ago, there was a girl who sat next to me in school who had purple glitter nail polish, and I thought it was amazing.

30 years ago, I asked for purple nail polish for my birthday and I was punished for that.

25 years ago, I don't want to talk about.

20 years ago, one day I painted my toes and was confused why it could make me so happy and so ashamed at the same time.

15 years ago, I ran with the goth crowd since it was acceptable to wear eyeliner and nail polish, I could dress however I wanted and I had some friends who had my back.

10 years ago, I had moved to a new place, and wore polish on my toes all the time because I liked it. Because I realized I could. I might even dare wear some manly gunmetal grey on my fingers when I was wearing a suit, because it matched my watch.

10 years ago, I was still completely unsure.

5 years ago, I saw another guy being bullied on a jobsite over and over, for being out. Being alt, for being effeminate, for being ""the gay"". For being different. And I got angry.

5 years ago, I got so angry that in fact, it forced me to start dealing with a lot of issues I had locked away.

5 years ago, I realized this is my body. I realized I'm 6'2"". I realized I'm 240lbs. I realized nothing is going to change that. 

5 years ago, I realized I'm a goddamed viking. I realized no one is gonna dare mess with me.

5 years ago, I cut out early for lunch and I came back with a manicure in bright neon pink.

5 years ago, there were stares, there were jokes.

5 years ago. I didn't say a word. I just stared them all down. Because I was a big imposing person and I could do that.

5 years ago, for one moment, I drew the ire away from someone who deserved a break from the hate. Someone who needed to know it was ok to be different. 

5 years ago, my crew chief called me in and asked me why, and I told them that ""it needed to be done for personnel reasons"". They knew damn well what was going on.

5 years ago, I got a silent look from 50 feet away that I know meant thank you.

5 years ago, I realized how brave he really was for being himself.

5 years ago, I stopped giving so much of my life to other people's opinions.

5 years ago, I carved out one little first step to firmly stand upon. And I am happier for it.

4 years ago, I realized that there were more options than just male or female.

3 years ago. I realized it's not the cloth or the paint or myself that is the problem.

2 years ago. I realized how scared I really am.

1 year ago. I realized I needed to talk to someone. 

A week ago I came out to a myself.

Yesterday I came out to a close friend. An actual human being.

And today. Today I will continue the life I almost ended 25 years ago because I couldn't begin understand how I felt.

I know that the hardest thing I will ever face is to be myself outside.

I will walk forward. I will come out to the world. I will be visible. I will be out.

For myself. For others who are looking for their own true self.

I am going have to take a hit every once in a while.  And I'm OK with that.

Thank you.
Sometime Sarah.

2017-05-26 13:48:57,6dh1z8,4,21,"Five years ago, when I made /r/DualGender and /r/bigender, I had to make a choice between the two. At the time, both terms were pretty interchangeable, and there weren't a lot of bigender people online that I could ask about which label they preferred. I went with the one that made the most sense to me at the time, and I figured using /r/DualGender would at least make it clear that the sub was about *gender*, and not something from Gulliver's Travels.

I knew launching one community would bring people together more easily than trying to launch two communities, and I worried that having two spaces would split people up, needlessly creating an arbitrary division where I was hoping to bring people together. I also didn't want to shake up a fledgling community by trying to move it to a new subreddit while it was still growing and getting established. So I closed one of the subs, leaving it empty, and added a redirect link to the one which had people and more activity, /r/DualGender.

However, as the years have passed, the term 'bigender' has grown in popularity and prominence. It's become the default term, and even I'm updating my label and my personal terminology to get with the times.

Meanwhile, /r/DualGender, always a quiet little sub, has sort of trundled along under the radar. Lately, I've been getting fresh messages in /r/bigender's modmail, asking for invites into the closed sub. I get a new one every couple of weeks; about a dozen since January.

So here are my questions: 

Should I open /r/bigender, or keep encouraging folks to head to /r/DualGender?  
If I open /r/bigender, will people use it?  
Should I leave both subs open, or should I try to redirect folks from /r/DualGender to /r/bigender?  
If I open /r/bigender, what sort of space would you like it to be?

I'm pretty certain I'm going to open /r/bigender, regardless, but this community is incredibly dear to me, and I want your feedback before I get started.

So far the few subtle signs of my queerness have largely slipped under the radar, but as I progressively question myself and end up increasingly transfeminine - I'm a little afraid that people won't like me any more, or be too confused by me.

I mean, I could fairly reasonably pass for an above average medium sized woman some days, flat chest and facial hair notwithstanding, which is nice and lucky I suppose, but I feel like I'd be imposing on the female gender, or something ridiculous squirreled deep away in my brain. I feel a lot of pressure to keep the male ""factory equipment"" under self control too, as well as other health/anxiety/trauma/abuse issues, so it's a little complicated to **theorise** about overall.

Friday night. It had been a really shitty day at the end of a really shitty two weeks of work. I was painting my toes, because reasons. (See previous posts) I was really feeling broken down, and she was watching me intently. And I just broke. Full open. Wreck.

Don't get me wrong, I've been dropping breadcrumbs for years about myself. (Yes, all those jokes about my inner child being a scared/angry 16 year old lesbian) Believe me it's been deliberate. I had been hoping she would dare to ask, because somehow that would have been so much easier.

But she supports me. We talked. Probably the most open conversation I have had in a year with her. She kinda sorta had realized.  I agreed I needed to go see a someone about this. I don't think it could have gone much better.

I thought after coming out I would feel so much better. I didn't sleep and had nightmares all that night.

I have never been scared of someone leaving. But believe me when she had to go walk the dogs. I was on the verge of crying.

Saturday we had a party to go to, where the one person I had previously come out to was. I got to talk to them. It was really helpful.

I had told the wife I had come out to someone, but I didn't feel comfortable telling her who. Because if they knew who, there could be conversations about me without me there, and I really don't want that right now, I'm 3 inches outside the closet door, and I'm still really scared.

Sunday was a whole day of MegaSuperHetero! (TM) manly things, like auto repairs since I gotta get to work. And I'm also good at those things. So I was really too beat up and tired to think about anything.

But today was a lot more laid-back clean house errands kind of day. The music was on, and I found myself dancing. I'm still worried. I'm still scared. My chest still hurts when I think about it too long. But from somewhere a little happiness creeped in, and I haven't felt that in years.

I'm not sure where I go from here. I have to find a therapist, to work on some gender issues, some ADHD, and a few other things, like smoking. But it's progress. 

I'm still here.

I'm somewhere between.
I'm cis.
I'm trans.
I'm pan.
I'm searching.

Anyway - onto the main question.

Do you sometimes feel that the area you live in is too conservative to express your identity and worry over bullying or genderqueerphobia?

My area is a fairly Acacia Avenue, sedan on the driveway type area, and although it's a good place to live in, it's a largely middle-aged or older demographic who reside there [some of whom vote Labour over Conservative]. Then again, where I live there is no real LGBT community as such.

Where are you from and how do you feel it is in general for expressing your identity and have you ever experienced really bad or horrifying genderqueerphobia? Do you ever feel that changing rooms are unaccommodating or have to resort to thrift stores [charity shops here in the United Kingdom] to look for clothing? [from what I've learnt online, thrift stores seem more accommodating in general]

Somewhere like San Francisco, Seattle or Toronto is mostly accommodating for LGBT people [using Wikivoyage as a source] but a more rural area may not be.

I would be interested to know your experiences on this and how you feel about things.

2017-05-30 16:53:30,6e8kdv,11,8,"Hey, recently out as genderqueer. **Started wearing tighter pants and women's underwear** because I like the look and feel.

I feel silly sharing this, but it does seem fairly important, and maybe too touchy of a thing to bring up to a medical professional in person:

**My balls kinda ache** since I made these changes to my wardrobe. I'm 30, and I'd like to have kids in the next couple of years, so I don't want to mess with my sperm count. I want to make sure I'm not doing damage down there.

A quick Google search returns tons of results along the lines of ""compression underwear and skinny jeans can cause testicular injury, lower sperm count in men."" These articles recommend loose pants and ""going commando,"" neither of which I'm really into. It's not clear to me whether this is junk pop medical advice or a red flag I should pay attention to.

**For those with experience in this area, how serious of an issue is this?** I've already taken to wearing loose sweatpants (commando) to bed, and having alternating days where I wear boxers. Also decided I might as well go commando when I exercise.

But . . . I guess it's just a blow to my spirit to have bought a bunch of clothes I like only to find that I can't wear them as often as I'd like to because of the limitations of my anatomy.

2017-05-31 11:40:06,6eedvi,6,21,"I came here a few months ago and made a big long rant about how I just couldn't figure out my gender. I was freaking out, wondering what was wrong with me. 

A lot of that is there still. I'm still questioning, still unsure, still scared. A couple people I think had asked essentially what the big deal was. And I realize I have this compulsive need to label myself, to put a name to what I'm feeling. Not because society insists on putting a label on everything, but because I need a name for the way I'm feeling. I need language to describe to myself and others who and what I am as a person so that I can process this. 

Lately I've realized that for a long time I've been dysphoric about my feminine voice. That only made said dysphoria worse. ^^Yay.
I've also started preferring a more ""male"" name and male pronouns. 

Does that mean I'm trans-masculine? Who knows. Who knows? I still love feminine clothing, dresses, purses, sparkles, pretty matte lipstick. I always pictured myself as a boy who likes feminine things. That's not....confusing. Right? I can be AFAB, identify as a boy, and still want to rock a gorgeous dress and sparkly nail polish. Right? 

I'm comfortable in almost every other aspect of my body, but that may change. My biggest worry is that I'll come out to everybody as NewName^TM and as he/him and then, I'll want to go by OldName^TM and she/her. Though at the moment she/her makes me recoil just a little bit. 

Also, how exactly does one come out to family? My friends see me as me, a being capable of change and fluidity. My family however, has only known me as OldName^TM and she/her for the past 24 years. They don't understand non-binary like my friends do.

Anyway. I'm sure no one cares much about this but I enjoy reading other people's updates and it really helps me feel less alone. So I thought I'd share mine.
