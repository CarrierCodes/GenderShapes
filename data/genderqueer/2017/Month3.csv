2017-03-01 06:32:04,5wts79,2,4,"Hi all, 

Longtime lurker here to finally make a post. Let me tell you a bit about myself first to put things into context. I'm 22 and afab. I have hated many things about being female since puberty and hating my body resulted in a lot of dark thoughts/low self esteem/etc. during high school. I didn't realize until I was around 18 or 19 that other people shared my feelings in regard to their breasts and that many people received top surgery. I also didn't know much about what being transgender was growing up (as I am sure many of you can agree that it was not nearly as talked about as it is now). Once I learned about the term genderqueer, the pieces started to fit into place. I've thought of myself as such for about four years now.
Fast forward to the present and my question: I am tired of feeling closeted. I already know that I like how I look when presenting in a more traditionally ""masculine"" fashion. And I want to come out as such. I want to ask people to see me as a boy sometimes (address me as he/him if they desire). I want to, at the very least, resolve some of my own conflict about my gender (or lack thereof, etc.) and I am the only person stopping myself from getting help with this. But I hear that some therapists disagree with the idea of genderqueer identities. I don't want to walk in and find myself labelled as another ""transtrender"". I actually worry a lot about being seen as someone who is ""making it all up"" to people who don't understand, but I really just want to live a life free of a label that doesn't accurately define me and that makes me miserable (female). If anyone has had a positive experience, I would be so grateful for anything you're willing to share!

One last thing- I would like to try to find a therapist who will talk with me about my options for top surgery (approval needed for health insurance). I hear this is more difficult for genderqueer folks so if you have specific knowledge of this situation please let me know! I do not want to go on T so this may further harm my chances of getting the surgery.

2017-03-01 16:07:20,5wwtgf,1,6,"Hi there. Long time supporter of genderqueer/trans/fluid identities, first time thinking about it in relationship to my own identity. I've been through a lot of stuff recently (abuser dying, no longer living in fear of hacking/exposing/online shaming, finally acknowledging my own history of rape/abuse, and realizing my negative feelings towards men may be more than just hatred of patriarchy.)

I am still trying to unravel it all, because I think I see a lot of gender backwards. My perception of masculinity is more centered around overcompensated shows of strength, arrogance, socially reinforced weakness/superficial intelligence, and rigid conformity to a norm, whereas my perception of femininity is real strength, perseverance, high levels of intelligence, empathy, compassion, and solidarity. I mean, I know it's my perception. And there are awesome men. But it's how I feel when I'm identified as male?

Anyhoo... I wrote some notes and would welcome feedback on what my next steps could be in my gender exploration! 

What I Want:
I don't want people to respect my masculinity.
I don't really want to care about what other people think. Perhaps more importantly, I want people to SEE that I don't care what they think.
I want to feel free.
I want to feel and dress creatively.
I want to be colorful.
I want to be comfortable.
I want to feel sexy.
I want to show off parts of my body that make me feel sexy. My calves, thighs, butt, breasts, upper back, feet.
I don't really want to explain myself. Unless I do!
I want help exploring.
I don't want to be ashamed.
I want to feel powerful.
I don't want to be grouped with men.
I don't want to feel alone.
I want to feel strong but soft.
I want to feel pretty but not dainty.
I don't really want to feel obligated to dress a certain way, male or female.
Sometimes I want to hide.
I want to take advantage of my feminine features (lips, eyebrows, calves, thighs).
I want to feel like I'm part of a community.

What I Don't Know:
If I ever want to be gendered as a woman.
If I ever want to wear dresses.
If I ever want to take estrogen.
I don't know if I ever want to wear a bra.
How I would want my kids to address me.
If I would want to have sex with straight men.
How I want my dynamic with my wife to change, if at all.
I don't know if I want to wear heels.

2017-03-02 07:01:38,5x1ti2,34,38,"So.

I identified as agender for years and years before accepting I'm trans. I finally came out to myself three and a half years ago. I came out and went by a femme name, but it didn't feel right, so I chose a neutral one that could be short for either a common female or male one. But I got on hormones as soon as I could afford it, lasered my face, changed my legal name (to the female version of what I go by). I basically refuse to wear makeup, though, because effing yuck. I rarely get gendered female by strangers, but when I do, or when someone seems unsure, I'm happy.

I tell people: they *and* she for pronouns; neutral name *and* femme name. (Actually, I went by neutral name *only* for well over a year before telling anyone the femme version was also my name.)

I've never called myself a trans woman. I say I'm a trans feminine person.

But lately... I've noticed some things.

I got a letter from someone addressed to ""Ms. Femme Name.""  It felt *so. good.* And I thought, this is so much nicer than ""Mx. Neutral Name.""

One day I was out, dressed super andro, got ""Miss"" from a stranger, and I was like, *heart skips a beat.*

There's been some bedroomy stuff, but I won't get into the deets.

Here was the kicker. An older friend of mine recently referred to me, in a very offhand way, as ""basically my daughter.""

I've been out to my folks over three years. My dad, who I love very much, was kinda hard on me growing up and even in my adulthood. He hasn't really said much about me being trans, but he showed he accepted me by being less hard on me, and he's the fist person in my life to call me ""Femme Name"" regularly. But he doesn't call me daughter.

My mom is weird about it. Not hurtful exactly, just clearly uncomfortable. She doesn't call me daughter either. 

So when my friend said that... it's literally the first time I heard someone refer to me as a ""daughter.""

I don't want to be called a child. I like being called daughter. I don't want to be a sibling. My brother calls me sister, and I like it. I've felt weird about it because I was unsure for a long time, but I like it. 

I think I'm just a trans woman who happens to prefer andro styles and hates the fuck out of makeup. Seriously, fuck that shit. (But just watch. Maybe soon I'll be drowning in eyeliner and lippy things.)

But I want to say: thank you to the folks of this sub. /r/MtF is so saturated with ultra femme messaging. Wonderful people, but as a group it just feels so focused on following the script. So focused on ""transition."" I've never once on /r/genderqueer read a thread where  someone gets ganged up on for their eyebrows. I long for a world where that tired old trope weren't so very real.

What I've learned from this sub is that what I've been doing isn't transition: it's transcendence. So here's me, putting aside my own preconceived notions of gender. Here's me, overcoming my fears. Maybe once I've lived with it awhile, the label won't matter so much to me. But for now, I'm claiming it.

I'm andro and maybe a little masculine sometimes. I like spitting and swearing and scotch (neat, please). I like plaid, will not get my ears pierced or wear any more jewelry than a necklace, and wearing a dress will never ever keep me out of the woods or the mud. I like my nails trimmed short (but oh gosh yes with polish) and my footwear practical.

I'm new to this subreddit, to reddit in general, and to accepting my identity as somewhere outside of cis and binary trans. I'm learning a lot from some folks with gender identities that are very different from what I'm used to. But I wouldn't be here if I didn't have one of those more poorly understood identities.

Right now the two words I'm using to reflect my gender identity are non-binary and genderqueer. There may also be a certain degree of fluidity in my gender.

Luckily I have a really supportive network of people that I've started coming out to. I'm most nervous to come out to my parents. I have come out to them before as bisexual (a term I no longer use due to the prefix) and while it was weird and awkward, ultimately it was okay. And the 2 family members I confided in say that this will be no different. But it is scary.

I'm not sure what I'm looking for in writing this post. I guess if anyone has tips and tricks for someone who is just figuring all of this out, that would be helpful.

2017-03-05 15:42:46,5xnchc,9,15,"For background, I am 36, AMAB, nonbinary, primarily attracted to women, and single.  I am not on any kind of hormones and do not intend to be, so my body is unambiguously male and will stay that way, but I also don't have a very ""manly"" body type.  I'm healthy but have a small frame and not a lot of muscle, I look very young, and I have soft skin.  Over the past couple years I became really comfortable with the outward aspects of gender, dressing the way I want, and I love the way I look now, and feel comfortable expressing myself the way I want most of the time.  I have about shoulder-length hair, sometimes wear dresses or skirts, often wear all ""men's"" clothes, often mix it up, especially with casual clothing from the women's section.  I'd describe how I dress as casual and fun, and I'm trying to look ""soft"" and ""cute"" rather than ""edgy"" or ""sexy"".

Social things outside of dating feel pretty comfy to me.  Even before I was ""out"" about being nonbinary, and dressed in all men's clothing, I had been pretty comfortable navigating mostly-female settings, which has been important to me because I've always related better to women and wanted to be ""one of the girls"".  When it comes to friendship and being included in social activities, I feel like I interact with women pretty naturally, and have for a long time.

And when I've been in serious relationships, or already involved with people romantically or sexually, I also have been pretty comfortable with the gender dynamic.  I haven't had any big gender-related problems here...these people have usually been really understanding and supportive.

But I still have a huge problem:

Navigating those early stages of dating and relationships though, has remained one of the most challenging, frustrating, and sometimes toxic aspects of my life.  It's the one aspect of my life where I feel like, for all purposes, I am treated and perceived fully ""as a guy"" by most people -- including ways that feel very bad and wrong.  Some of the examples:

* I feel like 95%+ of the expectation for initiating things is placed on me.  I am very rarely asked out or have people initiate any sort of dating or relationship with me.
* I feel a strong asymmetry in most of the social relationships I have with women that I feel attracted to, in which I am trying to test out the waters of whether or not I could become closer to them, or communicate that I like them and am open to becoming closer to them.  I experience a lot of dropped conversations, and people frequently cancel dates with me last-minute.  A lot of these women fall out of my life unless I continually put in effort to reach out to them.
* Some of the things women have said and done to me, suggest that I am still sometimes being perceived as ""threatening"" the way a lot of men are.  There have been a couple of women I've met in person through social events, who conspicuously avoid me.  I find this super frustrating and confusing because none of these women have explained to me anything I did that crossed a boundary, and I am and always have been 100% committed to respecting any personal boundaries people assert, so it's a ""black box"" for me and it's also like, untrue, like if people are perceiving me as threatening, I'm not, like, if someone ever tells me to leave them alone or stop giving them a certain type of attention, I'll respect that unconditionally and I will not react negatively to them doing that.

It's really puzzling to me because these things seem glaringly in conflict with what I experience in the rest of my life, which is that women tell me repeatedly that they feel really comfortable and safe around me, that I am a very nonthreatening person, that they feel comfortable talking with me about things that they only feel comfortable talking with women about, that I'm ""basically one of the girls"" or ""an honorary girl"" or things like that.

The internet is full of ""dating advice"" but it's almost all oriented toward men and women.  A lot of the advice directed at men is directing me to portray myself as a person I am not (I feel like I'm a pretty confident person on a deep level, but I often like to display confidence through emotional vulnerability) but the advice directed at women who date women is also of limited use to me (some of it is useful) because it doesn't provide anything about how to navigate or respond to being viewed or treated ""like a man"".  I don't want to ""be the man"" in the relationship.  I want to date someone who is comfortable dating a male-bodied person and chucking the gender roles and norms out the window and explicitly renegotiating those roles based on our personalities and values.

It also feels most natural to me to date through my existing friend group.  I would rather date someone I know, with whom I have mutual friends, because I don't feel fully comfortable with someone until I see them interact with other people.  I also tend to feel like attraction dovetails with friendship with me.  I tend to feel attracted to my friends and I tend to want to have a closer friendship with people I feel more attracted to.

The problem is there is something coming out in these dynamics that is somehow becoming jarring or bad.  I'm not able to pinpoint it...maybe something that I'm doing that is tapping into bad patterns of behavior associated with maleness?  I don't know.

It's puzzling too though because another thing numerous women have told me is that they have trouble reading when I'm attracted to women (and many people who don't know me at all even question whether I'm attracted to women at all) because they say my behavior comes across as very friendly and I don't do many things that seem to unambiguously express attraction.

I'm really struggling to express my sexuality and my attraction to and interest in people, in ways that they feel comfortable with and that lead to the results that I want.  I am wanting to examine my behavior and figure out how I can change it to lead to the results I want.  I also am struggling with feeling intense shame associated with my sexuality and feelings of attraction.  Like, for me, my sexuality is a source of love and warmth and gratitude and positive energy towards the people I feel attracted to.  And I find it really frustrating and invalidating when all those positive things are interpreted negatively by others.

T has worked very well rather fast and I\'m on a looow dose. \n\nidk what to do. i do fear for safety if i was non passing in such an aggressive bro-y environment but its also unexpectedly dysphoria inducing to be read as and expected to be a cis male.  \nEven people who know I\'m afab and use she/her still talk to me like I\'m cis... hell i got texted memey nsfw at work by a coworker bc it wasnt being sent over the company email .... sooooo uh. weird ideas of acceptance from cis men idk my work culture is very crude. \n\ni kinda feel like i shouldnt bitch I\'m a white afab transmasc receiving positive to ambivalent acceptance and all but. \n\ni don\'t want to detransition at all. i don\'t want to revert or stop physical changes. Its all social\n\n..i never thought being read male would be so dysphoria inducing.

So I've been figuring out this concept of gender queerness for some time now and I still have a long way to go, but almost right away I found the idea that Androgyne (as I understood it to be gender neutral) was so masculine.

But I have come to learn from my therapist that some people take the ""Andro"" (greek for male) seriously and place Androgyny on the masculine side of the non binary spectrum.

I like Femme stuff, not because it's femme but because I enjoy looking beautiful. Though it could be my creative side, which is divine Femme as I understand it.

So Andro being male, Gyno being the Greek for female, I did a quick search for Gynogyne and it came up with what looks like german papers on the subject?

I am not sure if I like Gynogyne to describe myself, but I definitely don't dislike it. But I really am to Femme to call myself Androgyne if it really is masculine neutral.

I'm AFAB nonbinary, and though I know that they're understanding/loving/will support me always, it's scary. I also don't know if they're educated on genderqueerness...

- Finally... Self-acceptance. Any advice on any sort of practice/mindset that you have used in coming to terms with yourself and your identity would be greatly appreciated.

Also i'd like to figure out if this is enough to donate, since that's been something on my mind the entire time, if i wanted an excuse to cut it.

Second, next steps. For a while i've wanted to figure out what it would take to start hormones, or facial hair removal, or what other steps are out there i haven't considered. I think what i really want is a local community i could tap into (i'm around Dallas) that could point out specific places i could go. I've met several cool queer people online, but without in-person moral support (i've hesitated bringing it up to offline friends ""before i had anything to show for it"") i've just done nothing for it.

I got some womens tshirts and shorts for the summer (wow they are WAY shorter than mens, probably won't shave my legs because its such a hassle). So far the leggings, short shorts could at least be excused away as slightly feminine exercise clothes as I see athletic guys sometimes wearing them. I also got a pair of unisex converse (converse shoes seem pretty unisex in general) and some women's socks but they are only slightly feminine IMO, solid white or black with some colorful stripes. I actually tried on some flats in a store, it wasn't crowded but it wasn't empty, hopefully nobody cared. I really wanted to try on some strappy sandals but I was too afraid. I have tried womens underwear before but just not a good fit for my junk. But I got a pair of flyless micro briefs and some trunks, they remind me of womens underwear.

I like my beard but sometimes I want to just shave it all off and try on a skirt, pantyhose and a pair of flats. But my family is conservative, they already dislike the fact that I wear leggings now. They haven't even seen me in the shorts shorts yet. I can't imagine them being happy about that. also I never want to shave my beard ever again! I love it too much! When I go outside people do give me looks, but I can't tell if its my hair, or beard or pants that is drawing their attention. Right now I like my viking look, but sometimes I want to look like all those gorgeous women I see in the street. My interest in women's clothes is definitely sexual though. For some reason in my mind, to be feminine is to be beautiful and sexy. I wish I could somehow be able to switch between appearances from slightly feminine looking male and feminine looking female. Just somehow would not feel right if I wore skirts and heels while rocking a beard. Also I have fragile emotions so I definitely would not be able to cope with the harassment and criticism.

edit: welp I got these sandals

2017-03-14 22:39:32,5zfi3p,2,4,"Hey gang! I had a great weekend this weekend and I had a shitty weekend last weekend and I wanted to share these experiences with you. I'm AMAB and I'm genderqueer/genderfluid. My sex is male and I am very happy being male and I don't want to transition to female, however when I wake up in girl mode, I like to express it through the way I dress. Hair and makeup is too much for me but I love doing my nails. I'm also an albino and I am blind.

It started last Thursday when I went to see my doctor. You see I'm on this huge mission to improve myself both mentally and physically so I thought I'd get started by losing weight and getting my diet right so I can start working out at the gym in a few months. I've got a few other steps to take before I get to that point. Anyways, I've been weighing myself at a friend's house because he has a digital scale and I can easily read the numbers. I replaced the batteries to ensure I'd get accurate readings. When they weighed me at the doctor's office, they were telling me I was about 8 pounds heavier than I thought I was. The scale at home told me I was 166 and the doctor's scale was telling me 174. I asked the nurse if I could pull the scale into the exam room so I could weigh myself like I do over there and he said sure. (BTW: the nurse is really cute and I have a hard time resisting the urge to hit on him!) I stripped off my clothes and stepped up on the scale and fiddled with the weights until I got it balanced. 172 was the magic number. This made me feel sad because I was so thrilled to be below 170. I know it's only a couple pounds but I've been working really hard at eating the best I can and staying away from sweet treats (I feel bad, I get an apple juice and a peanut butter egg). Finding this out pretty much let the air out of my tires.

Fast forward to the next day and I get on the bus and see my favorite bus driver. I tell her what happened at the doctor's office and I told her that I feel fat and sad today. She started laughing hysterically and I couldn't figure out why and it was starting to irritate me a little bit when she calmed down somewhat and told me that I'm having PMS! I was like ""Whaaaaaat?!?!?"" She said all the symptoms I described are about how she feels when her Aunt Flo comes to visit once a month. I started giggling and told her that I'm so much like a woman! It made me feel a little bit better but all weekend long it kinda nagged at me and I didn't start feeling better until about Tuesday of this week. On Saturday I did do something fun for myself in an effort to cheer me up a little bit. I had gotten some 8 guage circular barbells a few weeks ago and I stopped by a piercing shop to get them put back in my ears. It's been a loooooong time since I've worn earrings and since I can't see my own face in the mirror (it's like looking at a face of a mannequin) and the holes needed to be stretched a little bit, instead of ripping my ears off I opted to let a professional do it. After it was done, I was out and about running some other errands and I could feel the weight of them in my ears again and it started to put a smile on my face. Tuesday when I woke up and felt them, I was really happy I did it and it's encouraging me to get more piercings.

Fast forward a little further to Saturday night. I was on telegram with some friends and we started talking about doing nails and whatnot. We started making tentative plans to meet at a friend's place the next day but we never hammered out a time before I fell asleep. I woke up the next morning and we all started talking about it again and we nailed down a time to meet. I was about 20 minutes late getting there but I had such an awesome time! It was me and three other friends of mine, one girl, one guy, and one person. We spent the better part of the afternoon just gossiping, hanging out, smoking cannabis, drinking mimosas, and doing our nails. My guy friend didn't do his nails because he's an airplane mechanic and his nails would be destroyed the next time he went to work. He's also a little self conscious about it because he just recently started this job and he loves it. Later that evening I got hungry and walked down the street to Little Caesar's Pizza and came back with a bunch of pizzas for everyone. I also wanted to show off my new nails too! :) It's been awhile since I've seen these guys because I've been on a sabbatical of self improvement and I'm getting comfortable enough to start sticking my head out from under the rock I'm hiding at to start seeing people on a small basis. I really wanted to wait until I had the whole package (mind, body, and spirit) before I popped up again, but a lot of these people are like family to me and I've been missing my family as of lately. We're all going to a convention at the end of July and I so can't wait to go and see the rest of my family and make some new friends.

So that's it. I just wanted to share with you guys because I'm having such a blast being my true self and I hope this experience will give y'all the courage to start being the people you want to be. Y'all do me a favor and have an awesome day!

Take care!

2017-03-15 01:43:59,5zgj4g,4,4,"Hello! I’m AMAB, 22, gay, and have always identified as male, but I’ve begun to question my gender identity recently. I’ve never felt comfortable in all-male environments. I get very anxious and feel unsafe in male restrooms; almost as if I’m expecting to be attacked. Every time I’ve had to be in a male dorm, like on sleepaway trips at school or summer camps when I was younger, I clammed up completely, had no interest in socializing at all, and would just have a general sense of dread and not-belonging. Any activities the boys would do to establish camaraderie among themselves would repulse me, and I wanted no part in them. I never spoke unless I was spoken to, and even then I would make myself as brief and scarce as possible for self-preservation. Conversely, when I was around girls, I would open up significantly, making jokes and being very social (by my standards at least). 

I always thought I felt this way around men because of my sexuality, but there were other gay men around at those times, and they did not seem nearly as averse to socializing with other men as me.
This discomfort has definitely bled into my more recent life too, I was the only male employee at my job for about a year and never felt an ounce of discomfort about it. I in fact prefer there being no other men. I still find it very difficult to have conversations with most men I meet; I either get super nervous if they’re gay/effeminate/attractive (fearing they won’t like me back) or super uncomfortable if they’re straight. Either way I tend to say little to nothing at all to other guys irl.

There’s also my complicated relationship with my hair. It was very long from about age 12-15, essentially because I refused to go to the barber (again, only men there). Then I cut it off, which made me feel sexier, but in a more conventional way I guess? But I always kind of liked it long more, so I grew it out again. It’s more “me”. Now my hair almost reaches my belly button, and I’ve recently had the strong urge to style it in very feminine ways.
I also have become VERY dissatisfied with my frumpy masculine wardrobe, and want to experiment with more feminine clothing and accessories. I hate wearing suits and ties. I find them so boring and they make me blend in with the other men which I REALLY dislike.

I dreaded learning how to shave when I started getting facial hair because I saw that as too masculine an activity. I still hate the act of shaving but I now like my beard, and my body hair in general (I’m very hairy).

I currently present very masc (most people can’t tell I’m gay unless I tell them) but if people were to refer to me as she/her, that would not bother me at all. A waiter gendered me as female recently (he only saw me from behind) and it annoyed me at first but the more I thought about it the more I liked it. I don’t know if she/her fits me more than he/him, but I’m fine with either atm. I also am uncomfortable with people referring to me as a “man”. “Gay man” and “male” are fine, but “man” by itself really irks me. There are just so many associations with that word that I don’t identify with.

I recently searched some feminine names for myself and fell in love with two. Like, they really excited me to a level I wasn’t expecting.

Anyway, I’m mainly posting here to share my story and get some help finding a label for myself. If anyone else here can relate to any of this, or give me some suggestions for labels I’d appreciate it :) I know they aren’t necessary but I personally would like to find one that fits.

I’m AMAB, 22, gay, and have always identified as male, but I’ve begun to question my gender identity recently. I’ve never felt comfortable in all-male environments. I get very anxious and feel unsafe in male restrooms; almost as if I’m expecting to be attacked. Every time I’ve had to be in a male dorm, like on sleepaway trips at school or summer camps when I was younger, I clammed up completely, had no interest in socializing at all, and would just have a general sense of dread and not-belonging. Any activities the boys would do to establish camaraderie among themselves would repulse me, and I wanted no part in them. I never spoke unless I was spoken to, and even then I would make myself as brief and scarce as possible for self-preservation. Conversely, when I was around girls, I would open up significantly, making jokes and being very social (by my standards at least). \n\nI always thought I felt this way around men because of my sexuality, but there were other gay men around at those times, and they did not seem nearly as averse to socializing with other men as me.\nThis discomfort has definitely bled into my more recent life too, I was the only male employee at my job for about a year and never felt an ounce of discomfort about it. I in fact prefer there being no other men. I still find it very difficult to have conversations with most men I meet; I either get super nervous if they’re gay/effeminate/attractive (fearing they won’t like me back) or super uncomfortable if they’re straight.

To start, I don't identify as male, but I don't feel comfortable identifying as female either (yes, I'm genderqueer/genderfluid). I occasionally switch but for the most part I'm content to consider myself as containing both genders simultaneously. It's a complicated feeling and I still don't entirely understand it, but I'm coming to accept it, and slowly learning how to express it so that other people might begin to understand. Generally, I look like a feminine man wearing women's clothes. Although I more identify as a masculine woman wearing woman's clothes, I feel like I more or less make my point.

Not everything has been perfect since I came out. I went out during the daylight hours this last weekend and I was met with my fair share of stares. I live in Tampa, which isn't exactly a bastion of progressivism (even on the St. Pete side of the bridge, where I was, even though it's generally better there). There were even some guys on the street who approached my girlfriend and I who were borderline hostile. My family doesn't accept me or my ""alternative lifestyle"", and I still haven't been able to bring myself to come out on facebook or to people at work who aren't sympathetic or accepting. Nevertheless! I wouldn't take it back for anything. Not for a moment.

This weekend I participated in an alternative fashion show and not everybody there was 100% on board with me or what I was doing or how I looked but by the end of the night, everybody was at least willing to accept me for what I am, and they gave so much love. I keep looking at the pictures. I can't stop. I'm still having a hard time believing it's actually real. That I'm really doing what I'm doing. Yet here I am. There is photographic proof, and I couldn't be happier about it.

I couldn't even imagine this would be my life a year ago. Not in my wildest dreams. I am out. So out. I've dreamed of this, flirted with it, pretended that it wasn't what I wanted, done literally everything except actually coming out of the closet for 27 years. Wow. Yet here I am. I feel beautiful. I feel like, you know when you find the last corner in a particularly large jigsaw puzzle? Something like that. The puzzle isn't totally put together but there is hope! For the first time in my life I genuinely feel like there is hope for me to be actually, genuinely happy.

I've found acceptance in places I could have never dreamed. All because I finally put on a dress and stepped outside. I went outside! I faced the world! And for the most part the world greeted me with a giant hug! I never, never, believed for a moment this was possible.

I have an amazingly accepting girlfriend and I know that I'm lucky. So lucky. It's scary and exciting especially because I've been down this road before and felt this love before and been betrayed by the allies who said they supported me. Discovering that the people who claimed to accept you were mocking you behind your back is painful in a way I'm sure you can imagine. I was so scared of that happening again that I hid for almost a decade. 

Maybe you've been there before, maybe not. All I can say now is don't give those people any purchase in your life or happiness or self acceptance. You are who you are. You are beautiful the way you are. Be happy. It's worth it. Yes, even with all the love around me I have to remind myself sometimes, but it's still worth it!

As queer humans, despite politics, despite hate, despite everything, or maybe even because of it, this is our time. Do not hide! There is no time or use for shame or self doubt. Let's show the world that we are here and we will not be silent. Let's show the world that there is another way, that life isn't binary, neither are we, and we will not submit to a life with arbitrary walls. 

I love each and every one of you, genuinely, and hope with all of my heart that this brings you strength and happiness and positivity.

TL;DR Life is complicated but good! Be happy! &lt;3

2017-03-24 02:51:20,616k9d,1,8,"My name is Jake, I am a Pisces (if you can't tell lol).  I just turned 28 recently, AMAB, I'm big into music and video games.  I'm engaged, with two young boys. I'm also big into metaphysics and new age stuff. I'm not religious, but I am spiritual.

I've decided to create this account to post here after lurking for week.  I believe I am genderfluid and am hoping (in part) to receive some validation because I do not know any genderfluid people in my life, although I have a friend who is intersexed (I think that's the right term? I'm new to all of this) who has been extremely helpful through this all.

I started questioning about last Thursday and started researching shortly after that. From everything I could find, the term that sit best with me was Genderfluid.  I came out to my best friend who I have known for 15+ years and the first words out of his mouth were ""That doesn't surprise me. At all."" So yeah, I was shocked more than he was lol

We talked in depth, and I told him my fiance didn't know yet and that I wanted to experiment a little with clothing and whatnot to see how it made me feel.  The next night I dressed up after shaving my beard and modeled a few outfits and took pictures (that I might be inclined to share, if you guys want to see them).  I decided I liked it.  I felt good.  I felt sexy, and feminine.  

The next day (or two? everything is a blur) I suffered from extreme anxiety.  Anxiety so bad that it hurt me, mostly my chest, hips and butt.  I was walking around in near constant pain, and I can only assume this was a form of dysphoria.  The only thing that seemed to help was dressing up. I also had a moment where I saw a super cute girl in a restaurant who looked like she literally could have been female me and I had a panic attack and had to leave the room because I was freaking out and thinking I could never look cute like her.

Well, my fiance ended up outing me before I was ready to face her (which ended up being great timing because who knows when I would have said something, I was worried.)  Basically, she was very accepting, although she is having a little trouble adjusting.  She bought me an adorable R2D2 nightie for my birthday (which after coming out I told her was what I had my eye on), and surprised me with a cute top yesterday when she came home.

After coming out to my fiance, I felt like I had been missing a part of me and didn't even know it was gone until I found it again.  I was excited to call myself genderfluid. I thought it was awesome!  I was happier than I had been in a long while, and wanted all the cute clothes.  I was going to visit stores just to look at cute clothes, I was thinking about piercing my ears, and I was feeling a compulsive urge to shave my legs. I was seeing synchronicities everywhere, too.

Then I had a moment yesterday, where (as I described it to my fiance) I have a gender slider, and it usually sits at like 75% female and ebbs and flows around there. This basically had my slider at 50% and swinging erratically and wildly from center to either side, and it short circuited and caused me to ""shut down"". I had to hide under the blanket until I rebooted because I didn't want to see my body. I was full blown panic attack and couldn't do anything but curl up in a ball.  I eventually calmed down, but my whole body was sore and I was exhausted.

Then today I've just felt crummy.  I've just kind of been ""here"". Today has kind of been a garbage day.  Just one thing after another of crap (but no anxiety today, so I guess that's good), eventually ending with me very depressed and on the verge of tears.  We live with my mother due to financial issues and she just returned from vacation very early this morning (she had been gone the entire time the questioning/etc had been going on, and her being back might have to do with my crappy day) so I was worried about dressing, but by the time I got home I said screw it and put on my R2D2 nightie and a comfy pair of panties and I slowly started feeling better and that leads to here.

So yeah, that's my story so far.  I'm considering starting a blog just because I think it'd be cool to chronicle this journey (I didn't when I started down my spiritual path, and I somewhat regret it)

So anyway.  It's nice to meet everyone, and I'm excited to be here.  I know I asked for validation, but typing this all out pretty much validated it for me (funny how that works), but it was nice to share it with everyone.

I do have a lot of questions as well, but it'd probably be better to start individual topics for those.

I had to hide under the blanket until I rebooted because I didn\'t want to see my body. I was full blown panic attack and couldn\'t do anything but curl up in a ball.  I eventually calmed down, but my whole body was sore and I was exhausted.\n\nThen today I\'ve just felt crummy.  I\'ve just kind of been ""here"". Today has kind of been a garbage day.  Just one thing after another of crap (but no anxiety today, so I guess that\'s good), eventually ending with me very depressed and on the verge of tears.  We live with my mother due to financial issues and she just returned from vacation very early this morning (she had been gone the entire time the questioning/etc had been going on, and her being back might have to do with my crappy day) so I was worried about dressing, but by the time I got home I said screw it and put on my R2D2 nightie and a comfy pair of panties and I slowly started feeling better and that leads to here.\n\nSo yeah, that\'s my story so far.  I\'m considering starting a blog just because I think it\'d be cool to chronicle this journey (I didn\'t when I started down my spiritual path, and I somewhat regret it)\n\nSo anyway.  It\'s nice to meet everyone, and I\'m excited to be here.  I know I asked for validation, but typing this all out pretty much validated it for me (funny how that works), but it was nice to share it with everyone.\n\nI do have a lot of questions as well, but it\'d probably be better to start individual topics for those.\n\nANYWAY, I feel like I\'m rambling, so yeah.

2017-03-26 16:45:09,61mhxs,0,16,"Dear: Strangers from last night

What's a girl to do all alone and not wanting to go home?
Just wander the street until the sense of loneliness just crushes her and she breaks down in the middle of the

street.


You spotted me crying my eyes out or more accurate my wailing sounds. You asked if I was okay I could of lied said yes; but I shook my head.

 You asked me if I just wanted to walk with you. I was hesitant really,but I followed along.
You and you're friend stood outside the pizza place asking all sorts 
of questions. 


If I was okay and what was wrong etc. I didn't really open up just enough of to say that ""I was feeling trapped in my own life"" 


And, they said that coming out was hard and just all my general anxiety , fears etc would pass and that I would be okay and I was worth it etc.


Anyway I was awkward and felt bad that I was holding them up. They reassured me that they were fine. One of them handed me their business card and at that point I was just going to head off to 

wander again. 

But, what I ended up doing was following them through invitation to the gay bar they were hanging out at. 


Once I got there they introduced me to some other friends of theirs. The lady insisted I should have some of the pizza they bought and the man wanted to buy me a drink. Initially I heisted, but I just ended up shrugging my shoulders and saying okay.




Anyway it was a pretty good time. I engaged with some causal conversation with these strangers that were nicer than they had any right to be.


At one point I was chatting with the one lady that had invited me along and she again reassured me that ""I was going to look great"" and that her sister in law had transitioned. She asked me if I could see it I shaked my head no not really. She responded that I was going to great you may not feel it but you see just a glimmer of it don't you she asked? I said yes. 


She was just overall positive telling me I was worth it and everything was going to work out. 
Also just the fact that she was a fan my style. 


Later she left and I decided it was time for me to get going as well. We walked for a couple of blocks. 

She hugged me and I told her I felt better. She said if I needed to talk I should get in contact with her friend who has given me his business card earlier. Anyway she was off and so was I. 




But, to the kind strangers last night you probably won't read this, but thank you. 

I did email the one that gave me his business card a nice thank you. But, I just wanted to get off my chest to share the story of the kindness of strangers. I probably won't ever see them again, but I won't forget them and their kindness. 


They didn't really have to do what they did, but they did it. So, thanks for the drinks,pizza and most importantly the kindness.

2017-03-26 20:24:23,61nq90,7,21,"Hi folks,

I've probably posted here a few time but just wanted to get a few things off my chest. I've been questioning my gender identity for about 6 months now. I've been through a lot of labels (both binary and non-binary identities) but have settled in some kind of genderqueer nonbinary realm.

I feel that I am gender neutral, which is something I've thought a lot about. I'm uncomfortable with my chest so do plan on wearing binders in future. I have a chosen gender neutral name that I prefer, and I don't like being called feminine pronouns (I'm AFAB). I feel less uncomfortable with masculine ones but gender neutral pronouns (like they/them or ze/hir) would make me so much happier. I also have tried packing (I'm still really on the fence about this). Basically I'm making a lot of changes in my gender expression to find what's more comfortable. 

I do have pre-existing mental health conditions such as social anxiety, something I've factored in to my discovery process. Basically at the moment, it just feels like *everything* is so gendered. I don't like being referred to as female, perceived as a woman. Yet I think womanhood is amazing and a supportive community. It's really confusing.

I've been doing a lot of research and over the course of this time, I have read so much negativity and hate towards the nonbinary/genderqueer community. So much so I think that I've internalised a lot of this. 

I'm trying to just stick with an identity something people would understand, that I'm just a gender nonconforming woman. But I feel like that's dishonest. I don't know what my discomfort with gendered language (such as woman, girl, lady, miss etc) stems from but it feels a lot like social dysphoria. 

I feel a lot of guilt if I choose to transition socially and legally because I would potentially change my name and pronouns, both would be hard work and I feel like people would think I've spent too much time on Tumblr, I'm just going through a phase (I'm 23 years old) or that I just want to be different. When in truth, I wish I could be more comfortable as things are, or at least have my gender identity respected without the fuss. Just carry on as normal.

I'm just wondering if anyone else experiences anything similar, not wanting to make changes as it would be problematic or wondering if they're just gender nonconforming cis people in denial for some reason!",genderqueer,"Dealing with a lot of guilt and confusion, as I assume most people do",1490585063.0,"{'created_utc': 1490559863, 'id': '61nq90', 'num_comments': 7, 'score': 21, 'selftext': ""Hi folks,\n\nI've probably posted here a few time but just wanted to get a few things off my chest.

I'm almost 30, I've identified as female my entire life. A little over a year ago my spouse came out as trans. At first I was in shock, then supportive. But I'm sitting here in the wake of her transition and privately, I'm feeling some things that are uncomfortable. I'm not sure how much my mind is just on these things because of her transition? I don't really want to bring it up to her and ""steal her thunder."" This is her time to explore who she is, and I want to be there as a stable support. 

I'm just starting to wonder, I've never felt entirely right in my body. I've always felt too big, too tall (over 6' female) and like all the things I love didn't fit into who I should be. I think if it was just that alone, I'd probably just write it all off. But I've also felt a deep seated loathing for my chest ever since I started to have one.

2017-03-31 21:33:31,62ob81,2,9,"So as you can probably guess from the title, I'm genderqueer, but in many senses, I'm still trying to come to terms with it for a variety of reasons I'd like to just get out there if you don't mind.

So for the longest time, I've identified as a cisman. In a lot of ways, I still do, and I feel comfortable with that and don't feel any sense of regret or otherwise dysphoria for doing so in my 23 years of life. At the same time, I've started to understand the more feminine aspects of myself. If anything, this comes out more in my behavior: delicate sort of movements with my hands, chipper and outgoing attitudes towards others, tenderness, etc. Of course, just writing that, I sort of take issue with, because it's a fucking shame that behaviors that are traditionally coded female men can't explore and are often faced with violence and even killed for displaying any sort of femininity. 

At the same time, I have no real desire to even present myself as female or even present in feminine coded ways. I feel perfectly comfortable having a beard, having broad shoulders, wearing jeans and plaid because, well that's what I feel comfortable with. If anything, I only want to call myself genderqueer just so people don't mistake my experience with my body and gender with that of a cisman. But if it were my perfect world where people don't experience violence for the way they present themselves or for who they are, I wouldn't really call myself any gender besides the gender that only I occupy, which of course grows and moves where I grow and move. I don't feel like any gender really quite fits my actual experience with my identity and my relationship to the world, even genderqueer feels like a limiting sort of identification for me.

It really started to hit my yesterday when I was watching a documentary on Judith Butler who was talking about her gender experience and she said (and I'm heavily paraphrasing), ""Do I subscribe to everything the lesbian and gay movement says? Do I come out as a lesbian and gay person first before I identify as a woman, a Jew, a philosopher? No. It's not the only identity. So these are communities where one belongs and one does not belong."" and ""I've never felt at home in my gender. I'm sure other people have. To me gender is ambivalence."" In so many ways, that was really applicable to so many of my experiences as a biracial Mexican-American, as a someone who presents male, as a genderqueer person, as someone who is bisexual, etc. Nothing really quite fits and I don't really feel like any label and any label I've given myself doesn't fit. Even calling myself a nonman doesn't feel right. 
If anything, genderqueer seems to just be a decent catch-all term to at least contextualize something. 

I've had an unfortunate experience trying to talk about my gender stuff with someone who recently came out as a transwoman, and honestly, it felt kind of invalidating and made it harder for me to talk about. I felt like I was being pulled into one way simply because she thought her experience was universally applicable to mine, so I haven't talked to the queer circles I'm a part of since, because I don't want to feel that invalidated again by anyone, cis or trans.

I said this to my girlfriend the best, ""If I could call myself a gender that was just my name and then live my life as I want to, I'd feel at home."" That's really the only thing that actually makes sense to my experience. And more than anything, I'd just like some people to acknowledge that as valid. Then I can feel justified in living my life as a male-presenting genderqueer person who goes by he/him pronouns because why not and that's what I'm the most comfortable with. Just don't assume I'm a man because of that, which admittedly is a bit of a social snafu I'm putting myself in, but that's what makes me the most comfortable and I don't want to apologize for this because I don't really feel like I should. All gender experiences are valid, including mine, so don't try to force me or anyone else one way or another.

I hope this makes sense to anyone who was kind enough to read this.
