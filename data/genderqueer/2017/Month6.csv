2017-06-03 01:06:56,6eygfd,19,21,"Hey all,

Posted this to r/lgbt and someone there suggested I might get better responses and insight here. Feel free to let me know if there is a more appropriate space in another subreddit for this discussion. :) tl;dr at the bottom.

I've recently begun exploring my gender identity and I'm not too sure where I stand or am uber familiar with gender discourse and terminology, but here are some details about me:

* I am gay/am attracted to masculinity
* AMAB and do not feel enough discomfort with my assigned sex to the point where I'm seriously considering transitioning
* I feel neither exclusively male nor exclusively female in gender
* I don't fully subscribe to either of the traditional male or female gender roles
* I mostly dress in male clothes, have a beard, and short hair
* My natural inclination is to act in a feminine manner
* I tend to associate more/feel more comfortable socializing with those who are neither super feminine nor super masculine

I go to a dance studio and take classes that are very femme in style; e.g., femme hip hop/jazz funk, waacking, vogue, heels. Recently, I started taking a heels class where the instructor is a cisfemale and I'm feeling excluded/like the odd person out. Most of her students are also cisfemale and I am one of the few ""males"" there.

I'm not sure if she does them consciously or subconsciously, but the instructor says/does things that seem to favor cisfemales and come off as microaggressions to me. For example, in one class where I was the only one who wasn't cisfemale, she praised the ladies for doing a good job, but then said ""Oh and gentleman, too."" I'd actually feel much more comfortable and included if she had just left it at ""Great job ladies"" than her singling me out. In fact, when dance instructors separate students to perform in groups based on their gender, I often (half-jokingly) say ""I'm a lady"" because I don't quite feel like a ""man"".

She also has parts of the choreography where she has us whip our hair, but then tells the guys: ""For you men, you can do this instead."" I do have short hair, so I guess this is somewhat understandable.

I also notice that she directs her attention and individual praises toward the cisfemales. It somewhat feels like she is affirming cisfemale gender performance and doesn't quite know what to think of my femme non-cis style.

I suppose what I need help with is unpacking my reactions to her actions/words. Is this just insecurity talking? Has anyone ever felt excluded in female-centric spaces where ""female"" seems to mean female in physical sexual characteristics, gender identity, and gender presentation?

I'm also trying to fit my thoughts into a context of feminism and female empowerment. I understand that as an AMAB, I am unable to quite identify with the experiences that these women share together, but I don't think that should preclude me from feeling empowered in female-centric spaces. I fully embrace being femme and feeling sexy and powerful in a feminine manner in my dance classes, but I can't help but feel boxed out of these identities and boxed into being male in situations like those above.

Would truly appreciate any thoughts y'all have. Thanks so much.

I don't feel dysphoric when somebody calls me a he, it's just kinda meh.

2017-06-10 09:32:12,6gef1b,13,14,"Hello. I hope this is the right place. I would have posted in r/questioning otherwise, but I have come to the conclusion that the label ""genderqueer"" might sum me up pretty good. I'm looking to get some things sorted out in my head and have a few questions about it though. I explain each one from a personal POV. 

1) can you have a binary identity and still be genderqueer or is this strictly under the non-binary umbrella? Or is GQ the umbrella term or is it just an alternative, parallel one? 

The reason I'm asking is because I have no issue with identifying as a girl or being called that. I feel a bit uncomfortable when somebody rubs it in my face or makes a big deal of it, but most of the time I don't get dysphoric thoughts or bouts of depresssion out of that alone. ""Woman"" is a bit worse, but I guess there are other issues and (~personal) connotations at play that I'm dealing with at the same time. 

2) Perhaps related, but how non-conforming are most GQ people you've met personally? 

I'm not exactly looking for an explaination on ""how to be x/am I x enough"", but roughly, what level of non-conformity in expression is worthy of even being mentioned or noted (.. to *self* mostly, my culture and language don't have a translation of those terms afaik and that's part of the reason I've come to terms with ""yeah I'm a girl I guess k""). 

3) This one might be the most pressing one. How... does one proceed? 

What do I do now? I have no desire to go on 'mones as I'm just getting my skin sorted out, depression is actually feeling better on BC oddly and I'd have virtually no access, binders don't work (any advice on how to come to terms with boobs? What to think of them, how to argue and persuade myself that it's ok to have them and deal with them so that I don't feel like they give the wrong impression of me as a person?) 
I'm relatively curvy and most men's clothes look super awkward on me. I do however have a thing for sportier outfits, gadgets and hunting knives and fancy things that absolutely *scream* masculinity, and not just from a practical viewpoint; it's often a combination of the idea and the item's quality/style that I find endearing. Wearing boxers, too, and a few other oddities from men's departments. 

Related to the next question, how do I explore this and find balance, avoid an overly butch lesbian look while not compromising on authentic and right-feeling gender expression (biology already has me screwed, I can't afford that)? 

4) Is this going to mean my already limited heterosexuality is going to be limited further by people assuming things/most finding me unattractive?  

I... like boys. A certain subset of them anyway. And no, I'm not looking to be told that gender and sexuality are separate, I know that's the consensus. They seem pretty tied up to me though. I feel quite masculine with a male partner. More feminine with a female one. I prefer both be feminine or at least *unmasculine* themselves and it's the balance of gender expressions, the similarity and alikeness that I find most liberating and bonding. 
Thing is, most boys are going to be turned off by whatever I'm about to do. True, I'm going to filter out some real dollopheads this way and most of the ubermasc-traditional ones (hopefully). Should I make it *clear* in a group that I'm into boys when I spot an attractive one? 

Like, is it hopeless to be into boys and try to do something about the gender thing as well? I feel like proceeding otherwise and continuing to present in a feminine manner would be deceptive and bring hurtful, unwanted results. Is there another way? Looking to cheat the system with a clever hack, probably. 

Last but not least, I'm looking for a *rational, helpful* reply. If I said something wrong or insensitive, do say, but let's not fall to the trap of semantics or ""oh no, you're *really just trans but afraid*, you should transition asap!"" - not going to happen, ever. I'd make an ugly guy with a receding jaw and nonexistent self-esteem, so let us not waste any time on that terrible notion.

2017-06-13 11:07:27,6gz63a,3,17,"Okay, I am pretty new to this sub so I apologize in advance if my post may include possible triggers. I also hope that my choice of language is appropriate and not offensive to anyone.

Currently, I am trying incredibly hard to »accept myself«. I am 22 years old and never felt like I fit in the traditional gender binary. As a child, my parents basically raised me pretty unisex, I mostly played with boys and was primarily also into boy’s activities. I never really liked wearing girl’s clothes (although »being a girl«, although lately I feel less hostile towards potentially wearing a dress, I think my insecurity regarding this has to do a lot with my parents (who are pretty narcissistic) making comments about my experience whenever they could. I.e. I never tried wearing makeup because I did not want anyone to comment on me wearing makeup, I never experimented with clothing much because I did not want to comment anyone on it. I simply hate it when people say something about the way I present myself, both positive and negative. 

I am pretty content with my body. I don’t think I am particularly physically attractive, but the only times I ever felt uncomfortable with having breasts, for example, was during early puberty when once again my parents made comments about said thing happening. But at the same time I sometimes would like to try binding, simply to see how I would feel.

So, I dress pretty »androgynous« and when I recently found out that my name was actually a unisex name in Dutch/French it made me incredibly happy. At some days, I would just like to wake up and be a girl, at others I would just like to have short hair and a mustache, on others I would to be a genderless cyborg.

However, one thing that caused me to feel very off the grid is this: 
I grew up feeling very isolated and started using chatrooms when I was probably 13 years old. Throughout this time I also began to introduce myself to others as an older boy. From what I sense this is probably caused by two things: a) I was bullied in school by a group of older boys and was afraid that if I would reveal anyone I was a girl, they would perceive me as weak, bully me, and so on; b) I also felt much more confident hiding behind this mask, I knew that I was not vulnerable if people never saw a picture of myself (i.e. even with accounts that did not contain any personal information and on which I did not tell anyone something about myself, I felt way more confident than when there was a photo of me – simply because of this incredibly fear of being bullied for my looks again). However, this »catfishing« went on for a couple of years and I feel very guilty for doing it. I am very glad that I am now slowly able to distance myself from it by being more present in real life and by slowly working on myself, and I also know that this was an escapist coping mechanism for me to escape from a very dull, lonely life. I don’t want anyone to sympathize with me for being a former catfishet, I just think this may be a key point of my problem as a whole.

I also have a lot of trouble letting people get close to me in real life because I am so afraid to be hurt. I am trying to be more conscious and listen to people, be more open to them (about panic attacks I have, for example) and the reactions are less horrible than I imagine them being.
So presenting myself as someone online somehow helped me to connect with people, but you know, I want to connect with them as myself but I simply don’t know how to start because there is so much anxiety involved.

I am just so, so confused at the moment. Although I identify as transgender in a way and feel like that I do somehow feel like the term »genderfluid/genderqueer« belongs to me, I am having intrusive thoughts that cause me a lot of anxiety. Thoughts that are basically like: No, you’re actually a man! And it’s freaking me out for some reason, and I don’t know why – is this some sort of internalized transphobia? And how do I get over it?
Some years ago I also went through a similar phase: I was obsessed with eventually being lesbian, did a lot of those online tests, and so on; until I finally came to terms with being attracted to people regardless of what their gender is. It just »magically« happened at some point and I stopped having these thoughts, but then moved on and obsessed about another thing.

Is there any advice you could possibly offer me? I don’t know anyone who identifies as queer and would like to talk to someone (perhaps in private, too?). Once I brought this topic up with a friend and she said nothing but: »You are not trans, you have long hair« – which was so unhelpful and frustrating.

I would just really like to come to terms with my identity, feel content with who I am and be able to live without having doubts and anxiety 24/7, it’s really killing me right now.

2017-06-13 13:05:29,6gzqee,5,2,"I am 24, AMAB, and I've been on HRT for about three months; until I started to experience gender dysphoria a /lot/ (I had had it from being about 14 but it never got particularly bad until about 22), I had never suspected that I'd be trans: I liked girls, I liked my voice, I looked up to masculine role models, I wanted to be strong and stoic and honourable like (*Sigh* cringey, I know), Ned Stark, or Jon Snow. 

And sometimes, I still do want that. But I get dysphoria now about my body, a lot of the time I want boobs, I look at beautiful young girls and feel intense jealousy, but then I also look at strong, well-bearded guys and ALSO feel intense jealousy (Might sound embarrassing but one of the guys I'm most jealous of is Geralt of Rivia &gt;.&gt;) But then I've had times where I get all done up in makeup, put on feminine clothing and pass, and it feels amazing... But neither mode feels like me, and I worry that HRT is permanently transforming me into just one mode, as my changes have been occurring -very- quickly. (I have wondered if I might have an intersex condition or something, considering how I've always looked pretty effeminate even when not trying to). 

I've told myself ""Oh, you can just transition and then dress masc, wear a binder or something"", but I also desperately don't want to lose genital function, which I've been lucky to have had basically unchanged so far despite other changes. I wish that I could find some kind of middle ground, and I've been wondering if it might be better to just stop HRT and call myself a non-binary male, even though I don't feel it captures the full essence of my character. 

My dysphoria comes and goes in constant fluctuation; sometimes I feel like HRT is turning out to be a great idea, other days I want to rip off the patch and stop before I complete the process of some terrible mistake. I've basically accepted now that I am not cisgendered, but personality-wise I have a pretty masculine personality (at least I -think- I do). At the same time I've never been able to engage in many traditional masculine activities due to a disability in my legs, so I'm not going to say that's not a factor in my own perceived lack of masculinity. 

I just wish I had SOME direction; I'm getting private HRT and private therapy, I have to wait until February for proper GIC appointment, and I genuinely just wonder if my feminising myself is a bit of a hasty decision I've made, even though the progress has been what I sometimes consider promisingly and other times consider terrifyingly, swift.

I'm out socially to some friends, my boyfriend's family and my work-from-home job. I'm not out to my family yet because I have ultra conservative parents and lots of anxiety, but I'm working on it. 

Basically, once I'm out to my family (I know I probably need to be out to them before any of this can start), I'd like to pursue HRT and top surgery, and I just had a couple of questions for any of you who have medically transitioned in the UK specifically. (Also, if someone has already made a similar thread, please feel free to point me in that direction!)

1. Has being non-binary or genderfluid impacted your transition in any way? e.g. accessing resources for transition, having to explain non-binary genders to professionals, etc. 

2. My end goal, really, is to be more androgynous than outright masculine; however, I do want to be 'read' as male over female, because I'm super fuckin' tired of being always read as female. In particular, I definitely want a deeper voice and to flatten out some of my curves a bit (I definitely want my chest gone, which is why I'm looking at top surgery later on), but I don't want to be like ... 100% Manly Man. I like the idea of still being somewhat feminine, just not so much so that I'm read as female. Is this actually possible or will I just have to accept being more masculine than I'd like in order to actually feel at home/not constantly anxious in my skin?

3. What has been your overall experience in dealing with health services re: transitioning as a non-binary/genderfluid person? Positive, negative, neither? Doesn't have to be an essay, I just want to know going in whether I'm going to need to brace myself for it to be a struggle.

2017-06-17 01:09:48,6hqnrz,2,29,"So I was making plans to grab lunch with a friend I'm out to, and she had sort of playfully texted saying we should go to Sephora after lunch. I then texted back saying I should go out as my genderqueer self, Mia. She said if I was comfortable doing so I totally should! So for the days before our lunch/shopping day I seriously thought about going, and not going.

I decided I probably wouldn't have another opportunity to do something like this in an environment like a mall so I did. Because I'm not out at home, I wore my clothes under my male clothes (never again will I wear jeans under jeans) and did my makeup minimally as I intended to do it in the car.

So we have lunch, it's pretty decent and we drive a couple blocks down to the mall. Once the car stopped and parked I knew it was now or never. I said I was ready so I took off my guy clothes to reveal the clothes underneath and touched up my makeup. This part is the only thing I'm mad about because the stuff I use for my brows melted (I probably shouldn't have left my purse in the car, but I wasn't dressed at the restaurant) and today my wings decided to not cooperate so just went without any :(. Honestly I'm so mad about it still lol. Also my good friend five o clock shadow decided to stop by (I made sure to shave as close as possible and cover it up the best I could). While it wasn't prominent I could see it in the mirror a little bit. I grabbed my wig and made sure it was placed perfectly and we got out of the car. She said I looked good even though I knew I didn't pass as well as I hoped (damn you makeup and hot weather) but it was great she didn't laugh or have any reaction like that. In fact she treated it as if it was nothing and like it was natural, so bless her for that!

We stopped at a couple stores where she tried on some stuff and I tried on one thing but ended up not getting it because I was on a budget lol. In fact I even got ""she'd"" while waiting in line for the dressing room so that was totally awesome! I was still incredibly nervous and shy because I felt like the employees saw through my passing attempt but they treated me like any other customer. Also while walking thorugh the mall I didn't get as many stares or any under the breath remarks as I could tell, which is still totally awesome!

My friend needed to go the restroom. Oh boy the big restroom moment. Before going in I was thinking should I go in with her or wait outside. I ended up waiting outside, mainly since I didn't need to go or check my tuck (which held pretty well throughout the day). This was my first moment alone and I just waited for her as I stared at my phone trying not to make any eye contact. While she was in the dressing rooms I was left alone for a couple minutes a time so I was really nervous then. As soon as she came out I immediately went straight to her lol.

We went to a couple more stores and Sephora. Now I had been makeup shopping before, but just as a guy so it wasn't something too out of left field for me. The lady at the cashier was super nice and welcoming also. My friend said I should get a makeover and get help for anything but decided not to, mainly because I didn't want to buy anything, have her wait for me, and I would end up just taking it off several minutes after on the way home.

As we were walking back to her car we almost ran into two people we knew. She ran into someone she knew on our way in, so I sort of just looked the other way. She totally could tell I wasn't ready for a confrontation with these two people, especially because I'm not out to everyone so she asked if I wanted to chill and we did until he was out of sight.

Driving on the way home she asked how I felt and I said way better than I had thought, and that I would totally do it again! So to my friend, thank you for being just so totally open minded and comforting me, and just treating me like a normal friend. It was a huge confidence booster having you around! Like I couldn't ask for anything more.

Maybe next time my makeup will be more forgiving to me lol.

Also, to anybody out there worried about going out in public for the first time it's not as scary as you think. Sure I was super self conscious and I had a million thoughts going on at once, but really that's just your brain and your comfort zone trying to tell you otherwise (unless you're not in a safe area, that I totally understand is a different situation). Just do it when you're ready and take baby steps if you have to. Go with a friend, it'll be much easier!

This part is the only thing I\'m mad about because the stuff I use for my brows melted (I probably shouldn\'t have left my purse in the car, but I wasn\'t dressed at the restaurant) and today my wings decided to not cooperate so just went without any :(. Honestly I\'m so mad about it still lol. Also my good friend five o clock shadow decided to stop by (I made sure to shave as close as possible and cover it up the best I could). While it wasn\'t prominent I could see it in the mirror a little bit. I grabbed my wig and made sure it was placed perfectly and we got out of the car. She said I looked good even though I knew I didn\'t pass as well as I hoped (damn you makeup and hot weather) but it was great she didn\'t laugh or have any reaction like that. In fact she treated it as if it was nothing and like it was natural, so bless her for that!\n\nWe stopped at a couple stores where she tried on some stuff and I tried on one thing but ended up not getting it because I was on a budget lol. In fact I even got ""she\'d"" while waiting in line for the dressing room so that was totally awesome! I was still incredibly nervous and shy because I felt like the employees saw through my passing attempt but they treated me like any other customer. Also while walking thorugh the mall I didn\'t get as many stares or any under the breath remarks as I could tell, which is still totally awesome!\n\nMy friend needed to go the restroom. Oh boy the big restroom moment. Before going in I was thinking should I go in with her or wait outside. I ended up waiting outside, mainly since I didn\'t need to go or check my tuck (which held pretty well throughout the day). This was my first moment alone and I just waited for her as I stared at my phone trying not to make any eye contact. While she was in the dressing rooms I was left alone for a couple minutes a time so I was really nervous then. As soon as she came out I immediately went straight to her lol.\n\nWe went to a couple more stores and Sephora. Now I had been makeup shopping before, but just as a guy so it wasn\'t something too out of left field for me. The lady at the cashier was super nice and welcoming also. My friend said I should get a makeover and get help for anything but decided not to, mainly because I didn\'t want to buy anything, have her wait for me, and I would end up just taking it off several minutes after on the way home.\n\nAs we were walking back to her car we almost ran into two people we knew. She ran into someone she knew on our way in, so I sort of just looked the other way. She totally could tell I wasn\'t ready for a confrontation with these two people, especially because I\'m not out to everyone so she asked if I wanted to chill and we did until he was out of sight.\n\nDriving on the way home she asked how I felt and I said way better than I had thought, and that I would totally do it again! So to my friend, thank you for being just so totally open minded and comforting me, and just treating me like a normal friend. It was a huge confidence booster having you around! Like I couldn\'t ask for anything more.\n\nMaybe next time my makeup will be more forgiving to me lol.\n\nAlso, to anybody out there worried about going out in public for the first time it\'s not as scary as you think. Sure I was super self conscious and I had a million thoughts going on at once, but really that\'s just your brain and your comfort zone trying to tell you otherwise (unless you\'re not in a safe area, that I totally understand is a different situation). Just do it when you\'re ready and take baby steps if you have to. Go with a friend, it\'ll be much easier!\n\nEdit: five o clock shadow and more info', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'I went out as the first time!

I was originally going to do a long post now about where i've got up to since then, but instead i thought it might be more fun to do a lost of cool things that i've discovered/re-discovered about feeling more femme and being honest with myself.

1) Jeggings are awesome!!!! So i ordered what I THOUGHT was a pair of Zara Women's low rise jeans from Ebay (broke shopping haha). When they arrived they had no front pockets, fit really tight in the best possible way, and were really stretchy....my S/O informed me they were in fact Jeggings. No loss to me coz they're super comfy, fit better then any pair of jeans i've ever owned and make me feel way more femme, particularly when paired with item 2). 

2) T shirt dresses - I'd been wearing longline mens shirts for awhile because they felt more Androgynous then standard Guy fit shirts, but actually getting some T shirt dresses (in my case, an All Saints one via Ebay- broke shopping again) has made me feel great. It look enough like a longline T-shirt to ""pass"" which is helpful to me because I'm not out in general socially (although I'm now operating a strict no lying/denying rule - see number 3) but makes me feel more balanced, and covers any ""give away features"" that might occur when wearing super tight jeans/jeggings!!

3) Being honest with myself. Im now operating a strict No Lying/Denying Policy...which in practice means I'm under no pressure to actively tell anyone about my Gender Identity (after all, it's my business right?) but If anyone asks or raises Gender as an issue, Im not going to deny who I am anymore. I've ""officially"" come out to my S/O, and a couple of close friends, and though it was hard, no one has been mean or actively tried to make me feel bad which is ace. Im not naive enough to think my relationship with myself/Gender will always be easy (it still isn't in fact) but I feel better knowing that Im not lying to myself or anyone else anymore. 

4) Smooth Armpits - I've Actively been doing bits of hair removal for a long time, and in fact It was kind of part of what led me to think about my Gender Identity in the first place, but I had never have my armpits until after I came out on here, and to my S/O. 

I guess its not something that is easily explained as ""societally normal"" for AMAB people, which even shaved legs are (if you want to pretend you're a cyclist or something!) so for me at least, it kinda felt like a small but relevant step to feeling more Androgyne. Anyways, smooth armpits feel great!

5) ""Passing"" as Being an enigma - I think it's ace when people want to mess with societal expectations and present in ways that some people might find strange, but thats not really me as i'm kinda shy in an overexcited talks-too-much-when-nervous way (if that makes sense) Anyways, today I was at Boots (a drugstore/pharmacy here in the UK) buying a bunch of face care stuff. When I got to the checkout the girl serving me was asked a question by another staff member and she replied

""hold on, let me just serve this........person........first"". I was wearing cherry tinted Lip Balm, foundation and eyeliner, but as it was a crazy  hot makeup melting day i'm pretty sure my stubble shadow was showing....Maybe she was just being Gender-Neutral-Descriptor awesome, but I felt like she couldn't tell my Gender, and that made me really happy.

My understanding of myself is that I reject dominance in all forms -- feel no desire to dominate others and also feel intense anger when other people try to dominate or humiliate me. I want egalitarianism, basically.

I've never felt like one of the girls, and often feel no connection to women's programs, advertising, apparel, or in general most ""female focused"" things (an example is a school program I participated in as a child for female body positivity, I felt like an outsider and just joined because of friends, because though I had body issues they didn't feel ""female""). However I also feel no connection with male things or gender. I'm ok with female pronouns but have an adverse reaction to the use of my name outside very few people.

My worry is this isn't gender related and instead has to do with my anxiety and depression. Im overweight, and am currently seeking a psychiatrist to talk about ASD. I have large breasts and am getting a reduction and can't suppress the urge to ask for them gone completely.  I want to look like I have no gender, but I can't tell if this is because I dislike my appearance or if it's because I appear female.

2017-06-22 19:12:40,6ivqlx,0,7,"So I've been out as genderqueer to a handful of friends for 3 months now. They all took it extremely well and have been super supportive which is awesome. However recently I've been thinking about transitioning (mtf) or at least taking hormones. On one hand I'm not entirely uncomfortable being male, but on the other I wouldn't mind being perceived as female and to live as one. This is the point where I'm at and confused about. I've think that my male-ness is more from expression rather than it being identity, but I can't be for sure. For example last week I went to a friend's graduation party and found myself subconsciously standing with the girls rather than the guys, and thinking about this made me remember the other times this has happened before. But like I said, I'm not entirely uncomfortable being male, but there are those times. I know I'm not cis and at the very least I'm genderfluid/genderqueer. which I'm not ashamed of identifying as at the moment.

HRT has mainly been on my mind, but I'm not sure if it's something to help my identity rather than expression. I've been seeing all the posts on places like /r/transpassing and feeling jealous, so again I'm not sure if it's because I want to transition and identify fully as a woman or not. I know there's that question people always ask that if you had a button that can change your gender would you press it and I would.

My next issue is basically everybody's issue when questioning gender and that's coming out. I know most of my friends will be 100% supportive, but I'm afraid of doing so to my parents and family. I'd say my family is fairly moderate when it comes to issues like these, not too liberal or conservative. We do have two uncles that are gay and everybody is fine with that so I'm pretty sure they would be fine with me being trans, but can't be too sure. I'm also a little worried how some friends would take it that I haven't come out to.

And as of now, if hypothetically my coming out goes great, I probably wouldn't be able to start going to a therapist or to start HRT since there's some pretty big things going on right now financially wise and with insurance, so I don't expect starting soon, and maybe in at least a year. Also my parents would be paying for everything so that's why I feel I should come out to them.

I guess I'm having a hard time distinguishing identity and expression and whether or not transitioning would help me with dysphoria.

The past 3 months I've really been giving this thought and it took me 2 years to come to the conclusion I'm genderfluid now, so I'll definitely be giving this more thought.

Writing this makes me realize that some days I'll be totally happy identifying as genderfluid but other days I wish I would be ""binary"" transgender and transition completely and only identify as female, which is where the ""button"" scenario comes from, as well as some of my dysphoria. I know a lot of gf/nb people who do take hormones so I could also do that and again see how I feel about it.

I know each person has a different definition of genderfluid and not everybody follows the same path transitioning, so I guess it's hard for me really to define my identity. Maybe I'm still thinking about this from a ""cis"" perspective since that's the way I've been trained to think that way for the 19 years I've been alive and that I'm still trying distinguish my expression and identity.

My only issue is my name. I don't feel comfortable sharing it on here or anywhere, it doesn't feel right for me, I cringe every time I see or hear it used in relation to me... it's a total headache.

Lately, I've been trying to refer to my fursona in less gendered way as an experimentation for myself, and I've caught myself thinking about 'it' for a while. In portuguese I've never heard the ""elu"" pronouns (a gender-neutral pronoun in PT) being spoken, just written. So IRL I wouldn't mind being called in any way - for I am AMAB and I don't care about looks, and mostly the 'standard (not so genderless) look' is basically masculine, I get treated as a boy; which might get frustrating when people have the strong urge to force that 'gender mask/uniform' on me, while I've never explicitly given any reason to do so.
But the english language makes it a bit more interesting to me. I've learnt that the pronoun 'it' is used to animals and inanimate objects, i.e. 'it' is oblivious to society's understanding of gender; while 'them' is neutral and still seems to expect a clarification on the gender, be it binary or nonbinary. Considering the pronoun 'it' might mean I'm agender, but I don't know (can any agender person out there comment if this sounds like agender for ya?); as an ace aro I would say it should be easier to know how that feels for sure, but well... It's not. What I do know is that the most often I just wish not to fit any gender.

TL;DR: 'it' seems to explicitly point out inapplicability of gender, not just neutrality, and I'm willing to experiment how that feels.

2017-06-27 21:48:53,6jw1sm,13,7,"Hi, I'm just curious what people in this sub do about different languages and the way that gender is treated in those languages, or problems they have faced in languages other than English.

Some languages and cultures seem more resistant to coming up with gender-neutral solutions than others--and in some languages, it's not an issue. I searched the sub for discussions on this topic and I found [this post about languages in general](https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/1m52v1/if_you_were_using_a_language_that_uses_gender/), [this post mostly about Romance languages](https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/5rae4s/my_choice_of_pronouns_for_my_partners_native/), and [this news article about Hebrew](https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2016/08/11/what-does-a-gender-neutral-kid-call-themself-in-a-gendered-language/).

Personally, I have felt really held back when speaking Spanish, even though I have a pretty good comprehension level of the language. But since I was young I always felt uncomfortable if I have to say anything about myself in Spanish, because it would force me to think about and express my gender. So, I developed a habit of simply never sayng anything about myself or just expressing things about me in roundabout ways. Recently I learned that some nonbinary and genderqueer speakers of Spanish have been using ""-e"" on the ends of words and using ""elle"" as a gender neutral pronoun. It's not official, but I hope that it gains popularity and I would be curious to know if anyone here speaks Spanish and could elaborate on this.

I also speak Esperanto and in Esperanto I feel it's much easier to be gender neutral. It's very similar to English when it comes to the pronoun choices (""she"" = ""ŝi"", ""he"" = ""li"", they = ""ili"", it = ""ĝi"") and lack of gendering via verbs and adjectives, but there is arguably more progress with a 3rd person singular gender neutral pronoun (""ri"") than in English. The pronoun is unofficial but I think the majority of long-time speakers are familiar with its existence and understand its meaning as it has been in existence since the 1970's, as far as I know. If someone tries to argue with you about it, it's generally because they don't like new words in the language (and because originally ""it"" or ""ĝi"" was not an offensive term for humans), not because they think being nonbinary is invalid (although of course those people exist, too). I find that gender neutrality and pronoun use are a very frequent topic of discussion in the Esperanto community and peoples opinions tend to boil down to grammar worries, not so much on fighting about trans people. Most people who don't want to use ""ri"" still try to help people come up with a solution for being gender neutral that still follows the traditional rules of the language (I could go into detail on this if anyone is curious). 

Finally, I have been learning Korean and for the most part, it's very convenient because unlike many languages I have explored in the past, verbs and adjectives do nothing to reveal one's gender, and there are virtually no gendered pronouns--you can become specific about gender if it's necessary, but you actually just do not include 3rd person pronouns almost all of the time. That's very convenient for a nonbinary person. However, there is also a system of kinship terms and other social titles that can get very specific about gender. Common ones are words that you call people who you are close with, that happen to rely not only their gender, but yours as well. If you are male, you call older males ""hyung"" and older females ""nuna"" and if you are female you call older males ""oppa"" and older females ""unnie"". I don't feel confident enough in this language to be calling any shots on how to deal with this issue as a nonbinary person, but I am curious if anyone here speaks Korean and knows of a solution. Edit: Also, I feel that in S. Korea there is a stronger social reenforcement of binary gender expression, and that LGBT issues are more taboo than, for comparison, in the US.

I came out to my partner as non-binary about a year ago. She's been amazing, and continues to surprise and delight me with her support of all the changes coming out has presented me. Still, that's not to say it's been like a ""fairy tale.""

We've both had difficulties and ups and downs. It's easy for me to see how difficult this experience has been on her. I have a great family and group of friends who have been so supportive. It has been hard for her to feel like she should be the most supportive but also be authentic in her fears, anxieties, and doubts. And I greatly admire that authenticity.

I'm wondering for those who have come out to a partner, what that experience has been like for the both of you? I think it's far too easy to feel alone in our experiences. Anything you'd be willing to contribute would be so helpful.",genderqueer,Coming out to your partner.,1498873065.0,"{'created_utc': 1498847865, 'id': '6khvc7', 'num_comments': 3, 'score': 7, 'selftext': 'Hey everyone,\n\nI came out to my partner as non-binary about a year ago.

2017-06-30 21:13:57,6kivhy,19,12,"I've recently had a problem happen multiple times on social media, all with people who I know from real life, of like, people will bend over backwards to respect my gender identity, sometimes like, profuse / repeated apologies for misgendering, or apologizing for things that don't even bother me like addressing a group of people including me as ""you guys"", but like, when a conversation becomes tense, especially if/when I'm voicing a more conservative viewpoint on a particular issue, or disagreeing with a particular point being made in a feminist discussion, all this goes out the window, and people will treat me very aggressively and often accuse me of ""mansplaining"" or say ""well you're just a man so you blah blah blah..."" and then spout a bunch of untruths about me.

I find it really frustrating for multiple reasons.  For one, I don't identify as a man and many of the things people say in their reasoning is outright wrong.  For two, I hate words like ""mansplaining"" from an ideological standpoint, they're unnecessarily gendered in ways that I think are binarist, and I also think they can reinforce toxic masculinity and have some anti-feminist effects even if people might claim to be coming from a feminist perspective when they say them.  And for three, when people respond with that sort of word or other similar dismissing ""Well you're just a man so blah blah blah..."" in response to me voicing either a more conservative viewpoint, or disagreeing with a point of feminist ideology, it plays into this awful stereotype that all trans people must think alike, so if you don't think like that then you're not legitimately trans you're just some shitty frat dudebro or whatever the left-wing stereotype is.

This stuff makes me feel like, I'm only trans when it feels good for other people to ""protect"" me.  I'm suddenly not trans when people dislike what I'm trying to say, especially if being ""male"" gives them fuel to attack me or dismiss my voice.

It's also especially frustrating because I feel like our society elevates masculinity over femininity, and I think that includes elevating a more aggressive ""This is the way it is."" way of wording statements...and like, I tend to word things more in a ""This is my experience."" type of way, using a lot of I-statements...and then I often get shut down, spoken over, and even shamed by women who criticize me for ""talking about myself"" when I'm using I-statements out of respect.  So it's like, from my perspective, I feel like I'm getting talked over and shut down a lot, because the way I communicate, presenting things as my own personal experience or perspective, is not taken as seriously by mainstream society...but then people accuse me of like, being in the ""dominant"" position in the power hierarchy because they gender me male.

I've had people react this way when I've raised concerns of how certain forms of feminism are reinforcing transphobia or binarism.  I've also had people react this way when I'm voicing viewpoints completely unrelated to feminism or gender, or related in other ways.  For example, recently I've gotten attacked a lot whenever I bring up the topic of fiscal conservatism.  I identify as a fiscal conservative and I find people make a lot of false assumptions about me on the basis of this, like they assume I want to cut social welfare programs or things like that, or assume that I agree with everything the Republican party has been advocating for recently, which is very far from the truth.

For example, today I was attacked in this way when I was voicing concerns about labor unions.  A major concern I raised was that I think labor unions can sometimes reinforce traditional sexism and other hierarchical power structures, and how I think it is frustrating when people on the left support unions unconditionally, and that I sometimes think that protecting oppressed people necessitates some degree of skepticism of labor unions.  And then I was accused of ""mansplaining"".

I don't expect or demand for people to agree with me.  But I want people to acknowledge the fact that I'm trans and nonbinary, transfeminine specifically, and that I can hold certain conservative viewpoints...in fact, that certain conservative viewpoints or stances that I hold, are a direct result of some of the experiences I've had with gender, which have showed me some of the problems, hypocrisies, or internal inconsistencies in some left-wing ideology.

Has anyone else encountered any problems like this?  Any advice about how to approach it?  I have been unfriending and blocking a lot of people recently, but it's frustrating because I feel like it just keeps happening...there's an almost endless supply of people in my social network who will dismiss or attack my gender as soon as I disagree with them even on a minor point of political or feminist ideology.",genderqueer,"Accusations of Mansplaining, Dismissing my Identity in Discussions of Politics or Feminism",1498882437.0,"{'created_utc': 1498857237, 'id': '6kivhy', 'num_comments': 19, 'score': 12, 'selftext': 'I\'ve recently had a problem happen multiple times on social media, all with people who I know from real life, of like, people will bend over backwards to respect my gender identity, sometimes like, profuse / repeated apologies for misgendering, or apologizing for things that don\'t even bother me like addressing a group of people including me as ""you guys"", but like, when a conversation becomes tense, especially if/when I\'m voicing a more conservative viewpoint on a particular issue, or disagreeing with a particular point being made in a feminist discussion, all this goes out the window, and people will treat me very aggressively and often accuse me of ""mansplaining"" or say ""well you\'re just a man so you blah blah blah..."" and then spout a bunch of untruths about me.\n\nI find it really frustrating for multiple reasons.
