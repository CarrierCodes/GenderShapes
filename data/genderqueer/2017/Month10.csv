2017-10-01 01:55:45,73j0qj,6,4,"I was born with a vagina and assigned to the female gender. I grew up in a conservative, fundamental baptist, missionary family. Although always subconsciously being uncomfortable with my gender and constantly hating the fact I could never seem to fit in with girls at all, I was taught and fully believed that there are two genders, and your genitalia determines which gender you are. 

Since my deconversion and bipolar disorder diagnosis, I've gone through a LOT of questioning, shifting feelings, and frustration.

During my worst periods of depression I felt almost completely masculine, but didn't feel any dysphoria due to my female body. I just hated being perceived as a girl. I seriously thought about transitioning for a long time, but later was really glad I hadn't because I discovered that in sexual situations, I almost always feel like a girl and love it.

After a couple suicide attempts and visits to the mental hospital, I decided I was agender since gender for some reason just didn't matter to me anymore. This bothered my then-boyfriend, and he broke up with me, inadvertently pushing me back to feeling more masculine.

I felt very masculine for a long time, but felt no need to change my physical body. Dressing and acting like a man was enough, so I identified as a demiboy.

As my mental health improved, I swung back to feeling more gender neutral and feminine, so I thought, ""Of course! I must be genderfluid.""
For a few months my feelings and identity didn't change, and I was somewhere between feminine and neutral. Then suddenly, I had a bad violent episode which was foreshadowed by my swinging quickly to the masculine side of the spectrum.

Since I've gotten things under control, I don't really know what I am. I look in the mirror and don't see a gender. I hate the idea of coming out as genderfluid to people because one, my Christian family already think I'm a mental case, and two, I'm too anxious about how I'm perceived by others. I feel like how I'm perceived is up to me, and whatever pronouns they naturally use is a result of that.

Before then, I would have some fantasies about dressing in drag or whathaveyou, but I never really considered what that meant. I was born a dude, and I never really questioned it. I just thought that I could live with it, that while I did have desires of wearing skirts and leggings, growing out my hair, and having a more feminine voice, that those desires were manageable, that I could live the rest of my life as a man without too much trouble.

For a while in my second year of university (I've since graduated) I participated a little with my uni's queer group/club, presenting as a straight cis ally. I hung out quite a few times and attempted to make friends, but from my Christian upbringing, I still had some really bad LGBT-phobic hangups that made me really insecure about hanging out with them, because I didn't want to say something stupid and hurt someone's feelings.

I then dived into research, asked some questions, asked my supportive sister for help, and started looking for therapists, because this isn't going away right now, and this cycle of doubt leading to self-acceptance leading back to doubt isn't going to stop.

Sometimes I like to think of myself as a woman. Then other times I see myself as nothing more than your usual guy.

(Context: I'm biologically male, and I present as predominantly male while at work, but I feel and/or present as a feminine-ish male at many points. Also, I'm kind of drunk while I'm typing this. It's a four day weekend for me because of Columbus Day, so if shit doesn't make logical sense at any points, that's why.)

I look at myself in the mirror, and I see my bulking arms and six pack and think to myself, ""I REALLY like this. I want to improve this body image and be pretty exclusively male.""

Then during many times throughout the day, I look at myself and think, ""Gosh, I hate my male body. I wish I was a woman. I would love to have boobs and a pretty, slim body like my wife."" (I'm married to a biological female who also identifies as genderqueer and who presents predominantly as female).

Sometimes I say to my reflection in the mirror, ""I wish I was born a biological female who was a trans male. Buff but with a vagina."" Other times I say, ""I'm glad I was born biologically male, because I can be a woman when I transition but still have my dick.""

This is a constant and daily struggle for me. I want to transition to female, but I don't. I want to be a woman so I could transition to male, but at the same time, I want to be feminine. At points I share and feel characteristics of both feminine and masculine personalities. WTF?!!

What/who am I?

Am I a woman? Am I a man? Is this what genderqueer people always feel? To many of my coworkers, they think I want to be a woman, but to me, I want to be a man and a woman and kind of both-ish, kind of. If that makes any sense...

I wish there was just some magic/science that would let me flip a switch to be whatever I wanted at that moment. Actually, I wouldn't mind being a woman permanently if I was the pretty girl I want to be, but then again, I like my huge muscles... Son of a bitch...

So yeah... can anyone relate? Am I alone in these thoughts?

Again, kind of drunk right now. I apologize. I don't have a drinking problem. I just have a problem expressing myself sometimes.

Thank you.

(I\'m married to a biological female who also identifies as genderqueer and who presents predominantly as female).\n\nSometimes I say to my reflection in the mirror, ""I wish I was born a biological female who was a trans male. Buff but with a vagina."" Other times I say, ""I\'m glad I was born biologically male, because I can be a woman when I transition but still have my dick.""\n\nThis is a constant and daily struggle for me. I want to transition to female, but I don\'t. I want to be a woman so I could transition to male, but at the same time, I want to be feminine. At points I share and feel characteristics of both feminine and masculine personalities. WTF?!!\n\nWhat/who am I?\n\nAm I a woman? Am I a man? Is this what genderqueer people always feel? To many of my coworkers, they think I want to be a woman, but to me, I want to be a man and a woman and kind of both-ish, kind of. If that makes any sense...\n\nI wish there was just some magic/science that would let me flip a switch to be whatever I wanted at that moment. Actually, I wouldn\'t mind being a woman permanently if I was the pretty girl I want to be, but then again, I like my huge muscles... Son of a bitch...\n\nSo yeah... can anyone relate? Am I alone in these thoughts?\n\nAgain, kind of drunk right now. I apologize. I don\'t have a drinking problem.

I haven't talked about this to anyone. The first person I'd like to tell is my partner. Then on to my friends and coworkers. I'm worried about how people will take this, and if they'll resist the change because they know me as Tabitha already. 

Have you changed your name or started using a nickname? How did you first start the conversation? How did it go? Do you have any other advice on how to ease this transition?

2017-10-08 09:39:25,750tse,6,7,"Hey y'all! I'm new to being genderqueer, this thread, and actually Reddit completely (I only just created a Reddit to find some NB/GQ community), and I have a bunch of questions that I'd appreciate some insight on! I'll try to seperate them clearly to make what I'm sure will be a super long post more manageable :)

Pronouns: 

Are there any good singular ones out there? I've been using they/them because I don't like anything else I've seen (Ze/zir or xe/xir) and I was wondering if there were more gender neutral pronouns I hadn't heard of.

Also I need some advice on how to deal with being misgendered. After I realized I was genderqueer, being misgendered began to feel like an electric shock. It makes me feel absolutely horrible, and usually I'm too stunned to respond and correct people. When strangers do it, I get too scared to say anything because I have no idea if that person is going to further invalidate me (or do something even worse?); when it's people I know, I fall into an immediate depression since being misgendered means they are failing to recognize something so important to me and my identity (as I've come out to most people I know). So I was wondering what I can do to get over this shock and even just how to correct people when they misgender me. Right now I have a community of people who take a lot of the pressure off by correcting people when they slip up on my pronouns, but I want to be able to speak up for myself.

Feminism:

Does anyone have any resources from genderqueer/nonbinary on their relationship with feminism? Being AFAB I was a pretty hardcore feminist until recently, when both my better informed leftist ideology and newly realized genderqueer identity have put a rift between me and feminism. I was wondering if anyone has explored this topic and how to repair or replace my relationship with the feminist movement, which had such a big impact in my life.

Tiddies: 

Can any AFAB people (esp those who have/had a bigger chest) offer some advice on complete top surgery v reduction? I don't have debilitating dysphoria or anything, but I don't like my chest. Like, I spend a bunch of time in the mirror pushin them out of the way, getting excited about how I look with them hidden at certain angles, and doing what I can to minimize how they look underclothing. But I constantly hear this voice in my head saying ""you only want them gone bc they're a big reason you get misgendered/they're so big and saggy they're not even attractive anymore/they cause so much back pain/they're just annoying"". Sometimes I even like being a little femme and enjoy the aesthetic so that also complicates my feelings on the issue. Plus my partner loves them, and when he's on them I don't really mind that I have them.
I'm really thinking about getting a reduction down to maybe a B or a C cup — something that can look like a flat chest with just a sports bra and a calculated outfit. I feel like 93% of the time I want to be flat, but I don't want to feel limited for that small 7% of the time I want to feel femme and a lil curvy. Has anyone done this and if so how satisfied were you? Is this easier to get insurance to cover because I'm sure I have enough back issues to actually warrant a Breast reduction? How do I not feel like a bad queer for not wanting the more masc look of full top surgery?

And in the meantime, does anyone know of any brands that make more masc/neutral bras in my size (32H)? I know this is a tall order bc honestly just finding places that make bras in my size at all is so difficult. But I just bought some masc underwear and it's really improved my comfort and confidence, except now my bras and therefore my chest seem more feminine embellished in tiny bows and lace and satin fabrics.

Identiddies: 

What made you tend toward the genderqueer label? And do you ever use other labels with or instead of GQ? I've been using it just because it seemed as though it had the most room for interpretation, which has been helpful as I do more and more gender exploring, but I'm curious what connotations y'all have with the term.

2017-10-08 17:35:39,7533ny,5,14,"Hi, r/genderqueer! 

Just a few days ago, I realized that I no longer felt that I identified with the gender I was assigned at birth. It was all instantly clear to me: that the insecurity about my body and male identity that I have felt since middle school was gender dysphoria.  

However, while I am now certain that I don't relate to the gender I was assigned at birth, I'm not sure exactly how to locate myself in terms of gender.

2017-10-15 23:01:16,76me1j,5,4,"Hi folks! 

I’m brand new to reddit. I feel a little bit overwhelmed at the prospect of introducing myself and trying to explain my background, but I'm going to give it a shot. At the end of this post, I’m going to ask some questions - in case you want to just skip straight to those.  

I’m AFAB, 28 years old, and I’ve been part of the queer community/out as queer for 11 years now. I've had complicated feelings about my gender for about the same amount of time. My gender (and my sexuality) have always kind of felt like moving, shifting things, but that hasn't stopped me from trying to pin them down or make them stay still. 
 
I've employed a number of strategies to that end, some of which involved ways of identifying or taking up labels, and some of which involved more material actions, like disavowing makeup for a period of time, or, alternatively, embracing makeup fully and wearing it every day. It usually works for a while and I feel stable in my identity, until things shift again.

In recognition of this, I’ve been identifying these days as gender fluid, and also genderqueer and non-binary (although I think claiming those identities for myself feels a bit more scary, for a few reasons). I’ve also felt some resonance with the terms bi-gender and androgyne. 

I've tried a number of times to get comfortable in the identity of Femme, because a) I think a lot of people assume that's how I identify, and it would make sense to a large degree. I have and continue to present in a way that many people would consider feminine. I often wear mascara, I don't often bind, right now I have long hair (it's a mullet - ha!), and (I think this is key) all those things on a body that was assigned female at birth are interpreted as feminine, or as femme. And b) I've wanted to identify as femme because I think that for a lot of other people, genderfluid and genderqueer people included, femme feels like a constant, a home, something they can always come back to, an undercurrent that's always there. That seems very appealing to me. I would like to have that. But while I'm arguably femme-presenting, I just can't seem to make Femme fit for myself. 

Mostly the strategy I've used to deal with my unwieldy identity has been to try not to think about it. That has seemed easier than trying to figure out what's going on with me, much less trying to put words to it. I haven't really had the words. Until recently, it hadn't occurred to me that someone femme/femme-presenting who was assigned female at birth could identify as non-binary. The first time I read about it, I was like ""Oh. Ohhhh. Oh fuck."" Surprise, then resonance. And then dread, on some level... It felt a bit like opening a huge can of worms. I had come across an article by Sam Escobar - have any of you come across them in your internet wanderings? They’re an editor at Allure magazine… Anyway, I’ll link to some of the articles I read at the end of my post.  

I think another factor that prevented me from coming to understand myself as non-binary or genderqueer was the relationship I had been in. I spent the better part of 10 years in a relationship wherein there wasn't space for me in any kind of meaningful or safe way - not my feelings, not my identity, especially if those things were contrary or threatening to my partner's. It was part of an overarching theme/power imbalance in that relationship, that resulted in the focus always coming to rest on my partner and his identity and his gender. I very often felt that it was part of my ""job"" in the relationship to validate or prop up my partner's masculinity by appearing feminine - really, by appearing to be a straight, cis woman. The focus was on my partner's gender, and I didn't feel like there was space to think about mine, never mind question it. I'm not in that relationship anymore, thankfully. 

I'm in a different relationship now, where there is all kinds of space for me to think about and question my gender, and present however the hell I want (which, I find, is easier said than done). Over the past number of months, a few things related to my gender have come up because of my relationship. For one thing, I've begun to acknowledge some desires that I have that are gender or sex-related (in both senses of the word). I’m still in the process of figuring out the implications (or lack thereof) of the stuff that I’ve acknowledged/admitted to myself. I feel very grateful that there is space in my relationship for this stuff, although I still have a very hard time trusting that that will continue to be the case (just because of past relationship baggage).

 The other thing that has come up is that I feel unexpectedly invested in not being read as a heterosexual woman, which I guess makes sense - I just care way more about this now than I have in the past. My current partner is on testosterone, and as they are read increasingly as a guy by the world, I feel myself pushing back against any potential collapsing of my identity under heteronormativity. There’s this weird fucking thing that happens when AFAB femme-presenting people are partnered with folks who the world assumes identify as men; people seem to assume that the partners of men must be straight cis women. At least, that’s what my experience has been. And I really don’t want that to happen. Only now, I’m not sure if it’s because I don’t want to be unintelligible as queer, or if it’s due to my discomfort with identifying as a woman. I think I feel more pressure (or put more pressure on myself) to present in a more masculine way sometimes as a result of all this, and I’m trying to tease out when that is the case. 

And here’s another thing: I’m pretty scared of the implications of claiming a non-binary identity. I’m scared of what I will find if I start to explore my identity more. 

When my current partner and I started dating, they identified as non-binary, and they are definitely in touch with their femininity. During the time we’ve been together, they’ve started testosterone, and it’s turing out to be a really good fit for them. Seeing them move through their process around their gender and around their trans identity has been really interesting for me, because they haven’t followed what is often called the “typical” trans narrative or path, and I can relate to aspects of their experience; some of it resonates with me. And I can also relate to the experiences of other non-binary folks, like Sam Escobar, and like other folks in my community. 

I guess the thing is, I always thought on some level (probably a subconscious one) that because I’m comfortable wearing makeup a lot of the time, and because I have liked and identified with things that are typically deemed feminine throughout my life - because I have presented femininely (and do!) and liked it, I couldn’t be non-binary, and I definitely could not be trans. But with all of these new realizations and new ways of being and identifying - and specifically, with people who look like me claiming non-binary identities - now I’m not so sure. About any of it. And it’s a beautiful, beautiful thing, and it’s also deeply unsettling and terrifying. It scares the shit out of me.

I’d be really curious to know if any of you have had similar experiences or thoughts, and what your journeys have been to identifying however you identify.

Do you use they/them pronouns, and how do you deal with people fucking them up? I feel like I’ve done a lot of gender labour in my life, and I’m worried that going by they/them pronouns (even if it might feel better for me) would amount to a huge amount of work. I’m scared to take that on. 

I would also really love to know - for those of you who identify as gender fluid - how that plays out for you, and how you deal with it. Sometimes the way I feel about my gender shifts in the middle of the day, and it’s hard to deal with… Any strategies? 

And one final question: are you out about your identity, and to what extent? Do you have strategies that you use that help you feel visible and/or valid? I've come out many times before with different aspects of my identity, but I'm really scared to come out about this one. I'm afraid people won't believe me or see my identity as valid, essentially.

I feel a little bit overwhelmed at the prospect of introducing myself and trying to explain my background, but I\'m going to give it a shot. At the end of this post, I’m going to ask some questions - in case you want to just skip straight to those.  \n\nI’m AFAB, 28 years old, and I’ve been part of the queer community/out as queer for 11 years now. I\'ve had complicated feelings about my gender for about the same amount of time. My gender (and my sexuality) have always kind of felt like moving, shifting things, but that hasn\'t stopped me from trying to pin them down or make them stay still. \n \nI\'ve employed a number of strategies to that end, some of which involved ways of identifying or taking up labels, and some of which involved more material actions, like disavowing makeup for a period of time, or, alternatively, embracing makeup fully and wearing it every day. It usually works for a while and I feel stable in my identity, until things shift again.\n\nIn recognition of this, I’ve been identifying these days as gender fluid, and also genderqueer and non-binary (although I think claiming those identities for myself feels a bit more scary, for a few reasons). I’ve also felt some resonance with the terms bi-gender and androgyne. \n\nI\'ve tried a number of times to get comfortable in the identity of Femme, because a) I think a lot of people assume that\'s how I identify, and it would make sense to a large degree. I have and continue to present in a way that many people would consider feminine. I often wear mascara, I don\'t often bind, right now I have long hair (it\'s a mullet - ha!), and (I think this is key) all those things on a body that was assigned female at birth are interpreted as feminine, or as femme. And b) I\'ve wanted to identify as femme because I think that for a lot of other people, genderfluid and genderqueer people included, femme feels like a constant, a home, something they can always come back to, an undercurrent that\'s always there. That seems very appealing to me. I would like to have that. But while I\'m arguably femme-presenting, I just can\'t seem to make Femme fit for myself. \n\nMostly the strategy I\'ve used to deal with my unwieldy identity has been to try not to think about it. That has seemed easier than trying to figure out what\'s going on with me, much less trying to put words to it. I haven\'t really had the words. Until recently, it hadn\'t occurred to me that someone femme/femme-presenting who was assigned female at birth could identify as non-binary. The first time I read about it, I was like ""Oh. Ohhhh. Oh fuck."" Surprise, then resonance. And then dread, on some level... It felt a bit like opening a huge can of worms. I had come across an article by Sam Escobar - have any of you come across them in your internet wanderings? They’re an editor at Allure magazine… Anyway, I’ll link to some of the articles I read at the end of my post.  \n\nI think another factor that prevented me from coming to understand myself as non-binary or genderqueer was the relationship I had been in. I spent the better part of 10 years in a relationship wherein there wasn\'t space for me in any kind of meaningful or safe way - not my feelings, not my identity, especially if those things were contrary or threatening to my partner\'s. It was part of an overarching theme/power imbalance in that relationship, that resulted in the focus always coming to rest on my partner and his identity and his gender.

I've looked online for help, but there seems to be very little support in the transgender community for people like me who can't transition (but want to) or people who choose to not transition. I've started seeing a therapist, but he says it will be 2-4 sessions before he will decide on treatment.

So I thought maybe I'd ask here if anyone has any ideas or suggestions. Even though I don't identify as genderqueer, I thought maybe people here would have some suggestions on how I can smooth out some of my maleness (internally or externally without rousing scrutiny).

I've started shaving my body hair. I'm not interested in wearing perfume or painting my nails (2 suggestions when I asked on /r/asktransgender).

2017-10-19 01:14:23,77b78l,19,20,"Hello everyone!!!


Months ago I decided to stopped my MtF hrt because it wasn't making me feel better with myself,indeed,it made feel emotionally the worst I've ever felt,I knew it wasn't the right path for me because I was missing so bad my old appearance and I wasn't feeling related to the new body I was achieving so after a huge emotional collapse I stopped totally my hrt.

Nowadays I still feel great about keep presenting as a guy,I'm getting my beard back and I like it a lot (even if my family thinks is weird to see me with beard again),I'm working out so I'm building a nice body, I mean, I have no body dysphoria at all,I like my whole body,also I'm ok with my gender role (I don't fit in all ""male"" groups but...whatever)I don't care to be called Mr,young man,dude,guy,etcetera anymore so, I'm totally fine living my life as a guy.

》The main situation is: Now, I feel so great about being a guy and I have no dysphoria at all but in some of the happiest moments or the most calmed, relaxing situations I always ask myself in my head...-Would I have been happier if I had not stopped my hrt? I would've been way happier if I would've been born physically a woman- 

Mostly in every situation I'm going through, I think it would have been better living it as a woman,but  if I try to picture myself as a trans girl now,I can't do it.

What does that mean? I have no dysphoria, I don't feel trans,I like being a man but why I keep thinking that way?
 It's been a couple of weeks with that thought so today I decided to take some of the pills I kept and I felt so happy for taking them over again...what is wrong with me??? I don't want to reduce my male characteristics and obviously hrt will do.

Am I a trans girl even if I'm so ok whith being a man?

I'm not gonna lie,I would have loved having been born physically a woman,but I'm ok with being a man now,although every time someone ask me for example what artists I would like to be or look alike,I always say female celebrities names...does that mean something? 

I remember all those trans women telling me that I'm not a cis guy,I never were and never will,because cis guys don't ask themselves about their gender and even start hrt. That I'll always be trans,that I will end up taking hrt again ,I'm so afraid it will be true. 

I thought I was genderqueer or genderfluid but now I just feel as a cis average guy....what do you guys think??? Is it wrong to start taking my old hrt  pills over again even if I'm totally ok about being a guy?

Besides, it is too hard for me to see myself in a gay relationship, I always see myself in the ""woman's side"" when I see a couple,but I'm not a feminine gay guy.


Thanks for reading.

I'm not really sure if this is the right place to post this or not but I'm not really sure where else to go and I don't really know anyone in my life who can relate. 

Quick disclaimer and a little background; everyone in my life is super accepting and awesome. I'm a bi female which I realised years ago and everyone knows; I have a gay brother and my parents are more than supportive and honestly the best parents somebody could hope for. I have a lot of gay/bi friends and honestly don't think any of my friends are homophobic or transphobic at all. However if myself or anyone in my story does come across as intolerant it's probably just confusion of the situation and a lack of knowing anyone going through a similar thing so not fully understanding. 

So recently I've been thinking i might be gender fluid. I'm super confused and have loads of questions and just thoughts and I apologise if this is just sort of ranting. 

So some background, I've always sort of been a mixture of tomboy and girly, like I've never really fit in with either. I'm not sporty or into makeup (I know these are stereotypes but it's just sort of a good example?). In high school I went through stages of loving dresses and nothing else and times when I wore nothing but men's clothing. There was definitely a year or two when I did question my gender but realised I do enjoy being a girl so I couldn't be a guy (didn't really think about other options hahah). 

So what got me thinking about it this time was about a month ago (I know it's not that long) my mum asked me about which I would chose if I could come back in another life as a male or female. She said female and I argued male, because as much as I love being a woman I'd love to see the other side of things, plus don't you have those days when you just feel like a male? She just looked at me confused and said no I don't have those days (again not judging just confused). This got me thinking about my gender for the first time in a while and I was like wait do people not have those days when they want to be a boy? I thought everyone had that. 
The next dayI had an event to go to where I needed to wear a dress and it got me all anxious and nervous and so I was messaging a friend just ranting and saying how I don't feel like wearing a dress and why are my boobs here I just want them to go away. She responded confused like what do you mean, your boobs are awesome? I said yeah some days I do really love them but I'm just having one of those times when I don't want them there at all. She was confused and saying how no she'd never felt that. I too was confused, again asking doesn't everyone just have those days and these thoughts?? 
Later that week after I'd been thinking about these things, I was dressed in baggy pants and a T with some friends who were loving how androgynous I look and I was like yeah I feel like a boy it's awesome. Then a friend said half jokingly something like 'why aren't you just non binary' and it was like everything in my life just clicked. Yes actually that does sound kind of right. That would explain a lot. Is that me? 

It explains why I have days feeling like a male when others don't feel that. Or why I feel like my breasts don't belong on my body sometimes; or why when everyone looked at models and felt bad about themselves I loved my androgynous look and didn't care for a typical female body (or one at all?) I always wanted to grow a beard, and Is my penis envy just about being able to pee wherever or is there more to it? 

I then went into full panic mode for about a week. I know nothing about this, what does it mean? Who even am I now?? 
I started reading a bunch of non binary blogs and definitions and just whatever I could find and felt like gender fluid fit me the best. Some days female, some days male, some days in between. Yep that basically sums up my whole life and why one day I hate hate hate dresses and heels and the next I'm like this is so fun I feel so fancy! 

But now I'm just sort of stuck and lost. I'm not sure what I'm meant to do now? What I'm meant to think about to know if this is right or if not why am I having these thoughts?

Everything has suddenly become harder too, a month ago I got up felt like a dress and put it on and it was great; or felt like baggy pants and an oversize shirt and loved the occasional questioning look I got. I'd be out and knew I looked like a boy but it didn't matter. Now I go out and I'm sort of trying to actually pull of being a boy, like I want people to think that and then suddenly I feel weird when people know I'm a girl, or I feel weird because I go to the female bathrooms and I'm trying to be a boy? 
In some ways it's been freeing like I've been wearing a sports bra with this singlet over and makes me so flat chested and I feel amazing, but then at the same time I'm nervous to run into somebody cos I look like a boy, even though it's exactly how I dressed before??  

I know a lot of what I've been saying has been related to clothing and I get that that isn't what defines genderqueer or trans people but it's been when getting dressed that I've felt most these things.  

Ive spoken to a couple friends who were all like yeah you're only just thinking this? (I seriously thought everyone had these thoughts and I never second guessed the actual thoughts!) 

I don't know what I'm meant to do from here either. My friends either are or will be supportive but they can only really listen not offer help. I messaged this friend of a friend who I've meet a couple times who has some genderqueer friends and she said we could all meet as a group but I'm not sure if any are (female at birth? Is that a correct term? I don't wanna be offensive and nothing against males at birth I just want somebody who fully gets everything like chest dysphoria). 
I just feel so clueless and lost. I thought I knew who I was and now I don't know how to dress myself or present myself and my anxiety is going though the roof, like it has not been this bad in two years. 
Im having so many new thoughts and feelings; the other day I was putting a skirt on and I felt like I was a boy who was dressing as a girl but wanted to dress as a girl. That's definitely a new feeling. 

I don't know if I've really asked a question or if any of this is even coherent and I'm not sure what I'm really looking for. I guess just general advice or maybe I just needed a place to let this all out. I'm not sure. But any response is appreciated and thanks so much to anyone who read all the way to the end. 
Thanks everyone for support!

2017-10-23 02:28:01,784snw,13,13,"Not sure how redundant this exact post is, but here goes...

Let me start off with what I know: I know I have a penis, I know I have a girlfriend who I am extremely romantically and sexually attracted to, I know I'm comfortable with male pronouns, and i know I've had no quarrels with being cisgender for my entire 17 year life so far (up until this point). 

However, I also know that I have a desire to adopt feminine aesthetics (paint nails, wear makeup), I know I am intrigued by and not at all uncomfortable with sexual experiences involving other men, I know while masculinity can feel natural to me it can also feel like a false version of me at times, and that femininity usually excites me and makes me feel like I'm really showcasing myself. I also know that for years and years I always have jumped at the chance to do feminine or at least not traditionally masculine things... *""ironically""*. For me, male-ness is comfortable but also female-ness is empowering.

Now here is what I don't know: I obviously still feel pretty natural following a plethora of male social structures, so is this a sign that at the end of the day I am still a cisgender person who just likes 'girly stuff', OR is my comfort in manhood only a result of me being told and accepting that I'm a guy that will do guy stuff because of my chromosomes/dick for my entire life? I know for sure that femininity is a big part of who I am deep down, but I guess the confusion comes from: am i just a girly cisgender or does this really mean something? 

I'll end this by saying that to be completely honest I really feel like I may be genderqueer, but I think the newness of this becoming a question I am *actually* asking myself is scaring me off. Almost like I'm doubting myself because ""oh if you were *really* genderqueer you would've figured it out by now.""

I am 31, AMAB, and from West Lancashire, United Kingdom.

I want to tell them that I am genderfluid [I live at home with my parents] but currently am unsure of the best way to discuss it with them.

I have Asperger's Syndrome, which may or may not be relevant to this issue.

As it is, I've been taking being genderfluid very slowly.

Some things are certain with my genderfluidity - I'm still attracted to women, and largely feminine-looking/girly-girl-type women, same as when I am male. I'm also not likely to treat my birth name as a dead name, but my female name [when/if I've chosen one] as a secondary name.

In terms of pronouns, I use he when I'm as my normal AMAB self, she when presenting as female, rather than they/them which sounds third-person [for me, anyway] - if it works for others, that's OK, but it's not for me.

I don't want to do a big coming-out related talk to them [isn't that the stereotype of coming out] but equally it's not something I can just drop into conversation. 

I haven't told friends or co-workers about this, but they don't need to know, even though my workplace has a good equality policy [I can't really talk much about my work for reasons relating to Data Protection Act 1998, other than to say I work with disabled adults and do paperwork regarding this].

I don't want them to think I'm transgender or a ""drag queen"" stereotype, but equally, I want to try and be sensitive about this issue.

My parents are accepting of most things, but I do have uncertainties about how to tell them in a good way.

I can't move out for financial reasons and because I haven't quite got the life skills to cope with living away from home permanently. [this partially relates to my point on Asperger's Syndrome, above].

I would appreciate any advice and suggestions on this.",genderqueer,How and when should I tell my parents about my genderfluidity?,1508980660.0,"{'created_utc': 1508955460, 'id': '78pl46', 'num_comments': 8, 'score': 16, 'selftext': 'Thank you for your advice [last time when I asked about looking androgynous](https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/6x2sgv/how_to_find_clothing_that_fits_amab_genderfluid/).\n\nI am 31, AMAB, and from West Lancashire, United Kingdom.\n\nI want to tell them that I am genderfluid [I live at home with my parents] but currently am unsure of the best way to discuss it with them.\n\nI have Asperger\'s Syndrome, which may or may not be relevant to this issue.\n\nAs it is, I\'ve been taking being genderfluid very slowly.\n\nSome things are certain with my genderfluidity - I\'m still attracted to women, and largely feminine-looking/girly-girl-type women, same as when I am male.

I recently came out to my parents as genderqueer/nonbinary/exploring my gender identity.  I felt I wanted to let them know I had started this process so it's less of a shock if I need to make medical changes to myself in the future.  My mom was pretty accepting and started using gender neutral pronouns with me and corrected herself for misgendering me ^.^ (I use they/them pronouns).

He works in the STEM fields and sees all kinds of women breaking stereotypes everyday and he's proud of me for graduating with a STEM degree and starting grad school.  While I understand his point, I still can't shake this internal knowledge that I am not female and that that identity makes me feel uncomfortable about my body and my socialization.

#Sexualities:

**Pansexual** -- have never been with a binary female, but have been attracted to women as a teen.  have had 2-3 experiences with one binary female that deeply aroused me but did not lead to sex

**Polysexual** -- if i am not pansexual and it turns out i am not attracted to non binary women, then I am polysexual, due to being attracted to men, being gynesexual (but not necessarily on a non binary woman, on man) and then skoliosexual:

**Skoliosexual** -- i was with a FTM that i was very attracted to.  had his vagina but not his boobs, but had hair on chest and legs that i loved.  so was deeply attracted that mixture.  have never gone all the way with a binary woman so it's hard to say if im pansexual truly.

**Sapiosexual** -- have found myself with military officers that have an intoxicating affect on me that makes me surrender all logic and everything due to the intelligence and power they command.

i also find myself, on the other side, deeply attracted to nerdy girls!  i know that's simple but i actually love the authenticity of girls with no makeup, glasses, maybe some extra pounds, maybe not, but i think it's the sincerity and intelligence they have, but again, i haven't tested this.

**Sociosexual** -- i have desire to have sex while in a relationship with others outside of the relationship typically due to the multiple needs as shown above


****

#Genders

I have high-functioning autism and epilepsy and it's made everything a little different for me.

***

**Gender Fluid / Bi Gender / DemiFlux / Genderflux / Genderqueer / Non-binary** -- II realize that when playing the submissive role with a man, 75% of the time I will literally become a woman.  i am no longer a man.  25% of the time i submit as a man to another man.  homosexual submission, homosexual domination, and then either transgender/heterosexual domination are the three types of sex i seek out and im trying to identify how my gender plays into these desires.

***

**Gender Non-comformity / Gender variant / Two Spirit** -- very emotional but do not need emotions to have sexual relationships, but find myself very in touch with my emotional side in a feminine way, easy to cry, but i have a full beard, keep all my natural body hair and generally love masculine values even if i am not a traditional man in any way imaginable.... im almost lumbersexual but not with the fashion, just in attitude.  but i have epilepsy so my hands shake.  

**Genderpunk** -- i know it sounds stupid but i really love listening to music that gay men or women would enjoy and in the area i live that means really sharing an intimate side of your identity (and ultimately exposing you as very effeminate).  and lately i feel empowered to sing along because i feel it's deeper than anything, i feel like im connecting with the soul of the musician.  like it just goes so much deeper than anything and in singing and connecting with the effeminate (or sometimes excessively masculine, like in rap or even metal).  for me this always felt very punk in this way i couldn't describe till now

***

**Aliagender / Aporagender** -- XEN -- i am a SPIRIT, beyond man and woman.... when im in this place i am asexual.  then outside of this headspace i encompass some aspects of both man and woman (That last part is my personal understanding of it, but it is not what you would describe the definition as, yet having your own personal definition is the definition itself of alia/apora/gender -- as long as it is a powerful gender-based force)

****

#Conclusions

**Poly Gender / Quad gender** -- the above sections could just mean im polygender: 

part aporagender, 

part gender fluid, 

part gender variant/gender punk, 

part male

I have been wearing it under my regular stuff; I don't know how to describe the feeling other than peaceful, like all of the sudden my world, is a little more OK. \n\nI almost want to cry; I wish I could tell more people, I feel amazingly more comfortable in my skin. I did not know that something so small could mean so much.\n\nI think I have come around to non-binary or gender-queer, I still think I am around 70% male, 30% female. \n\nI hope everyone is doing well; I am grateful to be here.
