What I am, however, considering is a vacation a few hours from where I live, in another state, come warmer weather. Basically, spend at least a couple days living as ""woman me."" Wake up? Go out to eat? Go shopping? Go to the beach? All of this as woman me.

I feel like the only way I'll know for sure if I will actually prefer being a woman over being a man is to, well, not be a man for a few days.

For more context I am low dose HRT for 1hr+. I have long curly hair and wear androgynous cloths with a naked face (or minimal powder to deal with shadow) while at work. i get read m about 70% and f 30% though higher with the young ones, cause they know ;) 

I have made the choice at this point in my job lyf to not correct families or make explicit what pronouns they should be using for me. Thus about once a month i get the ""What are you? Are you a man or women?/etc"" from some child, and usually with their family in the room. 
While on the street i pay this type of shit no lip-service, but at work in my role as a support person I choose to give them gentle responses.

I tend to responded with:
""I am a women"" (the keep it simple option, though this tends to lead to but you sound like a man.)
""I am neither a man or a women."" (This I use less often partly out of internalized fear how the family will respond) 
Or I try to divert the conversation in some way. 

But anyone out there have other suggestions? 

I also tend to struggle when people dont bring it up directly but I can see younger siblings who are in on the appoint whisper and pointing at me together. Those moments i tend to just have to take a deep breath and focus on what I was doing.

2017-02-02 06:51:18,5rlbnv,24,8,"I never really cared about clothing or fashion before, but now I am starting to be more interested in slimmer tighter clothing and lighter colors which are typically for women's clothing only. I noticed a lot of men's clothing is loose, baggy and bulky. In some cases its not even as warm. I actually have plenty of clothes but I don't really like them anymore since they are mostly too loose or too big. My experience with women's clothes is rather limited right now I am really into Uniqlo so I will use that as an example. I have heattech turtleneck shirts in mens and womens in medium size, the womens shirt is noticeably much smaller (and shorter) but a nice snug fit maybe I could have gone with men's small instead. And I also have the heattech mens and women's long johns and leggings in medium. Oddly enough the leggings is actually bigger than the long johns in every way, longer, wider, and looser. Which puzzles me because the waist measurement on their website says men's medium is 30-33 inch waist, women's medium is 28-29 inch waist, yet the women's leggings waistline is actually bigger. those are two specific examples but it seems I would have to size up for tops, and size down for bottoms? I don't think I need another jacket but this one looks very appealing. it's slim, has a neckguard, and cute furry hood.

https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/women-lightweight-down-hooded-coat-178934.html

Do I just go inside the store and see if I can fit in one? I am already getting grief for wearing the long johns and leggings. my family doesn't know the leggings are for women, but their complaint is my pants are too tight. and tell me to cover up with looser pants. But they also complain about my beard. it seems their standards for male appearance is very narrow.

Right now I mostly order stuff online because Uniqlo is far from me but also because I feel embarrassed browsing in the women's section let alone trying the clothes on! I don't even like wearing jeans but suddenly have the urge to get the skintight women's jeans. Men's tapered jeans don't even look tight enough. I did order a pair of jeggings medium size. I assume it will have same fit as the heattech leggings. but for actual jeans I would have to go in the store to find out my size. But no rush since that would be summer clothes. There is a gap nearby but seems pricy. and there is a kohls and numerous discount clothing stores but I am afraid that clothing is too low quality? And oops looks like I wrote way too much.

Update: I went and tried on some women's skinny jeans at GAP and Marshall's. GAP there was like 5 customers must be the high prices got 2 jeans for 50% off (Well buy 1 and get 1 free). only tried the women's stretch skinny jeans at GAP. I noticed one woman stopped walking and turned around to stare at me browsing the women's jeans section. That made me a little nervous. The fitting room attendant probably didn't notice what kind of jeans I was holding. Staff was nice. Then for Marshall's I grabbed a bunch of jeans of different genders, colors, sizes and brands. All skinny, except one was straight. I was way more nervous this time because the store was packed with customers. There were women standing next to me looking at the skinny jeans I was looking at. I did not notice anyone staring at me though. The fitting room attendant had to count how many clothes I had to give me a number badge. I doubt she did not notice I was holding mostly women jeans well she did not say anything. Levi's mens jeans was way too tight could not even pull up the zipper. I tried size 29 and 31. women's calvin klein size 6 was a snug fit, anne klein (any relation lol?) size 4, 10 both fit. The size 4 felt like the calvin klein size 6, I suspect the anne klein has some vanity sizing. there was a size 10 anne klein straight fit, and it looked like regular men's slim fit with some baggage.

Levi's size 31 is 29 1/2 – 30 1/2"" according to Levi website. Anne Klein size 10 is 30″ according to nordstrom website. Oh well. I found some nice jeans that fit me well. they also have deeper pockets than GAP jeans but the stitching looks a bit sloppier.

Now, considering I live about halfway between Atlanta and the Georgia-Alabama line in the SE US, you can see where I am near. I want this trip to be somewhere with a beach. The closest three options I can see as ""getting there in a day without feeling like I have to travel the whole thing in one go"" are Charleston, SC, Tybee Island, GA, and Panama City Beach, FL.

Now, you might be wondering why I picked those three, they have beaches. I am not opposed to vacation spots without beaches that may be in similar (or even less) distance, like a Chattanooga, TN. Basically, anywhere less than about 4 hours from the metro Atlanta area, give or take a half-hour of travel difference. The big attraction beaches have to me, however, is that this trip is being formulated for a time in late spring/early summer.

The main reason I am so heavily focused on the beach spots, I already have a bikini that I think I look pretty good in, and would like to actually get some use out of it this year.

Now, a cheap hotel or airbnb spot with a pool would work as well, and if the trip to that spot was, say, an hour and a half to two hours away, instead of three and a half to four and a half hours, I'd probably like the idea a LOT better, it's just that I somehow imagine a major tourist spot like a beach being a bit more LGBT friendly, even in the south.

So, given less than four and a half hours driving straight from the Atlanta area, a reasonably modern feeling area, access to inexpensive lodging options (think really budget friendly), and reasonably friendly to LGBT types, particularly trans people who haven't started transitioning, where would you recommend?",genderqueer,Need advice on LGBT-friendly travel destinations.,1486132211.0,"{'created_utc': 1486107011, 'id': '5rsleh', 'num_comments': 4, 'score': 15, 'selftext': 'Okay, as mentioned in [another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/5rhd61/exploring_taking_a_vacation_as_my_potential/) I am toying with the idea of a ""girl vacation"" where I spend as close to 0% of the time as possible as a guy.

2017-02-06 21:18:49,5sh01u,13,13,"Hey y'all!

I've been going through a round of self-rediscovery and during that process I discovered I was genderfluid/genderqueer. I know they're umbrella terms but the part of the definitions that fit me are where it says ""a person feels they have both male and female genders inside"". This is exactly how I feel. I've been looking at some videos on Youtube and I've learned a lot. For instance, I wake up in the morning and based on how I feel (boy mode or girl mode) that's how I dress for the day. My sex is male and I am very comfortable being male and I do not wish to transgress to a female sex. When I'm in girl mode, I like to express it through the way I dress.

What makes me feel this way/How did I discover this? Well, I've known I was gay ever since I was six. I didn't know what it was at the time, all I knew was that I liked boys a lot better than girls. This was also back in the late 70's to early 80's back when the ""internet"" was still a private network and the accessibility to information wasn't as easy as it is now. My gayness was something I put in a jar and put on a shelf for later reinspection. Years passed by and I grew up and came out of the closet. I didn't rediscover the genderqueer jar until about eight months ago while going through a round of talk-therapy. I needed to clean out the closet so to speak, confront and resolve some things from my past and file them away so I can continue moving forward with my life. While doing this I found this jar, blew the dust off of it and opened it up and looked inside.

I remember some things from my childhood that the typical boy wouldn't do. One of the funnier moments I remember was I was about 4 years old and I was at Kmart with my Mom. I'd always go look at the toys while she shopped and she would come get me before she checked out. She came and got me one day and I had a tea set in my hand. She didn't want to get it for me until I threw a hissyfit in the store for it. She put it in the cart and off to the register we went. I wasn't allowed to play with it while my dad was at home (for obvious reason, growing up in the rural south has its perks sometimes), but I had the best of times having my tea parties with my imaginary friends. Something else I remember, I grew up in the 80's. The 80's were great! Everyone was all coked to the gills and money was flowing around like water. The fashions and hairstyles were oh so rad! I remember having an aunt and a female cousin who ""partook"" in the 80's life. They never did any drugs that I knew of but I remember loving their outfits when I was a kid and wanting something similar for myself. I was so thrilled the first time I got a pair of parachute pants!

Moving along like the hands of time always do, I'm starting to explore this new side of my personality and I have to tell you this is the happiest I've ever been in my life. I've only got a handfull of skirts and tights because I'm just getting started in this but I cannot wait until my wardrobe gets bigger. It's kind of an irony in my life because I like to live a very minimalist lifestyle but my wardrobe is exploding! I'm designing a new tinyhouse and I can't believe that I'm actually adding a closet so I can hang dresses and skirts in. I have an imgur account that I've got a few pictures if you'd like to take a looksee at [bennetfox.imgur.com](http://bennetfox.imgur.com). I'm going to add more pictures as time progresses because I'd like to see how this evolves over time.

There are a couple things that I've learned that I don;t like. You see, my style is ""athleisure"". I like to wear sports apparel casually and one of my favorite outfits is a pleated cheer skirt and an Adidas hoody. I'm not into the hair or makeup but I do enjoy painting my fingernails. Right now they are hot tamale orange and I really like the color. I can't do hair or makeup because I an an albino and I am functionally blind. I can't see myself clearly enough in the mirror to put on makeup and do my hair every day although I would love to grow my hair long enough so I can do a small ponytail or pigtails. I don't think I can get into wigs either. The problem with wigs and makeup is it's like the person is trying to disguise something. Please don't take offense to that because I don't mean it that way. I don't really like makeup on women either for generally the same reasons. I understand people do it to make themselves feel good and that's great, that's just not me. I prefer short hair because I really enjoy dying it fun bright colors. I've got the white base to start with and it takes color so well!

The other thing I don't like is being called a ""crossdresser"". I know I said I'm comfortable with my male sex, but I am not a crossdresser. Unfortunately that word has some very negative connotations that I do not want to discuss here.

So anyways, I have some questions that I'd like to ask you:

* How did you discover that you were genderqueer/genderfluid?
How did everyone around you react to it? did you get responses from people you didn't expect and did you not get responses from people you expected to respond?

* Got any pictures of boy mode/girl mode?
Is your family in on the loop? Are they supportive or did they drop you like a bad habit?
* And finally, the restroom. Which one do you use? Have you gotten any strange or weird looks/comments while in there?

I really thank y'all for reading this. It's a long process and I'm taking it really slow and figuring out things along the way and I love having the group help and support that I get from reading the LGBTQ reddits. Hugs to everyone and y'all have a great day!

I am an 18 year old male. I've always been comfortable being a male. I am by no means the stereotipical boy who likes playing football and cars but I still feel very comfortable being male. I have a wonderful girlfriend which I love very much and it feels natural to be the male partner of the couple. Yet I'd also love to be a female. Not a mix of the two thing but rather be able to switch between one and the other whenever I feel like it. I would like to be able to wear a dress and high heels like I like to wear a tie for example.
Very often when I was at home by myself (I don't live there anymore) I would go into my sister's room and dress up as a woman and it felt natural, just like it feels natural to be male. I would use socks to make the breasts, use a wig, put on a dress that would not show too much of my male body of course and high heels. Whenever I did that, I, for some reason I don't know, got an erection.
Also I spent hours watching videos of other boys transforming themselves into girls using makeup and other things.
Very often I would also dream about being a female in various occasions. I would also fantasize about it in my head.

2017-02-07 18:45:37,5sn86u,10,3,"Hey everyone Sorry in advance for a probably long post! 

As long as I can remember ive not felt ""comfortable"" in my own skin... I get anxiety and panic attacks, and generally haven't been that fond of myself for lost of my life. 

Over the last few months, I've begun to notice that a lot of the things (physically) I dislike and cause discomfort are traits that distinctly categorise me as male/masculine, some of which I didn't even realise we're gender specific (the weird eyebrow lump thing/flat bit for example). 

Although I am 30 yrs old, Amab, and in a long term relationship with a cis female, I have never strongly associated with the concept of ""maleness"". It just seems a strange concept to me and growing up I never really fitted in with the whole Lad/Bro culture thing.

Having done some research here and other places (thanks everyone!) Im beginning to think that at least some of the issues I've had for years stem fr something a bit like  dysphoria... Or at least feeling freaked out and upset by stuff which makes me appear more ""male""...Which it feels weird to say, I wouldn't have believed I feel ""Sick enough"" with it to count as dysphoric in that until recently... And im still not sure I do.

Anyway, the more I thought about it the more I began to think that I've been sort of ""self treating"" for quite a while. I've been gradually removing more and more of my body hair for the last couple of years...almost always through some kind of freak out where it's been the only thing that's helped me feel better. I've been shaving my full legs for the last couple of months, and started using a home laser as well and that's really helped. I also got two ridiculously skinny long t shirts which fit like t shirt dresses, shaped my eyebrows and started wearing tinted primer as a skin base. 

In terms of self description and expression.... Im drawn to the whole androgyne/androgynous thing. I don't remember ever feeling male, but I'm pretty sure I haven't ever felt fully female either.

I'm pretty sure that stuff will continue to be hard and confusing (dunno if I'd be into HRT in the future for example?!) but everyone has to start somewhere right?

Any tips for feeling better, more androgynous or just advice about dealing with gender issues in general would be super welcome!

TL;DR: Assigned male at birth, have always been ""feminine"" in appearance and taste, and hit puberty late. Looking for ways to appear less ""masculine"". 

So I'm 19 and a ""late bloomer"" apparently. Always considered myself a cis gay guy, but then over the course of a few months starting at the end of last summer, I grew 6 inches, my shoulders got really broad, I got pecs, and my voice DROPPED like crazy.

So I'm officially freaked out, because none of this feels right; it's getting harder and harder to appear androgynous, especially on a university student's budget. My body is suddenly ""masculine"" and I feel like I'm experiencing something like the dysphoria my trans friends experience. 
So, does anyone know any good tips or tricks for looking tastefully androgynous? I'm really good with makeup, and my hair is long-ish... Women's clothes are harder to find in my sizes now, and they look kinda silly on my shoulders now. I'm at the point of possibly trying to get on estrogen? The physical frustration is driving me crazy and messing up my life a little bit. Are there over-the-counter ways to naturally increase estrogen in a way that's physically noticeable?

So I have a probably very complex question to you all: how do you define gender?

I'm asking because as someone who is just starting to figure out their gender (all I know is I don't feel like a cis girl) I encountered quite a few people within the nonbinary community who simply dismiss how I identify based on the fact that I can't put a label on my gender yet.

*Edits are for grammar and formatting*

&amp;nbsp;

I’ve lived in this house all my life.  My parents moved out some time ago and left it to me, though they still come and visit sometimes.  It’s a nice house.  Large and spacious, there’s plenty of room for my “memories,” items ranging from tiny to wall-covering, all depicting moments of my life.  Some of these are uninteresting, and some are cherished.  I make new memories every day in my workshop.  Some would call me a hoarder.  They might be right, but I don’t mind.  I can pick up anything and remember what it means.  This was perfect living; a man in his house.

&amp;nbsp;

When I’m not playing video games, I will sometimes wander through my house to find things that I’d forgotten, things that remind me of something long in the past.  About a month ago, I came across something I’d never seen before.  I found the floorplan to the house.  It didn’t really make sense to me.  It looked like it showed a room that I’d never seen before, and it had no doors.  I thought it was probably not the final draft.  Reminded of nothing, I put it back where I found it.

&amp;nbsp;

I kept looking through to find something I’d forgotten.  Sometimes, when I do this, I’ll get a glance of my shadow, and it will look rather strange for a split second, like it’s not even mine.  Nothing is different about it, though.  It was probably just a trick of the light.  It happened again on that same day.  This time, however, I just kept looking at it, and though it was clearly me, it still didn’t feel right.

&amp;nbsp;

It felt like I needed a different shadow.

&amp;nbsp;

After maybe ten seconds, I looked away and kept browsing my house.  I passed a wall, and something about it caught my eye.  It was exactly where I remember a wall on the floorplan, one of the walls on the missing room.  I walked around it and found two of the other four walls: one in the kitchen and one in a hallway.  The fourth wall was under the staircase, just as in the floorplan.  I walked up to the first wall, pushed aside a large model of a lighthouse, and stared at my shadow, which fell right on the wall.  I don’t know why, but my heart was pumping.  Taking one more step, something compelled me to knock, so I did.  Nothing happened at first, but as I walked away, I heard another knock.  I thought that something inside probably fell off the wall.

&amp;nbsp;

The next day, I happened to be walking past that room again.  I heard another knock.  I thought I had probably stepped on the floor hard enough to knock something else off the wall inside.  That didn’t make sense, however, as that should have happened sometime before, but it never had.  I walked up again, my shadow staring at me just as it had the day before, and listened with my ear on the wall.

&amp;nbsp;

*Knock*

&amp;nbsp;

It was exactly where my ear was.  Nothing fell off.  The noise was on the wall itself.

&amp;nbsp;

*Knock*

&amp;nbsp;

It was a little louder that time.

&amp;nbsp;

*Sniff*

&amp;nbsp;

I just about died.  The sniff was loud enough for me to hear on my side.  I ran to my workshop, grabbed a hammer and my dad’s old machete—I didn’t know what was in there—and ran back.

&amp;nbsp;

*BANG BANG BANG*

&amp;nbsp;

I heard it again.  I was terrified.  I did not know what was going to happen.  Someone, or something, was in my house, though, and I had to find out who or what.

&amp;nbsp;

So I tore open the wall.

&amp;nbsp;

With a gaping hole about torso-height letting the air exchange, odd currents drifted the dust this way and that, and as it cleared, I saw a face between the studs.  It was eerily familiar.

&amp;nbsp;

I thought I was looking in a mirror.

&amp;nbsp;

After a few seconds, I did see differences.  The face was gaunt and lean, with long, long hair.  I realized shortly that this person, looking at me with wonder and fright, had no facial hair.  There was not even stubble; not a whisker.  As similar as this person looked to me, I realized that she was female, and she had tears streaming down her face.  I tore the wall down, all the way down to the floor.  She was skin and bones, wearing clothing that looked just like mine from when I was thirteen.  I waved her out with a smile, and slowly walking through the hole, she turned toward the hallway and started slowly, then sped up almost to a run toward the kitchen.

&amp;nbsp;

She knew where everything was.  She grabbed a large serving bowl, poured out all the cereal I had left in a box and almost an entire gallon of milk, and just dived right in.  Once she had eaten for a couple minutes, she grabbed some towels and cleaned up her mess.  She wasn’t finished eating, though.  She got a spoon from the drawer.  No one new has ever gotten that drawer right the first time, but she knew exactly where it was.  I just stood there in shock.  Who was she?  What was she doing there?

&amp;nbsp;

Why did she have my eyes?

&amp;nbsp;

Strangely, as she ate, I felt like I had more energy.  I thought it was probably left-over adrenalin.  I let her keep eating.  She found the lunch meat, and after she had finished a new package, she sat down, looked at me, and gave me a big, wide smile with eyes—my eyes—that seemed to glow with joy.

&amp;nbsp;

Her smile looked like my mother’s.

&amp;nbsp;

She didn’t say anything at first, but as I talked to her over a couple weeks, she quickly got a voice.  I don’t know if she couldn’t speak or didn’t want to, but now she’s talking as if she never had a problem.  I’ve been giving her my clothes to wear, though she doesn’t like them much.  I also cut her hair so it was down slightly past her shoulders, and I got it untangled.  I did strangely well.  Maybe I should have been a barber.  Her hair, though, had just the same texture and color as mine.  I thought she was probably a twin.  I had no idea why she was in that room, or why my parents never told me about her.

&amp;nbsp;

She’s much healthier now.  She even gives me energy which I haven’t known since I was a child.  In my curiosity, though, I watched her.  I wasn’t creepy about it, I just observed what she liked to do, which just so happened to be my hobbies.  Strangely, though, she never did anything in my workshop.  She did, however, pick up video games very quickly.  I realize now, actually, I had been doing less of my own things.  I spend more time in my workshop.  She creates enough memories for two people.

&amp;nbsp;

Just today, I saw her playing my favorite video game.  She’s just as good, if not better, than I am.  She offered me my other controller, the blue one.  She was holding the red controller.  I gladly accepted.  I sat down in the chair next to hers and we played a three-vs.-three together.  We were doing great.  We won that match handily, and we got compliments from our two team members.

&amp;nbsp;

Our two team members, in a three-vs.-three.  That’s four people on our team.  I check the player board, and it was just me and those two.  I look in her chair—but it’s gone.  No her, and no chair.  I start to panic a bit.  I glance at my controller as I start to put it down—it's purple.  I don’t have a purple controller.  I have a blue one.  But where did she get the red one?

&amp;nbsp;

Where is she?

&amp;nbsp;

I try to scream her name, but I keep getting my own name stuck in my throat.  I finally just scream my name—I never actually learned hers, I just realized—and something is wrong with my voice.  I need to calm down.

&amp;nbsp;

I bolt up the stairs to see if I can find her in the room I gave her, and I see her in the hallway against a wall, but only as I pass her.  I look at her, and she looks at me.

&amp;nbsp;

I’m looking in a mirror.

&amp;nbsp;

I put up my right hand, and she puts up her left.  We press them against the mirror, and my hand fits perfectly in the same spot as hers.  It should be larger.  In fact, it’s the same hand.  And she’s wearing the same clothes I am.  I look in her eyes, and she looks in mine.  She begins smiling.

&amp;nbsp;

She’s giving me a big, wide smile with eyes that seem to glow with joy.

&amp;nbsp;

I realize I’m smiling.  Smiling brighter than I ever have before.  The girl in the mirror isn’t her.  The girl in the room wasn’t her.  She was me.

&amp;nbsp;

I look at my shadow, and it's perfect.

&amp;nbsp;

The old me of yesterday never disappeared.  She and I are one and the same.  She is no different than I am, and I feel more complete than I ever have.  I finally accepted her into my house.

&amp;nbsp;

Inspired, I decide to go to my workshop and create a new memory.  In a few hours, I finish a small but powerful symbol, a combination of the symbols of Mars and Venus.

##### why I don't like singular, *referential* ""they"" (and don't want people to use it to refer to me)

(aka I'm probably just older than the average GQ person and we know how grumpy old people are about language change! also aka I can't stop linguisting, ever, I'm sorry. **Also I'm not trying to control your language use; do whatever you want!**)


##### Okay, first let's break apart the different uses of singular ""they"".
Taking modified examples from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specificity_(linguistics) as a starting point:

- A. I'm looking for Taylor. Where are they?  &lt;-- definite, specific (The new use of singular ""they"")
- B. I'm looking for the manager. Do you know where I can find them? &lt;-- definite (We presume the existence of a manager), non-specific (I don't know who it is.)
- C. There was a photographer I talked to the last time I was here, but I don't remember too much about them. &lt;-- indefinite (This isn't someone already in your mind.), specific (This is a specific person in my mind.)
- D. It looks like someone left their coat here. &lt;-- indefinite, non-specific


##### As for the interpretations...
I think D and B are quite acceptable uses to pretty much everyone, as long as you're thinking in terms of casual speech (since people argue different things for formal writing).


C, although acceptable, seems to have a suspicious interpretation. Because our culture and language presume that people's gender is one of two things, and that which of these two it is should be obvious, if you say C it seems like you are somehow deliberately *hiding* the gender of the person you're talking about.


A is new, and therefore weird.


Talking about a nonbinary person, Usage C: I have a friend who prefers they/them. We used to date. People look at me and think I'm a woman who dates women. So if I say ""I dated someone for four years. They never wanted to move here,"" people think that I'm hiding my sexuality. And I don't like that interpretation.


Since referential singular ""they"" (A) is also associated with uses B and D, it can sound kind of impersonal in a way.


Anyway that's it. Go back to your fabulous lives. :D


*edit: 

**TL;DR:** I prefer people refer to me as ""he/him"" and not ""they/them."" This has absolutely nothing to do with anyone else's pronoun choice, just mine. (I use ""they/them"" to refer to people who prefer that pronoun set.) I disprefer ""they/them"" for the reasons explained above. I would really like people to know that it's about current word connotations/associations, not some stupid idea of ""correctness.""

2017-02-21 23:13:05,5vey87,3,15,"Hi all. This is a long rambling almost nonsensical post of my barring my thoughts to the sub. Feel free to skip it all, there is a TL;DR below.

Since I was about 18 or 19 I began slowly questioning my gender when I first learned about the different genders. It wasn't something I really had to think about too hard when it came to the concept. There was more than just trans people? Awesome. That's cool.

I remember seeing a partner at the time questioning their identity and having a tough time with it. I remember thinking, ""What about my gender?"" and then, thinking, ""Nah, I'm fine. I'm just a girl, duh."" Yet since then, as I've learned more and more about gender expression and such I've questioned myself more and more. 

I have always, since I was a kid, loved having short hair. My mom has short hair and always has, so I guess I get that from her. 

But for the past few years I keep thinking, ""I like having boy hair."" Fake mohawks like youtuber Markiplier used to have, side swiped like youtuber Lucas, kind of punkish as well. And yet I've dyed my hair pink or purple for the past year. I'm never one to think in strict binary terms but this is confusing for me. 

Lately I'm going through a more masculine phase, even going to far as to ask my friend to call me Zack and he/him pronouns, then subsequently questioning if I even like that name for myself. 

So faced with this maze of revolving doors that is my identity I have to ask, is it okay to experiment? Can I be Zack one week, Selene the next? Can I be him now and they later and she next year? 

Being female no one cares nowadays (at least in my family) if you wear pants and a tie with your blouse or want to do a traditionally male oriented job. It's just seen as normal now. Which is good, yet not satisfying to my need to experiment with who I may be. 

For me being bi-gender, or genderfluid, or genderqueer isn't enough. I don't wish I were cis woman or male or anything like that. I just want to find my place on the spectrum. Right now that spectrum isn't a linear bar with an arrow to point where I am or where I want to be as how a spectrum is often represented. 

Gender isn't linear. People aren't linear. 

There's a lot of people who say labels don't matter, or there's no need to put a label on XYZ. But I think labels are okay. Labels help us communicate who we are. And if that label is, no label that's okay too. But for me I don't have a label and I can't communicate who I am because it's constantly changing. 

I'm reminded of the Golden Compass series. I didn't read far into the books, they weren't my thing I guess. But what I remember is that the Daemons (physical representations of the soul/mind IIRC) of children were constantly changing form, trying to find the perfect balance as the person figured out who they were. 

I feel like a Daemon. I'm constantly changing and experimenting with who I am and what I am. I just don't know how to deal with the mental whiplash and being unable to be content.

This is a long rambling almost nonsensical post of my barring my thoughts to the sub. Feel free to skip it all, there is a TL;DR below.\n\nSince I was about 18 or 19 I began slowly questioning my gender when I first learned about the different genders. It wasn\'t something I really had to think about too hard when it came to the concept. There was more than just trans people? Awesome. That\'s cool.\n\nI remember seeing a partner at the time questioning their identity and having a tough time with it. I remember thinking, ""What about my gender?"" and then, thinking, ""Nah, I\'m fine. I\'m just a girl, duh."" Yet since then, as I\'ve learned more and more about gender expression and such I\'ve questioned myself more and more. \n\nI have always, since I was a kid, loved having short hair. My mom has short hair and always has, so I guess I get that from her. \n\nBut for the past few years I keep thinking, ""I like having boy hair."" Fake mohawks like youtuber Markiplier used to have, side swiped like youtuber Lucas, kind of punkish as well. And yet I\'ve dyed my hair pink or purple for the past year. I\'m never one to think in strict binary terms but this is confusing for me. \n\nLately I\'m going through a more masculine phase, even going to far as to ask my friend to call me Zack and he/him pronouns, then subsequently questioning if I even like that name for myself. \n\nSo faced with this maze of revolving doors that is my identity I have to ask, is it okay to experiment? Can I be Zack one week, Selene the next? Can I be him now and they later and she next year? \n\nBeing female no one cares nowadays (at least in my family) if you wear pants and a tie with your blouse or want to do a traditionally male oriented job. It\'s just seen as normal now. Which is good, yet not satisfying to my need to experiment with who I may be. \n\nFor me being bi-gender, or genderfluid, or genderqueer isn\'t enough. I don\'t wish I were cis woman or male or anything like that. I just want to find my place on the spectrum. Right now that spectrum isn\'t a linear bar with an arrow to point where I am or where I want to be as how a spectrum is often represented. \n\nGender isn\'t linear. People aren\'t linear. \n\nThere\'s a lot of people who say labels don\'t matter, or there\'s no need to put a label on XYZ. But I think labels are okay. Labels help us communicate who we are. And if that label is, no label that\'s okay too. But for me I don\'t have a label and I can\'t communicate who I am because it\'s constantly changing. \n\nI\'m reminded of the Golden Compass series. I didn\'t read far into the books, they weren\'t my thing I guess. But what I remember is that the Daemons (physical representations of the soul/mind IIRC) of children were constantly changing form, trying to find the perfect balance as the person figured out who they were. \n\nI feel like a Daemon. I\'m constantly changing and experimenting with who I am and what I am. I just don\'t know how to deal with the mental whiplash and being unable to be content. \n\nTL;DR: I\'m experimenting with my gender identity and having an existential crisis over it. How do I deal?

2017-02-22 03:40:13,5vgebr,11,13,"**tl;dr** I think I'm genderfluid and that surprises me, because I thought I was binary FtM.  I have the option to start T but I'm not sure anymore that it's right.  I'm also really tired, so I'm rambling.  I'm just looking for others to share their experience and thoughts, if they can relate.

Hi all, I've been doing a lot of thinking about myself and a lot of exploration in counseling.  

I have the option to start testosterone (I'm AFAB) but I'm so conflicted that it's probably not a good idea.  At least not ""now"", but I feel like that answer isn't ""never"", but ""now"" is probably the best logistical time.  I am lucky to live in a very LGBT friendly area, but that may not always be the case so if I leave here, I might not feel comfortable getting T or might not have as easy access.  

As far as dysphoria, there are very specific things about my body that I wish I could change to be masculine, but there are feminine things I don't want to lose.

I think I'm genderfluid and it seems to be very context dependent.  I find myself wishing that I could flip a switch and be seen as female when I want, but also as male when I want.  For every upside to T it seems like there's a downside for me.  For example, I *really* wish I could make my voice really deep when I want - to the point that I get wildly dysphoric when hearing deep male voices - but I don't want to lose my ability to speak in a higher register also.  I don't want body hair but I do want facial hair.  When I'm in a group of all men, I want to be seen as ""one of the guys"" but in my romantic relationships (with men) I feel very feminine (and am happy with that).  Etc... it goes on and on.  

And it's not confined to bodily changes, it's also present in my expression.  E.g. I like to bind my chest but also wear lipstick at the same time.  

Currently, I feel like my social transition is complete, to the degree I want it to be.  I am seen as female in all my public activities, for example at work or at the doctor's.  Even when I went to my hormones consult, I insisted that my pronouns were female and my name was my female name.  I want only my close friends and family to know about my male side and call me by that name (and not all the time).  This is not a perfect balance, but it is genuinely what I prefer.

When I first started exploring with having some people call me ""malename"" and use ""him/he"" I was so happy.  But that happiness faded over time and now it's kind of ""meh"".  I still like it sometimes, and request it in some situations, but in others I prefer ""femalename"" and ""she/her"".

The idea that I might be fluid is new to me.  I'd always thought I was a transman, FtM, and that I hated all my femininity.  But when I started exploring, I found that there is a feminine component to me; it's *less* than the masculine component, but I would still hate to lose it.  And I'm starting to think that the volatile mood swings I've coped with all my life might be related to my switching genders, in fact.  

I'm... kind of lost.  The ""standard"" narrative of ""come out, get hormones and maybe surgery, ask everyone to start calling you by a new name"" doesn't seem to fit me, but I don't know what to replace it with.

I was a very typical little girl. I loved dresses, ""girl toys"", shows aimed at girls... I started to feel uncomfortable about my naked body when I was 13 or 14, but I thought it had something to do with my discomfort with sex and me being asexual. Only times I've ever had the typical body image issues cis women have is when my abusive friends shamed me for having small boobs. I was at middle school when I first heard about the concept of ""third gender"". I was intrigued and wondered if I was (or ""could be"") like that, but I dismissed it and continued living as a girl. I also had huge issues with misogyny. Nowadays I'm a feminist and I'm actively trying to get rid of those feelings. I noticed that when I try to think of myself as non-binary or as a guy, I have a lot more positive views on women. I've heard that some trans people have problems with misogyny or misandry, because they're forced to live as that gender and it causes some bitterness. However, I can't remember having any huge problems at being referred as a girl.

I started to seriously question my gender last spring. I started to suppress those thoughts after a few days, but I can't ignore it anymore. Being a girl doesn't feel right anymore. I hate my female body. But the thing is, I was diagnosed with psychosis when I was 16. I have no symptoms anymore thanks to my meds, but I wonder if this could be caused by that?

Anyway, when I first thought myself as non-binary or as a guy, I felt light and free. It felt like I let go of years of suppression. I also received my binder last week. I almost cried when I had it on. It looked so *right*. But something weird also happened. I suddenly loathed my body and my genitals. I was almost disgusted. I put a skirt on so I couldn't see the lack of bulge and pretended that I'm a crossdresser. Is it weird that I love my long hair, my feminine face and wearing skirts and dresses but I also want a male body?

I intended to start suppressing my feelings again and force myself to feel like a woman, until today happened. I couldn't handle my constant confusion and possible dysphoria, so I drank alcohol and ended up self-harming. I haven't done that in a long time, and even when I did, I ""only"" bit myself or poked my arms with scissors. Now I actually took a knife and tried to make myself bleed. First I wanted to feel better, then I wanted to punish myself for being so confused, and then I wanted to punish my body for being female. I even started to feel suicidal again. I stopped and cried, and now I'm feeling a lot better. I'm in therapy and I intend to talk about these feelings there, but I really felt the need to write here.

Hey, so I’m going to give a basic rundown here, for better setup, and so that you can understand my situation better. I'm a guy. A paper white, skinny, tall, male. I’m 14. I’m in 7th grade (I started late and have a summer birthday). The school I’m going to is a catholic school. It’s not so bad. Very accepting. I am an atheist. This isn't what I'm coming out about, but it is kind of important for you to know so that you understand that I'm not at risk of being disowned or hated because of who I am. I'm an atheist and it's not a secret, my parents know it, my friends and peers know it, my teachers know it, hell even the principle knows it. None of them really care. They truly couldn't give a damn, it's just ""whatever"" to them. And this is just how accepting everyone is. My parents are liberal, and as such I knew that they wouldn't be upset. I had thought that my new religious school and classmates would be, but they didn't care, like I said. The teachers, while some of them disagree with it and have their own beliefs as to my judgment, I'm sure, are not persecuting to me about it and don't try to make me repent or feel bad. My friends, don't believe that I will be punished or anything like that. While they are religious, they aren't archaic about it, and most don't even believe in hell. Now, I'm also openly ""not straight"". I'm pansexual. I like everyone. But as far as my friends are concerned I'm just not straight or am just bi. I've asked out 2 girls before (failed both times), and don't try and hide my interest for any of the sexy guys the girls swoon over. I've only ever said that I didn't just like girls. I haven't really told them the label for it, but it doesn't matter. Everyone knows that I'm pansexual, no one really cares, I don't care, it's all great. Except for one issue. Well, more like two actually. My parents. They don't know. I've jsut never really felt up for telling them. I once hinted at it when saying that this would be the year of school in which I'd actually consider dating and going out with someone. I kept it purposefully vague as to the gender. I didn't say I was going to ask girls out or have a boyfriend. They both asked me about that and both said that they loved me and wouldn't mind. I said the same thing to both of them, that with all do respect, it wasn't necessarily their business. And they accepted it and that was it. This was of course before I'd come out about being pansexual to everyone, and still felt a bit timid about people knowing. Okay, I have to make a quick pause. I have a plan. I am coming out. And I'm doing it in a way that I'm proud of and think will work best for me. So I've been writing/drawing these pages with pictures/words on them. It's kind of supposed to be a 'parody' of a kids book, meaning that it kind of has that feel to it, where there's a large picture on every page illustrating the story. In this little book, is my coming out confession. It talks about alot of things. And in the end comes out about the three things I need to come out about. One is the pansexuality and to my parents. The other two I'll talk about after this little pause. I think that this way of coming out will work best for me because I'm a great writer. I talk best through written words than spoken. And this is a way that I can enjoy. Basically, my depression (yeah I have it, it sucks, but that's not what this is about) took away my passion for drawing years ago. And only recently am I getting it back. So the two things I love to do, writing and drawing, are helping me come out. I don't want this to be something I hate. I'm going to come out through words and color. Anyway that's all, quick pause over. The main thing that I'm coming out about, is something I've only told three people. I'm genderfluid. And it really sucks ass. Atleast if your trans, you can try and transition, and then it's all fixed. For me, whether or not I feel like a guy or girl, isn't some stagnant thing. It changes. And it fucking sucks so god damn much. If I could have one wish, that had to be focused solely on me... What I would give to be able to change sex when I feel like it... Anyway, sorry I just, it stinks. It really does. But like I said, only three people know. My bestfriend, I'd trust her with anything. Another friend who is transgender and kind of gets my plight. And then a new friend that I've made this year, I've told her a lot and we're really close. All three of these people that I've told, are all accepting of me. I'm not afraid to come out to my friends, well, I am, but not like a lot. My teachers, I really couldn't give a shit about what they think honestly. My parents, I know that they'd accept it, eventually. But, there's all this confusion going on. There's so many genders and sexualities and some are overly specific, some mean the exact same thing as others, some have multiple meanings that each claim is the right one. It's confusing. I get it. And there's the whole 'Transtrender' bull shit that comes with it. Suddenly everyone isn't just fit neatly into the whole binary area and everyone is different. A lot of people are a bit stigmatic towards all of this. My parents are. I think that if I said that I was genderfluid that they wouldn't take me seriously at first. I think that they would in the end. But perhaps the scariest thing, and the hardest for me to come out about. is wanting to transition. And this is kind of the thing I wanted to talk about. I came to the conclusion girls where better than guys along time ago. I can prove it through anatomy, history, society, a lot of things. While men are stronger then women on average, women can do things men can't. Women can give birth for one (just to be clear I know if I transitioned to a girl I wouldn't be able to give birth, nor would I want to, I can't stand pain and don't want to be a parent). I'll gloss over the fact of how women and orgasms work... And of course women do have to deal with periods, which, just... Respect, okay, respect. In history women have proven to be more accepting and generous. I could go on, but don't feel like it. I've always gotten along with girls slightly better than guys. And I find that if I fantasize about men (which is usually when my genderfluidism appears, sexually) I'm more often the girl with a guy than the guy with another guy. I've given it a lot of thought. And I want to be a girl. I'll be happier being constantly female than constantly male. And I know that at some point I'll begin to feel like a guy, because I'm genderfluid and it changes. But I think I'm okay with that. It's the sacrifice I'll make to be happy. I can't change when I want, so I'll change to what I want most. This is going to be the scariest to com out about. To everyone.
And that's it. That's everything. All I want is some advice. Some opinions on all of this. What I'm going through. What I'm going to do. And most importantly, advice about transitioning. I've tried researching it, but couldn't find anything that answered my questions exactly. I'm going to put a list of questions I have below. This is a really long thing to read. And if you read it all, thank you. Would you be even kinder, and maybe help me out? I don't really have anyone to ask these things or to talk about this stuff with. So, if you do respond and help me.. God, I, I can't say how much it will mean to me. But, if you do, than thank you. Thank you so much.

How does the voice work? I have a deep voice. I've been thinking on it, but this is the only conclusion: If one undergoes transitioning before puberty or during early puberty, their voice won't get deeper and they won't sound like a boy. If one goes through transitioning after puberty or during (to the point where it's to far to matter), than their voice will remain male sounding and they'll have to use a fake voice to sound like a girl. I don't think that's right, it's just what I've pieced together. I really don't want to have to pretend to sound like a girl. So how does it work?

How long will it take? I know that it varies upon age and body and a lot of other things as well. But how long might it take for me?

I was told by another person that this might be a good place to ask as well.\n\nHey, so I’m going to give a basic rundown here, for better setup, and so that you can understand my situation better. I\'m a guy. A paper white, skinny, tall, male. I’m 14. I’m in 7th grade (I started late and have a summer birthday). The school I’m going to is a catholic school. It’s not so bad. Very accepting. I am an atheist. This isn\'t what I\'m coming out about, but it is kind of important for you to know so that you understand that I\'m not at risk of being disowned or hated because of who I am. I\'m an atheist and it\'s not a secret, my parents know it, my friends and peers know it, my teachers know it, hell even the principle knows it. None of them really care. They truly couldn\'t give a damn, it\'s just ""whatever"" to them. And this is just how accepting everyone is. My parents are liberal, and as such I knew that they wouldn\'t be upset. I had thought that my new religious school and classmates would be, but they didn\'t care, like I said. The teachers, while some of them disagree with it and have their own beliefs as to my judgment, I\'m sure, are not persecuting to me about it and don\'t try to make me repent or feel bad. My friends, don\'t believe that I will be punished or anything like that. While they are religious, they aren\'t archaic about it, and most don\'t even believe in hell. Now, I\'m also openly ""not straight"". I\'m pansexual. I like everyone. But as far as my friends are concerned I\'m just not straight or am just bi. I\'ve asked out 2 girls before (failed both times), and don\'t try and hide my interest for any of the sexy guys the girls swoon over. I\'ve only ever said that I didn\'t just like girls. I haven\'t really told them the label for it, but it doesn\'t matter. Everyone knows that I\'m pansexual, no one really cares, I don\'t care, it\'s all great. Except for one issue. Well, more like two actually. My parents. They don\'t know. I\'ve jsut never really felt up for telling them. I once hinted at it when saying that this would be the year of school in which I\'d actually consider dating and going out with someone. I kept it purposefully vague as to the gender. I didn\'t say I was going to ask girls out or have a boyfriend. They both asked me about that and both said that they loved me and wouldn\'t mind. I said the same thing to both of them, that with all do respect, it wasn\'t necessarily their business. And they accepted it and that was it. This was of course before I\'d come out about being pansexual to everyone, and still felt a bit timid about people knowing. Okay, I have to make a quick pause. I have a plan. I am coming out. And I\'m doing it in a way that I\'m proud of and think will work best for me. So I\'ve been writing/drawing these pages with pictures/words on them.

2017-02-24 15:20:01,5vy099,4,9,"Hiya. So I've been ""out"", for lack of a better word, since spring last year. Which is about October down here. I mean it starts in September but last year it was just all rain and snow so I didn't count it. ***OFF TRACK JEI!!!***

Ahum... So I haven't been hiding myself from public scrutiny is what I mean. It took me a few months to come to terms with the idea that *yes* there is such a thing as neither man nor woman outside of Intersex folks, and *yes* I've actually been that my whole life without knowing. Once I was through that I felt no fear for the ideals of people in my immediate surroundings who didn't like my being loud about it. Fuck 'em! They ruined the first half a decade of my teen years by beating the idea that not being straight was wrong into me. I wasn't gonna let that happen a second time. So when I started my job in December I showed up for my first shift with lipstick, nail polish (half of them done very nicely if I do say so myself) and a bra and skirt. I nixed the skirt idea early. It is way too sticky behind a bar and I only have the one nice-ish one at the moment. Having to clean beer off your knees at 4 in the morning ain't a happy fun time.
From there I have just embraced the idea that I can go out looking however I choose. I mean I did before, but I never really thought about dolling up before, or how fun it could be.

But that's not what I'm here to say. It's just context.
On Thursday night I went up on stage, in all my fey glory and for the first time in my life felt uncomfortable in my comfy clothes. I'd even gone for my looser knickers and rocker pants because I needed the pockets. But my bra felt constricting, my singlet clammy and my headband soaked.
I've realised part of this was simply nerves, but the other part was that I hated the idea of my looking like that being seen as a gimmick of some sort. It was a comedy show after all. I had to make these people laugh at the jokes and not just me. I can take ridicule and abuse with a smile, but up there, until I opened my mouth I wasn't a person. Just a concept. A long, thin queer with no context for the crowd to understand. I hated that feeling. I'm so glad I couldn't see their faces while I was on stage itself, because I'd seen enough of it on the floor to realise I was being seen as an act not a person...

It got better! I unexpectedly killed it on stage, even got an offer to do another gig sometime in the future. And of course once I started talking my nerves about the material just grabbed my trans angst and flung it to the horizon. I finished with a curtsy (I've always wanted to curtsy a crowd of people) and once I was down again I looked at all my fellow comedian hopefuls and noticed they no longer cared if it was drag I put on to look slightly funny or if *mayhaps* I was just a person who wanted to tell some jokes without dressing down or up. I was one of them; nervous, awkward, half drunk and fanging for a cigarette.

Just felt like sharing. Because I think there's a little bit of a lesson, for me at least. You shouldn't worry about how people see you. Some will laugh at you, others with you. But if you can laugh at yourself and be comfortable in the skin you have (and I don't mean physical traits there, more philosophical skin) then people will accept your being whether they like it or not.

What surgeries would I want to get if I was a girl? What hairstyle would I want to have if I was a girl? What kinds/styles of makeup would I want to use if I was a girl? Et cetera.

However, in additional to all of these feelings, I also feel very comfortable being a guy; indeed, while I dislike some--indeed, perhaps many--aspects of my body and face (basically, I'd like to andrognize my body and face) as well as male social roles (for instance, I would face the risk of getting beaten up if I will wear a dress or a skirt), I also enjoy living as a guy and all of that--as well as enjoy using male pronouns.

2017-02-27 04:59:07,5weu9j,8,28,"I was at a local LGBTQ+ group tonight and we did an exercise where we gave people compliments that were not based on appearance or anything outwardly visible, and it got me thinking about gender.

And I was thinking about my experience with gender, and how so much of my experience of gender is internal, abstract, and lies in the realm of ideas.

This was especially true when I was younger; when I was a kid and a teenager I lived mostly in the world of ideas and had little focus on my body.  As an adult I now focus on my body a bit more, but I find it's still not where the bulk of my experience of gender lies.

When I think about my experience of gender here are some of the things that come to mind:

* feeling discomfort whenever people are separated into gender and i'm forced into one group (usually boys), like I didn't belong in the group, didn't want to be there, and didn't like the idea of separating people to begin with.
* empathizing really strongly with people who are subjected to sexism and/or constrained because of their gender or when people make false assumptions about them on the basis of their gender (whether it was girls or boys). feeling a sort of fierce loyalty to people in this situation, and great distrust or discomfort when groups of males or groups of females band together ""against"" someone of the opposite gender, often wanting to protect the person being attacked.
* reading articles about ""how women think"" or ""how women cope with stress"" and thinking ""this sounds like it is describing me"" and then reading ""how men do such-and-such thing"" or ""what men want"" and thinking: ""I don't relate to this at all"", yet not feeling like i was a woman.  specific examples for me include holistic thinking, thinking more about social relationships, a desire for cooperation, a communication style full of sharing and affirmation and devoid of ""one-upsmanship"", or being more desiring of intimacy than sex in relationships.
* always wanting to transcend gender, like wanting to synthesize what I saw as the best of femininity and masculinity and distance myself from what I saw as negatives of each.  especially wanting to experience and understand things outside my experience to whatever degree possible, like how the female body worked (for example i've spent more hours listening to women talk about their periods, out of fascination, than any guy I've ever met, it's like something I love hearing about because it makes me feel more connected to the experience of women)
* often having an affinity for people whose personalities seem somehow gender deviant or gender-free, like girls who were tomboys, or who liked science, math, computers, or playing with bugs and dirt, or whose communication style was assertive and direct, and connecting more with boys who were more interested in social relationships, and who had more warm, mellow, and sweet personalities and were less aggressive or rambunctious, were good listeners.
* feeling discomfort with hyper-masculine or hyper-feminine presentation or personalities and gravitating away from those people.
* feeling discomfort with the assumptions that people bring, associated with them gendering me male (or rarely, female)
* seeing how people treat women and men differently socially, and sometimes wanting to be treated in ""the other"" way

Interestingly, a lot of the people that I feel like I've connected to on the deepest levels, with respect to aspects of gender, don't always have outwardly ""nonbinary"" presentation.  These can include nonbinary people who present in stereotypically masculine or feminine ways (which may match or be opposite to their assigned birth sex), and also cis people who look ""typical"" for their gender, but cross a lot of gender roles in personality or behaviors or ways of thinking.  I find these people help me to feel more comfy with myself and I like being around them.

I wanted to share these things because I wanted to help people to think about the deeper aspects of gender that aren't always immediately visible.

I sometimes feel very frustrated with how so much of the discussion of nonbinary people and trans people focuses on appearance and the body, whereas for me it's like really about personality and ways of thinking and social interactions and things like that.  It's super abstract and intangible but like really important to me.  I also sometimes get frustrated with the emphasis on identity.  For me, the people who really *get* my gender the most, have been cis people, probably mainly because they're my closest friends and they just happen to be cis.  The whole ""cis/trans"" divide has really frustrated me much in the same way the whole female/male divide frustrated me too.  So it's like, nonbinary identity is great for helping me make sense of my experience, but when it becomes an ""us vs. them"" like against cis people or against binary trans people, I get profoundly uncomfortable and I'm like...but...the whole reason I feel nonbinary to begin with is that I hate rigid categories!

I don't know, is this making any sense?

2017-02-28 16:14:01,5wovc9,7,13,"I've been slowly adjusting to the concept I may not be fully female, and well I'm happy for the most part, but I'm also having a lot of self doubts.  I'm DFAB and previously simply thought of myself as a feminine lesbian, but I had a fascination with the male body.  How it looked, how it felt etc what it would be like to have it sometimes.  I also has some desires to present in a more masculine way Ive started to acknowledge.  

&amp;nbsp;

The biggest self doubt however has come from how previously feminine I would look at times and go out of my way for it.  I would put on make up, show off my breasts, and try to make make curves look attractive.  I also had a slight fixation on certain parts of my body.  There's been a sort of voice I guess criticizing me mentally for those times where I enjoyed ""being pretty"". 

&amp;nbsp;

I think I've sort of come to the realization though that while I did enjoy those times, it wasn't as much as I thought.  I'm remembering more how I actually felt vs what that self doubting side tells me I did.  I enjoyed feeling like I was attractive and that people would look at me like I was.  To me at the time ring attractive meant being pretty and sexy and over all feminine.  My confidence came completely from how I thought other people looked at me.  Meanwhile my own thoughts on myself were either negative criticizing how things fit me or detached.  I'd think ""she's pretty"" but I wouldn't feel like I was saying it about myself.  It felt more like I was looking at a woman I found attractive than myself.  I genuinely enjoyed my more neutral clothing style where I put on a sweatshirt and some jeans and didn't feel like I had to be pretty or put on a show for anyone.  Those were the moments where I felt comfortable and self satisfied.

I've come to the conclusion I think need to relearn what confidence is to me, and what makes me feel good about myself versus what I think will attract other people to me.  Which is strange.  Realizing you've based your entire image and self worth on other people is sort of disheartening, but also freeing?  Like I've realized the problem and now I can start fixing it.  It's also helped with my self doubt some in that ""remember when you liked being pretty"" becomes ""I remember wanting other people to think I was pretty and give me attention and not being satisfied with how I looked no matter how hard I tried""

I\'m DFAB and previously simply thought of myself as a feminine lesbian, but I had a fascination with the male body.  How it looked, how it felt etc what it would be like to have it sometimes.  I also has some desires to present in a more masculine way Ive started to acknowledge.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe biggest self doubt however has come from how previously feminine I would look at times and go out of my way for it.  I would put on make up, show off my breasts, and try to make make curves look attractive.  I also had a slight fixation on certain parts of my body.  There\'s been a sort of voice I guess criticizing me mentally for those times where I enjoyed ""being pretty"". \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI think I\'ve sort of come to the realization though that while I did enjoy those times, it wasn\'t as much as I thought.  I\'m remembering more how I actually felt vs what that self doubting side tells me I did.  I enjoyed feeling like I was attractive and that people would look at me like I was.  To me at the time ring attractive meant being pretty and sexy and over all feminine.  My confidence came completely from how I thought other people looked at me.  Meanwhile my own thoughts on myself were either negative criticizing how things fit me or detached.  I\'d think ""she\'s pretty"" but I wouldn\'t feel like I was saying it about myself.  It felt more like I was looking at a woman I found attractive than myself.  I genuinely enjoyed my more neutral clothing style where I put on a sweatshirt and some jeans and didn\'t feel like I had to be pretty or put on a show for anyone.

I'm 22 and afab. As a kid I was your stereotypical girl: I loved Barbies, princesses, and the color pink. Even now as an adult I appear to be pretty feminine. But there's always been a little bit of me that sometimes also feels like a guy. I grew up on a farm and would regularly help my dad with farm stuff. I remember that sometimes when I'd be out with my dad and surrounded by other farmers (almost all who were guys) a part of me felt as if I should be a guy too. I shook off the feeling and never gave it much thought. When was 13 I started to realize that I also liked girls in addition to boys. I didn't know about bisexuality at the time so I was super confused. Even when I did realize I could be described the term bisexual, I was super uncomfortable with my sexuality for a long time. In early high school I felt awkward and ugly and I remember wishing at that time I was a boy. (I didn't know about trans or non binary genders at the time, but I know that if I did know about them I would have probably embraced those terms). This was the time in my life when I felt most dissatisfied with my gender. 
However, by the time my senior year came around I had shook off the feeling by telling myself that I only had felt that way because I was uncomfortable with my sexuality, didn't like female gender expectations, and didn't know how to feel feminine (it was at this time that I started experimenting with my fashion and make-up, embracing a very feminine look, and I felt very happy with it. Although now I feel that my ""super feminine"" look might have been me over compensating). So time passed and whenever I started to think about my gender I immediately assured myself that I was female and didn't allow myself to give it a second thought.
About 6 months ago after reading a book with a nonbinary character, I realized that I've been shrugging off the topic of my gender for to long. I've constantly been questioning my gender since but I haven't gotten any closer to figuring it out. I usually feel like I'm female, but I sometimes feel like I might also be a guy. I've experimented a bit with wearing men's underwear and sometimes I'll tell myself, ""I am also a man"" while looking in the mirror. Sometimes when I do this it feels so right but other times I just feel nothing. A part of me feels that I'm faking these feelings and doing this just because I want to be a special snowflake. But also I feel that a part of me is denying my true gender because the thought of how people would react and treat me if I was something other than a girl absolutely terrifies me.
