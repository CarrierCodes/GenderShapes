2017-07-01 21:34:17,6kpm5m,19,9,"Hi all,

I posted here last year sometime about my feelings on my gender (or lack thereof), and have continued to explore my own gender identity since. I have also  met my wonderful girlfriend who I feel very comfortable discussing my feelings with which has really helped.

I am AFAB, and currently identify as gay, but I always express myself in a very masculine way, I dress almost exclusively in men's clothes and have short hair as it's how I feel most comfortable. I have large breasts but always wear sports bras as I am uncomfortable with them but can't afford a good binder yet. I want to present as masculine as possible, but I don't feel trans, or at least I don't think I do. What all this boils down to is that I don't feel like a woman, and I am certain at this point that I do not fall into a binary gender category. 

I want to find the right description for me, just something that feels comfortable and natural, as I really would like to start coming out (again!) to friends and family. Currently I'm thinking of something like non-binary, genderqueer, or agender. So to help me in this process, would you guys mind telling me what description(s) you personally use, and why you identify with them?

I know I don't have to label myself, but in this case I want to, or at least want to try a couple out. I want to feel like I belong to a community a bit more, because at the moment I still feel lost.

I had said f it.  With my girls behind me. I said f it and went to Sephora to purchase foundation in person.  I said f the shame.  F the past 36 years.  I knew that I would need a color match.  I knew that I was walking in at the semi middle busiest time of the store.  I knew that it was the mall so there would be teens mulling about.  I said f it.  I had my pears.

In the middle of the store in front of a makeup battlestation I stood waiting for a sublime creature, Bailey, to use her magic and pick out a shade to match my skin.  My nerves had disappeared as I wanted this.  Telling her I currently used Loreal Perfect Match N3 she could understand what extra coverage I wanted.  Yielding her skin scanner, she scanned my cheek, neck and forehead, determined my skin tone and nonchalantly flicked through a tablet for matching products - MUFE just like Amy's.  She applied one swatch on my left cheek, an alternate shade on my right.  She disappeared into the aisle to grab another shade, cleaned my face, applied to left cheek again, and forehead and neck, asked co-worker to confirm...  She apologized a couple of times at how long it was taking as she wanted a good match -- I did too.  

In between, patiently waiting I chatted with my girls via the ether, the shoulders I leaned on -- as giddy as I was and wanting to know what was happening.  The other customers went about their business.  Bailey had me take a mirror AND WALK AROUND THE STORE to see how the shade looked in different lights.  I did that too because damn it the color did look a little different as I walked.  We had a match.   Bailey asked if I wanted to wear it out and what naturally came out of my mouth (because I wanted to look my best) was that I didn't have any color correcting concealer so I didn't want to.  

There in my hands was a black box, MUFE Matte #53.  Staring at it, it had become a symbol of a face to face exchange between someone (even if I was only in drab) who has been hidden for years with another -- not just talk, an exchange without shame and fear, I backed by wonderful gals hundreds of miles away only connected by ether -- they joking that I now could parade my Sephora bag around the mall -- and I did without shame.  All that and the only negative was, I forgot where I parked.

As I drove home, the wall must have continued falling because neutrality fell around me.  Neither dysphoria nor euphoria was present just a sereneness.  I was in drab and that was ok.

I am slowly but surely coming to terms with having to come out to my parents.

So I am 27, completely not depend on my parents anymore, my older brother is gay and out and my parents are in general very liberal. And I am still scared as fuck.

My mom already suspects, she had a talk with one of my friends while I wasn't there, where he apparently slipped up and my mom said something along the lines of 'I know who you mean', so I think she might just be waiting for me to come out anyway, even though she probably has no idea as what since genderqueer is probably not something she is familiar with? But the other reason why I am worried is b/c we never talk about serious stuff and feelings in my family and that makes coming out really awkward.

However, there is still this ridiculous part of me that talks myself out of coming out to certain friends because for the most part, on the outside, I look the same. I do not intend to take testosterone or have top surgery.

2017-07-04 19:21:35,6l94r2,16,11,"I'm just... not exactly sure what I am, once again. There are multiple things that are stressing me out...

Even if I deliberately think about my gender identity, I find myself unable to pin it down more or less precisely. If ""male"" were 0 and ""female"" were 10, I'd be somewhere between 6 and 9. But I don't want to call myself genderfluid. I don't identify with the label. I also feel like I don't qualify for nonbinary for whatever reason? IDK how to explain it. ;_;

My deadname, which is decidedly male, gives me a lot of dysphoria. Sometimes I'm able to cope with it, especially if I actually have other things to focus on, but other times it overwhelms me completely.

I really wish my appearance and voice were more feminine... [the voice I have now](http://clyp.it/wfdqkom4) is, in my opinion, pretty crappy. (And that's my best attempt at not sounding like a dude).

I'm AFAB and have been questioning my gender for years. Earlier this year I realized I thought I was FtM (before, I was just out as a lesbian). However, recently I let myself begin to explore new ideas: Maybe I'm not any gender in particular at all.

Yesterday, something just clicked into place. I know I don't feel female, but I don't necessarily feel male. I just sort of... don't seem to fit anywhere. But then, non binary/genderqueer seems to fit!

What I'm now wondering is: How can I know for sure? I'm pretty sure I am non binary, but sometimes I don't feel too dysphoric. (Other times I do.) Is it okay to wear feminine clothing sometimes as AFAB and still consider myself non binary/genderqueer? I know that sounds like a dumb question but part of me can't shake this doubt that I'm not ""trans enough"" to call myself non binary, and that I'm really just a confused lesbian. I mean, I don't really want to be female or male.

Is it ok to be genderqueer even if you don't feel dysphoria 100% of the time? (Mine comes and goes, so I'm never sure how to feel.)

https://www.instagram.com/p/BWQipdwhlcH/

First outfit is from the men's section, the Soffee's running shorts are made of nylon and feel so luxurious, I wish all my clothes were made of nylon! I have switched to mostly nylon undies now mostly men's but expanding to women's too. Wish it had pockets though. Not sure how I feel about the split sides. 

Second outfit is from women's section, I don't know why but so far all the short shorts I have encountered only have key pockets, except for underarmor. The pockets aren't that big but enough to hold my phone. I love the design, it is always nice to have something different from the usual solid color design. I will probably get some more women's underarmor shorts.

I cut an old pair of khakis and jeans, just need to hem the edges to make them mid thigh length. Should be more appropriate for going outside. Might need to get new khaki shorts though because my old ones are so baggy. I prefer tighter clothes now. I wore the jean shorts outside with my mom into a crowded area. I felt rather selfconcious, like out of dozens of people there only like 3 guys were wearing above the knee shorts and only 1 of them had long hair.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BWOr1johdff/

I have only been around the yard in my short shorts and I did notice some people passing by staring at me but I also have long hair and a shaggy beard so who knows which part is giving them pause, maybe all of them lol. but the only people who has said anything to me is my family. my mom kept saying stuff like ""wow your shorts are so short."" ""i didn't know they made men's shorts so short."" my cousin asked me why I am wearing girl shorts. and I ignored him. Then my mom attitude changed.

So I came out to my wife officially as non binary. I'm not changing my name, but asking to be called by a nickname that feels less gendered to me, and now using they/them pronouns.

Soon I'll send a note to my friends and then I guess eventually I'll come out to my parents?

Though I'm having some feelings about that. Because technically nothing is really different about me. So is it worth putting the stress on my mother? It seems like she's finally over my short hair and androgynous style (I'm AFAB and came out as gay 7 years ago). I'm worried if I come out as NB, I'll stress her out over something that, to me, feels like no big deal. 

I'm not doing HRT yet, and don't know that I ever will. Not getting top surgery yet, but may in the future if I can't get my chest size down by losing weight. So yeah like I said, nothing is really changing about me right now.

Has anyone else felt like this? Like they're not ""trans enough"" to need to come out as trans to parents or friends?

Anyways, I went to a friend's house where we did facemasks and makeup with another friend. Sidenote they both talked about some personal stuff and other things you wouldn't tell everyone, so it was nice to know they trusted that much. Honestly I really felt like I was treated like a girlfriend, even though I just sat there and soaked it in, not really able to add anything. Although I wish I looked better than I did, I think I looked my best so far.

So we got lunch, and headed to Ulta, a makeup store. I got gendered correctly the entire time by the employees which was super awesome. My friend even used the right name too without me correcting her except for one instance which is totally fine. It's hard to put into words how affirming it is. I only had one situation that became an issue but it doesn't have anything to do with gender.

I definitely have gained more confidence from this and the first time going out presenting how I want to. I never thought I'd ever have to come out (even if it's only a couple people) yet alone go out in public. I might have even come to the point where I come out to more people but still not sure on that, but that's a whole different story.

I'm polyamorous, and my two main relationships started before I have identified as non-cisgendered. As a result, I can never tell if they see me as anything but a man. If they just love me for me, or really get my gender. I still get misgendered a lot by one of them, but it doesn't really hurt, because she does it semi-ironically, or something. Also, she doesn't do it when it really matters, when I feel vulnerable.

Anyway, I started seeing someone new, and she talks to me in mixed language (much more important in Hebrew, where it's really hard to speak in neutral language). I really appreciated it, and she was basically the first one to show an interest in me, post genderqueer identity, with the way I present and all. Because of this, it was really painful when she misgendered me last night, but not only that, she got angry that I focused on myself.

Basically, she said something about herself, and she felt she was exposing herself and her thoughts, but one of those thoughts was along the lines of ""He's just another guy..."". So I told her it bummed me, and the conversation went around that for a bit until she told me she was angry and the conversation was over.

This morning I wake up to a message saying that she was angry because I took the conversation back to me when she tried to say some things about her. Then she threw my own words in my face, me saying that I'm aware of the fact I take up space as a man would, and is the reason I identified as male non-conforming for a while. So she said Man, or not, you didn't give me space.

I feel like she doesn't quite get how hurtful that misgendering is, especially that last bit. But I don't know, maybe I'm overreacting. Maybe I'm being defensive instead of admitting I was wrong.

I'm a late 20s female, reasonably successful (in terms of career, independence, etc), always struggled with gender identity privately, not talked about it.

In fact, it would make my life more difficult and because I don't feel dysphoric, it wouldn't be worth it for me. 

I guess I'm a shoddy female. I don't wear make-up and fuck dresses. I moisturize/wash my face but that's it.

When I think of myself, it's just this kind of neutral entity. Sometimes I have dreams about me having a penis or no parts at all.

I don't give a shit about any of this ""womanhood"" or ""sisterhood"" shit...why do we have to stick together, again? I'm all for equal rights for everyone but I'm not going to give you a blind pat on the back just because we both have lady bits. 

I don't know, does anyone feel the same way? I'm a ""she"" but it feels kind of meaningless. It's just something I do because this is what I was born into and I don't really feel/understand my gender identity. I'm just me. Define me for me, by my traits and actions, not just because I'm female.

I'm 23, AFAB and genderqueer/trans-masculine. I'm dating a 24 year old trans girl, and I love her more than anything.

She had a doctors appointment today with a new doctor, one who's willing to start HRT probably very soon. I'm happy for her!

But in all the talk about hormones lately, and transitioning. I've started thinking about my own identity more and how much I honestly hate myself. I've been comfortable identifying as genderqueer/nonbinary for close to 5 years now. I've thought about transitioning, but my dysphoria is about such specific things, I don't think I'll ever be happy either way.

I know for sure most of my physical dysphoria comes from my breasts, I have a binder but would love to get top surgery someday. That's honestly the only thing I'm sure about. I'd like to start hormones, I want a deeper voice and to present more androgynously, or at least be seen as male rather than female. But I'm really bothered by the elongated clit especially. My vagina doesn't give me any dysphoria, I like it and don't want it to change, and I feel if I started T, my clit would grow and I'd just hate it, and as far as I know, that's one of the irreversible effects of testosterone.

But I also know I'm not happy being constantly labelled as female. I hate my voice and even though I don't mind my body, I'd be able to live with a slightly different shape and facial hair, I'd probably just end up shaving it. Mainly my dysphoria is that no matter what I do, hormones or not, I'll never be seen as nonbinary, because society doesen't work that way right now. 

Anyway, I feel like either way, I'll hate myself and my body, I'll never be able to match how I see myself in my mind. I'm painfully jealous my girlfriend can get that for herself and I feel like at this point I should just suck it up and make a choice: stay how I am, or go full-on male.

2017-07-14 15:17:10,6n9o01,5,6,"Hey. Thanks for taking the time to read this. It's probably lame and/or pointless but here's the deal...

I'm 24 years old, AMAB. Even as a kid, I often thought about being a girl. It really appealed to me. I never tried makeup or dressing in feminine clothes, but it's something I never stopped thinking about, even to now. For a while, I thought I might be trans. And I definitely do wish I had been born female. But no, there are definitely times I'm comfortable being a man, and with feeling masculine.

Even so, I'm not at all happy with my body. At times like the one I'm going through now, the dysphoria is unbearable. I catch sight of myself in the mirror, and I recoil in almost tangibly painful disgust. 

I want to be more feminine in general. And I'm not exactly a sterling example of a manly man. I'm a small, soft-spoken nerdy dude. But I was born with a barrel chest and corresponding broad shoulders, with a large, high forehead and terrible, thin hair. I went yesterday to get a haircut that was supposed to be androgynous, and feel like I walked away only looking more masculine. I shave close, often to the point of nicking myself several times, yet the shadow of stubble never seems to go away, even if it feels smooth to the touch.

So... I don't know. What can I do? I have no experience with trying to present as feminine, and so far anything I do just doesn't work. I don't know where to start. I don't even know if it's possible, with how shitty my body is. I'm considering HRT, not to fully transition, but to feminize my body at least. But even that can't fix everything.

I am also planning on coming out to my parents, but probably after I come out at college. I do not think my parents will freak or anything (my mom has showed a surprising amount of support for trans people) but they would probably be super confused so I want some practice.

-----------------------------------------

Hi Family &lt;3

So I'm doing this in an email because even though I'm [AGE], I'm a coward. Plus with things like this, it helps to get it all out at once.

Here goes. I'm coming out again! This time as nonbinary/genderqueer, which is an identity that falls under the transgender umbrella. Whoa buddy. What does that even mean? Here are some links:

[INSERT YOUR PREFERRED LINKS]

The basics are this: Though I was Assigned Female At Birth, I've recently come to terms with the fact that I've never quite felt female. That said, I also don't quite feel male either. Growing up, I didn't know what this meant. I didn't even know it was a thing. Today, in 2017, trans folks are so much more visible than they ever were, and I've learned about all of the possibilities that are out there. Imagine my surprise when suddenly it all clicked, like ""Whoa... that's me!""

I wish I could tell you I was 100% certain about where I stand and who I will eventually become (side note wouldn't it be cool to know this for ANYTHING in life? LOL.) I don't know if I will get any surgeries. I don't know if I will do hormone replacement therapy. Thankfully, I've been seeing a gender therapist for the past few months and will continue to do so, because I'm still learning a lot about myself and what I want! It's all very new but it feels very right.

The most important thing I've learned is that it's CRUCIAL for me to let you in on my journey. The feeling of keeping a secret from you is the worst. I love you so much, and I want you to know what's going on with me and I hope we can all learn together.

Things I know for sure:

- For now, I'd like to keep this between us. Shouldn't be too hard! Brother, I obviously am ok with you telling your family! You can even just show them this email if you want. Eventually, I will be coming out publicly. When I'm ready.

- I'd like to start using the gender-neutral pronouns ""they/them/theirs"". I know this feels grammatically incorrect, but I bet you already use these pronouns in day-to-day conversations, (i.e. someone left their backpack here!, etc). Turns out language is constantly changing and evolving! And Merriam-Webster recognizes gender neutral pronouns as valid! Can you imagine if language never evolved? We'd all be saying ""thee, thou, etc"". Anyway, the more you use the pronouns the more comfortable they'll feel. I know this from experience.

- I'd like to ween everyone off [BIRTH NAME]. It's a beautiful name, but I never felt like it belonged to me. Sorry Mom and Dad :( For now, I'd prefer nicknames like [INSERT NICKNAMES]. I’ll let you know when I decide on the perfect name.

- I am literally the exact same person I always was. I will continue to be a tomboy, have short hair, dress like a 16 year old boy in summer, dress like an old fisherman in winter, get tattoos that you hate, use the F word on the internet, incessantly post photos of my cats on Instagram, etc.

I've also made a preemptive Q&amp;A for some things you may be thinking!!!

But what about that period of time in college that you were SO girly!!

- If I remember correctly, that lasted from age 19-21. That's three years of my life. 1/10 of my time on earth. If you'll remember before that, I was scared to TEARS at the very IDEA of dressing girly. It always felt like a costume I was wearing for other people, never for myself. Plus, after the girly period, I reverted back to my old tomboy ways, dressing more androgynously as time went on, leading me to where I am now. So the ""girly period"" was fun, but I think that contributes to my non-binary-ness! I didn't mind being girly, but who I am now feels better. Which brings me to my next point.

Do you have Gender Dysphoria (the terrible feeling of being uncomfortable in your body)? You seem so happy!

- I recently heard someone say, ""Sometimes it's not about gender dysphoria, but gender euphoria."" Yes, I have always hated my hips and my large chest. But everything else, I'm fine with it. I feel okay in my female body. I'm okay with the fact that I have both feminine and masculine mannerisms. But when I am perceived as androgynous, feel REALLY happy. Think of it this way: Mom, would it make you feel good if someone thought you were a man? NOPE! Dad or [BROTHER], how would it feel if someone thought you were a woman? NO THANKS. But for me, when someone mistakes me for a ""Sir"", or is confused about my gender, I love it. It feels really GOOD. It makes me feel like myself. There you have it: Gender Euphoria!

I'm devastated at the thought of losing my little girl!!

- See above. I'm still me!! In fact, I'll be a better happier version of myself!! Plus, nothing can take away your memories of the little girl you knew! She was so cute, but she's been gone for a while if you think about it. I grew up and out of my pink pajamas over two decades ago, y'know.

Yeah but LEGALLY and BIOLOGICALLY you'll still be female!

Correct. It's possible to be both non-binary and female! Biologically, yes, my SEX is Female. But for me and many others, GENDER is a Spectrum (insert liberal hippy peace sign and read more at the links above). I am non-binary/genderqueer.

Whew. So.

That's all I have for now. I'll let this sink in today, and if I don't hear from you (I hope I do!!!), I'll be FaceTiming each of you tomorrow to check in. I love you so much, more than anything on earth, and I hope you'll continue to love and accept me the same as you always have. You've always been the best, I feel pretty confident that you will. Please prove me right. 
￼
Love,

Your child / sibling (lol, we'll work on that...)

Others, I added brackets where you could swap in your own info if you wanted.\n\nHope you enjoy.\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nHi Family &lt;3\n\nSo I\'m doing this in an email because even though I\'m [AGE], I\'m a coward. Plus with things like this, it helps to get it all out at once.\n\nHere goes. I\'m coming out again! This time as nonbinary/genderqueer, which is an identity that falls under the transgender umbrella. Whoa buddy. What does that even mean? Here are some links:\n\n[INSERT YOUR PREFERRED LINKS]\n\nThe basics are this: Though I was Assigned Female At Birth, I\'ve recently come to terms with the fact that I\'ve never quite felt female. That said, I also don\'t quite feel male either. Growing up, I didn\'t know what this meant. I didn\'t even know it was a thing. Today, in 2017, trans folks are so much more visible than they ever were, and I\'ve learned about all of the possibilities that are out there. Imagine my surprise when suddenly it all clicked, like ""Whoa... that\'s me!""\n\nI wish I could tell you I was 100% certain about where I stand and who I will eventually become (side note wouldn\'t it be cool to know this for ANYTHING in life? LOL.) I don\'t know if I will get any surgeries. I don\'t know if I will do hormone replacement therapy. Thankfully, I\'ve been seeing a gender therapist for the past few months and will continue to do so, because I\'m still learning a lot about myself and what I want! It\'s all very new but it feels very right.\n\nThe most important thing I\'ve learned is that it\'s CRUCIAL for me to let you in on my journey. The feeling of keeping a secret from you is the worst. I love you so much, and I want you to know what\'s going on with me and I hope we can all learn together.\n\nThings I know for sure:\n\n- For now, I\'d like to keep this between us. Shouldn\'t be too hard! Brother, I obviously am ok with you telling your family! You can even just show them this email if you want. Eventually, I will be coming out publicly. When I\'m ready.\n\n- I\'d like to start using the gender-neutral pronouns ""they/them/theirs"". I know this feels grammatically incorrect, but I bet you already use these pronouns in day-to-day conversations, (i.e. someone left their backpack here!, etc). Turns out language is constantly changing and evolving! And Merriam-Webster recognizes gender neutral pronouns as valid! Can you imagine if language never evolved? We\'d all be saying ""thee, thou, etc"". Anyway, the more you use the pronouns the more comfortable they\'ll feel. I know this from experience.\n\n- I\'d like to ween everyone off [BIRTH NAME]. It\'s a beautiful name, but I never felt like it belonged to me. Sorry Mom and Dad :( For now, I\'d prefer nicknames like [INSERT NICKNAMES]. I’ll let you know when I decide on the perfect name.\n\n- I am literally the exact same person I always was. I will continue to be a tomboy, have short hair, dress like a 16 year old boy in summer, dress like an old fisherman in winter, get tattoos that you hate, use the F word on the internet, incessantly post photos of my cats on Instagram, etc.\n\nI\'ve also made a preemptive Q&amp;A for some things you may be thinking!!!\n\nBut what about that period of time in college that you were SO girly!!\n\n- If I remember correctly, that lasted from age 19-21. That\'s three years of my life. 1/10 of my time on earth. If you\'ll remember before that, I was scared to TEARS at the very IDEA of dressing girly. It always felt like a costume I was wearing for other people, never for myself. Plus, after the girly period, I reverted back to my old tomboy ways, dressing more androgynously as time went on, leading me to where I am now. So the ""girly period"" was fun, but I think that contributes to my non-binary-ness! I didn\'t mind being girly, but who I am now feels better. Which brings me to my next point.\n\nDo you have Gender Dysphoria (the terrible feeling of being uncomfortable in your body)? You seem so happy!\n\n- I recently heard someone say, ""Sometimes it\'s not about gender dysphoria, but gender euphoria."" Yes, I have always hated my hips and my large chest. But everything else, I\'m fine with it. I feel okay in my female body. I\'m okay with the fact that I have both feminine and masculine mannerisms. But when I am perceived as androgynous, feel REALLY happy. Think of it this way: Mom, would it make you feel good if someone thought you were a man? NOPE! Dad or [BROTHER], how would it feel if someone thought you were a woman? NO THANKS. But for me, when someone mistakes me for a ""Sir"", or is confused about my gender, I love it. It feels really GOOD. It makes me feel like myself. There you have it: Gender Euphoria!\n\nI\'m devastated at the thought of losing my little girl!!\n\n- See above. I\'m still me!! In fact, I\'ll be a better happier version of myself!! Plus, nothing can take away your memories of the little girl you knew! She was so cute, but she\'s been gone for a while if you think about it. I grew up and out of my pink pajamas over two decades ago, y\'know.\n\nYeah but LEGALLY and BIOLOGICALLY you\'ll still be female!\n\nCorrect. It\'s possible to be both non-binary and female! Biologically, yes, my SEX is Female. But for me and many others, GENDER is a Spectrum (insert liberal hippy peace sign and read more at the links above). I am non-binary/genderqueer.\n\nWhew. So.\n\nThat\'s all I have for now. I\'ll let this sink in today, and if I don\'t hear from you (I hope I do!!!), I\'ll be FaceTiming each of you tomorrow to check in. I love you so much, more than anything on earth, and I hope you\'ll continue to love and accept me the same as you always have. You\'ve always been the best, I feel pretty confident that you will. Please prove me right. \n￼\nLove,\n\nYour child / sibling (lol, we\'ll work on that...)\n \n\n', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': ""I came out as NB/genderqueer to my family!!

2017-07-23 06:35:51,6ozysx,4,1,"I've been entertaining/obsessing over the idea that I might be agender or something along those lines.

Basically, I think gender is a crock.  I don't think the individual ""soul"" or whatever consciousness is has innate gender - Personally, I feel much more like a star or a flame or some kind of abstract musical light-thing than something in the shape of a man or a woman per se.

Growing up (AMAB) I was always skeptical of gender norms, the idea of being able to predict what a person's personality is like from their body.  Like the idea that boys should get a certain kind of happy meal toy and girls another.  What absurdity.  I was always comfortable experimenting at the edges, trying on dresses and stuff like that - before I learned it was a faux pas.  I firmly believe that an individual can ""be"" and ""do"" anything, and should manifest themselves in the most authentic and unique way they can.

Flash forward today and I find myself curiously surrounded by genderqueer folk.  It feels like majority of my friends, crushes, etc. have been queer as balls and that I mesh with them all really well, and I'm down with all the theory and the activism and all that.  Am I just some weird kind of fetishist or douchey ""ally,"" or is there a resonance there based on my own identity?  Or is my social scene completely irrelevant?

If other people are to be believed, I'm probably not GQ.

I was hanging out with a friend of mine who was describing our friend group to a newcomer.  She said ""our group is made entirely of queer people... and Thomas!"" - it was cute and I felt flattered to be special, but also oddly othered.

A much less cute instance was the time a former partner gave an impassioned speech about how I would never understand them (a transmasculine/agender person) because I was raised a cis male.

So, what's the deal?

Thing is, I certainly don't ""look queer"".  Aside from having a tiny frame, lovely long hair and gratuitous eyelashes, I look like your typical cismale - I have XY chromosomes, a big ol penis, copious body hair and I sport a fancy beard.  I get lots of compliments on my body and it (finally! after years of illness) works well and is healthy.

I don't experience body dysphoria.  On the contrary, I love my body.  My feelings about the body are that it's best to work with what I have and make the best of the constraints nature gave me.

(Which isn't to say I don't sometimes dream about waking up in the body of a woman - if I could wave a wand and painlessly, possibly reversibly, make it so, I would.  But that's not the way it works, so I choose to let go.)

I primarily find myself sexually and romantically attracted to women and nonbinary/trans folks.  So that may or may not mean I'm ""straight"".

I wear dapper-ass men's clothing because I love pockets; so I don't often break gendered ""dress codes"".

And I adore my name.  I have no qualms about the fact that it's a traditional ""boy"" name.  Since after all it is MINE.  (""I am Gandalf, and Gandalf means ME!"")

So there's not a lot of outside, empirical data to suggest that I'm genderqueer.
However, I still don't really identify with the socially constructed image of ""men"".  I'm very much not that.  Nor could I identify fully with ""women"".  So that seems to point me to an affirmative on the ""am I nonbinary"" front.

But at the same time I also have been very reluctant to explore or push the issue.  Because let's be completely honest, society gives genderqueer people a really fucking hard time.  If I can pass as cis and just quietly and inwardly roll my eyes at gender, I'm so much safer than claiming the identity and rocking the boat.

So the question becomes, do any of these things I mentioned bar me from claiming GQ identity?

And a step beyond - if I fit the bill, ought I claim the identity, or keep coasting by in my very useful protective bubble of passing privilege?  Since gender is a total mess, why bother claiming an identity at all, even to say I don't have an identity?

Or am I just a dabbling dilettantish intellectual hopping on a train to win approval?  It's a confusing spot to be in.

Any and all thoughts will be appreciated!
:)

&amp;nbsp;

In the past I wouldnhave this weird back and forth where one daybor week I'd think ""oh those are nice"" and even had phases where I went out of my way to show them off (mostly due to low self esteem and in my high school mind large breasts equaled easy compliments), but about half of the time I'd look and they'd seem so saggy and gross.  Like ""god why do my boobs look like misshapen lumps of fat?"" When they hadn't looked that way to me earlier.

I occasionally bind now and will sometimes wear more flattening clothibg when I get that feeling.  They just seem so heavy and ugly on those days and I don't feel like dealing with them.  Other days I have a weird apathy where I basically think ""oh those are okay"" and don't bother hiding them.

&amp;nbsp;

Whenever I feel alright with them there's this weird disconnect.  Like they look nice and I like them but they aren't mine.  The easiest way to describe it is it's like someone glued my head to someone elses torso which probably sounds like a strange way to put it but its the best I've got.

I kind of never thought I would make a post like this. I've been questioning my gender for about a couple months now. I am AMAB but I always thought I was just a cis-dude who was kind of feminine, but after having a chat with a friend where they asked me what my experience of femininity was (the first time anyone asked me a question like that) I felt a kind of ""wall"" break down. 

Since then I've kind of been trying to suss out what I am feeling and I've been struggling so much. On the one hand, I feel this intense pull towards the label trans but when I reflect on things for a bit, I don't feel like I want to change my body in any marked way (I like how hairy I am, I love my beard, I love my dick). I also don't feel the desire to present in a more feminine way - as in, I don't feel a draw to wear dresses, or makeup - I like my style quite a bit. I also don't want to surgically change myself (I don't want breasts, a vagina, etc.) 

I also have a tendency to try to fit myself into boxes because I have very severe anxiety which makes it hard for me to cope with ambiguity.

So I guess what I'm saying is, I don't want to feel more feminine but I also feel like I am more feminine? and that causes me to panic for some reason, because I don't know how to reconcile feeling a certain way already with now feeling the need to have a category for it?

2017-07-25 23:29:49,6pk4v0,2,5,"Hey, all. 

I'm not even certain this is real. I've always used female pronouns out of convenience because I was faab, but I've never really identified as female in a real sense. In fact, being female (bodied) has been something that I rarely feel good about, usually ignore, and often outright reject. A few years ago when I was really struggling with being female, I settled on identifying as agender and kind of thought, ""I don't care what anyone thinks, but I don't have to ascribe to any gender role. I can dress and act how I want."" I kept my pronouns, cut my hair off and incorporated a lot of androgyny into my wardrobe. I felt more confident and more comfortable with my presentation. I wrote off my dysphoria as a discomfort with the societal expectations of femininity, and never considered that it might be my body that I was uncomfortable with.

So basically I have never truly identified as any gender. I think a lot of it is that gender roles are very constrictive, and I think they are awful. I thought I didn't care what my body looked like as long as I didn't have to follow any gender roles, but yesterday I ran into some very different emotions. I was watching some transgender videos on youtube my friend had recommended to me and I came across an ftm transformation video. I clicked on it out of curiosity but as I was watching it I started crying. Afterwards, I looked in the mirror and for the first time imagined myself as a man. My heart was racing and I felt like I couldn't breathe. It's all I've been able to think about since. 

I'm definitely going to give this a lot of thought and I'm not asking for a diagnosis or anything, but I just needed someone to vent. My partner is out of the country for two weeks and they're probably the only person I'd feel comfortable reaching out to about this. Thanks for reading.

As a child, gender was presented to me in a very binary way, so my thoughts on gender were obviously very binary. I never really wanted to be a girl. One of my earliest memories is thinking something along the lines of ""when I grow up, I want to be a boy."" As I got older and learned that that was not an option for me, I instead wanted to be hyper-feminine, even though it didn't really feel right. I just saw those two options, and only one seemed attainable to me.

From the age I started school to about puberty, everything went smoothly. I was a tomboy, preferring male friends over female and Hot Wheels over Barbies. Puberty is when life started sucking for real. When I had my first period, I basically had a panic attack. I did not want this ""womanhood"" thrust upon me. I despised wearing training bras. I couldn't relate to a lot of my friends (both guys and girls seemed crazy to me when they displayed typical gendered behavior). I was also diagnosed with depression around this time.

2017-07-27 04:58:30,6ptrpd,5,8,"Hi. I'm sixteen years old and live on the West Coast of the United States. I have questioned my gender for basically my entire life. I was AFAB, and currently identify as a cisgender queer woman. (I identified as a lesbian for awhile there, but was recently thrown for a loop in terms of romantic &amp; sexual orientation as well.)

I can definitely remember wishing I was a boy as a really young kid. However, this feeling subsided significantly as soon as I recognized myself as queer. I now believe that I never truly wanted to be a boy; I was just envious that it was acceptable for a boy to fall in love with a girl, but not for me to. This theory was further substantiated as I began dating girls, and found a power in my femininity. It's been about three years since then, and all of the questions I have dealt with in the past have returned. Allow me to explain.

There are some days that I love calling myself a woman. I put on tight clothing, and embrace my curves. On these days, I am proud to be a woman that loves other women. I am okay with being seen.

Other days are difficult. I slip into my baggiest sweats and pull on a hoodie. On these days, I want to cut off my breasts and severely mutilate my genitals. I feel like my body has betrayed me, and I am furious.

Now, at face value, this sounds a lot like gender dysphoria. Except there is a huge factor that complicates things. I am a survivor of years of sexual abuse and assault by multiple people. The anger at my body could be about my gender; or it could be about the way that my body was used for all of those years without my permission.

I'm miserably confused, but terrified to talk to anyone about it. Telling the whole story would mean revealing my status as a survivor, and I'm really not at that place yet. I am in the process of switching to a new therapist, and this is not something I want to bring up to a brand new person just yet.

2017-07-27 09:11:45,6pureu,3,4,"Hi, everyone. After reading a few other people's threads here, I decided to make my own in hopes that I could get some clarity. I understand that labels are, in the end, entirely up to me...it's just that I thought I was cis female until very recently so I'm still new at everything (although I HAVE been trying to educate myself on everything I've been missing) so I guess I would like everyone's ""more expert"" opinion.

First of all, I am a bisexual AFAB. Sexuality was a whole another monster I had to tackle...and I only came to terms with it when I reached my 20s (I come from a very conservative family that still to this very day think LGBTQ people are just ""faking it"" and am still closeted to family, even though my friends know I'm not straight.)

I also suffer from mental illness (anxiety/depression), which has made it difficult for me to accept myself to begin with (and not just in matters of gender/sexuality). Body image issues, poor self esteem, I've had it all...although it has gotten a lot better recently, esp after accepting my sexual identity+gaining a better support system.

So, I don't have much gender dysphoria anymore (although I do sometimes experience it--bottom but not top--esp in intimate situations) but I HAVE wished I wasn't female. I remember being especially uncomfortable during puberty, though, and wanting to be a boy when I was a kid (but even this I'm unsure whether or not it matters since I'm the only  girl in my entire family...so maybe I was just feeling ""left out"" among my many boy cousins?) I identified more with male TV/book characters--but since I'm also bi, I had this strange experience of also being attracted to them. In my dreams, I'm almost always a guy--or at least in the dreams where I'm happy with myself. However, despite all this, since I didn't have that strong body dysmorphia that my clearly FTM or even some nonbinary friends had, I didn't think I was trans.

To make things trickier, although in past years, I was more uncomfortable with it, I've recently grown to embrace my female body (although I suspect this may have to do with the fact that I've grown more accepting towards myself in general.) I love dressing up in feminine clothing and although I wore more gender neutral clothing as a teen, now, I find myself gravitating toward more feminine clothing...mostly because I know I look good in it. (Which I know doesn't matter to a certain extent since there are gay men who love dressing up in drag.) I actually like my not-flat chest, and I know I probably won't transition...at least not until they develop a better male bottom part since most of my dysphoria lies down there anyway. I'm also ok with she/her pronouns and my feminine name. 

So, I don't know. What are your thoughts? I've checked threads by people for each of the labels I've listed above but keep thinking I'm not ""FTM enough,"" ""nonbinary enough,"" ""gender fluid enough,"" or even ""cis enough"" so I'd really appreciate any insight you may have on this matter.

A few thoughts I have on what I preferred about being gender-nonconforming in a community where that wasn't even a thing:

""Coming out"" was not a thing that had to happen, because I didn't know there was anything to come out as, and neither did my community. I didn't know any trans-related terminology, I just knew I ""didn't feel like a boy or girl,"" so I acted accordingly by dressing androgynously and not doing gender-related behaviors or tasks if I didn't feel like it. For their part, people around me knew I was ""androgynous"" (I don't think they distinguish between expression and actual gender) and have learned that they can't expect me to do ""girl"" things, and that's about as far as their understanding of my gender is ever going to go - and I'm actually fine with that. I never knew or cared about other forms of acknowledgement and respect (pronouns, name changes, alternative words for anatomy...and this isn't to say that these aren't critically important for some and shouldn't be respected) before going to college and also reading up on gender nonconformity, the discussion around which seems to be driven by educated, socially-aware liberal people who put more emphasis on the language of dealing with trans people (way more than a lot of people in my community would be able to get their heads around) than just interacting with them naturally.

Mods- If this isn't the correct place for this post, could you spin me in the right direction?


I wonder if I can beg for your input. Most of the ""questioning"" subreddits seem dead and the ""gender"" subreddits seem kind of trollish (but I could be interpreting them wrong?)


Anyway, I'm AFAB and have been on T for one year. I had top surgery last month. Up until then, I was sure that I was a transman.


Well, two things have thrown a wrench in my gender identity. The first: I am so so happy with my body now. I love my surgery scar, I've never wanted breasts. I love how I look and am feeling very confident.


Number 2: Apart from a couple hairs on my chin and downstairs growth, I haven't seen many changes on T. So, I asked my doctor about this 2 weeks ago. He casually suggested I double my dose. Well, I've been feeling more feminine recently (trying on makeup and clothes) and don't know if I can attribute it to this. Yesterday I had excruciating cramps and today, Aunt Flo came back.


I'm in such a weird headspace right now. I know it scares my friends to say the word detransition, so am turning to you, Reddit. I hope that you can help me. I'm just not sure anymore. I've thought of going back to being a girl, being andro, genderqueer. Has anyone gone through similar?

Dr. Dhejne has [**emphatically denounced**](http://transadvocate.com/fact-check-study-shows-transition-makes-trans-people-suicidal_n_15483.htm) these kinds of misrepresentation of her work. Her study found only that trans people who transition *prior to 1989* had slightly higher rates of suicide attempts than the general public (but still far lower than pre-transition levels), and that trans people post-transition have slightly higher rates of needing mental health services. The study specifically identified abuse and discrimination as the cause of these differences.

Since the interview in which she spelled out why these misrepresentations of her work are wrong is from The TransAdvocate, I've seen people claim the source isn't valid and the interview is fraudulent. I look forward to linking to a reddit AMA thread to show why this bullshit is wrong in the future.

She is also the primary author of [**another study**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262734734_An_Analysis_of_All_Applications_for_Sex_Reassignment_Surgery_in_Sweden_1960-2010_Prevalence_Incidence_and_Regrets) from 2014, which looked at ""regret"" rates among trans patients over a 50 year period, and (predictably) found that they were in the low single-digits and falling.

2017-07-28 06:18:10,6q1zgi,2,4,"Heyyyy, not sure if this or /r/mtf or /r/asktransgender would be more appropriate but it'd probably be a good idea to post here anyways.

So for some context, I am a 20-yo amab who's had a queer identity of some sort since middle school. In elementary school I never really felt any sexual attraction, but in middle school and high school I realized I was bi and hyper-sexual. I've since been dating a wonderful man for the past 3 years, and I've always liked crossdressing in the bedroom. However, lately I've been feeling more uncomfortable with my body and the baggage that comes with identifying as a man.

I've got too much body hair and jagged nails from habitual nailbiting, and I'm just repulsed every time I look at myself without spending an utterly impractical amount of time in the shower shaving my whole body. I think that, along with really not liking being called 'handsome' or associated with the word 'man', might be some kind of dysphoric feeling.

On the flipside though, I feel absolutely no genital dysphoria. I don't like how I was circumcised but beyond that I have no problems with my penis. I also feel more neutral and somewhat apprehensive about identifying as a woman too, I'm past puberty so it'd be a concerted effort for what'd likely be an awkward transition.

So, my main questions to ask;

1. If I was going to transition, what would be my possible end-game scenarios? I want to look cuter and more girly, but can I be a woman without an inevitable orchiectomy?
2. If I was to go about presenting as non-binary, what options do I have there? I know I'd have to be more vigilant about maintaining my appearance, but I live in California and we'll be getting X gender markers soon.
3. I know this is something I'd eventually have to answer myself, but am I in this for the right reasons? I feel just as apprehensive and off-put about being a cis man invading trans spaces as I am about carrying the baggage masculine identity has.
