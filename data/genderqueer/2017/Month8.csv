2017-08-02 11:47:29,6r3m5k,24,22,"Hi all,
Sorry this is super long. Just reaching out to see if anyone has had a similar experience as me, as I feel I am going crazy atm. I am 29 years old, AMAB and started MtF HRT in 2015.

I guess when I first started exploring my gender identity around 25-26, I realised I had a lot of dysphoria around being male both socially and physically. At first I didn't even consider that I might be female, just not male in a traditional sense. I made changes to become more of a feminine/androgynous guy, sort of inspired by Bishounen anime character or the gender ambiguous Kpop/Jpop dudes in asian cultures. I wanted to look like a girl, almost to the stage of passing as one, be pretty and cute instead of handsome and masculine and be afforded alot of the social flexibilities that girls have over guys (around clothing etc.)

After making alot of non HRT changes (growing hair out, lasering facial hair, wearing makeup, dressing androgynously), people started to gender me as female on occasions. People referred to me as ""she"" or ""ladies"" when I was out with friends, held doors open for me etc. and tbh it made me feel really warm and fuzzy inside. I had started dating guys for the first time (I'm bi) and had my first boyfriend and when I was with him, I kind of felt like his girlfriend. He kind of picked up on it I think and he treated me like I was the female in the relationship (in a traditional gender role sense), he was really protective of me and it felt really nice :)

To the rest of the people in my life, my sort of gender ambiguity was seen as something really unique. No one thought I was trans, but I would get comments from people at work how I was ""bizarrely pretty for a guy"". I would wear makeup (mostly eyeliner) and cute unisex girls clothes, my old friends picked up on the makeup and told me ""it really suits you, for some reason"".

With all the feelings I had around being gendered female and looking at transition timelines of trans women and the effects of HRT, I became drawn to the idea of transitioning to female. I wasn't really 100% certain, but alot of signs were pointing to a good possibility that I was MtF and I really wanted to take hormones to further feminize myself. I went through the usual counselling and medical process to get HRT. My counsellor and I were fairly convinced I was female and would be happier making the transition. I started HRT and came out to my friends/family/work, which went surprisingly well, the majority of people were supportive and willing to work with me around pronouns, new name, bathrooms etc.

So I was on HRT and lived as a female full time for about a year. Overall I enjoyed the physical changes and being gendered female. The feelings of being on hormones made me feel alot more calmer and a bit warm and fuzzy. Howeve, my external life had become alot more awkward. I became a lot less confident in myself and became more negative about my body image, I put so much focus and energy and fear on passing. I went from being a fairly outgoing person to a bit of recluse, I wouldn't go out as much in public for fear of people staring at me and for someone who was previously extroverted and chatty, I stopped talking to people because I felt my voice was too deep. I also didn't know who I was anymore, I was trying so hard to bury my old male self but at the same time felt like I lost my familiar base, I didn't know how to be a woman. Life would fluctuate between feeling happy about obtaining my girl self, but for the most part just stressful and scary.

Overtime the initial coming out excitement wore off, I burn't out, spiraled into a pretty bad depression and ended up in hospital. What helped me recover was realising that I actually missed my old guy self, not the old old ""trying to fit in as a man"" guy self, but the pre-coming out androgynous/bishounen/girly guy self. By putting in so much energy to suppress that part of me to gain acceptance as a female as well as living in an almost non-genuine way to change into some kind of self perceived stereotype of a female, I was causing myself almost a reverse dysphoria. I also began to wonder whether transition was a mistake.

Anyway I stopped HRT, decided I wanted to detransition and went back to dressing as a guy (confusing a lot of people in the process). I felt relieved to let go of the pressure of passing, just rolled out of bed in the morning and throw on jeans and a tshirt, I could speak to people again because...who cares about my voice. My confidence began to come back. My friends continued to treat me as a female and use she/her pronouns and all of that still made me feel nice. After being off HRT for a while I began to feel anxiety, mostly around re-masculinizing and aging as a male (losing my hair, soft features and skin etc.). I hated when my male sex drive kicked in and overall i felt gross in my body. My desires around wanting to be perceived as female also started to return. So I went back on HRT and kind of switched between a boy and a girl mode depending on how confident I felt and what I felt like wearing day-to-day.

After a while my breasts began to grow, not huge (like an A cup), but big enough to be noticeable. I couldnt wear tight shirts and I certainly felt naked when I was topless (which sucked because I grew up on the beach and loved surfing without a shirt). Tbh I hate having breasts most of the time, they feel like really alien and I feel unattractive and awkward having them. I bind them using a tight sports bra most of the time. There are occasions when I do like them, when I'm feeling deeply female and I'm wearing a dress or top that needs filling out, also when I'm at home in my pjs I feel really cute. The biggest time I enjoy them is during sex, the sensations feel amazing and when I'm with a partner I feel like the female in bed. I've never enjoyed sex when I felt like a male.
So over the last year I've cycled on and off hormones. I go off them usually because the breast growth freaks me out and then back on them when the anxiety, ""gross in my body"", ""fear of masculine features returning"" feelings come back. Right atm I am living as my bishounen guy self the majority of the time and bind my chest, I even cut my hair mid length into a cute androgynous style, which has made me feel alot happier. I still have many days or longer periods of time where I really girl up and am happy being seen as female. I am really unsure what to do going from here, whether to go back on HRT forever or stay off them, I'm worried the cycling I'm doing will cause me health problems long term and my endo isn't experienced with someone doing that. My breasts still worry me, I've done some research on top surgery recently and I would be eligible for keyhole because they arn't very big. At the same time I wonder if I would regret having them removed sometimes.

The only other thing that bothers me is that I feel I lost something that was unique to me when I came out as transgender, which I can never get back. I truly miss being that ambiguous guy who was bending all the gender rules, now I feel my unique identity has been taken off me in some way and placed under the transgender label. I don't mean that in a negative way, but that could be partly some internalized transphobia at play. I guess when I was exploring, people saw me as a quirky confident David Bowie type, I was messing with peoples heads and people saw me as one of a kind, ""I don't know what's going on, but he is kind of cool"". After I came out: ""oh she's like Caitlyn Jenner"" or ""I saw a trans story on 60 minutes, you are so brave"", ""it must be so hard"". If I could do it over, I would transition and switch genders without ever coming out and I think my friends would have gone along with that.",genderqueer,"Possibly genderfluid/non-binary, really confused and can't make my mind up about HRT and regret coming out",1501699649.0,"{'created_utc': 1501674449, 'id': '6r3m5k', 'num_comments': 24, 'score': 22, 'selftext': 'Hi all,\nSorry this is super long.

The pressure of being a man again is affecting me so bad (not to feel like transitioning over again),I try hard to be the man I want to be but it seems like I am never enough man...I don't like stereotypical ""man's stuff"" (sports,cars,beer,training,even...girls) I just accepted me as a guy again,a gay guy. I know that as a gay guy I can be as feminine as I want to,but I'm not feminine, yes,I don't like ""masculine"" things and I know more about ""girl's stuff "", I'm right in the middle, I'm not manly or girly enough so now I don't fit in any place;girl's one I get it,I'm a guy and they feel weird,I feel weird too now that I am presenting as a guy again, I'm not a feminine gay guy,I'm not like that at all,I am like an average guy with no manly tastes; I want to have male friends and obviously a boyfriend, but I'm not ""acting"" man enough... 
What should I do? Will I ever be able to find friends like me?A boyfriend?Will I like them? Are there guys like me out there? 
Note: Before starting hrt I hated so bad being a guy because my family and the place I'm living now think that as a guy I have to fix the house problems,carry the heavy stuff, know about all that ""man's stuff "" I mentioned before,etc;I've told my family that they made me hate being a man,to the point of consider it like a curse,that's what actually is causing me gender-social dysphoria.

2017-08-07 04:44:14,6s3e7j,18,22,"Hi there. I'm a butch/tomboy/stag whatever you'd like to call it--AFAB, pretty much cis but with a masc flair. Suits, flannels, no makeup, snapbacks every day, you name it.

And, nah, I'm not trans or genderqueer. I've looked into that, more than once. Shit, sometimes I wonder if that would be better--at least I'd know what the hell is going on with me...better yet, I'd have recourse to stop feeling like shit.

I dress masc, and that's usually enough to keep me feeling good about myself. But on days like this, I see really masc guys and I just feel like shit about myself. I'm not tall enough, not big enough, not strong enough or schooled enough in ""dude know-how"" to hang with a lot of guys. 

I have some friends that are dudes, (not that I choose my friends by gender) but largely they intimidate me. Testosterone is a helluva drug, and it freaks me out that most guys I encounter have the ability to fuck me up if they so chose and I couldn't do much about it. I have crushes on dudes, but I get so freaked that I usually just stick to pursuing girls.

So when I dress the way I do, I feel like I'm dressing as something I'm not--I might look like a guy, but that's where the similarities stop. I'm pretty different from most dudes after that, as much as I hate to think about it. It wouldn't be so bad if I fit in really well with more girls, but I don't do that well either.

I feel like I'm just a random mix of masculine and feminine shit, nothing fits together well. Sometimes I just wish I were different, something less complicated.

I\'m a butch/tomboy/stag whatever you\'d like to call it--AFAB, pretty much cis but with a masc flair. Suits, flannels, no makeup, snapbacks every day, you name it.\n\nAnd, nah, I\'m not trans or genderqueer. I\'ve looked into that, more than once. Shit, sometimes I wonder if that would be better--at least I\'d know what the hell is going on with me...better yet, I\'d have recourse to stop feeling like shit.\n\nI dress masc, and that\'s usually enough to keep me feeling good about myself. But on days like this, I see really masc guys and I just feel like shit about myself. I\'m not tall enough, not big enough, not strong enough or schooled enough in ""dude know-how"" to hang with a lot of guys. \n\nI have some friends that are dudes, (not that I choose my friends by gender) but largely they intimidate me. Testosterone is a helluva drug, and it freaks me out that most guys I encounter have the ability to fuck me up if they so chose and I couldn\'t do much about it. I have crushes on dudes, but I get so freaked that I usually just stick to pursuing girls.\n\nSo when I dress the way I do, I feel like I\'m dressing as something I\'m not--I might look like a guy, but that\'s where the similarities stop. I\'m pretty different from most dudes after that, as much as I hate to think about it. It wouldn\'t be so bad if I fit in really well with more girls, but I don\'t do that well either.\n\nI feel like I\'m just a random mix of masculine and feminine shit, nothing fits together well.

If I offend please know that is not the intent, in my generation and more importantly my family, talking about sexuality is pretty much non-starter.  I am a man and need to marry a woman and create babies, that is the purpose in life; that was pretty much the talk I was given when I was having some issues as a teen.

I am trying to do some more research about my sexuality but cannot correctly identify the term to search for.  I am a male attracted to masculinity (androsexual).  As my close friend put it, I like my women manly.  However, I am also attracted to Transsexual females (gender assigned males that identify as female) that retain the masculine physical presence.   

The commonality between these two is the body type, they have to have masculine physicality while presenting as female.  In other words, no beards or hairy legs but have abs, quads and strong backs.  

I am a masculine guy, lots of gym activities, I like very physical sports (snowboarding, mountain biking, rock climbing, etc...) but feel like sexually I am very feminine.

2017-08-11 01:29:30,6sxxt9,15,6,"This is probably going to end up ridiculously long and tangential. Sorry!?!


AFAB, late-twenties, I basically define myself as ""queer as fuck"" for lack of better words. I am surrounded by queer and trans* folk. My church is welcoming, my friends are welcoming, the larger activist community is welcoming, I spend a good portion of my time in a fairly progressive city (although I do live in a slightly more conservative, but not too bad, smaller town next to the city.)


I just feel like I am running into complications that would prevent me from living like *me*. I don't know what to call myself, but I know a few things for sure. 


I feel like my breasts are the absolute worst thing about my body. They're huge, DD. I wish I could just wake up tomorrow and them be gone. I feel like a lost cause because no matter what else I do as long as those *things* are attached to my body it won't matter. I have severe back pain, neuropathy, sciatica, and asthma. Is it even safe to bind? Like, is it going to make me hurt worse or make it even harder to breathe? I know sometimes if you have very large breasts and chronic pain you can get a reduction. I wonder sometimes if I could convince my doctor that it is medically necessary for that reason alone and not even mention the dysphoria, would they even ""let"" you go down to nothing? I don't know if Medicaid would cover it for either reason though. Plus, as someone with rather severe mental illness, one of my biggest fears in life is surgery. I've been putting off surgery on my back for years for fear and I don't even know if I could make myself do this even though I absolutely hate having breasts. Plus, I'm fat. I'm around 220 and only five feet tall. I'm working on losing weight, but I'm so freakin' depressed that it's hard. I feel like people are going to look at me so weird for having a big old belly/hip and not having *anything* at my chest (either binding or surgery.)


Oh yeah, that's another thing, hips. Damn. I wish I could lose this weight so badly, but I physically and mentally hurt so badly that it is literally hard to move around. The hips ""give it away"" too.


And the hair. I have long hair. Past my shoulders, it's always in a ponytail or bun because I can't be bothered with it. It's super curly. I was just watching some Ash Hardell videos for the first time today and what they said made perfect sense about their hair and dysphoria. One of the reasons I don't just hack it all off is that I'm afraid I will hate it even more than I hate having long hair. I'm afraid it will look ridiculous and I'll be stuck with it until it grows out, partially just because I'm afraid I'll pick the wrong style, but also (again) I'm fat and it's hard to pick the right hairstyles plus my hair is really blonde and for some reason it seems like it's harder to make short blonde hair look good (to me).


Clothing: So, I hate femme clothing. I do not wear any skirts or dresses. I usually walk around in t-shirts and jeans. ""Men's"" clothes don't usually work for me because the chest/hips/belly/shortness so I end up in ""women's"" jeans which is also annoying to me. I also wish I could dress nicer than just t-shirts and jeans, but nothing fits and I can't pull of the majority of semi-dressy button up shirts out there because they're usually plaid of some sort and I end up looking less masculine and more like I'm trying to present butch, which really isn't what I'm going for. 


Hormonal stuff: I loathe having periods. I am trying to get my birth control (which is unnecessary at this point due to my not having sex with someone who can get me pregnant) changed to something that will stop them. I try to keep my voice lower because I don't like the way I sound, but it's definitely not low enough. People still call me ma'am on the phone, even if I don't tell them my name. It's not feminine, but it's definitely not feminine either. (And singing... I love to sing, even though I'm terrible at it, but there goes the low voice out the window.) I don't think I could ever go on T because I have dermatillomania and to a far lesser extent trichotillomania. (I pick my skin and pull my hair.) I have a decent amount of really short chin and mustache hairs already. My mental illness causes me to stand in front of a mirror for extended periods of time plucking if I notice even the slightest feeling of hair coming in. I can't imagine actively trying to grow hair, I feel like I'd never leave the mirror. Which leads me back to, I don't feel like I'm ever going to be able to fully present as a masculine person and it depresses me all over. 


There's probably a whole lot more I could say, but this is basically just free-writing, I need to talk to someone and can't wait any longer kind of thing.


Now, why don't I try to take steps toward a presentation that fits me better?


First off, I'm poor. I can't even afford to buy clothes. I am disabled and waiting on SSI (on a medical leave from work until my doctors say I'm ""better."") My wardrobe basically has to be hand me down and the only people who really give me anything are my sister (and it's always super femme) or my cousin that I live with and it's always super out of style for any gender. I can't afford a binder, I can't afford to keep my hair cut short if I ever go there, I can't afford anything.


Also, I've pared down the number of people I talk to in my family. Out of my dozen or so aunts and uncles and over 40 cousins, my father and my only remaining grandparent, I talk to my sister's, my grandmother and my cousin. But I rely on them so much. I am not in a place right now where I can possibly live on my own, definitely not until SSI goes through. My grandmother still refers to my cousin who has been out as queer and not explicitly out as trans (because my grandmother would not wrap her head around that) but presents male and uses a ""male"" name, etc as their dead name and calls them ""girl/woman"" and it's been a good ten years. I wish I could just leave my grandmother out of my life, but my daughter is *SO* attached to her. My grandmother would disown me and probably try to take her away if I were to say I was queer/GNC. My grandmother is 77 and has Stage 4 Cancer, so she doesn't have much longer anyway, but I can't rip the two of them apart. They love each other too much, plus my grandmother adopted me when I was younger and has let me live with her many times when I was homeless.


My sister and cousin are both members of more conservative denominations of Christianity. They both profess to be accepting of LGBTQ+ people and I know my sister at least supports queer causes and has queer friends, I don't know how far my cousin takes it other than ""God loves everyone"" and ""Everyone deserves equal rights"". I cannot lose either of them. I love them both dearly as people, and for what they've done for me and my daughter. I live with my cousin and have nowhere else to go plus I feel like she needs me around to do things for her (she's got a disability as well that hinders her more than mine does me.) 

Now, my family of creation is large and amazing (as I sort of alluded to above.) I'm not saying this in a way like it's a competition or anything, but I probably associate with far more GNC/Trans* folk than I do cis-folk and nearly everyone I know is under the LGBTQ+ umbrella, so they would all support me in anything. It's just these three people I'm worried about. Well, and society. 

So yeah, I feel stuck right now. I don't think I can do anything and it really hurts. Any tips, advice, or general support would be greatly welcomed. ",genderqueer,Can I Just Vent?

* I was initially uncomfortable the first time I had to change in a locker room in middle school. I got over it, but I always go into a corner away from others when changing, and try to do it as quickly as possible so others don’t see me shirtless.
* I never use urinals in public bathrooms (and often I can’t go at all if someone else is nearby).
* I was never aggressive or competitive growing up, like adolescent boys are seemingly expected to be.
* Sometimes when I am in a stressful situation I start to cry, even if I don’t always know why. I’m glad more people are realizing that the notion of “men shouldn’t show emotions” is ridiculous.
* I have always been upset when I hear about U.S. Selective Service (registering for a wartime draft), because they say it’s a thing all *men* have to do just because you are a *man*. I’m too weak emotionally to be a soldier. I couldn’t kill someone. Even though I know a draft won’t happen because the age of boots-on-the-ground warfare is over and drones and cyberwarfare are the future, it still scares me.
* I have always wanted to wear a women's one piece swimsuit, even though I know it wouldn't work because my junk would be obvious. I'm not exactly ""well-endowed"" down there, but it's enough. I don't really like to swim anymore because it means I have to wear trunks and go shirtless.
* I recently bought a few skirts and leggings on Amazon, and like the look more than pants. I haven't worn them outside my room yet, because my parent's don't know.
* My younger sister is non-binary, and both them and I get upset when my parents use ""her"" pronouns.

And the thought of all the work and risks of transitioning medically makes my head spin. The side effects of HRT, as well as having to get regular blood tests, is intimidating to me. My voice isn't super deep, but unmistakably masculine. I *hate* my growing body hair.

I want to grow my hair long enough to put in a ponytail, and dress more androgynous. I'm bisexual, but I want close friends more than I want a romantic relationship. What worries me is that I still wish I was born female, but am too afraid to fully transition.

2017-08-17 16:45:35,6ub8uv,3,6,"Hey, so I'm 27 and AMAB, I've been questioning since April. However, growing up I never really put much thought into gender, I didn't really know that was a thing I could do haha but going back to 5th/6th grade I always felt so different and broken. It was scary and sort of a relief when I fully grasped and understood what it meant to be transgender. I know I'm definitely not cis and I came out to my parents in July as transgender (did not go well, they love me but don't accept me...) thinking that I wanted to transition and that I was probably fully female just going through a lot of denial. Afterwards I had decided that non-binary trans feminine would be the best term to describe me, but I think I sort of drifted more towards just binary woman later on. But recently after some really low days (why do I always have to hit rock bottom to finally understand myself more...), I started thinking back about my being non-binary and the fluidity of gender. 

I'm thinking now that I'm certainly non-binary but also a bit genderfluid in that for the most part I enjoy feeling agender but there are times where I feel very feminine and want to very much be a girl, so I fluctuate between the two. And while I don't necessarily hate my appearance, I just don't like being viewed as a guy. I wish I could just be read as gender neutral but I don't think I could ever accomplish that at least not without transitioning. Because ultimately I'd prefer to be read as female rather than male. Like I'd certainly like and probably enjoy a more female form with breasts and fat distributed to the butt and hips. And I feel like I'd be a lot happier that way. Because I know as non-binary I can certainly transition but I guess I just wanted to see if there was anyone that could relate to anything of this who has been transitioning and how have you felt about your transition?

I think the only hang ups I really have about transitioning at this point are:

- loss of fertility (but I think if I just bank sperm that should suffice)

- possible loss of friends and family (really unsure how my two cis male roommates would react especially)

- potential awkwardness transitioning at work (though luckily I work for a very LGBTQ friendly company, and there are quite a few people transitioning currently)

- fear that I'll just end up forever looking like a guy with breasts (I like the breast part but not the guy part)

- constant fear of facing hatred and discrimination just for existing.

I am okay a lot of the time with being a woman. If I were to change my pronouns at this point, I would just add on they/ them/ theirs and still use she/ her/ hers, but I realize that might be confusing for some people? I don't know what that makes me, really.

I'm just going to jump right into some things. It was discovered that I have a hormonal imbalance.  I have an abnormally high testosterone count (like 113 or something) for a woman and I wasn't getting my period because of it (I don't have PCOS or any tumors, it's just abnormally high for unknown reasons - any insight as to why that could be and if that could be affecting me?). I only get my period when I'm on birth control at this point. I went back on birth control, got my period, and I was a wreck the whole month with emotions and got really bad dysphoria with my period. Like it was this foreign thing that I shouldn't be getting. I've had that a lot in the past, and I don't know if it's because I have gone really long stretches without getting it, or if it's connected to concerns about gender, or if it's because it's normal for women to hate their period. But it just didn't feel right. I was supposed to keep taking birth control, but I didn't, and didn't tell my doctor. I even asked to go on a different medication, not even voicing my concerns completely, just saying that my emotions and migraines were out of control. But now she says this other medication (metformin, which is actually a medication for diabetes, which I don't have but helps balance hormones) might give me my period, and it might help me lose weight  - but now I'm thinking of asking to just go back on the birth control or do nothing because even though I need help losing weight (huge issue for me), it's not worth having my period and not having the option to skip it.

Another thing. TW: I was raped about a year ago. It really messed me up bad. I have PTSD because of it. I'm in therapy and see a psychiatrist. I was already doing that but it also caused me to be hospitalized three or four times. I've already struggled with depression, anxiety, and past abuse. Anyway, I wonder if some ""dysphoria"" I have with my breasts could actually be tied to the rape and how bruised they got, and how maybe it's just a huge trigger now. I used to be fine with that part of me. It now just makes me feel terrible when anyone is looking at my chest or sexualizing me as a woman. I never feel like a guy but I kind of want to disappear, even though at the same time I wish my boyfriend and I were having sex even though our sex life is non-existent and we're poly, and I'm scared to even try to seek out someone else.

Lately I've looked up binders and wondered how that would make me feel. I never want to be a guy. However, sometimes I really feel uncomfortable with my womanly features, or at least my chest and my long hair (I'm trying to get my hair cut really soon into some sort of side cut asymmetrical bob I think), and from what I've seen online/ on tinder, I'm really attracted to women/ people who have androgynous looking genders? I hope that doesn't sound offensive. I find myself being attracted but also wishing I looked like that and wanting to emulate it. I wonder if this is a new thing or if it's been there for a long time and I'm just now acknowledging it. I've always struggled with what to wear when I go out and some days I've dressed a certain way but some days I've dressed in a way that makes me ""comfortable"" and it leans more towards androgynous. 

I have found myself lately wanting more androgynous clothing and wanting to look that way more? I've reasoned it to not wanting excess attention from guys and it being a comfort thing but I don't know if it's necessarily a negative thing in that way. I don't know if maybe it means that I just feel more comfortable being androgynous. Sometimes I still like dressing up but a lot of the time I don't. Idk.

But at the same time, I love makeup?

I think a lot of disappointment in my body is weight related. Maybe I'd be more comfortable being womanly if I wasn't overweight. But I'm not sure. Also a lot of it is related to my sexuality I feel like, and having finally come out as bisexual after hiding for so long. I feel more comfortable dressing a certain way, maybe not as feminine, because I don't have to necessarily hide who I am.

Currently I present as male about 96% of the time, very rarely androgynously or feminine.

These are the tops I looked at:

- [H&amp;M grey cropped Top](http://www2.hm.com/en_gb/productpage.0509135002.html). The MSRP online is £1.99, but in-store [from when I looked today] it was £5.99 on the label, so what's the actual price?

- [H&amp;M cropped top](http://www2.hm.com/en_gb/productpage.0509135003.html). As above with the pricing issue.

I am a 5""9 AMAB and want to try and look a bit more feminine with these, their gray and white colors are at least a start - I'm trying to start small, take it slowly. I am masculine in look and build.

In terms of male clothing sizes, I'm usually medium.

At the moment, I'm not out about being genderfluid/androgynous for fear my parents wouldn't understand [I also have Asperger's Syndrome as well, but that's probably not relevant as much here].

Where should I start regarding tops like this and looking slightly more feminine and looking androgynous?

I would appreciate any advice and suggestions on this.",genderqueer,"How to find clothing that fits [AMAB, genderfluid, 30/M, United Kingdom].",1504157491.0,"{'created_utc': 1504132291, 'id': '6x2sgv', 'num_comments': 12, 'score': 11, 'selftext': 'I\'ve started to think about how to express my androgyny/genderfluidity, and having found some idea of what I like [colors mostly being greys and blacks] I\'m uncertain of how to find clothing that\'s the right size for this.\n\nCurrently I present as male about 96% of the time, very rarely androgynously or feminine.\n\nThese are the tops I looked at:\n\n- [H&amp;M grey cropped Top](http://www2.hm.com/en_gb/productpage.0509135002.html).
