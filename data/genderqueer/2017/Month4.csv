I thought I'd share my experience with you all so that it may serve as another data point for you if you're considering something similar. I'm not at all advocating any specific course of action for anyone else - all I can speak of is my own experience.

Some background: I work at a small (30 people) startup based in NYC, although I generally work remotely. I've been working there for a year, over which I've been changing my outward presentation.

I was planning on coming into the office on Friday, so I asked the CEO in advance if we could schedule a short chat first thing in the morning, reassuring him that there wasn't any bad news. Once we were face-to-face I told him that my gender identity had been changing over the last several years, and that I am genderqueer and my pronouns were they/them. He said something to the effect of ""That's great, is there anything you need from me?"" I told him that all I needed was for him to use my proper pronouns and back me up if necessary.  I told him that I had prepared a short email to send out to the rest of the staff, and asked him if he wanted me to share it with him first. He told me to just go ahead and send it.

Here's the note I sent:
&gt; Hi fellow [company name]-ists,
&gt; So I'm writing you all to let you know of a change that's been going on for me over the past year or so. I'll try to keep it short (-ish).
&gt;
&gt; I've come to find that my gender identity isn't quite what I thought it was. My gender is nonbinary and genderqueer. I'm not male or female. You may (or may not) have noticed that I've been looking a little different lately. That's what's going on.
&gt;
&gt; The only change that I'm asking from all of you is to use my new pronouns, which are [""they"" / ""them"" / ""their.""](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/singular-nonbinary-they) I appreciate your understanding with regards to this.
&gt;
&gt; So, at this point, all of you know me at least a little bit, and I hope this doesn't change anything in our working relationship. Also, I'm open to answering any clarifying questions you might have. 
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,

After I sent that, I got several replies from coworkers that were very short and sweet, to the effect of ""Sure, no problem.""

Furthermore, my sexuality (mostly interested in cis/trans women.  I'm not a chaser though; I don't prefer one over the other) makes me afraid for my ability to find a partner were I to transition.  Part of what led to my own understanding of my gender came from reflecting on the fact that I've exclusively dated bisexual/queer women.  I'm sure they all knew on some level that I was not the gender I expressed far before I came to those conclusions myself.  So I seem to have discovered a way to feel comfortable in my sexuality without needing to explicitly project my gender (except, on occasion, in the bedroom ;).

I also don't experience classic gender dysphoria.  I'm not appalled by my genitalia, but I often fantasize about what it would be like if they were different.

I often wish that there was some kind of socially acceptable ""third"" gender.

Go to work in unisex outfits, and save my more feminine attire for when the mood strikes me.  The world would see me as an effeminate man, but not a man who's trying to be a woman.  Is this even possible?  Or am I crazy?

Would I be able to find a partner if I did this?  Even without the hormones, would women still find me attractive were I to express my gender androgynously?  Is there a precedent for male-sexed people attempting this?  

Any advice would be greatly appreciated; I'm genuinely at a loss regarding how to proceed.  And for the record, just because I don't plan on altering my genitalia doesn't make me cis.

I've been questioning my gender for a while now. It started after my best friend came out as genderfluid, and this made me look more critically at my own gender and I've been kinda confused... 

So, I've always been masculine (I'm afab). Even since I was little I always preferred ""boy's"" clothes and interests associated with boys and masculinity. I vaguely remember thinking that I wished I was a boy back then too (although I no longer feel that way now that I know NB genders are a thing) though I think that was because I didn't like the things usually associated with girls, or act ""like a girl"". I had very long hair until two years ago and I always hated it so after I cut it was much happier and more confident in my appearance because I looked more like how I envisioned myself. 

During puberty I hated having boobs. I tried to ignore it but I could only do that so long. When my mum took me bra shopping for the first time I just started crying afterwards. Like, proper sobbing. These days I'm more comfortable with my chest but there are days when I wish it was flat, and I'm only comfortable with it when I'm wearing loose fitting shirts - which are the only type I ever wear now. I'm planning on getting a binder at some point. My voice is quite deep for someone who's afab (If anyone has played Batman: Arkham Asylum, I can reach Batman's pitch fairly easily) which I really like. I used to dislike having a deeper voice than other girls but I've grown to really enjoy it because I feel like it suits me more. I still find myself wishing I had a more masculine figure however. 

There's days when I identify a lot with being a woman and days when I feel weird about the term being used to refer to me. I don't feel like a man, just really masculine or somewhere in between when I'm not feeling so much like a woman on those days. I'm cool with most pronouns being used and when people mistake me for a boy I'm not too bothered by it, and if I confuse them about my gender then that's perfect. I really like looking androgynous most days. Sometimes not, but most days I do. Sometimes when I've had to count how many girls are, say, going to a friends house, I'd be like ""oh yeah, I'm a girl"". Like I forget that other people consider me a girl and would count me as such?

I've heard the term demigirl - or demigender - and I think it maybe fits but I'm not sure. 

tl;dr: Afab person questioning gender. I'm cool with all pronouns but have times where I feel 100% female and times where I feel a tiny bit female but also neutral or in between.

2017-04-07 06:28:54,63yrbd,10,20,"Big frustrated 2:30 AM rant ahead. Sorry.

Honestly, using the ""kids nowadays"" thing might not make sense given my age (I'll be 18 on Sunday), but take into account the fact that I grew up in a super rural, intensely religious area in western NC. For example: The first time I used the internet was when I was in sixth grade, and it was at the one computer in the library that had the AR tests on it. I didn't use the internet for personal use until I was in high school. I pretty much spent most of my youth, internet-wise, in the equivalent of the early early early internet days.

Anyway, here's my point:  
I'm super fucking envious of all the resources that gender non-conforming youth have now that I never really did. Due to lack of exposure, I didn't even know being transgender was a *thing* until Caitlyn, *and I'm NB trans*. Just taking YouTubers into account, there's Tyler Oakley, Hannah Hart, Skylar Kergil, Jamie Raines, Miles McKenna, and oodles more. People the same age and older than me got to see these people, learn that the way they were was okay, maybe even find support and get on androgen blockers or present as their preferred gender without fear of retaliation from their family. Hell, since was stuck in a fucking time loop for most of my childhood (to the point where I only knew LGB existed and hadn't even heard the acromym), I just chalked up the dysphoria and the lack of sexual interest in others (both of which were and are signs of my asexuality and transness) to, respectively: the idea that, since I was more comfortable hanging with girls, I naturally emulated them to a degree; and me just being a ""late bloomer"" (TMI: this caused me to be sexual with people I really am not a fan of even platonically out of the hopes that I'd ""kickstart"" my sexuality).

I don't really know what the point of this post is. Hell, since 80% of the US lives in urban areas and most of Reddit is late teens/early twenties, most of you guys probably won't even be able to sympathize with this because you *did* have internet access and the like growing up. Idk. It just feels like being rural, poor, and queer isn't really noticed. It's not like it's an active ignorance, it's just that we're *far* from a majority even in the LGBT+ community.

Honestly, it's gotten to the point development wise that I'm debating whether or not getting HRT is even worth it. I look *way* too much like my sex for there to be any doubt ever what I was born as unless I undergo some serious surgery, but even then what's the point? Ugh. Idk.

2017-04-07 18:17:47,6424pl,11,25,"I'm AFAB and always ""felt different"" from ""other girls"". 

I found out I wanted to kiss girls and thought that must be why. But it didn't make everything make sense. 

I have not begun HRT and don't know that I will. I have not had any SRS. 

I started reading about gender / trans stuff when I was 18. My girlfriend at the time had CAH, a form of intersex, and the way she talked about gender made me realize that there was more than being a boy or a girl. I ID'd as genderqueer and trans* and, orientation, as bisexual or queer. 

I do not have significant body dysphoria. Not coincidentally Idon't think, my body is tall and flat chested. I do not hate my vagina or my small breasts. My face is feminine but has the capacity for androgyny. If I could be read as perfectly androgynous and gendered male, female, and non-binary equally, I would be so happy. I am always read as female. I am annoyed but resigned about this. 

I am in a long term relationship with a man who is trans, and somewhat, usually privately, gender nonconforming. He has always known I am genderfluid. My gender feels at core neither male nor female, but is somewhat reactive to the gender of the person I am with romantically or sexually. Somewhat ironically for how much I am sexually attracted to queerness, I tend to feel ""girly"" when I'm with my boyfriend, and more ""boy-y"" when I'm with my female sweetheart (polyamorous woo!).

""Feeling like a girl"" and ""feeling like a boy"" feel exactly as genuine to me -- that is to say, both feel thrillingly performative but not insincere. Because of my physiology and gender expression, as I generally wear clothing that is gendered as ""for women"", I am read as a cis woman pretty much all the time. 

I don't think that it hurts me when I am misgendered/limitedly gendered as ""she"". It feels wrong, but not entirely wrong. Recently I have asked my close ones to use they/them/their pronouns with me, which feels more right, but something is still off. (Very rarely do people refer to me as he/him/his; whenever it happens I am thrilled, but I believe that if it were to happen as consistently as she/her/hers does, I would feel similarly: ""not quite right, yo, but I guess close enough."")

I recently described myself as non-binary and trans (I'm 31 now) and my boyfriend was not having it. Because I am gender fluid, AFAB, and ""enough of a girl"" that she/her/hers pronouns from stranger/those not close to me don't cause me severe pain, just a little itchiness, it was not how he perceives non-binary and trans. I feel like since my default gender is NOT female or male and that she/her/hers are not my ideal pronouns, I am not appropriating trans or non-binary identity when I use these words. We are both worried about impact more than intent -- if a cis person learns that I consider myself trans, but knows/assumes that I am AFAB and has not heard me request pronouns other than she/her/hers, that cis person is far more likely to misgender non-binary people in particular, but potentially binary trans people as well.

I'm in my first professional, post-college job. Before this, I did jobs that felt a lot more temporary, so I wasn't really as concerned about things like networking or what people thought of me. I work as a staff member at a US university that's relatively liberal, or at least has several bubbles that are very liberal. I'm not the only non-binary employee at this university. The department I work in isn't specifically related to gender/sexuality, but is focused on an area of scholarship related to minority experiences, so a lot of the faculty I work with are pretty liberal and mindful of social justice but I don't have a good sense of how that transfers over to their personal views of trans people aside from the fact that they're not actively hostile. I'm pretty sure none of them know that I identify as trans, but at least some of them have probably figured out that I'm in the LGBTQ community.

I've made some networking ties with other LGBTQ employees who know how I identify, and I've taken part in some activities where my pronouns and identification have come up naturally, and I've been open about it. 

But it hasn't come up naturally with the people I work with most often, and I'm not sure if I need to formally broach the topic or if I should just wait until I'm closer to making a decision about medically transitioning (if I start testosterone, I'll certainly have to say something). The thing is, I hate formally coming out, and I'm not extremely bothered by being misgendered and don't normally feel like correcting people if they use the wrong pronouns or call me ""ma'am,"" even if it does bug me sometimes.

2017-04-12 21:15:43,6512n7,2,2,"Hello, y'all. This is my first time posting to this subreddit. More than ever I can think of, the last few months I've been questioning my gender a lot more. I dunno if it's because I'm interested in reading about many gender identities that it's so hard for me to describe what I feel, as a nanoboy, schrödinboy, agender, genderfluid, I can't f-ing tell, but I can clearly tell that 1) being viewed as a boy makes me feel uncomfortable, and 2) I'm not a girl. I'm AMAB and I don't dress ambiguously... I mean, I don't really care for what I wear as long as it minimized how much I sweat and keeps disease-transmitting mosquitoes from biting my legs - they mostly fly low. So probably everyone else can think I'm a cis boy unless they objectively ask me how I identify myself - to which the honest answer is ""IDK.""
The times I doubt of my so-called male identity are the times I'm being the most social with the most people at once, i.e. at a family meeting or party, since I'm not really that social. I may feel weird at times for going into the boys room, but I'm used to it by now; but I felt really out of place once I went to the male WC while traveling with my family and that whole day I felt more and more disconnected from ""being a boy.""
My first thought was that I might me agender, but that'd be easier to accept solely because I'm also asexual and aromantic, and I ave created an agender character for a comic I'm working on, but it doesn't really seem to represent me.
I have thought in the past I might be pangender. Experiencing multiple genders, in this case all genders, at once is an easy concept for me to assimilate, and I find it annoying when people limitate what I could feel - why does my mom think my cousin might be trans becuase he's into crossdressing and drag, but she doesn't notice her own son doesn't enjoy being called a ""real man?"" Is that so unquestionable that I can't feel something else than being a boy?
But I didn't get that ""that's so me"" feeling about pangender as I did when I accepted my asexuality and aromanticity (or aromanticism, if you will).
I have read about greygender, because it seemed like me at first sight, but not really when I did some further research. I have then reached cassgender (did I spell it correctly?), as in someone whose gender identity is described as not caring about their own gender in their life. And one of the people who were writing about it said they also thought they might be pangender before, do I felt closer to that.
I have recently found out I'm an aspie - i.e. in the autism spectrum, so I'd be interested in knowing more about some neurogenders.

2017-04-14 01:22:34,659ozz,2,7,"Not to be dramatic, just quoting Final Fantasy X. Wasn't sure how to title this (Also my first time ever posting on Reddit). I'll be honest, I'm not really sure what do I hope to archieve with this, but I guess I can't lose anything at trying... also forgive my english if there's something that sounds weird (Venezuelan)

I'm a 25 years old guy who wants to be a woman, struggling with therapists because I believe that everything they believe is a lie. Also living in a country were it was thought as a great idea to put a Bus Driver as President.

My mother told me: ""I believe these features socialy called /femenine/ and /masculine/ exist within you at a complete balance. In such a way that you can't notice them as two different things, or you can't notice them at all. You have an incapacity to see gender, like if you were born without being able to.""

My father on the other side, can't understand the fact that I'm attracted to women. For him (and many) is common belief that what a transgender wants to archieve, is having a more comfortable homosexual life, so ""if you're not gay, then why?"", but as much as he doesn't get it, he unconditionally supports me (and is paying for everything)

So, yeah.. those are two things that many can only dream about, the understanding from your mother, and not-as-much but unconditional support from your father. Don't get me wrong, I'm really grateful for that, but... I should start from the beginning: 

Ever since I was a boy, I never understood these ""Girly things"", ""Boy things"", nor the intensity which people divided themselves by such trivialities. As I grew older I could only assumed that people loved to search for excuses to justify this concept called ""Gender"". And I really began to hate it, and everything gender-related.

As I grew even older, I let myself see other side of it. History + Social Media + Social Indoctrination traditionaly given by our parents, and their parents to them = Gender is not even there, not outside the conceptual plane, not outside people thoughts... ""Gender doesn't exist"" was the best closure I found.

For me, the difference between men and women, it's a ""wo"" ......nope I know, I was starting to feel that I was being really heavy/intense in my own anti-gender way, so wanted to make a really bad joke. (The intensity will keep rising tho.) *it's pure anatomy. It is hard for me to believe or understand that there is such thing as ""Feeling like a woman"", if not even women themselves fulfill the norm at 100%. 

It is easier for me to believe that people are victims of an ancient brain wash. And I'm really sorry if that offends someone, I don't believe myself to be better than others, I'd really love to explain why I'm immune, like a recipe ""Drink this and you won't be able to see gender anymore"" really I'd love to, but I can't.

Having said all that, my problem starts when I say ""I want to be a woman"". What I want is a change of ""case"", because what are our bodies if not ""vessels"" for our souls? (or ""Essence"", how I like to call it) I have quite defined what changes I want in my body, body which I was never comfortable with, and always found comfort/envy with the one of a woman. And actually, for better or worse, after years of building piece by piece the body I wish for, it fits 100% with ""Female Anatomy"". 

I know what I want, my parents knows, my dog knows, my friends knows.. everyone supports me, some better than others, but I have full support on my social environment. So what stops me? That I can't turn into a woman by myself, if we could, this thread wouldn't even exist.

So, I found out about a Medical Team that treats trans people (The only one in my country). I called them on January 9th, and I've been seeing them since then. I wanted them to help me to start my HRT, but I was a naive genderblind genderqueer/agender that always had found support from friend an family, what could possibly go wrong? :D(?)

I must rewind a bit, because I did took therapy with a psychologist for year and a half (She is Pure Love), and she never faced me with  ""No you don't"" nor she ever thought I was crazy or anything. She was the one who gave me number of this Team ""For when you want to make the next step"". Also, I had to stop the therapies because she gave birth, nowadays she's so busy as a Mom and still can't return to work because of that.

At that moment what stopped me was that neither of my parents knew. I wanted to call after I passed those Final Bosses, as I thought of them, like ""Once I defeat them (have them on my side) nothing else matters"". So yes, it was January 5th when I talked with my father, and everything went soomthly. I only waited a few days because 9th was the first working monday of the year.

Back to the Medical Team. This is... quite long as it is, but we are now at the climax. I'll try to go directly to facts.

- The Director recieved me, and we talked for about 4 hours, highly understanding me.
- At his order, I had some blood exams and asked my former psychologist for a report.
- Once I got those things, (also by his order) I went to see the one in charge of hormones, Dr.Cabeza 'e Ñame (""Head of Yam"", that's how my friends calls him, don't ask me how Yam is an insult, venezuelan slang)
- After a few sessions with Cabeza 'e Ñame, he asks:""But, what are you doing here?"" (Meaning: at his office.) 
- Meaning: He never understood a thing about me, he thought I was crazy, he actually acknowledged it once
- I never want to see Cabeza 'e Ñame again in my life. And I went to talk with the Director about it, again hours talking.
- He told me not to worry, that he was going to speak with him, that Cabeza 'e Ñame WILL help me.
- So I waited, but got dates cancelled because of reasons.
- In the wait (about weeks) I couldn't help to think about my humiliating experiences with him, and I began to hate him and more every day that passed. ""So what? When the time comes, and I go to see him again... will I gave him a smile? or I would scream the **** out of him? What's the point of this wait?""
- Also I found out that Cabeza 'e Ñame was going to take Ñame Vacations the whole month of April, so my wait was going to wait until May :D
- I went to talk with the Director again, not a happy talk. ""I regret having met you all"" I said. (Which was sad, because the Director is nice :c)
- But then, the Director decided to take a leap of faith, and went outside protocols.
- ""Forget Cabeza e' Ñame, you will meet with our psychologist for psychological support, but I'll send you to another endocrine who will start your HRT immediately""
- So I did, I've seen the psychologist twice, who is a more understanding person, and the endocrine indeed gave me, not a dose, but a prescription of hormones to search and hoping to gather up to 3-4 months.
- Once I gather it, I'll meet again with the endocrine, so I can finally begin my HRT.

The thing is, I'm not quite happy, I feel really weird, it's like a bitter victory. For two reasons:

1. There's a factor that you can't really understand if you don't live here. In Venezuela we have shortage of everything, I've found blockers, but it seems hormones are not found anywhere.. just as you don't always find bread, eggs, milk, sugar, etc. at the markets. I haven't lose hope, as we have holiday the whole week because of Christ (Yes, the whole week) So next week I'll keep searching. And I have family/friends on USA and Europe, who I guess could help, I do have a prescription after all.

2. The thing that more worries me, is that both psychologist and endocrine, are waiting/expecting/asking for me to talk ""femenine"" or express myself other ways, more like a woman. And I'm not looking to train myself to fit into society, I'm ""me"". And /me/ thinks of pronouns like just grammar, I'm not a woman yet so I don't want to be ""she"", and again, my family and friends are with me, they won't call me ""she"" until the time is right. It seems all trans that this Team have treated are binary to the core, and had followed that training even without being asked to. So it's all they know, there is A and B, not C allowed, which are you? The Director seems to be more open about it, but this protocol is a complete mess.

Like I said, I'm not sure why I'm telling my story, nor I dunno how many will actually read it. This was by no means written in order to harm anyone (Only Cabeza e' Ñame), so I apologize if /you/ who read this, are criticized or offended by my words. Please feel free to comment whatever you want. 

I do wonder, does it works like this in every place on Earth? There are actual medical teams that support Non-Binary? I might be wrong, but: it seems to me that Binary Trans have it more easy, ""I'm a woman trapped in the body of a man"" and you're ready.. I just can't understand how every trans (at least treated with this Team) wants to sit the same specific way, or talk the same, or dress the same, how about inviduality?

2017-04-15 12:37:06,65ive3,9,5,"Yesterday, in another fit of anger at myself for not being able to let this topic go, I realized that I've been questioning whether or not T might be for me since December last year. And I haven't really gotten any closer to the answer. It's wearing me the hell out.

I've been identifying as non-binary for years now, and until that point where I started being more active in the reddit trans community, T has never been an option for me. I went through puberty excited about my body showing signs of growing up. My dysphoria, which only really became noticable after I realized I was non-binary, is largely social. The body dysphoria I have is usually based on that. Not ""having breasts is wrong"", but ""having breasts makes people see me as female and that's wrong"". I also don't have a very curvy body in general.

I don't know what changed. Maybe it's that I started looking more at transition timelines, experiences, and images of binary trans men. Maybe I've been internalizing some notion that since everyone on reddit is taking hormones, I need to do it too or I'm not really trans. Maybe I'm just some delusional cis girl and I'm taking it to the extreme to get attention. I don't know what it is, but T is suddenly on the forefront of my mind.

I know the changes sound appealing. I know that I've had other qualms with taking masculinizing steps solely for attention, like with cutting my hair, and I'm really happy I did these things after all. I started wearing men's clothes that hide my body shape and it makes me ecstatic, but mostly because it feels like it might make people see me as non-female, or to confuse them about my sex. I've been unable to wear make-up, skirts, or even dress my Animal Crossing character femininely because it makes me so uncomfortable. I also look at some men and know that if pressing that one hypothetical button would make me look like them, I'd instantly press it.

But then there's that other side of me. The side that's scared that my brain sex is female and T will make me depressed. The side that looks at the conventionally masculine, muscular body on the H&amp;M underwear packaging and shudders at the thought of looking like that. The side whose goal was always to be able to look androgynous, female, and male at will, the side that's scared of losing that possibility with T. The side that's scared of hating being called a man and not being able to find a therapist who is knowledgable about NB identities. The side that would do this if the neutral gender marker was introduced in my country but that doesn't have the money to change it twice.

I honestly don't know what to do. I've read the advice that hormones should only be taken if you're sure about them a thousand times... But something about saying ""nope, T is not for me"" makes me anxious. Maybe I just don't feel valid as a trans person if I don't take it... but maybe that's a form of dysphoria in and of itself. My current therapist doesn't know anything about gender and I need her to help with my other mental health issues, so I'm stuck anyway.

The side that would do this if the neutral gender marker was introduced in my country but that doesn\'t have the money to change it twice.\n\nI honestly don\'t know what to do. I\'ve read the advice that hormones should only be taken if you\'re sure about them a thousand times... But something about saying ""nope, T is not for me"" makes me anxious. Maybe I just don\'t feel valid as a trans person if I don\'t take it... but maybe that\'s a form of dysphoria in and of itself. My current therapist doesn\'t know anything about gender and I need her to help with my other mental health issues, so I\'m stuck anyway.\n\nIf anyone\'s been in a similar situation and can commiserate, if you were unsure and found a solution you\'re happy with, please, feel free to comment.

I am an AMAB Genderqueer person from Hungary, Europe. I have a very masculine body in which I'm not feeling very comfortable because I think it doesn't reflect my gender identity.

For the past year or so I've been taking progressively more serious steps to have a more androgynous body. I shave all of my body hair and crop my hair very short, almost bald, I'm using women's beauty care products, most importantly moisturizing and skin-softening creams and training my voice to be less deep.

So far, I'm having some limited success, but I think HRT would help a lot in further reaching an androgynous body.

Would you recommend HRT for me or would you be against it? What are your opinions and why?

Another difficulty I have is that in Hungary you have to have a psychiatrist's prescription to get hormones. From chatting with Hungarian trans people, it seems to me that although most psychiatrists here support binary trans people in transitioning, I don't know how they would react to me, who is non-binary and only want hormones to have a less masculine, more androgynous body. I'm afraid they would immediately switch into gatekeeper-mode and deny me their prescription.

2017-04-17 02:53:29,65t49k,0,2,"Hey, all. I'm kind of nervous since this is my first post and my first time talking about anything like this, but I really need some help with figuring all of this gender stuff out.

I've had gender issues for most of my life. Even as a little girl, when I presented as very feminine, I found it much more fulfilling to hang with the boys on the playground, and acted as masculine as I could. I never gave much thought to my appearance or felt strange calling myself feminine, though, even until middle school.

Middle school gave rise to the majority of the gender issues. I'm very short and dainty, which I've always liked, but I had to cut my hair into a pixie cut in order to feel capable of facing the world. I figured out I was bi in middle school, had an existential crisis, bought a binder, and started wearing men's clothing on occasion. I never worried about being perceived as too masculine. For a while, I identified as genderfluid. Eventually, however, the phase of masculinity faded, and I gradually gravitated back toward being a cis female. I was comfortable, and forgot about gender almost entirely, dismissing the fluidity as a middle school phase.

I spent two years of high school growing out my hair. When it reached my shoulders, I realized how much I hated it. I had unconsciously started wearing more masculine clothing whilst growing it out, and stopped wearing makeup (though I still very much enjoyed wearing it when I did find time to put some on). I knew immediately that I wanted to cut it all off again, but waited for a few months, wondering if the phase would pass again. It didn't, so I chopped everything off to above my ears. The first time I did it, it was a sense of relief, but this time, there was none. Now I'm wondering whether the cut was a mistake.

Throughout the course of my senior year, I've a) lost weight, and lost some of my curves as a result, b) chopped off my hair, c) quit wearing makeup, for the most part, d) realized I hate shaving, and stopped unless it's necessary (ex: prom is coming up), and e) started singing tenor and alto interchangeably in my school's choir. However, I'm having INTENSE dysphoria. It seems like nothing I do with my body fits.

I'm not a boy. I don't want to be mistaken as such. I've always considered myself to have a feminine identity, but now I'm questioning that. I hate being clean shaven but I also hate my naturally coarse body hair. I want body hair, but I want it to be soft and relatively unnoticeable. I hate my curves, and at the same time, love the way my body looks overall. I hate my low voice and singing tenor, but at the same time, I love it. I have wide shoulders, which I despise. I'm utterly lost and can't seem to find a label that fits. I hate feminine clothing, but I also hate masculine clothing that hides my natural body. I want to look androgynous but am intensely uncomfortable when I do. I don't want my long hair back, but I hate my short hair, and I also don't want no hair. I have awful dysphoria about having a uterus; my external genitalia is fine, and I actually kind of love it, but the internal stuff is horrifying and makes me squeamish thinking about it. Over the past few months, I've talked to my best friend more times than I can count about how much I just want to exist as an incorporeal entity and float around to my classes, so the body issues will go away. 

I seem to swing between feminine and agender or androgynous (I apologize if the terminology is wrong, I haven't done a ton of research yet), and am currently stuck in both simultaneously.

Does anyone have any advice on how to cope with the dysphoria for now? For now, all I've found that helps is purple lipstick and longer, more masculine styled shorts.

Any recommendations on what I could do to figure out what gender I could identify with would be welcome, as well.

I have never felt that my gender mattered? I don't care if people refer to me as a girl, I wouldn't care if someone called me a boy either. Sometimes when people slip up and call me sir it makes me smile though.

I was really masculine as a child (I pretended to be a boy from ages 5-8) and all the way up to around age 18. I always had short hair, and wore mostly men's clothes. I don't know why I decided to grow my hair out and buy more feminine clothing, but I did.

I don't have dysphoria I dont think? When I was a teen I had some issues with looking feminine and would freak out and shave my head if I thought I looked too girly. That happened about 3 times total. If I could pick though, I would want to look genderless and inhuman. The thought of people looking at me and being confused about my gender makes me really happy. I don't think I have physical dysphoria either, I have body image issues because I have an eating disorder. But I believe that's a separate entity.

I'm into body modification, and plan to become heavily modded in the future, primarily things that make me look more alien (tongue split, maybe a bellybutton removal etc.). But for some reason I have been thinking about gender on and off for the past few years.

I talked to my boyfriend, who told me he assumes I lean towards being NB. Aparently I talk more about wanting to be genderless alien more than I thought.

I don't feel comfortable identifying as non binary though?

So I kind of feel like a faker, or just someone who has a bad self worth...

The more I think the more it seems I might not be cis at least? I don't feel like cis people get upset and question their gender for years like I have. But I really just don't know anymore.... I guess I'm just freaking out. I just feel like since i dont have intense dysphoria like my binary trans friends I'm not really nonbinary.

""For instance, if you singled out a cis woman for a funny prank and decided to call her “he” all the time, give her “bro hugs”, and otherwise interact with her in a male way (being more physically and verbally rough, swearing around her more, calling her “man” at the end of every sentence, verbally sparring with her, etc), you can imagine she would feel offended.""

Then I realized this happens with ten times more intensity with men than with women! I long to be bro-hugged, clapped on the shoulder, to have my hair tousled (not in my current body though because the first two would trigger my intense chest dysphoria and the third wouldn't work with my long hair).

2017-04-22 01:45:19,66tgzf,1,13,"Well tomorrow celebrates my one month anniversary of coming out but I can't wait to post this lol. Even though I only did so to a small group of friends and plan to slowly add more trustworthy people (more on that later). So thought I'd share my experience the last month.


    1. Making the post/reactions

The most stressful part of all was hitting ""post"" and waiting for the responses which I quickly jumped to respond to. I actually posted it twice since the first time nobody said anything but they liked it. Again, everyone was 100% supportive and totally cool with it, and in fact I've become somewhat closer to them.

    2. Expressing myself outside

I experimented with certain clothes and products outside of the safety if my room (nail polish, women's skinny jeans, some makeup) and nobody said a thing or took a second look (it's college so I guess that makes sense). I'm still quite nervous about going out with full outfits and whatnot but taking baby steps is easier.


    3. Harassment 

This is the ""more on that"". About 2/3 weeks ago I got a random text where a person I wasn't out to, found out. All this time later I've gotten numerous texts from different numbers (I'm assuming fake numbers) telling me a whole bunch of stuff ranging from ""die"" to ""I've seen your posts about me on [private instagram]"". I can care less about the insults and what not, my main concern is just finding out who this is. I have different theories but none of them make much sense (I can make another post regarding that if y'all want). It caused a friendship to end. It's hard talking about it to everyone since I'm not out to everyone, and I don't feel comfortable telling the police (although if it gets serious I will). Best bet is change my number for a 2nd time.


    4. It still feels weird...

Even a month after coming out it still feels weird making those posts and sharing the pictures of the genderqueer me. A friend mentioned it's because for all this time it's been a secret so my brain is still used to it like that. Also since coming out I've had less dysphoria, and if I do it comes not as often.

-------------------------------

I still have an interesting journey ahead of me. Next semester I plan on joining my LGBT club at school (I signed up this semester but haven't heard a thing :/), I plan on telling more people (but since #3 I'm going to be very selective), go shopping for more female clothes (because I have one outfit) and start to go out more with friends in my female side once summer break starts and everyone is home.

2017-04-24 01:49:12,6767px,0,2,"okay so this is a throwaway account because I frequent the FTM and transgender subs and am afraid of backlash. I am on here as well. but here goes. 

Okay so i began questioning my gender identity about two years ago. I became very anxious, dissociative, and depressed. 
It started really randomly while I was smoking weed. And I just thought.. why do I feel like a dude right now? I'm AFAB. 
anyway I've been basically obsessing  about it for the last two years. literally everyday. all day. I rarely have a normal chain of thought and it's definitely taken a toll. dysphoria for me has gradually worsened over this time.
Anyway I came to the conclusion a couple of times that I'm ftm... while like hoping that I gender queer? if that makes sense. I guess I saw this as an easier route and it seemed to fit my overall personality. I just don't ""feel like a girl"" at all. There were times where I ""felt like a man"" But i don't really have a desire to BE a man. anyway. around that time (2 years ago)  I began referring to most people as human or person without consciously doing so.
 And would probably rather prefer people refer to me as that as well but I appear female so I get called she. 
But also the more I think about it the more i find it strange to address people by their genitals but thats the world we live in.

I also want to note that at one point when talking to my friend about my gender identity issues they pointed out that they could see how a woman would feel FTM when so many things that are considered male are really just human traits. 

I feel it should be noted that I have OCD. Pure Obsessional. Intrusive thoughts basically. I get caught in mental loops of checking and questioning. I've suffered from mostly sexual themes. bestiality, incest, pedophilia, and sexuality, and then seemingly gender identity. (I'm not equating these things i'm just saying they all fall under the same ""theme"")
But I've been actually considering my gender identity as a part of me that could be up for question. do to that ""high thought"" and the fact that I've never fit into any sort of gender stereotype nor did I really ever get along with the ""stereotypical girls"" or fit in, in that space. 
As a child I remember being really excited about my period. I knew it was something that was going to happen and sort of couldn't wait for it to start. I never had issues with my body other than just feeling all around awkward. I feel like i've always just thought of my body as being.
In my teens I really just wanted things I was told I should have to fit into this stereotype of what it means to be female (big boobs, long legs, plump lips). But I always have sort of seen my self as looking very boyish and was deeply upset by this due to the fact that it was 'wrong'. hard to say how I'd feel about it if we lived in a different world. Anyway. I sort of have always thought that I look like a man despite being told that I have a feminine face. similar to what a lot of FTM's feel. (really only like 3 times ever, I don't see why anyone would openly say that i look like a boy unless they were trying to hurt my feelings) . 

Onto my point. I had stopped smoking weed for quite a few months due to it playing on my extreme anxiety. and just the other day smoked for the first time, because I considered myself at ease with my FTM identity even though i'm not out. Because it had been so long I got reeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaallllllllly high. similar to a feeling of tripping on LSD. Anyway I was thinking all these things about society and humans and general and how we are meant to be on the most basic level. we're really strange creatures if you think about it.
 Anyway I came to this point of just feeling totally neutrois. Like yes I have these body parts and they serve functions because that's that just nature. I don't feel like a girl or a boy because what does that even mean? I feel like a human and I like the things that I like. 
Anyway there have been a couple points where I just think about being transgender and I'm like wtf am i even talking about?!?
People have body dymorphia/dysphoria for all sorts of things. Why is gender so different? don't like your boobs? maybe you're just a human who doesn't want boobs but they're there. 
I no longer strive to look ""pretty"" and I don't necessarily want to be handsome I just want to look good in a way that I think good looks. I dont like my name never have. I feel people should be able to be called by whatever name they feel suits them. When I was younger I cried and begged for my name to be something along the lines of Moonbeam or after my favorite cartoon character. I'm considering now going by an androgynous nick name that i feel suits me. 

It just makes me wonder... If any of this is real. like if being trans is real. Is being trans just a fixation that can make you dysphoric? I mean i never experienced a ""phantom limb"" until i read about it. 

I realize people absolutely have a right to do whatever they want with their body. people get plastic surgery, tattoos, piercings, abortions.. I don't have a problem with any of it. just for me it just seems like trans people go to such great extremes. 

just because your AFAB and would like a more muscular looking body or facial hair. does that make you a man?

Iv'e read theories.. that i can agree with as much as i can agree with transitioning that basically state that gender identity issues can have alternative causes and alternative treatments...and i dont mean alternative treatment as in electroshock therapy or anything i just mean there are sometimes underlying causes. I do think it's sort of one sided in the fact that transition is presented as the only treatment.

I know this might get a lot of backlash but hey. it's just  my thoughts.

*edit* TLDR sorta feel like is everyone just neutrois but simply just trying to appear how they feel looks best

I mean i never experienced a ""phantom limb"" until i read about it. \n\nI realize people absolutely have a right to do whatever they want with their body. people get plastic surgery, tattoos, piercings, abortions.. I don\'t have a problem with any of it. just for me it just seems like trans people go to such great extremes. \n\njust because your AFAB and would like a more muscular looking body or facial hair. does that make you a man?\n\nIv\'e read theories.. that i can agree with as much as i can agree with transitioning that basically state that gender identity issues can have alternative causes and alternative treatments...and i dont mean alternative treatment as in electroshock therapy or anything i just mean there are sometimes underlying causes. I do think it\'s sort of one sided in the fact that transition is presented as the only treatment.\n\nI know this might get a lot of backlash but hey. it\'s just  my thoughts.\n\n*edit* TLDR sorta feel like is everyone just neutrois but simply just trying to appear how they feel looks best\n', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Controversial//Feeling Strange/// thoughts on Neutrois.', 'created': 1493023752.0}"

I essentially live a double life, and to be honest, sometimes it's fun. At work I'm typically full femme and at home/on weekends I show off my undershave and dress like a metal dude.

My day is no longer 9-5; when I'm with clients I have to keep the ""act"" up well into the evening too. 

I don't hate my feminine side when I get to choose it. For the last six months I've actually been presenting as femme more often. But inevitably, the urges for dudeliness come back. 

I was recently on a business trip when the *urge* hit, and I couldn't fulfill it. I actually found some dress clothes that are more andro, but struggled to put the right outfit together (more shopping, sigh), so I had to just suck it up and put on heels again. And since then I've been falling into some serious self-loathing and drive toward my masculine side. I've been back in my own city and have actually chosen to work from home a few days over the last week because I'm kind of depressed, and because the idea of dressing up again is just so awful. 

And all of this has me struggling with my presentation in general. I really don't like acknowledging/managing people's reactions to my appearance. But beyond appearance, I'm also wondering if maybe it's time to ""rebrand"" myself on social media, with a new name, etc. But I have family, etc. there and I don't really want to start a discussion. But I want to be as open as some of my friends are. I want to talk about my queer/poly/420-friendly/neuro-atypical life, you know? So do I juggle two social media accounts? ""Come out"" despite my discomfort? I like the idea of starting new, but I'm worried it's just a way for me to avoid admitting things to people.

But beyond appearance, I\'m also wondering if maybe it\'s time to ""rebrand"" myself on social media, with a new name, etc. But I have family, etc. there and I don\'t really want to start a discussion. But I want to be as open as some of my friends are. I want to talk about my queer/poly/420-friendly/neuro-atypical life, you know? So do I juggle two social media accounts? ""Come out"" despite my discomfort? I like the idea of starting new, but I\'m worried it\'s just a way for me to avoid admitting things to people. But I guess I don\'t owe anyone insight into my personal life/struggles. \n\nHelp? \n\n', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Struggling lately; could use some internet hugs/advice', 'created': 1493262100.0}"

i'm wrapping up my sophomore year of college; i transferred in january to a new university and am getting super anxious about asking people to call me scout and use they/them pronouns. i go to an arts school half full of queers so it really shouldn't matter but i keep psyching myself out about being out, even though i really want to be. i worry about the backlash, people talking about how i'm a try-hard/attention-seeker behind my back, the kinds of attention i'll no longer receive, etc etc etc.

i just know asking people to call me scout is going to draw a lot of unwanted attention, which really freaks me out, since i just got to this school and i'm trying to make friends. but i also feel like i should do it asap so it'll be easier for them to switch from my old name.

2017-04-28 04:15:21,680vuu,3,3,"Howdy ya'll!

So I'm new to the forum, but I'm happy to be here. Been lurking a few posts, enjoying the supportive words vicariously.

My main reason for writing is because I feel anxiety reaching out and befriending other nonbinary/genderqueer/genderfluid/etc. humans. I only came to the realization that I was genderqueer last year over the summer, and I've only been brave enough to start voicing my Truth and rocking a more androg aesthetic recently.

Perhaps the main source of my anxiety (aside from the anxiety disorder--that's mayhaps a wee bit of a contributing factor) is dealing with doubts about my own authenticity, which stems from two sources. One, I realized my own genderqueerness four years into a relationship with a cishet man (I'm AFAB); I've already dealt with feelings of erasure for years due to my bi/pansexuality being rendered pretty much invisible under the weight of people assuming our (my) heterosexuality and cisgenderedness.

The other source of my self-doubt my unabashed care for my body. I spent five years overcoming an eating disorder as a teenager because of the beauty standards the Western World applies on AFAB people. After five years of puking and sucking my stomach into my ribcage in the mirror, I'd had enough. It was either learn to love my body just as it is or wind up with permanent psychological wounds. So, I don't want to change my body. I don't even really think I'd go for a binder, as I hate all things confining and tight on my already-bony ribcage (I haven't worn a bra in ~5 years).

I don't doubt my Self, or my identity. I'm pretty strong in those respects. What burdens me is my fear of reaching out to other people like me. I have a few nonbinary friendquaintances in real life (too close to be an acquaintance, not quite friend enough for regular deep, philosophical convos), but I'm afraid of taking it to the next level.

What I really crave are those deep in-person conversations where we are vulnerable with each other and talk about our lives, our experiences, and our hopes. But, yeah, that's something you gotta work up to. If someone tried to have one of those convos with me on the subway? I'd likely wig out and leave--but then again, drifting off topic.

Anyways, like the title suggests, I'm unsure how to feel. I don't know if I should be male or female, which I suppose is why I chose here to ask about it. Now, the reason I feel this way is because in my appearance, and from what I've been told (and somewhat noticed) in my personality/behavior as well as even my voice.

I already look rather ""feminine"" with a more slender waist, wider hips, and over all ""softer"" features. With my personality, I've been told that my personality and behavior is what is usually considered to be typically more feminine. (Not saying I fully agree with the behavior stereotypes of genders, but a lot of how people say I behave, I do notice in myself.) Now, touching on my voice, it might be a bit weird how something like that could be an issue. But after listening to my own voice, it's a bit weird to explain. While yes it generally deeper, and men's voices do tend to be deeper, it doesn't sound ""masculine."" it also seems to shift pitch much more like a woman's.

Anyways, like I mentioned earlier the reason I'm using an alt-account. Much of my family I'm positive would not be pleased with noticing a post like this from my main account. I've not talked about this with my mother, as I have overheard rather... interesting ""jokes"" about people she's heard about with experiences like this.

This also gives me virtually no-one to talk to, as this is all of my family that I'm really ""close"" to. It's a similar situation with my friends. Only one of them do I believe would be accepting of this, but even then he's terrible at keeping secrets.
