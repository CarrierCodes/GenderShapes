I'm here from [Winning Writers’](https://winningwriters.com/), a resource website for writers. Part of our mission is to find and promote voices and themes underrepresented in publishing, including (but of course not limited to) racial, cultural, national, religious, gender/sexual identity, body positive, neurodiverse, and [dis]abled. We are interested primarily in the representation of the voices/themes in the poetry, rather than the identity of the writer. 

Right now we're running a writing contest with diversity at its heart. [The North Street Book Prize](https://winningwriters.com/our-contests/north-street-book-prize) for self-published books offers a grand prize of $3,000, six second prizes of $1,000 each, and six honorable mentions of $250 each, as well as marketing consultation and other prizes for grand- and second-prize winners. Categories include mainstream/literary fiction, genre fiction, creative nonfiction and memoir, poetry, children’s picture books, and graphic narrative. Excerpts and critiques of all winning entries will be published at winningwriters.com. The contest is international and the deadline is June 30. A reading fee of $60 funds our judging process. The North Street Book Prize is listed on [Poets &amp; Writers](https://www.pw.org/writing_contests/north_street_book_prize)’s “Grants &amp; Awards” page as a reputable contest.

I started doing outreach on Reddit last year, and since then we've received hundreds more entries featuring diverse characters and voices.

Hello! My name is Clover. I'm bi-gender, assigned male at birth. So, I guess I'm also Bryan.

I like my male body, and feel blessed. But for years I've suppressed another part of me out of fear and shame. This other part of me is distinct and has a very gentle, soothing, feminine energy. Without knowing it, this other part of me would break through and express herself in different ways. I've always pretended to be a girl online when playing MMORPGs, or in general just typing to people. It got so extreme that I've been in committed relationships with men who genuinely fell in love with this other part of me, thinking that I'm a woman irl. It also got to the point that whenever my hands would even touch a keyboard or a phone, I'd take on this other more feminine side.

I finally reached a point where I couldn't take it anymore. I realized I had been lying to myself and that I'm just not who I thought I was. I admitted to myself there's a woman inside of me, and came out to my therapist. Since then I've come up with a female name(Clover), changed my gender identity, and have slowly tried nurturing this other side of myself. I'm also an artist and have done some artwork of Clover, I'll post some of it below.

A point that this brings up. How do you all Identify yourselves? The reason I feel I'm bi-gender is because there are two distinct personas that I switch between to express two distinct sides of myself. When you talk about your other ""persona"" do you refer to them in the third person(as if they were another person) or do you simply refer to them with ""me, myself"" pronouns? I'm trying very hard to NOT sound crazy to people. But this is such a strange and confusing gender identity, that I worry all the time I've lost it and am finally going crazy.  
Anyways, thanks so much for listening. Any help. love, allies, words of support or anything at all would help. I feel so scared and vulnerable right now. More than I ever have. I could really use friends.

2019-06-02 23:58:39,bw42yg,3,3,"So I think the best label for me is likely ""genderfluid"" because of the different experiences I've been having.

But I'm not sure, the more I think about gender and the more I learn means I just end up feeling more confused than anything.  I look in the mirror at this AMAB, very masculine body of mine and wonder what I'd look like as a woman.  And then I realize I don't hate the male body that I have.  Its fine, its attractive, its got a lot of good qualities.  I like having a dick too.  And so then I stop wondering what I'd look like as a woman.  

Then I wonder what I'd feel like as a woman.  What would it feel like to be a woman who is with other women?  What would it feel like to be a woman with a woman?  And then I flip back in my head and I'm like, ""I'm a man and I wanna have sex with her as a man"".  I wanna use my dick to fuck her and I want her to suck it.  

And I'm just like, so weirdly conflicted between wanting to be sometimes man and sometimes woman.  I like being a man in my day-to-day life.  I have rarely, if ever, wondered what it would be like to be a woman out in the streets.  I like being seen as a man, I take photos with my cousins and dress up in masculine ways.  Sometimes I dress more gender-neutral, but I scoff at the idea of wearing a dress or makeup.  

I don't like the idea of medically transitioning and growing breasts.  I don't like the idea of losing my ""masc"" so to speak.  I like it and I want to keep it.  I don't like female pronouns (had some friends try them for a while on me and I often have this disconnect when they refer to me as ""she"" like its not about me).  So here I've been just sort of idling by as a regular old man for the past half year or so since I've come to terms with ""nonbinary"" as a label for myself.  And the only thing I can say is that I don't know what I want.  Even still, I don't know what I want.

I can't relate to many transwomen's stories, but I relate a lot to Ash Hardell.  I relate a lot to Jeffree Marsh. 
Sometimes when I imagine myself as having been born a ciswoman, I end up thinking I'd like to be transmasculine.  And I have no idea why I can come to that conclusion about myself.  My dysphoria isn't killing me inside like it did once I first took the label ""trans"" onto myself.  It's just sorta like I'm ""aware"" of it without suffering from anything.  

Its hard to tell exactly what I am or who I want to be anymore.  When I picture myself, ""What would I like to look like in 10 years.""  I picture a man with long hair, feminine glasses, a beard, and smiling at a friend.  I don't picture myself as ""woman"".  Not really.  Its as though being either gender as we know and expect them to be is becoming less of a possibility for me.  And its a weird feeling because I've lived for so long as ""man"" that I just sort of default to it, while also sometimes waking up and feeling ""woman"".

Straight to the point, do these feelings sound like dysphoria? The more I read about what dysphoria feels like, the more I feel like maybe I've had some experience with it. It's strange, because I wouldn't consider myself trans. I have some issues with how women are expected to look, dress, and act, but I don't feel discomfort in my actual body.

&amp;#x200B;

I've never liked dressing traditionally feminine--wearing a dress and heels with a nice sweater, or even a pantsuit with a feminine cut. Formal occasions weren't great for me, especially as I got older and realized I could wear suits (but didn't because of my parents), and by the time I was 16 or so, really couldn't stand wearing dresses, or even some of the also feminine alternatives offered to me (jumpsuits, for example). Part of that was because I felt bad about not standing up for myself, but the other part was that I felt gross. Like, I felt like I was too big and too masculine to be wearing a dress--same with whatever basic black flats I had on at the time. I don't shave my legs, but I also hated the sight of my hairy legs coming out the bottom of the dress...it just wasn't right. I didn't really like having my picture taken because it would always be the worst version of myself staring back at me. 

&amp;#x200B;

It also happened with my hair; It took me a long time to get the courage to cut my hair when I was younger. Until I buzzed it all off, I couldn't stand to touch it very much. I pulled it back and wore hats as often as I could get away with it (my mom always insisted I not wear a hat too often because it would make my hair fall out). Another reason I hated formal occasions was because I would be expected to make my hair look nice, which of course meant ""feminine"". People would fawn over how long and pretty it was. The more people paid attention to it, the more I wanted to pull it back and put on a hat. One of the hardest things was resisting the urge to just cut it off whenever I was home alone--I waited until I graduated, at my mother's request.

&amp;#x200B;

This might sound really weird, and this is theoretical, I'm putting feelers out there for info so maybe this is stupid question... but I recently learned that trans guys actually experience changes down there and the clit grows into what looks like a penis. What interested me more was that these changes are among the first to happen. I'm wondering if I could take T for a week or two, get the bottom growth I seek before anything like hair/voice set in, and get off T while still enjoying some sort of benefit to my new bottom growth after my hormones return to their normal levels. Would I get enough growth in the first couple weeks for it to look obvious from a distance? would it still get erect?

  
And no, this isn't some clit-enlargement fetish, I don't want to pump.

&amp;#x200B;

""Why do you want to go on T then go off it?""

I've been struggling with my gender identity, I'm already kind of androgynous in terms of expression (I'm a bit femme in terms of body-type), I look like a tomboy. Sometimes I feel like a sexy sexy girl, and sometimes I feel like a handsome cute boy who wears sweaters and glasses, like a more delicate Jon Watson. I glimpsed myself in the mirror once when my shirt was off, and the way my neck was turned seemed very masculine and I was like ""wow... I'm kinda hot"". And it's moments like that when I consider trying out transitioning.

I don't think I need hormone therapy or anything cause I'm still questioning and this is all very theoretical still (I haven't even decided to get a therapist yet)... I think I'm more nonbinary or genderfluid, if I'm even that... sometimes I think I'm just a boyish cis girl. 

I've held a dildo to myself and while it felt good, like scary good, I don't like the idea of things hanging down there, it's why I don't have a lot of bottom dysphoria, I got the ""compact"" package, and right now I'm eyeing that clit as a win-win. I get a dick, but it's not huge and expensive, and I don't have to jump into the other changes from T until I decide I'm ready. 

&amp;#x200B;

My problem with T is the changes that come with it, the hair growth, the hair loss, the voice, I don't want that, at least I don't think I do. Ideally I'd be one of those boys who can't grow a beard or body hair and whose voice barely cracks. I feel like the changes I want are too small for testosterone aside from the bottom growth.

one. (pronouns, and maybe my name?)... I don't feel it right away, it slowly builds and builds till I can't keep it in anymore. I just start crying the next time I feel safe, and if I'm in public I'm really really quiet. I will only answer yes or no questions. 

two. (appearance)... this one I feel right away. I'm a morning person, so I wake-up happy, making it so there is a time frame that I need to put on make-up, otherwise I just turn into a sad sack and won't have the will power to put any on later, or do anything practical.

three. (sex organs)... I feel a detachment from them like they are not mine, and never have been, it's the same feeling that I think any person would get if there was a tile pattern but it was messed up by one tile. Just ""that's not suppose to be there, it needs to be fixed, now"". it also gives me restrictions in clothing. in my mind at least, body parts should not move unless directly told to by me, the circumstances don't matter, they just shouldn't.

2019-06-09 14:11:18,bykl08,4,10,"Hello my fellow fabulous humans! Firstly, thanks to everyone who has engaged in my prior posts (which were quite depressing at times) - it is because of your positive reinforcement I am now more than comfortable being and presenting the genderqueer identidty I feel! As they say where I live Wales, Diolch yn fawr Iawn Pawb!

Anyway, onto the crux of this post. It occurs to me that a lot of the 'trouble' and confusion I had around my Gender identity was that there honestly isnt much information on anything past the LGBT of the the LGBTQ+ community. When I was growing up and could feel that I didnt belong being labled a 'boy' but at the same time I also didnt feel like being a 'girl' I was just left confused - was it a phase? Was it normal? Was my lack of wanting to feel masculine part of being not straight? And would I even be allowed to present feminine when I also fancied girls? That confusion and isolation created a lot of confusion and self hatred for me - as I know it has for many others.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel a lot of that could have been curbed by there being a lot more freely available information on people who identify as Genderqueer. Equally for cis people who have never heard of Genderqueer the more open and public the information is the less likely we are to be met with confusion or derision. As such I feel a Genderqueer Awerness Day might be a good thing.

&amp;#x200B;

There is of course the Non-Binary People's Day every year on July 14th but I myself would consider myself non-binary as a secondary thing, to be honest I only really use it when Im explaining what Genderqueer is (if that makes sense?). I would rather see another day, alongside Non-Binary People's Day, that specifically focuses on people who Identify as Genderquuer so this specific self identification can be celebrated and have its awerness spread.

I met a gay guy last year, and we’ve become really good friends. When I first saw him I was really taken, but I realised he was gay, and I’m usually good at just turning off that kind of thing when I realise someone’s unavailable, so I turned it off. “I can appreciate women who are pretty,” he said. “Like I think you’re really cute.” He calls me cute when we’re high, sometimes. Probably just the drugs talking. I like to hear it either way.

Much later on, I came out to him as non binary - more, he figured it out. God, he took it well; made a real effort to be cool about it, once he got through his apologies.

I’m starting to realise I didn’t really manage to turn off my crush on him, and last week we shared a bed after getting home drunk from a night clubbing, and in the morning as he slept I watched the rising and falling slope of his shoulders down to his waist and thought, “This is so unfair.”

I had to take my binder off as we slept, and in the morning when I put it back on I thought, “I don’t want to do this - I don’t want to bind - I don’t want to bind just to walk to do the few minute walk to my apartment, but I don’t want anyone to see my chest.”

I’m starting to wonder if I should begin a medical transition. When I was a teenager, that seemed urgent, then it took a back seat, for reasons I don’t really remember. Time, fear, or the fucking effort of it, maybe. But I don’t know what I want. I don’t know what I want separated from other people. I don’t want to come out to the guys at work, on my Facebook, my digital footprint wiped over unsuccessfully like rocks on the beach as the tide comes in. I don’t want that awkward first stage of transition. Dating would be even more of a nightmare than it already is.

But I don’t want this personhood, either.

When I was a teenager, that seemed urgent, then it took a back seat, for reasons I don’t really remember. Time, fear, or the fucking effort of it, maybe. But I don’t know what I want. I don’t know what I want separated from other people. I don’t want to come out to the guys at work, on my Facebook, my digital footprint wiped over unsuccessfully like rocks on the beach as the tide comes in. I don’t want that awkward first stage of transition. Dating would be even more of a nightmare than it already is.\n\nBut I don’t want this personhood, either.\n\nI’ll probably delete this post in the morning.

so I've always been a tomboy kinda girl, I remember throwing tantrums because I was forced to wear a dress or a skirt, this started around the age of 10. I remember crying the day of my middle school graduation because I had to wear a dress and ballet flats. I've hated nail polish and makeup (excluding a strange eye shadow phase) I also gravitated to more genderless things as a child. I never really went through a princess phase or anything. 

family members have tried to get me to be more girly but it's never worked and just made me more uncomfortable. 
I've always felt more comfortable in leggings and loose shirts and so thats all I wear. 
I've also never been a huge fan of my chest, like I understand that I have boobs (they are small) but have never really cared for them. recently I started wearing singlets and loose tshirts, I look flat chested. I feel more me when I do that. I've also taken a liking to the name alex as I love how it's not gendered. my name is pretty gendered (will not tell you what it is as its pretty uncommon)
I also have times where I think about having a penis but then the feeling completely fades. 

I like she/her pronouns or they/them pronouns, but hate he/him pronouns. 

most of the time I do not feel like a boy but I also do not feel like a girl.

Every single moment, from the drive to the store to the fifteen minutes I spent sitting in my car hyping myself up to the dressing rooms to the ride home, hated all of it right on down to looking at myself in the mirror and wondering why I didn't 'match up' with what I saw in my head.

I chalked it up to 'it will pass' for so much longer than I should have.

My first thought was - ""Oh no, here we go again.""

I said I wanted to talk to her in person about it later, and text was a terrible way to have The Talk.


Today we talked and she wants to pass more androgynously so we went on Amazon and found a couple binders and she's going to talk to her hair stylist (also queer) about what she can do there. It was just helluva weird to be on the *other* side of The Talk^TM for once. I mean, sure, I've got queer friends, I've had people come out to me, even tell me I inspired them to do it.

I want to explore and experiment with what feels right (specifically dressing/behaving as a female, but not in public) but I want my wife to be on board with me. She is bisexual and a very accepting person so I'm not really afraid of her not accepting it. \n\nI guess my concern is that I won't express myself well especially since I don't fully know what it means for me yet either. Also I want her to know that I am still fully attracted and devoted to her, regardless of what I'm founding out about myself. \n\nDoes anyone have advice or tips for this situation?\n\nThanks in advance! \n\nP.s. Any insight on why I might be feeling shame and how to work through it wouldn't go amiss.

*{I only recently learned about and realized that I am this gender, so I want more information on it and if there's any specific rules or normal things to do with it comes to being Demigirl.

*Can I have very feminine / girly interests and sense of fashion but still be both male and female?*

*Can I wear girly / pastel clothes and paint my nails even on days where I feel more like a male, or do you think that's not how it works?*
