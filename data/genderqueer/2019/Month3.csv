Then I moved to a new place and despite trying to explain what I wanted my first haircut was so aggressively masc that I couldn't look in the mirror for a couple of weeks without triggering dysphoria. 

I'm also on the autism spectrum, and the social navigation involved in getting a femme haircut as an AMAB from a standard salon has me a bit stumped.

Wondering if anyone has experience around this and would be able to offer advice. I'm in the UK if that's relevent.

* I know I want a hair salon, not a barbers - would a ""ladies"" salon mind cutting my hair, or should I look for an explicitly unisex one?

* Should I expect to pay the women's price or the men's price? I want to pay the women's price, because I want exactly the service that they would give to a woman, but would it be weird if I suggest that?

* Am I more likely to get the haircut I want if I temporarily shave off my beard?

* I was thinking of asking ""imagine I was a woman growing out her hair from a pixie cut, what styles would you recommend?"" Does that sound like a good approach?

* I live in a small town - would I be better off traveling to the nearest big city for this?

I realized that the only way to truly be ME is to be like I was all through my teenage years, until I met my boyfriend - androgynous/leaning towards the masculine side. I used to bind, wore exclusively men's clothes and had very short hair. I actually thought that I was trans at one point but I don't think so anymore, at least not 100%. My boyfriend knows I was boyish back then but he doesn't know any details.

I have chest dysphoria and hips/butt/thighs dysphoria, some days are worse than others. I use tight sports bras and they help but not enough. I wear androgynous/boyish clothes and I have short hair. I've stopped shaving and I only wear enough makeup to hide my dark circles. I'm so much more comfortable now, but I know my boyfriend doesn't like it, even though he says he still loves me. He keeps going on and on about my beautiful long hair and all the dresses I used to wear. He said that he feels like I cheated him, because I've changed so much and that I'm going through a crisis or something and that he doesn't get why people have to change, he's been the same all his life.

I feel miserable, I feel like I'm doing wrong to my boyfriend and I'm afraid it's going to make him fall out of love with me and leave, I love him and our family more than anything. But  at the same time I feel like this change is something I NEED to do, I feel so much better about myself already even though I haven't had the courage to go full androgynous/masculine yet. I'm kind of holding on to the last feminine parts of me for him... But I don't think I can do it forever.

How can I feel better in this situation? Or is it even right for me to feel better, what if this ends up breaking our family? All because of me suddenly turning into a guy (like my boyfriend put it)?

When I was little I always wanted to play the female character in games and sometimes act out the female character in role play in real life. Despite this I also role played as male characters in real life and was happy with that. I used to want to shave like my dad and I also used to want to put a towel on my head like my my Mum (like a woman) I knew I was a boy and I never questioned it, yet sometimes I would daydream about what it would be like to be a girl. Yet still, I never thought I was a girl if that makes sense. I played with the girls at school but also played with guys. 
I remember my sister and her friends dressing me up as a girl and I felt all pretty but didn‚Äôt feel that much different? I also never felt wrong in boy clothes. I remember being at a birthday party full of girls and I was the only little boy there, and I remember just thinking it was normal for a little boy to play with little girls, and after the party we got goody bags and I got a boy one and they got girl ones but I wasn‚Äôt jealous I was just like oh cool whatever? 
It was like I was genderless. 
So fast forward to puberty when I realize I‚Äôm gay and begin to hide it, I feel an immense change in me lots of anxiety etc, but no issues with my body or puberty at all - to this day I‚Äôm very comfortable with my body and facial hair etc. 
When I picture myself in the future I picture myself as a man, yet my mind keeps saying but what if you‚Äôre a woman. 
I‚Äôve also gone to a gender therapist and she has hinted that I have OCD because of things I did in the past, we‚Äôve also agreed I call myself just a person. 
I‚Äôve tried on eye makeup and it didn‚Äôt do anything to me and when I made myself a skirt to try on I just felt like a man in a skirt. 
I had a dream a few months ago were my friend was like ‚Äòoh you‚Äôre a woman, and a man‚Äô I also had a dream where I had long hair and I remember not liking it in the dream.
I literally feel like I don‚Äôt fit in anywhere.

I'm just discovering that I'm somewhere in the genderqueer world--trans and enby feel like validating terms, and so I'm trying to own them and own my identity. For 38 years...I didn't do that. Finally, this year, I came out to myself.

Initially, I thought my wife of four years was understanding, but it seems she doesn't quite ""get"" what all of this means. She's afraid she's not going to like ""what I become."" At first, she would say things like, ""men in the 16th century used to wear frilly clothes and high heels..."" I think it was a rationalization to her that I was still essentially masculine, that I just liked to wear cute things. She'd be like, ""that's cool, I like to wear cute things too."" I felt like I just couldn't get through to her. I would have to correct her that I don't want to dress like a man from *any* era. I really want to express my feminine traits in some way.

I tried explaining it more to her. She's read things on enbies--good info, too. But she just doesn't *get it.* And I said, ""I don't get it either a lot of the time."" She doesn't understand how confused I feel about this stuff, how I waver between denial and acceptance.

When I told my therapist yesterday, she was so supportive and happy for me. She knew how much shit I've dealt with my whole life, and encouraged me to try to ""lean in"" to my enby-ness. I have, and while it's been a lot of ups and downs, I know that this is something I'm going to explore until I really understand who I am.

And that's the problem: I'm kind of sad to say it, but I just don't think this is gonna be able to happen in this relationship. I understand that she's confused and worried that she won't like ""what I turn into,"" but that can't determine whether or not I go through this transition (and it *is* a transition of sorts). I need a space to explore myself, and I know that I'm not going to be able to do that with someone who tries to one-up me and make it a competition about who is going through more shit right now.

It's been extremely difficult to write them, especially since I originally came up with them as one particular gender. This makes me subliminally ""auto-correct"" their pronoun inside my head, which leads me to believe I'm not writing them as non-binary at all.  


This isn't the biggest problem, though. I can adjust my slip-ups, but I worry that I don't know enough about non-binary people to write a non-binary character.  


Therefore, your mission is to:  
a) give me any constructive advice directly concerning writing a non-binary character that comes to mind  
b) tell me some quirks a non-binary character might have  
c) educate me more on non-binary people   
d) think of some cool names \[so I can steal them for other (potentially nb) characters!\]

  
My greatest concern is that the reader knows they are non-binary, without me explicitly stating it. If you're a fellow wordsmith, perhaps you could offer up advice on how to push the reader's perception towards them being non-binary rather than one particular gender.

here is me: http://imgur.com/dTLy79I

as you can see, my face is very round, fat, and feminine. i am 6ft tall. i feel like any haircut i get will make me look like a butch lesbian. (i do like girls, but i'd really really really rather look androgynous-masculine-ish than lesbianish.)

i've got a few i think might work, but this is my first time. it will be done without telling my family in advance, so i can't ask for their help. (when i was 15, i tried for short hair, but again, my mom said i'd look like a butch lesbian. not what i wanted then, either.)

I‚Äôm AFAB, and I have a few fitness goals vis a vis gender presentation - but mostly I‚Äôm curious what other people are doing fitness-wise to claim ownership of their nice genderqueer bodies. 

My goals:
- femme+strong ass and strong legs. Via strength training
- low bf and no breasts lol - I know you can‚Äôt spot reduce but I can dream
- posture and carriage of elite level male athletes - Usain Bolt for example.  I want that easy, relaxed straight-spine posture, arm-swinging confidence.  Also I feel like my breastbone is sunken and I‚Äôd like to work on thrusting it upwards.  I think I slouch in order to hide my breasts :/

What I‚Äôm doing:
-training for a half-marathon - focusing a lot on form and hoping it‚Äôll help with posture 
- sprints and high intensity training to boost T
- basic strength training (squats, single legged deadlifts, lunges and power cleans mostly) for that lower body - focusing on form and visualizing myself as Bolt üòÖ to help with subtle posture cues 
-pull up bar - mostly for my ego
-some upper body strength for balance and posture 

-looooots of core

Long story short he wants the Dad whomis trying to support his bullied son, to be seen as weak.

&gt;Why would these people feel the need to convince their son to not conform to the expectations of his kindergarten group, and forever be ‚Äúthe boy who wears nail polish‚Äù?

&gt;Why would his parents want to change his mind on this?

Because this is normal for kids? So why should they be forced to change?

2019-03-30 03:59:10,b76tsh,5,11,"Hey all! I've never posted here before, but I've got a kind of funny (and for me, brutally embarrassing) story about trying to schedule a haircut at a salon. Actually, I'm still reeling from the embarrassment, so I figured I'd post here to 1) entertain y'all and 2) vent.

The area I live in is pretty conservative and isn't very pro-LGBTQ--I don't think anyone here would hate you if you were gay, but they're definitely less understanding of less well-known identities (like being genderqueer). However, there's a college town about 40 minutes from where I live that's pretty progressive, so I looked up a list of LGBTQ-friendly salons in that area and decided to try booking a haircut.

Background info about me: after over a year of gender confusion and questioning, I'm pretty comfortable identifying as non-binary/genderqueer/transmasculine. Because I'm not firmly FTM, though--or at least, I don't think I am--I've got a good deal of impostor syndrome, especially when it comes to telling people how I identify. (I'm sure y'all know how it is. *Genderqueer* is harder to explain to most people than just *trans guy or gal,* and sometimes the idea of having to explain myself makes me doubt my identity a little.)

Anyway, partly thanks to my current hairstyle, no one really sees me as a transmaculine/genderqueer dude. (Obviously, I'm trying to change that with a new haircut.) I should also add that, because of the whole transmasculine thing, I'm aiming to be read as male and not female. In fact, it's gotten to the point where I wonder if maybe I'm just a guy, period--but that's another story, so I won't go into that here. Point being, I'm genderqueer and looking to present as male/masculine.

So, I found this LGBTQ-friendly salon, *and* I found out that they have online booking--which is a double score, because I hate talking to people on the phone. When I was booking an appointment, though, the site asked me to sign up for either a women's haircut or a men's haircut. I knew that effort-wise my hair qualified as a women's haircut, but in terms of style, I wanted to make sure I got a guy's haircut. Also, I know that for trans people, getting haircuts can be a harrowing (hairowing?) experience, and I wanted to avoid any distress caused by someone trying to give me an androgynous women's cut or something.

Of course, I realized I could just suck it up: sign up for the women's cut, and when I get there, insist with all my might that I'm transmasculine, hoping that they haven't already decided my gender before I even walk through the door. But then I thought, hey! Why don't I email them first and ask?

Yeah, great idea.

(No, really, this was actually a great idea. Just...not-so-great execution.)

Again, my area--really, my state in general--is more conservative, so I was wary of saying that I was genderqueer. I didn't know if they'd understand what that meant, or if they'd associate it with something negative and write me off. And honestly, I'm still having trouble asserting my gender identity; rather than speak up and gently correct someone when they misgender me, I tend to just get pissed and say nothing. But for this haircut, this first step toward really presenting properly, I wanted to own my truth.

...own my truth in a way that did not *explicitly* say I was genderqueer, just in case that would hurt my chances of getting a haircut.

So I ended up writing something like, ""I'd like to get a men's haircut, but my legal gender is female, although I don't identify that way, etc., etc., how should I book the appointment?"" I read over the email, reworded it a few times, proofread it, and sent it to my sibling for a second set of eyes. Everything looked good. This was the perfect email! Satisfied, I sent it off, then spent the next six hours anxiously waiting for a response.

Around dinnertime, I got a very friendly email confirming that yes, because my hair would take longer to work with, I should technically sign up for a women's haircut. However, there was a spot where I could leave a note specifying that I identify as--as--

*Oh, no. What have I done?*

Ah, yes, friends. My first time owning my truth, but I...didn't quite own it. See, apparently the phrasing I used--where I said I wasn't female, but didn't specify what I actually *was*\--led them to believe that I was a trans guy. The last part of their email (about how I could attach a note to my appointment) was telling me to leave a note so that the salon knew I identify as male.

Now, maybe this isn't as simultaneously amusing/horrifying to y'all as it was to me, but oh, was my face red when I read that email. I never considered the possibility that they would automatically assume I was FTM--though in hindsight, what *else* would they assume? Like, man, I really walked into that one. 

So then, of course, I was tasked with the incredibly awkward process of emailing the salon again to try to explain that *no, I'm not technically male...well, yes, I'm definitely more male than female. Actually, have you heard of being genderqueer? Because if you have, then this is really awkward, because I could've just mentioned this to begin with. Uh, actually, I just think I'll try the next salon on the list.*

Okay, so I didn't write that, exactly. However, I did feel really embarrassed and stupid writing that clarification email. I mean, maybe they don't even care how I identify. Maybe that was TMI. And they were so nice and understanding that I hated to ""correct"" them, especially with something that makes a lot less sense than just *trans guy.* 

Then again, if I didn't email them back, I was worried there would be some confusion if the ""guy"" who just emailed them then turned around and booked an appointment as *gender: other.* So, I sucked it up and sent them the awkward email.

Of course, part of me is laughing at all of this, because this is exactly the sort of thing I would do. It wouldn't be the first time I've put my foot in my mouth and given someone the wrong idea about me. On the other hand, now my impostor syndrome is through the roof. I keep thinking that maybe I'm faking being under the trans umbrella, or that I'm wrong and confused, or that I don't deserve to assert myself as transmasculine or genderqueer, et cetera, et cetera.

That's all wrong, of course. I know I'm valid. Lurking on this sub (and texting my sibling 100 times in the past three hours) has taught me that much. Still, this was...not the start I wanted for my first men's haircut, lmao.

Anyway, I just wanted to share this story with y'all because I thought it was funny in a slightly horrible way. Of all the things I imagined going wrong when I tried to book a haircut, this didn't even cross my mind. But I mean, hey, at least I'll be getting my men's haircut. 

And let this be an inspirational message to you all that there *are* accommodating salons out there...even if you accidentally request the wrong kind of accommodations.

&amp;#x200B;",genderqueer,"Accidentally gave hair salon the wrong idea and now I'm embarrassed, RIP",1553943550.0,"{'created_utc': 1553918350, 'id': 'b76tsh', 'num_comments': 5, 'score': 11, 'selftext': 'Hey all! I\'ve never posted here before, but I\'ve got a kind of funny (and for me, brutally embarrassing) story about trying to schedule a haircut at a salon. Actually, I\'m still reeling from the embarrassment, so I figured I\'d post here to 1) entertain y\'all and 2) vent.\n\nThe area I live in is pretty conservative and isn\'t very pro-LGBTQ--I don\'t think anyone here would hate you if you were gay, but they\'re definitely less understanding of less well-known identities (like being genderqueer). However, there\'s a college town about 40 minutes from where I live that\'s pretty progressive, so I looked up a list of LGBTQ-friendly salons in that area and decided to try booking a haircut.\n\nBackground info about me: after over a year of gender confusion and questioning, I\'m pretty comfortable identifying as non-binary/genderqueer/transmasculine. Because I\'m not firmly FTM, though--or at least, I don\'t think I am--I\'ve got a good deal of impostor syndrome, especially when it comes to telling people how I identify. (I\'m sure y\'all know how it is. *Genderqueer* is harder to explain to most people than just *trans guy or gal,* and sometimes the idea of having to explain myself makes me doubt my identity a little.)\n\nAnyway, partly thanks to my current hairstyle, no one really sees me as a transmaculine/genderqueer dude. (Obviously, I\'m trying to change that with a new haircut.) I should also add that, because of the whole transmasculine thing, I\'m aiming to be read as male and not female. In fact, it\'s gotten to the point where I wonder if maybe I\'m just a guy, period--but that\'s another story, so I won\'t go into that here. Point being, I\'m genderqueer and looking to present as male/masculine.\n\nSo, I found this LGBTQ-friendly salon, *and* I found out that they have online booking--which is a double score, because I hate talking to people on the phone. When I was booking an appointment, though, the site asked me to sign up for either a women\'s haircut or a men\'s haircut. I knew that effort-wise my hair qualified as a women\'s haircut, but in terms of style, I wanted to make sure I got a guy\'s haircut. Also, I know that for trans people, getting haircuts can be a harrowing (hairowing?) experience, and I wanted to avoid any distress caused by someone trying to give me an androgynous women\'s cut or something.\n\nOf course, I realized I could just suck it up: sign up for the women\'s cut, and when I get there, insist with all my might that I\'m transmasculine, hoping that they haven\'t already decided my gender before I even walk through the door. But then I thought, hey! Why don\'t I email them first and ask?\n\nYeah, great idea.\n\n(No, really, this was actually a great idea. Just...not-so-great execution.)\n\nAgain, my area--really, my state in general--is more conservative, so I was wary of saying that I was genderqueer. I didn\'t know if they\'d understand what that meant, or if they\'d associate it with something negative and write me off. And honestly, I\'m still having trouble asserting my gender identity; rather than speak up and gently correct someone when they misgender me, I tend to just get pissed and say nothing. But for this haircut, this first step toward really presenting properly, I wanted to own my truth.\n\n...own my truth in a way that did not *explicitly* say I was genderqueer, just in case that would hurt my chances of getting a haircut.\n\nSo I ended up writing something like, ""I\'d like to get a men\'s haircut, but my legal gender is female, although I don\'t identify that way, etc., etc., how should I book the appointment?"" I read over the email, reworded it a few times, proofread it, and sent it to my sibling for a second set of eyes. Everything looked good. This was the perfect email! Satisfied, I sent it off, then spent the next six hours anxiously waiting for a response.\n\nAround dinnertime, I got a very friendly email confirming that yes, because my hair would take longer to work with, I should technically sign up for a women\'s haircut. However, there was a spot where I could leave a note specifying that I identify as--as--\n\n*Oh, no. What have I done?*\n\nAh, yes, friends. My first time owning my truth, but I...didn\'t quite own it. See, apparently the phrasing I used--where I said I wasn\'t female, but didn\'t specify what I actually *was*\\--led them to believe that I was a trans guy. The last part of their email (about how I could attach a note to my appointment) was telling me to leave a note so that the salon knew I identify as male.\n\nNow, maybe this isn\'t as simultaneously amusing/horrifying to y\'all as it was to me, but oh, was my face red when I read that email. I never considered the possibility that they would automatically assume I was FTM--though in hindsight, what *else* would they assume?
