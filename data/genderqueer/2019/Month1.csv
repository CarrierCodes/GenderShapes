I’m AMAB, and while I don’t have a particularly strong reaction to my given name, there’s a common girl’s name I’ve wanted since I was a kid. Though I’ve never told anyone, I’ve long thought of it internally as my name, and when I hear the name spoken, I can’t help but look up or think of it being my own name, and I can’t think of the name, or of someone who has the name, without associating it with myself.

I’m always read as male, and while that’s a little annoying, I’m generally okay with my appearance most of the time. As a result, it’s always been hard for me to imagine existing in the world and using the name I really want. I guess another thing is that I never disliked my birth name enough to figure changing my name was worth the trouble.

Nonetheless, as time goes on, I can’t help but think of the ""girl name"" as the name that best suits me.  I find myself repeating the name to myself hundreds of times each day, and I think of that as my name when I'm talking to myself. Now, I’m seriously thinking about starting to use this name publically, but it still feels hard to imagine actually doing it.  It feels like a bit of a foreign concept to me, being an obviously AMAB person with a deep voice using a very common female name that isn't gender neutral in any way. I’m not really sure what kind of reaction to expect, but at the very least I’m wary of what I’m sure will be a lot of explaining to do. Anyone have thoughts or advice on this?

2019-01-02 17:53:37,abvq5k,6,1,"    Hi,
    My (23-F) sibling (Q-20, formerly M-20) wants to go by xe/xim/xer pro-nouns. My sibling is living with my parents and our younger brother (14) while I have a separate apartment. Nobody is handling this well. I've just been ignoring it. Our brother is a really sweet kid who cares about everyone in the family, but basically doesn't believe gender fluidity is a thing or that gender-queer/nonbinary/trans people are real. He's also a big gamer/youtube fan and they make fun of nonbinary people on the channels he follows. Mom has also started making fun of nonbinary people, and Dad thinks that trans people who get surgery have been tricked by the big pharma into mutilating themselves and insists on calling my sibling 'he'. They all think xe's crazy, going through a phase, or is having an existential crisis and is just confused about everything. Some of our extended family members have reacted even worse (xe's been brainwashed by the global/liberal elites and should be in a mental institution :/). 
    
    I care about my sibling a lot want to be supportive but even I'm having trouble accepting xer identity, because my sibling also a habit of making dramatic life decisions and abandoning them as soon as they get difficult or boring. ""I'm gonna move to New York to be an artist"" was abandoned after two months, ""I'm gonna go to college full time"" was abandoned after one semester, ""I'm going to stay at this job for a couple years because they pay well, promote from within, and are willing to pay for me to go to college part time"" was abandoned after three months, ""I'm going to start my own business"" was abandoned almost immediately. So how do I know this is legit and not just a phase like all that other stuff? It matters because this is going to cause a lot of conflict in our family. I'm going to have to put myself out there and risk relationships with them which would suck if xe's just going to go back to being a dude in three months. 
    
    My sibling as a history of getting swept up in random crap without thinking it through. Xe fell for a online scam earlier this year trying to find an apartment and lost $1200. Xe's now trying to find a new place to live for free by writing notes in marker and leaving them in random people's mailboxes. My sibling believes the most ridiculous lies (like xe's ex-boyfriend telling xim that he killed a guy by running him over with a horse). Xe's gotten into ridiculous health fads, pseudo-science, conspiracy theories like anti-vaxxing and (((global elites))) all sorts if new age pseudo-spiritual nonsense. ""We'll manifest money with the power of positive thinking/trust the universe"" sort of thing. I'm not saying that being gender queer is a conspiracy theory or a scam just pointing out a pattern my sibling has a pattern of being flaky and out of touch with reality. 
    
    I've talked about it with my sibling after xe asked to use the gender neutral pro-nouns and xe said some things I've heard others express like feeling dysphoria, feeling wrong for being a ""broken pro-creator"", feeling disconnected from reality because xe feel disconnected from xes body. But those kernels of clarity were wrapped with a whole lot of 'sex is the union between the physical and the spiritual' and more new-agey mysticism. I'm having a lot of trouble taking xer seriously and can't imagine how we're going to convince my parents and relatives to take this seriously.
    
    Do you have any insight on what's going on in my sibling's head and suggestions for how I should treat xim? Or suggestions for how to discuss this with our family members? Is there a way to discuss my sibling's mistakes and personality flaws without making it about xer being gender-queer? Am I being to harsh? A lot of people fall for scams and most 20 year olds don't have their lives figured out. I can only imagine how much worse this would be if you also had gender dysphoria and everybody though you were crazy, even your family. I'm a very rational scientific person and my sibling is more artistic and emotional, could some of my judgment be due to differences in communication styles? My sibling definitely has problems with depression and I've noticed a lot of the symptoms lately (Losing weight, trouble making decisions, inappropriate affect). I don't want to make that worse.

I get that is part of being genderfluid but im unsure as to how to handle it. When im in full guy mode i get shy around my husband because im always afraid of his reaction. Though he has shown me nothing but love and acceptance. Plus my libido is much higher in full guy mode.

So I know that gender is socially constructed and gender is just how you feel and that expression and performance are separate things. But I feel like people tend to think about whether or not they align with their gender assigned at birth in terms of if they experience gender related body dysphoria and/or gender expression/performance that doesn’t “match”. And I know this is very important to people’s identities so I mean this question just out of my own lack of understanding of gender as a concept and of my own gender. But I feel like since you can be any gender and have any body parts and express yourself in anyway gender identity itself has no meaning to me? And like I don’t understand what it means to feel like a woman. I’m afab and I feel like my “woman” experiences are related to that I have certain body parts and experience the oppression/violence of walking through the world perceived as a woman and I feel that violence contributes to a strong part of my identity. But the person I was talking this through with said that I don’t understand the feeling of not feeling the right gender because I’ve never had to think about it as a presumably cis person and that I never had a problem with puberty and all that. But then I felt very upset and emotional unexpectedly because that’s not actually true. I was really upset at puberty when I started getting boobs. And I feel like over time I’ve kind of gotten used to them and done emotional work to try to accept/ignore my body. And I think that’s tied to multiple things like violence/body image around food but also to gender. I’m kind of interested in trying a binder just like to see how I would feel in it but I haven’t talked to anyone in my life about this and I feel nervous about talking to my partner about it who I live with I guess. 

I also started wearing button down shirts and wore a bow tie to a wedding a few months ago which weirdly I’ve wanted to wear a bow tie since I was a kid but always thought I couldn’t bc I didn’t think it would look good on my womany body. Which was weird because it felt like a really big deal for me to get a bow tie and wear it and I don’t think my partner quite understood why. 

Also I started going by a nickname for my very femme given name which is typically seen as male like 6 years ago but feels just more gender neutral/comfy on me and now when people call me by my full femme sounding name I feel... like off because feel like that name sounds too.. girly/delicate/weird on me?

And I know this is very important to people’s identities so I mean this question just out of my own lack of understanding of gender as a concept and of my own gender. But I feel like since you can be any gender and have any body parts and express yourself in anyway gender identity itself has no meaning to me? And like I don’t understand what it means to feel like a woman. I’m afab and I feel like my “woman” experiences are related to that I have certain body parts and experience the oppression/violence of walking through the world perceived as a woman and I feel that violence contributes to a strong part of my identity. But the person I was talking this through with said that I don’t understand the feeling of not feeling the right gender because I’ve never had to think about it as a presumably cis person and that I never had a problem with puberty and all that. But then I felt very upset and emotional unexpectedly because that’s not actually true. I was really upset at puberty when I started getting boobs. And I feel like over time I’ve kind of gotten used to them and done emotional work to try to accept/ignore my body. And I think that’s tied to multiple things like violence/body image around food but also to gender. I’m kind of interested in trying a binder just like to see how I would feel in it but I haven’t talked to anyone in my life about this and I feel nervous about talking to my partner about it who I live with I guess. \n\nI also started wearing button down shirts and wore a bow tie to a wedding a few months ago which weirdly I’ve wanted to wear a bow tie since I was a kid but always thought I couldn’t bc I didn’t think it would look good on my womany body. Which was weird because it felt like a really big deal for me to get a bow tie and wear it and I don’t think my partner quite understood why. \n\nAlso I started going by a nickname for my very femme given name which is typically seen as male like 6 years ago but feels just more gender neutral/comfy on me and now when people call me by my full femme sounding name I feel... like off because feel like that name sounds too.. girly/delicate/weird on me? I’m not sure. I know that it doesn’t necessarily have to all make sense. \n\nI don’t really have a specific question. Sorry that was long. I just feel confused and kind of upset/sad when I think about it and i don’t know ', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Confused', 'created': 1547040889.0}"

________
I've had a friend for a long time, and value her friendship. But thanks to being bi (I suspect), I have passing thoughts of being more than friends with just about everyone (including her) because most of the qualities I like in my friends, I also like in my partners (go figure). It's a running joke -- ""We can't be friends with anyone.. .there are no friends, there is only prey. We are... the bilociraptors. Screeeeee!""

I don't feel strongly sexually attracted to pretty much everyone, or that might point me in a direction.

I'm just wondering how other people sort through all this, because most of the queer community still has some scripts to go off of, and their communities and social expectations are clearer.

Gender identity is interwoven into sexuality, and when both are fluid, it makes separating romantic interest from friendship a lot harder.

- Wearing heels after leg day is a very bad idea
- Women live longer than men unless you count the difference in time spent in the bathroom; I did the math. I didn't include time spent waiting in line. 
- Jeans for men are comfy even when meant to be snug.
- Jeans for women have been known to cause temporary paralysis. 
- Women really do have a better sense of smell. It has to be hormones because F2Ms douse themselves with Axe too and are oblivious.
- Men say ""oops!"" and women say ""oop!"" ... and I don't know why this difference exists.
- It can break someone's brain when they can't work out someone's gender. Like, CTRL+ALT+DEL... some people just freeze up.
- Youtube is full of lies. It's always harder than it looks. *Always*.
- Almost nobody thinks they're sexist. 
- Almost everyone thinks they're accepting/tolerant.
- Everyone is wrong about the last two. 
- I broke down for no apparent reason in the cat food aisle awhile back. None of my (female) friends thought this was in any way unusual or noteworthy. As a guy, this would have been a cause for great concern -- now it's Tuesday. I'm the same person. 
- As a guy, when I went to the doctor and said I was in pain, they ordered tests, asked lots of questions, and referred me to numerous experts.
- As a woman, I'm pretty much on my own unless I have a sucking chest wound and am literally spewing blood all over their shoes. 
- Men's sizing is quantifiable and objective. Women's sizing is a fractal shit show.

I didn\'t include time spent waiting in line. \n- Jeans for men are comfy even when meant to be snug.\n- Jeans for women have been known to cause temporary paralysis. \n- Women really do have a better sense of smell. It has to be hormones because F2Ms douse themselves with Axe too and are oblivious.\n- Men say ""oops!"" and women say ""oop!"" ... and I don\'t know why this difference exists.\n- It can break someone\'s brain when they can\'t work out someone\'s gender. Like, CTRL+ALT+DEL... some people just freeze up.\n- Youtube is full of lies. It\'s always harder than it looks. *Always*.\n- Almost nobody thinks they\'re sexist. \n- Almost everyone thinks they\'re accepting/tolerant.\n- Everyone is wrong about the last two. \n- I broke down for no apparent reason in the cat food aisle awhile back.

I\'m the same person. \n- As a guy, when I went to the doctor and said I was in pain, they ordered tests, asked lots of questions, and referred me to numerous experts.\n- As a woman, I\'m pretty much on my own unless I have a sucking chest wound and am literally spewing blood all over their shoes. \n- Men\'s sizing is quantifiable and objective.

A while ago, I decided to trawl lgbt related tags on twitter, and came across a salty post along the lines of ""if you call yourself genderqueer but look like your assigned gender, you're just a spicy cis"". And usually stuff like that doesn't bother me, because I know I shouldn't waste my emotion on dumb internet things, but... this time it did, and it's been hanging on my back since then.

Ever since I started to take my search for gender-related closure more seriously, it's made me feel progressively more alienated as a person. Binary trans people are already a niche minority group compared to the rest of society. The further you stray from that, the more radicalized the population becomes. And I've noticed, the less it becomes about gender itself and the more it becomes about a subcultural identity. The more I think about it, the more I realize that although what I encountered in that twitter post in particular was blatant, the attitude itself not an isolated thing.

It's incredibly depressing to know that not only does society at large view my personal struggles as either nonexistant (if I don't reveal my struggles) or attention seeking behavior (if I were to), but also that even within the group of people who populate the LGBT community, my struggles don't count because I'm not visibly queer. I get the feeling I'm significantly older than most of the people who frequent various nonbinary-spectrum communities. Coming out, much less visibly presenting, is not an option for me, and it will never be. I grew up in a conservative religious household and my relationship with my family is a strained and complex one. I get the impression that not a lot of people in these communities understand the reality of what it's like to have that kind of family. I cannot afford to publicly express my gender in the way that helps me alleviate dysphoria, and I can even less afford to give myself a hip, queer makeover to fit in. It would cost me my family ties, and it would provide ammo to make work life a living hell.

I additionally cannot relate to the radicalization in the nonbinary community. So many queer memes are based in communism, or anarchism, or sufficiently steeped in edginess that it turns me off. I consider myself genderqueer because of my dysphoria, but I don't want to be associated with all of the extra assumed politics that come with declaring queerness. I feel like I can't even mention this to the precious few people I trust out of embarrassment of association.

It hurts to realize there is a bustling queer community that I can't relate to. It hurts to realize I have to shoulder my dysphoria alone and silently because I will never belong. It hurts to feel alienated and unwanted by what should be my own community.

2019-01-18 07:54:00,ah884v,2,1,"So since the middle of last year, I have been very confused as to what my actual gender is. I am 23 and AMAB.

To give some story, it started when one of my BFFs told me that most of my mannerisms (the way I acted around them) was mostly feminine. At that point, I was both shocked and (I guess) happy at the same time that my friends perceived me as that. Since then, I first bought colored nail polish as to enjoy wearing nail polish and breaking the stigma that ""guys should not wear nail polish unless it's clear. I bought it both for the appeal and because I had a bad habit of chewing on my nails, so this helped out a lot. Once I got comfortable with wearing nail polish, I soon started buying more colors to try wearing (mostly different shades of blue and white).

Few months later, next thing I know my mind gravitates buying mostly feminine outfits than masculine outfits, mostly because I could never find anything appealing to me that just says ""Wow, this would look pretty on me"". So about August/September of 2018 is when I started buying more feminine outfits. I was still buying masculine outfits for everyday wear, just not as much. Today every time I go clothes shopping, I mostly just go towards the ladies section and shop there first before the mens section.

Back in early November 2018, I went to an Ulta Beauty store and asked one of the hair dressers in the Salon area about possibly giving me a pixie style haircut. After looking at some pictures on Pinterest and seeing the many styles and how interesting they looked, I really wanted to see how well a hair style like those would work on me. They told me that my hair would need to be long enough in order to get the results that I want. Last I spoke to them was 3 weeks ago. So hopefully next week I'll be able to go back in there and ""maybe"" get my hair cut the way I'd like to go for.

Since November of 2018, I have also shaved my legs, chest and arm hair because I feel as though body hair just gets in the way and especially with my body, most of my chest hair was really ""belly"" hair and to me just looking disgusting if you are trying to impress other people. And just in general, I really hated it. While shaving my belly hair, I figured I'd shave my upper chest hair and then shave my legs and arm hair. Shaving my legs (to me) was a blessing because now my legs feel smoother than ever, even if I have to shave them again every once in a while (same goes for the rest). I also shave my face every other day because someone who's feminine does not/should not have facial hair (plus I've just never really liked it).

Last month I bought makeup (lipstick, lip liner, foundation, primer, a facial brush, sponge, mirror, and removal wipes) and a makeup bag to put it all of my makeup and nail polish in. I've also considered moving my feminine clothes out from a box just strictly for them into the rest of my masculine wardrobe so that I can wear some masculine things one day and possibly a feminine outfit the next or vice versa.

I've also consider about possibly going on HRT and transition myself to look more feminine.

I have not yet ""come out"" to my parents, whom I would like for them to be the first ones to hear about it before I really confirm anything else to anyone, whether it be friends, other family members, etc.  


So in short, out of what I have said here, I'd just like to know if my ""assigned gender"" has changed every since I've considered myself a cisgender male. I'd like to believe that I could be either androgynous or a Transfeminine, but I'd like to get some feedback/ideas/input from y'all as to what y'all think my real gender could be. Yes, I do understand that finding out my real gender is something that should be explored by myself, but I have done some research and I figure if I post something like this here, that I could possibly get some answers/advice.  


TL/DR: Friend tells me that I act like a girl and so I've been acting more lady-like to the point of wanting to wear things that women would wear, even to the point of deciding to get a feminine hair cut soon and wearing makeup.",genderqueer,Confused about my gender,1547823240.0,"{'created_utc': 1547798040, 'id': 'ah884v', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'So since the middle of last year, I have been very confused as to what my actual gender is.

Today every time I go clothes shopping, I mostly just go towards the ladies section and shop there first before the mens section.\n\nBack in early November 2018, I went to an Ulta Beauty store and asked one of the hair dressers in the Salon area about possibly giving me a pixie style haircut. After looking at some pictures on Pinterest and seeing the many styles and how interesting they looked, I really wanted to see how well a hair style like those would work on me. They told me that my hair would need to be long enough in order to get the results that I want. Last I spoke to them was 3 weeks ago. So hopefully next week I\'ll be able to go back in there and ""maybe"" get my hair cut the way I\'d like to go for.\n\nSince November of 2018, I have also shaved my legs, chest and arm hair because I feel as though body hair just gets in the way and especially with my body, most of my chest hair was really ""belly"" hair and to me just looking disgusting if you are trying to impress other people. And just in general, I really hated it. While shaving my belly hair, I figured I\'d shave my upper chest hair and then shave my legs and arm hair. Shaving my legs (to me) was a blessing because now my legs feel smoother than ever, even if I have to shave them again every once in a while (same goes for the rest). I also shave my face every other day because someone who\'s feminine does not/should not have facial hair (plus I\'ve just never really liked it).\n\nLast month I bought makeup (lipstick, lip liner, foundation, primer, a facial brush, sponge, mirror, and removal wipes) and a makeup bag to put it all of my makeup and nail polish in. I\'ve also considered moving my feminine clothes out from a box just strictly for them into the rest of my masculine wardrobe so that I can wear some masculine things one day and possibly a feminine outfit the next or vice versa.\n\nI\'ve also consider about possibly going on HRT and transition myself to look more feminine.\n\nI have not yet ""come out"" to my parents, whom I would like for them to be the first ones to hear about it before I really confirm anything else to anyone, whether it be friends, other family members, etc.  \n\n\nSo in short, out of what I have said here, I\'d just like to know if my ""assigned gender"" has changed every since I\'ve considered myself a cisgender male. I\'d like to believe that I could be either androgynous or a Transfeminine, but I\'d like to get some feedback/ideas/input from y\'all as to what y\'all think my real gender could be. Yes, I do understand that finding out my real gender is something that should be explored by myself, but I have done some research and I figure if I post something like this here, that I could possibly get some answers/advice.  \n\n\nTL/DR: Friend tells me that I act like a girl and so I\'ve been acting more lady-like to the point of wanting to wear things that women would wear, even to the point of deciding to get a feminine hair cut soon and wearing makeup.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Confused about my gender', 'created': 1547823240.0}"

I'm 23 and AFAB. I've been shedding a lot of internalized heteronormativity these past few years, and in doing so there's been a lot of closeted/buried feelings and issues that have come to light in full force since I've paid more attention to my inner voice(vs the internalized voices from my parents and the rest of the world), if any of that makes sense?

One of the biggest issues was how much I hated my large chest as a kid, and looking at myself in the mirror causes a lot of grief. I developed really early in elementary school and along with being an asexual who was sexualized at a young age, there's just a lot of mess there... A lot of distain for my body. I remember girls wanting to stuff their bras with tissues and all I wanted to do was wrap Saran wrap around my chest. All the shitty comments from my narc mother about my large chest, boys poking and grabbing and laughing, girls saying they wish they had what I have, saying I should be grateful for what I was born with, etc etc... I feel disgusted with my own body and my hatred wants me to chop them off completely. But I still have days where I really like seeing my feminine body in the mirror, I like how I look in some dresses and feeling feminine is just as much a part of me as wanting to chop my boobs off with a guillotine.

Any case, I'm taking a shot and trying binding for the first time to see if that helps minimize the sickness I feel towards my body on days where I'm not comfortable seeing a female figure. My problem is, I'm worried about the largeness of my chest, if binding doesn't work the way I want it to(large boobs being binded still show enough boob to look feminine vs masculine) and if it will harm any tissues at all by binding(last time I measured my size I was 36GG and I'm worried about the large size). Would it be worth it to actually get a substantial reduction instead of binding first? I'm an incredibly sweaty person and also wondering if using Gold Bond while binding would help with any discomfort there.

2019-01-19 04:01:55,ahimoi,7,1,"Hey yall
sorry for the whining and the throwaway account but I've been in a not so good place recently.
Just a lot of venting

Like the title says, I genuinely hate being nonbinary and all the assumptions that come with it.

My identity is not a political statement.

I'm not proud of my indentity (though I support people who are) and have no desire to ""shove it in people's faces"" as the transphobes like to say. I just don't have the luxury of being stealth, and therefore, will ALWAYS have to choose between severe dysphoria or being out.

I have atypical and likely incurable dysphoria. It can probably be lessened, but not eliminated. It's my burden to carry for my whole life. I have a right to bitch about it.

I don't demand special treatment like cis people seem to think. I just want equal treatment, and I'm not even provided with that.

Terfs seem to have this idea that all afab transpeople are trans because ""the patriacrchy!!!"" and ""misogyny!!!"" but I have an atypical experience here too. I don't suffer from internalized misogyny (mostly because I'm not a woman, but yknow), but I've also somehow never been a victim of misogyny or any type of oppression, discrimination, or harrassment because of my AGAB. Given that I've somehow avoided those factors, why would they be my motive to transition?

A lot of cis people seem to believe that my identity is based solely on stereotypes. It has nothing to do with that at all. I've always been a little more masc leaning. Why couldn't I just be a gender nonconforming girl? Because Im not a girl. God I wish I could be a girl, I really do, but I'm not. 

A lot of binary trans people are under the impression I'm a ""transtrender"" because ""nonbinary people don't have dysphoria and just claim to be trans to fit in""

I have severe social dysphoria

bottom dysphoria

chest dysphoria

voice dysphoria

height dysphoria

I had dysphoria even before puberty.

I came out for the first time around age 6 or 7. Then again around 12. Then 15. Then 18. I was always ignored because ""what if it's a phase?"". No one pressured me to be trans. I desperately wish I could be a cis girl, or at least a trans man so maybe I could have curable dysphoria.

I don't give a damn about challenging gender or enforcing/not enforcing stereotypes.
That's not it at all.

I'm not ""confused"" I'm just agender.

I want to be stealth so bad but it can never happen if I want to be happy.

I just want to be treated like an actual person and understood.
I want to stop being accused of ""faking"".

About 10 months ago I started causally seeing a nonbinary person (female at birth, I apologise if that's not the correct way to say that). since then our ""causal"" relationship has evolved into some much more serious and we are now thinking about dating. I really think I found someone special here.


This is where things get abit more complicated. untill now I have only been interested in woman and I have alot of mixed feelings. My partner experiences chest disphoria and has expressed to me that they would be interested in having surgery. I am worried that this might change how I feel about them. As a streight male I am attracted to breasts and a more female image. 

I fear it will become more difficult if they look less female to blend into my traditional place in society with them as my partner witch raises a whole host of stuggles/questions.

Also my mother past away from Breast cancer a few years ago. She had surgery and i witnessed her struggle with the opposite kind of disphoria after that. I am worried that seeing my partners chest in the future might be a traumatic reminder of my past. *Deffinetly a mood killer during sex.


I really care about them and want to be with them but I also don't want to enter into a relationship that maybe I will think differently about in the future. I feel really horrible that this is even a question for me. If you love someone you love them but there are always compromises.

2019-01-19 16:39:20,ahnlo6,14,1,"Hi there. I was wondering if anyone else here experiences this sort of thing. To give you some context, I'm 27, afab and don't have a clear sense of gender.

So, to begin with: I've always had difficulty recognizing and expressing emotions, which I initially attributed to my parents being dysfunctional when I was a child, but lately came to think might be just a part of my personality (INTJ type). When I was in primary school, I started developing something like an alternative world in my head, with different people, different places, etc. A realistic world, no dragons or stuff like that.

I would ""go"" there mentally when I was bored, mostly, and just imagine different situations. It's always been with me, even if there were long stretches of time when I didn't do that. There is one central character who's always been there even when other characters changed. He has a name and a distinct personality, very similar to my own. 

A few years ago I realized that at times I invest more emotional energy in that other world than in my real life. Initially it made me sad and feeling like I'm crazy, but then I realized that having this parallel world in my head helps me to recognize my emotions in real life better. Because oftentimes I imagine situations that I wish could happen in real life (and in this way I find out what I would like to happen) or I imagine situations that are pretty similar to what is actually happening, just with different people involved (and this helps me realize how I'm feeling about a given situation).

I told my therapist, who I've been seeing for ~5 years now, about it and she didn't think I was crazy, I think she even said it's good that I have a way of figuring out my emotions. What I didn't tell her, was the part about the central character being consistently male throughout the years. And I'm beginning to wonder what this means for me. Lately I've been thinking that it's my way of ""living"" my life as a male person, and that maybe I somehow need this to connect to my feelings and make sense of them. It feels strange to be thinking this but also surprisingly natural.

It\'s always been with me, even if there were long stretches of time when I didn\'t do that. There is one central character who\'s always been there even when other characters changed. He has a name and a distinct personality, very similar to my own. \n\nA few years ago I realized that at times I invest more emotional energy in that other world than in my real life. Initially it made me sad and feeling like I\'m crazy, but then I realized that having this parallel world in my head helps me to recognize my emotions in real life better. Because oftentimes I imagine situations that I wish could happen in real life (and in this way I find out what I would like to happen) or I imagine situations that are pretty similar to what is actually happening, just with different people involved (and this helps me realize how I\'m feeling about a given situation).\n\nI told my therapist, who I\'ve been seeing for ~5 years now, about it and she didn\'t think I was crazy, I think she even said it\'s good that I have a way of figuring out my emotions. What I didn\'t tell her, was the part about the central character being consistently male throughout the years. And I\'m beginning to wonder what this means for me. Lately I\'ve been thinking that it\'s my way of ""living"" my life as a male person, and that maybe I somehow need this to connect to my feelings and make sense of them. It feels strange to be thinking this but also surprisingly natural.\n\nThanks for reading all this if you have.

2019-01-25 06:02:32,ajm49x,8,1,"So it's late. I just laid down to sleep after comforting a sick friend/roommate with a cuddle and a temple massage. And it struck me that as an AMAB, this would be contextualized differently than if I'd been born female. And I got to thinking about a lot of things that for me is just friendship that others would see as something else.


As a guy, this would be something reserved for a romantic interest. A lot of affectionate displays and comforting others would be. Even something like hugging is viewed that way. Like my nephew. He's 8 now and doesn't like goodbye hugs anymore. But my two nieces I couldn't leave without at least three. 


Being gender queer makes how I express affection and how it is perceived awkward at times. I'm never quite sure what the protocol is. People who are more accepting don't have as big of a problem with things like hugs or kisses on the head. But I've seen it cuts both ways. AFABs who prefer handshakes also seem uncomfortable when hugged at times. It's a barrier whichever side of queer someone is on.


I try not to let it get to me. The other day I went to a Leann Chin and a girl there was new and for flustered. As a customer I asked if she wanted a hug. She almost burst into tears and said ""YES!"" and we hugged and gave our names. That's not something two guys would do. But it felt natural to me.


That's the thing about gender though. Sometimes it's hard to tell where identity ends and personality begins. Am I just a touchy feely person or is it because that's what's expected, or is it forced unconsciously. I don't have good answers. But to me, handshake or hug was
a bigger question than what bathroom to use. At work, guessing wrong could be seen as sexual harassment. But doing neither comes off as aloof or cold. 


It also struck me how we interact with friends can be so
different. Two girls can kiss goodbye and nobody thinks twice. Or netflix and curling up on each other. Two guys and they have to be gay. Or sit on opposite sides of the couch. But what about non binary people? It might seem like they're picking a ""side"". And it's common to hear people comment like ""well, if he wants to be a guy, he shouldn't do that."" What if they're just more affectionate? What if it's a personal choice of personality instead of social identity? Shouldn't that be validated too? Does it have to mean more?


There's no guide on where the boundaries are. Often times it feels like I'm just blundering around in ambiguity.  Can I cuddle a sick friend? Should I offer? How would it come off? These are questions I ask often, things that for other people it would be obvious. And it can be jarring to do what feels natural to me but the other person gets awkward about.


But as awkward as it can sometimes be, choosing to be affectionate instead of safely remaining distant is a choice I'll keep making. I don't know if it makes me more of a woman, less of a man, or just is who I am. I just know that it's a colder, harder world to always pick the safe choice. To remain gender neutral in a world that does its best every day to make me choose a side is a hard fight. And sometimes I don't give a damn what side I'm on.

2019-01-28 03:05:43,akj5xe,0,1,"Before I start, I want to clarify a few things about why I am making this post.

Talking about indifference, apathy, pomogender etc. at length might be uncharted territory for a lot of communities. People talking about this are few and far between (considering the few people who do find it worth their time to talk about it). Some definitions of apathy describe it very similar to gender non-conformity but I think there are enough differences with the mindset and behavior to differentiate it.

I thought it would be helpful add my two cents to the understanding of indifference. I'm not be best case study; I'm in early stages of defining what I am and others may have drastically differing experiences later in their journey. Also my platonic behavior might be tied to asexual traits but I think there are enough differing traits to make a distinction.

I am not making the claim that indifferents are a suppressed individuals; based on my lifestyle, indifference is probably inconsequential with how I live my life and my place in society. Also, I'm not trying to claim that pronouns are unimportant; pronouns/roles are very important, they ascribe internal/external qualities, have a social function and they make English the convoluted lovable trashy language that it is.

With that out of the way, I hope you find that my perspective gives some more light on the topic. I would love to hear differing opinions and experiences regarding this (if you are willing).

Hi, I'm Jacob.

I'm 24 years old.

Not too long ago, I publicly told the void that  ""I'm indifferent to my gender"". What I wrote took me aback. I had to ask myself, am I actually questioning my gender or am I just at odds with how society expects archetypal male traits from me?

I'm born male. I look like a male, I walk and talk like a male and that's okay... I guess... I don't feel the urge to change my appearance to more butch or fem. I always lived comfortably in this body so I might as well keep it this way. I don't mind people deliberately misgendering me, in some scenarios it can be endearing. I look after kids a lot of the time so ""aunty"" or ""koka"" (Te Reo for aunty) is appropriate sometimes. If you wanna be endearing and call me gal, girlfriend, dude, guy, bro or sis, that's cool. If an ass tries to call me miss, maam mistress mrs, or lady, I'm not entirely phased. For my use, titles and pronouns have either a sentimental or utilitarian function. Apart from the descriptive use I don't demand titles cause they are meaningless to me; not for socio-political reasons, just that my birth-sex doesn't  play a part in how I interact or exchange in my community. I can fit comfortably and/or passively in a lot of groups; whether be a circle of aunties, a bunch of farming blokes, sisters getting together for a reality TV marathon, it hasn't much consequence, there is no lynch mob from me gardening or taking pottery instead of plumbing. 

Now this is where I talk about some of my asexual traits. I may not be giving a complete picture of what indifference is; but I should probably mention it.

I never really felt the desire to explore my sexuality with other people. Some people might brush me off as a virgin (that's okay, I'm fine with that) but when I picture desire or attraction with other, I can only see platonic romantic interactions with people. I have a drive, I have visual cues for attraction but it's not how I actually desire for relationships.

&amp;#x200B;

I am biologically and chemically male but being that is meaningless to me. My personality comes from something deeper in my soul, something that flows through all forms of my relationships.

People talking about this are few and far between (considering the few people who do find it worth their time to talk about it). Some definitions of apathy describe it very similar to gender non-conformity but I think there are enough differences with the mindset and behavior to differentiate it.\n\nI thought it would be helpful add my two cents to the understanding of indifference. I\'m not be best case study; I\'m in early stages of defining what I am and others may have drastically differing experiences later in their journey. Also my platonic behavior might be tied to asexual traits but I think there are enough differing traits to make a distinction.\n\nI am not making the claim that indifferents are a suppressed individuals; based on my lifestyle, indifference is probably inconsequential with how I live my life and my place in society. Also, I\'m not trying to claim that pronouns are unimportant; pronouns/roles are very important, they ascribe internal/external qualities, have a social function and they make English the convoluted lovable trashy language that it is.\n\nWith that out of the way, I hope you find that my perspective gives some more light on the topic. I would love to hear differing opinions and experiences regarding this (if you are willing).\n\nHi, I\'m Jacob.\n\nI\'m 24 years old.\n\nNot too long ago, I publicly told the void that  ""I\'m indifferent to my gender"". What I wrote took me aback. I had to ask myself, am I actually questioning my gender or am I just at odds with how society expects archetypal male traits from me?\n\nI\'m born male. I look like a male, I walk and talk like a male and that\'s okay... I guess... I don\'t feel the urge to change my appearance to more butch or fem. I always lived comfortably in this body so I might as well keep it this way. I don\'t mind people deliberately misgendering me, in some scenarios it can be endearing. I look after kids a lot of the time so ""aunty"" or ""koka"" (Te Reo for aunty) is appropriate sometimes. If you wanna be endearing and call me gal, girlfriend, dude, guy, bro or sis, that\'s cool. If an ass tries to call me miss, maam mistress mrs, or lady, I\'m not entirely phased. For my use, titles and pronouns have either a sentimental or utilitarian function. Apart from the descriptive use I don\'t demand titles cause they are meaningless to me; not for socio-political reasons, just that my birth-sex doesn\'t  play a part in how I interact or exchange in my community. I can fit comfortably and/or passively in a lot of groups; whether be a circle of aunties, a bunch of farming blokes, sisters getting together for a reality TV marathon, it hasn\'t much consequence, there is no lynch mob from me gardening or taking pottery instead of plumbing. \n\nNow this is where I talk about some of my asexual traits. I may not be giving a complete picture of what indifference is; but I should probably mention it.\n\nI never really felt the desire to explore my sexuality with other people. Some people might brush me off as a virgin (that\'s okay, I\'m fine with that) but when I picture desire or attraction with other, I can only see platonic romantic interactions with people. I have a drive, I have visual cues for attraction but it\'s not how I actually desire for relationships.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn summary, what do I feel like? \n\nI am biologically and chemically male but being that is meaningless to me.

Being genderfluid/gender non-conforming hasn't been something I've had time to deal with since I wrote that last post, but I'm back here now!

Who on here *enjoys* thrift stores, and do you think they're good for finding things that you wouldn't find elsewhere?

There's one I go to [here in England] and it's a good one - the staff are helpful and friendly even though I'm not sure if LGBT / genderqueer issues are something they're aware of.

I would link to it on Google Street View but would that be spamming, even though I'm not affiliated with them and it's just a recommendation?

A lot of the time I find nice more feminine-looking tops and shorts there for around £2 [ ($2.61 in USD at current exchange rates)  ] - a bargain given their RRP would be about £20-£30 when new!

&amp;#x200B;

I feel fine calling myself a ""woman"" but I don't necessarily feel like only a woman or like the ""woman"" I am expected to be. Wearing skirts or dresses makes me want to crawl out of my skin. It makes me so uncomfortable, just thinking about it makes me feel physically disgusted. The last time I put on a dress was for my sister's wedding and before then, the last time was over 7 years ago. I also hate knowing/thinking about that I have a uterus, and sometimes I think I would prefer having a penis and I daydream about having a penis during sex. I don't hate having a vagina and labia  (it's really the uterus that disgusts me--I used to feel uncomfortable with a vagina), but some days I would prefer a penis. Pregnancy all around also disgusts me and even thinking about ever being pregnant makes my skin crawl. 

&amp;#x200B;

I recently cut my hair extremely short (above my ears in a men's style) after having it down to my shoulder blades for years, and I got a men's suit. I have never felt that validated or sexy before in my life. I remember looking in the mirror after the hairstylist finished cutting my hair, and I was ecstatic. I now only wear men's business clothes and almost all of my casual clothes are masculine. 

&amp;#x200B;

I recently used they/them pronouns in a social setting, and it felt really nice. I also tried giving the option of either she/her/her's and they/them/theirs to people and that felt even better/more validating.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I don't feel any discomfort about my breasts---in fact, I love having them. They are pretty small and I have never tried binding, however. When I did have long hair, I did feel comfortable, but it didn't bring nearly as much joy as having my short hair + dressing masculine. 

&amp;#x200B;

Up until age 13, I hated being called a girl and being associated with anything ""girly."" But I also hated being called a boy. I thought I was non-binary when I was 18, but I was barely comfortable with my non-straight sexuality at that point so I was too scared to think too much about it. Every few months, these questions return to me and I pack it away out of fear.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I don't feel terrible about being seen as a woman, but I definitely feel different than what one would consider a ""typical"" cisgender woman. I'm not sure where I fall or if these are similar feelings other cisgender women have or if I'm more a butch cisgender lesbian.

Anyway, recently my feelings about my gender confusion have escalated. I am not sure what I am? Both? Neither? Definitely not one or the other, so that’s something. I have tried to start chest binding but found it incredibly painful and anxiety-filled due to the construction. I’ve also tried KT tape but that is better but it irritates my skin to the point if painful blisters. I’m not sure what to do. 

I guess I’m just looking for other people’s stories. What was your journey like? Are you still on it? Why is everyone so obsessed with labels? You know, the good stuff. 

Thanks in advance ❤️

2019-01-31 17:44:25,als1dj,11,1,"I haven't had to worry about correcting people in a while; a year ago I moved out to the queer district of a liberal city where no one knew me before and people mostly just got it, and before that I was correcting people as an ostensibly binary trans woman which was super easy. (Well, easier) I moved away from where I grew up and got a whole lot queerer, but three weeks ago I moved in with my parents and... It's been uncomfortable.

Everyone still wants to use he/him or (much more often) she/her and I'm realizing I feel like I can't correct them anymore. With she/her it was different; I pretty much knew people would take me seriously and get the idea when I said it, but that certainty evaporated when I came back as something less neat and conforming. Most people just won't get it, I know how cis (and many trans) people talk about us, and even when they're supportive they don't think about it the same way as they do with binary trans people.

I can't correct them because now its superficial. I'm not a ""woman trapped in a man's body"" anymore; I'm something less serious and important even to the people who I know will go along with my pronouns. I can read it way too clearly on their faces, and that might honestly be more painful than them getting it wrong. 

The real reason I don't correct people though is because if I start doing it I'm also starting a timer until I hit a snag. I'll always be waiting on the other shoe to drop, because it *will*, (and probably quickly) when I finally hit someone who'll make it a big deal, someone unafraid of announcing that they just don't get it and challenging me. In that moment I'm not going to have the wherewithall to be an educator, and that'll cause a lot more pain than the sum total of misgendering.

So I shut up and take the she/her lumps I asked for, I guess. I... Don't really have a point here.
