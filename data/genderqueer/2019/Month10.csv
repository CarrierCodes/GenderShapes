2019-10-01 17:50:33,dbwz6j,5,0,"To follow up my last post here, which was better received than expected, I want to spill my guts even more about my interest in preserving the feminine penis. 

So, I have never really been with a woman. I’m only realizing now that I have some internalized misogyny (or more accurately, gynophobia) that was likely the result of my mom having postpartum depression, and a sadistic school teacher, as well as the usual “mean girl” stuff in my tweens and teens. So I can barely pursue a friendship with another woman, forget about a romance! I feel attracted to women from afar, but I think I have some kind of psychosexual block when it comes to the idea of actually being intimate with another woman...

But... I can see myself being with a trans woman, especially if she has a penis. I’ve become obsessed with the idea recently, fantasizing in more detail than ever before (even in my previous fantasies about men). 

I realize that I might be harmful to a trans woman if I pursued her irl, risking fetishizing her penis just like cis male “chasers” do. Ew. I don’t want to be like that! But I do really want a woman with a penis, a woman who has been socialized as a male initially, because that makes her less threatening to me. Isn’t that a switcheroo of the normal story, where natal *females* are supposed to be “safe”. But I’m talking about emotional safety, as opposed to physical safety.

I can’t help my desires, though. All I can do is try to work through them logically, so that I don’t end up accidentally hurting someone. 

I feel like I’m coming up against some kind of contradiction regarding gender. Like, I can’t figure out whether a woman proudly displaying her dick is masculine, like a creepy flasher, or feminine, like a stripper taking her top off to reveal her boobs. To me, it’s neither, really: I just love the way pretty women look, as well as how penises look, and the idea of combining them is hot to me. Is that transphobic? I feel like my sexuality is way ahead of my logical mind; like my sex drive doesn’t care about gender at all, it’s post-gender, and just wants what it wants, but when I try to analyze and dissect my desire, it starts to confuse me.

Any other AFABs out there who have similar desires? Or anyone who has more experience dealing with trans women’s penises without producing dysphoria in them? I just don’t see this subject come up very often, so I’m a bit lost.

Oh, the other problematic thing is that I think I have legit Penis Envy. But I wonder if I found another woman who has what I want, if we could sort of share it. Is that a thing? I can’t be the only woman out there who feels this way, right?

2019-10-01 19:07:59,dby3x4,2,6,"Hello, I am new to this community and posting on Reddit.

A little bit of backstory and the like:

Straight (but comfortable), White, Male. Raised Catholic, Living Non-Religious. mid-20s. Grew up in a rougher neighborhood with a LOT of white, toxic masculinity, wannabe gangstas.

I have always been a supporter of LGBTQIA+, living non-gender conforming. Basically: live however you want to live, I don't mind as long as you're kind.

But recently. I have for the first time turned the question inward. I recently started drama school and we have to wear leotards for dance (which I didn't mind as I used to do Rocky Horror and used to having fabric up the crack). And a few of the girls were teasing the men (who were horrified at wearing a thong, tights, and a leotard). 

And I was extremely upset, as I didn't feel like I should have been grouped up with these men. (also, not cool making fun of people. I'm used to being bullied, but this felt different). 

I've always hated toxic masculinity (as a I think men are the DEVIL), but I love ""traditional male-things"" playing sports (not watching), weight lifting, and the like. So I always just assumed...I'm male... But I always felt different to everyone else. So I thought ""Maybe I'm bisexual."" Tried it. Not attracted to men. ANYWAYS. I've always tried to live however I want, and be who I am. Which is to live label-free, but I've never put it to gender. 

I have a few Facebook friends who have transitioned or non-binary, and, I don't know, I admire and respect the community, and feel like if I were non-binary, that I would be disrespecting all of them and the community because I don't ""fit"" or I'm not truly ""non-binary or genderqueer"" (hyperbole to hopefully show the painting my mind is trying to convey). Those Facebook friends are a radical bunch though, as they very much hate cis straight men (understandably).

I'm not sure what I'm wanting out of this post. Kinda got away from me. I have a new friend at drama school who identifies as genderqueer (never heard it before) who encouraged me to keep exploring (idk how though). So maybe this is me exploring? 

I'm sorry if I somehow offend someone by my wording, this is all completely with good intentions. You're all wonderful.

SST: But your a girl!

\*I walk over to the sink\*

SST: You just saw me using a urinal and I'm in the boys bathroom...

\*SST Sticks her head into the math room\*

SST: (Math Teachers Name) can I see you for a moment?

MTN: Oh yeah, sure!

\*MTN comes out into the hallway with me and the SST\*

MTN: What seems to be the problem?

\*SST Points to me\*

SST: I saw this young lady snooping in the boys bathroom!

\*MTN face palms\*

MTN: \*sigh\*

MTN: I'll take it from here, go back to class SST...

\*SST walks back to class\*

MTN: I'm so sorry i'll report this to the district as soon as I possibly can.

Me: thanks

MTN: How about you stay in my classroom for the rest of the period.

Me: Ok

MTN: If she asks what I did with you i'll tell her I gave you ISD (In school detention)

Me: Thanks!

2019-10-06 23:22:16,deb5n9,24,18,"I'm bad at explaining these things so please bear with me.

So I've heard conflicting ideas on the term 'trans' in relation to NB/genderqueer (i'll use NB from here on out for brevity) people. I like to think I'm usually quite educated on these things, but this has really confused me: are all NB people inherently trans? I would think not, right? As not all people who are nb feel the need to transition (though some obviously do want HRT, binders, name change etc). 

Take me as an example: I'm AFAB, but identify as agender/genderfluid/genderqueer/nb (no one label does it justice) and I've never taken any steps to transition. My whole life I've just presented in a way that feels right to me, I've never been offended by or felt extremely wrong about being considered female, I've never cared what name or pronouns people use, so I don't consider myself trans because there's no transition. Yes my AGAB doesn't entirely align to my gender experience, but I also have never needed to do anything to actively change.

HOWEVER, even though I don't consider myself trans (and I would think there's other NB people out there who feel similarly), NB always seems to fall under the trans umbrella and be considered a 'trans' identity. It seem to be a conflict between how I view myself and how my identity is ""defined"" in the broader LGBT+ community.

I don't have a real question here, I'm just looking for if there's something I've missed, or if I'm just dealing with misconceptions about being nb, or if anyone has an statistics/info on how people categorise these things. So thank you in advance for any help illuminating this topic for me!

Note 1: This isn't about gender dysphoria, I'm aware that one does not need to experience it to be considered trans and/or nb

There have been large stretches of my life where I have been more than happy being male. Particularly the last 6 years I will go months to years with being satisfied with my current body. There have been times where I have wondered if this is nothing more than a fetish, others where it seems like more. Which has lead to  a lot   
 of cross dressing. I remember  in middle school first seeing that HRT was a thing on youtube I though it was magic and part of me wishing I could do that. A lot of times the place I have ended up is me wishing I could somehow shift between a male and female body at will. The past few months or so has been more intense than before with the desire to be more feminine and its getting more intense each day.Recently I found out about informed consent and am seriously considering it. I am really afraid if I do not fully explore this side of who I am  then I will be living out my older years constantly wondering ""What If?"".  My set of likes and dislikes  about the way I am also make me more confused. I think would like to be a young woman, but I think once I am older I would prefer to be an older man. I also don't mind having male genitals and don't think I would want to get rid of them. There are times where I like having a beard and being a rugged mountain boi, but then there are times where I wish so badly I could be a slender and soft woman with a feminine haircut and makeup. I don't believe my family would understand, but I live in a separate city. My significant other has heard some of these thoughts and is very accepting of my desire to explore,  she is bi and some what non-binary so I am fully confident that she will support me no matter what. My other concern is related to my job. I am afraid that as a transwoman or nonbinary person I will limit my job opportunities in my career. I feel shitty about it, but part of me feels that I will just have an easier time progressing as a cis het male and having a secure career matters to me. I am also afraid that if I start HRT at some point but then back out I will be left with several negative side effects I dont want. I  am almost considering scheduling an appointment for informed consent partially so I can sit with a medical professional and they can lay out what all the medical effects will really be.  I do have some general questions though I was wondering  if I can get some input on as these are some of my primary concerns.

\-Is it do-able to effectively continue to present as male/androgynous at work while going through HRT/exploring, but maintain a more feminine person outside of work?

\-I understand shrinkage of the male genitals occurs once you have been on HRT for a few months (as well as other effects such as permanent sterility and losing the ability to get an erection). If I decided somewhere down the line that I had found out what I needed and decided to go off HRT,  would any size/function return to my genitals?

The rabbit hole is becoming very enticing and I am just worried whether I will be able to climb back out depending on how far I go down. I feel like I just need to explore this part of myself more to be happy in the long term and crossdressing hasn't really been doing it for me. Any thoughts that you may think I will find useful are also appreciated.

2019-10-09 15:42:44,dfiu9x,7,35,"I’ll preface by saying I still feel like I have a lot to learn about gender, but recently have felt like this may be where I belong.  That being said I still have constant doubts for various reasons.

I’m a 32 y.o.  and for years I thought I was a crossdresser or fetishist, but I now think that may have been due to limited knowledge or what I had been exposed to.  My first experience was around the age of ten, I found myself get curious and try on a family members clothes. I loved it and would share a handful of experiences in my teenage years but was limited due to age and accessibility of clothes.

In my 20s it was mostly panties as I didn’t want anyone to know about it and they were easy to wear without anyone knowing, but I had the desire to wear leggings and dresses and all sorts of clothes. The desire to wear men’s clothes remained, though I found myself getting increasingly bored when shopping in men’s sections as the years went on.  About mid 20s I started to find sections of the internet filled with other crossdressers and began to realize I was not as alone as I had previously thought. I think this had Both a positive and negative affect on me as it turned something that wasn’t previously sexual in nature into a fetish that I’d debatably abuse over the next few years. More recently I realize that it’s not a fetish as I enjoy being dressed in women’s clothes even when not participating in sexual acts. That being said most the time I feel like mixing clothes, something like a men’s flannel with leggings and earrings and maybe makeup.  

I‘ve been considering this is more than just clothes. When I think about my younger years I can recall I never felt like I fit in with other boys and masculinity in general. Everyone loved sports and cars and locker room talk. Not to say you can’t be feminine and into those things, but I definitely found cooking and gardening to be more my style. I also found talking to women easier, they were always more relatable and I’ve always found making friendships with men to be difficult.

My problem is that I’ve hid al of it my entire life. Any time I ever showed off bits of a feminine personality or tried to share my crossdressing with a gf it was often met with hostility. These types of reactions led me to bury and pretend to be someone I’m not. I’m finding as I get older I can’t stand it, I can’t keep pretending, I need to be who I am. But the world feels like it has barely changed, and I just dont know how to be me. It is easy to internally say yes I think I may be genderqueer, but when I try to say it out loud I always stop myself and ask am I sure? Because once I open the box it will be out there for everyone.

To make it more complicated, I am married now. My wife is very accepting and enthusiastic towards others but I’m less certain of how she would react if her own husband came out. I’ve tried my best to keep this short but the reality is this feels so complicated and plagued me on a daily basis and my thoughts on the matter seem never ending.

2019-10-11 05:47:19,dgapg6,5,61,"\[Originally posted on r/NonBinary \- thought I would post here as well.\] 

Wanted to share this with some other non-binary/gender neutral folks whose parents are having a hard time accepting them.

My parents have always been extremely critical of me for not fitting their heteronormative expectations about gender identity and sexual orientation ever since I was a young child. Born anatomically female, they foisted every pink, frilly ""girl"" things onto me - clothes, toys, hobbies, everything - as well as punished me for not behaving in a typically ""feminine"" way. Since I was a little kid, I was always a tomboy, and anything my brother was allowed to do, I wanted to do, too. My parents thought it was a tomboy phase and that once I became an adolescent I would become all feminine and be interested in boys (this is a long discussion for another time). As I got older and that never happened, and my interests, mannerisms, and behavior became less and less what they wanted or expected, this caused a huge rift (among other reasons) between my parents and me.

I've had a gender neutral name for almost 10 years now, and it was quite a chore to even get my parents to stop calling me by my (extremely girly and old-fashioned) given name. My mother still refuses, and gets angry and screams at me when I correct her. My father begrudgingly began to call me by my preferred name last year, though he often forgets and I have to remind him.

I'll be 29 in a few days. I always dreaded getting cards from my parents for any occasion because, even from hundreds of miles away, they always still seemed to be trying to enforce their beliefs about my gender onto me. Like they would find the most girly looking cards, with pink and hearts and cursive script and lace and whatever, always for ""daughter"", addressed to ""given name"". This used to bother me so much I threw their cards out without even reading them for many years, because it felt so invalidating and disrespectful. This was even after telling them over and over to please not send me these types of things, and they would always counter by saying something like ""none of the other cards were appropriate"" (???) or they would just get angry and tell me I'm a woman so I better start acting like one.

Today I got a birthday card from my father, and I was surprised to see that it is nothing like the cards he usually sends. It was in a yellow envelope. It's very colorful, but mostly blue and green. It has a cute doggy sketch on the front with balloons and a present. The script, while still cursive, is black. It doesn't say ""daughter"" anywhere. It's addressed to my preferred name.

It's really very touching, because it seems he went out of his way to try to find the most unoffensive and gender neutral card that he could. Honestly, I teared up a little when I saw it. I'm sure a lot of people are rolling their eyes right now saying I'm overreacting or being a sensitive wuss or a special snowflake or whatever nonsense, but it's so different from how it's always been. It's such a little thing but it means a lot to me. I never thought either one of my parents would ever be accepting or try to understand at all (my mother still refuses; my parents divorced several years ago, but that's neither here nor there). I've noticed too, over the last few months, my father has been asking me about gender identity and LGBTQIA issues in general, not like he's trying to be offensive or anything, but like he's genuinely curious and wants to understand. He also corrects himself more when he calls me by my given name. I have no idea why he's suddenly being like this, because he never was. If he didn't agree with something or experience it himself, he thought it was stupid or not real. My step-mom, though, is much more open-minded than either of my parents ever were, so maybe she's been a good influence on him.

I just wanted to share this. If anyone is having trouble getting through to their parents or if their parents refuse to accept you for who you are, one day they might realize their mistakes and come around. My father is nearing old age now, and he's lived the majority of his life being very black and white in his beliefs.

The big thing is that for as long as I can remember, I've loved wearing women's clothes. Not necessarily full blown crossdressing with makeup and stuff, but I've loved all clothes; skirts, leggings, heels, flats, cardigans, panties, etc. I'm not confident enough to go out in public looking so feminine, but I do like to subtly wear a few women's clothing pieces with my more traditionally male clothes (ie skinny jeans/heeled booties with a men's top/coat). However, it's not really all the time that I feel the inclination to wear women's clothes. Maybe 50% of the time, I'm very content wearing ""guy clothes"". Sexually, I'm only really attracted to women, and can't really imagine myself ever being different here.

I love being a guy, and have never considered changing that, but I do occasionally think about how cool it would be to be a woman. To be able to go out in skirts and heels and act traditionally feminine without judgement. So here comes the questions I have:

1. Am I just a feminine, occasionally crossdressing man? Or is there some other label that more directly applies to me?
2. Based on my description of myself, are there more people out there similar to me, or am I pretty unique? I'm not trying to sound entitled/special or anything here, I just really don't know. I've tried doing more research, but a lot of stuff on quora/answers that I've found just seem like validation shitposts.
3. Do people in this community generally like labels? Do you like to be associated with your labels, or are they just sort of there to easily explain yourself to other likeminded individuals?

2019-10-15 02:58:12,di1m1t,2,61,"I hit a milestone today. For the first time, I talked myself to going out in public wearing gender-ambiguous clothes, in a place where I knew for certain that I’d be seen (I’ve walked to the mailbox in a variety of outfits, but I’ve never noticed whether anyone saw me). Nothing huge—I just went to the grocery/pharmacy to pick up prescriptions (but I did force myself to go inside and not chicken out by using the drive-through). And the outfit wasn’t blatantly non-masc, just a tunic top and leggings (with my awesome new “moody purple” hi-top Chucks!). But for me, this was a big step up from my previous level of just a long ponytail, full beard, and purse. 

So I feel really good about myself tonight. Combined with last week’s milestone, when while on vacation I saw one of my spouse’s aunts (twice!) while wearing a similar outfit, I’m really starting to feel more comfortable with presenting mixed gender signals. I’m now even planning to go out similarly queered tomorrow (appt with sleep doctor, plus grocery shopping) and Thursday (diabetes education class). (I’m self-employed and work at home, so I don’t have a workplace to use as my outfit test bed.)

Next big step: coming out as enby ace to my sister and mother. (I’m not worried about how my sister will handle it—she’s been part of the local theater community for twenty years and has friends all over the GI/SO spectra—but I don’t think my mother will be quite so open to it. She still doesn’t understand me being Aspie, 15 years after being diagnosed. So I’m sure I’ll be looking for encouragement and support when I get to that.)

This may be a long one, as it’s my first post. Or it may be short! Either way I’ll keep the grace of this opening blurb.

I’m AFAB, mid-20s. When I was about 5 or 6, I used to admire the boys most in shows I watched; quite literally Barney, Power Rangers, etc. Strong boys next to strong girls, so I know it wasn’t an admiration as a result of a power imbalance. I wasn’t attracted to them, so much as I wanted to be them. I would ask my parents to call me male names. In a good mood, they would oblige. It always made me feel euphoric; I’ve always hated my female name, and most non-gender neutral or non-male names. I’ve never identified with my given name. Fast forward, in elementary school I have very vivid memories of wishing to use the restroom as boys did, up to sitting backwards. This resulted in a lot of embarrassment for me, at the time I didn’t have the words as to why, but I can now identify that I was overcome with frustration with how I was anatomically. I hated my breasts and what’s between my legs; sex wasn’t appealing and scared me, because I didn’t want to be able to bear a child.

I had unhealthy relationships with boys and girls my same age; looking back, what I think was assumed attraction to men was actually jealousy, that they could be this way I desired, that they could have the attention from whom I desired. I grew up extremely evangelical; every source of media I consumed was Biblical, but Man’s interpretation, if you understand. My cousin was shunned from our community; my sister basically stood trial for depression and an eating disorder, had her integrity questioned in front of the congregation by elders while she was in the hospital. Everything I was taught was caustic; everything was brimstone. Because of this, I became emotionally and sexually reclusive. Sex scared me. I scared me. Everything resulted in Hell except prayer. Can you feel that anxiety? I wore it for over 20 years.

My first year of college, I met someone who was ftm, online. They became a close friend. They resonated with me, I shared things with them, until they scared me. Because I was 18, and everything I knew still resulted in Hell. I was getting too close to the flame; it felt like I wasn’t allowed to know myself. Because maybe I’ve always known myself.

I’m in a heterosexual marriage now. I know I’m definitely pansexual. Things happened quickly, anxiously, because in Evangelical communities it’s almost like everyone is in competition to establish they are the most straight of all the straights in all the land. It was at warp-speed so I could protect myself. He’s loving, and considerate. We’ve been married three years. He’s my best friend, but it’s a relationship that started in that broody, familiar, I’m-so-jealous-of-you ways. I married who I was jealous of. I steal his clothes when he’s not home, and still loathe my body. Not in a dysmorphic way, but with complete dysphoria. I don’t feel like who I am, and I feel stuck in a parallel universe. I want to be with my husband... as his devoted best friend. That he talks about women with... that I talk about whomever with. Before it gets brought up, yes, I do have an LGBTQ+ counselor. And yes, my husband knows...now. But I have a horrendously hard time verbalizing it to him. How can this person he’s known 7 years, not at all be the person he’s known?

I only confronted my anxiety two years ago, after my third suicide encounter. That was a tipping point. And it feels like the more I tackle my anxiety, the more I’m discovering who I never would allow myself to venture to be. And it’s freeing but mortifying at the same time. My parents have relaxed a bit about their faith, and my abandonment of the church out of fear has led me to find a faith of my own. This has brought a little bit of relief. But at times I find myself jealous of young kids and teens, who grew up with at least possibly affirming classmates and online communities. We had three openly gay classmates at my high school. Two committed suicide. There was no Tumblr, maybe a baby Reddit, a fledgling Twitter. Forget about affirming and supportive places like Instagram. It just didn’t exist. I also know that the existence of these platforms don’t actually make it easier for youth, and often make existence feel even more competitive; my heart hurts for them, because I know that I do at least have the privilege of perspective distance because of my age. But I’ve started to look back on so much of my life as just expansive, dark, frightening years. I was so, so scared of myself. And now that I’m less scared of myself, I’m so, so scared of what that brings.

I don’t feel like this could fit much of anywhere in other forums, and I’m sorry if this violates a community standard. But I’m processing everything so rapidly, and profoundly, that I just needed to put it somewhere other than a journal. It can just sit here, really, and breathe. Because at least I said it.

2019-10-20 23:18:28,dkrmah,2,4,"Thinking out loud, would love feedback on terminology and descriptors as I am still trying to figure this out and having the right language helps me and my nerd brain enormously.

As a primer, I am AFAB and in my mid-30s. When I was young being genderqueer or transgender wasn’t even in the conversation. I knew what “gay” was primarily because it was talked about in school, usually framed as a bad thing. Ironically even though my first romantic and sexual experiences were with femmefolk it didn’t even occur to me that I might be gay because hey, mascfolk could also be hot (being bi/pansexual wasn’t a term used at all when I was young)? 

I feel society underestimates how *powerful* having the language to describe your inner experiences is. Especially when it falls outside the norm. I haven’t had the language. I am developing it with time. After lurking a bit I thought this community would be great for continuing my education and help me work out what is confusing for me, still.

It hit me like a lightning bolt when someone kind pulled me aside and explained that a lot of my dysphoria and self-hatred could be coming from a place of being genderqueer. Now I *know* I am genderqueer but am still feeling conflicted and confused as f\*\*k.

My personal experiences as summarized as follows:

Childhood:

* Did not feel like a girl. Acted boyish and felt deep discomfort and sadness when people would call me a “tomboy.”  
 I didn’t feel like a girl or a boy but felt more comfortable with traditionally masculine/boyish roles (hated pink/dolls, was rough and tumble outdoorsy, etc.). If anyone would have asked me as a kid I would have said I'd was a boy or preferred to be a boy because the gender roles more closely matched there.
* Was forced to keep hair certain way and dress a certain way by parents because I wasn’t “feminine” enough. It hurt a lot and led to a lot of depression due to never expressing my true self. My true self generally dismissed by family and “friends.”
* Did not have any physical dysphoria until puberty hit, then started having severe dysphoria and even depersonalization events.
* Childhood was complicated by numerous childhood traumas (have a diagnosis of cPTSD and PTSD).

Adulthood:

* Sometimes have trouble recognizing my own face in the mirror (from an emotional standpoint). This gets easier when I dress more masculine/androgynous.
* It feels like I am crossdressing or wearing a costume when I wear a dress, for example.
* Have fantasies I have male genitalia, but also of female genitals (just not as often).
* Felt disgust/dysphoria with my female body during sex with previous partners, but it feels good with my current partner to be female in bed (who is AMAB and cis/het).
* Started taking a low dose of testosterone for an unrelated chronic illness and it felt like something “clicked” inside. It felt great. But I am not sure if that’s because it helped my chronic illness AND/OR the gender stuff. Considering pursuing a dose of T that would not be at transitioning-level but something higher than what I have.
* Feel discomfort at female pronouns, feel the rightness when gender-neutral pronouns are used. If someone accidentally calls me “sir” it does not feel bad like someone calling me “ma’am.”
* Got a packer to see how that would feel and it felt good but was not mind-blowing. 
* Gaining weight (I am overweight now) increases by dysphoria in part because it increases my curves.
* I feel a lot of envy for people who can pass as androgynous more than I do for masculine men.
* EVERYTHING is complicated by the fact that I also have a severe (potentially life threatening) chronic illness.

So, what language describes these experiences in YOUR understanding?

I also question whether I could be transgendered but keep landing more on agendered with a propensity to me more comfortable *presenting* on the masculine end of the spectrum (butch agender?). Is that even a thing? Or is that just being transgendered?  

But I am often dismissed when I state I am genderqueer in this respect because I am extremely curvy and not androgynous at all in my physical body. It does not matter how I try and present myself, I get told I am a woman and there is no question. I don’t feel like a woman. I don’t even know what feeling like a woman feels like though, because I’ve never had a feeling like that? I’ve just assumed being a woman WAS that body discomfort/dysphoria, but I’ve been talking to my cis friends about this and apparently their experiences of their own bodies are VERY different than mine.

My initial forays into telling my small world I am genderqueer have been mixed. Friends say it is “too hard” to remember using neutral pronouns. Many freaked out when I changed my name on my social media. My partner of 13 years has been very supportive, luckily. I would lose him as a romantic partner if I ever choose to physically transition. And right now that does not feel like something I want to do though I admit I fantasize about not having this near-constant dysphoria about my body and wonder if being a man would “fix” that.

When I was young being genderqueer or transgender wasn’t even in the conversation. I knew what “gay” was primarily because it was talked about in school, usually framed as a bad thing. Ironically even though my first romantic and sexual experiences were with femmefolk it didn’t even occur to me that I might be gay because hey, mascfolk could also be hot (being bi/pansexual wasn’t a term used at all when I was young)? \n\nI feel society underestimates how *powerful* having the language to describe your inner experiences is. Especially when it falls outside the norm. I haven’t had the language. I am developing it with time. After lurking a bit I thought this community would be great for continuing my education and help me work out what is confusing for me, still.\n\nIt hit me like a lightning bolt when someone kind pulled me aside and explained that a lot of my dysphoria and self-hatred could be coming from a place of being genderqueer. Now I *know* I am genderqueer but am still feeling conflicted and confused as f\\*\\*k.\n\nMy personal experiences as summarized as follows:\n\nChildhood:\n\n* Did not feel like a girl. Acted boyish and felt deep discomfort and sadness when people would call me a “tomboy.”  \n I didn’t feel like a girl or a boy but felt more comfortable with traditionally masculine/boyish roles (hated pink/dolls, was rough and tumble outdoorsy, etc.). If anyone would have asked me as a kid I would have said I'd was a boy or preferred to be a boy because the gender roles more closely matched there.\n* Was forced to keep hair certain way and dress a certain way by parents because I wasn’t “feminine” enough. It hurt a lot and led to a lot of depression due to never expressing my true self. My true self generally dismissed by family and “friends.”\n* Did not have any physical dysphoria until puberty hit, then started having severe dysphoria and even depersonalization events.\n* Childhood was complicated by numerous childhood traumas (have a diagnosis of cPTSD and PTSD).\n\nAdulthood:\n\n* Sometimes have trouble recognizing my own face in the mirror (from an emotional standpoint). This gets easier when I dress more masculine/androgynous.\n* It feels like I am crossdressing or wearing a costume when I wear a dress, for example.\n* Have fantasies I have male genitalia, but also of female genitals (just not as often).\n* Felt disgust/dysphoria with my female body during sex with previous partners, but it feels good with my current partner to be female in bed (who is AMAB and cis/het).\n* Started taking a low dose of testosterone for an unrelated chronic illness and it felt like something “clicked” inside. It felt great. But I am not sure if that’s because it helped my chronic illness AND/OR the gender stuff. Considering pursuing a dose of T that would not be at transitioning-level but something higher than what I have.\n* Feel discomfort at female pronouns, feel the rightness when gender-neutral pronouns are used. If someone accidentally calls me “sir” it does not feel bad like someone calling me “ma’am.”\n* Got a packer to see how that would feel and it felt good but was not mind-blowing. \n* Gaining weight (I am overweight now) increases by dysphoria in part because it increases my curves.\n* I feel a lot of envy for people who can pass as androgynous more than I do for masculine men.\n* EVERYTHING is complicated by the fact that I also have a severe (potentially life threatening) chronic illness.\n\nSo, what language describes these experiences in YOUR understanding?\n\nI also question whether I could be transgendered but keep landing more on agendered with a propensity to me more comfortable *presenting* on the masculine end of the spectrum (butch agender?).

I ran across the term demiboy (or demiguy) and the definition really resonates with how I feel in my own self, especially [this](https://nonbinary.wiki/wiki/Demigender) specific one ""demiguy can be used to describe someone assigned male at birth who feels but the barest association with that identification, though not a significant enough dissociation to create real physical discomfort or dysphoria."" I feel a bit guilty, not guilty about my feelings of my own gender identity but rather that I only started having these feelings when my fiance shared hers with me. I feel like I'm stealing her [wind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaHisoVg9Ok). I guess what I'm looking for is a bit of validation that I'm not just exploring this so she doesn't feel alone, but that I too have troubles with my gender identity. However, I would like to be totally clear that she has been nothing but supportive of me in looking inward and questioning my gender identity and how I interact with society.

But it feels like just opening my mind to understand my fiance\'s own identity cause a switch to flip inside my own brain to realize that I too may not just be a man in my own head. I ran across the term demiboy (or demiguy) and the definition really resonates with how I feel in my own self, especially [this](https://nonbinary.wiki/wiki/Demigender) specific one ""demiguy can be used to describe someone assigned male at birth who feels but the barest association with that identification, though not a significant enough dissociation to create real physical discomfort or dysphoria."" I feel a bit guilty, not guilty about my feelings of my own gender identity but rather that I only started having these feelings when my fiance shared hers with me. I feel like I\'m stealing her [wind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaHisoVg9Ok). I guess what I\'m looking for is a bit of validation that I\'m not just exploring this so she doesn\'t feel alone, but that I too have troubles with my gender identity.

I'm an AFAB nonbinary lesbian. My gender is something like... Agender, mostly, but I don't mind ""siding with the girls"" in a general sense and never have. I do consider myself to be partially a girl - but not a woman, because that word feels ""too"" gendered. Before you ask, yes, I am an adult. I guess you could call me a demigirl as a quick approximation. I've also described my gender as something like 5% female, 95% nothing (with some slight variance), or simply ""nonbinary lesbian"". For the record, I am 0% male and have never had any doubts about that fact.


When it comes to body dysphoria that is specifically related to gender, I... don't really feel it often? When I do feel it, it's always due to outside influence, and never because I feel like my body is inherently ""wrong"". Basically, I don't mind having breasts and a vulva and periods because of any inherent feeling of wrongness. They feel fine! (Except periods, GOD, fuck periods, delete them forever. But even then, it's just that I find periods annoying, not that I find them dysphoria-inducing in and of themselves.)

I only feel gender dysphoria when I am gendered specifically based on the appearance of my body. If a person sees me and thinks ""oh, that person has breasts and therefore is a woman""? No thank you, I hate that. ""Periods are a symbol of womanhood and femaleness""? Kindly fuck off with that cissexist crap. Amusingly, when I encounter cissexist bullshit in the wild, I tend to suddenly feel a hell of a lot more agender for a bit.

If anything, any ""actual"" dysphoria that I feel (by which I mean, in my case, the feeling that my body in and of itself is *wrong*) is more of a ""whole body"" thing? Sometimes I just don't want to have a body, period. Which is a bit unusual, I'll give you that. It's less about ""being perceived as a woman"" and more about ""this flesh suit is feeling awfully uncomfortable right now.""


That was just an intro. This next part will go into explicit sex discussions, so tread carefully. Be aware that I may possibly be saying transmisogynistic things as well. (I don't *think* I am, but...?)

Anyway... as a lesbian, I am obviously into women, whether they be cis, trans, or nonbinary. Assuming I'm into a particular lady and that lady is into me, I would be totally down to have sex with her, genitals being irrelevant.

But here's the thing: I DO have a genital preference! … For penises. I don't at all dislike or mind vulvas! I think they're just fine. I just think penises are nice, you know? Specifically, PIV sex sounds super appealing in a way that something like, say, strap-on sex doesn't. There's something about how both partners are feeling pleasure directly from the sex act rather than from ""just"" enjoying performing it. Like, I would love for my partner to have strap-on sex with me, but it wouldn't exactly stimulate her fun bits in a direct way, which is what I'm especially interested in: that reciprocity, the one act giving both partners direct stimulation, simultaneously. I hope that makes sense?

Except well, obviously, a vast majority of women who have dicks are trans women. So this puts me in a kind of weird situation where I'm worried I might be fetishizing trans women. Three quick disclaimers:

- I am fully aware that not all trans women have penises.
- I also know that many trans women who do have penises are very uncomfortable with using them for penetrative sex, and I in NO way would pressure them into such a thing.
- I am in an exclusive, happy relationship with a cis woman and have never and will never seek out other women to have sex with without my girlfriend's explicit permission, so at this time there is no chance of me ever actually going out there and courting ladies. We are strictly in ""potential thoughtcrime"" territory.

And here comes the second part that makes me worried I'm fetishizing trans ladies. I would like to have a dick, but only for sex purposes, NOT for anything gender related. As I said, I feel no ""direct"" dysphoria from having a vulva; my genitals are completely and utterly unrelated to my gender. They're just there for peeing and sex, as far as I'm concerned.

My ideal body would be one where I can just... change everything at will? For example, I would love to be able to change the size of my breasts whenever. Going out? Boom, flat chest! Sexy times? Make 'em bigger, baby! And I'd love to have a dick sometimes (while leaving my vulva intact so I'd have both ""sets"" of genitals, sans the testicles) but only for sex as well.

Obviously, this isn't actionable. It's not like I can go get a phalloplasty or surgery to change my breast size on a whim. So I HIGHLY doubt I'll ever do anything to alter my body in any significant way. It's just… something I'd like, you know? Sometimes I get sad that I'll never be able to experience PIV sex from the ""giving"" end. And it's unlikely that I would ever experience it on the ""receiving"" end, either (assuming my current relationship works out, as I certainly hope it will, and assuming we stay exclusive, which we probably will, but who even knows?).


TL;DR &amp; questions: I'm an AFAB nonbinary lesbian who mostly doesn't feel any gender dysphoria without outside influence (AKA cis people being cissexist). I would love to be able to ""put on"" and ""take off"" a penis at will for penetrative sex, and I would love to be on the receiving end of ""direct"" penetrative sex (AKA with a penis, not a strap-on/dildo) from a woman as well.

2019-10-24 00:51:09,dm8udz,0,1,"So, here's my obligatory mention that this is a second account. I just created it five minutes ago because I have questions. Lots and lots of questions. Questions so pressing that I didn't even verify my email because I wanted to get them out. So, let's start the saga.

 So, I started questioning in August of 2019. I read as much as I could about being gender non-conforming, a lot of it was bullshit and very little of it was valid. The problem is, I found an identity for myself among the bullshit I was reading, but I feel like I can't talk about it or do anything to make myself feel good without facing judgment, which is something that on some levels I am cripplingly afraid of. I'm weird like that; I can wear a blinged-out dog collar and not give a shit, but the moment you put me in a situation where I might have to explain to someone that I don't know what I identify as, I start freaking out. The problem is, I can identify with objects and concepts. 

 Now, let me explain what I mean by 'objects and concepts'. What I mean is, I feel like my soul hums in the same frequency as those objects or concepts for a certain amount of time. It sounds weird, and I'm sure there's a better way to phrase it, but I can't think of any. What I feel, I want to express. I want to dress a certain way and act a certain way, but I'm so afraid that I'll be told I'm not supposed to be this way, that I shouldn't be this way, that I don't. I just act like what people think I should act like. 

 One example is my mannerisms. When I'm alone and I identify with, for example, glitter, I'll be walking on the balls of my feet, twirling and dancing if I feel like it, and I like to eat sweet foods and I like shiny things. Maybe I don't want to talk, and that's okay. When I'm alone and I feel like I'm more in tune with the word 'dizzy' I'll be laughing and talking to myself, walking weird on purpose, giggling, drumming my fingers. When I'm with other people, it kind of just becomes 'bleh'. I just act the same, I don't do anything different, and it hurts me. I just want to express myself, but I'm terrified. I don't want to be the one who gets put in the psych ward because I lost my marbles.

 Another problem for me is my pronouns. I prefer to be called she/her pronouns, and I feel guilty about that. I'm AFAB, so I wonder, 'what if this is a phase?', 'what if I'm not actually this?'. I hate it so much, but I don't like being called they or he or any other pronouns, just she/her. 

 That's all I can think of to tell you before I get into my questions. If I think of any more questions, I might make a second post, but for now, here are the questions I can remember:

1. How did you know that you were non-binary?
2. How did you get over the anxiety about expressing yourself in public?

2019-10-27 03:33:26,dno6un,6,5,"Hi all! 

I've been trying to figure myself out a bit recently and find a specific way that I can refer to my gender identity, and I'm wondering if you might be able to help. I've known for a looooong time that I'm not totally cis, and I've existed fairly happily in the kinda gender-fluid middle ground for a while but I've never really been able to actually put on a label on my gender identity. That gender identity is actually quite stable these days, and I'm at the point now where I actually *want* a label, and want to be able to define myself. Here's where y'all come in, hopefully!

Cue the lengthy life story (oh lawd)

I'm in my late 20s. I was born female, but there has been no significant period in my life when I have conformed to the gender identity of 'woman'. I use she/her pronouns because it makes things easier for other people. 

As a child, I had no strong connection to being a 'girl' and was pretty much as un-girly as it was possible to get. My best friends were boys, my favourite games and pastimes were traditionally 'boy stuff' - getting dirty, rough and tumble, boys toys, etc. I didn't connect very well with girls. Classic tomboy. I have a very feminine name, but when I was about 10, I went through a phase of asking people to call me 'Sam'. I gave up because no-one would.

As a teenager, it was much the same. I was sent to an all-girls school but spent my life wishing I could go to my brother's (all-boys) school. I got into rock music, nerdy shit, skateboarding, James Bond movies and martial arts. I had a glorious teenage rebellion, buzzed my hair off, refused to shave my legs even though my school uniform had a compulsory skirt, and moved on to baggy jeans and polo shirts as soon as I went to college. Again, classic tomboy. I realised that I was bisexual, which was a start towards understanding my gender/sexuality, but trans issues and gender identity weren't a 'well known thing' back then (we're talking early-2000s here) so while I went through phases of wondering if I was just the typical butch lesbian, I never thought my gender was up for question. I was a girl, even if I never felt like one.

As an adult, I'm still the same: I work in a traditionally male profession, most of my closest friends are guys, my interests are typically 'blokey', but I present myself differently. I'm quite insecure about my looks and the fact that I'm on the larger side of average size, so if I want to impress, I dress to flatter my (curvy, girly) figure... which ultimately means dressing feminine. I wear what looks best on me. Dresses and skirts and heels are still Not My Thing but I usually tend towards 'fierce and feminine' - stompy masculine boots paired with tight jeans and feminine low cut tops. My hair is long, and if I'm dressing to impress, I wear a lot of makeup (because dammit, I'm good at it, haha). Why? Because it's flattering. Because it looks good. Because I have cheekbones and hips and boobs and a decent arse and that's how I can best make that figure look good. 

Yet I am constantly aware that my outward appearance does not represent the 'me' that's in my head. It's like putting on a costume. The 'girl' costume looks better on me than the 'boy' one, so I always go for it. It's easier. It's the path of least resistance. It's a compromise, one which is designed to make the most of what I've got. If I'm not dressing to impress, I'll have my hair perpetually tied up, no makeup, comfortable clothes, practical boots, don't give a shit.

I work out hard and train with weights to build muscle: that's also a compromise. I have always struggled with shifting the extra weight, so if my figure's going to be curvy and feminine, I also want it to be strong and fierce.

If I had a slimmer, more androgynous figure, I'd buzz my hair off again in a heartbeat. I'd rarely wear makeup (because tbh it's a hassle). I'd probably return to the baggy jeans and polo shirts of my teenage years. I'd wear a suit to a wedding instead of a dress. I'd eliminate most traces of femininity from my looks, and I'd be comfortable with that. 

Despite the way I present myself these days, I don't feel like a woman. Ever since I was a kid, my heroes, the famous figures or fictional characters who I've looked at and gone ""damn, I want to be them/look like them""... have always been men. All my closest friends have always been men. I've always felt like, and wanted to be considered as, 'one of the guys'. I know, deep down, through a lot of introspection, that my identity is way way closer to the male end of the spectrum than the female end, yet I'm stuck in this weird situation where I'm presenting as (quite strongly) feminine because that's what looks good on me.

That said, I'm pretty certain I'm not legitimately trans? I have no dysphoria with regards to my body other than its overall size: my boobs are small and easy to ignore, I recognise my arse and hips as an 'attractive feature', and although I would absolutely not mind if I woke up tomorrow with a penis and a flat chest instead, I'm fine with my body the way it is - even if I do wish it was a little smaller so I could convincingly dress it in more masculine clothes and present as more androgynous. If I had the option of transitioning, I don't think I'd take it: I don't want to lose the possibility of presenting as female (like I said earlier, it's nice to play dress-up), but I do wish my shape was less overtly feminine. And I would very, very much love to go by an androgynous or male name, even it's totally out of step with the way I present myself. *Especially* if it's totally out of step with the way I present myself. I've picked one, and I'd love to use it. The concept of outwardly presenting female but using man's name is ridiculously attractive to me, for some reason.

So yes. That's me. Boy brain, girl body, presents as a girl, would actually rather be somewhere firmly and un-distinguishably in the middle. What on earth do I call that? Can I have a label please?

Of course I could ask my partner, and I have to an extent (but I worry about being too confrontational as these are all based on comments he\'s made in the heat of the moment). Perhaps, I just want to know how common this is for people, namely submissive folk? I would like to be open minded and would really like to hear other perspectives.

2019-10-28 20:43:54,dof149,4,28,"This is slightly modified from a post I made to r/asktransgender a bit over a week ago, which was the update to an older post. I've been pondering the possibility of being trans for a while, and capital-Q questioning for just a month and change. 

For backstory, I'm 16, AFAB, and have recently been starting to think I might not be cis. I got a few comments on my original post saying my symptoms didn't sound like binary dysphoria, and I agree. If I'm not cis, then I'm likely not completely a binary trans boy.

My main problem right now is that my feelings fluctuate so often that I'm not sure whether they're Trans Things or regular insecurities. My gender feelings will fluctuate anywhere from every few days to multiple times a day. Sometimes I have days like today where I'm longing to have all the masc traits I'm about to list, and then days where I'm not really bothered by it and I'm fine being a (not very femme) female. So my biggest fear is coming to some sort of conclusion, cis or otherwise, and then being wrong about it.

When I'm feeling masc, I don't want to pass completely as male, and I wouldn't want to be a straight guy (I only like girls) but I'd like to be androgynous/male-leaning. I don't feel like I fit in well with large communities of girls or guys. I really want a lower voice and I want a male figure with broader shoulders, flat chest, a straighter body- but I don't want a penis, or tons facial hair. (Maybe a bit is fine.) If my egg cracked, I'd be interested in going on T, just probably a lower dose. Bottom line is, I'd like for people to not be able to immediately tell my gender, but upon guessing, go with male.

As I mentioned earlier, this is over-complicated by not knowing whether my feelings are trans things or regular insecurities. For example, am I more or less okay with my body (depending on the day) because I'm fine with it being a female body, or because it's already very androgynous and straight? I feel like if I had a more feminine figure, I'd be very uncomfortable with it, but in this middle zone, I never know whether I feel body dysphoria, or to what extent.

Pronouns are weird for me because personally, even though I don't feel binary, they/them doesn't feel right on me. When I'm feeling masc, I like the pronouns he/him, although the prospect is new and scary. On the other hand, I don't have strong feelings against she/her, just put off a little bit, like it's a grammar error. I feel weird about she/her, but I'm not sure if I actually dislike it or if I'm overthinking and making myself think I don't like it so I can have more """"evidence"""". *(Sounds sketch, but more on that later.)* And he/him is the same way but in the other direction. When I picture one of my friends calling me ""he"", I like it, but I can't tell if that's euphoria or nerves from trying out something new.

*(This is the ""more on that later"" part.)* If I had a definitive realization that I'm trans, it'd be terrifying, but it'd also be relieving in a way because it'd feel like I have an explanation for why I'm like this. So I'm worried that my internal bias is making me reconsider things I feel okay with so I can have more """"evidence"""" for being trans. 

**\[Possible TW for what I think is internalized transphobia- my insecurities about enbies and the dating pool. Sorry, I really don't know how to word this so it sounds good. You don't have to read it.\]**

&gt;!If I transitioned, years down the road, I feel like my dating prospects would be significantly decreased. How would I find a girl who wants to date an enby? I don't think I'd be a binary trans dude, and I wouldn't be interested in bottom surgery, so how many girls would be interested in that? And I guess this next part is even more TMI and incorrect, but I wouldn't want to take on the dominant/traditionally male role in a relationship. Sorry again, I know this is probably incorrect and all kinds of offensive, but I worry about it.!&lt;

Here are some other eggy moments I've compiled.

* Browse r/ftm, r/egg_irl, and r/asktransgender regularly
* Watch FTM transition compilation YouTube videos regularly, but not MTF ones
* Research boy names A LOT, and always have a favorite on hand that I think fits me
* Daydream about what it’d be like to be trans, and to live as a boy
* Daydream about getting a foster kid or younger sibling who comes out as a trans boy, and helping them come out/transition
* Watched that entire video on nb top surgery
* Draw myself as a guy/androgynous a lot, and make guy/androgynous avatars a lot
* Venture into men’s sections a lot
* Before I was questioning, I tried on girls' Nike Pros, and got the S instead of XS because they looked more like boxers
* Wish I could be flat chested/shirtless at pool
* Got SUPER excited about reading this one book where neither protagonists is referred to with any gender markers or pronouns, then VERY disappointed when it was boring
* Bought a memoir by a *binary* trans man to figure out if I was trans, then when I didn’t fully relate to his experiences, completely discarded the idea of being trans until I came back to it a week later
* Had a freak-out in a department store dressing room trying on a homecoming dress because my (A-cup) chest looked too big and I looked too feminine, then had to take the dress off and calm myself down by thinking about transitioning, even though I hadn't even started questioning yet

Could I get some advice? Do these signs point to me being cis, insecure, and just gnc/androgynous, or maybe trans/nb?

One last thing- I'm still trying to figure out how I feel about pronouns. Even if you don't have any advice to give, could you maybe humor me by writing a sentence or so addressing me in the comments? You can use the pronouns she/her if your birthday falls in Jan-April, they/them if it falls in May-Aug, and he/him if it falls in Sept-Dec. You can also use the name Jack.

It feels like she's made it her mission to talk me out of surgery/hormone therapy, because whenever it comes up, she challenges me to the point where I just freeze up and start depersonalising/dissociating.

So then she concluded that I\'m transitioning for other people, because my acceptance should come from within?! Why do I feel so hurt by this? I really feel like shit now for wanting a more masculine body and a flat chest, because I can\'t legitimise it properly.\n\nIt feels like she\'s made it her mission to talk me out of surgery/hormone therapy, because whenever it comes up, she challenges me to the point where I just freeze up and start depersonalising/dissociating.\n\nI guess I needed to vent; writing it all down helped a bit already. Thanks for reading, and feel free to leave any advice in a comment.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Everybody is okay with my transition, except for my therapist?!', 'created': 1572572392.0}"

I'll open up the AMA early, so everyone can start posting their questions ahead of time.
