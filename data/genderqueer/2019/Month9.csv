So basically my friend who is the greatest badass person of all time and is just genuinely super amazing and whom I don't know what I'd do without. 

Told me they are 'gender fluid'. Now this seemed like a real big thing to say and I was so happy they felt they could tell me! I was so supportive and listened and honestly told a slight lie about how I understood (which in the sense that I understood their feelings just not the actual concept) cause I did ask them this but even after a few different ways of explaining. I still don't get it. 

 I want to be 100% supportive and obvs it wouldn't change anything in our friendship. You do you- is our life motto basically. 

But I am very confused. 

I understand queer, different sexualities (I'm asexual) and I understand trans as best as a non trans woman can. But gender fluid is something I just can't quite ... Get? 

The way my friend explains- some days they 'feel' more feminine and dress that way and other days it's more masculine. They don't feel like they are one gender. 

Which just confused me more tbh.

From my perspective.

I'm a woman. I 100% know that and am happy with that. 

I'm not 'traditionally feminine'. I wear docs, I hate skirts. I don't wear makeup and I've had both long and short hair styles. 

On the whole I'm not 'feminine'. Yet I know I am still a woman and wouldn't want to change that.

So I really don't get gender fluid.

My friend (and from other people online) say it's about 'feeling' like a gender and clothes can be a big part of expressing that...  but gender isn't about your clothes or 'stereotypes'?... Does my wearing doc boots and jeans make me a guy? Then there's people who say 'don't be stereotypical'

 And if people 'felt' like a man or woman wouldn't that make you trans? 

If you were a guy wanting to wear traditional 'female' clothes like dresses/or females wearing traditional 'male' clothes like tuxedos wouldn't that just make people 'crossdressers' in a formal sense of the word. Like I've been to weddings in pant suits before and no one has 'misgendered me'.  

I painted a girls nails in an after-school club for her and a boy wanted his done- he loved them, but he still knew he was a boy and said so to his mum when she picked him up lol...  

So yeah basically gender fluid is confusing to me and as said, this isn't going to change a friendship. I just want to try and be a good friend and educate myself.

I’m a girl (20F) on the boyish side, but not totally butch. I’m pretty content with being female, I love having a female appearance and I enjoy women’s style and fashion. But I also enjoy incorporating men’s fashion (men’s shirts, jackets, etc.) and having short hair.

I often think about how nice it would be to have a handsome, masculine man as a partner, but then I realized that *damn*, but wouldn’t it be awesome to *be* that handsome boy? You’d probably ask, “but how about being an attractive woman instead?”. Well, yeah that would probably be cool, but I’m not really enticed by the idea of being a beautiful woman. But being a handsome boy? Fuck yeah, that would be sick. I would be so much more confident and outgoing if I were a boy. It would fit my personality more, and I bet I’d be more likeable as a handsome dude than a pretty girl. Boy clothes are so cool and I would love to be tall and well-built. I also feel complemented when girls are attracted to my boyish attributes (like my “traditionally masculine” hobbies, or my boyish-femme fashion). I also like to switch the ways I speak and move depending on how I feel, from feminine to masculine and vice versa.

I have no desire to transition, though. I don’t feel like I was born the wrong sex, and I would still miss being a girl if I “magically” transformed into a biological boy. Maybe this is a gender expression thing? Is this what they call ‘fluidity’? I don’t want to make myself appear completely as a boy, though, in my current female state. I’m still happy with my boyish-femme fashion. But if I had magic biological sex-swapping powers I’d have a lot of fun with it.

And come to think of it, even when I was a little girl, I gravitated towards the male “appearance”. I wanted to be like my older brothers, so I copied their clothes and I even wanted to wear the same school uniform. Preschool me wanted to pee standing up and wanted to have manly muscles (lol). But I still felt like a girl.

Maybe this is because I’m constantly surrounded by men (I have more male family and friends), more so than women.

Hey friends, 

So just like most of these entries start; for as long as I can remember I have always been presenting masculine, have always been uncomfortable with my chest and I have always done everything in my power to make that area look as unnoticeable and flat as possible. 

I wont go into detail about it to much, but this want for a flatter chest developed into a pretty bad eating disorder, that to be fair worked in reducing that area. 

At the point where my ED was hospital level bad, was also a point that I had never felt better in my life about my chest dysphoria (obviously because of the weight loss there). 

Over the last year I have worked on this and can now say Im very nearly recovered - the issue being that I have a larger chest now and this is devastating, my dysphoria is worse then is has ever been and is the reason it was so hard to let go of my ED. Like at a point of wearing 2 binders (I realise this is very fucking bad) 

Anyway, during all this time, I met an amazing boy (21/S/M) who does his absolute best to be as understanding as he can on a daily basis. But its strange though because I never feel dysphoric during sex... and if anything, I enjoy that area during this time.  I know boobs are like a big thing for him an I wouldnt want to jeopardise our relationship because I want top surgery, but crying all the time because im not okay with my chest isnt sustainable either. 

Does anyone else with dysphoria experience this? How can something affecting me so seriously every second of my life, something that takes over a huge portion of  my thoughts just not be a problem in a time where I am exposed the most? 

So I just don't really know what to do. On one hand: I work towards getting top surgery but ruin the relationship I have or on the other hand; suffer with this everyday of my life. But because this isnt an issue during sex and is just day to day.... Maybe breast reduction is an option?

Lately I’ve been reading and watching some stuff about queer theory just from general interest, and it’s made me question a lot about how I perceive my own gender. In hindsight, I think I’ve been questioning my gender for a while now, for a number of reasons:  

* When I was younger I always knew I was different from other boys my age, and chalked this up to the fact that I was gay. But when I was at university I still felt like there was something internal or intrapsychic separating me from the other gay guys. 
* I have never been comfortable talking to my family about my identity as a gay man. My parents know, and they’re very liberal and accepting (or, well-meaning), but it still makes me uncomfortable bringing it up, like it’s an over-simplification. I haven’t told my extended family. I used to think I had some internal conflict over gay stereotypes, like I was scared they’d make incorrect or degrading assumptions about me based on my sexuality, but I think there’s more to it in a way I can’t really describe. 
* This is a difficult one to put into words, but I have never felt like gendered clothes of any kind really ‘express what I feel.’  I don’t think I’d be comfortable wearing ‘women’s clothes’ but I currently just wear variations of a very neutral ‘jeans and a plain t shirt’ style. It still feels like I’m trying to dress ‘as’ something else, but anything more overtly masculine or feminine also doesn’t feel like me. 

So my question is, given that I’ve reached a point of questioning my identity, what could be the best way of reaching an answer? I’m trying not to think in terms of “am I non-binary or am I cisgender,” because that’s another binary choice so maybe defeats the point, but I’d like to have a stronger grasp on how I ultimately identify.

I'm going to keep reading up on queer theory (I ordered a textbook online), and I think meditating might be useful? Also I've been going to therapy for about 3 weeks and I found out last week that my therapist is non-binary, but there are other things I need to address in therapy before I get to this so I think it'll be a while before I start to work on it with them.

Born male.

I've always thought I want to be a girl, from when I started school, all the way upto the last few months where I've been constantly questioning my thought process.

Prior to learning how the ""what's in your pants"" works between girls and boys I used to try and cut my boy parts off (I didn't succeed, it hurt too much).

I'm 100% obsessed with women's fashion and some men's fashion, love getting dressed up very feminine but can't see myself from the shoulders up ever being female. I don't see myself as cis male, or a crossdresser. I don't like gender roles created by society where men should only do manly things and women only do girly things.

I love mashing up stereotypical male and female fashion, I'd love to learn how to use make-up.

Some days I feel more male, some days more female.

This all might seem very trans-like, but I'm ok with having male genitalia, I only like women sexually (not that, that matters), I don't want to transition to female, I'm still jealous of women, but I just want to be me.

Not that I need a label, I just need to know that I'm not alone in this, but does this appear genderqueer to you?

2019-09-11 14:58:10,d2rgee,11,29,"Hey, I'm afab, been questioning my gender for 3 years. I'm in my 30s and married and have kids.

When I first started questioning I just felt that I wanted facial hair occasionally. Then as i started questioning more, i realized it was more than that. I want to have a flat chest, a hairy body and facial hair.

When I first started questioning it was like 30% of the time I wanted these things and 70% I didnt. As the years have gone on, it's pretty much 80% of the time I want to have a male body and only 20% I dont. But no matter what my chest bothers me and always has. Even before it was a question of gender.

I thought maybe I was transmasculine. As I dont really have a preferred pronoun and my name doesnt bother me but it's not a super feminine name anyway. 

Then I was worried maybe I just want something I cant have. But I'm pretty sure that's not the case as I really enjoy my body hair that I can grow. I cant remember the last time I bought a razor. I shave my legs maybe once or twice in the summer just to keep people from saying anything and I shave my armpits in the summer. Last winter is the first time I actually let my armpit hair grow and it was amazing. I'm thinking about letting it grow again. 

So basically I want a male body and feel as though I'd be much happier in a male body but I dont really care about pronouns, names and the social aspect. Truthfully transitioning is only really not happening because I dont want to deal with the social outfall of transitioning. I know I'd feel better with a flat chest and hairy body, but I'm unsure that it's worth the social problems that come along with it especially for my kids and husband.

2019-09-12 17:54:05,d3bna2,0,1,"Hi there. I'm not sure if this is strictly queer-related, per se,  but it kind of is, and I figured the people here would have more experience in these matters and could give me some advice about this. For the record, I don't really think I'm queer - I'm hetero, I identify with the gender I was born as and have never really felt that I'm a girl or want to be a girl, beyond mild curiousity about what it would feel like, except that sometimes I've envied the concept of feminine beauty and fashion and am very interested in embodying that, if only for a little while. TL;DR I don't want to be a woman or even look like a woman, but I do want to be *pretty* and confident if that makes any sense. This just mainly manifests itself in one aspect of fashion in particular -I'm not asking for psychoanalysis, just a little bit of fashion advice on what is and is not considered appropriate. (That said, I have basically zero understanding of the vast range of identities that fall under the umbrella of ""queer"", so I can't say for certain there's no label that applies to me, just that I don't know of any and haven't really gone looking.)

Anyway, more to the point: I've always been kind of obsessed with women's gymnastics, I always thought it was one of the coolest things  ever that I wished I could do. The vast majority of the times I've randomly pondered ""wouldn't it be cool to be like a girl, not all the time, but just for a little while"" is when I'm watching the amazing artistry of these incredible, graceful athletes. 

Although I never got a  chance to do it as a kid, recently I've been supremely lucky to get a  chance to start taking private gymnastics lessons at my local YMCA as an  adult beginner. I've only had a couple sessions with my instructor so  far, but I'm really liking it - it's so hard, but feels so rewarding! -  and want to keep going with it. I have a great teacher, who's very nice,  understanding, and helpful. She's been teaching me mostly the basics on  the floor, but also some balance beam work. Best of all, I've always  worn a (girl's) leotard to class so far (albeit with shorts over top)  and she hasn't said a word about it, nor said anything about the fact  that (at least on the beam, I don't know that much about floor) I'm  technically learning the girl's stuff. I definitely appreciate how lucky  I am to have this opportunity to fulfill one of my feminine sort-of dreams.

With that in mind...do you guys suppose there's any way I could convince her to let me wear *just*  the leotard to class, without shorts over top? Moreover, is it inappropriate for me to even think about wanting to do that? (Be honest with me if so.) I don't wear makeup, tie my hair back, or do anything particularly feminine for class other than  wearing a girl's leo, but I feel like it would help me feel that much more confident and proud in my body, to run around in just a leotard without shorts, my legs free and  uncovered, like the girls I was so jealous of as a kid did. I'm not a  particularly feminine or masculine guy, but when I try on my leotards in  my room I feel cute and confident in my body for once, and I would like  to enjoy that feeling during practice as well. When I'm in just my leotards, I feel confident and flexible like my legs and arms are  completely free to move and run and flip and do anything I want - I feel beautiful almost, even though I know I don't look remotely feminine in  one. It helps me get close to that ideal of *beauty* in the art and *elegance* in the sport that I'm lacking in pretty much everywhere else in my life (lol.) 

I guess what I'm saying is that there aren't that many things in my wardrobe where I can put them on and think ""Wow, I actually feel almost beautiful"" and ""I like the way my body looks in this"", and this is one of them. I just hope that my desire to feel proud of how my body looks isn't likely to conflict with the rules that my gym has established for the safety and comfort of all the *other* athletes there, who have as much right to feel relaxed and confident as I do.

I do understand the  importance of modesty and why male gymnasts usually wear shorts over  top, and I appreciate how rare an opportunity this is for me, so I'm  hesitant to push my luck by asking about this, but I'd really like to  find a way to do it somehow. (For one thing, although she has no problem  teaching me balance beam, I'm not even sure my instructor *knows*  I'm wearing girl's leotards, since the ones I've worn so far have all  been solid-colored with no fancy designs and fairly gender-neutral  colors.) Am I pushing my luck too much by thinking about this, and would  I, by pursuing this, be endangering a rare opportunity most people (who like gender non-traditional fashion) don't get?

I don't  imagine it would be too difficult to get a gaff or athletic supporter  (or whatever is the best thing to wear underneath for the support that a  girl's leo itself does not provide) FYI I am a college student if that  makes any difference.

TL;DR I am a  male gymnast who wears girls leos and a pair of shorts to class with no  resistance or complaints from anyone. But I would love to be able to  lose the shorts and practice in just a leotard.

2019-09-15 01:29:13,d4e3wp,0,1,"My partner and I have been dating for over 4 and a half years. Up until recently, I referred to my partner as my boyfriend, as they had only presented themselves as a man and identified themselves as a man to me for our entire relationship.

I am a bisexual woman, but I am not pansexual. I have a type for both men and women. When I am into women, they are very stereotypically feminine, assertive, and know what they want. I like women with long hair, a curvaceous figure, and who dress very feminine. I like makeup and cute outfits and girly interests. 

When I am into a man, I prefer very masculine hairy men with strong shoulders and jawlines, and deep voices.

I really do not want to offend this community in anyway as I am trying to learn and hopefully find a way to change the way I feel. But as of right now I am not attracted to gender fluid individuals, masculine women, or feminine men. I don’t know why and I can’t help it. It’s just the way I’ve always been. I tried dating an androgynous presenting person a few years back and was entirely put off even though they were nice looking and had a good personality. It’s mental for me. 

My partner is the love of my life. I have never loved someone as much as them. I always saw myself marrying them. I’ve always been incredibly attracted to them as a man and loved the masculine parts of them. It’s what attracted me in the first place! I would not have initially been interested in them if they were presenting as more feminine.

Recently, over a lot of tears, my partner confessed they do not feel like a man. They didn’t like when I call them handsome, refer to them as my boyfriend, or tell them something looks manly on them. This really threw me for a loop because we have had many talks about how they felt insecure and wanted to be even more masculine so they started working out all the time and wanting to grow a beard and other things. I didn’t really care either way as I was attracted to them the way they were and did view them as manly, but I would reassure them that they were plenty masculine enough anyway.

Now that they have come out to me about this, it all makes sense and that phase was likely the result of trying to right some gender dysphoria. 

As they were telling me about how they were feeling, they cried and cried, worried I would lose attraction to them. They talked about how they wanted me to embrace their “feminine energy” sexually and I just didn’t know how to respond because they couldn’t really give me an example of what that meant.

I’m into power play and like being the sub or dom, but it’s never been about gender for me and more about power. It’s the same for me regardless of being with a man or a woman. It’s not like I ever emphasize the fact they have a male body in bed. I never expect them to be the one in control, etc.

They also said they were unhappy with their appearance and wanted to present more feminine and be viewed as pretty. I already think they are pretty but I am reallllly not attracted to this idea. If they were to grow their hair out, wear makeup, or wear female clothes, I think I would really lose attraction.

I’m really struggling here. I don’t want to be judgmental and prejudiced. I am really trying to understand where they are coming from and have been using exclusively gender neutral pronouns and terms to refer to them while we work through this, but I can just feel my mental attraction fading.

They have clarified they are not transgender and do not wish to be female, but just do not feel like a man and wish to play with gender barriers. 

I’ve been crying over this a lot lately because I love them so much. I love them so much that I want to work through this desperately and just force myself to feel the same attraction for them but I just can’t. 

What is wrong with me? Why do I feel this way? 
I don’t want them to be unhappy and experience this dysphoria. I want them to be true to themselves and to be confident because they deserve that. They’re the best person I know but I just feel like I lost my boyfriend when they became my partner.  I just can’t force the physical attraction when they are feminine.

Please help me. How do I come to terms with this? They are the love of my life and I’m just so confused and feel like I’m preventing their growth and like I’m the shittiest girlfriend in the world.

I’m really sorry if I offended anybody.

This also may be all over the place, im tired at the moment.

I'm in highschool and also AFAB, and i currently just say im a girl to people i greet. throughout my entire life ive never really liked saying that either. I dont think im cis but i dont really know much about being trans or any other identity. Maybe im just a cis person whos thinking too hard about things, who knows. I cant discuss this with my family since they are really lgbtphobic and whatever i do decide it will be a struggle to not fit into their gender roles they make me strictly follow by.

growing up i never liked conventionally girly things, ive never really made friends with girls, i dont even like to wear womans clothing. I dont really hate my body, its not very feminine (im very flat) but im too skinny to be considered masculine. Though, i just hate when people call me a girl or recognize me as a woman. I vaguely remember telling a classmate in early grade school that i might end up being a 'transgender person', and cut all of my hair off (something ive wanted to do since i was 5) When people call me non feminine pronouns, 'him' or 'they', or refer to me by my nickname (which isnt as feminine as my real name) it just feels right.

Heres the confusing part to this entire situation, in my head when i picture myself, i almost always see myself as someone who is genderless or maybe as male. Online ive always just passed as a dude. I dont really want to transition to male, i dont really like the idea of being a man, but i dont want to be a woman either, and putting labels on this is just as confusing as deciding what my feelings and thoughts mean in the first place.

For example,

u (او) is used for both ""he"" and ""she"" (common gender);

ishān (ایشان) is used for both ""he"" and ""she"" but in formal contexts and writing;

ān (آن) is used for ""it"" (neuter gender).

In Persian, the same nouns are used for male and female professionals. For example: bāzigar (بازیگر) means both actor and actress. Pish khedmat(پیشخدمت) might mean waiter or waitress. The noun suffix -ash (اَش) serves either as a possessive adjective or an object pronoun for both males and females as well as things, situations, etc. For example,
ketābash (کتابش) means ""her/his book"";pāyash (پایش) means ""/her/his/its leg"";

U labash rā busid (او لبش را بوسید) means ""He kissed her lips"" or ""she kissed his lips"" or ""he kissed his lips"" or ""she kissed her lips"" or even ""a person of indeterminate gender kissed another person of indeterminate gender's lips."" If we consider -ash as an object pronoun we can translate the sentence as ""she/he kissed her/him on the lips"".

I've been struggling with my gender identity for quite a while now (at least 5 years), and I think I've reached the satisfying conclusion that I might be genderqueer. I identify as both male and female, though I tend to present femme almost all the time (I'm AFAB as well). I use exclusively male pronouns when talking about myself, but I don't mind other people using she/her, though I literally melt when I'm called a *boy*. 

I'm so scared of what others will think, though... first and foremost my SO, a cis straight man who wasn't convinced non-binary was even a thing until we had an argument about it and now he sides with me when someone misgenders nb people. 

I'm scared of not being taken seriously in a professional setting (I'm majoring in translation and interpreting). 

As someone who is bi, I already know what it's like to be in the closet about who you are (ie: none of my in-laws, who I live with, know I'm not straight) and often told to ""pick a side"". I feel like life is playing some kind of joke on me rn. 

Does anyone here relate to this feeling? I feel so alone in this. I wish I could just be myself with no repercussions... It's not even just social pressure, I loathe my body.

\[I'd love to hear about your story, thank you very much in advance if you decide to share\]

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my experience if you're interested:

I've been questioning my gender for over a yearHow and when did you ""figure out"" your gender? How and when did you ""know""?

 now and I've still not quite figured it out.

I've been thinking I might be ***non binary*** and ***genderfluid***, but I'm still not sure.

* I'm ***AFAB*** and I don't feel legitimate as I feel like my gender *fluctuates*, I happen to feel ""*woman-ly*\*\*""\*\* and *nb*, or something else than ""*woman*"" as in a ""*gray area*"". (I had a point where I thought I was *bigender*, more specifically *bigirl*, but saying *bigirl* gives the girl part too much attention, which doesn't feel as right as it used to)
* I would not feel comfortable with ""he/him"" pronouns. But I do with ***she/her*** and ***they/them*** pronouns. Although, I really dislike to be referred to ""madam"" or such things.
* I deeply reject social gender norms as well, but I don't know if it's because I'm deconstructing myself from social constructs or because it's on a personal level.
* The same goes for the clothes I wear, I like clothes from the men's and women's section. I sometimes like to wear one more than the other, it fluctuates.
* I also like to have body hair and not shave them which makes me feel good and less ""woman-ly"" (as in the social stereotype and norm for women), and more me? like ""damn I don't look \*stereotypically or typically to disgusting social norms\* like a woman""
* I used to ""defend"" nb people, and it'd hurt when they would get misgendered or invalidated by others. However, now it hurts me on an another level. Personal level.

When I talk about it I'm feeling very good and authentic. Then when I don't talk about it, I feel like it's all a lie? and I feel weird? **Especially** after talking about it with close-friends as they don't know much about it all...

&amp;#x200B;

I'm genderqueer, I'm queer. I'll say that so I don't have to put any gender or anything on it whilst figuring it all out. Talking about it now, I'd say I'm NB. Ugh.

Someone accidentally referring to me as ""them"", reading a book with a non-binary character, following nb people on internet, talking about it to a couple of people around me, and Sam Smith coming out as non binary pushed me to talk about trying they/them pronouns to my close friends. And questioning my gender even more.

&amp;#x200B;

So if gender isn't about those things what is it about? What else is there?

And then I saw someone say something like ""I realized I was agender when I asked myself how trans people 'just knew' what gender they were.""

Which is something I've also wondered. I don't think I feel female, or male, or anything, but how would I know, if I've always felt this way? (Do cis people actually feel like they're their gender? What does being female feel like, and how does male feel differently?)

Hi, I'm a 27yo AFAB person, been identifying as genderfluid for the past 6 years or so. In these years, I've sometimes wondered whether I was maybe a man instead of a genderfluid person, but then usually concluded that that was probably not the case, for whatever reason. I usually dress rather femme, disphoria goes up and down but lately the need to not have a chest has been high so I finally bit the bullet and ordered a binder. It arrived yesterday, and it fits great. Yay!

Now, I'm bi/pan and polyamorous, so been dating a few people and they're all super supportive. There's a cis guy I've been seeing for about 6 months, and he's not great in expressing his thoughts and feelings so he didn't say much about it, I think he's probably adjusting to things as he's only dated cis women before. We had a nice evening and then got frisky, and though I usually never have an issue with this, suddenly penetration felt weird. Even with fingers. The physical sensation was nice, but somehow it felt... off. Even though before yesterday, I've absolutely loved it most of the time.

Society got into my brain too, it told me that I had to be feminine, show my curves, wear a cleavage, long hair, makeup, etc. Y'all know the deal. And so I did. Until this summer (I'm 24), after a very bad relationship and breakup, I realized that my appearance has never been my own. With the years, I've tried to go back to the tomboyish look, but only enough so that I wouldn't be judged. 

Here's where the gender thing comes in. My country is pretty traditional, I only learned what non-binary meant a couple years ago. And I've always questioned my relationship with gender, but never consciously till now. Until this summer, I just felt bad because even though I didn't want to be a boy, I felt as though the ""girl"" label wasn't right. And people told me that I'm just more masculine, tomboy, or a lesbian (?), etc. 

Regarding my body, I always wore my brother's clothes, and boy's swimsuits when I was a child (I live in a pretty hot country), and it took a lot of convincing for me to wear a bikini, and even then, I refused to wear the top part of it. When I went into puberty and had to wear the top, it was very dramatic for me. Bras were also very dramatic, so I started wearing sport bras that made me flatter. And still nowadays, I tend to go for a flatter look. I also tend to like pants that make me less ""curvy"". 

And the most dramatic part of it all, and where all of this comes from: my hair. I've worn it very long for years, but I always wear it up because I don't like it. I've been wanting to cut it for years, but I'm always told that ""it's too pretty"" or that I'll lose my sex appeal or whatever. And this summer, I kind of decided to do it (still haven't done it yet, I'm too afraid in case I actually lose the one thing that's pretty about me). 

Basically all this time I've been dressing femme for other people, wearing long hair for other people, acting more ladylike for other people. And for years I've thought that this ""girl"" label doesn't fit, but I don't feel non-binary enough, as if I don't fit the criteria. As if I'm just a masculine girl who doesn't like traditional gender roles, and that's it. Because even though I don't like the girl label, I don't really have dysphoria (apart from wanting to be flatter and less curvy, but I solve that with clothes and not looking at myself in the mirror that much), I don't care about she/her pronouns, I'm okay with my private parts... I basically feel like I'm underestimating people who are actually trans or actually enby.

2019-09-20 04:40:57,d6pucc,2,6,"Ok, so growing up, I never felt ""girly"".  I'm older than most on here, and I grew up during a different time (Gen X, not Gen Z).  I grew up around a lot of LGBT people because my mom worked with a lot of them, and a good majority were her friends.  My strongest male role models were the couple that lived downstairs from us when I was a little girl.  Dan and Dale.  Dale was aloof, but caring.  Dan, on the other hand was wonderful.  He'd sit with me and answer my ten thousand questions, he let me watch movies, taught me how to ride a bike, and when they were outside, I got to play with their dogs and spend time with them.  I felt the loss very deeply when they both died of AIDS.  I still miss them all these years later.  

&amp;#x200B;

My mom didn't figure out she was asexual until she was in her sixties.  All she knew was that she did not enjoy sex.  She enjoyed the romance though.  She was never feminine when I was growing up, and I think I can count on one hand the number of times I ever saw her wear a skirt or dress.  She just wasn't comfortable in them.  So these were my role models growing up.  I have an aunt that was feminine, and she still is, though now she prefers her tee shirts and pajama pants when she's at home, and tee shirts and jeans when she goes out.  Long gone are the tight tank tops, flowy dresses, etc.  

&amp;#x200B;

Growing up with these people influencing me, and living in a time where if you were a girl, you were supposed to act like one and dress like one, but I hated dresses.  They made me uncomfortable.  I had the long hair that came down past my butt because my mom wanted me to grow it out.  She loved my hair, so I wasn't allowed to cut it until I was ten and we moved from the city to the suburbs.  Basically it was the attitude of ""New school, New you"", and I took advantage.  I cut my hair above my shoulders, and it was so freeing.  My first day of school, I wore a matching sweatsuit.  It was light blue and my gym shoes.  I felt comfortable for the first time.  

&amp;#x200B;

As I grew up, I fluctuated.  My hair was short in 8th grade so I could play basketball (I was on the team.  Preferred that to cheerleading, though I did try out for that because my best friend did.  She didn't want to do it alone.  That made me so uncomfortable.  I didn't get on the squad and I was glad. Neither did she.  I was always very sports-oriented.  I took ballet when I was really little because my mom wanted me to, but as soon as I hit elementary school, sports were all I wanted to do.  I ran cross country, played soccer, did gymnastics, and then later played basketball.  It was confusing for me because I would play Barbies, and I enjoyed it, but I  played cops and robbers with the neighborhood boys too.  As far as clothing went, I wore whatever made me comfortable.  One day might be jeans and a tee-shirt, the next a tee shirt and jean skirt.  I learned as I got older to wear what I was comfortable in.  

&amp;#x200B;

In high school, while the girls were all experimenting with makeup and trying to look as pretty as possible, I was busy playing D&amp;D with the guys or playing Blackjack in homeroom with my least feminine friend (who is now my best friend.   
 She wasn't back then).  To fit in I played with styling my hair a bit but even though I had grown it out again, 99.99% of the time it was pulled back in a ponytail and I was cursing it because ponytails gave me headaches.  Then came graduation.   
 I went off to college while my female friends all started getting pregnant and having babies.  I did a year of college, then shocked all the girls by joining the army.  I felt good in the military.  I was wearing the same thing as the guys, but as the girls too, and it felt good, it felt right.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'd had crushes on boys way back in kindergarten (his name was Alex), but then I started having crushes on girls too.  My first celebrity crush was Claire Danes.  I thought she was so pretty, and I wanted to kiss her.  At that age, no one told me you could like boys AND girls.  I didn't learn that until much later.  I never once heard the term bisexual as a child.  I've always been very linear with my thinking, so if I wasn't told it was a possibility, I didn't even consider it.  And no one talked about it, so I didn't know it was a thing.  So it confused me that I liked both.  It was gay, lesbian, or straight.  That was it.  But I had some other crushes that confused me.  I liked a couple of gay guys, a few that liked makeup about as much as the girls did, though they didn't identify as gay, etc.  After coming home from the army, I felt lost.  I had the long hair that I twisted up under my helmet while I'd been there because I felt like it was the one feminine thing about me when nothing else was.  I was sad the day I cut it.  I got over it though.

&amp;#x200B;

So I went into security.  Again, the uniforms were unisex, and I felt good wearing mine.  A few friends were like ""You look like a guy wearing that"" and while they thought it was a burn, I liked it.  Then I met the father of my children.  He was a huge mistake, though my kids were not.  He insisted that I be feminine.  He bought me lacy thongs, tight pants, tight blouses, lingerie, heels, makeup, and I wanted to please him, so I wore that stuff.  Part of me was miserable the entire time.  When we split, it was an enormous relief.  But for a long time, I sort of forgot who I was.  I was still in ""feminine mode"" for years after.  Then one day, I put on men's clothes.  It was amazing.  But it didn't last.  After a while I wanted my tank tops and tight leggings.  I fluctuated back and forth so much I felt like a ping pong ball.  Then I sort of...got stuck in the middle.  The middle felt right.  I started dressing for me, wearing what I felt comfortable in.  I cut my hair short, wore a faux hawk for a while, colored my hair funky colors, and I was truly happy.  I still am happy.  I live about 80% in the middle.  Then I'll feel more feminine for a little while.  It'll swing over to masculine, and I'll feel that way for a long time before slipping back into that middle place.  Now?  In the middle?  I'll wear an overside tee shirt with leggings, I'll wear men's shorts with a women's tee shirt, I'll wear a dress with a hoodie, etc.  About 90% of the time I dress smack down the middle.  Right now I'm wearing a flowered pajama top that is a flowy tank top, with men's shorts.  I wore boxer briefs for the longest time, until my latex allergy got so bad that I couldn't anymore.  I had full body rashes and I hurt, so I went reluctantly back to panties, but with a covered waistband.  I've adjusted to them.  It's just how I am.  

&amp;#x200B;

My middle place, I don't feel like any gender.  I'm just...me.  My ears and nose are pierced, but I have tattoos that aren't feminine.  The one I got a few weeks ago is a quarter moon with a black cat sitting on it, because I have 2 black cats.  The artist got the colors wrong though, so I need to go somewhere else and get it fixed.  The next two tattoos I get are basically neutral.  It's just how I am.  Now what I can't figure out is, am I nonbinary?  Am I gender fluid?  Even when I feel more feminine or more masculine, I still feel more neutral.  I sometimes experience gender dysphoria, but that's usually when I do that swing.  When I'm feeling feminine I hate my lack of curves, the fact that I STILL can't do makeup right, and a few other things.  When I feel more masculine, I HATE having breasts, so I'll wear baggy shirts and sweat jackets.  I also hate that I don't have a penis during those times.  I hate having a vagina and the very idea of penetration is awful during that time.  I still sort of feel that way when I'm in the middle, leaning towards what I hate when I'm feeling masculine.  Except for the sex.  Penetration goes back to being ok for me.  

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know if nonbinary fits.  I identify as panromantic/demisexual, but am still unsure about genders, or if genders even fit at all.  I never felt like a girl.  Even in the dresses, curled hair and makeup, I just felt like I wasn't anything.  Does that make sense?  Even feeling masculine I don't feel that I am a man.  Am I making any sense?  This is why I can't figure it out.  I know, labels don't really matter, and as far as attraction goes, it really runs the gamut.  Currently I'm in my in-between place, where I do and wear my mix of clothing.  Growing up while my female friends were watching romance movies and gushing over the cute clothes the girls were wearing, or how cute the boys were and how cute the couples were, I was off watching horror movies.  I despise romance movies, except for one month of the year: December.  I watch those stupid, predictable, cheesy Christmas romance movies.  I don't know why, they suck, but that is the ONLY time I will watch anything even remotely romantic.  I stick to horror, thrillers, and action, almost exclusively.  Once in a while a comedy will be thrown in.

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, I just babbled, but I'm just wanting to know where I fit.  My older child is nonbinary, they/them, he/him pronouns, but was born with a vagina.  Is that what I say?  Is that the appropriate way to say it?  My younger daughter is female, bisexual with a heavy lean towards men.  It's about a 90/10 mix.  She's had a few girlfriends.  She's aromantic/bisexual.  I hope I described that right.  Ah!  This stuff is so confusing!!!  Anything on this subject would be greatly appreciated.",genderqueer,"Advice?

2019-09-21 04:14:31,d75vw9,3,3,"ok ok so also if anyone’s curious why I’m going back on T if I was dysphoric and lowkey miserable on T before, here’s the scoop --- tw for mentions of dysphoria (obviously), health issues, and eating disorders

Firstly, a lot of the issues I had while on T also had to do with how bad my mental and physical health were at the time - I was gaining a lot of weight and my anxiety and CFS were getting worse and those things are DEFINITELY related and T just kind of created the perfect storm to make me unhappy 

And, yes, some of the changes gave me whole new dysphoria! While I experienced dysphoria over my genitals and sometimes my chest and definitely my voice and height pre-T, on T the facial hair growth and the changes in my face and body shape were very upsetting to me (although, looking back, how much of that was due to weight gain and the worsening of my eating disorder is up for debate) 

Here’s the thing, though, is that I think also a lot of my struggle was with how incredibly fast changes were happening. It was like one day I recognized myself and the next day I didn’t. I was anxious, scared, intimidated, and felt ashamed that I had somehow made the wrong choice. It didn’t help that I realized part of why I’d started T was because I felt pressured by the queer community to medically transition even though I myself wasn’t totally sure about what I wanted yet. 

So, now my mental and physical health are in the best shape they’ve really even been in, even if neither are perfect y’know, and I’ve started to get my weight back under control. And with a lot of stress off my shoulders finally, dysphoria has really started to creep back in in a way it hasn’t in a long time, because I finally have the brainspace to process it. And I put a lot of thought into it, consulted with multiple drs and my therapist and my partners and friends and family, and I decided I wanted to try T again, at a much lower dose this time.

The way I see it, slower and milder changes is much more up my alley, and I know how to cope with and mitigate the less than pleasant side effects much better now than I did a year and a half ago. And honestly? I don’t totally plan to stay on low dose T forever either! I might change my mind and stay on, but mostly I want to complete and/or enhance some aspects of my transition that were put on hold before - like my voice needs to finish dropping, I’d like more bottom growth because oh BOY the euphoria I got from that was strong, and I’d be fine with more body hair and I’d like to work at building up muscles maybe this time, and most of that will stick around or only somewhat soften if I go off T again someday. 

Being nonbinary, really having any kind of complicated relationship with gender even if you are binary and tbh what trans person has a simple relationship with gender, can mean finding a nontraditional route of transition that can involve stopping, starting, and detransitioning and that’s super valid and doable! The important thing is that we all make the choices that ultimately make us happiest in our own skin.

I have lived as a transman for over 10 years. Now I'm starting T soon and have come to question my identity. Is there a place where it's easy to find information about being queer or bigender or enby or anything not binary?


I haven't really looked into it before.
To protect myself and be accepted I have had to act really binary to make people respect me and my identity.
Now I feel that I should look into it more.

I have kinda thought that there is only 3 genders and identities: female, male and agender (Intersex being a medical disorder)

Being bigender or genderqueer just feels ""not real"" and that someone just came up with it because they can't decide and are confused.
But that's probably just because I MYSELF think that I could never be accepted as one and try to hide in my egg.

I am AFAB and one thing I know for sure is chest and uterus periods are my greatest dysphoria. I have wondered before if I got top surgery and hysto if I would be happy/not still desire to transition, but I guess only time will tell. Does anyone know of doctors who perform hystos on people who aren't on T? I know it is much easier for someone who is on testosterone and even though I have the prescription I have not been super deligient in taking it. I am 20 years old and live in the United States.

Hey guys. I'm a 32 year old afab person. I figured out about 3 years ago my gender was off and very recently accepted that I'm transmasculine I want to start feeling more comfortable without coming out and have decided I want to grow out my underarm hair. All my other body hair is already grown out as I've always hated being and feeling hairless.

Is it common to get...freaked out about your underarm hair? I love it, I let it grow a few months last year but one day I was worried that someone would say something and quickly shaved them....and instantly regretted it. I'm trying to just say screw it and be comfortable. I am so excited to see how much underarm hair I can grow and how amazing I feel with it...but I also know that it may make me feel powerful and amazing but also uncomfortable at the same time.",genderqueer,Afab and growing out body hair....,1569908943.0,"{'created_utc': 1569883743, 'id': 'dbjqw1', 'num_comments': 4, 'score': 5, 'selftext': ""\nHey guys.
