When writing about this, it feels stupid, because I know that gender is a construct and whatnot, but I also don't really feel like a member of the lgbq community because, even though I identify as queer, I don't really know enough queer people to say that I feel like I belong. I often feel like I would very much like to be a woman. I'm attracted to women, but the idea of being a woman and being with a woman as a woman (if that makes sense) is incredible. I don't really know how to explain this intense desire I have. I'm sorry this is so rambly, but I've never really tried to write about it or talk about it at length before.

I guess I'm curious as to how I can look more androgynous, and how to feel comfortable doing it. I live in NYC, so no one but me really gives a shit what I look like, but I still have this pervasive sense of what's probably homophobia whenever I want to do something outside of my comfort zone. I paint nails now, which is nice, and I hate when they're unpainted, and I want to get more into makeup. My partner is super supportive and encourages me to wear her clothes and things like that, but my silhouette ends up being so clearly masculine that I hate it. No curves!

Can anyone relate to what I'm saying? I feel like I'm not queer enough, as though it's something that has to be earned. Almost like I'm not allowed to be trans, although I believe pretty firmly I'm not. I think, ideally, I'd want to switch between man and woman at will, but obviously that's not possible. I don't know. I'm confused and I want to figure it out and feel comfortable in my expression and feel like myself. 

tl;dr I want to be more androgynous and am afraid/don't know how to explore it and I have some shitty masculinity isues ingrained in me.

No curves!\n\nCan anyone relate to what I'm saying? I feel like I'm not queer enough, as though it's something that has to be earned. Almost like I'm not allowed to be trans, although I believe pretty firmly I'm not. I think, ideally, I'd want to switch between man and woman at will, but obviously that's not possible. I don't know. I'm confused and I want to figure it out and feel comfortable in my expression and feel like myself. \n\ntl;dr I want to be more androgynous and am afraid/don't know how to explore it and I have some shitty masculinity isues ingrained in me.\n\n[this is me for androgyny reference](https://i.redd.it/rh2p2qaec0f21.jpg)"", 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Somewhat confused, would love input', 'created': 1549510042.0}"

I have been browsing through various subs and have found some articles talking about how it is important to help young men assert their ""masculinity"".
I wonder if there was the same for women, such camps to help you """"connect"""" with a ""feminine identity"" and it got me wondering.

What is all this about? 

Because first of all, what is feminity/masculinity?

All I have seen are some extreme stereotypical views on it (for the feminine side for instance: ""if you want to feel feminine, put make up on, it helps"")
And found it really thought provoking.

Because afterall, it means that in our research for understanding who we are we try to put on labels this ""binary"" world agrees on, but that are terribly unclear!

I found it disturbing and felt the urge to share it with some people, because I am curious to see what you all think of it.

Have you read some good articles about it?

What is your point of view?

I would try them on but then quickly felt like I was doing something terrible and threw them away. 

When I moved out on my own I started to explore things but only panties and sports bras, I just assumed it was a fetish of sorts.

I still don’t understand why it was easy for me to buy a hot pink sports bra at the self checkout but I couldn’t bring myself to order online.

I came out to her and one of my other sisters who I knew would support me a couple weeks later.

So, Jeff here has always considered himself straight. He's definitely attracted to women, but funnily enough, never dated one. He's dated two afab nonbinary people though, one transmasc though not ftm, and one was more femme. Additionally, I'm afab and agender.

Not sure on his stance on amab enbys, though he made a passing comment of ""they're cute"" about one I dated if that counts for anything.

He's honestly quite the ally. Incredibly spportive of his LGBT+ pals, and I have no doubts when he says that he he sees trans men as men, trans women as women, and nonbinary people as, well, nonbinary, that he's 100% sincere.

Now here's what the post is about again of course. He isn't pan, he doesn't feel like identifying as bi fits him, but he doesn't feel right claiming to be straight either given his attraction to and relationships with nonbinary people. He's not a chaser or anything either. He considered himself heteroflexible for awhile, but dropped that because he thought no one would take him seriously.

So, I've been dating this guy for a month now, and I adore him to pieces. He is one of the best people i've ever dated and i see myself being with him for ages.

3 weeks in i did end up telling him I was nonbinary, and he said he didn't judge me for it and fully wanted to support me even if he didn't understand it fully.

The thing is, I know he does still see my as mainly a woman, not because he's being disrespectful but just because I am pretty feminine in features and he jusr doesn't understand nb. He is open to pronouns, but i told him he could still use she/her because im anxious about what he'd think if i used they/them. and while I have tried to explain and talk to him about me being nonbinary more, I don't feel like I truly know how to talk to him apart of it. Partly because whenever I do try to talk to him about it, I get really anxious and will talk about it really passively, instead of just directly say i'm talking about being nonbinary. 

I *know* he would be supportive about it if I talked to him about it more, and I know he wants to learn. Part of me wishes he would do research on his own time. I just need advice I guess from other nonbinary individuals dating cis partners how they have explained it to their partner, or how they've worked with it in their relationship.

2019-02-12 15:29:19,apugaa,7,1,"Hi. New account for obvious reasons.

I’m AMAB, he/him, 32 years old (a little late to be looking into this, I know), but I’ve never really identified strongly as male. I’m fine with it, I guess, but I don’t really fit the stereotypical mold. I’m a total beta male - shy, introverted, self-deprecating, empathetic, and without any of the cockiness, aggression, or toxic masculinity you see in many guys. I don’t like to speak out or call attention to myself, and I’m much more a follower than a leader. I don’t like to make waves or be in your face.

I don’t have any body dysphoria, but if I were suddenly transformed to have a woman’s body, I’d neither freak out nor rejoice - I’d be more like “Welp, guess I need to buy new clothes…” and move on with my life, without much having changed. I guess I feel towards my own sex like the Neutrals from Futurama - “I have no strong feelings one way or the other”

If I had to go back and pick from the binary choices, I’d probably pick male again, but not because of identity, more for perks like male privilege, better treatment in my occupation (computer programming), and actually having pockets in my clothes.

I’m fine with male secondary characteristics. I have no desire to take on a more gender neutral appearance, even in private. I lift weights and have a fairly fit body that I’m happy with.

In terms of orientation, I’m mostly straight, maybe 1.5 on the Kinsey scale. Low sex drive, often submissive, and I like cuddles as much as sex. Porn is a turn off when there isn’t an emotional connection - a ton of porn is downright abusive, but that’s a topic for another time.

I’ve taken a few online quizzes. One said cisgender. One said agender. One said my brain was ever so slightly on the male side of neutral.

&amp;#x200B;

For a while I was questioning if I was genderqueer or nonbinary or genderfluid maybe, or trans, idk, something that's not entierley ""girl"" or cis, and then it just stopped. I didn't care anymore and when I'd imagine myself with a male body I'd think,""No, I don't want that, I'm a girl. I'm cis and that's how I genuinely feel."" but now I'm questioning again. I don't know why. And now I'm thinking I'm genderfluid or something like that again.

&amp;#x200B;

Tbh I;m worried I just look like I'm making a mockery out of LGBT+ people, because everytime I think about it, it's not in an identity way, it's more like in a fun way??? Like,""Oh, that'd be fun, but I'm still cis"" like seriously, if I had the ability to switch sexes, I think that'd be cool, and I feel like I would wanna do it all the time but still have ""girl"" as my identity and only identity??? Maybe I'm just a stupid wanabe crossdress or crossdreamer or whatever and I'm just being an idiot??? idfk. I feel so stupid typing this out, like the answer is obvious and I'm just being a moron. I most likely am.

&amp;#x200B;

\----NSFW part here----

&amp;#x200B;

The only real consistency I feel with questioning all this  is that I don;t like my genitals. I mean like I'm fine with it but when I think about their purpose, it just feels...wrong??? Like I think I would like having a penis better than a vagina, like it just feels right in my mind. Honestly I feel like I only wish I had a penis when I'm aroused (which is rare honestly) and other than that, I don't care what I have. Then again I'm 19 and never masturbated or had sex so idfk what I'm talking about probably. My sexual fantasies about being a cute anime twink boy so yeah, my idea of sex is wrong and stupid. That was embarrassing to type.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically I feel like I'm mostly a cis-ish girl, but sometimes I wish I was a guy...but a girl at the same time...and I wish I had a dick sometimes...and at the time I always imagine gender as some sort of game. idfk anymore. What's wrong with me.

&amp;#x200B;

This post is just stupid and offensive and I'm sorry it's so weird, but that's how I honestly feel when questioning this stuff. Unrealistic fantasies of shape shifting and weird on and off stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry this is so rushed looking and horribly written, I've written the same stuff a million times and my feelings on how I perceive my own gender is confusing and weird and maybe a bit contradictory.

That was embarrassing to type.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo basically I feel like I\'m mostly a cis-ish girl, but sometimes I wish I was a guy...but a girl at the same time...and I wish I had a dick sometimes...and at the time I always imagine gender as some sort of game. idfk anymore. What\'s wrong with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis post is just stupid and offensive and I\'m sorry it\'s so weird, but that\'s how I honestly feel when questioning this stuff. Unrealistic fantasies of shape shifting and weird on and off stuff.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\'m sorry this is so rushed looking and horribly written, I\'ve written the same stuff a million times and my feelings on how I perceive my own gender is confusing and weird and maybe a bit contradictory.

2019-02-14 02:45:48,aqeyms,2,1,"(Okay so I tried posting this to r/asktransgender and it was downvoted almost immediately. Guess I'll try here instead.)

Talking about my gender has always been kind of an awkward subject for me because I guess I was never sure anyone would take me seriously. Furthermore, I don't totally agree with gender roles or labels, because the definitions of what is masculine and what is feminine always seemed arbitrary to me. And yet, I looked at what was considered ""masculine"", and concluded that even though there were some things I like about myself that I would consider such, by and large I don't really identify with it. I emotionally relate more closely with women, and on the inside I feel soft, sensitive, and feminine. Now that I've started digging into some of those feelings, I've realized I am much more comfortable expressing myself that way. Really though, I would rather just be able to express myself as whatever the hell I feel like. I'm told that's called gender-fluidity, which I have sometimes identified with in certain spaces, but I still formally identify as a male because it's easier to understand than whatever the hell I am.

I was towards the end of my high school career when I got to really understanding myself and my gender in this way. It was about the same time I started to experiment with wearing women's clothing. I've been doing it for long enough now that I have a small repository of women's clothing that I would either wear in my privacy or in the company of my best friend, who herself has gone a long way in helping me explore myself, helping me pick out clothes and letting me paint my toenails. When I dress up, I'll stay dressed up for a while, and then regret having to change back into my regular wear because it doesn't feel as comfortable. I don't dress up for very long or very often, partially because I'm usually not alone for long enough to dress up in my own space, and I only get to see my friend once every few months. The other reason is that it feels taboo, like I'm not supposed to be doing this because I'm physically a man and I wouldn't go out like this normally. I have taken measures to try and quash this feeling, including going to sleep in my women's clothes or posting pictures of myself in women's clothes on social media. It all seems in vain.

In terms of my physical appearance, I already have an established personal style; sort of an emo crossed with grunge look that I'm mostly content with. I would describe this appearance as masculine. And yet at the same time, I have this vision of myself as a lady that I'm obsessed with, and I've spent nights dreaming about it. It makes me feel insecure about my body, being that I have a very large upper build, facial hair and body hair that I neglect to shave at regular intervals, large hands and feet, and a noticeable belly (I'm not exactly the spitting image of health). It makes me feel like I could never achieve the feminine appearance I desire. I will look at images of other women and feel envious of their appearances. I struggled with basic self-care for a very long time because I felt so terribly about my body. I've seriously considered hormone replacement therapy. I don't consider any of these feelings to be actual dysphoria because I don't think I'm trans, though I could be wrong. Either way, I very much want to see myself as a woman in the same way I've seen myself as a man.

Truth be told, my growth was stunted for a long time because I never saw myself as ""good enough"" to challenge accepted definitions. I'm twenty years old now, and I only came out to my parents about all of the things about a month ago. I did so in hopes that I wouldn't have to feel ashamed of myself anymore. And now I'm actively working with my therapist to help me explore my feminine side. The more I dig into it, the more I feel like I could actually be transgender. And though maybe I'm expecting change to happen faster than it actually will, I'm still struggling to make it happen, and I would like to know what I can do to achieve congruence with my gender. I've been told that it's remarkable that I have such a deep understanding of myself given my age, but I could never really be sure if what I'm feeling is real. Whatever I am, I would like to rest assured that these feelings are valid and not something I've manufactured. I swear I'm not trying to run away from myself, I'm just trying to be myself.

I was born female and given a very feminine name that has no chance of being slightly altered to male (like going from Victoria to Victor or Nicole to Nicholas).

2019-02-19 17:18:24,ascry1,0,0,"Turned into a very long post so tldr: the title.

I'm currently in a diversity class and the idea that ""gender is not connected to biology"" came up as a set fact. I am a math-minded person so I was wondering what proof of this was there. I was not able to ask in class as it ended soon after.

But doing some quick proofs in my head, here was my best counterexample of this statement.

Lets start off with the premise that gender is not affected by sex at all. A premise I do not completely agree with, as the statistics are incredibly close on whether it beats the p-value, but I can safely ignore this notion in my proof.

We also know/assume that people do not choose their gender consciously, we identify as a certain gender, and it cannot be changed, otherwise people who are transgendered would not be facing the problems they do. (That may have come out wrong, if it did I apologize)

But if gender is not chosen, it has to be ingrained in us somehow. And the best answer for that is that it is ingrained in us biologically, part of our body. 

We already have scientific evidence that homosexuality can be tied to biology, how much testosterone or estrogen the person is given in the womb, as well as some data linked to it being genetic as well.

So it would make sense if something similar occurs with gender.

I of course understand that a lot comes down to a nature vs nurture argument, but most people agree that a person is built by both.

So the idea the gender is not linked to biology in any way is preposterous to me. It is almost certainly linked, perhaps not completely, but there is a link.

Can anyone explain to me how or if I am incorrect?

First time posting here and I hope this an okay place and okay thing to ask.

So as said title asks I'm debating my gender. For the longest time I've always just said female. I'm AFAB. And I am female identifying. But at the same time? Since I was tiny, I always always alwayssss have been more of a tomboy and always hated gender norms.

Anyways fast forward to me now, I'm 25. I havent changed really. If anything, I've started to present myself more androgynous with more typically masculine characteristics. dont get me wrong, I love dressing girly once in a while. but in general i like to present as a more gender ambiguous person.

I'm just concerned though, i mean, i dont mind the use of any pronouns. She/they/he is all good to me , IDC. And I dont really experience dysphoria, (other than a slight discomfort with my breasts which I'm planning to get a reduction so that I can look more gender neutral)

I've often debated, am I considered part of the genderqueer spectrum? Or am I just, an androgynous girl who likes to dress boyish? I dont want to claim I am genderqueer if I'm not, especially if I'm fine with my biological sex. Any advice on this?

I also posted this in r/questioning.

so i’m pretty sure i’m a girl. at least i have been pretty sure for most of my life. (i’m still a teenager btw.)  but lately i’ve just kind of been questioning it? sometimes I love makeup, and it makes me feel good, but other times it feels wrong, in a way. I have three items of traditionally male clothing in my closet, and about a week ago I tried them on and said to myself “god, why would I ever wear this?” but then the other day I wore the exact same outfit and felt very correct?? idk how to phrase it.

I know it goes deeper than just style, but I have no idea how to say it. I guess I just don’t feel like a girl all the time... idk if that makes any sense. gender dysphoria sounds way too dramatic for what i’m feeling, but at the same time I just know this probably isn’t normal. I have friends who I am close with that are trans, and dysphoria sounds awful. I really don’t think I have it, but then what am I feeling?

sorry if this kind of turned into a rant. i’m just kind of struggling with myself. i’ve never really liked labels in general, like with my sexuality even though i’ve embraced the terms bisexual or pansexual, I don’t feel very personally connected to them.

straight and gay were something that always confused me too. like, I know what they mean and all that, I just could never personally connect them to myself, even though I can picture myself with a man or a woman. is that a “symptom” that I might not be as cis as I though?

ugh. I guess with gender I always thought it would be black and white, but now that i’m struggling with this, I have no idea how to see myself. i’m fine with pronouns being she/her, but I guess I wouldn’t hate being called by male terms, or even just “they.”

for a long time i was like the time for coming out is not came yet because i was still questioning myself and i felt coming out would be awkward and cringe. well i still feel that it would be awkward but now i'm pretty hella sure i'm genderqueer. actually why i'm writing this post is to ask you guys what changed in your life after your coming out?

i mean my friends, family don't really care about whether male or female clothes i'm wearing or whether i have blue or red long hair until it's stylish. i can easily act and dress and be in my way without weird questions or without getting asked about my style or my anything.

BUT random people on the street/shop/party/whatever are always asking me ""are you a girl or what?""

Today I decided I was taking a month off of work to figure out exactly what my problems are after having suicidal feelings this morning. Depression has been with me (at least emotionally if not clinically) since my teens. I've got cognitive behavioral therapy lined up to deal with it, maybe. Although there are other factors involved, it's only recently that I made the connection that my feelings may have to do with how I feel about my body.

I've been talking with a transgender friend about this. After I described how I was feeling, she thinks that how I'm feeling is likely not dysphoria, but possibly body dysmorphia. I find some of my male characteristic physical traits to be upsetting. The most prominent one is my hair. I'm showing signs of male pattern baldness and in my late teens I was obsessed with it, but I repressed those feelings. I thought I was just being vain, so I felt really guilty about it. If possible, I would like to present as anything other than a man physically, and I think this is the main thing stopping me.

To that end I'm strongly considering trying to get started on finasteride. I've read about the side effects and honestly I'd still be willing to take it for upwards of a few years at least, or even indefinitely. I don't feel the need to *live* as a woman if that requires HRT, but I'd like to grow long hair and maybe dress in cute stuff. As a teen I was sometimes confused for a girl when I had long hair (although that can be common even among CIS folk of course). I kind of hated it when people started referring to me definitively as a man. I think if I took finasteride treatment, I'd be able to strike a good middle ground between being able to comfortably present androgenously and not necessarily having to commit to it forever. My only concern is that since I possibly suffer from depression, I've heard it can make things worse.

What do you think? I need to get a sick note from my doctor for work tomorrow re: depression, but I'm thinking of also telling them about identifying as non-binary and my desire for this treatment. Do you think it could help, along with potentially seeking help with dysmorphia symptoms? I worry that this behavior may be self destructive.

I am doing some research into gender-neutral cosmetics for my dissertation at university.

I have created a really short and simple questionnaire, and I was hoping you would be able to help me!

To answer this questionnaire, I simply ask that you class yourself as on the LGBTQ spectrum.
