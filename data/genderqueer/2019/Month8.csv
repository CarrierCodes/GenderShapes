2019-08-01 12:38:38,cknu23,0,1,"Ive known I was bi since I was like 11, but have recently realized that my main struggle is more with my gender expression than my sexuality. I don’t know if it’s just because tomboys are told they’ll grow out of it (which makes it less serious than a GNC adult). Even tomboy is not the right word, because that usually means just not liking “frivolous” feminine things, like makeup or high heels. I just like wearing androgynous or masculine clothing, having masculine hairstyles, etc. My interests are both masculine and feminine. My lifestyle is both masculine and feminine. I’m not put off by the “bro” types that my girl friends are, I find it easier to connect with men (tho I’m trying to connect to women as well). I just feel like there isn’t any room for masculine women who are dating a guy in any spaces. 

People never got to see me as a gay/bi woman. I’ve been dating my boyfriend since the end of high school. I’ve never dated a woman (despite my efforts in high school lol). To be a masculine gay/bi woman is one thing, to be a masculine woman in a “straight relationship” is another. So, despite coming out to my parents as bi (they both say “lol I knew that” so that’s good I guess haha), I’m sort of “in the closet” for the gender thing. 

As my relationship with my SO hits the 5 year mark, marriage is in the future for us. I just keep getting sad that I won’t ever be able to have the wedding I want. I’ve always wanted to sport a 3-piece-suit. Like many queer kids, I pretty much exclusively dressed up as men for halloween. It was my one chance to present how I wanted to present. As dumb as it sounds, I remember how alive I felt getting to dress up in a suit or as a male pirate (lol, sounds dumb but whatever). 

I get the same feeling now when I wear my normal clothes outside of my house. I wear pretty androgynous/masculine stuff most of the time (however there are a few dresses I sport here and there—it’s a shame men aren’t “allowed” to wear such comfortable clothes!). The thing is, I don’t think I’ll be able to wear the clothes I want for a wedding. Yes, everyone knows I wear masculine clothing on the reg. But it’s just a “tomboy” thing right? I just don’t like makeup or dealing with jewelry or fancy shoes. But OF COURSE for my WEDDING, I’ll dress up! Because it’s a fancy day, a formal event! I’ll feel “beautiful” in my dress. I’ll do that Anne Hathaway transformation and show everyone how beautiful I am when I’m in “feminine” clothing! Fuck no! 

LITERALLY ALL I WANT IS TO WEAR A THREE PIECE SUIT TO MY WEDDING. That’s it. I can even handle wearing a formal dress to other people’s weddings. It’s uncomfortable but whatever, my job is to be in the background there. Do I want to wear men’s formalwear? Of course, but I’ll put my discomfort aside for a bit. For for MY FUCKIN WEDDING, a think that is supposed to be celebrating me and my SO’s love, I don’t want to be celebrating my love to a version of himself that doesn’t exist, and his love to a version of me that doesn’t exist. I want to wear a suit. I love how I feel and look in a suit. I want to sport my usual fade, not “grow my hair out for my wedding.” He wants to wear nail polish. He wants to keep his hair long. 

I seriously dread the idea of having a wedding where I’m supposed to wear a dress. It’s so uncomfortable. It feels so fake, like every other formal event has felt to me for most of my life. It doesn’t feel right for people to be celebrating you when you’re wearing clothes you don’t belong in. 

I feel trapped in the closet here. I swear to god, me in a suit marrying a woman in a dress would go down a million times better than me in a suit marrying a man.

2019-08-01 16:39:17,ckqska,8,16,"So my whole life I’ve been obsessed with fitting in. And I’m having trouble separating that conditioning from what I actually feel. I’m having some pretty intense emotions and I just don’t know anymore. 

CW: There’s a bit of sex talk in here and internalised fat phobia. 

I find all these things so hard to talk about and I don’t know if I’m blowing it all out of proportion or what. I feel a bit sensitive and I’m scared that people will think I’m just being a whiney asshole, but I need to get this out and I do want to know what people think of it all.

My parents are very accepting people. They hate gender norms, my dad was a stah parent and my mum had a great career. I loved playing with my diverse toy collection, and only wore pretty dresses for parties. When I started school and saw how the ‘other girls’ were (this was mid 90s for context) with dresses and barbies and performative femininity I was obsessed with it all and desperate to fit in. I looked a bit boyish and was often taken for a boy when I was young because of my short hair and clothes, and I was so upset by it. I went to a Christian school (very normal in the UK btw, it’s not catholic school or anything evangelical, our village schools are just connected to the village church) and we acted out some story from the bible with one of the saints who has the same name as my dad. The teacher wanted me to play the saint because he has my dad’s name and I was hysterically screaming and crying because I didn’t want people to think I was a boy. 

As I grew up I stated developing a very ‘feminine’ body shape and I was relieved because now I could be normal. Another part of me hated it because I wanted to be a ‘tomboy’ but I was worried people would think I was ‘fat’ (I know I know, but I was 14) if I dressed that way with my curves, so I always dressed in ways that showed off my body. As I grew up I frequently had the urge to dress in suits and loved dapper styles but I ALWAYS ignored it because I thought I would look fat and was horrified by the idea. 

I’ve always felt this intense fear of being taken for masculine, and I don’t know what it’s about. Personality wise I’m not feminine at all. I dress that part but I definitely see it as a mask. 

Another thing is that I often imagine myself as a man with a dick having sex with a woman. Dunno what that’s about? 

But the thing that really confuses me is that I am obsessed with drag kings. Seeing drag kings perform makes me feel like I’m floating on a cloud, whilst simultaneously scaring the shit out of me. I want to try it, and to play with my gender, but I don’t know if this fear I feel is trepidation or horror at the idea. I also don’t know why I can’t just try it - I’ve been thinking about it for ages, can’t stop, but just can’t get up the nerve. I feel like if it were a really desire I wouldn’t be like that, right? I’m scared of something and I don’t know what it is. 

If you made it through this, thank you!

2019-08-01 19:29:57,ckt2og,6,48,"This is gonna be a long one so strap in. TLDR at the end so don't stress. And thanks in advance for taking the time to read this.

So I guess I'll start at the beginning since that usually seems to work best with these things.

I grew up in a typical white, conservative, middle class, Catholic home in SoCal. Despite having a very metered upbringing, even at an early age I began to identify certain feelings in myself in regards to gender and sexuality. For most of my childhood, I had a very sheltered and comfortable life. Looking back, it's almost miraculous how little interaction I got with the world outside of my immediate bubble. Unsurprisingly I never really developed a healthy vocabulary regarding anything to do with understanding one's own identity. It's ironic that when you have SO much privilege that you almost automatically become like something spat out of a factory. But I digress.

Fast forward to highschool, my father needed to relocate work and so we would be moving to Seattle. After moving and becoming somewhat settled, I realized quickly that moving to Seattle had been the single most important and beneficial life change I'd experienced up until this point. Later on I learned this was even more important than I initially realized. Being exposed to much more open, liberal, and diverse environment than I was raised in had a profound impact on how I viewed many things, particularly in myself. (And that really says something, because many people view Seattle as a pretty whitewashed city, but compared to my home town it might as well have been Mexico City).

While I lived in Seattle I met my now married partner, at the time an equally cishet Catholic girl, but now 6.5 years later is firmly trans agender New Yorker, currently prepping for top surgery. Over these few short years, we've been to hell and back together, and along the way we've had an incredible journey of self reflection and discovery. We discovered and came out together as pan and have explored/confirmed these feelings and emotions. Along with this of course, I have been side by side with them as they came to the realization they were agender. 

For many years, my partner struggled with (and still does in some capacity) a long list of mental health issues, ranging from crippling depression to bipolarism to schizophrenic outbursts. We worked through these ailments, and after finding treatment that works for them, they have been able to approach living something like a normal life. It brings me so much joy to have seen them grow in this way.

Soon after my partner began medication, the paramount feelings of body+gender dysphoria and dyspmorphia that had been previously buried by their former mental state began to surface. We've managed to work through this challenge as well, but of course everything is a work in progress. Needless to say, while I'll never truly know what it's like, I have seen first hand the very real pain and suffering a trans person goes through when dyspmorphia and dysphoria strike. I have, and will always be, in full support of my partner and their transition as well as every day after.

During my partner's journey of identification, I have been able to become much more educated myself. I've been read and researching on various topics so I can be a more helpful, more compassionate person with regards to gender identity, pronouns, etc. One of the books that sticks out is Gender Outlaws by Kate Bornstein and S. Bear Bergman. A great quick read if you haven't heard of it.

For most of my life, I've been able to pretty confidently say that I'm a male and happy as one. To date I have never experienced dysphoria in any way, and have never felt disconnected from my gender. In the past few months however, I've been making a lot of changes to my appearance and have taken on a much more feminine/androgynous profile. My hair is now the longest it has ever been in my entire life, I look for opportunities to use makeup, etc. My partner and I wear a shared wardrobe because we're basically the same size, and although it leans masc, I often tend to be drifting towards more feminine options. This is all very randomized from day to day as one might expect.

All of these changes I've been making were never conscious shifts towards a more fem appearance, but were simply things I wanted to try out of curiosity and found this, that, and the other thing just looked good on me as a result. I am very indifferent to pronouns for myself, but over time I've been increasingly identified as female by strangers and it feels really good when that happens. More and more, I want to continue this trend more proactively. This often makes my partner playfully annoyed because often I will accidentally end up looking more non-binary than they do. :P

So now we're here, and I'm questioning if I am not as strictly male as I thought I was. I've been struggling with this a little bit because as mentioned, I am very familiar with what real dysphoria looks like, and I'm not sure if what I'm feeling is valid or if I'm just along for the ride and THINK this is how I'm super feel. 

Nonetheless, my partner suggested a new name that immediately felt right and that has been a big turning point for me in how I view my own gender identity. If you have any thoughts about my story or any resources that might be useful, I'd love to hear about them.

If you have any thoughts about my story or any resources that might be useful, I'd love to hear about them.\n\n\n\nTLDR; I've been pretty confident about being male up to this point, but now after a thorough gender and sexuality education and journey, I'm not sure where I fall or if what I'm feeling is valid."", 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Conquered Sexuality, Now Questioning', 'created': 1564712997.0}"

Pride festival is on in my local city and I went along to a get-together for a trans and genderqueer social event.

Now apart from wearing a pride T-shirt, feminine looking jeans, and pink shoes, I was otherwise completely masc presenting, short hair, clean shaven, no makeup.

When I went to order myself a coffee the barista looked confused and said are you with the group? I said yes and she clarified “this is a *transgender* group” (emphasis hers) and again I said yes I’m with the group. Anyway she wasn’t convinced but I got myself a coffee.

I’m transmasculine/non-binary, and after a lot of debating, I decided to keep my first name (a very common girls’ name) and to legally change my middle name to something neutral or male. Part of that’s because I still kind of like my first name, and part of it is because I’m not out to everyone, including most of my family. Anyway, I figured that when I moved somewhere new for a job or school, I would go by that new middle name to make sure people perceived me properly. Simple, right?

So I’m still in the process of changing the name, but that will be done soon. (It’s a guys’ name, just not one that sounds super masculine.) And now that I’m moving somewhere new—I won’t say whether it’s for a job or school since that’s personal info—I notified the necessary people that I’m trans and want to go by my pending middle name. And the response was positive and supportive! Which is great, right? At last, I’ll have my preferred name and pronouns.

Except it’s NOT. Every time someone addresses me in an email by my preferred name—I haven’t actually met anyone in-person yet—I almost feel this sense of repulsion, like my brain is saying “no, no, wrong, WRONG.” And I don’t get it. I like this name. I want to go by it. I definitely identify with neutral/male  pronouns. So what’s the deal?

Seriously, I don’t know. (I probably need a therapist, but I don’t think I can afford one at the moment, lol.) I think part of it is impostor (imposter?) syndrome—like, I feel like I’m not legit or something, and so I think I don’t have a right to do all this. I mean, technically I don’t hate my first name—I just hate that it’s a common girl’s name that gets me perceived as she/her when I’d rather be seen as a dude or androgynous person. And I guess I’m nervous about passing, too. Plus, I’m going by my first name other places (like my apartment), so it’s...weirdly inconsistent.

But it’s more than that, and I don’t get it. I just know that I get anxious every time I get an email addressed to my preferred name.

2019-08-06 03:29:17,cmlcrx,1,3,"Hi friends! I'm looking for some advice about hesitant feelings I've been having towards changing my name.

Some Background info: I'm 22 years old, non binary, and go by they them pronouns. I'm out with my identity and pronouns to close friends as well as my partner but that's pretty much it. I've only mentioned the possibility of changing my name to a few trusted people briefly. Only my partner knows what my new name is. 

I've had a name in mind for years that I've always envisioned myself using when I am ""more out"" about being non binary. I pictured myself being brave and taking on this new name as soon as I ""come out more"" by telling my family about my identity and being ""more out"" in college. I didn't want to change my name in the past when I was halfway through university and face any potential push back from my classmates and profs. So I figured I should wait until college to enact this change when I'll be meeting a bunch of new people, instead of facing this giant hurdle when my peers have already known me by another name for years. I also always told myself that I would come out to my parents the summer before entering college.

This has been the plan for years and now its coming up in a few weeks, and I'm terrified. 

I don't know if its because of these nervous feelings or something else but I'm second guessing whether my ""new name"" really fits. I'm doubting myself, the new name doesn't feel like me the same way my current name doesn't feel like me. But it's not like there's a more recent different name that's attracting me now, it's just that nothing feels like ""me"". Suddenly I'm doubting a lot of what I though would be certain about my future and how I come out and how i get myself finally be ""me"".

I'm worried that I'm taking too big a step in such a short period of time by changing my name very publicly. I'm worried that I'll quickly realize that this new name isn't for me and I'll have to go through some sort of backlash by changing my name again. 

I'm not sure if anyone else felt this way while coming out or has any advice. I just haven't had much luck in finding others who may have felt this way and how they coped.

I'm 18 and born female. I started questioning my gender and sexuality at 16 or 17, and have ever since been in an growing state of confusion. The last half-year my mind has been in quite a chaotic state and am constantly asking the same questions over and over, in different ways.

At first, I though I was FtM trans, but the more time passed the more confusing it became and I am now in the state of considering other labels as options. And yes, I know I don't HAVE to label myself but I would feel a lot more at ease finding a befitting one, as many others do. 

I feel as if though there are many that fit me well, such as bigender, genderqueer, gender fluid, non-binary/androgynous or gender non-conforming. But I'm having a very hard time deciding. It would be really helpful if you could give your own experience as any of the above mentioned genders, and explaining the more accurate meaning of each title and their differences. 

More about me. Growing up, I was raised as a girl normally, and It never really bothered me. I remember liking playing with dolls a lot and I loved disney princess movies. I also liked hotwheels, and loved to see my brother play and show off his cool looking cars. I've always had a feminine and masculine side to me, and they played together very well in my childhood. 

As I started questioning myself recently, they have not been nearly as in synch as before and I feel a need to separate them from each other. My more masculine side I feel like has been neglected as I started maturing both in body and mind, I was now a ""girl"" instead of a child. I had no outlets for my masculine interest anymore. Of course I also got dysphoria and morhpia, I wore sports bras most of my highschool and when I finally did use some bras, it never really felt quite right. I still dislike bras. I want to be able to not waer them and am seriously considering boob reduction surgery, or cut them off entirely. As for other surgeries I'm not sure, but I do feel like I would perhaps feel more comfortable in a males body, but would still represent as female sometimes. I'm quite envious of intersex people, that would be the perfect medium for me. 

I will add more about my sexuality if it is allowed on here or you can suggest another subreddit if not.

2019-08-07 01:32:06,cmzcky,0,1,"""Genderqueer's a heavy word,"" I thought while driving to the DMV today. ""Why not identify as simply 'Gender-weird.'""

It then occurred to me that historically, ""queer"" meant ""weird.""

I used to be skeptical about the whole ""non-binary"" identity. Ironically, that's because I related too much to what they were saying. Oh, you're not comfortable performing your gender? Who is? What's that? You don't fully identify as a male or female? Well, we're all just genderless psyches that inhabit gendered bodies, because that's how I see myself and I can't imagine anyone having a different mind than me!

I also had moments in my life where I was super rebellious to my own assigned gender identity. Pirates of the Caribbean came out the summer before I went to college for the first time. I was obsessed with Captain Jack Sparrow's eyeliner and decided to wear some myself. I also decided to start wearing nail polish, even though the character did not. That was also the year I wore full on drag  to go to a Rocky Horror Picture Show. I had a friend give me a cool Indie chick makeover and I loved how I looked and felt. Made sure I shaved my legs. Yes, this all seems superficial and hyper-focused on fashion, but it led me to declaring in the laundry room of my dorm, ""I hereby denounce my masculinity!""

A friend of the family looked concerned that I was dolling myself up and asked, ""Are you a switch-it-er-upper?"" 

""A what?""

""Do you like boys and girls?""

""Oh, no,"" I said. ""But I'm like boys and girls?""

Had I continued down this path, maybe I would have settled into a long-lasting genderqueer identity. Instead, I cissed myself up and got a long term girlfriend.

It wasn't until recently that my desire to femme out revealed itself again.

Of course, this was also preceded by years of feeling like kind of an impostor in groups of guys - I couldn't put my finger on it, but I always felt in such a masculine crowd they would sniff me out and find out I didn't belong. I worked on a construction site last year... it was Hell. Again, I can't explain why, but I just didn't feel I belonged. That being said, people of all shades of masculine or feminine belong anywhere they damn please - I am aware of that.

So... I've been dressing as a woman at home. Thought it was a new gender identity thing, then a kink, and now I'm leaning into feelings of slight gender dysphoria. But I can't seem to trust my own thoughts. I think, ""Oh, you're an impostor! You're not trans enough to identify as anything!""

Actually, I start worrying about which group I'm culturally appropriating from: cis women or trans women? All women? Am I a dirty ""transtrender?""

It's just cross-dressing, but why is it so important that I feel like going out in public at some point? There are some local gay bars I might just want to visit all femmed out, but I'm afraid people will find me tacky and mocking other people's identities.

But I really want to interact with people who see me and recognize my femininity.

2019-08-08 08:11:37,cnintb,38,106,"First, I would just like to say that this is not meant to offend anyone who is genderfluid and amab. This is just a bit of a rant about things I’ve experienced lately.

As an afab genderfluid/nonbinary person, i feel there is a distinct stigma around being afab and genderfluid. I’ve heard multiple times from different people ranging from complete strangers that i’ve just met to close friends that, “LGBT is so trendy now, every teenager is gay or trans. You’re going through a phase.” Or, “Are you sure your not just a tomboy? I mean look at [insert any other female that dresses androgynously here], she dresses like a boy and SHE doesnt have a label or special pronoun.” And even sometimes, “She wears hoodies and pants and says she’s “gEnDeRfLuId” to be a special snowflake. Its all for attention. I’ve seen her wear makeup and watch romance anime, so she’s not really trans.” 

Lately I’ve been really jealous of my amab friends because of this. It seems people are much more likely to accept that you’re genderfluid and not just a tomboy or doing it for attention if you’re born a male who enjoys feminine things. I still like feminine things. I just like masculine things too, and I dont feel feminine in the slightest. It feels like everything would be so much better if I was born a male that likes makeup and romances. My physical attributes would look the way I want them to look, people wouldnt invalidate me as often, and I could express myself the way i truly want to. I notice I’ve been trying to overcompensate my masculine side and have been feeling more dysphoric than ever. Maybe I played with dolls and wore dresses when I was 5. Maybe i like to watch romancey things. Maybe i like to wear makeup sometimes.

2019-08-11 07:25:56,cotwtc,15,41,"Hi everyone, 

This is literally my first post to reddit ever, but I'm hoping I can find someone who can relate.  I was assigned female at birth and have identified strongly as being a lesbian since I was in high school. I've also known for sure I want a hysterectomy for about the same length of time.  I've always had debilitating cramps, and on top of that my pms depression has gotten worse and worse since entering the realm of adulthood.  I'm 23 now and I spend almost an entire week out of every month being completely unable to control my emotions, sobbing nonstop at anything and everything, and snapping at people I really care about and don't want to hurt. On top of all that, thanks to a now almost 3 year long struggle with chronic yeast infections (that have only responded to treatment with boric acid capsules and those are irritating as hell), I have lost all desire to continue to have a vagina.  

As you might guess, thanks to all that I don't exactly have a roaring sex life.  I'm very fortunate that my girlfriend (who I've been with for almost 4 years) has been incredibly understanding of all of my physical ailments, but we both wish that the sexual component of our relationship was stronger.  I'm a stone top, and I really enjoy eating her out, but even that's difficult for me to do without a lot of neck pain thanks to a rare condition I have where the bottom part of my brain pokes down into my spinal column.  

All that being said, I recently decided to pursue getting a total hysterectomy and vaginectomy through a local trans clinic that works on the informed consent model.  I have my first appointment on Thursday.  I'm super excited, but I'm also worried that I'll be met with resistance or confusion because I don't exactly intend to stop identifying as a woman.  I know I'm not a ciswoman™ but I still feel a connection to womanhood, and in a practical social sense I know for sure that I am never going to feel more comfortable in the men's locker room than I do in the women's locker room.  I'm fine with id-ing as nonbinary, but as kind of a modifier before woman. Pretty much all my dysphoria stems from things that are medical problems but no cis OBGYN is willing to give me the fix I want for them because to them it's too drastic.  I've also been a bit discouraged/frustrated because all the surgical transition resources I've found for afab non-binary folks are focused on top surgery or like, getting meta but keeping the vagina.  I can't find anyone else who just wants a vaginectomy.  I'm starting to feel like a gender alien.

I have become more and more masculine over the past few years after dropping out of fashion school and spending a very long time deconstructing my dependency to makeup.  Now I pretty much only wear makeup for events, and I only do experimental/editorial looks that feel more like a form of drag.  I still have a lot of fun performing femininity for performance art's sake, but on a normal day I feel better when I feel more butch.  Even though my performance of gender is often more masculine, I don't see embracing masculinity being the same as embracing maleness, and at the end of the day I really just feel like a very confused dyke with a really weird set of health problems.  I don't exactly feel like I'm transitioning to another gender, I just want to be able to live in a body where I don't have an adversarial relationship to my own genitals.  I feel like pursuing these surgeries will help me feel more confident and comfortable in my own body, especially sexually and I feel like that counts as treating dysphoria.

2019-08-11 09:42:35,couvcw,4,9,"I want to apologize in advance for this complicated mess of a post.

I’m 23 and AMAB, and I’ve been been identifying as non-binary for a few months now.  Mainly just in my own head, cause i havent really come out to anyone i know in real life yet, cause i have zero self esteem and i’m terrified what my friends and family will think.  Im also terrified that maybe im not really non-binary and im just faking it to make myself feel better about myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I dont think i “feel” male, but i dont necessarily feel female either (although sometimes i think i do).  I feel like my ideal body would be genderless and androgynous, with no reproductive organs.  

&amp;#x200B;

Back in high school, i remember sometimes secretly wanting to be female, but that was only some of the time; a lot of times i wouldnt care that i was male, or at least i didnt really think about it.  I would sometimes feel compelled to find ways to make myself look/feel more feminine, usually in small ways, like wearing womens’ jeans or wearing eyeliner.  I used to try on female clothing in secret sometimes.  I thought my body had a somewhat-feminine shape and was proud of that (really i was just fat, lmao).  I shaved my legs and body hair sometimes.  I tried to teach myself to have really feminine handwriting and secretly hoped that someone would mistake it for a girl’s handwriting...That probably sounds really stupid.  I went through a whole “emo” phase that, in retrospect, was somewhat just an excuse for me to try and make myself look more androgynous.  I sometimes secretly hoped someone would mistake me for a girl, but i also thought that was unrealistic.  

I was going through a bunch of stuff like that back then, but at the time, I kinda just wrote it off as “teenage hormones” and assumed everyone went through stuff like that.  I grew up/went to high school in a small, non-diverse town, do at the time, i didn’t know about non-binary identities, and i hardly knew anything about transgender either.  Im sorry for my bad grammar.  Its really late at night.  

&amp;#x200B;

Later on, in college was the first time i learned about non-binary identities and I immediately felt i identified with that. I experimented with identifying as agender for a while, but decided to drop it because I was experiencing serious self-doubt, and i had this extreme debilitating fear that i was just faking it for attention or something.  All my non-binary friends and classmates seemed so sure and so confident in their identities and they seemed like they had always known they were non-binary, and i felt like an impostor.  I went for the next like, five years after that convinced i was male, identified as male, went by he/him pronouns, etc.  i didnt really question my gender identity during that time, although in my mind, i sometimes considered myself “a genderless spirit in a male body” that felt comfortable identifying as male.  

&amp;#x200B;

Then a few months ago, i was sitting in my friend’s car, zoning out, and i completely randomly had the thought “I’m a woman.” and I felt like i’d had an epiphany.  It was the weirdest feeling and i can’t really describe it.  It was really intense.

&amp;#x200B;

After that, over the next few weeks, i steadily kept thinking about my gender identity more and more until i couldnt stop thinking about it.  I questioned for a couple weeks at first if i was mtf trans, but now i think its more likely that i’m genderfluid, or agender.  I’ve come to the realization that i really kinda hate having an uh... male part, and i wish i could get rid of it, and be completely genderless down there.  I sometimes wish my body was more feminine, but other times i just want to be androgynous.  I’ve realized i don’t necessarily like having a male voice, either

&amp;#x200B;

With all that being said, im still extremely afraid that maybe im just faking it to feel special or something.  Theres a bunch of stuff that just doesnt add up.  

\-I never really questioned my gender identity at all until around age 15.  

\-When i was a little kid, i mean line ages 3 to like 10, i actually had an extreme fear of being mistaken for a girl and would refuse to any clothes that i perceived as looking “feminine.”  This ended by age 10 or so, and as i said before, around age 15 was when the gender stuff really started for me.  

\-Ive never felt bothered by being referred to by male pronouns, although it equally wouldn’t bother me to be referred to by female pronouns.  I currently (mentally) refer to myself by they/them pronouns, but sometimes i still slip up and refer to myself as he/him

\-I had some weird daydream today about being old and having some boring office job and i was still male

\-sometimes i catch myself thinking about myself as a guy/a man

And a bunch of other stuff like that, probably, that i cant think of right now cause im half asleep and also i dont want to make an annoyingly long post which ive probably already done oops

&amp;#x200B;

So anyway, do you think it sounds like i might be non-binary, or does it sound like im cis male and faking it?

Im new here and, honestly, just looking for advice. I’m going to jump right into it, that might be helpful...

I’m 30 years old and was born male. However, for as long as I can remember I’ve always aligned more with female gender norms. I would spend time growing up dressing up when I could and surrounding myself with friends who were girls as a way to be their “cool guy friend” who they could make over and dress up without the judgement of it all. I’ve always been very emotional and nurturing, I’ve valued fashion and glamour over sports and getting dirty. I’d rather watch a romcom (Hey, Meryl, you queen!) over an action flick (unless it has Daniel Craig... you get it). And so, being friends with the girls made all that easier!

Unfortunately, when I was very young my father caught me dressing up. His response was physical abuse and humiliation. Since then I felt like I had to hide my femininity. I kept trying to express myself in private but wasn’t able to ever truly be free. I then joined the military and was surrounded by your traditional “toxic masculinity” culture. I guess over the years I’ve felt the need to suppress who I was so much that I started to think my desire to be a woman was a phase.

Fast forward and over the last year my identity has taken a hit. More than ever before I found myself hating that I was born male and wishing I was a woman. It led me into a pretty deep depression surrounding my male identity and feeling “stuck” as a person I didn’t love. I’m in a hetero marriage (I identify as bi) and recently shared my desire to become more feminine with my partner and came out to her as bi. She has been INCREDIBLY supportive, which was unexpected.

Here’s where I need help. Despite her support I still find instances where I internalize her actions—maybe we plan a “girls night” and she comes up with reasons not to do it, or she subconsciously points me toward male normative behaviors or fashion and it hurts.. This really just drowns me and I feel like I was wrong for being honest and authentic. In my expression I’m not sure where I exist, I’m not sure how to confidently be feminine and not be judged. I think there’s just a weird erasure to it all and it’s made me really desire a community.

I guess I feel like I was super excited to “come out as both bi and gender queer” but I’m struggling with the actual living of it. I truly don’t feel like I fit as a male and wish so desperately feel something real. I’m afraid of losing people close to me, even if they’ve been supportive but I also want to be true to myself.

2019-08-13 06:56:38,cppfio,4,21,"I came out a week ago today, and sent this letter to my family.  They have been overall pretty supportive :) Maybe this will help someone else out there trying to write some kind of letter or ""come out"" in any kind of way :)

Much love.

&amp;#x200B;

Hey fam,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing you all because I wanted to share a bit of information about myself with you all. I hope that through this email you may know me a bit better and I may be able to articulate a part of myself I haven’t always been able to. Thank you for taking the time to read this, much love!

Okay so here is the information… I am starting to identify as being genderqueer. What the heck is genderqueer you may be wondering?? Genderqueer basically means gender that exists outside the traditional gender binary (boy/girl). When I say that I am genderqueer I am expressing that I am neither a girl or boy. It is basically a word that means my gender is queer (non-normative).  If you placed me on a spectrum, with ‘masculine’ being at one end and ‘feminine’ being at the other, I’m somewhere in-between, and somewhat always fluctuating.

As a kid I always felt relatively frustrated and often confused about gender and why having female anatomy made me all of a sudden qualified as “girl”. While I didn’t have the language to express it, I was definitely always playing around with my gender expression and either secretly (or publicly) rolling my eyes at “girly” things.  I want you all to know that I am still the same old \_name\_, just \_name\_ who is starting to see themselves more clearly and with some words that finally feel like they match how I’ve always felt.

I also just wanted to let you know that as of now I don’t have any plans to transition my gender physically (aka no medical or hormonal changes). Coming out as genderqueer, for me, is more about expressing and naming my gender identity. I still exist in a female body, I am just no longer conforming or subscribing to the prescribed gender given to me at birth. 

As I continue to embrace my gender I am starting to ask that people use gender neutral pronouns when talking and thinking about me. Instead of referring to me using she/her pronouns I would prefer that you use they/them pronouns. Example: “Oh there goes \_name\_, they are walking to the grocery store! Oh \_name\_, I love them.” It may seem strange at first, but with a bit of practice using gender neutral pronouns becomes really natural and would mean so much to me! This also extends to words like daughter, sister, aunt, gal, etc. Using gender neutral pronouns sometimes involves a bit of creativity (child, sibling, untie, pal, etc.) but it does wonders in terms of re-framing how people see me through time. :)

I am eager to share this with you all because it feels like an essential and beautiful part to who I am. I hope that this is is not too much information or too overwhelming. I wrote this as a letter to allow you some space to process if you needed it. Feel free to reach out when you feel ready, I am hopeful and excited for this growth season.  

I love you and am so grateful for all the ways you have loved and held me. Thank you for letting me share this part of myself with you. 

ALSO, here are some links to some great articles that I think are SUPER HELPFUL…

So I am 18, born with female anatomy. Since birth, I have always been the more ""masculine"" one in the family.

I've always had really bad dysphoria but due to growing up in a very conservative Christian home I never knew what it was and just thought I was uncomfortable because I was ""too fat, too skinny, big forehead, ugly smile, thick thighs, tiny arms"" and yeah you get the point. I always made excuses for it. When I went to college it got worse and I started over femenizing everything on my dysphoric days (which I still didn't know was dysphoria). I just assumed it was because I'm not as pretty as my two sisters and never get along with other girls as friends so I tried to make up for it in making everything I did super feminine. 

Fast forward and I just discovered what dysphoria is. It's been worse since I identified it. My problem arises where some days I feel like I should be a guy and other days I'm not dysphoric at all and enjoy being feminine. My dysphoric days are bad though, to the point where by the end of the day i convince myself that I'm a trans guy, but in a day or two I'm perfectly happy being a female. I've been going with gender fluid, but from what I understand gender fluid is when you sometimes feel more masc and sometimes more fem and some right in the middle, etc. But on my dysphoric days, I feel like I AM a trans male, not just more masculine that day.

I could have this all wrong as again, I grew up in a conservative Christian home and was homeschooled so I never learned any of this or was around anyone who wasn't a conservative Christian. 

Any advice on how to identify and also how to make those dysphoric days better? Anyone know why my dysphoria has gotten significantly worse since I identified it? I also never have bottom dysphoria but have dysphoria about everything else, I'm not sure if that makes a difference.

2019-08-14 01:18:55,cq2m05,9,4,"Hello everyone. First of all I would like to apologize if this isn’t the appropriate place to discuss this. I also apologize for any improper use of terminology.

I have always been open minded when it came to peoples sexuality. Love is love, it really should be that simple. I’m from a small town so the whole concept of non-binary genders is somewhat new around here (short of the traditional perception of what “trans” is). That is to say I grew up, like most folks, not ever really questioning the binary. You were either male or female. Gay or straight. Maybe bi. 

In the last few years, some awesome and progressive minded friends have taught me a lot about gender flexibility, and how we should all stop thinking about gender as it relates to our biology or our sexuality. I’ve since considered myself an avid and outward supporter of genderfluidity, or simply, supportive of the idea that anyone should be able to identify as whatever makes them comfortable in their own skin. And, most importantly, no one should be harassed or bullied for doing so. 

So I’ve “talked the talk,” at least when it came to my social circles. 

Then I met my current partner. Now I want to “walk the walk”

We met at a bar about 3 months ago, and have been dating for the last two. I did not know they were genderqueer until after we started texting after the night we met. It was unexpected but did not dissuade me in the least. Getting used to pronouns was and continues to be a challenge after some 30 years of referring to everyone as he/she, but I feel it has helped me honestly seem them as neither male nor female. Some days they present very feminine and others very masculine. I think they are beautiful always. They have totally turned my world upside down and am so lucky to have found them. 

After all that rambling, I guess my question is, what is my sexuality? I have always considered myself a straight male, and in a way I still feel that I am as I don’t think I’d be sexually attracted to them if they were biologically male. I feel like this might be dismissive of their gender preference, though, because it doesn’t acknowledge their masculinity. 

On the other hand, I feel as though considering myself “bisexual” is appropriation in a way, if that makes sense. It takes away from other folks who consider themselves bisexual. 

Obviously I’ve discussed this at length with them, but we both thought it might be good to get some outside perspective on the matter.

2019-08-20 16:19:28,ct1j76,2,3,"I'm going to post this question in a few subreddits, so some of the explanatory text might seem obvious...

My gender identity is [non-binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender) meaning it's a little of column A and a little of column B (and column C/D/E/etc. for those who don't want to view gender as strictly binary), and the amounts fluctuate often. I am AMAB (assigned male at birth) and have no plans for any sort of gender-affirmation surgery (i.e., [sex reassignment surgery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_reassignment_surgery); me and my spouse are perfectly content with my tackle, as it exists.

I prefer lace underwear, which isn't typically designed with the male in mind. There is lace underwear made specifically for men, but I've found it to be low quality and tends to fray and fall apart quickly. So far, I've purchased from [Male Power](https://malepower.com/musthaves/sexy/), [Joe Snyder](https://joe-snyder.us/shop-by-collection/lace), and a couple random online sellers whose products were, upon receiving them and looking closer, just modifying inexpensive female underwear with a pouch for the male package (while it is annoying to find out you paid $20 for a pair of modified Aerie underwear, kudos to the business acumen of the person who's snagging them during their 10/$35 sales, sowing on a pouch, and charging over five times what they paid). The one high-quality pair of male lace underwear I've found is [Hanky Panky's men's original rise thong](https://www.hankypanky.com/men-s-original-rise-thong.html). I wish Hanky Panky offered male options for more of their styles, but that's not currently the case. 
A lot of Hanky Panky's female underwear work for AMAB without [tucking](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/d3ggjj/how-to-tuck) or using a [gaff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaff_(clothing)) (I have zero interest in tucking or using a gaff), but the bit of extra fabic Hanky Panky added to their mens thong does make it substantially more comfortable than the female-designed version of the same thong.

I am AMAB but for quite a while I've felt like that just isn't who I am. I don't like my body or facial hair; have never behaved in very masculine ways; want to try things like makeup and more feminine clothing; and just generally feel that I would have been happier with myself if I'd been born female. 

All that said, any sort of dysphoria I might feel has never gotten to the point of causing serious mental or emotional problems for me, and as of right now I have no intentions of any sort of transitioning because of a large number of reasons. I likely couldn't afford it, I'm not very educated about the whole process, and my family has some less than educated ideas about how gender works. 

However, there are little things that make me happy that allow me to express a more feminine side of me.

2019-08-29 05:53:04,cwwr6o,6,11,"I've always found it curious how often people in the transgender community will engage in the same gatekeeping tactics that they themselves have long opposed from the gay community:

Some **gay men** argue that **trans people** do not belong in the same community, insisting that

* trans people are just riding on the coat-tails of successful gay rights activism.
* gender identity is being needlessly confused with issues of sexual orientation.
* inclusion of trans people is holding back back progress for achieving gay rights.
* trans people should remain on the sidelines so that gay leaders can take charge.
* the needs and concerns of trans people are secondary to the cause of gay rights.
* trans people deserve visibility and support, but only upon approval by gay men.
* trans people pose a direct threat to the legitimacy of the gay rights movement.

Many **trans women** argue that **gender nonconforming** people do not belong in the same community, insisting that

* gender nonconforming people are just riding on the coat-tails of successful trans rights activism.
* gender presentation is being needlessly confused with issues of gender identity.
* inclusion of gender nonconforming people is holding back progress for achieving trans rights.
* gender nonconforming people should remain on the sidelines so that trans leaders can take charge.
* the needs and concerns of gender nonconforming people are secondary to the cause of trans rights.
* gender nonconforming people deserve visibility and support, but only upon approval of trans women.
* gender nonconforming people pose a direct threat to the legitimacy of the trans rights movement.

Indeed the sheer number of parallels is frightening, even down to the fact that gay activists will often lend support for trans rights, but only when it's convenient to boost the numbers or to give an illusion of solidarity for sake of publicity. But as soon as nobody's looking, then trans people take a back-seat in advocacy once again.

2019-08-30 09:11:04,cxee9c,0,1,"Hey, I created this account to see if I could find others that might be in the same boat as me. 

Story time?

For as long as I can remember, I’ve always been pretty comfortable with being a cis gendered female. I grew up surrounded by LGBT friends and allies and went through a lot of soul searching as a teen. From being straight, to lesbian, to bi, just all over the board. My sexuality is something I’ve never been confused about, I just fell into exploring at an early age and knew that I wasn’t straight. 

Fast forward to now, age 25. I’m comfortable enough to say that I am pansexual confidently. 

Recently, I’ve been having these doubts about myself. I’ve never been very feminine, but I was always at peace with who I was. Even now, I’m not physically feeling out of myself. It’s mentally. Mentally, I feel very non binary. And it’s eating away at me a bit because I have no one to talk to about it.

It started with my past relationship with an ftm trans male. With him, I felt like a, for lack of a better term, ‘top.’ I explored with him something I had never explored sexually, and it just felt so right. 

I’ve come to admit to myself what I’m interested in, and it makes a lot of sense to me, but it’s something I can never really live out. Being a female, with an attraction to gay men. I’ve told a friend before, that it feels like I’m a gay male at points, and mentally, I want to be that, but i would never go as far as changing my appearance or injecting T.

So, I guess what I’m wondering is; Does anyone else know what I’m feeling? Have a word for it? I’m just so confused with who I am, it’s making me feel helpless for not being able to find someone to be with that will make me happy because it’s so impossible to find someone I’m interested in to want to try that with me.",genderqueer,Extremely confused and hoping I’m not alone...,1567181464.0,"{'created_utc': 1567156264, 'id': 'cxee9c', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Hey, I created this account to see if I could find others that might be in the same boat as me. \n\nStory time?\n\nFor as long as I can remember, I’ve always been pretty comfortable with being a cis gendered female.

I'm from a writers’ resources company called Winning Writers. Part of our mission is to find and promote voices and themes underrepresented in publishing, including (but of course not limited to) racial, cultural, national, religious, gender/sexual identity, body positive, and [dis]abled. We are interested primarily in the representation of the voices/themes in the poetry, rather than the identity of the writer. The [Tom Howard/Margaret Reid Poetry Contest](https://winningwriters.com/our-contests/tom-howard-margaret-reid-poetry-contest) we are running right now offers two first prizes of $2,000 each. Ten honorable mentions will receive $100 each, and the top twelve entries will all be published on our site. The contest is international and the deadline is September 30. I’m posting here specifically because our long term goal is to change the composition of our entry pool to include more entries featuring diverse characters and themes. These voices need to be heard, and we are actively reaching out to find them. 

Sometimes when I post, there are some replies worried about a scam, so in order to head that off I just want to say that our competitions are listed by The Write Life as some of the [top writing competitions](https://thewritelife.com/writing-contests/) out there, and we’re in Writer’s Digest’s [top eight](https://www.writersdigest.com/online-editor/top-websites-for-writers-best-publishing-marketing-resources) sites for writers. Besides contests, we also offer a lot of free publishing and style resources, including a database of free poetry and prose competitions, at https://winningwriters.com/
