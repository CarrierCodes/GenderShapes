She just bought quite a number of things. And asked if I was okay with her seeing me topless for a fitting. She asked me if it was okay touching me when I needed help. And just asked how I felt about certain bras. What I liked. If I felt good in it. Eventually I did pick one.

She showed me a couple others there was one I was so so about she said I don't know how many you're getting but it's okay to build up a collection one by one.

She offered me a beer while I was in the fitting room. At the end after picking out my bra and getting dressed. I sat and finished it while we chatted for a bit.

It was really lovely and I can see why people recommended it. I ended up spending $22 which I hear is quite cheap.

She told me that my size was 38B.

TL;DR I really like being a woman, but I just really want a penis.

I'm 21 years old. I was born female. In the last year or so I've been learning a lot about myself. I've broken up with my abusive ex boyfriend and started a new life with a wonderful person. Getting out of this abuse environment has lead me to have more time to think about - and work on - myself. 

I've accepted the more feminine side of myself. I love make-up, I love making my hair look good, I love buying clothes that make me feel good and sexy. And this makes me feel good too! Finally the energy I spent keeping my ex happy, I'm spending on making myself feel amazing!

However I've noticed something that's been there all my life. I get this intense jealousy of guys jerking off. Today was especially hard hitting. I've always kind of joked about wanting a penis but today it actually made me feel hostile toward my partner in a way I never really expected.

TMI: I have a little bit of experience with pegging and honestly it's one of the greatest epiphanies I've had ever. I love walking around with the strap-on on. Whenever I have fantasies pretty often I'm the one doing the stereotypical male moves. But then the other way around is awesome too.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know what to think about this and I'm honestly really confused. Could I be genderqueer? If I present as a binary woman yet have this lingering desire to have male genitalia? 

And does that make me less of a woman? I don't think so though. 

I'd really love to hear thought/stories/opinions from more people like me. I come from a very binary background and until a bit ago genderfluid/genderqueer was unbelievable to me.

2019-11-03 13:22:31,dr0asv,0,1,"On the outside I'm a typical ""30s something mom/wife"". I've always been a tomboy. I've always been more masculine in nature. I've always had a huge discomfort with my chest. I've always liked my body hair. But besides that....I'm a mom, I'm a wife in a seemingly hetero marriage.

On the inside over the last 3 years I've come to the realization I'm not comfortable with my female body. My body hair even fully grown out is lacking. I have no happy trail, and my arms, legs , chest, stomach, hell even my behind is too hairless. I hate it. My chest isnt flat. Though I dont have bottom dysphoria, the thought of bottom growth excites me beyond anything. I'm jealous of my husband for being able to grow a glorious beard while I shave the little bit of peach fuzz I have so I can feel the ""stubble"" as it begins to grow back in. If I think of how I'd like to look, I'd look like a big hairy lumberjack type guy. Short hair, beard, beefy, Jean's and flannels. Though I'm in a straight seeming marriage I feel more comfortable thinking of myself as a gay man.

My husband knows, and hes totally cool with trying things and allowing me to be me. Hes all for me doing what I need/want. So theres no issues there (for now). I cut my hair bit my female body made my haircut feel awful so I'm currently growing that back out. I've let all my body hair grow, and most days i love it but there are a few days that i think about shaving. So far i havent thankfully. Because i think I'd be mad at myself for shaving if i did that. My husband has helped my pick out clothes other than my typical jeans and tshirts, though my chest and hips are simply too large to look decent and feel comfortable wearing them so I'm back to my Jean's and tshirts. I'm not and havent been binding as of yet but will start soon probably. I have some boxers that I enjoy to wear and like packing at home though for now I simply pack with socks until I get a good packer. My husband wants to try oral with me...and I have no growth and am pretty small, so id like to find a way that oral with a toy would feel natural for both of us.

I have no issues with my voice, but I think this is mostly because I'm in a female body....so it doesnt bother me.

With that being said, I dont care that people see me as a female. I dont hate dressing up and wearing dresses because I know my rather large is good for dresses. I dont care about my pronouns and the thought of socially transitioning is not appealing to me.

What do I do with this? Am I truly FTM?? Am I just on the spectrum? Do I partially or fully transition?

I\'ve always been a tomboy. I\'ve always been more masculine in nature. I\'ve always had a huge discomfort with my chest. I\'ve always liked my body hair. But besides that....I\'m a mom, I\'m a wife in a seemingly hetero marriage.\n\nOn the inside over the last 3 years I\'ve come to the realization I\'m not comfortable with my female body. My body hair even fully grown out is lacking. I have no happy trail, and my arms, legs , chest, stomach, hell even my behind is too hairless. I hate it. My chest isnt flat. Though I dont have bottom dysphoria, the thought of bottom growth excites me beyond anything. I\'m jealous of my husband for being able to grow a glorious beard while I shave the little bit of peach fuzz I have so I can feel the ""stubble"" as it begins to grow back in. If I think of how I\'d like to look, I\'d look like a big hairy lumberjack type guy. Short hair, beard, beefy, Jean\'s and flannels. Though I\'m in a straight seeming marriage I feel more comfortable thinking of myself as a gay man.\n\nMy husband knows, and hes totally cool with trying things and allowing me to be me. Hes all for me doing what I need/want. So theres no issues there (for now). I cut my hair bit my female body made my haircut feel awful so I\'m currently growing that back out. I\'ve let all my body hair grow, and most days i love it but there are a few days that i think about shaving. So far i havent thankfully. Because i think I\'d be mad at myself for shaving if i did that. My husband has helped my pick out clothes other than my typical jeans and tshirts, though my chest and hips are simply too large to look decent and feel comfortable wearing them so I\'m back to my Jean\'s and tshirts. I\'m not and havent been binding as of yet but will start soon probably. I have some boxers that I enjoy to wear and like packing at home though for now I simply pack with socks until I get a good packer. My husband wants to try oral with me...and I have no growth and am pretty small, so id like to find a way that oral with a toy would feel natural for both of us.\n\nI have no issues with my voice, but I think this is mostly because I\'m in a female body....so it doesnt bother me.\n\nWith that being said, I dont care that people see me as a female. I dont hate dressing up and wearing dresses because I know my rather large is good for dresses. I dont care about my pronouns and the thought of socially transitioning is not appealing to me.\n\nWhat do I do with this? Am I truly FTM?? Am I just on the spectrum? Do I partially or fully transition? I know these are all questions I need to answer myself but for years now I\'ve been struggling with myself and my non answers.

a bit about my story so far:

i was raised Mormon and served a mission for the Mormon church then came out as bisexual returning from my mission. after which, I married my ex-wife and while married told her I thought I might fall under the trans umbrella. i rapidly left the Mormon faith publicly (in reality I had not believed for years).

after my divorce I did not know where my transition would lead me--I wasn't sure about my gender. my therapists have all been unsuccessful in helping me pin down a gender many of them wanting me to pick male or female saying that if I transition with hormones or any surgeries I should be landing on the binary.

i am not a woman, I am not a man, i am ""third-gendered,"" i use the pro-nouns they/them

I live in Canada, and provincial healthcare covers breast reductions for physical reasons, but not for gender reasons as far as I can tell. I have considered top surgery but it is not covered unless you meet very binary-centred criteria that doesn't apply to me (eg. on T for at least a year, can prove you are ""living life as a man"").

I'm currently a DD cup or bigger (I am scared to figure it out). I'd like to ideally be an A or AA cup. I am not skinny and I have a bit of a belly, so I assume for cis people, including the doctor, this will seem ""non-proportional""/not ""aesthetic"".  I'm concerned the doctor will try to urge me to only go down to a B or C - something which I definitely do not want.

Any advice? I really want to know:

1) what to say to convince the doctor I ""need"" this reduction so that I get approved for health coverage (eg. what kind of back pain should I describe? what are the key words that will help me out here??)

2) how to convince the doctor to take me down to the literal smallest boobs possible, without making it about gender (for coverage reasons)

2019-11-06 03:24:59,dsagkh,0,1,"Hi all, just got a throwaway account to post here (not much of a reddit person, but excited about the community). I'm sort of in the midst of questioning my gender identity &amp; I guess I'm just curious if others have had my experiences/see if there are some common threads?  Anyway, this is kind of a long essay, so buckle up! I really hope some of y'all take the time to read it though. TL;DR older afab person identified as butch for a long time, now wondering about being genderqueer, would love to get advice and guidance (or even just support and recognition) from people who've experienced similar things!   


I'm afab and have been a ""tomboy"" pretty much my whole life. I'm in my early 30s and when I was growing up, in high school and college and such, i was exposed to binary trans identities (in fact, my best friend from high school transitioned FTM shortly after we graduated) and LGBTQ+ identities, but genderqueer/NB wasn't really a ""thing"" so much. In college I pretty comfortably fell into the box of being a butch bi woman, and gave myself permission to lean hard into the butchness after I graduated. Recently, i've come to realize, mostly from knowing and interacting with some younger queers, that if I had been born five or ten years later, and grown up with this current generation, that I think I would have identified as genderqueer. I feel like I fell into being a butch woman because that was the best word I had to describe myself at the time, but now maybe there are better words?   


Only now, have I started to really think about my relationship with my gender. At first I was like, I can't be genderqueer, I'm definitely a woman. But then I asked myself why I thought i was a woman (a question which, believe it or not, I have never before felt comfortable addressing) and I realized that the only times I really feel a strong allegience to my gender at birth are when i feel discriminated against or bullied because of my sex. Essentially, I only ever feel like a woman when I realize I'm afraid to walk somewhere alone after dark and my cis male friends aren't, or when I am at my job (in a very male dominated field) and someone makes a sexist remark. This last part is especially complicated for me, because this female solidarity has been very important for me in getting through the training process at my job and dealing with harrasment, and that kind of solidarity is something I wouldn't want to give up if I embraced a genderqueer identity. But, when I look inside myself, I really don't feel any particuar way about gender. I don't feel like a woman at all. I don't feel like a man either. If someone were to say to me, don't think about how others treat you, just think about yourself, how do you know you're a woman? My honest answer would just be, I don't.

After a few months of such questioning, I started experimenting a bit with presentation. I have always been quite butch, but never done much to hide feminine elements of my body, and whenever I've had to go to a formal event, I've worn a dress. In fact, I've always hated formal events because they require navigating female formal wear, which has always generated terrible feelings that I now recognize may have been dysphoria. This summer, i went to a friend's wedding in a suit and I felt glorious. I felt really handsome, like I looked good, a way I never feel when I wear a dress. After a month of experimenting with sports bras, I bought my first binder and found I enjoyed the look some days, but not others (I'm small chested to begin with, but the way the binder reduced my chest to nothing felt amazing on days when I wanted it). I also started letting my body hair grow out, which I've been less comfortable with (perhaps because it pushes my look over the androgenous line and too far into male territory?).   


Also an NSFW addition \[mods please tell me if this paragraph doesn't abide by group rules, I'll delete it--not meant to be explicit, just a part of my experience that's been really important\] I started having strap on sex, and holy fuck it's awesome. I've used a strap on before in several previous relationships, but its always been one that's colorful and not really dick shaped (#feminism lol). Even though I've been wearing it, it's always been for my partner's pleasure if that makes sense, just like, a more efficient way to use a toy, not a part of me. Well, this summer I invested in a dick of my own, that looks about the same color as my skin, and I...absolutely love it. Its not the only way I enjoy having sex, but using it, solo or with my (cis male bisexual) partner when I'm in the right mood has been amazing.   


So, all this to say, I'm excited about this journey. I still sometimes wonder if I'm allowed the label of genderqueer. Am I just a butch woman? I think a lot of this self doubt comes from being a bit older than most of the people I see using the genderqueer label, and from feeling like I just want to be me, and I don't want it to be like...a political label. Also, I am all for other people using they/them pronouns, but I just can't wrap my head around it for myself. Perhaps after 30 years of thinking she/her, it's just a habit I won't be able to break? I've heard from others that you don't need to use they/them pronouns to be NB or genderqueer, but it still really makes me sad when I'm in ""woke"" spaces and we go around and say our pronouns and I feel like saying ""she/her"" will imply to everyone else in the circle that I'm comfortable being a woman (\*yes I know about the Contrapoints controversy kicked off by a similar statement, and I'm in no way saying that pronoun go arounds are bad, just that for me in particular, at this stage in my journey, they are the opposite of validating!)

2019-11-06 14:53:40,dshd8w,6,18,"Preamble: 40 something Non-Binary AMAB.

Ive started my journey, and I fully accept who I am. So this weekend past, I went up to the mountains, and while there, tried my best to go into girl mode, something I have yet to do publicly by myself (alone).  I would say for the most part the experience was rather a mixed bag.

I started the Saturday in town (its relatively small) in Off Pink pattern Leggings, a really cute print top, and nike's. I was for the most part left well enough alone. I am by zero means passable in any way (Really I dont care if I am or not), but I tell you what, it was about the most wonderful feeling Ive had in my life ever. For the most part no one seemed to care or much less give it any attention. The girl in the toy shoppe told me my top was really cute and asked me where I bought it from (I told her Torrid). Then I wandered further into town, got some food (also again, no really odd looks or mean comments), and then continued shopping. While shopping of course, I did run into the local street preacher who was screaming his hellfire and brimstone at the people around. Now one look at me and I immediately got a ""Look at this abomination destined for the hell fires of satan and his lot."" Which I really did not care about at all. Screw this guy and his bullshit really.

Well after that of course I went back to my room, and daring all caution to the wind, put on my black maxi dress, hose, and flats, and then preceded to head over to the restaurant next door (I really wasnt much more brave than that). The hostess commented on my look saying it looked nice and then seated me. No problems still, started feeling confident actually. Ordered my food, and then went onward to eat. While eating however, I got a MAGA hat person who walked over to me and brazenly said that I was ""Whats wrong with America, and that I should go home and put some pants on. Trump is going to deport all you weirdo people, so we dont have to look at you. You make me sick."" Well that hurt my pride actually quite a bit, but I said nothing, ignored them, and continued eating. They flicked me off, told me to go $#%\^ myself, and then walked out (I guess).

So I finished my dinner, preceded to pay my bill and walk quietly back to my room. Again, no real issues there. Got to my room slinked into a nice blue and black lace nightie, picked up my copy of Walden (reading it again, after many years), and read till I fell asleep.

So the night went on, and I got up in the morning, got things together, and left the hotel (back in girl mode leggings and a really fem looking flannel) , checked out (the counter person stared at me a bunch and made faces), and then put the stuff in the car and drove down to the breakfast spot in town thats so nice. Walked up , asked for one seat, and the girl looked at me and said

""We dont serve you here."". She said.

I scoffed.

""Who do you think I am exactly?"" I said.

""You weird gay faggot types. You are welcome in our place."" She said.

Didnt get emotional, I just asked to speak to her manager, and politely asked why I could not be seated. The manager took one look at me and said nothing, and walked off (was wearing a JESUS gives tshirt). So I politely indicated I would leave a not so nice Yelp rating, carried on down to the local mcdonalds (they didnt care at all actually, girl was nice to me) ate a biscuit and left for homeward.

This was my weekend experience in a small town. Very hit or miss, and really the first time alone that I tried to express myself alone. Now to be fair Im 6'6 and about 275. Unlikely anyone is going to try starting anything with me. But still.

In addition to this I'm now starting to really struggle with the left over trauma from my father as a life long belief has been revealed a lie which further makes it difficult to express my identity to her.

 🐵this seems all over the place, and it kind of is, go to the next monkey if you wanna see the bit about me being nonbinary.

Recently I did a dna test to prove if I'm really any kind of native American, as my dad, throughout my life up until about 15, when i had to stop seeing him due to his malicious manipulative behavior and drug use, always said his real father was native American and so was his great grandmother.

 Taking a 23andme, I learn that i am not native. I'm snow white, 99% European. I was pretty heart broken to say the least because i was excited to be apart of a culture close to home. To have proof that I can participate in cultural activities without the threat of some one accusing me of appropriating and it also furthered proved how much more of a lie my father really was. I wanted to hold out hope that my father was an honest and whole person with me. That even though drugs may have destroyed his morality and his narcissism was destructive, that he still loved me. So this seemingly small detail i held onto for so long, is seriously messing with me.

after that night my mom asked this after noon, if ""I was over my identity crisis yet""
When i told her ""no"" she didn't give me time to explain and it wasn't as if i wanted to anyway, she would just blow me off. She asks ""why?"" And then proceeds to go onto a tangent or lecture about how genetics work, and if I had native heritage it would have been watered down. 
I understand this, but genetics isn't whats hurting me and i cant find myself to tell her the truth without fear that she'll use it as ammunition later.

She follows  ""that I should make my own identity"" but everytime I've confronted her before now, about my possible nonbinary identity, she has shut me down and said ""my dad broke me"" as if he had anything to do with how i want to define myself previously.

🐵
I believe I am Nonbinary. I find great discomfort in dressing as a woman or as a man. Ive always found comfort in the grey area of everything, I constantly project images of what i want to be onto Original characters i make, and most often these characters reflect an ambiguous body. Where they look some what feminine without losing the masculine edge. 

When I first started bleeding, a very kind teacher explained to me how important it was this was happening for me, how this was me blossoming into womanhood and growing into responsibility. I remember feeling nauseas about the statement ""you're becoming a young woman!"" For years after and i couldnt understand why. I remember vividly fantasizing about removing my breasts when i began to develop and running freely, shirtless,  i remember being 8 and fantasizing about running around shirtless with no Boobs, with many tattoos and having body hair. I thought it was the coolest thing ever.

In middle school, A friend told me about being a transmasc, how alot of my body discomfort lines up with that. Of course, were in middle school so much of the advice i got from friends was misguided, i played with the idea. My mom let me dress up masculine and then shredded me in the car about how ridiculous I looked and again, blamed my father when he wasn't a thought in my head When I made the decision to explore this identity.
I was stubborn and kept trying but as i grew up, being reffered to as male exclusively began to wear me down and make me feel wrong. 
I felt out of place again and started wallowing in  femininity again, falling into a really deep depression through out the rest of high school, up until senior year when I discovered Punk rock, its aesthetics, fashion and music culture.

I was and still am so freed by this.
there is SO so little gender expectation in their fashion. I have a Mohawk now, I wear ripped straight jeans and flannels, the bagginess of the clothes coupled with my usually strong physic with make up makes me appear very gender ambiguous and I've heard older generations in stores question what I was, or look at me quizically. Its shot up my confidence.
 (I am still depressed but luckily its for other reasons lol)

I hope one day i can make my body match my mind. Ive contemplated taking testosterone in the future because I like the body hair i have and would like more. I want to live my 8 year old fantasy of running shirtless in a feild one day.

So I may be something like non binary or something similar I'm not completely sure. Like I like just being me not female or male just me. I think about having both a vagina and penis. Like the thought of having both feels kind of nice I'm not sure. Like I would kind of be more neutral by having both genetialia.

But I'm not sure I haven't heard of anything like this. So I don't know and I was talking to a non-binary person briefly though I didn't talk about the thought of have both at the same time just that I thought of having a penis sometimes and sometimes not liking my breast or possibly not liking them I'm not sure.

I can't talk to the person though anymore cause I have a lot of problems and struggles and they got overwhelmed by the little bit I shared and didn't handle the situation well at all since they just ignored me and had the student affairs office talk to me at my college and then a week later there was a no contact order between us.

I don't really reach out to people in a way that allows me to be vulnerable because of being afraid of being abbandoned so the situation wasn't good for me it was really detrimental to my mental health. They should have handled the situation differently instead of just ignoring everything like talk things out and if they were worried they could of had someone to mediate.

I would have backed off if they would have said so. Its hard to open up anyways and I'm used to always being along always in my room alone. Being out of place not being connected I've always felt a disconnect. And sense of not belonging of being out of place.

I had a friend who is the who connected me with the non binary person. Since the friend was cis and the non binary person would of had more understanding. I'm not friends with that friend anymore since I fucked the friendship up like always.

All my life I've hated myself. I was never a girly girl, though I tried so hard to be, because I thought I had to be. I was born a girl, I had to be a girl, and I was tomboyish and hated skirts and my long hair being down, so I was a *bad* girl. Even when I learned about trans people, my brain still said *that's okay for them, but you are not like that, you will never be a girl but you still need to try because that's ultimately who you are.*

For Halloween I always chose male characters to dress up as and felt so good doing it, and it wasn't a big deal because it was Halloween. Girls are allowed to wear ""male"" things like jeans and sweatshirts and hoodies, because they're for everyone, not just men.

And then I discovered being non-binary, and for a while, I thought that was right. I tried different labels under that umbrella like agender or genderfluid, demi-whatever. They were okay for a while, and then they weren't and I'd move on to something else.

Two years ago, I started feeling male, like exclusively. Nothing other than male, he/him, felt okay, to the point where a single, accidental slip would make me crash for days. I chose a new name, started going by he/him, and it felt super great; I was so comfortable in that identity that I even felt happy being a more ""feminine"" man, wearing softer colors and prints, wearing leggings and skirts over my binder.

But now I'm just confused again. Trenders aren't real, but I wonder if I am, still. Am I doing this because I think it's a way into a community and I really just want to feel included for once, a girl pushing into a space she doesn't belong in? Am I actually a trans man who just presents a little more femme? Am I non-binary in some way but desperate for a definite label because that's the only way to make sense of myself?

I have top and social dysphoria really badly-- I hate my breasts and I hate being called miss/ma'am-- and I hate having a uterus, a period. My bottom dysphoria waxes and wanes. Sometimes I'd really rather have a penis, but sometimes I don't mind having a vagina.

I love my new name, but I don't know if he/him is weird because it's wrong or because I'm just not used to it. Some aspects of T terrify me, but others I really won't mind.

2019-11-13 01:11:20,dvjzde,0,1,"Hey all,

My name is Jamie and I am fairly new to this sub. I've lurked around here a bit as I have started on my ""gender journey"" (as I refer to it). I've read a lot of posts on here with people asking questions about their gender identity and have loved reading through all of the supportive responses. I know that one day I'll be posting my own (I have so many questions!), but for my first post I wanted to share an amazing experience I had this past weekend.

Lately, as I have begun to really question my gender identity and see myself as more gender fluid, I've begun to go outside of my house dressed either fully feminine or incorporating more feminine aspects to my outfit. I went to my first pride festival fully dressed three weeks ago and have begun adding more feminine touches to my work attire (more jewelry, basic make-up). These experiences (especially pride) have given me more and more courage to express my feminine side more outside of the house. Well, Sunday, I decided that I wanted to go out fully dressed for a normal day of shopping and errands with my wife. So, my wife did my full make-up (I'm still working on my skills) and I wore a nice cowl neck sweater and skinny jeans. I decided against wearing my bra because my wife still isn't comfortable going that far yet unless we're going to a place that we know is a safe space. 

Despite some nervous moments (and some general shopping aggravation moments), it felt absolutely amazing!! There were several moments when we were in clothing stores that I couldn't stop looking in the mirrors. I felt so happy being able to express my feminine side so openly. It really cemented some things for me in my mind about my gender identity and who I am. It also made me feel like I can do this more often, which is something I've been wanting to do for so long. 

Anyways, I realize that I've started to ramble, but I just had to express how great this felt to people who I knew would understand.

Have a good rest of your day!

I’m not like other girls. It’s a cliche, overused phrase, but it holds true for me in particular. I have only met one other woman who had a beard, and it was not nearly as robust as mine. I inherited the body hair of my mother’s side of the family, so unless I am giving myself a daily wax there is no way to avoid looking like a werewolf. Thus, I am keeping my beard as an artistic expression of my nonbinary, trans self. 

Why should I have to change my body to be who I am? I used to beat myself up over not being the petite epitome of feminine - an I mean literally hitting myself because I’m an emotional roller coaster who hated myself. But, I have since learned to love who I am as I am. I am enough and I don’t need to radically change or even mutilate my body to express my innermost feminine feelings.

Of course, this sets me apart from society as a whole. Before I moved to Portland, I became the local spectacle in my hometown of Syracuse just for wearing a skirt. I feel a lot of healing has happened since moving to the west coast where I can reflect my identity in my choices much more freely without consequences. 

Still, I am odd. That’s a given, being that I am schizoaffective as well. It makes life a bizarre roller coaster in addition to dealing with my identity issues. I like to describe my condition as being bipolar but the aliens are abducting me to save me from the CIA which is trying desperately to create a reality TV show about my life. I am often in an eccentric self-generated narrative about what I am doing at any given moment. My purpose is always changing, as is how I am perceiving different events.

Naturally, you can expect that this adds a lot of pressure onto me for fitting in. And that’s the thing - I don’t. In a society that is so radically split into dichotomous us vs. them thinking, I proudly stand out against the even background. I am a dodecahedron in a world full of square and round holes. I don’t have many friends, but those I do have are true companions that I genuinely am grateful to have in my life.

I am homeless, but part of that is by choice. My entire experience spiralling onto the streets has been a radical transformative event, and I continue to seek authentic human experiences to expand my horizons. By regularly being forced outside my comfort zone, I have been actively reconditioned to be much freer than I once was. My perception of self has changed to the point where I don’t need any reassurance from other people to find solace with myself of my actions. I am as I am, and I am happy and grateful that I get to be me; an alien on my homeplanet.

Basically, what I’m trying to say is that you should believe in yourself and go confidently about your day. If I can survive in this world on the farthest fringe of the bell curve, then that is proof that it doesn’t matter who you are or what you look like. If I can find happiness in a world that has been designed for people that are in no way like me, then that is definitive proof that happiness is completely self-defined.

So, I'm afab, femme, I would otherwise call myself a woman, and I have no idea how to speak about an aspect of myself I'm learning about because I do not know ANYONE who feels this way.

My feelings about this kink? that I am explicating are tied into 1.) What I am sexually aroused by/fantasize about and 2.) Another thing I have no idea what the term for could be - a strong desire to have a penis without distress or disdain for not having one.

In an expansion of those two points:

1.) I am very attracted to traditionally feminine presenting people with larger-than-average clitorises or penises. It is the most attractive physical appearance, to me. I want my body to look like those bodies and the idea of that is sexually arousing for me. Not enough to get surgery/use medications or hormones/use devices such as a pump to alter the appearance of my parts, but I have a toy that I have used before to simulate having a penis (for both sex with another person and for masturbation) and that was SO arousing for me. Me picturing myself actually having a penis and actually having sex with someone else or masturbating, with special interest invested in my feminine presentation with having a penis. The porn I consume is amateur stuff by feminine presenting people with penises or larger than average clitorises almost exclusively.

2.) Not only am I interested in having a penis within the context of sex, but I'd like to have it throughout my day. I'd like to pack publicly and not because that turns me on. Nothing about the idea of ""secretly having a penis"" is arousing to me.  That's the part that makes me wonder if it's a gender identity thing as well as a kink thing or a ""lifestyle"" so to speak even. I'd like to wear something that simulates a flaccid penis in the day time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do I feel dysphoric about not having a penis? Not at all. Do I feel like I have to do this to exist? Not at all. Is it something I want to be in a community to discuss this with other people or go out of my way to connect with others like this or dedicate a whole social media around (e.g. - a Tumblr or finding a hypothetical subreddit for or a Facebook group? Not at all.

And that's what makes it confusing to me. I'm queer and I'm femme and I have no interest in testosterone or dressing masculine or wanting to speak about this to people I meet with a label to identify me. That aspect of it confuses me. I'm not looking for community, I'm not looking for a surgical change or interested in manipulating my body to see more permanent changes or wanting this to be my existence outwardly nor always.

It's not even for sexual urination or public packing also. Just... I want to do that.

I want a penis most of the time almost like a natural part of my body. I don't feel incomplete without one. I don't want to transition to male or identify as masculine or any of that. I do, however, really want to know if there's a term for it.

I see myself as masculine and very much in favor of using he/him/his pronouns *(though I'm not opposed to gender-neutral pronouns such as they/them/theirs either)*.

**My question is a 2-parter...**

* Is it inappropriate to want to change the way I identify *(specifically for the sake of not being associated with the negative aspects of cis-male culture which I feel do not accurately represent me)*?
* If so, what gender designation *(ie. genderqueer, gender-fluid, agender, non-binary, two-spirit, etc)* would best fit my needs?

I'm a cis bi man in my late 20s going through a couple of rough bumps in life all happening at once. I'm getting through it, but it's all brought up a bunch of interesting questions. I've always hated the socially imposed idea of being a man. How I'm supposed to act, think, dress, behave around others, etc. I'm Latin as well and have been surrounded by machismo my entire life. Masculinity, machismo, male ego ... It's all incredibly ... distasteful. I've been conflicted my whole life between the need to conform to that social pressure and the deep feeling that those traits are not who I am. One related shitty experience has really made me question this and myself a lot more. This is a kinda long story but hang in there.

I went to visit a friend who means a lot to me recently. We went out to some clubs and drank a ton. At one of these clubs we met up with one of their very drunk cis female friends (Who I'll just call Cindy). Cindy happened to bring along another Latin guy who oozed that machismo. My friend and I want to dance but Cindy hears that and takes me by force to dance with her. I'm drunk and just want to dance with my friend, which we always trade of who is the lead, twirl eachother, etc. After some dancing Cindy stops me and asks ""are you into guys or girls"" ...  I respond ""Both"" ... ""No wonder cause you can't lead for shit"". Cindy continued to subtly question my masculinity the rest of the night. Saying things like ""you're a man you should be strong and take charge"". Yeah gross. Forcibly trying to jam me into a box of what a man should be like. 

Later that night the macho dude said some gross sexual comments to my friends so. There was an altercation and the dude was forced out of the club. We moved on to another club , with Cindy drunkingly following. My friend tries to keep Cindy busy while I chill with the SO, we're all drunk at this point. I don't remember saying anything bad, and that doesn't sound like me, but at some point my friend notices something with the SO and runs over. I overhear them yelling ""What did he say, did he say something to you, just tell me ... He's just another guy like the rest of them"". 

That hurt. That hurt a lot. I had to run to the bathroom and basically have a panic attack (which never ever happens). No control at all, bouncing of the walls, fetal position, the works. I felt  a mix of rejection, disgust with myself and what I'm *supposed* to be, misunderstood, labeled, hurt, etc. I talked it out with my friend way later and they apologized. I don't in anyway hold it against them and fully understand where it comes from. That night was just really terrible ... And I never want that to happen again. I don't want to be in that box anymore.

2019-11-23 11:25:05,e0gplo,6,1,"Hi all, just poking my head in here to see if I can find some clarity.

I'm AFAB and usually feel and present as female, but lately I've started noticing that some days I'll wake up feeling more like a boy or somewhere in between. These feelings can also sometimes be triggered by my environment or external stimulus - like if I listen to certain music or put on a certain outfit, I'll feel more like a boy based on how that music makes me feel that day/week/whatever. I'm sure that sounds kind of stupid, but it's hard to explain. I've also noticed some things from my teenage years that may point to me being gender non-conforming but it's hard to know if these things are actually connected.

Sometimes the way I feel changes a couple times in a day, but usually it stays one way for a long time and then changes briefly for a day or two before switching back. Rinse/repeat. Mostly I just end up with a really strong urge to present a lot more towards a male/boyish style than I usually would.

My issue is that I'm not sure whether this means I could be genderfluid or genderqueer, or whether it just means that I feel like presenting myself in a gender non-conforming way some days, and it doesn't have to do with my actual gender identity. It's super confusing.

I'm biologically female but I dont feel like I identify with one or the other. I'm pretty certain I'm under the non-binary umbrella somewhere and I'm just looking for some opinions. I've never liked terms that are female. Girl, woman etc. The word woman especially makes me extremely uncomfortable. I also dont like masculine terms either like boy or man. (Although saying boi as a joke will forever be funny to me) I like the idea of looking more androgynous, I cut my hair recently and I style it all kinds of ways that can make me look masculine feminine or in the middle too.

I just want to figure out what fits, so I can move on and continue to be myself. I dont like to stress on labels to much but just knowing what label fits is enough for me. So I can meet with people of a similar mindset and feel more of a sense of belonging.

I'm looking for media made about (and hopefully BY) gender nonconforming AFAB people, especially if they identify as women or do not desire transition, but still exist outside of the gender binary. 

I say it this way because I see a lot of differences in opinion on what ""trans"" is, if NB are trans, etc. I want media regarding people who grew up labelled as ""girls,"" but who continue to experience gender differently than their more conforming peers, but who do not identify as men. This can be by GNC women, AFAB NB people, whatever. I just want some media that I can relate to, because it feels lonely out here for people like me. 

I don't really see myself as trans. I questioned it a lot, and still kind of feel ""agender,"" but I look around at a lot of NB communities and it doesn't seem like me either. I get mistaken for a boy often, especially when I keep my hair short (I used to get mistaken for a boy several times a week, but I'm growing out my hair now as I do periodically). I wear clothes from the boys section, though sometimes I like dresses. Pretty much no make up, ""masculine"" interests, largely male friend group, etc etc. I wear suits and oxfords to interviews. I've always dreamed about wearing a 3-piece suit for my wedding, but I will be marrying a man (I'm pan), so unfortunately it may never happen... Basically, I'm gender nonconforming enough for it to cause some problems in my life, but its so difficult to find people who relate without trying to convince me I'm trans. 

A lot of the media I watch now is focused on trans NB people who are transitioning or femme NB people, or trans men (who I most relate to, but again, I don't want to transition as I have 0% body dysphoria). I tried really hard to relate with a lot of the NB people I knew or saw online, but I feel like I present more like a trans man half the time  I also relate a lot to butch women, but alas, certain lesbian sects of the internet are unwelcoming to bisexuals, especially those actively dating men.
