Me and my cousin are the same age (born 10 days apart actually!) and we’ve always been very close. 

They did very well in school, pursued and excelled @ dancing, as well as every other hobby they managed to pick up. I, however was the exact opposite. Being the same age &amp; gender, my parents often compared me to them, leading to lifelong feelings of inadequacy. 

I never let these feelings come between me and my cousin however, because for a while they were the only person who really ‘got’ me. I had always been a little bit of a weirdo. 

When I was around 16, I had confided in them that I was bisexual, genderqueer, &amp; would like to go by They/Them pronouns. They said they didn’t much understand, but they were willing to learn all they could to make me feel as comfortable as possible.  With their support, I was comfortable enough to come out to my friends, (who were all very supportive!) and parents who really just. Disregarded it. They’ve ignored any &amp; all pleas to refer to me by they/them pronouns, their reason being that they were sure I was going to “change my mind anyday now” (I’m now 20 &amp; still use they/them. Still haven’t changed my mind) I’ve reminded them many times of my preferences, but nothing’s ever changed.

That hurt me, but I was able to push those feelings aside. I really shouldn’t have, but I figured since they weren’t throwing me out or beating me up, I had it pretty good. 

Recently my cousin moved to New York to pursue a career in dancing. Since leaving their rural hometown they’ve become more comfortable in exploring their identity, and have also come out as gender queer earlier this month. They’ve changed their name to MJ, and also go by they/them.

I was very excited when I first heard, but got jealous/upset very quickly with how willing my parents were to adapt to these changes. They refer to them exclusively by their preferred name and pronouns, but always manage to ‘forget’ mine, even with reminders.

What should I do? Why do you think they’re doing this? How should I bring this up? Every time I feel like I’m ready to talk to them about it I feel like screaming and crying, because I’m just so frustrated, but I know that I probably shouldn’t lmao

TLDR;;
I’m genderqueer, &amp; have been out and proud for about four years now. My parents always ‘forget’ to use my preferred pronouns. My cousin came out as genderqueer earlier this month, and my parents never seem to forget their name/pronouns.

2019-04-02 11:27:16,b8hz36,0,1,"Hello,

I am a PhD student researching experiences of being gender nonconforming in childhood.

&amp;#x200B;

We are looking for **18-24 year old** **UK** volunteers who during childhood:

· Sometimes or always behaved in some ways that were more typical of children of the ‘opposite’ sex,

· For example, you might have preferred play activities or clothing more common for children of the ‘opposite’ sex

· It could have been a passing interest (e.g. six months) or long-lasting.

· You may have felt able to behave in the way you wanted, or felt that you had to hide it

&amp;#x200B;

This study involves completing a series of screening measures, after which you may be invited to take part in an interview about your experiences

Interviews will last approximately 45-90 minutes.

You will be compensated **£20** in cash or vouchers for your time.

I may seem new here, but over the last few years ive jumped from r/crossdressing to r/lgbt, to so many other related subreddits trying to figure out who I am. And in the last few months, I've figured it out, at least for the most part. (yay?). As I think I relate most closely with gender-non conforming, I've noticed something that bothers me more and more.   


I am AMAB, 24, gender nonconforming, and *straight*.   


*wait.. you're straight and gender nonconforming?*   
*yes.*   
*oh.*   
While I am probably blowing this out of proportions, i guess i need reassurance that people like me exist. That's it. I think some recent thinking and recent events has kind of put me at a boiling point. It's driving me nuts. Like even today, after my bookstore job, I see a book that catches my eye, and its ""Sissy: A Coming to Gender Story"" by Jacob Tobia. Maybe you've heard of it, maybe not. I give it a quick glance and i realize its all about gender conformity--and I'm thinking *yes! finally a book that relates to me!*  
*well.....kind of.*   
Im about 100 pages in, and yes, i should (and will) read the whole thing, but I've found out that the author is gay, and gender nonconforming. **And there's no problem with that.** I'm just a little frustrated because he doesn't really talk about experiences about trans and straight people, like me, and probably other people, and after i realize that, it just gets more frustrating. And don't get me wrong, theres lots of stuff I can relate to, and I enjoy his little stories so far, but it wasn't what i expected and It disappointed me. it just doesn't relate to me, because like many before me, I've been assumed gay by family, friends, strangers for expressing myself femininely. And I don't know if i'll ever be taken seriously by cis, straight women, or really, anyone... I was even nearly sexually harassed last year on a trip outside the country, and that scared me.   


TLDR kind of:   
So again, i guess what I'm asking is one, that if you gender-nonconforming, straight AMAB friends could come out and just say HI, so I know im not alone, and maybe even give me a piece of advice on what to do about being assumed gay, or how to do dating, or hell, just life in general. I need some reassurance.

I'm afab and genderqueer/nonbinary.  I'm very unhappy right now because no matter what I do I get read as female.

I wish I could wear my binder more, but it makes me feel cold and clammy, and like I said, it doesn't even make a difference in how people react to me.  Even in the queer community on campus (I'm a student) I often get read as female, and one of my nonbianary acquaintances has misgendered me multiple times, even though they know my gender and pronouns and I wear a pronoun pin.  It's like I'm not even nonbinary enough for other nonbinary people to recognize me.  I'm often afraid to go to places like the Pride center because I'm worried people will accuse me of faking, and I'm afraid to correct my professors on my pronouns because I tried doing so (politely) in the fall and as a result the normally friendly professor avoided speaking to me for the rest of the fall and the winter term.

I think I'm interested in looking into a small does of testosterone, but I'm so afraid that I won't like the changes it will cause.  I've made a list in my head of the changes I want and those I don't, but I know there's really no way to control what happens if I start taking it.  And while I want to appear more visibly not female, I'm also afraid to do so because of how trans people are treated.  I'm part of a fairly traditional martial arts school, and have been for five years, and I don't want to lose my place there because of medically transitioning.  The martial arts school feels like a second family to me.  I want to talk to a doctor on campus to get solid facts and advice about low dose testosterone, but I'm worried that because I'm so unsure I'll just be wasting their time, and when I tried to find out who to see and when to set up an appointment the doctor I was talking to started asking questions like ""did you know you were nonbinary when you were a small child?"" and when I told them I might have been, if I had known there was an option other than being a girl when I was that age, but didn't know it was, they seemed very judgmental.  I'm trying to look up information online, to learn more before I try to talk to a doctor again, but I keep panicking because I hear some people say that the changes from non binary transition are never permanent, so I feel like I'll never be seen as how I am, and I see other people who are so happy with how they look, and they look amazing, and I know I'll never be like them.",genderqueer,Not sure what to do,1554862805.0,"{'created_utc': 1554837605, 'id': 'bbc3eh', 'num_comments': 5, 'score': 13, 'selftext': 'Sorry that this is a bit of a rant.

I am a 35-year-old cis woman who is feminine in some ways (dresses, long hair) and not in others (I don’t wear makeup or uncomfortable shoes). I am dating and in my online dating profile I specified that I am primarily attracted to androgynous-presenting individuals. This is a relatively recent revelation on my part — aided in part by my online dating experience, which allowed me to look for patterns in who I was most excited to talk to. 

One of the people I am dating (43, identifies as genderqueer, prefers he/him pronouns) asked me about my attraction to androgyny. He said, “Tell me about that. What do you find attractive about androgyny?” 

I didn’t know how to answer the question — it felt like a quiz. I have never asked someone to tell me why they like busty women, or brunettes, for example. I tried to come up with a specific thing that I liked and it was hard to do so because I like both male-bodied individuals whose style is more feminine and female-bodied individuals whose style is more masculine....so it isn’t a specific characteristics or attribute that I am attracted to. I then tried to explain how maybe it’s that people who are queer or present as androgynous tend to also share a lot of the personal values that I do and so I have come to associate the characteristics together? I also thought maybe it was because I admire the boldness that it takes to wear whatever the fuck you want and not worry about fitting into a specific mold.

I recently started seeing this amazing girl who has been very supportive  of the fact that I am in the midst of exploring my genderqueerness.  After becoming intimate she asked me what sorts of things I need in the  bedroom in order to feel affirmed. I am AFAB but have always felt more  aligned with a  masculine identity. I experience dysphoria regarding my  chest but not always with my genitals. There are certain things I know  about how I want to be intimate with another person: i.e. touch my chest  at the top so it feels like a flat chest. But I'm still trying to work  out what other things would feel right.

I completely understand that everyone has a different experience, and  different interests sexually, but I've been really curious to learn more  about what other folks do to feel affirmed while having sex. I'm just  hoping for a little inspiration from others that will help me navigate  this for myself. 

So the following questions are mostly directed at anyone masc-of-center-- but I'm also happy to hear from anyone who has ideas. What  makes you feel like you in bed?

2019-04-18 19:12:27,beph41,17,119,"Thanks in advance for reading. I wasn’t sure where to put this. I ask, because I think this is me. 

I often wonder— are there actually a much larger % of people who are trans, or non-binary / binary nonconforming, gender-fluid, or something similar - but the social construct is so prevalent and those maintaining it work SO HARD to convince everyone they must be one or the other, that a lot of these people just kind of never think twice? 

They are comfortable enough, they’ve been assigned certain pronouns all their life so it’s just familiar at this point and if really pressed they’d be fine with any pronouns anyway, so it isn’t enough to really get them thinking or wondering more about it and digging deeper into their own gender and identity.

But it feels... not fake, but I’m worried it’s not valid. That I’m misinterpreting my own privileges for possible gender fruity... (i.e. the reason it doesn’t bother me if someone calls me “she” - I’m always going to be protected by patriarchy as a man who mostly fits the binary expectation). Other times I really do feel disconnected from one gender, especially a binary gender ID. 

There have been times where I’ve seriously wondered if I am trans but I’ve avoided it all my life until now because of all that binary sex/gender essentialist conditioning and it was never even a possibility I knew to consider until now, and now it feels way too late to transition anyway 😅

And then other times I’m like, no I’m a man —Yes I wear all my clothes from the “men’s” section because it’s familiar and comfortable, but outside a handful of things, I really I don’t have a lot interest in or identity connection to most “traditional” expressions of manhood or masculinity.

And then I realize... all that is made up and has nothing to do with gender or identity either and I could act like the most stereotypically masculine male man to ever Be A Man ™️ and still be non binary or trans or anything!

I’m afab, grew up in a very conservative fundamentalist environment, and went through an early and very fast puberty that gave me a very afab figure. I’ve always been kind of pigeonholed into this hyper-femme category, especially since I’m the only one in my large family who likes makeup, nail polish, and fashion. For a long time I wore rockabilly-style clothes, because my body is pretty hourglassy and I thought that was what I was “supposed” to wear.  I didn’t come out as bi for a long time because I was pigeonholed as “boy-crazy” (I’m really more like hypersexual, I just didn’t talk about the girls/gq folk!)

At 16 I cut my hair really short and absolutely loved it. I started experimenting with dressing a little more masc. I shied away from being too masc because I was still concerned with being “sexy” and really gauged that by male attention. Around that time I had my first (very closeted, very fucked up) girlfriend. (I went to a Christian highschool so all queer relationships were closeted, but this girl wouldn’t even admit we were together to me, even though we met up for secret cuddles and she got jealous if I talked to other people and she came to me for all her emotional support and we held hands constantly)

Anyway, time passed and I just kind of sucked it up, I guess. Got married to an abusive guy who really pushed me to be more classically femme. Had my first baby and discovered that pregnancy and breastfeeding gave me HELLA dysphoria. I had a breast reduction after my first kid weaned, but the surgeon refused to go as small as I wanted because she was worried about maintaining a feminine proportion :/. Cut all my hair off and wore really masc haircuts for a while, pissing off my ex’s family.

I’m in a much better place now. I left my abusive ex, am dating someone who’s genderqueer and bi and incredibly supportive, and just had my second baby. 

A few years ago my older child came out as a trans girl. In supporting her, I’m learning more and more about trans people, and I follow a lot of trans twitter. Recently two things really struck me: 1) a post that said “if your response to people transitioning is jealousy, you’re not cis” and 2) an article that said to pay attention to your gender euphoria, not dysphoria 

I am jealous of every transmasc person  I know. I have wanted a binder since I grew breasts (my dysphoria is mostly focused on my tits). Every photo I like of myself, since highschool, is a photo where I look masculine. I used to look at one of those photos and imagine a whole life where I was a boy.  I haven't used my feminine birth name in years- I go by a neutral nickname. 

But ""man"" doesn't really feel like the right identity to me. I can't tell if that's just internalized transphobia, really. I like my kids calling me ""mom"" and I still love dresses and I'm currently excited about growing out my hair, but I've been realizing that my predominant identity is more masculine and the femme stuff always feels kind of like an act. Like ""oooh I can trick these folks into thinking I'm a real girl!"" Right now, because my abusive ex wouldn't let me buy clothes and I've been broke since I left him, I just wear whatever clothes fit me and are cheap or free.

Tbh the identity that feels closest for me is slightly masc of centre. But being a fat, curvy mom with very big boobs, I feel kind of like I'm fucked. I'm also breastfeeding currently so I can't wear a binder. 

I can't afford therapy right now but I'm starting a new job soon and looking forward to finding a knowledgeable therapist to work with. In the meantime I'm just kind of flailing.

2019-04-22 19:57:14,bg6l6g,0,1,"I’m currently making a game where you can choose your gender, and one of these genders is gender neutral. 

I’m very uneducated in all things gender, and I want to make sure I represent gender queer people correctly in my game as I feel that it is very important that I do so. 

Currently if you are gender neutral your pronouns will be they/them as it just makes coding so much easier, but should I include a way for you to input your specific pronouns or is they/them good?

Also gender in my game is represented by a dictionary object formatted as such(this is a programming term but hopefully you can still follow along):
    {“gender” :  [“female”, “girl”, “woman”, “lady”], “pronouns” : {“pronoun1”: “she”, “pronoun2” : “her”}}
The example above shows the female gender, but the male gender is formatted the same way.

I’m currently making a game where you can choose your gender, and one of these genders is gender neutral. 

I’m very uneducated in all things gender, and I want to make sure I represent gender queer people correctly in my game as I feel that it is very important that I do so. 

Currently if you are gender neutral your pronouns will be they/them as it just makes coding so much easier, but should I include a way for you to input your specific pronouns or is they/them good?

Also gender in my game is represented by a dictionary object formatted as such(this is a programming term but hopefully you can still follow along):

    {“gender” : [“female”, “girl”, “woman”, “lady”], “pronouns” : {“pronoun1”: “she”, “pronoun2” : “her”}}

The example above shows the female gender, but the male gender is formatted the same way. 

I don’t know what I should have in the gender key for the gender neutral gender. Currently the gender neutral gender looks like this:

    {“gender” : [], “pronouns” : {“pronoun1” : “they”, “pronoun2” : “them”}}

2019-04-23 15:12:12,bghinx,0,1,"Hi there /r/genderqueer. My name is Wiggums, and I am figuring all of this out. Wanted to get my thoughts and feelings out there. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am MAAB, and was raised strict Roman Catholic. I fully left the church at about 16 (but I started getting disillusioned around 11), the biggest contributing factor was when my friend Mike came out to me as gay. I became pretty incensed, as he was one of the kindest, most selfless people that I had ever met, and because of the fact of how he was born, my family/religion would say that he wasn't as worthy of love as them, and that he was less than. I made an active choice at that time to be an Ally at that time, even though I didn't know what an Ally was (or indeed, if that was even a term at that time). I had dozens (if not hundreds) of heated discussions/arguments trying to convince my family/friends that LGBT (even before I knew what LGBT was) people were valid, and that they shouldn't have to hide, go against their nature and just live in a straight relationship because the Bible said that they weren't valid, and trying to convince them that it wasn't a choice...needless to say, it was like beating my head against a wall.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to present day (a little less than 2 decades later). My long term GF and I broke up, in August of last year, and once I got to a point where I was able to start dating again, I became willing to start experimenting with my sexuality (I have been questioning since I was about 14, but because of my upbringing and my family, I denied it and wouldn't allow it to be a possibility)...and realized that I am not straight. No idea what I am, not putting a label on it, because 1) I don't want to limit myself, and 2) advice from multiple people.

&amp;#x200B;

Now you may be wondering what that has to do with my gender, but it was an integral part of this whole story. Because of my willingness to allow myself to entertain the possibility that I was not a straight male, it opened up a floodgate, if you will. I then started talking to a coworker, we will call her K for the purposes of this story. K had shared with me that she was genderfluid and we had some conversations about what that meant, and how she felt and such. Some of the things that she said made sense and were familiar to me. I never fully felt like a man, but I knew that I wasn't Transgender, and I didn't realize that gender was like sexuality that it wasn't just M/F/T and that's it (even though I have a lot of NB and Trans friends and confidants...let's chalk it up to, I am oblivious and move on), so I never realized that it wasn't normal (if that exists...) for me to feel the way I did.

&amp;#x200B;

To get into how my gender presents, I basically feel like I am somewhere in between Male and Female most of the time, kind of in a gray area, if you will. There are swings at times to either more masculine or more feminine, with no rhyme or reason as to when, which, or for how long they will be for, or there will be elements of both at the same time. I don't have dysphoria most of the time (obviously not when I feel more masculine, because I am MAAB) but when I am feeling more feminine, there is some. It is not to the extreme, it is more like there is something wrong, and I just can't put my finger on it. Something is just off.

&amp;#x200B;

So, last night, I got my first bras and panties, which was anxiety provoking (I was standing in the aisle trying to figure out what sizes/colors/styles to get, and wondering what people are thinking of me when they walk by (I am confident in who I am, but still have fear about what people think). But, once I got home and put them on, I just felt so comfortable and at peace. When I have a bra on, it just feels so right, like I can actually breathe, and like I can fully be me.

Granted, I still know I'm not a man as these times are also accompanied by dysphoria about even stubble, but there are also times where I have no dysphoria about my facial hair yet I not only don't feel dysphoric about my breasts then, I feel euphoric about its development. So it almost seems like I might even have multiple nonbinary genders which are not strictly tied to the spectrum yet are also independent. \n\nSo, my question becomes, does anyone have any experience with multiple nonbinary genders? If so, do you have any advice or other experience you could lend me?"", 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Multiple nonbinary genders? (x-post r/genderfluid)', 'created': 1556367096.0}"

my main binder is a gc2b half binder in size XL. my boob size is right in their stated range of 38-40 inches for an XL. I have not measured my shoulders but I do know they are very narrow. the binder comes on and off very easily and does not compress the way I’d like. my chest doesn’t look flat so much as... lumpen? my boobs just look kinda smaller and not right, even under several layers of clothing. so I started to think I should go down a size or two but I’m hesitant about that because even the XL does not give me adequate boob coverage and with less material wouldn’t a smaller size cover my boobs less??

my job is very physical (I’m a cook) and my binder rides up way over my boobs at some point during my shift. 

I also have an underworks binder I’ve only worn once or twice because I hate the way the fabric bunches at the top but the fit issue is similar to what I’m experiencing with the gc2b. 

what are your thoughts?? should I try a different size or style or do I just have to live with it?

As we’ve gotten to know each other better she’s opened up to me about questioning her gender identity slowly over the past year. It seems to be growing more intense lately, she’s a very private person (has a really rough childhood and has trouble opening up) and doesn’t like to “burden” me with her problems, which I understand because I am similar about sensitive personal details. So whenever we talk seriously about her identity it’s pretty much always when she’s intoxicated. To clarify I NEVER push her to talk about something she doesn’t want to, especially when she’s under the influence, however occasionally after we go to bed and are alone when she’s drunk she talks more openly about her identity struggles. I don’t ask her questions I just lay there and hold her while she vents usually, and affirm that I love her no matter what. She’s always so worried that being anything other than female would be a disappointment to me, despite me consistently reminding her that I’m bisexual and I’ll love her no matter what gender. 

I was wondering if there was anything I could do as her partner to make her feel more comfortable, I’ve started trying to refer to her using more gender neutral pronouns and even changed her name in my phone to a gender neutral pet-name. However, while she’s postulated about maybe being nonbianary or trans (since she’s still trying to work that out) she hasn’t told me to change her pronouns. Is referring to her in more gender neutral terms overstepping? Is there anything else I should do as her partner to make her feel more comfortable and free to help find her gender identity?
