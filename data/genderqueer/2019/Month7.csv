2019-07-01 09:36:26,c7qj5x,4,10,"Hi, I started HRT with two puffs of T gel 2% everyday. My endo talked about doing three months like this and then go up (except if that's already enough for my body)

A bit of context: In my country, nonbinary is hardly a thing. I tested the water with my endo... she insist on me having top surgery everytime ( I am not interested and not in need) and have hard time to refers to me as a masculine person (it shouldn't matter but I pass most of the time too pre-t, so it's basically because she knows I am female and not her typical FTM patient)... soooooo

It's not like I have other options, I am happy I could start HRT even if I was clear with her that I won't be on T forever (she was hella confused).

&amp;#x200B;

I have no clue what low dose is for gel, I am not even sure if that's what I want. But I was wondering, what if I want to keep going with that dose because I feel good that way? is it good dose, in the sense is it healty? My endo thinks only in terms of what's ""normal man value"".

I am fine with the changes that a normal dose would give, so I'm not worried from that point of view, it's more that I know I can't pull the rope too much with my doctor, she reads these things like me not being sure - there is man and woman and one way to be - I guess that in the end she wants my money so I hope she won't refuse me as patient, because it's wiser to ask her this question. I just feel a bit lost, because in the mind of many doctors (and trans people unfortunately) there is ONE path to follow, so each part is a step toward the next and not itself an interesting journey.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I am just worring for no reason. Luckily my therapist is totally into gender fluidity, but we are both aware of the country we live in and the paper she made for me is all about me being a trans man, to help me have access to whatever I feel right for myself legally and medically. I present as such, and I don't feel it like it's a lie, but damn I feel the weight of ""keeping it to myself"" because the way I am. I am glad that some of my friends are coming around.

Hi folks! Just a quick story! So on a day to day basis, I dress and act pretty masculine, all things considered. I have very close friends who are aware that I like to crossdress, but aside from that small group of queer-friendly folks that I've known for a few years, the crossdressing thing is just a me thing. ""No one is home, I'm gonna get all dressed up and watch TV in my room"" kinda thing, or I'll go over to those friends' houses with my clothes, get all dressed up, come out and watch TV with them and have a girls' night. 

&amp;#x200B;

Except last night, on the Fourth of July, I went to a work party. I want to preface this story by saying, unlike in most jobs I've had, I genuinely get along with and love all my coworkers. They're good people. I trust all of them a ton. So two of my three bosses, my office's secretary, and probably 12 coworkers and I are all pretty drunk talking about work. I have no idea what the context is, or even if there was context beforehand, but I basically went up to the secretary and was like ""Hey wanna know something wicked personal about myself?"" and she was like ""Fuck yeah I do."" And, I showed her my pictures. This was already a weird choice. I was drunk, not sure what I was thinking. She was supportive of it and we talked about it and some friends she has. This is the part where, logically I should have said ""Cool, an ally."" and then not told anyone else. Except I was drunk so I did. I basically showed everyone in management because they're all who I'm closest with. They all seemed to be supportive, but I can't remember for sure because, let me reiterate: I was, REALLY drunk. Because I'd never tell anyone this otherwise.

&amp;#x200B;

So now everyone in management is aware. I'm giddy and stuff because I'm like ""Wow it feels kinda nice not having it be a secret, so cool. Lookit all these friends.""

&amp;#x200B;

And the next day rolls around. I wake up this morning, sober(and hungover) and immediately I'm ashamed. It's not that I'm ashamed of being into the culture, I'm not. I was embarrassed that I, in my drunken stupor, thought it'd be appropriate to run around my boss's house with my phone and show them what I do on the weekends like someone might talk about their weekend golf trip. I see my boss in the morning, I smile, say hi and carry on with my day like last night didn't actually happen. I kind of pray to myself no one says anything. Before my boss goes home, she comes up to me and says ""Hey, uh, before you go, can you check your cubby?"" and I say sure. The cubby is where we put paperwork that needs to be signed, stuff like that. Weirdly, I was scared it'd be some kinda harassment paper or something. Like maybe last night was SUPER uncalled for and someone complained. More embarrassment.

&amp;#x200B;

The shift ends. I clock out. I go to my cubby. What do I find? 

&amp;#x200B;

My boss bought me makeup. 

&amp;#x200B;

It was like, the coolest way to tell me she was an ally. I couldn't believe it. This boss, of all the managers, is the one I'm never sure like, how she feels about me. I'm kind of a spaz at work, and my personality is probably awkward for people. But getting the makeup from her was like. I dunno. The confirmation felt insane. What a girl. I'll never forget this.

I see my boss in the morning, I smile, say hi and carry on with my day like last night didn\'t actually happen. I kind of pray to myself no one says anything. Before my boss goes home, she comes up to me and says ""Hey, uh, before you go, can you check your cubby?"" and I say sure. The cubby is where we put paperwork that needs to be signed, stuff like that. Weirdly, I was scared it\'d be some kinda harassment paper or something. Like maybe last night was SUPER uncalled for and someone complained. More embarrassment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe shift ends. I clock out. I go to my cubby. What do I find? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boss bought me makeup. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like, the coolest way to tell me she was an ally. I couldn\'t believe it. This boss, of all the managers, is the one I\'m never sure like, how she feels about me. I\'m kind of a spaz at work, and my personality is probably awkward for people. But getting the makeup from her was like. I dunno. The confirmation felt insane. What a girl. I\'ll never forget this. Everyone\'s confirmation was cool enough but to be gifted something was surreal.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Wholesomeish story about me coming out to my boss.', 'created': 1562421499.0}"

I've always been attracted to people of all genders my whole life but my two LTRs were with men and ery heteronormative relationships where I just suppressed these other sides of me. I got out of LTR w a cishet man last year (we were engaged). I have dated/done physical stuff with girls in the past but never slept with a woman and I want to explore this but also I'm REALLY scared, I feel like I am now too old to be a virgin and I'm terrified of judgement! I tried to speak to one girl on a date about this earlier this year, after learning all this she said I was ""trying things out"" and said she wouldn't be my ""phase"" which really knocked my confidence.  


In terms of me, I feel very happy on my own at home not assigning myself a label and just enjoying the experience of being me. I've been thinking of myself as ""non-binary they/them"" this whole year (kind of as a trial) and it seems to fit. I would like to come out to people in my life - or at least find community- however and I'm not sure these terms are correct.

I wear a lot of mens clothes and no make-up, but I do have long hair and a very curvy typically ""feminine"" body (although weirdly since I stopped thinking of myself as a ""woman"" I've found it easier to explore my feminine side and have been enjoying skirts, make-up etc) ""They/them"" feels safe, sometimes she/her feels like an attack but mostly it just feels uncomfortable or not as correct as ""they/them"". I DO like she/her in romantic contexts (i.e. on dates). growing up I was always ""tomboy"""" etc I have a very assertive/dominant personality which resulted in my being the ""alpha male"" and so on. previously I liked the acknowledgement of the ""masculine"" energy I possess although I think now it was messy to characterise my personality that way and probably there was underlying confusion as I never felt like I adhered to the concept of woman.  


I would really like to find other people/community to talk to about this but I don't know where to start and all of my friends are white cishet people so I genuinely don't know how I would even broach the topic!

 So I'm feeling absolutely terrified to post this, but I know I need to at least tell somebody. 

Okay, so I was watching a documentary about trans youth in Los Angeles. I've been repressing my gender identity confusion for a long time. Then, it hit me. It hit me that I might be a more effeminate male. I burst into heavy sobs, until I couldn't cry anymore. 

. I'm getting a bit emotional writing this, right now. I've always had body issues and puberty seemed to amplify it. I hit puberty when I was nine and remember feeling frustrated that my breasts were beginning to grow. I was so angry that I felt ""out of control"" of my body and I was angry with my mother. I thought puberty and becoming a ""woman"" were ""scary"" things that happened to adults, not to a nine year old who still watched ""Little Bear"".
 I just never felt I belonged in my body, male or female. I feel lost and it's still hard to look in the mirror and often feel disassociated from my body. I know there's a good chance I may be male, especially if these thoughts aren't going away. I keep gaslighting myself and telling myself that I'm just ""mentally ill"" or ""crazy"" (narcissistic family members loved to use these phrases towards me generally, with my reactions to the abuse or calling out the past abuse) or that its just my body image issues. I'm also a survivor of sexual abuse throughout my childhood and adulthood and I know that can warp ones sense of identity and cause victims to question our very core of identity.

 I'm struggling to come to the conclusion whether my issues are trauma/body image-related and/or related to possible gender dysphoria. I've struggled with depression, eating disorders, self-harm, among other serious mental health issues. I'm in therapy now and I see her in two days. I definitely need someone more trauma and gender-focused. I've doubted myself for a long time, with a mixture of my own thoughts and what others tell me.

 I've met very few people who are both trans and survivors of sexual abuse in-person. Basically, I'm feeling very confused and this is my first time writing about it.

at this point i feel much more at ease in my body through lots of therapy! i wear clothes and present myself in a way that feels right for the day, either more masc or more femme depending on some feeling that i can’t identify. but i have not brought up the gender questions with my therapist yet because im scared. i also don’t want to claim something that isn’t mine, and i remember one time trying to talk to my partner about this and she told me to “be careful because gender queerness is a real thing that people experience” and i totally understand that. but is it a thing that i experience? who is to say! that is why i am turning to reddit.

&amp;#x200B;

So here it goes.. I know I'm either Bigender {female and male at the same time, all the time} or ftm Transgender, but I don't know which.

&amp;#x200B;

I often feel like the Bigender thing is just an attempt at not transitioning because I'm scared to. I wished I had a penis rather than vagina for quite a long time now, always fantasize about being male, prefer he/him pronouns, and if I had a choice to choose between female and male I'd ALWAYS choose male with no exceptions.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I'm not masculine. I'm a **very** feminine person, I don't enjoy most if not ALL manly things. Pastels, fashion, cute things, rainbows, animals, flowers, nail polish, chokers, I love it all with a passion. I like having a feminine look to me, and my dream is to be a feminine male. I don't want, and never plan to, get surgery or take meds to alter my body. Hell, I don't even like makeup because of the idea of changing my appearance to one that isn't me just doesn't feel quite right. I appreciate the body and face I was born with, and don't want to alter them to the point where it's not even recognizable as me anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I might be ftm Transgender, but I don't know. I don't have serious pains to be male, occasionally get some minor body dysphoria but by morning it's all normal. I don't hate my body or face, although I wish I had shorter and more man-like hair. I don't necessarily mind being called a she/her, but I don't prefer it or particularly enjoy it either.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have any problems with my chest, as it's quite small and could easily be covered with baggy clothes if I did want to hide it, which I often don't care to. I also don't have a huge problem with my vagina, however I would much prefer to have a penis and the idea of intercourse with a vagina doesn't seem enjoyable to me. The main thing I hate is my long hair, I wish I could cut it into a gender-neutral if not more man-like hairstyle. I love my girly face but I wish I had a slightly, just slightly, more gender-neutral face.

&amp;#x200B;

When I imagine my future if I was a feminine male, I'm full of joy and the idea of it is **amazing** to me. I don't quite enjoy the idea of a future being female, though. I mean, I guess I could tolerate a future as a female, but it's NOT the preferred option in the slightest. I have a slight annoyance to females, even if they're doing nothing wrong, which I think might have something to do with my dislike to being female. I've always wished to have male friends, I don't know why but the idea of female friends seems kinda uninteresting to me and honestly kinda annoys me, once again might be linked to my dislike to being female. {Not trying to be sexist, just saying that for me my gender preference for friends would be male.}

&amp;#x200B;

Hi! Female-bodied person here. I've felt this way about my gender all my life, but only recently have I realized how important this is to me.

I have no connection to my female body. I don't really care what body I have, because for me, expressing gender has is just a masculine/feminine thing.

* But since my body is female, it makes me feel like a fraud to present myself as male/use male pronouns. I feel like I *have* to tell people upfront, especially online, that my sex is female, because otherwise it feels like I would be lying to them; even though this isn't the case at all. I'm well aware that my sex isn't all that important in the grand scheme of things, but it just feels wrong to call myself/ask others to call me one thing when my body says another.

However, I prefer being seen as a male, both on and offline.
Masculine pronouns (He/Him), and being called ""cute"" or ""handsome"" give me euphoria. Since I do not experience much physical or social dysphoria, calling myself trans would feel wrong to me. I have no desire to change my sex/body/genitals, because I've just accepted that this is the body I was born in, and that's okay. 

Overall I'm indifferent to having a female body. Except when I feel the pull to present as male.

I've been identifying as bi man for over a year now, but I find that now the ""man"" part of that label is chafing me. Hear me out, and please forgive me if I ramble.

When I first came out as bi, I felt several senses of liberation, primarily that I no longer had to feel guilty for feeling attraction to men, but it also felt like a free pass to engage in gender nonconformity as a gay man. I didn't feel like I was locked into the strict ritual kf masculinity any longer. ""Who cares if rosé moscato is gay, *I'm* gay."" I started pursuing drag with an interest that was previously reserved only for Halloween, and I adored the attention of being told what a beautiful woman I made. My partner (now ex) told me that I was possibly experiencing gender euphoria, but I brushed him off at the time.

What has had me ignoring these feelings for so long has been the fact that I really don't hate being a man. I started lifting weights a few years ago and I put on twenty pounds of muscle, and it's done wonders to my body image. I like being strong and muscular, and if I'm insecure about anything it's that I'm slightly short.

Where I start to dislike the idea of being a ""man"" is when I'm perceived and judged for being one. Criticisms leveled at men or maleness or masculinity make me feel a very strange sense of guilt and confusion.

Now I don't mean this totally literally, I don't have *that* much of a persecution complex, but I wonder if this means something or if it's just conceit.

2019-07-17 05:52:26,ce8s0r,6,3,"hi! I'm stuck in a bit of a tough situation and was wondering if anyone had any advice/similar experiences. i've known for years that i was non-binary but have never felt comfortable coming out to anyone, even this is the first time i've written about it where people can see it which is kinda important to note here. Anyway, here's my dilemma: 

A few months ago i started going out with this boy who i'd been friends with for a while, super sweet and very accepting of the fact that I usually lean towards liking girls. He's cis and straight and hasn't really had any experience with the lgbt community and has a pretty limited understanding of it all but despite this, he's never once shown any intolerance towards the community and seems pretty openminded about it. I love this guy, and he treats me with constant kindness and adoration and its something i dont wanna risk losing, but hearing him call me his girlfriend and say im a pretty girl really fucks me up because i know i should appreciate it but in the end it just makes me really uncomfortable.

Anyway, here's my dilemma: \n\nA few months ago i started going out with this boy who i'd been friends with for a while, super sweet and very accepting of the fact that I usually lean towards liking girls. He's cis and straight and hasn't really had any experience with the lgbt community and has a pretty limited understanding of it all but despite this, he's never once shown any intolerance towards the community and seems pretty openminded about it. I love this guy, and he treats me with constant kindness and adoration and its something i dont wanna risk losing, but hearing him call me his girlfriend and say im a pretty girl really fucks me up because i know i should appreciate it but in the end it just makes me really uncomfortable.

2019-07-18 04:26:20,cenqol,2,2,"So I'm 16, and for the past maybe 3 months or so, I've been seriously questioning my gender. This wasn't exactly a thing that came as a surprise to me when it started. The first time I ever heard about trans people existing was when I was 8 or so and saw an episode of American Dad where one character had transitioned to become a woman, and for some reason that I didn't understand the whole idea was something I gravitated towards (despite the actual depiction of the trans woman being a transphobic one, but I was an 8-year-old kid who didn't even know it was a possibility to not identity with your birth gender, so I didn't know that). But after watching that episode I ended up looking into it at that age, learning about it, and (although admittedly this only lasted a few days) I kinda was fixated on that idea, and even after that short period of time, every once in a while that intrigue popped up again.

Ultimately, I forgot about all of this until I started actively learning about the LGBT community, past the LG part. For a while, I never saw myself as part of that community (maybe this was because at the time I had barely hit puberty, if at all, and didn't know anything about myself). But around 8th grade I started to realize I might be bisexual, and I slowly over the course of a couple year came to the conclusion that I was, in fact, bi once I had my first crush on one of my best male friends. This ended up being not a fun crush, but that's neither here nor there. But still, even since then there have been times where I've been skeptical of myself and being bisexual (rn I'm once again, very certain I am, and at least with this I don't think I have anyway to telling myself I'm not anymore).

After realizing I was bisexual and for the most part coming to terms with that, I was watching a lot of anime. One thing that I noticed is that I always gravitated towards trans or crossdressing characters. At first, I thought it was just maybe a sexual thing, but slowly, overtime, I started to realize I was more able to connect with them than I had previously thought. I started thinking more about being a girl, what it would be like, and being happy at that thought. I started telling my closest friends what I was thinking about after a few weeks of it being something I got fixated on again. Then, about a week later, I painted my nails for the first time, loved it, and decided that I'd keep it on for when I went to school. I was met with almost no negative reactions. Everyone I talked to thought it was great (funnily enough, most of the girls I talked to said they were jealous because I somehow was able to paint them better than they could, which I find hard to believe but the amount of people that said it is hard to deny, but that is neither here nor there). The worst I ever got was a snicker about it, not to my face, and one kid asking if I was gonna spread the gay agenda if he signed my petition to be a candidate for my student Senate after he saw them. Then, in private, I started cross-dressing and it's been something I've certainly enjoyed doing since I started.

But I've still had my doubts ever since. Like I'd ask myself ""what if this is all just fabricated and fake?"" (Something which I incidentally ask myself about a lot of things I believe about myself). Then there's that I don't really feel any dysphoria either. The most I've felt was feeling weird not having nail polish on at a given moment, or when I'm cross-dressing and clock everything that makes me not look feminine. But this only happens when I'm not wearing clothes meant for men. If I'm wearing clothes like what I just normally would wear, I don't feel any dysphoria about my body whatsoever. I'm not necessarily not ok with being male, but I feel like there is also another part of me which is definitely more female.

So, lots of exposition, but now I can sorta get to the main point. I don't fully know all that much about being non-binary, or genderqueer, and it's hard to find good sources of information that aren't from anti-sjws, which is where it seems most get their info on the topics. I've been thinking that where I really belong is somewhere with a non-binary identity, but I want to know what other people think, based on what I've said, and also if there are any resources that are good to try to read more and understand better and hopefully be able to better understand myself.

If you read through this whole thing, I applaud you. I hope that someone might be able to help out with some resources. Maybe blogs, YouTube channels, YouTube videos that are really good.

As soon as I knew that's not the way it's meant to be, I skyrocketed and became my own person. I wear clothing from both departments, have short hair, and just refuse to give any fucks.

I started really questioning my gender identity not too long ago, and had a few phases throughout puberty where even being in a women's body felt kind of wrong. There are days where I want to be kind of feminine, and days where I'm feeling masculine.
I get that few people will take me seriously outside of this lovely sub, so I'm scared to say anything to anyone.

2019-07-19 03:21:29,cf2deh,3,3,"I'm a hetero cis AMAB, I know that much, I suppose.  But beyond that... I don't know most of the time.  My problem has always been that I like and am drawn to a lot of traditionally ""feminine"" things (cute clothes, dresses, skirts, jewelry, nail polish, makeup), and I'm not really interested in lots of the things males are ""supposed to like"" like working on cars, outdoorsy stuff, sports, grilling, hiding your feelings way way down, and so on.

I don't think I'm trans, in the sense that I don't really wish my body was different overall.  And honestly, the thought of ""being a woman"" doesn't really fit better with me than ""being a man"" does.

But does it make sense for a straight male who's not trans to say they're genderqueer?  I feel like some people would think I was intruding on their space, that I don't fit anywhere in LGBT land since  I'm not gay and not trans.

And I couldn't easily give someone a short definition of what it means to be ""genderqueer"".  Is that different from being gender-non-conforming, or nonbinary, or neutrois, or androgyne, and if so, how exactly?

Sorry if this is confusing.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm AFAB and I tried T for a while,  and some of it was amazing like the deeper voice, musculature, the  thought that i'd one day have a ""male"" fat distribution pattern. Some  things I was ambivalent about like growing thicker peach fuzz that would  one day be full blown facial hair. Then some stuff i actually really  hated--smelling like a ""boy"", the idea of one day going bald, being seen  as a ""Man"" despite feeling really attached and formed by my experiences  as an AFAB person. I also got scared because i feel like i'm less  likely to experience physical violence if i'm a ""butch lesbian"" rather  than a feminine-presenting guy. I'm also really upset that i'll be very  short and small forever if i ever used T again. That height dysphoria  never lightened up. I get a lot of compliments for being so small and  slender as a woman, and that positivity wouldn't translate as well if i  were perceived to be male. I'm scared of having to tell my extended  family i'm trans because i'll be very obviously going through a male  puberty. Finding people to date is also easier as an AFAB person mostly  into dudes, though it's hurtful that i think most cis men i date only  humor me and don't actually see me as anything but a woman with a  testosterone-induced deeper voice.

The  conclusion i've reached lately is my life would have been 100000%  easier if I took testosterone before my ""girl"" puberty. But that didn't  happen. So here i am... just sort of paralyzed. There are some days  where I feel like I will literally die if i don't medically transition,  but most days it's a relatively more manageable anxiety/depression.  There are days where I can look at my body and feel bummed then days I  look at my body and can't sleep i'm so disturbed i don't look like a cis  guy. I took testosterone, but only for maybe 4 months. I still look  like a cis woman if i style myself feminine, though my voice is now deep  enough to turn some heads.

I'm  definitely going to get top surgery if i can ever afford it. So much  emotional pain is centered around my chest. Though there's also a lot of  pain around my feminine thighs. i want to die every time i remember  that if i don't transition, i'll age as a ""woman"" and that's the most  terrifying thing in the world to me. I'm terrified of being a middle  aged woman and having lost out on being a young man. i'm also scared of being a middle-aged woman simply because this world can be cruel to women viewed to be beyond their ""childbearing years"".

I've  been trying to ride somewhere in the middle this past year or two. I'm  not binding (it hurts my back) but dressing and styling myself as very  masculine. I'm not on testosterone anymore, but it's left my voice very  androgynous/learning a bit masc of center. I sort of knew this  beforehand but didn't understand til i starting living it--*people can sometimes get really angry/upset if they can't tell if you're a boy or a girl*.  People treat me worse now that i'm not a cis-het passing AFAB person.  Sometimes I get asked on the street if i'm a man or a woman.

I accidentally got myself involved in a relationship problem between my best friend and their boyfriend and, being someone who has no relationship experience in my life, I don’t know what to do or how to help. 

My friend (R), who’s biologically a male, has told me they identified as gender fluid and wants to go for an androgynous look, but their boyfriend (M) isn’t comfortable with that, so their gender and desire to go androgynous was kept a secret for the longest time.

2019-07-24 19:23:38,chcopp,7,5,"I  haven't been putting much thought into this until a few weeks ago when I started going on Tumblr, but I've been thinking about it a lot lately.

I don't know if I'm a cis-female who's simply a tomboy, or genderflux.

I mean, ever since I was little, I was always a bit of a tomboy. I never liked makeup or dresses or anything like that. I never had dolls or wanted to be a princess or anything like that. I also liked being called a tomboy and identified myself as one.

But as of late, sometimes I feel 100% female but other times I feel mostly female, or at least I think I do. I use she/her pronouns, I like to label myself as a female, I also often call myself a woman, but there are some days where I feel like a demigirl?

Before I discovered genderflux, I entertained the idea of being a genderfluid demigirl, as in I switch between being a female and a demigirl. The thing is though is that sometimes it felt right, but other times not quite?

Sometimes it feels foreign to label myself as genderflux/genderfluid/demigirl, but other times (or even at the same time) I feel okay towards it? Or even natural?

2 days ago when I discovered genderflux , it was a mix of ""that's what I'm feeling? that's my possible identity?!"" and feeling really intimidated by it. Like, I felt stressed about it. It made sense but it also feels kind of scary? I'd even say it felt wrong?

So I don't know if that means I'm cis, or if it's just me being afraid of the idea of being nonbinary and being in that minority.

It feels intimidating for me, to be completely honest. Like, I feel like it would be weird to identify as such or something. Like I would stick out like a sore thumb amongst others.

And I'll be honest, sometimes I feel intimidated by this because the people I look up to and admire (my favorite YouTubers, artists, etc) are cis as far as I know and for some reason the idea of being something else scares me?

I mean I'm already asexual so I'm apart of LGBT I think, so I guess it wouldn't make much of a difference.

I wanna say that I should wait and give it time and not worry about it and eventually I'll realize my identity.

But I'm really impatient.

I also had a few moments of me feeling like a guy, I think, so maybe it's genderfluid?

The thing is with being afab is that I don't know if I disagree with being a female, or disagree with the stereotype of being a female. I *hate* the word gender roles with a passion because I feel like it's telling me I'm expected to be the ancient world view of what a woman should be. You know, being submissive to men, taking care of the household, never going outside, having kids, being a mother...the idea of it makes me want to vomit my guts out.

And the thing is also is that I don't believe that all feminine men are nonbinary or gay, or all tomboys are nonbinary. 

And honestly, I'm really really worried that I want to be nonbinary just to get attention and support or something.

It's also worth noting that I have OCD so maybe these are just symptoms of it?

Hey darlings,

I've been experiencing gender dysphoria for a while now, and I don't feel entirely feminine or entirely masculine. I've been talking about it with my lovely boyfriend for a few months now, and we both think that I'm genderqueer/ non-binary. However, I feel awful because I really can't ever come out. I come from a homophobic and transphobic family background and I couldn't even come out as bisexual when I was 14 without getting physically attacked. However, I can't leave my family and cut them off; my parents have mental health issues and I have to take care of them. I'm not sure what to do because I don't think I'll ever be able to truly live as my authentic self. Unfortunately, its been impacting very negatively on my mental health. 

Has anyone ever been in a similar situation? Has it ever gotten better for any of you? 

I would love some advice from veteran queers. Or just supportive ones. Thank you!

2019-07-29 23:06:09,cjizzd,9,19,"Hi. So, here’s the backstory: I came out as bi/pan to some friends in 2010, to my family in 2014, and in 2015, after dating a trans/nonbinary person, I identified publicly as gender nonconforming. This came after discussing gender with them, and really connecting with their story. I’ve never felt any specific attachment to my “maleness” as the standard identifiers just don’t resonate with me. Often, the things people identify as “feminine” are closer to my heart. I grew up being told the things I liked were too girly or exclusively feminine (singing, drawing, poetry, stuffed animals, expressing emotions in a healthy way). I had to force myself to care about football. 

I also always loathed gender norms, and I’ve always believed there’s just way too much fluidity for there to be a binary. 

Anyhoo, I refer to myself as male quite often, unless I’m specfically given the option of choosing “gender nonconforming.” And as for pronouns, I often default to he/him/his even though I frankly prefer they/them/their. It’s been a long battle complicated by intense body dysphoria, depression, living in a very red state, etc. I have put off really thinking about it over the last few years because I hate my physical appearance and feel like I can’t be happy/content while living in this shitty dumpster fire of a body. So really wrestling with my gender expression/identity has been an afterthought until recently. 

My issue is I feel like a fraud. I feel like I should just own one lane or the other. It feels like I’m taking up space from people who actually belong. I now find myself feeling like I can’t be happy(ier?) until I sort this out. Hence...

2019-07-31 03:44:53,ck2y5x,1,5,"We love gender when it's fun and light. We love to explore it and find new ways of thinking about and embodying it. We like identifying with both things that we feel very strongly about that took a lot of difficult introspection to discover, and we like to identify with things that are silly and ephemeral that we just like for the time being. We like to identify with things that we seem to have been born with, things we seem to have been conditioned to be, and things we have chosen to be for ourselves.

We LOVE meeting someone new, hearing their pronouns, seeing how they behave, what they express, how they dressed themselves, and their labels and suddenly having this synchronicity reveal itself where it all makes sense. We really feel like gender is like currency - If you believe it's worth a dollar, and I believe it's worth a dollar, what is it worth? What if everybody only believes there are two or three or four genders? What if people believe there are infinite possible genders? We have been in spaces where people all allow one another to choose all kinds of identities, and all of a sudden the become REAL because we allow ourselves to notice people representing themselves! It's amazing! In these spaces, gender is light, and fun, a tool that people use to better understand and better express themselves. It's not heavy, not a thing that people use to assess one another's validity, not a thing that people use to try to influence one another's behavior. That people can stand in these spaces, and then go on and claim ""But you just can't \*invent\* genders any time you want!"" is something that I simply cannot understand because we feel like we tangibly see people (Cis people too! Cis people experience gender milestones in life, and make decisions about how they want their gender to actualize!) inventing and reinventing their genders every day. There are a couple of instagram accounts I can think of where people literally post themselves with new genders all the time--what more evidence is needed?

At the same time we're trying to make gender just seem more light and lower stakes, we absolutely get how some folks are trying to make their gender IDs seem MORE serious to cishets while we're out here trying to make gender seem silly altogether.

What if everybody only believes there are two or three or four genders? What if people believe there are infinite possible genders? We have been in spaces where people all allow one another to choose all kinds of identities, and all of a sudden the become REAL because we allow ourselves to notice people representing themselves! It\'s amazing! In these spaces, gender is light, and fun, a tool that people use to better understand and better express themselves. It\'s not heavy, not a thing that people use to assess one another\'s validity, not a thing that people use to try to influence one another\'s behavior. That people can stand in these spaces, and then go on and claim ""But you just can\'t \\*invent\\* genders any time you want!"" is something that I simply cannot understand because we feel like we tangibly see people (Cis people too!

2019-07-31 21:59:08,ckf4t5,25,30,"Okay, hey, I'm gonna try to keep this as brief as possible, since last time I typed out a few paragraphs of details, my phone somehow wiped it all out.

As suggested by the title, I'm struggling over labels for a few reasons, and I'd really appreciate any sort of thoughts you peeps could give on the matter.

To start with, I'm AFAB, and I've been identifying as nonbinary for a few months now (and have managed to come out to two of my close friends). I only managed to settle on that cause I can distinctly recognize I'm not cis, but I don't really know where to take it from there, and I'm not sure if I'm entirely a transman either.

I experience dysphoria when someone refers to me with feminine terms (girl, lady, princess, etc), and it feels awful, really. And, when I'm mistaken as a guy, it usually makes me happier and smile. 

That part is fairly clear cut, but when it comes to my body, what dysphoria I have is a bit weird. My body is naturally very masculine for a female, so that bit doesn't particularly bother me. I like binding and hiding my chest, since it makes me feel better with being seen as a guy, but I don't mind my chest itself, since my mind registers it as just a body part or something. With regards to bottom dysphoria, it's bad some days where I wish I had male genitalia, but other days it doesn't bother me at all.

So all that is fine and dandy, I guess, and that makes me lean towards being a binary transman, but it's not that simple, since I don't feel comfortable thinking of myself in that manner either. I don't feel completely man. It's rather iffy, and really, sometimes I just feel nothing when it comes to gender. At least, I think that's the feeling, since I'm really bad at recognizing my own thoughts and emotions. 

I think it's also important to mention that my feelings about identity don't stem from hanging out with guys, or being fairly rough as a kid. I dress masculine frequently, but at the same time I can dress very feminine, so I wouldn't really say that influences my identity... (Except for that I feel better dressing feminine when I think of myself as more of a boy, and that I'll sometimes dress masculine to ""fit in with the guys"")

I swear my questioning period has been dragged on for years, sigh. I'm very sorry that I ramble a lot, and if you've managed to read through all that, I'd appreciate any advice you could offer. I'm also sorry that my thoughts get really messy, and that I'm typing all this out at 1 am while on vacation.

I've hopped around the terms demiboy, agender, bigender and obviously, nonbinary, but I haven't been able to get anyone else's opinion on this issue. I feel like a part of that is due to me being worried about being seen as silly or something for questioning this... (Almost all my irl friends say a lot of  homophobic/transphobic things.)

2019-07-31 22:02:44,ckf6fi,0,1,"I’m not sure how to navigate my love life and would really appreciate some help. Forgive this being a little scattered, as I’m trying to figure out how to explain as I write. Also forgive it being pretty complex and forgive how much of this feels like something for r/polyamory. I think it’s a genderqueer issue at its core. It’s also really hard for me to expose such intimate details about myself to strangers like this, so um… please be careful with that.

I’m genderqueer. The “woman trapped in a man’s body” cliche is not inaccurate, but my body is a man’s body and there’s nothing to be done about that. I have a very masculine build, I’m bald, bearded and hate the way I look clean shaven. In ways, that’s hard for me, to not be “pretty”. Cross-dressing is kind of fun, I like how my legs look in tights, but it still just feels like playing dress-up really, besides I look like a hulk in a dress.  Reassignment is just not an option for me, and I wouldn’t want to undergo reassignment, I don’t have genital dysphoria or anything. I’m actually coming to terms with my body. I’ve learned to like the idea that the role reversal I experience in the bedroom, the divide between the fact of my body, and my natural purpose as a sexual being is extreme. If that makes sense. But my authentic self is submissive, needs to be penetrated, would just die of joy if once in my lifetime a cute tomboi bought me a drink while I was sitting alone at the bar hoping someone would notice me. I understand that a lot of the dichotomies that feed my identity are false ones. It is not so simple as ""men are the aggressor and women are pretty"". But I think many of these stereotypes are very largely the case. And while these aren't rules, they inform what I identify about myself that I consider feminine, and I like that these things feel feminine to me. I guess this is all to say, I know I'm generalizing, I know which elements of this are potentially problematic, but please trust the parts of this I seem clear on are considered.

I’m 32, attracted to women and curious about men. I’ve been non-monogamous for three years, realizing the depth of my genderqueer identity about as long, and I've been committed to a wonderful female partner for nine months. Being non-monogamous has been a healthy choice overall for me. I was really hopeful about the possibilities of having a securely non-monogamous partner. We’ve both wanted sex with multiple partners. We both want to open our relationship to others. But despite being on the same page, it hasn’t been going well because of the complications of my gender identity. But then, nothing ever has.

I think I’ve gotten as far as I have romantically by behaving like a guy, even when it's been counterintuitive. I’ve been told I’ll never get what I really need this way, but I just can't picture me getting what I need anyhow at this point. I don't think I'm bad looking as a male, but I just can’t imagine how I ever would have connected with anyone romantically if I hadn’t repeatedly made choices like messaging first countless times in online dating, talking to someone first at the bar, being sexually aggressive in the way that makes a woman feel desired. I sense I need to change certain things, like maybe explain all this up front in dating profiles? But idk. It's hard to summarize, for one thing. And I'm really private about my personal life, owing largely to having been victimized by a stalker during formative years. I'm like 90% sure when I told a friend about this, she outed me and word got to my family, which is mortifying. Putting this vulnerable side of myself at the forefront of my public-facing social identity is scary for me. Even writing this is scary. If I had to attach my picture and my real name to it?

Anyway, my partner and I got as far as we have because I was capable of being a more dynamic person for her. She was interested, for example, in exploring submission, and I have a lot of experience being sexually dominant because this is what satisfies many women and I want my partners to be happy. But we’ve both learned through the course of our relationship that we’re not a perfect fit for each other. She’s bisexual, but seeing me in a bra and panties was unattractive to her. She’ll penetrate me when it’s becoming a problem how neglected this fundamental aspect of my self is. And I have to admit to an amount of resentment I feel, at least envy, because I’ve so frequently felt like I have to do things that don’t feel natural to me, while her needs get met because she's a pretty woman, and thus desired. But in theory, this should all be workable, because this is the whole point of non-monogamy, that you can have several partners if one can’t fulfill your various needs. I had wished that she could fulfill more of what I needed. But so it goes.

We've only had one sexual experience with another couple, call him J and her D. We hesitated to act on the possibility with them because I had expressed my unease over the fact that D is very submissive, which again, it doesn’t feel natural to me to be the sexual aggressor. It was clear she wouldn't, for instance, text me first, or much at all. I felt like it could be okay in the end, so we tried it, and it was overall a really positive experience in and of itself. Over the following months I expressed my discomfort over my partner and J texting fairly frequetly. It wasn’t jealousy. My concern was that D and I weren’t really clicking and it didn’t seem to me like it was important to her whether I was fulfilled in the arrangement. I was uneasy about needing to be the aggressor to keep this thing she's enjoying running smoothly for her. Her reaction to me bringing this up was negative in a way I’ve never seen her which was awful for me. I understand it’s frustrating. It isn’t as though she can help that women don’t behave around me the way I wish they would. Still, I’m carrying some major anxiety as we move forward because I feel like a liability.

And again, this is pretty specific to non-monogamy, but the vast majority of mfmf cases are ones where the women are the only ones who get paid attention. Of course, there’s an abundance of guys who are interested in a threesome, which I’m not even disinterested in, but the issue is that to this other guy I’m almost definitely incidental, not as relevant as my female partner. She’s wanted to start looking for people again, and I do too, but I’m growing skeptical about my chance of ever finding the kind of partner I know I need. I know I’ve never had what would really satisfy me, and I know that I’ve been looking really REALLY hard (by anyone’s standards) and for a very long time. She’s volunteered to take the lead with looking for others this time, which is really strong of her, and obviously it's going very smoothly. And so I get screenshots of guys she’s attracted to. “He seems really great, he has a female partner who he doms, he says they’d be open to meeting with us.” Which, it’s hard to feel negative about, but it all feels kind of abstract. So there’s a guy who wants to have sex with her. That doesn’t mean anything to me because he doesn’t mean anything to me. It means even less that there’s some woman who may or may not theoretically be interested, that neither of us has seen. My partner is doing a great job of providing the security we lost when she reacted negatively before. But this has all brought my need for attention to the forefront. It highlights how irrelevant I already felt.

So now what? I feel like I’ve finally gotten to a point where I know what I need. And it’s a relationship with a woman where I’m the one who fulfills the traditional roles of a woman. If I’m dynamic, if I make things happen for myself because ostensibly this is the only way they will, that is, if I play the traditional gender role of a guy, it’ll eventually get to a point like the one I find myself in now, where I’m frustrated my needs aren’t being met. But even setting aside where my current relationship is at, I would be just plain lost already as to how to attract someone who makes me feel like a woman.

As a very masculine bodied genderqueer woman, I feel so out of place, even among the atypical gender identities of this group. How do I find people that want me? I don’t even know that they exist, but at best I know they’re so exceedingly rare I can never count on one approaching me even when I’m in my cutest outfit looking my most approachable. I feel like the only real avenue for this is fetlife, where I can (this feels so gross to even say) ""advertise"" myself as a submissive, but I have done that, am doing that. It doesn’t get you attention. Making this a ""fetish"" thing feels like burying the lede. It's like, do you know how hard it is to find pornography where a male bodied person is sissified and penetrated in a way that feels respectful? Practically impossible. Tinder is the site everyone uses, and it's not designed for providing meaningful context.

I want to blame this stupid body. Despite everything I said earlier about feeling okay about it, being okay that it's a man's body, I see it as a huge obstacle and I can’t tell you how much I hate it and wish I had been born the right gender. Because I feel undesireable. This feels like a vehicle for a person I'm not. Crazy that this feels like a total afterthought, but I have pretty considerable issues with my weight, too, because I don’t feel desired no matter what I do, so what does it even matter what I look like?

TL:DR; I look overwhelmingly like a manly man and feel overwhelmingly like a girlie girl. How can I attract the strong woman I need? And hopefully fast, because I really need to move forward?

It was clear she wouldn\'t, for instance, text me first, or much at all. I felt like it could be okay in the end, so we tried it, and it was overall a really positive experience in and of itself. Over the following months I expressed my discomfort over my partner and J texting fairly frequetly. It wasn’t jealousy. My concern was that D and I weren’t really clicking and it didn’t seem to me like it was important to her whether I was fulfilled in the arrangement. I was uneasy about needing to be the aggressor to keep this thing she\'s enjoying running smoothly for her. Her reaction to me bringing this up was negative in a way I’ve never seen her which was awful for me. I understand it’s frustrating. It isn’t as though she can help that women don’t behave around me the way I wish they would. Still, I’m carrying some major anxiety as we move forward because I feel like a liability.\n\nAnd again, this is pretty specific to non-monogamy, but the vast majority of mfmf cases are ones where the women are the only ones who get paid attention. Of course, there’s an abundance of guys who are interested in a threesome, which I’m not even disinterested in, but the issue is that to this other guy I’m almost definitely incidental, not as relevant as my female partner. She’s wanted to start looking for people again, and I do too, but I’m growing skeptical about my chance of ever finding the kind of partner I know I need. I know I’ve never had what would really satisfy me, and I know that I’ve been looking really REALLY hard (by anyone’s standards) and for a very long time. She’s volunteered to take the lead with looking for others this time, which is really strong of her, and obviously it\'s going very smoothly. And so I get screenshots of guys she’s attracted to. “He seems really great, he has a female partner who he doms, he says they’d be open to meeting with us.” Which, it’s hard to feel negative about, but it all feels kind of abstract. So there’s a guy who wants to have sex with her. That doesn’t mean anything to me because he doesn’t mean anything to me. It means even less that there’s some woman who may or may not theoretically be interested, that neither of us has seen. My partner is doing a great job of providing the security we lost when she reacted negatively before. But this has all brought my need for attention to the forefront. It highlights how irrelevant I already felt.\n\nSo now what? I feel like I’ve finally gotten to a point where I know what I need. And it’s a relationship with a woman where I’m the one who fulfills the traditional roles of a woman. If I’m dynamic, if I make things happen for myself because ostensibly this is the only way they will, that is, if I play the traditional gender role of a guy, it’ll eventually get to a point like the one I find myself in now, where I’m frustrated my needs aren’t being met. But even setting aside where my current relationship is at, I would be just plain lost already as to how to attract someone who makes me feel like a woman.\n\nAs a very masculine bodied genderqueer woman, I feel so out of place, even among the atypical gender identities of this group. How do I find people that want me? I don’t even know that they exist, but at best I know they’re so exceedingly rare I can never count on one approaching me even when I’m in my cutest outfit looking my most approachable. I feel like the only real avenue for this is fetlife, where I can (this feels so gross to even say) ""advertise"" myself as a submissive, but I have done that, am doing that. It doesn’t get you attention. Making this a ""fetish"" thing feels like burying the lede. It\'s like, do you know how hard it is to find pornography where a male bodied person is sissified and penetrated in a way that feels respectful? Practically impossible. Tinder is the site everyone uses, and it\'s not designed for providing meaningful context.\n\nI want to blame this stupid body. Despite everything I said earlier about feeling okay about it, being okay that it\'s a man\'s body, I see it as a huge obstacle and I can’t tell you how much I hate it and wish I had been born the right gender. Because I feel undesireable. This feels like a vehicle for a person I\'m not. Crazy that this feels like a total afterthought, but I have pretty considerable issues with my weight, too, because I don’t feel desired no matter what I do, so what does it even matter what I look like?\n\nTL:DR; I look overwhelmingly like a manly man and feel overwhelmingly like a girlie girl. How can I attract the strong woman I need? And hopefully fast, because I really need to move forward? Can anyone relate?', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Dating advice, please?
