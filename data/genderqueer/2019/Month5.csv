2019-05-01 04:46:12,bjd9il,9,8,"Not sure if this is the right place for it, but there's been a couple of these today so here goes.

I'm a 20 year old, AMAB, have been questioning being male for a few months or so and I'm still completely lost.

I guess I've never really fit the stereotypical ""male"" definition, I've stopped myself several times from joining clubs or doing activities that are considered ""feminine"" (ex. dance or volleyball).  I've also had a lot of trouble historically with making male friends, I was in an all-female friend group in high school and I still feel weird expressing emotions to males.

Now that I'm in a much more inclusive environment and have taken care of some mental health problems (to some extent at least), I've started to think more and more about my gender.  I've started to go as they/them pronouns in some of my circles that I know are inclusive and it just feels more right than he/him that I've always gone by.

My problem is I don't know what to do from here - am I a closeted female just holding myself back, or am I genderfluid or genderqueer or what (and what do those even mean)?  Obviously I don't expect some random stranger to just bestow an identity on me like it's the sorting hat but I really don't know where to go to or who to ask for answers.  I've talked to a few people who have gone through similar things and it sounds like everything just came naturally over time, but I feel like I really should get an identity cemented while I'm still at college (and still in an inclusive space).

Growing up in a space where a non-binary gender was the butt of many a joke at the dinner table I'm also concerned about how my family would feel - not that they would disown me or anything, it's just going to be incredibly awkward.  Not to mention work, or classes, or socializing in friend groups that haven't seen anyone step outside the binary.  Part of me wants to just ignore this whole thing and just go as male forever because that would just be ""easier"", but I know that's not going to make me happy in life.

hello friends! this is gonna be a sort of depressing post so if you don't want to get bogged down by the big sad™ go look at the super cute selfies people are posting in this subreddit instead!

so i'm non-binary, and my friends at school almost always use the correct pronouns for me (they/them) and correct others when they use the wrong pronouns (even when i don't because i'm a coward oof). i really appreciate their support, and i definitely feel super lucky to have really accepting friends, but i feel so disheartened when they slip-up and use she/her instead. i know they're trying, but i can't help but feel like everything is performative and that even though they're using the right pronouns most of the time, it's just to be a good friend and not really because they see me as the gender i want to be perceived as. i would love to say, ""hey i'm ok with any pronouns!"" but i know that most people would use she/her because i look more feminine and am AFAB when really what i want when i say any pronouns is to be referred to with a mix of pronouns. and i know that i can't change years of ingrained societal ideology about gender and gender roles, but when strangers automatically default to seeing me as a girl i just wanna cry. (insert screams) to make things worse, i recently sort-of started seeing someone and i told them my pronouns/gender identity from the get-go and they kept introducing me as their girlfriend!! i was super pissed and obviously broke it off with them, but i was also just really freakin sad and cried in my room for a while. anyway, this post doesn't really have a purpose except for venting, but if y'all feel the same, how do you deal with it?

Okay so I'm m2f, and I've been on hormones for several years. There's a lot I have figured out but a few things I haven't. And I don't know if these are normal things, just me things, or what. 


I do not have a period obviously. I take a shot at the same dose, on the same day, at about the same time, every week. There are still recurring patterns. It's not exactly monthly, and it's not exactly consistent, but it's obviously hormone driven. I'll get irritable, retain ridiculous amounts of water, and other nonsense. The nonsense varies. Read the side effects list and pick some at random. It's like that. 


My obgyn tests my hormone levels. They've always been in a normal range. I can't explain it. The best-worst I can come up with is I'm some variety of bipolar, but that doesn't explain why it doesn't last more than a few days and then I pee what seems like a gallon of water. Or maybe I'm crazy. This would not surprise me. 


Up next, boobs. I grew some, they're small but hey. My question is... Why do they still hurt sometimes for no reason? I've been on hormones for over a decade. They are not growing. But every now and then, my nipples will get angry with me. This goes away in a few days. It's not from fabric rubbing on them or anything like that. They just decide to do this. Sometimes they feel tender on the sides too. As an aside, winter and stairs suck, and I'm still bitter about both. But what can you do.


Lastly, and this one I couldn't find in any side effects list or anyone mentioning it online... Opening jars, lifting things... Anything where there's a lot of pull on my skin. It hurts now to put the same effort into it. I don't know what to call that quality of someone's skin, but it seems like it got... Stretchier. Maybe? It's easier to cut, bruise, and in general seems more fragile. Maybe it's because I'm getting older but I don't look old, and my skin doesn't feel old. I didn't notice this until I had been on hormones for a few years. Being easier to bruise is a listed side effect. The rest no.

I've fairly recently realized that I'm non-binary. I'm female-presenting and I don't have an issue with she/her pronouns, but I've never felt like ""female"" really fits me. I'm about to start a new job in a new city where no one knows me, and I really want to change my name to something gender-neutral.

2019-05-08 11:12:51,bm3xz0,1,0,"I have been thinking about the idea of gender-fluidity but I can't think about it properly without knowing what exactly is being debated.

From what I understand, the claim is that gender should be separated from sex. I think everyone agrees that there are only two sexes: Male and Female. 

Gender has historically been associated with gender in such a way that these two terms became interchangeable.

The idea, as I see it, is that there's an attempt to strip this connection. This can only happen in two ways:

  1.  You define gender to be a completely subjective term that represents how you feel about what you are and   
acknowledge that there is an infinite amount of possible genders. This also requires gender to be removed from   
legislation, replaced by the word ""sex"", which holds the same meaning as the old ""gender"". The result is simply a   
new word that represents how you feel about yourself. 

2.   You define gender very carefully to avoid having to exclude it from legal documentation by creating subgroups belonging to the preexisting gender classification, for example:

2.1 Male Man

2.2 Male Woman

2.3 Female Man

2.4 Female Woman

This allows the society to still apply the same rules and filters while also recognizing the validity of different ways of expressing yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

From what I gathered, Scenario 1 is much more common. There are no problems with either scenario, as they still preserve the meaning of being a Man or a Woman. As an example for why it's required to preserve this idea is sports. You can't have a transgender woman playing on a woman's sports team. In scenario one this woman would be classified as a Male and the team would be called Female's sports team. In Scenario two it's the same thing except the Woman would be classified as a Male Woman. 

&amp;#x200B;

My first question is, do you agree with what I said or do you believe in a different scenario?

&amp;#x200B;

My second question is this: In either of these scenarios, no real differences in the society happen, except for the illusion of ""acceptance"" provided by the change of meaning and application of a single word.  Why would it be desirable? How would this help? The problem I'm having with it is that not only does this require a lot of effort to implement in a way that doesn't confuse society, it's also fueling the acceptance of a psychiatric disorder, similar to changing the word ""reality"" to whatever you think is real, in order to help people suffering from schizophrenia accept themselves better.",genderqueer,What is gender?,1557339171.0,"{'created_utc': 1557313971, 'id': 'bm3xz0', 'num_comments': 1, 'score': 0, 'selftext': 'I have been thinking about the idea of gender-fluidity but I can\'t think about it properly without knowing what exactly is being debated.\n\nFrom what I understand, the claim is that gender should be separated from sex.

i'm a masc-leaning genderqueer person who was wondering if there are any good ideas on how to wear v necks (or lower :B) with a binder on. it feels quite masculine to me to be able to wear a shirt with the top button or two undone, but i've never been able to do it while wearing my binder (have to wear shirts with [all the buttons up](https://i.imgur.com/yAYoHur.jpg) and i'm always [adjusting the neckline](https://i.imgur.com/It0yv1E.jpg) if i unbutton it sigh), since obviously they need to be quite high in the front to bind ""properly"".

i have in the past learned to do what they call open chest binding (i used to be a cosplayer lol) which looks great of course but it uses lots of sports/medical tape which is really bad for your skin and also expensive for everyday use so please don't do that. i was wondering has anyone discovered other binders that have lower cut necklines, or has anyone even dared to trim/alter one of their own? i'm actually considering buying a new one and cutting into my old one, but i worry that it will cause the binder to fray or bind less effectively.

Today is like Valentine's day is for single people if that's not true for someone. It can feel like they're missing out. And for the LGBTQ community, today can be hard for a lot of us. Many of our parents didn't accept us. And family get-togethers prompt uncomfortable questions about whether to go, how to dress, or just being alone with our thoughts.


I thought for awhile what I could possibly say that would help. For me, there are so many questions and things  mom would have taught me that I don't know or had to learn on my own or from friends.

2019-05-14 05:54:19,boeuvk,6,3,"This is literally my first ever post on Reddit, but I have been reading over some of the posts here the last couple nights and figured the best way to really get some guidance and information was to post and get feedback first hand. I also apologize if I misuse terminology or say anything incorrect. I am still learning, so please educate me!

&amp;#x200B;

As it says in the title, I'm AFAB, bisexual, in my late-20's. As a child I was a tom-boy, then went through the quintessential teenage goth phase. Through most of my early twenties, I felt comfortable with my femininity/womanhood. Through college, I felt comfortable in dresses and wanted to be seen as female. Recently though, I've been having some issues with how I perceive myself. The past few years I've been dressing masculine more often (but not always!) I tend to still wear makeup -- sometimes because I truly enjoy it, but other times I feel as though I'm not going to pass anyway, so I may as well keep presenting as a woman. I'm not going to lie, but that new SnapChat filter has me all kinds of fucked up. Seeing myself in a more masculine way, with a stronger jawline and facial hair almost made me sad? Because it made me realize that sometimes when I dress masculine I wish I looked like that. Sometimes I wish I legitimately WAS that person who was like 6'2 and muscular with a cut jawline.  


I was discussing this with an AFAB friend who identifies as a cisgender woman but dresses masculine just as often as she does feminine, and her experience seems different than mine. When she wears masculine clothes she likes being seen as a woman in masculine clothes. But when I dress masculine I wish I wasn't as curvy or my breasts were smaller. I feel like my body doesn't fit what I'm trying to portray to the world. In that same conversation, I asked if she'd ever visualized having a penis -- both sexually and just in general, and she said she had never felt that way. Even though the years where I felt comfortable with my femininity, I have always had thoughts about having a penis and what it would feel like. That being said, I'm not consistently uncomfortable with having a vagina either.

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly thought that everyone felt this way, so I have never fully questioned myself as a cisgendered woman before. And I think because I just thought it was ""normal"" I've never felt like...strong feelings towards being misgendered before. I feel so silly to only be considering this when I'm nearly 30.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I'm an AFAB in my late-20's. In the past few years, I recently started dressing more masculine, but I felt fine with my femininity through my late teens/early twenties when I was dressing more feminine. When I dress masculine I wish I had facial hair/a different body type. I have had thoughts of wishing I had a penis since childhood, both in a sexual context and just in general (but not all the time). I've not necessarily felt horribly misgendered until now.

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's up to me to fully define myself, but I just came here looking for some answers in order to guide my path. Is it common for a cisgender person to have had feelings of wanting the opposite genitals for most of their life? Is it common for gender fluid/non-binary people not to experience strong feelings of being misgendered through their life? Is it possible to want to present as masculine but still wear make-up or paint your nails? Is it common for gender fluid/non-binary people to have very long stretches of feeling male/female/both? Basically, is it possible that I'm non-binary/gender fluid/something else or should I just stay in my cisgender lane?",genderqueer,Looking for Guidance - AFAB,1557838459.0,"{'created_utc': 1557813259, 'id': 'boeuvk', 'num_comments': 6, 'score': 3, 'selftext': 'This is literally my first ever post on Reddit, but I have been reading over some of the posts here the last couple nights and figured the best way to really get some guidance and information was to post and get feedback first hand.

As a child I was a tom-boy, then went through the quintessential teenage goth phase. Through most of my early twenties, I felt comfortable with my femininity/womanhood. Through college, I felt comfortable in dresses and wanted to be seen as female. Recently though, I\'ve been having some issues with how I perceive myself. The past few years I\'ve been dressing masculine more often (but not always!) I tend to still wear makeup -- sometimes because I truly enjoy it, but other times I feel as though I\'m not going to pass anyway, so I may as well keep presenting as a woman. I\'m not going to lie, but that new SnapChat filter has me all kinds of fucked up. Seeing myself in a more masculine way, with a stronger jawline and facial hair almost made me sad? Because it made me realize that sometimes when I dress masculine I wish I looked like that. Sometimes I wish I legitimately WAS that person who was like 6\'2 and muscular with a cut jawline.  \n\n\nI was discussing this with an AFAB friend who identifies as a cisgender woman but dresses masculine just as often as she does feminine, and her experience seems different than mine. When she wears masculine clothes she likes being seen as a woman in masculine clothes. But when I dress masculine I wish I wasn\'t as curvy or my breasts were smaller. I feel like my body doesn\'t fit what I\'m trying to portray to the world. In that same conversation, I asked if she\'d ever visualized having a penis -- both sexually and just in general, and she said she had never felt that way. Even though the years where I felt comfortable with my femininity, I have always had thoughts about having a penis and what it would feel like. That being said, I\'m not consistently uncomfortable with having a vagina either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI honestly thought that everyone felt this way, so I have never fully questioned myself as a cisgendered woman before.

2019-05-18 01:12:39,bpzbf0,5,8,"Hi all,

I think it's been very prominent in my life that I do not like a lot of the traditional male roles in society, I am gay and most of my interests would be considered traditionally feminine, such as makeup, and I have a strong interest in drag which started years ago when I was a lot younger. I  am perfectly happy with being male...but somehow I still feel uncomfortable in social situations, and I really cannot explain the feeling to the fullest extent.

I hate people referring to me as a ""man"" and in fact it actually makes me cringe, and I think that's due to the ideas I personally have about what a ""man"" should be according to society, and I have never fit that mould. I've had a very big personal issue of alienating myself from a very young age due to my sexuality and I have a lot of issues now because of it, I cannot make friends or hold conversations with men and am uncomfortable within social settings where we're divided into ""boys and girls"". During school this was a huge issue for me, I hated and refused to do my phys ed classes because of this. 

I have considered the idea of being trans \[MTF\] but, I'm not uncomfortable with my body and i'm not uncomfortable with me being myself, but I don't know if ""myself"" is necessarily male or female. I have a love for all things feminine which I live out through drag and other means but I don't wish to really  live my life as a woman. or identify as one. My problem is mainly with the stereotypes/roles/limitations set on me from existing gender, so I have no idea how to conclude this. 

I have also considered the idea of being gender fluid or gender neutral, but I'm unsure of placing a label on myself that I don't know if I fully subscribe to, despite me actually feeling as though my gender is extremely fluid. I'm not sure, and honestly just overall very confused. Could anyone help me out in how they came to terms/the realisation that they were genderqueer?

This is a throwaway post for the usual reasons. I'll include a TL;DR. Sorry for mediocre English, I'm not a native speaker.

So, a little bit of context. I've been with my GF for 5 years. We met in uni, lived together for some time and for our first year of working life are in different countries.
There were times when she would feel bad about something I said or issues with her family and she wouldn't let me know until she got into a very dark place and really needed some support. She took more than a year to told me about her previous, abusive relationship, or about the times she struggled with racism. This led me to grow a little paranoid and ask her very often how she was feeling, etc.

About a month ago she called me, very anxious, and she told me she was questioning her gender. I told her I was relieved she told me, that I was listening if she wanted to open up about this but she replied that telling me about the issue was enough. I didn't push much because it was over the phone but we agreed to talk about it someday.

Now this weekend I'll be visiting her and I want us to at least help somehow but I'm really unsure how to proceed. Since we both want to enjoy our precious time together I'm afraid she'll try to brush it off. 

How do I bring this up in a healthy way? Should I pry or not at all?
I would also be interested in ways to find communities where she could openly talk about it.

2019-05-27 02:55:41,btgsxb,0,2,"I am starting to have a lot of doubts as to what I actually am, at start after years of denial I decided to find a gender therapist to talk about it and kinda thought I was clearly a trans woman, therapy didn’t rly help much other than being an anchor for me so I won’t go back into denial, so don’t suggest that because I literally cannot talk about more deeper stuff to therapists, only the person I’m emotionally attached to,so unless I find a therapist bf they are useless for me.

I spend many years in denial, really scared of any kind of femininity  yet at the same time often had thoughts of being female, in both normal and sexual ways which I told no one, I was quite insecure about being paired with anything female, literally never shaved cuz of that reason too, and my insecurity was quite obvious to my best friend since he did notice like some areas about that felt like he touched a nerve so wasn’t even surprised when I told him.

The thing is at the start I obsessed over passing, like I thought I wanted to look fully female(mostly face/body wise since I despise make up and most female clothing since it’s all revealing and tight), but now after around 6 months of hrt I started liking my appearance, which rly isn’t very female yet in a way I’m ‘satisfied’

Like can be confused for a woman from the sides due to my long hair or from far away which I had before anyway, but pretty much everywhere we would go with my (gay male) friend on our vacations ppl called us ‘guys’, which I honestly never minded, randos opinions mean nothing to me really so never had this whole ‘waah they misgendered me thing’ probably because I’m unsure of my own gender at this point. Though I do enjoy when my friend makes jokes about me being a woman(not sexual) or use female pronouns in private since he knows I lean more that way but I don’t want everyone to do that, it is like I feel fine being a weird male in public using my chosen male name and keep that other side as something more ‘personal’

So in general, I kinda look like a fat guy with long hair and somewhat feminine face that is pretty male from the front, body is pretty chubby so boobs can probably pass as moobs outside and I wouldn’t mind having the bottom surgery since I always disliked having a penis since it always felt so wrong and useless but that is a far away dream now so I need the money for other stuff rn. I pretty much look like a rly weird somewhat female looking guy that acts like a gay bottom which I technically still am I guess?

I rly have absolutely no idea where I fit in label wise, I’m definitely not a normal trans woman since I dislike any kind of female clothing, mannerisms and don’t want anyone but my rly close friend know I lean towards there but not that much, I honestly feel more something in between now so I’m rly unsure if I would count as non binary or something else.

2019-05-27 08:31:00,btjjw2,0,1,"Specifically, what is dysphoria?

Google tells me that dysphoria is specifically:  ""A state of feeling uneasy, unhappy, or unwell.""

If we take it a step further, we can identify gender dysphoria.  Which is an uneasy, unhappy, or unwell feeling regarding one's gender/gender identity.  

Personally, through all my confusion and questioning I have discovered that I have found the most amount of happiness in referring to myself either as genderqueer or genderless.  Since that realization, my sense of dysphoria has slowly dwindled down to be less and less.  The only time my dysphoria starts to kick in nowadays is when I cannot properly present myself as I wish to be seen, which I'm learning is more difficult than I imagined at first.  But what is easy about all this, anyways?

Onto what I've been thinking of.  I feel like its weird that the only times I ever hear people talk about dysphoria in general is in reference to their gender expression or gender identity.  And while I understand the importance of having a gender identity of some sort since gender is omnirelevant within our language, I feel as though dysphoria is a much more broad topic than simply gender alone.

You can feel uneasy, unhappy, or unwell and be dysphoric about a lot of different things.  I know people to be dysphoric about specific aspects of their bodies, things that are unchangeable or unmoldable.  They seek out plastic surgery and other such things as means of alleviating this all of the time.  People work out and go to the gym, they wear makeup, they buy better clothing, they meditate and seek out religion (or some other form of belief).  All in the name of bettering themselves and further developing their own personal identities.  

People are dysphoric about a lot of things.  Before I struggled with my gender identity I struggled with religion.  Before I struggled with religion I struggled with other things.  There seems to be so much more to life than your gender identity, religious identity, etc.  That it becomes difficult to define a person by their gender.

But we're human and we want to fit everyone into boxes and categories, nicely organized rather than the chaotic jumbled mess that we really are.  

I'd argue that cis people experience dysphoria too, they just don't really have a name for it.  They might not be struggling with their gender identity, but they might struggle with some other form of identity instead.  And I'm starting to come to the conclusion that we could do some good for this world, if we all started being a little more honest about the subject than we were.

Transpeople, genderqueer people, agender people, gender nonconformists, they're in a unique position regarding dysphoria.  They are put into a position where their sense of self is so radically different to the bodies that they're born in, that they absolutely have to change at least *something* about it in order to start feeling good about themselves again.  But I think the reality is that everyone in this world is at least a little bit dysphoric about something.  Some things we have to just accept as flaws we'll always have, some things we can change and improve and adapt upon.  But with cis people, never so much as *questioning* seems a bit odd to me.  Never once asking the question about what life would be like if you were in some way *different* than you've always been.  To me it seems strange to never at least ask yourself the question.  Oh and I don't know what's going on inside a cis person's head.  But what I do know is that I see people questioning gender roles, gender identities all the bloody fucking time.  And its not just transmen and transwomen.  Its every-single fucking one of us.  At least to some degree.  

I wonder what the world would look like if we just allowed everyone to question freely with no shame, no judgement, no hate.  And then we could all experiment to our hearts content.  Would I be the same as I am now if that were the case?  Probably not, but I don't think I'd be ""me"" either so I'm not sure if I want all that freedom and power for self-expression.  Regardless, I feel like it would be better.  And I think its time everyone started being a little more honest about it, cispersons included.

2019-05-29 01:12:54,bu8blt,3,6,"I've had uncomfortable gender feelings for a while here now and I can't seem to sort them out on my own. 

-I'm AFAB and never really minded being raised as a girl. Kids called me a boy as an insult and it hurt but I'm not sure if it was just their nastiness as a whole 

-I'm deeply uncomfortable when I display more ""masculine"" personality traits. I say masculine with a grain of salt bc I don't really buy into that as being much more than a construct, but I identify as a lesbian and I'm terrified of being overly forward with anyone I'm interested in like I perceive cis men doing. not sure if that makes sense.

-I don't think I want to be male but when I think about having sharper features I think it might be nice. Don't really want bottom surgery but I think at least a significant breast reduction might be nice if not a mastectomy 

-I don't mind she/her pronouns but referring to me as anything that feels maternal or matronly like ma'am gives me the heebies. I don't want kids by any means bc i can barely care for myself but the thought of myself ever being pregnant specifically makes me want to die

-I don't like my birth name. I've been on the hunt for a new one no matter my gender alignment and I think a more unisex name would be freeing. Hard to find one that makes sense  

-I am really uncomfortable with my weight (overweight) and a lot of that is definitely fat phobia and difficulty finding clothes but a lot of it seems tied to being perceived as  some mother archetype. I maybe have BDD but gender seems pretty tied in too

-Cis guys who show interest in me freak me out and a ton of that is the gendered expectations they project on me. I wonder sometimes if I'm repressing bisexuality because I don't want to be ""treated like a woman"" by a (cishet especially) dude or seen as ""the woman"" by outsiders in this hypothetical relationship 

-I like the idea ""demigirl"" presents but sometimes I want nothing to do with gender at all. I often like being female aligned and would have trouble letting go of a sapphic understanding of myself on some level at least 

so essentially I know I'm struggling with gender roles and body issues, but not sure whether I'm struggling with gender identity and kind of don't get what gender identity feels like beyond roles kinda. I think I'd be much happier if gender in general wasn't really a ""thing""  in our society but I can't imagine a world like that clearly enough to figure out whether there's anything beyond that for me. Also I don't think I intrinsically have the most stable or consistent sense of identity (childhood trauma lol) but these feelings have been getting louder for a couple years here. 

I find it hard not to hate and be ashamed of myself on some level and I'm sure gender isn't the only factor there but if it's one at all, I think I want to start addressing it.

2019-05-30 21:00:45,buyhnx,4,12,"Today a story bubbled up out of T_D about a gender fluid school shooter, which made it to /r/all before getting deleted because the headline was misleading. Claims of a coverup now abound. Last week they closed a school because some 12 year old trans kid was a victim of a witchhunt. They were going to kill that child. Silence. The week before some asshat with alphabet soup at the end of his name got banned off Twitter and a bunch of people lost their minds; A doctor trying to weave a narrative that supported transphobic views with a bunch of half-truths and pseudo-intellectual crap. People cried censorship and ignored what happened when they didn't put a lid on this shit last time; Antivaxxers and a literal plague. He's still out there practicing medicine. 


The week before that -- you know what, it's every week. It's been every week for years now. Imagine a boot stomping someone in the cunt every week forever. That's me. I'm under that boot. Society has gotten ugly, and it's violent, and every last one of them believe they're on the right side of justice, god, logic, or... whatever. I don't want to be right -- I just want to stop getting kicked. There are no sides in this war I want to be on. 


People on the left (I'll get to the right too -- I'm eo/aa/omgwtfbbq) are all about raising awareness, inclusiveness, and tolerance. Which is fine and dandy up to the part where they're so open minded they actually believe there's a million genders, think putting 'preferred pronouns' on our introduction name tags is thoughtful instead of horrifyingly deaf, and get so busy virtue signaling with each other they fail to notice. I've actually had them correct me -- on how to refer to myself, or tell me how to think about myself. I get told all the time I shouldn't be friends with people who don't ""accept you for who you are"" -- as if they have any business telling me who I get to associate with. How is that inclusive? I can respect the intention -- but not the result. 


Not to be outdone, I'm a punching bag for the right. All of us are little anti-christs running around murdering and pillaging decent society with our wicked queer ways. We're what they point to when they spit and say ""political correctness."" We're the punchline for the big bad ""liberal"" agenda, and they will unload dump trucks full of bullshit they think is ""logic"". It's half-baked verbal diarrhea about chromosomes and biology and no matter how many arguments are demolished they've got another lined up fresh from the vast ghetto of social fucking media. 


It's all just rationalizing deeply felt anxieties about the future, the unknown, ""those people"". They live in constant fear, all their media screams and gushes out fear. Their amygdala has a taser shoved in it. They think facts and truth are discovered once, and then need never be investigated again. Yet they'll believe a screaming fat guy pushing herbal remedies talking about how the government is turning the frogs gay. Or tell us not to ""flaunt"" our gayness when we wear a rainbow pin as they drive by in their jacked up coal burner with a ten foot wide American flag stapled to its ass, two silhouettes of women in bikinis stuck to the back window, and red white and blue truck balls. Facts and logic though, right? Free speech but only in the comfortable, designated areas picked far out of view. 


The two sides both point the finger at each other; All *I'm* getting is the finger. 


Everyday I wake up and open up my dresser and I make a choice about how much I want to be abused. Wear jeans and a t-shirt and I'm a guy until people are standing next to me in line and notice the bra lines. Wear a dress and I'm the tranny and parents try to awkwardly shovel their kids out of the aisle when all I'm there for is some flavor of ramen. But don't worry -- they all like Ellen on TV and have a gay neighbor so it's cool, right? 


I have my breakfast -- a handful of pills and that's usually it. I go to the grocery store about once a month maybe and I've lost over 50 pounds in the last year because it's easier to just not eat than deal with people. That's not the only reason though -- I work in a restaurant, it's just I'm so anxious all the time I don't have an appetite and can't eat more than a handful of anything at a time or it's a visit to the porcelain goddess. 


And I know it's a problem -- the doctors just turn me away and tell me it's a problem best solved in therapy. I've already got another pointless appointment for next week to tell another one I'm actually totally fine and nothing is wrong... I'm just here to generate revenue. You want to know what queer people talk about after group therapy is over and the therapists leave? It's how to lie to them to jump through all the hoops. It's insane that so many people have to lie to fit into a narrative about them that grew up out of the culture of 40 years ago and expected to do that in the culture of today. And ironically, it's considered socially *progressive* they get treated at all.


Hundreds of experts with degrees and piles of studies and books in little rooms all over America are so utterly divorced from the reality of what their patients are going through it's heartbreaking. For a lot of people, ""do no harm"" may as well be ""do nothing at all"". The sad truth is, they're scared of the general public too. Scared they'll be sued, or arrested -- and I'm not gonna sit here and tell them they should be brave and do what is necessary when I'm locking myself in gas station bathrooms and passing out facing the same shit.


The doctor's office has become a political office where they prescribe thoughts and prayers instead of medicine for too many people. I don't know anyone I haven't had to say ""You just gotta keep trying until you find someone who gets it."" Honestly... a lot of people just give up and live in misery until depression catches up to them and they check out. Oh, it's so sad, but you know, there was nothing anyone could do. Except, you know, treat them as patients... or even just human beings. 


I go to work and I see the men talking with the men, and the women with the women, and nobody's talking to me because I'm not really either to them. Oh, they're polite, it's just that everyone is more comfortable with me not existing so I quite conveniently went ahead and did that. It's nice when people remember the right pronouns, but speaking for myself it doesn't mean a whole lot if nobody's comfortable enough to actually talk to me. I mean, I can start conversations with them but the reverse doesn't happen. I make friends with people -- they don't make friends with me. Almost nobody initiates. That's the daily reality of this culture war. And even within our community, we're often too uncomfortable with each other because there's no scripts to follow.


An endless war
_________



Driving home it's just the music cranked up and stuffing the memories. Mom still can't say 'daughter' after fuck-all years but progress because now I'm just the ""older child"", ""sibling"", or whatever. She calls once every few weeks to see if I'm still alive, say she loves me. Offers to help with the job search with a few bucks for a certification. Forgets she tried charging rent and said she wouldn't help with college after I came out. Forgets she's gone back on pretty much every promise she's made. Like everyone else. I tell her I love her too and hangup the phone, because against my better judgement every day I still want a family. And I wish I could have one of my own, but I'm too old, I'm sterile, and finding someone is a minefield of problems I've dealt with one too many times and I don't think I can trust anyone again. As far as romance is concerned, being in between is being nowhere at all.


This is the shit people don't want to talk about. It's easy to reduce someone to an object, an abstract. It's easy to make it political. Too easy. We even do it to ourselves, with the best intentions. It's the greatest trick of modern society that we're all individuals, and we've got freedom, and we're just so star spangled awesome -- just don't hug. Don't make eye contact. This is a country where we made corporations people years before we were willing to legally recognize gay people as human beings. Yeah, I got marriage -- and I'm still waiting for a pot to piss in. Love wins, but it better hope it can hold it until it's home! God bless freedom, God bless America, and god fucking dammit I have to pee.


I am angry and scared all the time. I hate myself for not being strong enough to just deal with it and push forward. Finish this journey. I am so far in the weeds, so lost. I'm looking for a home I've never known. I've dealt with abuse, self-harm, there's not a single particle, not a shred of my life that this doesn't touch and what's left of me is just a mass of scar tissue inside and out. Other people fight for their ideals, or to get back what they had. Me? I'm fighting because I don't know how to do anything else.


But tell me your opinion one more time. How you're the victim. Or how you're trying to help. Either way just keep talking, don't even stop to inhale, because otherwise you might accidentally listen and feel something that isn't in your playbook. And my wouldn't that be uncomfortable. And because I'm nice, but mostly because it's easier for me too, I won't say anything. I won't tell you any of this. And after awhile I'm not sure what's real anymore, and I don't really care, just please keep talking because it's better than being alone. I might not be a person when I'm with you but at least I'm not alone with myself. It's dying the death of a thousand paper cuts.


It sounds bad. It is bad. None of this should be happening, but it has, it is. But there's something else going on underneath it all. I still keep reaching up. I don't even know why anymore. 


I see someone who looks stressed, or sad, and I say hello, listen, give them a hug. I tell my mom I love her because I do, however complicated it is. I stop and pickup the discarded trash on the roads around work, not because I want to instagram it but because me and the trash have an accord. I'm still fighting the hatred and discomforting quiet of others. Even though to many of them I'm no different than the cigarette butts and fast food wrappers balled up in my fists. And the world is a little better for it.


A friend comes home and she's busted up about her boy. Asks me to cuddle her awhile. She falls asleep. Then she wakes up, rolls over, and sobs into my arms. And I just hold her, and rub her hair again, until she falls asleep. I don't know what I'm doing, I just remember all the nights alone growing up when I put my arms around myself and imagined someone holding me. I don't ask for myself, and nobody's going to do it to me. And it doesn't matter. The world is a little better for it.


I'm so scared every time I walk out the front door. My finger stops over the dial button and I just... can't... make it touch. And that night I'll lay in bed and rip myself to pieces because it's just another wasted day where I could have done something, but no. I was too pathetic again. So I get up, I login, chat with people and touch a life a world away, and they message me back: ""Thank you."" Now I can sleep. The world is a little better for it. 


I see the scars and deepening lines in a face. I see anger and fear in eyes that aren't mine. I see I have destroyed a life to live in the reflections passing by. I did not choose this. If someone came now who could make it all go away I would drop like a beggar. Please, I would ask -- please take me away from this world. I have prayed, and cried, and screamed, and endured because I had no choice. But how else could I worship this world I am trying so hard to love? 


Yes, I am ashamed. I'm ashamed because of what I've had to do, what I've had to become, to survive in this world. I'm ashamed to love a world like this. I don't want to be a judge. I don't know who's right. Certainly not me. They tell me be a man. They tell me be a woman. They tell me it's a choice, or that it's not a choice. I've believed both. And neither. I've tried to reason with it, come to terms with it, only to find it's still there. 


I remember in school once asking what fire was; A solid, liquid, or gas? I was told it wasn't any of those things; It was something that happens to something else -- A force of nature. That's what it feels like. I'm something that *happens* to other people.",genderqueer,"Anatomy of a culture war (TW: violence, abuse)",1559275245.0,"{'created_utc': 1559250045, 'id': 'buyhnx', 'num_comments': 4, 'score': 12, 'selftext': 'Today a story bubbled up out of T_D about a gender fluid school shooter, which made it to /r/all before getting deleted because the headline was misleading. Claims of a coverup now abound. Last week they closed a school because some 12 year old trans kid was a victim of a witchhunt. They were going to kill that child. Silence. The week before some asshat with alphabet soup at the end of his name got banned off Twitter and a bunch of people lost their minds; A doctor trying to weave a narrative that supported transphobic views with a bunch of half-truths and pseudo-intellectual crap. People cried censorship and ignored what happened when they didn\'t put a lid on this shit last time; Antivaxxers and a literal plague. He\'s still out there practicing medicine. \n\n\nThe week before that -- you know what, it\'s every week. It\'s been every week for years now. Imagine a boot stomping someone in the cunt every week forever. That\'s me. I\'m under that boot. Society has gotten ugly, and it\'s violent, and every last one of them believe they\'re on the right side of justice, god, logic, or... whatever. I don\'t want to be right -- I just want to stop getting kicked. There are no sides in this war I want to be on. \n\n\nPeople on the left (I\'ll get to the right too -- I\'m eo/aa/omgwtfbbq) are all about raising awareness, inclusiveness, and tolerance. Which is fine and dandy up to the part where they\'re so open minded they actually believe there\'s a million genders, think putting \'preferred pronouns\' on our introduction name tags is thoughtful instead of horrifyingly deaf, and get so busy virtue signaling with each other they fail to notice. I\'ve actually had them correct me -- on how to refer to myself, or tell me how to think about myself. I get told all the time I shouldn\'t be friends with people who don\'t ""accept you for who you are"" -- as if they have any business telling me who I get to associate with. How is that inclusive? I can respect the intention -- but not the result. \n\n\nNot to be outdone, I\'m a punching bag for the right. All of us are little anti-christs running around murdering and pillaging decent society with our wicked queer ways. We\'re what they point to when they spit and say ""political correctness."" We\'re the punchline for the big bad ""liberal"" agenda, and they will unload dump trucks full of bullshit they think is ""logic"". It\'s half-baked verbal diarrhea about chromosomes and biology and no matter how many arguments are demolished they\'ve got another lined up fresh from the vast ghetto of social fucking media. \n\n\nIt\'s all just rationalizing deeply felt anxieties about the future, the unknown, ""those people"". They live in constant fear, all their media screams and gushes out fear. Their amygdala has a taser shoved in it. They think facts and truth are discovered once, and then need never be investigated again. Yet they\'ll believe a screaming fat guy pushing herbal remedies talking about how the government is turning the frogs gay. Or tell us not to ""flaunt"" our gayness when we wear a rainbow pin as they drive by in their jacked up coal burner with a ten foot wide American flag stapled to its ass, two silhouettes of women in bikinis stuck to the back window, and red white and blue truck balls. Facts and logic though, right? Free speech but only in the comfortable, designated areas picked far out of view. \n\n\nThe two sides both point the finger at each other; All *I\'m* getting is the finger. \n\n\nEveryday I wake up and open up my dresser and I make a choice about how much I want to be abused. Wear jeans and a t-shirt and I\'m a guy until people are standing next to me in line and notice the bra lines. Wear a dress and I\'m the tranny and parents try to awkwardly shovel their kids out of the aisle when all I\'m there for is some flavor of ramen. But don\'t worry -- they all like Ellen on TV and have a gay neighbor so it\'s cool, right? \n\n\nI have my breakfast -- a handful of pills and that\'s usually it. I go to the grocery store about once a month maybe and I\'ve lost over 50 pounds in the last year because it\'s easier to just not eat than deal with people. That\'s not the only reason though -- I work in a restaurant, it\'s just I\'m so anxious all the time I don\'t have an appetite and can\'t eat more than a handful of anything at a time or it\'s a visit to the porcelain goddess. \n\n\nAnd I know it\'s a problem -- the doctors just turn me away and tell me it\'s a problem best solved in therapy. I\'ve already got another pointless appointment for next week to tell another one I\'m actually totally fine and nothing is wrong... I\'m just here to generate revenue. You want to know what queer people talk about after group therapy is over and the therapists leave? It\'s how to lie to them to jump through all the hoops. It\'s insane that so many people have to lie to fit into a narrative about them that grew up out of the culture of 40 years ago and expected to do that in the culture of today. And ironically, it\'s considered socially *progressive* they get treated at all.\n\n\nHundreds of experts with degrees and piles of studies and books in little rooms all over America are so utterly divorced from the reality of what their patients are going through it\'s heartbreaking. For a lot of people, ""do no harm"" may as well be ""do nothing at all"". The sad truth is, they\'re scared of the general public too. Scared they\'ll be sued, or arrested -- and I\'m not gonna sit here and tell them they should be brave and do what is necessary when I\'m locking myself in gas station bathrooms and passing out facing the same shit.\n\n\nThe doctor\'s office has become a political office where they prescribe thoughts and prayers instead of medicine for too many people. I don\'t know anyone I haven\'t had to say ""You just gotta keep trying until you find someone who gets it."" Honestly... a lot of people just give up and live in misery until depression catches up to them and they check out. Oh, it\'s so sad, but you know, there was nothing anyone could do. Except, you know, treat them as patients... or even just human beings. \n\n\nI go to work and I see the men talking with the men, and the women with the women, and nobody\'s talking to me because I\'m not really either to them. Oh, they\'re polite, it\'s just that everyone is more comfortable with me not existing so I quite conveniently went ahead and did that. It\'s nice when people remember the right pronouns, but speaking for myself it doesn\'t mean a whole lot if nobody\'s comfortable enough to actually talk to me. I mean, I can start conversations with them but the reverse doesn\'t happen. I make friends with people -- they don\'t make friends with me. Almost nobody initiates. That\'s the daily reality of this culture war. And even within our community, we\'re often too uncomfortable with each other because there\'s no scripts to follow.\n\n\nAn endless war\n_________\n\n\n\nDriving home it\'s just the music cranked up and stuffing the memories. Mom still can\'t say \'daughter\' after fuck-all years but progress because now I\'m just the ""older child"", ""sibling"", or whatever. She calls once every few weeks to see if I\'m still alive, say she loves me. Offers to help with the job search with a few bucks for a certification. Forgets she tried charging rent and said she wouldn\'t help with college after I came out. Forgets she\'s gone back on pretty much every promise she\'s made. Like everyone else. I tell her I love her too and hangup the phone, because against my better judgement every day I still want a family. And I wish I could have one of my own, but I\'m too old, I\'m sterile, and finding someone is a minefield of problems I\'ve dealt with one too many times and I don\'t think I can trust anyone again. As far as romance is concerned, being in between is being nowhere at all.\n\n\nThis is the shit people don\'t want to talk about. It\'s easy to reduce someone to an object, an abstract. It\'s easy to make it political. Too easy. We even do it to ourselves, with the best intentions. It\'s the greatest trick of modern society that we\'re all individuals, and we\'ve got freedom, and we\'re just so star spangled awesome -- just don\'t hug. Don\'t make eye contact. This is a country where we made corporations people years before we were willing to legally recognize gay people as human beings. Yeah, I got marriage -- and I\'m still waiting for a pot to piss in. Love wins, but it better hope it can hold it until it\'s home! God bless freedom, God bless America, and god fucking dammit I have to pee.\n\n\nI am angry and scared all the time. I hate myself for not being strong enough to just deal with it and push forward. Finish this journey. I am so far in the weeds, so lost. I\'m looking for a home I\'ve never known. I\'ve dealt with abuse, self-harm, there\'s not a single particle, not a shred of my life that this doesn\'t touch and what\'s left of me is just a mass of scar tissue inside and out. Other people fight for their ideals, or to get back what they had. Me? I\'m fighting because I don\'t know how to do anything else.\n\n\nBut tell me your opinion one more time. How you\'re the victim. Or how you\'re trying to help. Either way just keep talking, don\'t even stop to inhale, because otherwise you might accidentally listen and feel something that isn\'t in your playbook. And my wouldn\'t that be uncomfortable. And because I\'m nice, but mostly because it\'s easier for me too, I won\'t say anything. I won\'t tell you any of this. And after awhile I\'m not sure what\'s real anymore, and I don\'t really care, just please keep talking because it\'s better than being alone. I might not be a person when I\'m with you but at least I\'m not alone with myself. It\'s dying the death of a thousand paper cuts.\n\n\nIt sounds bad. It is bad. None of this should be happening, but it has, it is. But there\'s something else going on underneath it all. I still keep reaching up. I don\'t even know why anymore. \n\n\nI see someone who looks stressed, or sad, and I say hello, listen, give them a hug. I tell my mom I love her because I do, however complicated it is. I stop and pickup the discarded trash on the roads around work, not because I want to instagram it but because me and the trash have an accord. I\'m still fighting the hatred and discomforting quiet of others. Even though to many of them I\'m no different than the cigarette butts and fast food wrappers balled up in my fists. And the world is a little better for it.\n\n\nA friend comes home and she\'s busted up about her boy. Asks me to cuddle her awhile. She falls asleep. Then she wakes up, rolls over, and sobs into my arms. And I just hold her, and rub her hair again, until she falls asleep. I don\'t know what I\'m doing, I just remember all the nights alone growing up when I put my arms around myself and imagined someone holding me. I don\'t ask for myself, and nobody\'s going to do it to me. And it doesn\'t matter. The world is a little better for it.\n\n\nI\'m so scared every time I walk out the front door. My finger stops over the dial button and I just... can\'t... make it touch. And that night I\'ll lay in bed and rip myself to pieces because it\'s just another wasted day where I could have done something, but no. I was too pathetic again.
