2019-12-01 01:06:34,e472qt,19,1,"I am male in the sense that I was born with a penis. But I've always wanted to be female. Literally when I was a little kid I had a baby doll that I'd carry around and pretend to breastfeed and all that. I have always enjoyed the company of women more than men, and not in a sexual way.

For my next point I should mention I am pansexual. I often find myself looking at beautiful women. Not in a creepy stalkerish way, but when I see a woman who I find beautiful I genuinely look at her for a moment before moving on. Since I am attracted to women I always just assumed that I was checking them out and whatever. However, I recently noticed that I'm not often fantasizing about touching them or dating them but instead BEING them. When I check out a woman's body I don't start undressing them with my eyes I just get kinda jealous. I feel like I want to look like that but I can't. Yes, sometimes I am sincerely checking a girl out the way you'd expect, but usually it's not like that.

I recently experimented with makeup and women's clothing and I loved both experiences. The only thing that ruined it was once I started getting used to the feeling I was overwhelmed with a sense of anxiety and insecurity. I was afraid of what would happen if someone saw me.

This has been going on for some time now, but why I felt compelled to post this is because this past week I've felt very uncomfortable with myself. I can barely sleep and I can't focus on anything at all. I'm also, and not to be crude, excessively horny, which I don't know if it's related or not. All I know is I've been so distracted and confused that I can't even begin to think about satisfying my urges so now I'm sexually frustrated on top of already being uncomfortable all the time. It's really interfering with my life.

So to those who have read this the whole way, thank you. And now I have a question. Based on what you have been told, does this seem like someone who is a girl trapped in a man's body, or does it seem more like a man who is confused and maybe has an obsession with the female body? Or is it something completely different? I don't love talking about myself this much so please be nice.

2019-12-02 04:16:31,e4ti5m,0,1,"So I’m AFAB, and I’ve always been pretty tomboyish. As soon as I was old enough to dress myself, I stopped wearing dresses and skirts. I’ve always liked to crossdress and such, one very particular instance comes to mind when I was about six: I put on the most boyish outfit I had and tucked my hair up into a baseball hat. I wanted to look like a boy. I wanted to be called he by the other kids at the YMCA. And, most pressing, I remember the disappointment when my mom got confused and told me I still looked like a girl, and that I was always going to be her little girl. My whole life I’ve tried to stuff myself into this box that I’ve never quite fit in. I would get excluded from the games I wanted to play as a kid because none of the boys wanted cooties. No boy would dare letting me use their beyblade in a battle- and of course I couldn’t get my own, it was a “boy’s toy” after all. I just figured myself a tomboy and went on with my life. I tried to dress more feminine in middle school, I got cute pink locker decorations, I tried the whole “makeup” thing. One day, I even got my first period. I was horrified. I knew it was coming, but it actually happening was way, way worse than reading about it. The worst part though, was when my mom thought it was so great, when she was so happy for me, when she told me I was growing into a woman. She then told me to “stop making that face”- I was so visibly disgusted by the prospect. I’ve never liked my body too much either. I have trouble deciphering between actual dysphoria and just general dysmorphia, though. I’ve struggled with eating disorders and such over the years. I never know if my need to be skinny is just about losing weight or if it’s also fueled by my desire for an androgynous figure. I distinctly remember in homeroom one day, freshman year of high school, having a heated conversation with a more conservative friend of mine- the topic of the conversation has now long faded from my memory but the words I had said have not. I told her I hated my body, I hated my role in society, and I wished things were different, I wished I was different, but I wasn’t trans, I had said. I couldn’t be trans. That was something you knew from a young age, right? Besides, I had told myself, I like makeup! My room was distinctly feminine for a very long time and I had no problem with it! However, makeup feels more like playing dress up than anything, and I only ever do it for special events or if I want to try something fun and creative. My room was pink because that was the room I grew up in. Early sophomore year of high school I came to the conclusion that I must be nonbinary. (I never told anyone or changed my pronouns IRL, but I put they/them in most online bios.) I wanted top surgery and t, but I didn’t really want to be a guy, right? It was just for the muscles and increased metabolism, I convinced myself. I’m extremely envious of guys- I have trouble deciphering being attracted to them versus wanting to be them a good chunk of the time. When my mom wants me to help her do the dishes instead of fraternize with the guys around because it‘s “woman’s work” makes me incredibly angry, but I don’t know if it’s because I tend to be feminist or because I don’t like being singled out. I always feel like a fraud when I’m doing “girls-only” things. I’m also terrified of confrontation and such- a social or physical transition would bring a hell of a lot of unwanted attention to me, and I’m afraid that if I commit to something and then later decide it’s not right I’ll get attacked for it. I just perpetually wanna cut my hair off and move somewhere no one knows my name. (I had really short hair once! I loved it, and people accidentally called me sir at work a lot which I enjoyed but my mother told me I looked like an ugly boy so I grew it out) I’m always flip flopping between “Oh!

---

Hey friends. I've been doing a lot of thinking about gender identity lately and am still knee-deep wading through the murky waters of it all. (For context, I'm mid-20s and AMAB.) I don't think I'm ready to really adopt a label of ""nonbinary"" yet (and I don't know how actually much this – or labels at all, or pronouns, or *words* in general – actually serve to help me or do any work for me personally, though they can help make certain ideas… coalesce, or feel more real) but I do feel NB-ish. I say this as a lot lot lot of stories I hear from NB folks resonate with me in a lot of key ways, and when I hear or read about people who identify as NB, genderqueer, etc. talk about their ideas, concepts, and experiences with gender identity, I feel there's a lot in common, especially in this whole process of questioning and figuring these sorts of things out. So – while I could go ahead decide to call myself ""nonbinary"" right at this moment, sure – at the end of the day I don't think that would do enough to help me figure stuff out; I think this doesn't change anything, as it doesn't help me with my conception/relation to my own gender identity or what that actually *is*.

The whole ""not feeling nonbinary *enough*"" thing is extremely real for me, I think. I'm AMAB, and still think of myself as sort of ""weakly male"" (?) – I guess because at the least I've just been so used to that as the unquestioned norm for so long, despite never thinking of my ""maleness"" (in my own conception of it, pretty far from anything stereotypical though, which I've always been aware + pretty proud of) as really part of who I am as a person at all… Anyway, in regards to being AMAB, I'm finding it hard, as far as gender *presentation* goes, to actually *present* less male just because, for people designated or viewed as male, and because of society/history/culture, maleness – not some conception of ""neutral"" – is the default.

I don't want to perform stereotypical femininity by painting my nails or wearing dresses or earrings/jewelry or stuff like that (and I sadly can't grow out my hair either even if I wanted to try that out), I just want to… take away some of that masculinity. To quote the graphic novel _Gender Queer: a memoir_ by Maia Kobabe (which I only discovered after having essentially all these exact same thoughts myself months prior): ""I don't want *more* gendered traits, I want *less*."" But unfortunately I really don't think there's a way to do this because any gap or ""lack"" of gendered traits *is* the same as that default-maleness, for someone AMAB, or viewed to be as such + ""filled in"" with that.

It'd be great if I could look more androgynous (even though that in itself feels sort of ashamedly like ""playing the game you claim you don't want to be a part of"") but it seems mostly unachievable for me, so oh well. I do think people AFAB have a lot more flexibility to perform/express gender in a range of different ways (and that are more socially accepted too, although I know this doesn't really matter, but interesting to note) and I sometimes feel a bit jealous of that.

This all sort of connects to my main point or question which is that I'm wondering if anyone else, in some way, relates to the phrase ""I'm an [insert whatever here] who wants to be to be a girl who wants to be a boy,"" or finds that somehow productive in describing their feelings. Or flip those two genders, whatever. This is a little weird because I recognize it's dealing with some pretty binary views of gender, more than I usually think of it as (which is why I find some trans spaces, especially IRL, not… super relevant to my experiences, with MtF or FtM as common experiences that feel a lot… neater, or easier to describe + imagine, in some ways). However, there's some work this statement is doing in exploring identity and desire together, and wanting to (comfortably) be in this sort of in-between or maybe-not-quite-perfectly-achievable state…?

I'm also reminded of this quote from Jeanette Winterson's _Why be Happy When You Could be Normal?_: ""My sense of myself as being a girl who’s a boy who’s a boy who’s a girl. A doubleness at the heart of things."" Not exactly the same, but playing with this same sort of back-and-forth concept, I think. There's also a mention in one of the stories in _Nonbinary: Memoirs of Gender and Identity_ (yes, I've been doing a lot of reading, lol) where the author describes someone as ""a tomboy in a man's body"" which makes me feel maybe this isn't some too-weird, abnormal thought.

Sorry for the huge wall of text! Really did not mean to type this much, oops. Essentially any thoughts about **any** of this are super super appreciated. I don't even know *if* I feel stuck, or confused, or lost, or what – or if I'm sort of OK with that, in this hazy, liminal state – but I definitely want to make more sense of this all and talking with others or just reading about others' experiences helps a lot.

2019-12-03 15:38:29,e5itp9,15,1,"Ok brief background in why im asking this,

This  week my girlfriend has started talking about the fact that shes been questioning her gender identity these past few months, i knew something was up, and that shed started seeing a therapist through some lgbt network recently, but i didnt know it had anything to do with gender identity, and it came, quite frankly, as a very big surprise. 

Im honestly a bit lost right now and am not sure what to really do with that information yet as she seems very set on keeping all of this to herself until shes finished her own journey on thinking this over and comming to terms with whatever shes feeling right now. 

BUT i want to help make her feel better somehow . and so another aspect of whats been troubling her recently is her style of dress so i suggested doing a sort of ""queer eye"" thing where we go through her wardrobe, throw out everything old and ill fitting and then go on a massive shopping spree, probably buying some more a-gender style clothing that she might be more comfortable with. 

I offered to try and source together a big collection of reference images of outfits and styles she might like to guide us on our shopping quest, but this is where i need your help, cause im not finding it very easy to find looks shes into, so....

tl/dr

Would anyone here be willing to share some of their super cool gender queer clothing looks that they rock? or different style references/models i can find online?

Shes 28, and is looking for a style more ""professional"" than the wardrobe she currently has. She likes jumpers, neutral colours and looking like an adult.

I haven't considered it until very recently, but when I was about 5 or 6 years old I did show signs that I wasn't fully male. Sometimes I would put on my sister's Disney princess costumes and hide from my parents, just because I liked the way it made me feel. For whatever reason, I also assumed that everyone switched genders halfway through their life, which was probably an indication of what I hoped would happen to me. Even one day in the first grade, I told two of my friends that I was ""half-girl"". They didn't seem to take me seriously and I kind of forgot about it.

I'm not an expert on the relationship between gender and sexuality, but based on my experiences, I can tell they're closely linked. At least for me. I'm attracted to girls, so on the surface I'm a straight guy. But being a straight guy always felt uncomfortable to me, like something I should be ashamed of. In fact, over the past year or so I've wished I was bisexual on multiple occasions. I've tried to convince myself that I'm attracted to guys as well as girls, because I feel like bisexuality suits me better as a person than heterosexuality. I know how much stigma there is against bisexuals, so a ""straight guy"" wishing to be bi doesn't really make any sense. But I did. That's how I felt.

As soon as I accepted the fact that I'm not bi, and I can't force myself to be bi, I realized that maybe my discomfort lies not in my sexuality but in my gender. About two months ago, during a long shower, the memories I previously mentioned came back to me, and I thought maybe I was a trans girl. But I don't think so, because I do feel male, just not completely. I also wondered if I was bigender, both male and female. I still think there's a chance this might be the case, but at the moment, I feel like the ""demiboy"" label fits me the best. I'm pretty sure that I'm part male and part something else, I'm just not sure if that ""something else"" is female or if it's agender.

I'm not out to anyone yet. Until recently I've never thought I would need to ""come out"" as anything. And I'm scared. I have one friend who I know is going to be completely accepting of it, and I plan on telling her first. My other best friends will be open to it, but I'm most worried that they won't understand, or they'll think I'm joking, or they'll treat me differently even if they aren't trying to. I wonder if it's even worth it.

Coming out to my parents is petrifying. They'll support me, but they'll have no clue what the hell I'm talking about. My dad will probably start watching everything he says to make sure he's not offending me. I can see it already. He'll call me his ""son"" with a little extra caution and I'll have to say ""it's okay dad I'm your son you can call me son"".

Okay, so I've been confused about my gender identity for years now, and am curious if anyone can relate to my experience. 

I'm AMAB. I present mainly male but have a fairly androgynous look (long hair, soft features). I get both ""sir""ed and ""ma'am""ed from strangers. 

Socially, I have a hard time neatly fitting into a binary gender role. My mannerisms are neutral/femme and I feel most comfortable in the company of woman or NB folk. The idea of facial hair makes me very uncomfortable. Literally everyone I've dated has been or has later turned out to be queer/trans. 

But on the other hand, I have ZERO genital dysphoria and enjoy occupying a masculine role during sex. Many of my interests/hobbies are dude-centric. As a child I dressed up in princess outfits and had female alter egos, but even then I've never really seen myself as ""more"" female than male.

I've ID'd as non-binary in the past, but it almost feels silly using that label when a lot of my ""cisness"" don't really bother me. But I don't really feel ""all the way"" cis, either.

2019-12-08 23:58:10,e81qnw,6,1,"Here's a small story: A few weeks ago I went out of town with some friends. My anxiety was up, for work and personal reasons, and I was looking forward to (and dreading) a long trip back to my home state. Because I'm terrible at domestic chores I didn't have any clean laundry and I was desperate for some clean socks, so on the way home from work I stopped at a store to pick up a few pairs. I was particularly anxious that day and as I got a pair of socks I normally would I also saw a feminine pair that for some reason really called out to me, and not in a quiet or coaxing way. More like a desperate ""you want these socks!"" cutting through my body like a machete. They weren't particularly interesting, either. Just normal women's socks. The intensity of the urge was enough that I bought them without thinking about it overmuch, got home, and put them on.

That one simple, utterly inconsequential act eased my anxiety and dread. It was very nice. I had a great weekend with my friends, felt what one might even call *euphoria*. The implications of this have been settling over me, and I confess that I'm not really sure what it means. The desire--much less intense than during that moment in the store--has been growing to do it again. To, dare I say, go even further. I've been saying that I need to get my hair cut for weeks, but I keep putting it off, because now I'm curious to see what it will look like if I let it grow. I want to implement better skin care on my face so it will look softer and nicer. Etc.

I'm pretty sure I'm not trans, at least not in a binary way. I don't feel any discomfort presenting as male, and I often enjoy it. Nor do I think this is a fetishistic thing, despite there being a cross-dressing component. There was no erotic impulse when I wore the socks nor is there when I think about the other stuff. I'm a pretty sexual person in general, but for the most part none of this is coming from a sexual place. I don't really know what it is or where it's coming from. It's like I was in my house and I stumbled upon a door I had never noticed before, opened it, and found and entire unused wing just sitting there being ignored.

I was assigned the name lucas at birth, but some time ago, I started asking people I came out to, to call me luka. However I am not transgender, and instead identify as genderfluid, because I do not want to completely undergo a sex change. 
I am currently trying to give off a more feminine feel, and have a more effeminate look, but because of the school workload, I do not have much time to do this, along with fear of my parents finding out, both about my sexuality and my gender identity. 
Could any of you recommend some feminine styles of clothing that lean more toward androgynous than to a ""proper lady"" kind of dress? (eg. white tees with skinny jeans or blazers and leather jackets and scarves) 
By the way, can any of you recommend some estrogen hormone pills to appear more feminine and reduce body hair? I really appreciate it.

I'm a cis presenting afab that has struggled with my sexuality for most of my life and questioned my gender for the first time about 9 years ago. I hadn't really thought about it except in rare, fleeting moments since then until recently. I'm in a new relationship after a long break from dating and I think it's possibly playing a role in it coming back up. 

So getting right to it. I wish I was a man sometimes. Either amab or brave enough to undergo transitioning. I don't hate being a woman, I just would prefer not to be one. I wish I could present as a man and be accepted as a man and date as a man. But does that mean I'm trans? At what point is wishful thinking something more? How do I know what's like ""dang, I'm a woman. that sucks."" vs ""I'm a man in a woman's body.""? Wouldn't I know if I was a man? I don't feel like a woman so I don't really know what gender feels like I guess. 

Some other noteworthy things I suppose. I'm indifferent to my genitals, but dislike having breasts. I greatly admire openly ftm people and want to know them more. I feel my best in masculine clothes and feel euphoric when I look ""boyish"". Someone told me I looked like a guy a few months back and it just made me really happy. It felt like such a great compliment. The only outright ""feminine"" thing about me is that I prefer long hair because it suits my face. If I thought I could pull it off I'd most likely cut it off though and my compromise is an undercut lol. 

Something else that might be worth mentioning is how gender plays a role in my sexuality. As a woman, I bounce between bi and lesbian. Just constantly questioning it but when I think about if I was a man, I know without a doubt I would be a straight man.  So that kinda sounds like I'm lesbian right? Except lesbian doesn't feel right.  No sexuality labels feel right as a woman and idk what that means.

2019-12-12 12:44:57,e9n38y,0,1,"It's the first sub where I found people who self perceive like myself (transmasc woman or I guess a genderqueer woman now). It just feels good not to be alone in it. But I'm scared. I live in Eastern Europe and I'm diagnosed as female to male transsexual (that's how they diagnose it here, not dysphoria but as transsexual). I'm currently on testosterone and had a bad time with one surgeon over not having legal sex change in documents, but pursuing top surgery (another surgeon office said it's totally normal to first get surgery so I will see the surgeon soon and have it!). My mother, whom I am not and never was on good terms with, knows I'm transitioning because I had a breakdown over it once. The thing is, she told everyone behind my back. So now everyone thinks I'm going to go full on male. But I'm a transmasc/gq woman who aims for androgyny, but also has sex dysphoria so I try to get surgeries. Being trans or GNC is hard in Eastern Europe. I'm getting shat on as it is. Plus transition is hard legally because they want me to change my sex marker, but I don't want to so I have to carefully navigate it. I doubt I'll be able to change my name here to my preferred one due to laws making it have to conform to names stereotypically associated with sex in documents. I want to move, but I'm afraid long term I will be denied bottom surgeries (I hope to get hysterectomy still here, but I'd like metoidioplasty and vaginectomy long-term) no matter where I go.

I don't know how to navigate society this way. I get more interest when I'm assumed male and when I put myself as male into dating apps. But at the same time in everyday life I don't get to be assumed male anymore and I started testosterone. Pre-T I got people thinking I'm male despite my voice and now (to be fair, my voice didn't change much if at all) no one does. Nothing about me changed. I twice passed as male with long hair despite having a very feminine figure. Not being insta assumed to be female was a huge confidence boost for me as I really enjoy perceiving myself as androgynous. It's a really cool 'gotcha' when people think I'm a man, but I'm just a gq woman. It made me even more insecure with surgeons asking me to change my legal sex, because that'd be so awful to navigate if I don't pass. I assume it's because I don't interact much with new people and when I do, they're always linked to people who met me before so they can tell them. But I miss it so much. Being androgynous to a point where people can't tell is the way I feel the most confident and idk even why. Idk what to do. Wanting to go by a stereotypical male name doesn't help either. And concept of gq isn't here either.

So now everyone thinks I'm going to go full on male. But I'm a transmasc/gq woman who aims for androgyny, but also has sex dysphoria so I try to get surgeries. Being trans or GNC is hard in Eastern Europe. I'm getting shat on as it is. Plus transition is hard legally because they want me to change my sex marker, but I don't want to so I have to carefully navigate it. I doubt I'll be able to change my name here to my preferred one due to laws making it have to conform to names stereotypically associated with sex in documents. I want to move, but I'm afraid long term I will be denied bottom surgeries (I hope to get hysterectomy still here, but I'd like metoidioplasty and vaginectomy long-term) no matter where I go.\n\nI don't know how to navigate society this way. I get more interest when I'm assumed male and when I put myself as male into dating apps. But at the same time in everyday life I don't get to be assumed male anymore and I started testosterone. Pre-T I got people thinking I'm male despite my voice and now (to be fair, my voice didn't change much if at all) no one does. Nothing about me changed. I twice passed as male with long hair despite having a very feminine figure. Not being insta assumed to be female was a huge confidence boost for me as I really enjoy perceiving myself as androgynous. It's a really cool 'gotcha' when people think I'm a man, but I'm just a gq woman. It made me even more insecure with surgeons asking me to change my legal sex, because that'd be so awful to navigate if I don't pass. I assume it's because I don't interact much with new people and when I do, they're always linked to people who met me before so they can tell them. But I miss it so much. Being androgynous to a point where people can't tell is the way I feel the most confident and idk even why. Idk what to do. Wanting to go by a stereotypical male name doesn't help either. And concept of gq isn't here either. I just really wish I could get some surgeries here (the loan will surely be cheaper) and move and just... live without having to explain myself."", 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Bless this sub! +vent', 'created': 1576179897.0}"

Hi! So.. Yea, this is one of those ""am i faking it or am i really nb?"" posts. I'm so so sorry, you guys must have read thousands of those but I really need some advice on it and have nobody to talk to ):

So uh.. Ever since I learned about LGBTQ+ and identified and came out as bisexual cis woman... I was somewhat intrigued?? by trans identities, especially the ones out of binary genders. At first I thought NB meant only ""agender"" so I ruled out, but... There was ~something about it, and I kept following NB people, informing myself about it, fully convinced I was just a good ally. It took some research and when I found about the labels Genderfluid, Androgyne and especially Bigender suddenly things clicked... But I don't know what happened, because I was REALLY scared. Stepping outside of the binary and kind of coming out to myself only scared me to death, I swear I was shaking. I thought about what my boyfriend of four years would think (even though he is wonderful and always talks about me to others in gender neutral terms even though he has no clue about it). I thought about one of my best friends who used to be a TERF and now supposedly is not but probably keeps some of the ideology and will inevitably look at me like I was brainwashed.

Well, back then I decided to bury those ideas of being NB in the attic of my mind... But it only made me question even more the gender norms. I calmed down about it and remembered that I have always related to characters that could be somewhat gender neutral (Peter Pan, Link from TLoZ..) and have thought jokingly about being a boy.
But I kind of feel that I could be just making all this up to feel special...? I would never say nothing like that to other people, but whenever I call myself nonbinary or trans I feel like ""I just want to be different"". My trans friends all have dysphoria and suffering with transphobia and it really is NOT like I want to experience these terrible things, but I feel awful for ""faking"" it when people who are ""really that way"" go through bad things I don't go through. Again, I would NEVER say it to anyone, but when it comes to me.... ):

I really wanted to talk to my friends about how I experience my gender but I'm so SCARED of what they'll think. I started telling one of my friends about it and she was like ""oh you're a trans man then?"" and I swear I PANICKED and told her I was kind of both boy and girl...? I don't think she understood it and I'm really scared of talking about it again.

2019-12-13 15:00:38,ea515y,5,1,"I have been dating a cis man for the last three years. The last year of our relationship has been incredibly difficult due to both internal and external stressors: moving in together after being long distance for two years, him preparing for the Step 1 exam in medical school, me moving to be with him and starting a new job, me growing spiritually, etc. 

As part of that, I’ve also been questioning my career choices a lot and just generally growing in a lot of ways regarding my values and where I want to spend my time and energy in life. I also have OCD and switched up my meds in April and haven’t felt good about the new ones. I just switched again (yay!) but I know it will take awhile for the new ones to kick in. 

For the last 8-ish months or so, my libido has been nonexistent. I’m unsure if it has to do with my OCD meds, although the timeline lines up, so maybe. It could also be due to stress of moving, starting a new job, fighting with my boyfriend, growing pains, etc. However, I’m also wondering if it may have to do with my sexual orientation/gender? 

I’ve never been super girly, but lately I’m leaning more into a masculine aesthetic. And by that I really only mean pants and more tailored outfits rather than dresses and flowy tops, etc. I know I’m not trans, but I don’t really know how far my masculine aesthetic could go? I think I’m in the process of figuring it out. My partner hasn’t noticed and I honestly don’t think he would care if I played around with my appearance.

He hasn’t set any limitations, but I feel like they are there. Doing this exploration while already being in a relationship just feels inherently limiting. But I don’t know if that’s actually true.

2019-12-17 07:23:30,ebsmeg,4,1,"For reference I was AMAB and I've been considering my gender identity to be more feminine (not sure if it's really 100% trans MTF yet!). So far by taking up She/Her pronouns online and assigning myself a new feminine name has been pretty awesome! I get so much joy from the fact that people refer to me as She/Her and by representing my self in a female manner.

I have also been trying to be more in tune with what causes my sense of dysphoria. In terms of physical dysphoria, each time I look at myself in the mirror I do get a sense of discomfort or ""disconnection"" with the way I look. I essentially am bearded and I have hair all over my body, common sense would say that I should shave all that off to present myself to be more feminine. But I actually am not sure if that's would make me feel better, in fact the prospect of that does kind of scare me. I don't think having hair all over my bothers me so much than as it would to those who are trans and I'm worried if I do shave it off, wouldn't like it at all.

Looking at myself naked does not really produce dysphoria in me either tbh. I always do this checkup before I take a shower. I'm not exactly sure why I do feel that discomfort when seeing my face close up, when looking shoulders down. It does not feel as odd. Though a recurring feature of what I assume to be dysphoria is that I like to imagine that I have female genitals in the area where my [perineum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perineum) is. I can't really explain why that is, but it very apparent throughout the day.  


But lemme tell ya, I get pretty annoyed/dysphoric when people use my dead-name and refer me to He/Him pronouns. I hate it so much more than my physical gender expression. Just seeing my dead-name or being referred to as a man bugs me out. Despite this, I kind of feel I do not to take up feminine clothes or even ""look female"" if that makes sense. Though I'm not sure if this stems from the fear of not ""passing"" or the potential blow-back I might have after coming out to my family.  


I have questions in regards to the situation I have described here:  


* How do I know if I want to be a ""woman"" or just be referred to as a ""feminine figure""?
* Is it possible to present oneself as masculine gender expression wise but ask people to refer me by feminine pronouns and names?
* How would I ""signal"" to people that I would rather be called by She/Her instead of He/Him despite being masculine looking?
   * Note: I was thinking of being called by They/Them but I don't really feel comfortable with that and I feel that I'm compromising my gender identity by doing so.
* Is it possibly to go on HRT without being ""socially out"" with my identity? Would my family notice any changes? Would I still look ""masculine"" on HRT if I don't present myself in a feminine way?
* How do I know that if physically representing myself in a feminine manner would be something I like? 
   * I know that in social terms, I want to be referred as a female. But I am admittedly hesitant on representing myself as a female, as I'm not sure I would like it.

So far by taking up She/Her pronouns online and assigning myself a new feminine name has been pretty awesome! I get so much joy from the fact that people refer to me as She/Her and by representing my self in a female manner.\n\nI have also been trying to be more in tune with what causes my sense of dysphoria. In terms of physical dysphoria, each time I look at myself in the mirror I do get a sense of discomfort or ""disconnection"" with the way I look. I essentially am bearded and I have hair all over my body, common sense would say that I should shave all that off to present myself to be more feminine. But I actually am not sure if that\'s would make me feel better, in fact the prospect of that does kind of scare me. I don\'t think having hair all over my bothers me so much than as it would to those who are trans and I\'m worried if I do shave it off, wouldn\'t like it at all.\n\nLooking at myself naked does not really produce dysphoria in me either tbh. I always do this checkup before I take a shower. I\'m not exactly sure why I do feel that discomfort when seeing my face close up, when looking shoulders down. It does not feel as odd. Though a recurring feature of what I assume to be dysphoria is that I like to imagine that I have female genitals in the area where my [perineum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perineum) is. I can\'t really explain why that is, but it very apparent throughout the day.  \n\n\nBut lemme tell ya, I get pretty annoyed/dysphoric when people use my dead-name and refer me to He/Him pronouns. I hate it so much more than my physical gender expression. Just seeing my dead-name or being referred to as a man bugs me out. Despite this, I kind of feel I do not to take up feminine clothes or even ""look female"" if that makes sense. Though I\'m not sure if this stems from the fear of not ""passing"" or the potential blow-back I might have after coming out to my family.  \n\n\nI have questions in regards to the situation I have described here:  \n\n\n* How do I know if I want to be a ""woman"" or just be referred to as a ""feminine figure""?\n* Is it possible to present oneself as masculine gender expression wise but ask people to refer me by feminine pronouns and names?\n* How would I ""signal"" to people that I would rather be called by She/Her instead of He/Him despite being masculine looking?\n   * Note: I was thinking of being called by They/Them but I don\'t really feel comfortable with that and I feel that I\'m compromising my gender identity by doing so.\n* Is it possibly to go on HRT without being ""socially out"" with my identity? Would my family notice any changes? Would I still look ""masculine"" on HRT if I don\'t present myself in a feminine way?\n* How do I know that if physically representing myself in a feminine manner would be something I like? \n   * I know that in social terms, I want to be referred as a female. But I am admittedly hesitant on representing myself as a female, as I\'m not sure I would like it. That\'s why I\'m even really hesitant shaving my body, as I\'m afraid I\'ll be getting rid of something I like.

I, support the directly affected individuals of LGBTQ+ discrimination and bullying in all communities. 
I, support the idea that, our communities are in need of stronger LGBTQ+ representative’s, resources, and outlets for LGBTQ+ identifying individuals. 
Especially for our diverse communities involving the LGBTQ+ sector. 
I, acknowledge discrimination and harassment in communities towards LGBTQ+ individuals. 
I, support Anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination, bullying, and abuse and want it to end.

I, support the idea of more resources; so that LGBTQ+ identifying individuals, can obtain such resources. 
Without being exposed to bias judgment and subject to humiliation, by figures who hold power in communities. 
I, oppose the abusive, and harassing actions shown in our communities towards LGBTQ+ and I stand for change!

My mission: To be a stronger representative for our LGBTQ+ communities. 
To be able to collaborate with community leaders and work towards solutions for the demand for support and outlets in communities.

2019-12-18 22:46:54,eck06g,0,1,"To start from the beginning, growing up I never felt like a girl. When I hit puberty I gained a lot of weight and it went straight to my hips. I had a fatass. People made fun if it. I have a hard time really remembering because of serious depression that also hit around puberty, but I think that I was experiencing some form of body dysphoria. I hated my name and pretty much all feminine aspects of myself.

I met a great guy (H) a couple years later and we've been together ever since. We've only ever been with each other. Sexuality wise I'm demisexual, which took a long time to realise that was a thing, I thought if anything I was ace but H was the only time I've ever wanted to do such things. During this time I felt so feminine and enjoyed it. I don't masturbate, it's like I can't emotionally commit to it.

Currently H and I are still together (almost a decade at this point) today I found out he watch's porn. I wasn't mad, a little hurt for just finding out now, but it sparked a good and healthy conversation with us. We talked about our sexualities. For him he is now just realising he is a sexual creature that has physical and emotional need and sometimes just physical needs. For me I have to have physical and emotional at the same time, or else I just can't do it. Realising that I'm not typical regurgitated all those awful feelings.

But this is what set me off to this horrible feeling about my body. I felt numb all over. I couldn't feel my boobs or ass and I was just a blank slate. It was just kinda like when I was younger. I wear dresses that flatter my waist and show an hourglass (ish) silhouette. But in that moment I realised I was using my t and a as accessories like I'm wearing a costume, pretending to be female. A lot of this barely makes sense to me so I hope I'm not offending anyone with these thoughts. 

I never liked my name because of how feminine it is and I was often made fun of as a child for having such an old fashioned and feminine name. I wish it was something more neutral. When thinking about myself in relation to H (he and I are a family and are engaged) I just think ""female"" and ""she/her"" and I'm okay with that. But when I think about myself in my own head I think **nothing**, there's just no way I know how to describe it. I don't think she/her but I don't know any pronouns that *make sense*.

I don't think I'm trans nor nonbinary. I just dont know. I bawled my eyes out and H and I talked for hours. He said no matter what he'll love and accept me and be with me every step of the way. I can't be androgynous  (I fricking wish, any time I see an androgynous character in media I get this weird happy feeling) because my body is stupid curvy (not trying to brag buying pants is hard).

I'm  new to this whole concept of genderfluidity. I think I've recently  figured out that I'm pansexual in the process of researching the topic  of gender identity and sexuality, and was hoping you might be able to  clear a few things up for me.

A  lot of what I feel to me seems just like acknowledging that gender norms  are kind of dumb. As a biological male I'd occasionally like to wear  nail polish or eye liner, but I don't know if I feel the desire to dress  as a woman. I also enjoy some activities that are sterotypically  female.

This is where it gets  confusing to me. A lot of the things that I feel are feminine about me  seem a lot less then what other people experience in posts that I've  read and so I'd feel a lot like I didn't belong and the last thing I  want to do is offend someone.

Backstory: About a month ago I was staying over at my girlfriend's house (we're a straight couple) and I ran out of underwear. She had me try on a pair of hers and I instantly loved it. Throughout the day I felt the need for more growing. As a child I wanted to find a girlfriend who would let me be like her when I wanted. She's supports the idea and actually loves the way I look in her underwear.

2019-12-28 01:33:23,egk79f,10,1,"Hey, I'm 23 and AMAB, and I'm really unsure if I'm a man or not. I've been going through a period recently where I want so bad to be more fem, wearing the clothes, the polish, the makeup, and seeing more curves and no bulge. I've had this feeling before, maybe a year or so ago, then again little more recently, where I faced out instead of always questioning it. I tried out presenting more fem, and it was nice, but then I just went back to being masc. It's almost like the desire faded.

But now it's back and I'm super confused, I wondered if I might be genderfluid. Which would be VERY inconvenient, considering I know this feeling will most likely change and I'll be happy identifying masc for another long period of time before having this....longing again. 

Then there's the matter of my partner. We've been together for a little over 4 years, we're engaged and they've always been immensely supportive of me in everything. They themselves are gender neutral/enby, and our relationship brings us both so much happiness. I truly love them and they love me so much also. But this matter of my masculinity and femininity is hard for them. They are not attracted to feminine men, they love the masc parts about myself and my body, and the last time I was presenting more fem, it was difficult for them to see those aspects of myself disappearing. I told them I was feeling very fem lataely, and we talked last night about it. They told me they loved me as a man. That me no longer being the person they fell in love with was a deal-breaker for them. 

I HAVE to stress, all of this was said calmly and with no intent to cause me hurt or guilt. I know a lot of this already, and I know it sounds like maybe my partner is being unfair or unsupportive, but they have a right to their own feelings and autonomy too. I want to respect that in whatever way I can, I don't hold that against them in the slightest. But I would be lying if I said it didn't make going through with some parts of presenting fem hard. I love this person more than anything, and I don't want to lose them over this, especially not when I'm positive I'm going to change again to feeling and presenting more masc.

They have suggested that I might be happy presenting more androgynous, seeing as I normally present very 'boring masc', which I readily agree with. I don't push gender roles, which may be why I feel the desire to go full fem when I feel like this. I just worry that when (not if, WHEN, I'm going to actually do it this time!) I've been presenting more andro for a while, I'll still feel that desire to go more fem, meaning I might have to consider the possibility of no longer being with the love of my life.

Anyway, I'm sorry for the immense post, I just really needed to get it out and hopefully hear some other people's opinions, especially anyone whose been in my position

When all else fails, pause and show gratitude. It can be intense when love, death, self-identification and sobriety find themselves at the same intersection within a short time period, that has been my lesson this year, but grace and levelheadedness is truly the only option. This year has stopped me in my tracks and forced me to halt the negative storyteller in my own head. The universe has aligned and given me the willpower and perspective to not only realize my missteps, but to understand the process necessary in correcting them. Its hard work. When the lights came on from my dark lifestyle  I found myself in a dirty room that needed cleaning. Sure, I wish I could call someone else to do the work; I wish I could clean the whole room in one afternoon, but that’s not possible and patience is key. Focus on the next task. Never forget to look back, pause and show gratitude for the progress made. 

Most of the time when I wake up from a dream there’s either relief that the the bad dream wasn’t true or disappointment that an amazing dream was simply that, a product of imagination. This year, however, I somehow caught myself off guard. On January 1, 2019 I decided to no longer drink, by August I found myself crying at the realization that my new reality reflected what, in the past, would have been called a dream: an unobtainable desire. My body had changed dramatically for the better. I had surrounded myself with friends and partners who understood my path and encouraged me to keep building. I no longer needed alcohol to silence negative self-talk, because for the first time I knew it wasn’t true. As I opened my heart and allowed the divine feminine energy of the universe to flow through me, rather than drowning or burying it, my own life fit me better. 

Whether it be on-line or in person, learning about the experiences of others was very meaningful as well. I’m very lucky to have surrounded myself with loving people that could relate to me deeply in different ways. Sometimes I’d feel crazy for feeling certain things: Then I’d have to remember that was the problem since the beginning. Truly deciding to not live my life off a map made of  other people’s expectations was a decision with results that felt physically liberating. Education felt like a validating foundation. Once I could identify the feelings inside with a word (a label), everything changed. Hearing others talk about their similar experiences made me feel less “crazy” for my actions. Not being mad at myself for past actions was also a lesson in self care and compassion. And again, always trying to remember to show gratitude for progress made. 

Within one month I was was my brothers best man and my Grandfather's pallbearer. The yin yang is a cliche at this point, but relevant non-the-less. Weddings are hard, expensive and stressful. “Showing up” for a loved one can sound easy on paper, but that’s about where it ends. The trick is to be present, truly present. Its hard to give a meaningful speech of you’re caught up in travel details, tux rental costs or nerves. The same to goes with grief. Sitting with loved ones and allowing yourself to feel can remind everyone involved of the magick they shared in the embodiment of a  loved one. Embrace the truth, be present, even if it hurts.

To be honest, I don’t know what I’m trying to do with these words. I just want you to know that you’re truly real magick. You’re made of space dust and represent the universe looking back at itself.

When I imagine myself as a guy I can't imagine being in relationship with anybody and I don't like that.

I was hoping to find shoes for NYE. It’s too late for that, just have to make do for now. I have some half-decent-if-I-clean-them-up Vans. Still, eventually, I’d like some nice dress shoes.
