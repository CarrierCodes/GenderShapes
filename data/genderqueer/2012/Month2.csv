2012-02-07 16:50:45,peu7m,3,8,"It's funny how after hours of thinking I can't think of a better description than ""a little bit weird guy"".

It's probably easiest to just say the definite facts. I'm a bisexual male, notably leaning toward females. And I don't think I have any problems being a guy, physically speaking.

But mentally, well, that's a different question with completely odd answers.

I'm starting to come to terms with the fact that I *have* such thing as a personality.

I could say that it's starting to become clear to me that I have kind of a division between what I physically am, and what I am as a creative entity. My physical side is just what it is. My creative self is just... being creative, I guess.

People probably say that I'm roleplaying or something. I think that's incorrect.

I am a *narrator figure.*

The biggest revelations I've had lately have all had to do with the fact that I'm a writer, and how everything has something to do with the fact. Looking back, I can see that I'm one walking the path of words. My mission in this life is to tell stories. My mission in this life is to provoke thoughts through commentary.

And authors are supposed to distance themselves from the works. Good stories stand on their own. Solid facts stand on their own. But that is not how tales are told. People, surprisingly enough, care about who the author is, even when that's completely irrelevant as far as the story goes.

Which is why I become a narrator of some description.

This is so deeply ingrained in my personality that I can't shake it. I take the garbs of a narrator to make my way through a situation in life. I *become* the narrator. I find it easier to tell some kinds of tales by being a guy. I find it easier to tell some kinds of tales by being a gals. And people may have their expectations of some tales being told by men or women, but that's somewhat irrelevant; I just have to tell what I feel, and those feelings are somehow related to the narrator figures.

And mind you, it's still the *same output*. I don't mean that my writing would be purposefully adapted to use male or female writer clichés. It's just that I get my mind to the proper gear and manage to be somehow perceived as *something*.

And I feel comfort *being* these narrator figures. I feel comfort in building these storyteller agents. And yes, *now* we can get back to the roleplaying discussions: I enjoy character design in all forms. ...Maybe it's easier to understand this way: if I design a RPG character, I put my soul into that process, much the same way I put my soul in my characters and narrator figures. These fictional folks *are* me. They're my lenses for seeing the world in thousands of ways.

I now realise what exactly I meant when I realised, long ago, that most of my characters in my fiction have to have a *little* bit of my personality in them. Not total Mary Sues, but *something* little that may remind people who wrote this crud.

The key word here is ""comfort"", though. It's strange. I've posted on some other forums and listed my gender as female. That's how I identified my narrator figure as. That's what I *am*. And somehow I find comfort in that. Much like how I found comfort writing a tale in which a protagonist is female. And sometimes, I can feel comfort in being listed as male or exploring how a male character is feeling in a story.

This is all becoming clearer now. I was once thinking that it was just my online identity having a bit of gender confusion going on, but now I think it's just getting clearer that it's all coming back to what I really am: Yet another human being who is driven to inform and entertain, and who somehow has to pick a gender when telling tales.

I used to think it's completely irrelevant who I am, but I'm beginning to think that it may put my mind at ease if I just think of myself as having narrator personalities. A final curveball coming up: I just don't know what it says of me that my favourite ""narrator personality"" is just this tomboy living in my head. Maybe this is how oddness was destined to be.

Finally, here's [A random drawing I made earlier](http://fav.me/d4bayyd). Before all these strange revelations. =)

2012-02-11 16:47:51,pkvnd,12,18,"I've recently, in the last two or three months, come to the conclusion that I'm genderqueer. I'm an extremely weird person by nature, and my ""gender identity"" shifts from the very femme to androgynous and even masculine seemingly at random. It's always how I've been, ever since I was very little - gender never made much sense to me, which is, I think, the only real nugget of wisdom my biological mother ever imparted on me.

Three and a half years ago I started medically transitioning. My body identity had always been primarily female, even with a fluid gender identity. Thankfully, my doctor had been exposed to enough of the downtown queer community to ""get it"" somewhat, and didn't mind that I wasn't a ""hardline"" trans woman, or that I dressed like a tomboy who didn't give a fuck. However, I was lost, and didn't know anything about anything, so she recommended me to a couple of trans groups. From there, I fell into a crowd of hardline trans women.

Big mistake.

At first they accepted me, and were even my friends. For a while, it was good. After a little while, though, the questions started coming out and they started asking me when I was going to get the surgery, why I wasn't dressing more femininely or wearing makeup, and so on. They warned me that my doctor may even strip my HRT away from me if I didn't ""smarten up"" and start being hardline right then and there. They told me being ""genderqueer"" is just what those 18 year old first-year college students taking Women's Studies do, and that it's just a fad/trend for them, and they'll NEVER understand what being a REAL transperson was. Hell, they even went after the people who used the term ""trans woman,"" because ""trans"" is a bad word that should be erased. 

They were extremely catty, and I'd even say abusive near the end. Unless I was going to go stealth, they didn't want to hear about it. Eventually, they betrayed me and hung me out to dry, but not before instilling a metric ton of internalized transphobia and queerphobia. For a while I was miserable. I wanted to present however I wanted, but I was TERRIFIED of my doctor revoking my HRT, or never qualifying for SRS since dressing like a tomboy wouldn't be considered ""full time,"" even though SRS was, originally, the last thing that was on my mind. At that point, I was feeling a lot of anxieties that weren't even mine. 

At Burning Man 2011, though, the few GQ people that I knew went completely naked... and nobody gave a fuck. In fact, some people came up to them and said their bravery was inspiring, knowing full well how society at large treats gender-variant people. Eventually, I went topless there, and stopped giving a fuck myself, and two and half years of emotional conditioning just kinda unravelled all at once.

So, at this point, I don't really care if I'm ""Trans Enough."" I also don't care if people consider me trendy - this is how I've felt for 14-15 years at this point, so fuck it. Is it even a trend anymore when it lasts a lifetime? I'm going to present however I like, dye my hair, not wear makeup, and use whatever pitch of voice feels comfortable for me at the time. I have more important things to do than constantly re-evaluate my gender presentation. 

I don't actually hate the trans women I used to hang out with. I know they have their problems, and that most of the vile crap they spewed at me was internalized transphobia as well.

I work for an online gaming site, and basically I'm in a room with about 200-odd people at any given time, trying to keep them entertained etc. This morning, shortly after arriving into work I was treated to a bunch of abuse off of some players after another Host called me a 'heshe' in chat.

I am Genderqueer, and have never said I am male or female on-site as it's never been brought up in the 2years I have been hosting. It went on for over an hour, being called a 'heshe' and a f'reak'/'weirdo' etc. It really, really got to me and I spent over 20mins in the toilets in tears. Turns out, 2 other members of staff had been calling me a 'heshe' to our members, finding it hilarious. I honestly don't know what to do. My boss isn't the most understanding person and I'm afraid if I say anything I will be reprimanded for it.

Sorry Reddit, I really don't know where else to turn.

EDIT: A member actually just came on-site to purposely find me and ask if I was okay, apparently she had been onto our website's FB group and it's all kicking off on there about me. Loads of members are sticking up for me, saying how these 2 members of staff should've have said what they did, and accusing them of bullying. I can't believe how much it has kicked off.

EDIT2: Thank you for all of your responses and kind words. I am off work now until Friday, but have agreed to go in if needed for a meeting or anything. I'll keep you guys updated with anything that happens.

UPDATE: I got pulled into a meeting yesterday to tell me that management ARE taking what happened very seriously, and when I'm back in on Tuesday I have a meeting with HR. Again, thanks for the kind, wise and supportive words Reddit.


EDIT 3: Well, after a week or so of being told ""It's being dealt with..."" I've been told that no action is being taken. I've asked why not, and I've been told because the guy in question said he was answering a question if I was male or female.
I hate myself for backing down, and I don't know how else to react, but yeah I've had to just let it go.
I've even moved onto the nightshift at work so I don't have to have much (if any) contact with him.

However, when they learned of my being genderqueer, they have been almost competing with me, and undercutting my gender identity regularly.

I also want to do something for the Genderqueer crowd, maybe find some way to make androgynous clothing. Any genderqueer people have suggestions as to what would make good clothing options?

2012-02-18 00:33:12,pumro,32,12,"I feel like I need help from people who might understand my gender better.  I talked about this with a friend, but all he did was tell me the side effects of anything I mentioned might help, but not things I necessarily want to do.

I guess, the easiest way to explain it is that I wish I was a hermaphrodite.  Instead, I'm female, genderfluid and, to put it simply, pansexual.  I'm sick of my female body, but the desire to be FtM isn't strong enough to seriously or jokingly consider it, especially since bottom surgery can't create functioning parts, it wouldn't be worth it to me.

She frequently says things like ""I wish I was a boy/I wish I looked like a boy."" She's very self-conscious about her height (I don't know her exact height but I'm 5'2"" and taller than her) and looks in ways that make it seem like she really resents the ""femininity"" traditionally associated with them. Today, she said she resents being identified as female. She said she ""knows"" she's female but finds it somewhat unpleasant or even offensive when another person comments on her gender. 

There are other times when she does seem to be receptive of female identity, though. She will sometimes (rarely) have a confident attitude towards feminine traits and female identity. When this happens I start to wonder if she would benefit from taking time to rethink gender, and possibly discover that she is another gender or even just rethinking what it means to her to be female. 

It seems like she is very upset a large portion of the time in relation to her experiences with gender. Much of this I presume has to do with her upbringing, as she has very conservative parents who have already given her a heaping load of bullshit over her bisexuality. I try not to be gender specific in general (I really only rarely find a need to be) and I am particularly sensitive around her because, well, it just seems like other people give her a hard time without even meaning to and I don't want to contribute to that.

The whole thing is and has been confusing for me, but at the same time, it makes me feel a lot better because it explains a lot of the ways I felt when I was a child, and it fits in with the fact that I've always felt like it wouldn't have mattered if I had been born a different gender because my gender and my sexuality (pansexual) would still be the same.

That being said, I'm not out of the closet yet and I am definitely not ready to come out of the closet for this. It took me a while to become comfortable enough with my sexuality to come out with that (and I'm out mostly as bisexual at that), and that's something that I feel like society understands a little bit more than gender identity. I present as one gender (female; I'm AFAB).

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I feel like people only give me space to either be masculine or feminine, and if I want to present a more masculine side of myself, I can't because people can't seem to understand the idea of being both masculine and feminine. Am I imagining this, or is this a legitimate thing? It's just so frustrating when the people in my life have a sort of ""well aren't you a cute little girl for trying to like manly things"" attitude when I'm as much of a man as I am a woman. Yeah, I have a very feminine figure and yeah, I like a lot of traditionally feminine things (dresses and makeup!), but I can still like those things and be masculine too. Is this a normal way to feel? And does it get any easier coming to terms with things like this?

I present as one gender (female; I\'m AFAB).\n\nI guess what I\'m trying to say is that I feel like people only give me space to either be masculine or feminine, and if I want to present a more masculine side of myself, I can\'t because people can\'t seem to understand the idea of being both masculine and feminine. Am I imagining this, or is this a legitimate thing? It\'s just so frustrating when the people in my life have a sort of ""well aren\'t you a cute little girl for trying to like manly things"" attitude when I\'m as much of a man as I am a woman. Yeah, I have a very feminine figure and yeah, I like a lot of traditionally feminine things (dresses and makeup!), but I can still like those things and be masculine too. Is this a normal way to feel? And does it get any easier coming to terms with things like this?\n\nI\'ve been lurking a bit on this sub and you guys have been really great about giving advice/being generally friendly to posters here. I hope you can do the same for me. I really, really appreciate it. Like I said, I\'m very closeted so I have no one to talk to about this, so it\'s rather isolating.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': ""It's like I'm not allowed to be both masculine and feminine, but I hate the idea of having to choose one.
