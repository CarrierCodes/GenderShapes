2012-03-05 17:43:11,qisw0,34,17,"Hello, everyone! Like it says on the tin; this thread is for discussing things around the subreddit. I've been lurking through a lot of the drama unfolding over on r/lgbt, and one of the sensible suggestions that seems to keep popping up is that there should be a posted, open, and available set of rules to act as a set of guidelines for both the readers and the mod team. 

Right now, the mod team's just me, but we are still growing and we might need a new mod sometime soon. As it stands presently, we grow a little more every day and the workload isn't very heavy, so I figure I'll open applications for another mod when we hit a milestone like 1000 readers. I am, of course, open to feedback on this idea.

Rules! Yes, back to the bit about posting some standardized rules. At the moment, we've only had one person come here and post nasty, hurtful comments. Even so, I'm tempted to message them and strive to *teach* rather than to dismiss. More to the point, however, about rules. What should our rules be? These are rules that would cover everyone, so as readers you would be able to call me on it if I should happen to goof up somewhere, too. Personally, I do like to give people second chances, just in case, and I've been playing things by ear: If someone says something hurtful and I catch it, then I'll ask them to cool it, and if they continue then things will progress to a warning or even a ban. I do take a harder line on slurs; I feel that using slurs is reprehensible, but we're got an awesome community here, and fortunately that hasn't been an issue.

Also, flair! Flair is kinda fun, and I've always thought it looks neat. Right now we've got text-based flair, and I've been working on how to figure out image-based flair for a little while. I do very much like [/r/ainbow](/r/ainbow)'s flag flair; it seems very sensible and professional. To be honest, though, I'm not exactly a fan of the genderqueer flag; I'll rally beneath it, but I just don't like the lavender and green combination. I need to ask the mods of [/r/ainbow](/r/ainbow) how they got image-based flair up and running... and also, [/r/mylittlepony](/r/mylittlepony) had a utility running that would allow users to assign their own, custom flair at one point. All you needed was a tiny image to upload... I think that would be useful, because then everyone could pick whatever they feel suits them best, even though it would mean more work for me. Personally, I like the idea of creating a post asking for art from our community. That would allow us to have flair made by us, for us; I feel that would really encourage community participation and it would make things a little more welcoming and homely around here. I encourage this board as a welcoming space, and I feel it would encourage pride in our board. (Because people could say ""See that flair right there? *I* made that. How cool is that?"")

In summation:

1. Rules and guidelines: Let's work out some sensible rules together.

2. New Moderator: I'm planning on opening applications for another moderator when we get to 1,000 readers.

3. Flair: What sort of flair should we have? Should we go with [/r/ainbow](/r/ainbow)'s flag flair? Should we enable custom user-generated flair? (This may take a little longer for me to enable.) Should we issue a call for artists to produce brand new flair just for our subreddit here?

4. Old business: As always, I am open to suggestions and criticisms, if you have an excellent idea on how we can improve something, please message me and let me know!

2012-03-10 06:14:36,qq0bw,3,5,"I'm a 22 year old American, and right now I identify as a trans* genderqueer butch person. I was assigned female at birth, identified as a transsexual man from the ages of 15-21, and after discovering that genderqueer is a thing, came to identify with that as a facet of my identity.

The thing is, there are a lot of things about my gender that I am uncertain of, and I would like some advice on how I might best proceed. (Also, my apologies if this is a bit obnoxious: I am slightly drunk at the moment.)

1. I changed my name legally when I was 20. I got the court order and everything. But while I liked the name at the time (my current legal name is something that I identified with since I first began identifying as transmasculine) it seems too gendered to me. I would like to go by something gender neutral. There is actually a name I have picked out, but I feel somewhat guilty and ridiculous asking people to learn/use yet another name and set of pronouns when I already asked them to do so three years ago. I don't want to change my name legally again, but I guess I'm asking, is it ok/normal/whatever to ask people to refer to me with ze/hir pronouns and a gender-neutral name, or should I just keep quiet and be grateful that they did a good job adopting a male name and he/him/his?  I think I might be genderfluid and while the ze/hir/hirs pronouns and gender neutral name give me a little more wiggle room in that regard, I am also worried that I might change my mind in another four years and be completely disregarded. 

2. I was assigned female at birth. I have never identified as a woman, though, and I stopped identifying as a man (what seems like) a long time ago. I am unusually tall though, heavyset, and quite butch looking. This tends to grant me a great deal of passing privilege, and I more or less get the privileges of appearing to be a heteronormative cisgender man even though I am none of those things. So I kind of want to cast those things aside and say no, I'm not a man, I'm not cis, and I'm not hetero... but I don't know how to go about that without appropriating the identities of other people.  Cis/trans* I'm not so worried about because I just frankly cannot imagine identifying as cis, even if I only fall under the trans umbrella because I'm genderqueer. But how can I own and celebrate my female-assigned body AND my nonbinary gender without invading spaces/invalidating identities of people who are female-assigned and/or female-identified?  To put it more clearly, I guess, I have absolutely no concept of what it means to be a woman, but I really don't want to be seen as a man, and I'm worried that if I wear a bra or speak up as a feminist or something I will just hurt women more. And it seems really shitty to like want to identify more strongly as nonbinary because I so hate being afforded male privilege and being seen as a threat and... ugh, I hate the patriarchy and don't want to be a part of it, but I'm also just genderqueer anyway I think, and I don't want to identify the ""wrong"" way or for the wrong reasons or hurt anybody.

That said, I present as my born sex, and am perfectly fine calling myself a girl, with others calling me a girl, dressing feminine, etc. But really, I don't identify with the concept of ""being a woman"" because, in my mind, I'm just a *person*; the core of what I am is in my brain, not the external bits I didn't have control over. I may dress feminine and wear makeup and enjoy doing it, but that's because that's what suits me aesthetically, and a lot of it is cultural, too, as this feminine thing is a pretty recent development for me. I feel like if I'd been born a dude, I'd probably be fine calling myself a dude and dressing masculine and enjoy doing that, too, but I'd still feel more like a brain than a gender. I don't gender my interests or activities. They're just what I like. I don't even really like terms like 'masculine' or 'feminine' for activities or interests or personalities or anything other than the physical, preferring instead terms like 'active' or 'passive.' I have trouble seeing people as 'a man' or 'a woman,' and just see them as.. well, people. 

If I could switch gender at will, I'd do it, provided I didn't have to stick to one. I think one body's handy for some purposes and experiences, and the other body's handy for others; I guess I just like the idea of experimenting with different perspectives. I don't feel attached to any one particular way of being.

Does anyone else feel like this? What is this? Is this what it is to be agender? Or am I bigender? Or androgynous? Do I have some kind of dissociation thing going on? Or am I just a girl? Is this how most (cis) people feel? Like a brain controlling some kind of biomecha? 

..Sounds a little weird now that I've written it down. I don't normally really think about it.

EDIT: And while I'm at it, I might as well go full weird on you - does anyone else find themselves looking at people and wondering how gender dynamics would work if, all of the sudden, we all had the same body, voice, and expressed body language (but the same internal gender/memories/etc.)? Sometimes I think people get so distracted by the exterior and attach themselves to it, when if you really listen to the message, each gender is basically saying and/or feeling the same thing, and it's the fact that we're so easily put off by external perception we end up with some pretty bizarre assumptions about what gender is.

..still don't know if any of that made any sense, but fuck it. Maybe someone else out there 'gets it.' Thoughts?

Sometimes I think people get so distracted by the exterior and attach themselves to it, when if you really listen to the message, each gender is basically saying and/or feeling the same thing, and it\'s the fact that we\'re so easily put off by external perception we end up with some pretty bizarre assumptions about what gender is.\n\n..still don\'t know if any of that made any sense, but fuck it.

Let me first state that I am not gender dysphoric; for me to have the confidence to let myself cross-dress I had to first really look at my body and realize that I really do like my male-body and I enjoy being male, whatever that means. 

What's got me thinking I am bigender is that when I am *en femme* there are subtle changes in the way I behave and think. I fold my underwear before putting it away, I think I move differently, I dance femininely, and I prefer music by female musicians. What's really got me freaked out is that when I am *en femme* I love wearing a bra, and what I love even more is being able to fill out the bra (artificially of course, using rice in tied-off pantyhose feet).

Let me start out by saying that I'm female and use female pronouns. For the past three or four years I've been a little gender confused. I still strongly identify when people say woman or female. But I also identify when people say men or male. And when I'm alone, thinking about myself, it gets more complicated than that.

2012-03-22 09:13:52,r85i2,4,8,"**I posted this is the wrong place yesterday, and so I've posted it here instead**

Hi there, the title is likely confusing and unclear. If that's the case, then it somewhat eludes to how I feel. For years I have felt this constant to-and-fro feeling towards being trans/not trans. And I've just been needing a little place where I can talk about how I feel without being judged. If you don't care for that then feel free to stop reading.

It all started when I was about 12 (now 19) when I started to get envious of girls over, well most things. From the fact that they got to dress a certain way, to the fact that their bodies looked a certain way compared to the way mine was starting to become etc (puberty's a bitch) but after about a year (at an all boy school) I kind of got comfortable with being a guy and was happy, playing in the football (soccer) team, Rugby team and water polo team as well as doing a little fencing at the school. I was ok with being a guy, but every so often would wonder what if I were a girl.

At 15 I started hanging around some girls from an all girl school close by and it started making me feel dysphoric again. I questioned a lot about myself, but obviously kept it all inside and internalised my jealousy and became self-hating.

It was at this time that I started truly writing music that I felt had any meaning and substance to it. I started to feel as though the fluidity and interplay of counter melodies I created symbolised how I felt about my gender, whilst the harsh, aggressive chugging riffs embodied my anger, which at first I was aimed at myself, but later became aimed at the world for making me think I couldn't express myself.

Fast forward to now and I suddenly go on reddit, I find people who talk about ""genderfluidity"" and the like, and get intrigued. I keep reading and I feel as though I identify with this idea of being somewhere inbetween Male and Female, being both and niether at the same time. I love being a guy at times, but at others I hate it... It's hard to verbalise how I actually feel, like there aren't the words in the English language to describe it (or that I just lack the eloquence to find the correct words). So I'm going to use a word coined by my younger brother - Omniflage, to mean when that all encompassing feeling when you feel odd or weird, like something is wrong but don't know why or when something isn't wrong.

The main issue I have is, how do I tell people, or express myself if I'm not even sure how I feel? Now for some the answer may be a simple ""just do what feels right"" but for me, with religious Jewish family (not my immediate family, but grandparents, uncles and aunts etc. who I see regularly) as well as my friends being wholly ignorant when it comes to this kind of thing, it's hard to do something without being scared or freaked out that something bad will happen.

I guess I don't really know why I wrote this, but I just needed somewhere where I could finally say exactly how I've been thinking and get my thoughts out there, so that I don't unnecessarily put a label on myself for someone else to understand my thoughts or so I don't try to fit myself into something I'm not. I'm still unsure as to who I am or how I feel myself, which may contribute to why I have yet to express this externally. I'm aware this is entirely incoherent and probably not worth any kind of read, but for me this has already helped in terms of being highly therapeutic.

2012-03-26 05:38:12,rdtdw,4,17,"I need someplace to talk about this, just to get it off my chest. A good friend of mine started talking to me about a year ago about her husband. She confessed to me that he was transgendered, and had just came out to her. She didn't know who else to really talk to about this but knew I was all down with the LGBT thing so thought I was the safest one to talk to about it all. I gave her advice, listened to her, and let her know if she ever needed to talk I was here for her. 

What I didn't tell her at first was that I spent most of my early life looking into gender studies and always felt myself as being trans(f2m) I remember reading an article about a woman who got a sex change to male in her 40s - after she was married with children. It struck such a cord with me when I was a kid. I even went so far as to do a lot of research and think about reconsigment surgery. It wasn't until I was talking to a trans friend of mine about it, and I voiced my worries - I'm only 4'9"" and have a hard enough life as female, that I wasn't sure if I could be male and at this height. She suggested I try living as a female - something I was born as but have never really LIVED as. Even as a small child I always passed as a boy, I kept my hair short, my friends were boys, and in high school I even adapted a boy's name as a nickname. So I did.. I lived life as a female from age 19 onward. Fast foward to now - I'm married, with 2 kids. My husband knows of my past and my feelings - he's been with me since I was a teen - but admits he loves the female side of me. 

And with my friend talking to me about her husband, a lot of long lost buried thoughts and feelings are coming back.

I'm not really feeling anymore like I am just male, or just female, but like I'm a wonderful mix of the two.

and I guess I don't know, that for the first time in 10 years a lot of forgotten feelings are coming up and I don't know how to deal with them. I finally came out and told my friend I was trans, and so that's why I know so much, but I feel now like that was a lie, like I thought I WAS trans all those years ago but now? I'm not so sure.

I am comfortable with my body, to a point. I have had bulimia since I was 12 because I don't feel I look like a ""proper woman"" for some reason. I would not want my body to be male, at any rate.



However, I get frustrated a lot. 



I feel like most of the world consists of those little pink pins and blue pins from the Game of Life and neither set wants to let me hang out with them because I'm a yellow pin. If I spend time with guys, I get along with them, but there's this barrier still; I can't go along to ""guy nights"" because I have breasts and no penis. I don't fit in with the pink pins, either, because women always seem to find me odd and stand-offish no matter how hard I try, and I can't engage with them the same way I can talk to men.



I don't want to change my appearance or identity in any way, I want to be my identity, but I feel it's smothered by all these ideas about what I should look like, how a girl should act, etc. My parents always question me about my social life and get worried if I say I don't really go out, whereas my brother doesn't get interrogated in the same way because it seems OK for guys to be more introverted.


If I dress in plain clothes and don't wear make-up, I get accused of being a lesbian by people I don't even know. Girls comment on my appearance, everything seems so tied in how I look that it makes me rage. If I show up for meetings with my mentor and haven't bothered to do my make-up, she always asks if I'm feeling OK. I get prickly about things, like my boss telling me to tie my hair up better when I have no idea how to make it look nice because I wasn't interested in that stuff as a kid.


I want to have no body at all and just float through life without people basing their analysis on the way I look. I feel so uncomfortable in my own skin purely because of the way people see me. I hate identifying as male or female, being called ""she"", even having a feminine sounding name (it's a flower name).
