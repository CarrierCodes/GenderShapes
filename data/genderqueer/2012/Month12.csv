2012-12-03 05:39:26,146qxl,11,9,"I've been thinking a lot about getting a nickname, and switching to they/them pronouns. I think going by ""she"" keeps me more closeted and makes it more likely for my friends to reference me being a girl. And, it's sort of weird that my friends who I am out to will still use ""she"" based just on my sex. I don't see a she when I look in the mirror, why should I give my friends more of a reason to?

My name is Sam. Short for Samantha. I have a weird history with my name. For a while in high school and early college I wanted to go by Samantha because to me it flowed better and went better with my last name. But before realizing I'm genderqueer I already was going by Sam (my work name tag even says Sam instead of Samantha, thankfully). Now that I realize this, and I'm slowly coming out to my friends, I've been thinking about the possibility of going by a different one. For one thing, when I go by Sam, people still assume the right to call me Samantha. Also, most Sams I know are girls so it's more often associated with Samantha anyways. 

A reason this jumped in my head lately is because the name ""Caleb"" appeared. I hadn't even really been thinking about changing my name, just pronouns at that point. Right away I thought about me going by it and it felt amazing for some reason. Now, this isn't a unisex name, it's considered a male name. I'm not the least bit binary identified, I don't even consider myself trans-masculine or in-between male and female. I'm just not a woman. My gender has no relation or connection to binary genders at all. So, that's in a way a drawback. But it also sort of fits because it challenges gendered names and also separates me more from being a woman than I otherwise would be. But it doesn't sound really masculine either, so it's nice. And I really like it. Another drawback is that I don't know how it sounds with my last name (alliteration, lol). But on the other hand it'll be a few years before I use it more officially because I'm not ready to be completely out. Another name I thought of was Morgan, because I always really liked the name, especially for guys. Most people I've talked to though, think it's more a girl's name. Which isn't a great fix for people thinking my name is feminine, but it also is a bit better because it would be safer for me to use as it's unisex. Another unisex name I like is Skylar, and it at least starts with my first initial. 

What do you guys think? 

*edit*: I feel like at this point the only thing keeping me from going with Caleb is how it fits with my last name. I mentioned these names to a friend and we both voted off Morgan.

2012-12-15 01:03:13,14vf9w,2,26,"“Boys Don’t Cry”, by the Cure-  that was one of the first hints. Identifying with it so fully.  I had known the feeling far longer than the word for it.  I remember my “boy days”-  days when I looked down and was revolted at  what I saw.  Days when I put on the bra that made me look the flattest, a loose shirt and hand-me-downs from my male friends.  Days when I felt confused, depressed, and winced at words like “she” and “girl”.  But, I remember laying in bed in my singular pair of boxers, made from an old pair of plaid pajama bottoms that I had hemmed, listening to that song.  Smiling, as I started to dry my tears, then standing up to dance, as I knew that if I were to be a proper boy, the tears would have to stop.  Sometimes, forcibly choking them down without a smile to replace them, since the tears seemed to illegitimize my feelings.
	I started telling my friends, “I’m not really a girl”, when my differences were pointed out in conversation.  They smiled and nodded, not really knowing what it meant.  I don’t think I did either. 
There’s a venue in a not-so-safe part of town that my friends and I frequent.  Once, my friends were jumped by a group of gang-bangers outside of a Queers show.  It was an 11-on-3 fight that they only escaped with the help of a bystander and a bouncer.  I was inside, nursing a hurt leg-  the mosh pit had not been kind to my bad knee, and I had to pop it back into place.  I didn’t know what had happened until I saw S.’s girlfriend, Co.,  with tears streaming down her face.  C., with a bit of blood on his cheek, told me that we had to leave, immediately.  We snuck back to his car and sped out of that neighborhood.  Everyone was frightened, but no one but Co. cried.  While driving home, and towards the hospital, they told what had happened.  The gang bangers had been harassing Co., and the boys called them out on it.  They kept going outside to see if they were lingering.  Their tough act did them no favors, though.  Fighting did no good, and it seemed that they had only barely gotten away.  
	As we approach our own neighborhood, S. looked at me, and asked if I needed to go home through the bloody paper towel that was stuck to his split lip.  He knew that my knee was hurt, and I needed some painkillers and rest.  I told him that he needed the hospital more, and that my knee could wait a few hours.  He insisted that he would be fine, and I was driven home first.  
	After that incident, C. became determined to learn how to fight.  He wanted to take boxing, taekwondo, and get stronger.  He asked me if I could sew thin metal sheets to the inside of his leather jacket, for armor.  He needed to prove himself like a child who had fallen off of their first bike.  He had to prove that he was a man, not a failure.  
	S., on the other hand, was not on board for all of this.  I saw my friend, who used to hand me all of his valuables and run towards a fight with a lighter in his fist, shrink away from confrontation for the first time in my memory.  He said that he knew he had been wrong before- being able to punch someone says nothing about your real strength, and no petty argument was worth paying for with your health or life. Three weeks later, he and his girlfriend went back to the venue, with no problems.  
	Months ago, I sat in the passenger’s seat of S.’s car, upset, but having a hard time choking the words out.  My friend had died a few days earlier, and I was taking it hard.  I had tried to see S. before that night, but he had been busy.   As I told him, he drove silently, dragging on a cigarette and looking straight ahead.  He asked me why I had waited to tell him if it had been bothering me for so long.  I brushed it off, joking that he had had better things to do, while a lump in my throat rose up to become water in my eyes. He said “Some things are more important;  there’s always time for friends.”  I told him about the guilt I felt over it, the distress, the disbelief that I could let this feeling envelope me so fully.  He responded his “What’s wrong with caring?  What’s wrong with feeling bad?”  I told him that I couldn’t see anything wrong with either of those, that I always tried to feel whatever I was going to feel and deal with it from there.   
S. told me about the last time he had cried since childhood.  It was a couple years ago, and he probably wouldn’t like me to tell you the circumstances behind it.  That aside,  he said that everyone mourns in different ways, and no way is the wrong way.  That it was okay to be sad about something, and it was okay to cry. 

A few nights ago, I was driving around with N., who is somewhere in between being my friend and my lover.  A lot of my life takes place in the passenger seat of other people’s cars. Earlier that day, I had sent him an article on masculinity, and how men are pressured to disguise their emotions. 
 I should preface this by saying that Nate has lots of feelings. On average, I deal with a crying N. twice a week. Once, as we lay in bed next to each other, just talking, a switch flipped, and out came the tears.  That particular night, he started disparaging himself, saying “Look at me.  Fuckin’ cry baby.” I smiled, and wiped his cheek.  “Well, that’s all bullshit, anyways.  Gender roles, right?”, he said, laughing through tears.  
While discussing the article, he told me that he didn’t feel manly when he cried, and that he always expects me to be annoyed with him because of it.  To find him unattractive or weak.  I told him that I didn’t mind. It didn’t affect me like that, no really, it didn’t.  He said that being manly, in his mind, was being in control of your emotions, and being responsible- a leader.  It seems to me that he just described an adult, not a man, specifically.  After a few minutes of riding along,  a song came up on the mixed CD I had made him almost half a year ago.  It was “Boys Don’t Cry”;  I turned it up, and silently chuckled at the coincidence.  
	Today, S. and I sat outside on the back staircase that leads to the apartments above the studio we work at.  We smoked our cigarettes, making a game out of writing on each other’s pants with the ashes.  We tried to make plans for what to do tonight.  He joked,  “I feel like staying in, drinking a bottle of wine, and crying all night.  I haven’t had a good night like that in a while.”  We laughed, and I said “I don’t think I’ve ever seen you cry.”  He told me, once again, that he hadn’t in a very long time.  But, this time he added, “I don’t really feel the need to weep.  It doesn’t change anything or make me feel any better.”  I paused for a minute, “I suppose it’s okay not to cry if you never feel like it.  The problem is when you want to cry and you can’t.”  After a minute, we carried on our conversation, then strolled back inside to work. 
	Towards the end of November, I finally told my friends the word to describe people like me- genderqueer.  They listened and tried to understand.  S. called me “a perfect gentleman” earlier on when I refused to tell the details of a past fling I had had with a girl we both knew.  They try to understand, but I’m not sure they really do.  I’m not sure I really do.  
	The truth is, the world taught me what sort of girl it thought I should be.  Experience taught me what sort of girl I am. I’ll probably never tell them this, but I wonder if my friends know that they’re the ones who taught me how to be a man.

Over the past week, there's been some discussion of adding a new flag to our flair: A Queer Anarchist flag.

Right now, we've got an empty flair space that has to be there for people who do not want a flag. It's an option that has to be there for the ""no flag, just text"" CSS to work properly.

When I add a single flag, it messes up the formatting and balance of the other flags, so I try to add them in pairs. If I add this Anarchist flair, I'd have to add something else as a placeholder.

&gt;&lt;3 you are such a lover. Why can't you just be a boy so I could fly out there and marry you tomorrow?

I ask her why.

&gt;Because you'd make the best most caring and intelligent boyfriend ever. You pretty much have it all.

It was so incredibly flattering. Lately I've come to accept that, not only was I a tomboy growing up but I'm not an ally for the LGBT movement - I'm part of it. This was conflicting for me. Prior to a couple months ago, I would have never considered myself part of the community.


When I joined reddit, I watched a bunch of subs, and a bunch for LGBT and other queer issues, wanting to educate myself so I would never have to inadvertently stick my foot in my mouth and upset someone else. I only knew trans* individuals from a chat I belonged to online, so I figured hey, I want to know more, so I especially digged into trans* issues. Found a ftm (though not very friendly) chat, and wanted to learn more. The chat didn't last long for me, and I didn't find it helpful.


All while this was happening, I decided that I wanted to lose weight (as of this past August).  I have been told that I am a very attractive woman, and although on the chubby (for some) or just plain fat (for others), I decided – even if I was happy with my body, I would lose weight to be healthier.


As it went on, my partner didn't pay much attention to my progress and honestly didn't seem to care. It, along with our deadbedroom situation, it just felt like he had no interest for my body anymore, so between trying to lose weight, it being a frustratingly slow process, and finding myself ugly, I really began to hate my body. Before all of this, I accepted that I was a woman. I never questioned myself or thought of myself as genderqueer. It never was on my mind – even if I've been quite the tomboy as a kid and even as an adult.


Of the past few days, I've accepted that this body isn't “mine.” I don't feel like I am connected, and I even feel a disconnect from who I was two years ago, it's a lot to swallow. My mind doesn't feel 100% femme and I realized that some (not all) of my unhappiness comes with me feeling awkward in my body. I'm at an age where I'm supposed to dress quite feminine (especially as a professional) and I really just want to say “fuck you” to the system.


As I slowly lose more weight I think I will be happier with my body. I am hoping to feel at one with myself again, and accept myself again – I have absolutely no desire to transition, and honestly, I find dicks pretty damn ugly and I would hate to get bottom or top surgery. I'm at a body type where I would NEVER look good as a man, but I do look nice dressed somewhat masculine (I have described it to others as quite preppy or athletic). And definitely exciting, I will only look better as I lose more weight.


So those texts were absolutely amazing to read. I've thought about male names I would want if I were born male, and how I would live my life if I was a taller, with the successful life that I am striving to achieve now. Though I know I can never be someone's boyfriend, it was extremely flattering and just rubbed me all the right ways. I have not come out to anyone. I mentioned it to my partner before he left for basic military training but he has no idea to the extent that I feel. I am afraid that he will not accept me and will not want to be with me. But then another part of me finds that silly, as I'm not changing, I'm merely putting a label to how I've been my entire life.


I hope everyone's had a wonderful Christmas, or other holidays if Christmas isn't your thing (mine personally was terrible and I'm emotionally drained from family drama and bullshit).
