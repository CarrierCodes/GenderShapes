2012-09-01 18:45:06,z70el,3,6,"Hi /r/genderqueer,

I don't want to step on any toes. I know some of you are very confident in your gender identities, and have been for a very long time. Understand that I find androgyny very confusing.

So I'm going to make this brief.

When I was younger, I questioned my gender identity, but decided that it would be too hard to convince people I was something *else*. I've posted about this before on here. Here's a few other snippets:

When a friend in aromatherapy offered to design something for me, I asked for an androgynous scent. Something that could be either one. I remember describing it as an ambiguous sort of lift-anyone-in-the-room's-spirits. Also, citrus.

I have [a commented lookbook](http://imgur.com/a/vrkyb). I tend to point out the ambiguous properties as ones I want to have for myself. However, sometimes I worry that I'm just trying to be *appealing to everyone*, not true to myself - some sort of repressed self-esteem issue.

TMI alert: Although I identify as grey-asexual, the majority of my imagined/desired experiences include a sexually intersex/hermaphroditic individual; often with me as said individual.

Judging from the above moments, does it seem like androgyny is a part of me, or simply something I like?

2012-09-10 22:55:59,zoefs,3,9,"Hii everyone,

Sorry for the rambling nature of this post. I get really nervous when I post online about this sort of thing. 

I really need help with identifying myself. First off, I am a 24 year old male.

I would say when I was about 14 years old I began to fantasize about being turned into a woman. I researched and was under the belief I was a transsexual for years and years. However, throughout those years I would have phases where I never even thought about being female.  I planned all throughout my lower years of university to transition to a female. 

I met my SO 3 years ago. She is wonderful and dating her pretty much made my desire to be female disappear. She doesn't know about any of this nor do I plan on telling her. 

I get in these moods where all I can think about is being female. Then I get into moods where I don't think about being female for weeks.  I try to battle that by playing games online exclusively as female and posting on sports and gaming forums as female. It helps... sometimes. 

Anyway, I stumbled upon this subreddit and found out about dualgender, bigender, fluidgender. Can anyone highlight what you believe I described?  It really has opened up my life since I discovered this stuff a few weeks ago. Because I always thought I was just pushing the feminine desires away because it would be too hard or difficult. 

But if I can learn how to embrace both genders than I believe I could live a lot happier life.

Thanks for reading.

2012-09-12 08:23:57,zr9yb,4,15,"im not really sure where to begin or end. im hoping for some dialogue i guess. i feel like theres no place for me. even in a place like this. the problem is its not really my identity thats the issue. the issue is that what im drawn to romantically is practically voided by its own default setting. 

ill describe myself first. white. biologically male. early thirties. most people register me as straight, but definitely not all. i exhibit tendencies i guess. i gravitate toward the envelope pushers in society. heavily tattooed people. subcultures of all kinds. anyone fighting for something. i tend to seek out gay males for friendships like a kid catching pokemon. i dont sleep with men but i sometimes find them attractive. 

the problem is that im only attracted to very-gay-leaning, gender-bending biological females. dont write me off just yet. *i see you reaching to click back.* this isnt a fetish. this is why im taking the time to reach out here. i have fantasies about other things. i dont type ""genderqueer"" into porn search engines. theres a difference between what gets me hard and what makes my stomach ache and my ears get hot. 

its been this way forever. i remember being a kid in the late eighties and this movie came on tv called ""Just One of the Guys"". its about a girl who dresses as a boy through highschool so she can enroll in a journalism program. i remember being fascinated with her. i hated the end of the movie **spoiler alert** when she went back to being ""girly"". i couldnt understand how anyone could think the dainty submissive soft-featured girl was somehow more appealing than the cocky square-jawed fearless rebel. 

anyway. i find most ""typical"" girl behavior extremely aggravating to be around. i cant stand the damsel in distress routine. i find perfume, makeup, and lingerie well... gross. i guess gross is the actual word. 

and then i see a skinny butch female. cocky. confident. wearing levis and a tie. swagger everywhere. ready to fight the world. and my heart dies a little because i think that fearlessness is for someone else. shes never going to fight the tide of society to stand bravely holding my hand. in fact she probably thinks my beard is disgusting.

2012-09-21 03:04:59,108alt,20,18,"Hi,

I have a question concerning gender identity.

I have read in several places, when discussing trans* issues, that gender identity is a distinct thing from one’s gender role. That everybody has a gender identity that tells them what they are intuitively. They strongly feel like a man or like a woman. I don’t doubt that, and I know that this is very important to many people, but I’m confused about it.

I just can’t find that in myself. To me, gender identity has always been about the gender roles imposed by society. I can tell that, for example, I do not conform all too well to how men are traditionally “supposed” to be. So I certainly have an opinion on being a man based on that. But as I understand it, for most people, that is not all. They know that, for example, they are a man, even if they don’t agree with the traditional male gender role, and it is important to them. How does that work? Do you feel anything like that?

Saying “I am a man” feels weird to me. “I am a woman” feels even weirder, but that may just be because I’m physically male and was raised as a male. No matter how much I think about it or try to listen to my feelings, I just cannot find any intuitive feeling for it. I don’t know what “feeling like a man” or “feeling like a woman” really means beyond agreeing or disagreeing with the stereotypes associated with the genders. I feel no body dysphoria, but if I understand correctly that’s not really the criterion, either. Can you explain to me how, apart from external social attitudes, one can feel like a specific gender?

2012-09-21 19:26:54,109h6x,23,11,"So, I was engaged recently in a discussion with the head of our LGBTQ resource center about how my experience in conference settings has been that people only use ""genderqueer"" as a lowest-common-denominator descriptor, the one that most people ""get"", if only that they understand it exists, when really, they have a much more specific word they would use for themselves if the person seemed like they'd understand the difference.

For instance, I'm a transsexual female, but I think of myself as androgyne femme.

This has only been my experience, but those I encounter who use ""genderqueer"" as a primary descriptor have tended to be doing so politically, i.e. they use it to express their intentionality behind queering society's gender norms (often in a feminist context), not necessarily as a gender identity unto itself. Those who assert an identity have tended to have a more specific term they prefer when giving a name to their gender identity. 

Those I meet who use genderqueer as their primary identity have tended to be CAFAB. CAMAB (specifically non-transsexual) people who ""fit"" the common understanding of genderqueer have been quick to label themselves in other ways: sissy, faerie, male femme, prettyboy, and some even have taken on metrosexual as a sepcific gender identity.

2012-09-30 13:05:09,10pj29,6,4,"Hello everyone, my name is Irving, I'm a 23 year old ""male"" and I mostly created this topic to introduce myself to /r/genderqueer and to ask a couple questions. So I've known about gender queer for quite some time, and from the moment I heard about the term, I personally identified with it. The main reason I consider myself gender queer is that physically I am most attracted to, and prefer to present myself in a somewhat androgynous matter (though I still consider myself mostly gay). I also have a huge mix of interests and personality traits that I personally don't consider gender specific in any way. A few other tid bits about myself; I am very close to nature and animals. If I was able to describe my spirituality, it would have something to do with the fact that I feel all living creatures are connected in a magical sort of way. I'm also a HUGE nerd (I also frequent /r/gaymers). Anyways, that's just a little bit about myself. Now onto my questions...

My first question is in regards to the gender queer term itself. I am someone who personally prefers to avoid labels, at least in regards to personal identity, so I was wondering if anyone agrees. Would you consider gender queer a ""label-less lable"" of sorts (yes I know, that is a complete oxymoron)? I ask, because the way I feel gender queer applies to me is that, the way that I am is that I don't restrict the way I dress or act based on the fact that I am biologically a male. Basically I try to just be myself as much as is possible. And while I personally don't need the gender queer identifier to help understand who I am, I do like it simply because it allows me to find others who I can relate to (such as finding this board). So I guess you can say that I do, and I don't identify as gender queer. Does that make sense to anyone? Does anyone else feel this way?

My other question is this; how does someone reconcile with the fact that in many professional settings, dressing and acting in a very androgynous manner is something that isn't really accepted in any way. I really only have two choices at this point in my life. Live a double life, in which I take myself out of my comfort zone and behave more stereotypically male while at work (and thus feel like I'm lying to myself all day), or quit my job and be unemployed (not really an option at all &gt;.&gt;).

So I\'ve known about gender queer for quite some time, and from the moment I heard about the term, I personally identified with it. The main reason I consider myself gender queer is that physically I am most attracted to, and prefer to present myself in a somewhat androgynous matter (though I still consider myself mostly gay). I also have a huge mix of interests and personality traits that I personally don\'t consider gender specific in any way. A few other tid bits about myself; I am very close to nature and animals. If I was able to describe my spirituality, it would have something to do with the fact that I feel all living creatures are connected in a magical sort of way. I\'m also a HUGE nerd (I also frequent /r/gaymers). Anyways, that\'s just a little bit about myself. Now onto my questions...\n\nMy first question is in regards to the gender queer term itself. I am someone who personally prefers to avoid labels, at least in regards to personal identity, so I was wondering if anyone agrees. Would you consider gender queer a ""label-less lable"" of sorts (yes I know, that is a complete oxymoron)?
