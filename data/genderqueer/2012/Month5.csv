I'm a twenty-year old bi-(or pan-)sexual born-female. And, for most of my life I've been fine with that. I am a bit of a ""tomboy"" though. [I'm not overly girly, like shopping for dresses and shoes, I don't like going out with my ""girlfriends"" on every other date, I don;t put makeup on, etc. But I've.. also always wondered what it's like to be a male, and something more than just curiosity.  [Like if a fairy came up to me and offered me any wish except for the cliched ones of love peace, stoping starvation, etc. I'd seriously consider wishes to become a boy]

I mean, I can imagine fingering and licking, and vagina against vagina. I can imagine using a strap-on (or even being a male and using my penis) into another female, I can imagine being a male and having anal intercourse (either me or the other man entering), and I can imagine having anal intercourse as a female with another male/female-with strapon... but
just having somebody put something into my vagina doesn't feel right to my imagination.
I don't know if it's because I'm inexperienced, or if it's because as a child I was felt up down there by people five years older than me against my will, or something else entirely.

And, I don't want to go through with a sex-change because I feel comfortable in my own body. I like my boobs, I like my hips, I like appearing and dressing, and acting like a female. I like my body, but it's just the vagina that feels weird.

2012-05-18 03:31:11,tsr8f,14,14,"Hey all, mind if I vent about something that's been bugging me for the past week?

I'm a genderqueer person who was assigned female at birth.  About a week ago I had my second visit to Planned Parenthood to renew my birth control prescription.  We'll come to that later.  

The first visit happened a few months ago, and it was great!  It was my first time pursuing hormonal birth control.  While I was raised with abstinence-only education, I did my part to research safer sex so I mostly knew what everything was all about.  Still, the doctor needed to ask me plenty of questions, and I had to give lots of answers.  Some of those were about my sex life, my gender, the medications I'm already on...everything went smoothly.  The doctor who had me was curious about my genderqueer identity, so we ended up having a long discussion on what exactly that meant for me and how I came to recognize and embrace my gender identity.  It was great!  They were eager to learn, and I was eager to share.  They thanked me for broadening their horizons, and I left that appointment feeling great with my first ever BC pill prescription in hand.

Fast forward three months.  Since I'm on so many medications, I was only allowed a few months prescription of BC rather than a full year to make sure that nothing went wrong.  I had a different doctor this time, but all I needed was a prescription refill so I expected everything to go as easily as it had the first time.  

That didn't happen.

After waiting for my name to be called, I was taken into an office where I was immediately questioned about my past.  The doctor noticed that I was on antidepressants, anxiolytics, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, the works.  They brought up my psychiatric history as well as my most recent hospitilizations.  I wasn't expecting to talk about my history of suicidal ideation when I just wanted to get BC pills!  I felt vulnerable and uncomfortable; the topic seemed absolutely inappropriate for what I was there for.

Finally, they brought up the notes that the previous doctor had left on my gender identity.  They thought that it was strange that I identified as genderqueer, and asked if I was sexually confused.  There is a lot of chaos and uncertainty in my life, but that is not one of those things.  If there's anything I'm proud and certain of about myself, it's my sexual orientation and gender identity.  I tried telling them as such, but they kept pressing me, explicitly suggesting that my depression, anxiety, and suicidal feelings were due to gender confusion.  

It hurt so much to be told that my problems were due to being genderqueer.  I'm plenty aware that I'm mentally ill, but to have that attributed to my gender identity was humiliating and insulting.  *Anyone* can struggle with mental illness.  I'm not messed up just because my gender identity falls outside the male/female binary!  I was expecting better, especially from a place like Planned Parenthood.  I don't always expect to be understood, but I do expect to be respected.  I don't think that's too much to ask.

I don't know what I'm looking for in posting this.  Sympathy? Commiseration? Insight from other genderqueer people who also happen to struggle with mental illness?  All I know is that it feels good to tell my story.  Thanks for listening.

I am a lesbian, I know that for sure, but gender is a different story. It's like some days I feel like I'm comfortable being a girl. I'll wear pretty dresses to parties, put on make up, talk girl talk, but other times I feel like I'm less of a girl. I cut almost all my hair off so I have a very boyish cut, and I feel like this hair cut is so much closer to the real me than the long wavy hair I've had for so long. But its not just the hair, I've done a bit of experimenting dressing in guy clothes, and sometimes it feels like that is how I should be dressing. So to make this simpler to explain, I'm going to use cake as a metaphor(cause let's face it, who doesn't like cake?). I feel as if I'm a cake made mostly of 'girl' batter, as it were, with a considerable bit of 'boy' batter thrown into the mix. I don't feel as if I'm either gender. That brings me to the question; what would I 'identify' as? Simply gender queer? Not that I really need to label myself, but I want to know /what/ I am exactly.

After a really supportive friend said ""then do it?"" following me expressing that I wished that I could wear sundresses like her, I finally worked up the nerve to buy one at Wal-Mart. Picking it up and walking through the store was terrifying until I saw myself in it and felt-- pretty. 

Today and last night were the first instances of me wearing a dress in public. I feel sort of raw and emotional. I'm not entirely sure why. I've always wanted to do this, and I've always hated having to dress like a male and behave like one, but I still feel rather emotional.

Does anyone know what this is? Is this a common experience?
