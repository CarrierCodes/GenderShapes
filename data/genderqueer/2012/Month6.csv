2012-06-08 13:53:57,urk50,3,15,"Everyone seems to have differing definitions of the whole gender thing, so the definitions I'll be using in my post are as follows:

Gender identity -- sense of whether one is bigender, agender, girl, man, genderfluid, etc

Subconscious sex -- set of expectations and sense of your sexed body

----

I was born transsexual female, I was assigned male at birth. My subconsious sex is female.

After coming to terms with my subconscious sex, I initially thought that it must mean I was a trans girl/woman/ifeeltoooldforgirl/tooyoungforwoman/.

This sort of made sense at the time -- back then I was viewing subconscious sex as analagous to gender identity.

The gender binary means that the easiest way for me to be recognised as female would be to say I was a girl/woman. Within a society which religiously and violently holds onto the gender binary, feminine pronouns are associated with the female sex.

Being recognised as female is very important to me, I cannot relate in any way to a male body.

I like being addressed with feminine pronouns but I think I may just be misinterpreting my pleasure towards being recognised as female as pleasure towards being recognised as a girl/woman. Society and it's gender binary complicate things.

But I'm not so sure about this whole gender and gender identity thing.

Now I have the terminology and a context with which to place my subconscious sex in, a context separate and distinct from gender identity, I'm suddenly hit with utter confusion as to what gender is. Is this thought process even right, are subconscious sex and gender identity distinct?

Is gender just a set of culturally constructed stereotypes and assumptions based upon one's sex? Fuck that. That's not a concept I can associate with.

Is gender a method of communication, much like wearing a t-shirt displaying a logo of a Linux distro is? Is it analagous to a t-shirt broadcasting the message that -- ""Hey, I'm part of this group, 'Linux user'"". ""Hey, I'm part of this group, 'girl'"". I don't know, fuck. There isn't any sort of homogeneity within the gender groups, unlike the concept of 'Linux user'. 

Is gender an umbrella term, consisting of societal steroeotypes, subconscious sex and other things I'm not aware of?

To me, if I think of gender as not being defined to encompass cultural stereotypes and/or subconsious sex then I draw a complete blank as to what's left behind within the label of ""gender"" -- it becomes meaningless to me.

If gender is defined to comprise of stereotypes and/or subconscious sex, I'd be quite correct in my thinking that the concept of gender without those becomes nothing. People's usage of, and identification with, gendered terms seems to suggest otherwise. Why do so many people identify within the binary? Why do so many people refer to gender with their transsexual status -- trans woman, trans man, etc -- why, if gender means [stereotypes + subconsious sex], are so many people happy with attributing themselves to the stereotyped part? Why do they not just say ""I am a transsexual female""?

Is gender something more? Am I just agender or androgyene and my gender is sort of, kind of, defined by the lack of one, or at least some sort of extreme apathy -- is this almost blinding me to other's views on genders like man, woman, bigender, etc? I don't know, I've only properly versed myself with the experiences of binary identified transsexual people so my knowledge is most certainly lacking in these areas.

If gender identity doesn't include, and is separate from, subconscious sex, what is gender identity? What does that mean for gender? I just don't understand the concept of gender anymore. I wish I could just be seen as a female person, rather than messing with this girl/woman buisness but it seems I don't have much choice within this binary society (aside from of course, educating the few close to me).

Am I just a trans woman who's overthinking everything and tying herself in knots?

The only other person I've brought any of this up with at all is my half sister who I barely even know because she's lived in Washington my entire life, and a stranger I found from one of my friends on facebook who works for the Gender Identity center of facebook.

Basically I've been having tons and tons of mixed feelings about who I really am. When I was very young, like in second grade I've felt like I would be more me in a girl's body. I remember specifically praying to God one night as hard as I could, to put me in an alternate universe but as a girl even though my family weren't religiously involved in almost anyway. After that I started to second guess my self and tricked myself into thinking my life wasn't so bad as a male.

I've spent long long nights thinking about it specifically and now I just really don't know what I actually want. On one hand I find everything to do with being female interesting and feeling as if that's what I want, and I even just ask to go by my chosen female name and use a feminine voice when talking to other people online, though I have never shown them my face, and I make up a different past to explain my own side of things like some sort of compulsive liar, though I just really don't want to be a guy. I'm not trying to get ANYTHING from them besides them believing I am really a cisgendered woman.

And then on the other I hand I pulled myself out of depression from ""not being"" a female and was completely fine with being a male.

But I still can't help but thinking, like, I would be me if I wasn't ""QuestionablyGqThrow"".

It's all very confusing to me and I feel like there's two me's. One that's female and one that's male.

The only thing I am absolutely certain about my sexuality and gender identity though is that I'm pansexual

2012-06-11 06:40:43,uvt00,10,12,"Hello all. I have a question and I apologize if this seems lame and/or if something I say may seem offensive. I swear it would be due to unintentional ignorance.

 Many of my friends say I am gender-queer and some say gender-fluid. What is the difference? Secondly my sex is male, born that way. I tend to be very masculine most of the time but I have frequent times my life almost weekly where I feel like I am a woman and just am very feminine with my behavior, dress, feeling the need to shave more of my body than normal, etc. I don't cross-dress but that is due to money and not being able to afford a new wardrobe.

 For many years I thought I should have been a woman and considered getting surgery but I now know this is not the case and would have been a mistake. None of this bothers me but I see terms like gender-queer, gender-fluid, and many others and I am trying to understand which would apply to me?

 As for sexual orientation, I identify as pansexual and some pansexuals say I am ""gender-blind"" but I was under the impression that had to do with the gender/s I am attracted to which then that would be accurate.

 Now please don't say I don't need a label to be who I am. I inherently know this and believe it. However no matter how much I may think that way, labels (restricting though they may be) are useful and in this case, I am trying to find out how I relate.

2012-06-19 06:57:30,v9ljz,32,32,"As the title implies, this is my story. Well, a part of it, at least. I'm insomniatic, but not so insomniatic that I'm going to drop a book on the reddits tonight. As said, I was raised in the LGBT community. Needless to say, this has shaped every ounce of my being into a more open-minded person in all directions.

My friends have always joked about how they expected me to be gay. Except replace friends with fucking everyone and replace joke with constant verbal and physical harassment throughout the entity of my childhood. You see, I was a faggot by proxy. It was always ""Is he going to be gay or not gay?"" It was never about ""Who is he going to grow up to be?"" It made me sick, but that's a LONG rant for another day.

Being forced into that box had me CONSTANTLY doubting my sexuality. Gods forbid I prove any of those abusive bastards right and be attracted to a boy, OH NO NEVER. I have finally come to terms with my attraction to -some- men, but it's mostly the guys that sit in the middle (think VERY andro/center). If I actually appreciated my own dick, I'd probably hop on one, but I have a hard enough time not being bored to death or reviled by my own parts. Again, a story for another day, but HEY I'M TRYING TO BUILD A FRAMEWORK HERE, BE PATIENT, okay?

*cough* So, over the years, I've always thought about the ebbs and flows of sexuality. My dead-set attraction to lesbians and tom-boys, I came to find out, wasn't because I was ""jealous"" or ""wanted what I couldn't have"" or ""programmed"" by my parents. I've genuinely been attracted to lesbians, like, full throttle ""OMG I WANT TO GET TO KNOW HER AND SNUGGLE"" kind of attraction. For years I've fought with that until a kind, queer-minded individual told me ""No, seriously. It's okay. You're a lesbian with a penis.""

It blew my mind. Homosexuality is A sexual orientation in a myriad. I might be physically a male, but I am homo-emotionally female. I'm also physically nothing near masculine. I've always been slim and slender and never put on muscle (nor did I EVER want to,) and this did nothing but fuel the ""FAGGOT!"" fires I had to deal with as a kid.

Then, I learn about what it is to be genderqueer. The term seemed to fit so well. I sat on it for a loooooong time and finally decided to come out to my friends. Bi never felt right because I dislike men so much I hate myself sometimes for it. I'm definitely not gay, but I'm not straight, either. I've always felt somewhere in the middle. ""Queer but not gay is."" how I used to say it (especially every time a boy wanted in my pants). Genderqueer not only SOUNDS better, but it feels RIGHT. 

The few that understood more or less reacted: ""Duh."" The few that didn't asked me to enlighten them. Some of my friends (gay/bi/straight) decided that I was just looking for attention and ""The whole genderqueer thing is just a fad."" I was crushed, but the label was good enough for me, it encompassed everything I had been FEELING but unable to put a name to for YEARS.

My mom, however, looked at me like I was speaking a different language.

""So, you want to be a tranny?""

No, mom, I don't. See, mom identifies as bi. She was with a woman for the first 23ish years of my life. I've only known her as a lesbian. When I was a kid, we went to pride fest every year. Eventually, tho, their participation in the LGBT community stopped. So, apart from having almost zero support for being ""gay by proxy"" and all of the discrimination that brought, my mom is also VERY behind the times on the minutia of sexuality and gender identity. I tried to explain to her more or less everything I've described above, and more. The conversation ended with her saying ""Well, I just don't understand."", yawning and then she went to bed.

We haven't talked about it since.

See, I was expecting... something. Maybe that's why it hurt. I didn't expect anger... what kind of hypocritical monster would she be. But I got nothing. No support. No concern, just complete disinterest.

So, why is this a problem? Why am I bothering to pour my heart out to a small sub-sub-reddit?

Well, I am deeply considering hormone therapy to bring myself closer to the middle of the gender spectrum. The term ""tranny"", when I think of it being applied to myself makes my stomach turn. I'm not wanting to change from one gender to another, I'm trying to find ME. Since mom seems to see things so black and white, I feel like it's going to be a hard sell and I might not get the love and support I was expecting. It's one thing to tell your mom you're gender non-conformist, it's another thing entirely to have to explain starting HRT without the intent of going ""tranny"".

My biggest fear is having to come out AGAIN. To everyone. Especially my partner who is biologically female, also genderqueer, recently came out as homo-emotional and said she LOVED me because she sees me as ME. I am pretty sure she would stick through HRT with me, but everything else is... scary. I've always been afraid to identify as a lesbian because I was afraid that the ""real"" lesbian community wouldn't take me seriously. I've felt for a long time like I'm just crazy, or have no place in the world, but it seems I might not be as alone or batshit as I thought I was.

Honestly, I don't know what I was trying to accomplish with this post. Call it an introduction, a lament and an open-hearted rant. I think I might actually be soon loosened from the cold grips of insomnia.

I have been, mostly, the picture of hetero male for most of my life. It was only when I came to be bisexual in my twenties that I stopped being afraid of not being that preconceived notion of the hetero male. I embraced my love of dance, song, fashion and romance for the first time in my life. I didn't worry so much about being a stone facade of strength, and learned to appreciate the strength of grace. I learned that I could be soft, that I could be sexy. I learned what it felt like to let a strong and gentle man put his arms around me. I feel good wearing tight clothing that flatter you in just that certain. Of course I am missing some anatomical importance, but I've learned that boys have liked me because in some ways I am feminine.

I don't want to be a girl though. I am happy being a boy. I just...I am happy being what I think a boy can also be. I just find it very difficult, most of the time, to be myself because of that disparity between the behavior everyone expects of you and what I feel happy being like. I've only been able to be myself around a handful of people.

It's hard to explain to others that intangible feeling you get when you're around people that have expectations of you. It's like this unseen eye judging you. Like seeing a dour expression behind peoples' eyes. Like seeing their real face. It's...scary. I don't like seeing that side of people. Or at least...those kinds of people who look at you like that.

I deeply miss the one boy who, seeing behind his eyes, seeing his real face, would make me feel special. Like, a mixture of happy and lust and the beginnings of real love. I felt like, with him, I could be like a girl, but still be a boy. And I think for that one weekend he did love me.

I feel good wearing tight clothing that flatter you in just that certain. Of course I am missing some anatomical importance, but I've learned that boys have liked me because in some ways I am feminine.\n\nI don't want to be a girl though. I am happy being a boy. I just...I am happy being what I think a boy can also be. I just find it very difficult, most of the time, to be myself because of that disparity between the behavior everyone expects of you and what I feel happy being like. I've only been able to be myself around a handful of people.\n\nIt's hard to explain to others that intangible feeling you get when you're around people that have expectations of you. It's like this unseen eye judging you. Like seeing a dour expression behind peoples' eyes. Like seeing their real face. It's...scary. I don't like seeing that side of people. Or at least...those kinds of people who look at you like that.\n\nI deeply miss the one boy who, seeing behind his eyes, seeing his real face, would make me feel special. Like, a mixture of happy and lust and the beginnings of real love. I felt like, with him, I could be like a girl, but still be a boy. And I think for that one weekend he did love me.\n\nI'm sorry...I'm just feeling very sad and lonely today. Because of other things in my life I don't have anyone to talk to about these kinds of things. I'm still scared of letting people see me when I'm so vulnerable."", 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': ""Thoughts of a man that doesn't want to be what people think about when they think of men."", 'created': 1340588849.0}"
2012-06-24 23:28:22,vjm53,27,42,"I posted this on FetLife, and it got a good reception, so I thought I'd post it here as my introductory post. It's written for a general audience, not necessarily for those who are familiar with queer or gender theory. And I like I say in the opening paragraph, this is just *my* genderqueer manifesto. It's not meant to speak for anyone but me. Hopefully everyone who would want such a thing can and will write theirs too.

---

The very first thing I want you to notice is that this is titled *My* Genderqueer Manifesto. It's not *The* Genderqueer Manifesto nor even *A* Genderqueer Manifesto. This one is mine and no one else's. Just like my gender(s). And like my gender, I reserve the right to modify it on a whim, to update it to reflect new knowledge, and for it to be completely nonsensical to those outside of my head. Modifications, updates, and other changes may (and likely will) be made without this document ever being updated.

I am genderqueer.

In that big [QUILTBAG](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=QUILTBAG) in which so many of us hang out, you can find me in the Q and the G. G for genderqueer. Q for queer. But not Q for questioning. I'm not questioning. **I am the question.** My life, my identity, my practices are a big fucking question mark, and I love it that way.

**So what's it mean when I say I'm genderqueer?**

* It means sure, I'm a guy. Except when I'm not.
* It means sometimes I'm a girl too.  
* It means sometimes I'm neither, or both, or something else entirely.  
* It means I'm rarely a man, and even less often a woman.  
* It means that when I fix a car or build something that I don't feel manly or like I'm living up to the gender that is assigned to me. It means I'm really more of a tomboy in those moments.  
* It means that I'm not crossdressing when you see me in skirts and makeup. I'm not wearing women's clothes. I'm wearing *my* clothes, thank you very much.  
* It means you can refer to me as ""he."" Or ""she."" Or ""ze."" Or any other personal pronoun you prefer. They'll all be right enough, and I don't mind any of them. Well, except maybe ""it.""  
* It means that my beard is pretty and girly, at least when I want it to be.  

**So what does it not mean when I say that I'm genderqueer?**

* It does not mean that I want to start taking hormones or have my body surgically modified. Some genderqueer people do. That's cool. It's not for me.  
* It does not mean that I'm under any obligation to make my identity apparent to others. Most days I'll be in slacks or jeans and a button down. You'll likely not actively notice anything about my gender.  
* It does not have any bearing on my sexual orientation. I'm mostly attracted to women, and also to other genderqueer folks. I'm sometimes attracted to guys. None of that has anything to do with my gender identity nor with my gender expression. I'm just omnomsexual. ^1    
* It does not mean that I feel I was born in the wrong body. I fit my body perfectly. I am my body. My gender and my body are inseparable, but that doesn't mean that I let others assignation of gender to my body limit me.  

I notice that my expression of gender varies along with where I am on the extraversion/introversion spectrum. The more extraverted I am, the more stereotypically feminine I am likely to appear. The more introverted I am, the more stereotypically guy my appearance will be.

Usually.

But no matter my expression, I am always genderqueer.

Even when you can't see my queerness, it is there. It is who I am. It is how I am. Forget that if you prefer. My queerness is not your responsibility, and it does not need your recognition. But forget it at the risk of failing to see and understand me.

&gt; Queer is a territory of tension, defined against the dominant narrative of white-hetero-monogamous-patriarchy, but also by an affinity with all who are marginalized, otherized and oppressed. Queer is the abnormal, the strange, the dangerous. Queer involves our sexuality and our gender, but so much more. It is our desire and fantasies and more still. Queer is the cohesion of everything in conflict with the heterosexual capitalist world. Queer is a total rejection of the regime of the Normal.

&gt; *[Toward The Queerest Insurrection](http://zinelibrary.info/toward-queerest-insurrection-0)* 

I refuse to let myself be managed and policed and limited by narrow, binary gender. I am both/and/neither/nor. I am ""Yes, ma'am,"" ""Yes, sir,"" and ""I don't know what to call you.""

I am a walking, talking, living, breathing question mark exploding every binary that tries to catch me.

2012-06-25 13:23:33,vkjmg,9,12,"Hello folks!

I'm currently attempting to gather submissions for a magazine idea I have. If I can get enough submissions I am going to start a Kickstarter fund to at least put out one issue. But first I need submissions!

My magazine idea is called ""Intersections"" and it focuses on feminism/gender issues and how it intersects with all the other -isms out there because I feel that there are way too many publications out there that just focus on a white/cis/straight kind of feminism that perpetuate gender binary and are far too exclusive of anyone who falls outside that sector. That being said, I want submissions from *everyone,* but what I'm looking for is diverse viewpoints.

What am I looking for?

* Prose
* Poetry
* Photography and art
* Essays
* Columns
* Rants
* Reviews of movies, books, or anything pertaining to gender

On what subjects?

* Identity
* Fashion
* Love
* Politics
* Gender
* Sexuality
* Sex
* Humour
* Lifestyle
* Dysphoria
* Seriously fucking anything that you consider relavent

If you have anything at all that you would like to see in print, please message me for my email address. Obviously I can't pay you (my dream is to one day be able to pay contributors), but what you get out of it is a byline, a piece for a portfolio, and glory, of course.
