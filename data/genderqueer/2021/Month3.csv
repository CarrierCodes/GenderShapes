I dealt with some major homophobes the other day and since then, I can’t sleep, I feel sick and light headed and what they said to me is eating me alive. 

Some of the things they said were:

-I was an animal ready to be shot 

-I am and deserve nothing 

-I’m an object/not human 

-I deserve disrespect 

-I should be gassed

All because I’m genderqueer. They demanded I respect their opinion (their opinion that all of lgbtq was a joke) I literally couldn’t fight back. They talked over me and just kept spewing insults and threats. I couldn’t get a word in. They wouldn’t have listened anyway.

I got misgendered and humiliated several times and I can’t function. Advice or kind words would help tremendously. I just needed to get it off my chest.

I  just wanna share that I made a sort of breakthough with my gender stuff  by realizing that I don't have to keep trying to feel good about my  body, feel like I belong with girls/women, or identify with womanhood in  general. I can just be me, the sad genderless blob who feels  uncomfortable with some of their parts and can't seem to actually feel  that famous sisterly energy of womanhood or whatever it was I thought I  had to feel, even though they really tried.

That  came after over a week of shaking and stressing and not sleeping  because I was thinking about whether or not I'm repressing something  gender wise and why oh why do I feel so much affinity with a trans  friend of mine. Well guess what, it's probably because I likewise do not  identify with the gender I was assigned at birth.

I  was putting a lot of pressure on myself with regards to the gender  stuff over the last few years. I was ashamed of not being able to feel  at peace with my body, not being able to heal that disconnect I feel  between that thing and myself. I guess one of the reasons is that a lot  of my identity is based on being a trauma survivor, and I like to think  of myself as someone who overcomes things. Like, a professional  self-healer. And I'm also big on the idea of acceptance so I thought the  end goal for me was supposed to be able to accept my body the way it is  and accept the fact that everyone sees me as a woman.

I'm  not sure how exactly it happened but I eventually decided that nope, I  don't have to accept everything. I can instead acknowledge the  disconnect and the uncomfortable feelings and maybe even, like, do  something about them.

I once had a  conversation with my former therapist about acceptance and I told her I  wanted to accept myself or something along these lines. And she asked  if I think I will also be able to accept the fact that I can't accept  something. I don't know what she meant but I remember at the time  thinking that hey, that could be about my assigned-at-birth gender. And  right now it feels like that's what's happening, I'm finally facing the  fact that there are things I can't really accept.

So  that was happening over the last few days and today I found myself  feeling happy and free for the first time in a long while.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry for how long this got, I just sort of rambled because I've never told anyone these things until last night when I opened up to my partner who admittedly is even less knowledgable about this stuff than me. 

(this is a throwaway I created to post something a while ago and then chickened out)

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm AFAB and currently identify as she/her (though that's not a choice I made so much as a default I feel I was given). I've always just assumed I'm cis because for a long time I didn't know there was anything else. I've identified as bi/pan since I was around 10 years old (I'm now 26) and gender has sort of never been a thing I cared about or understood and now in my 20s, I've come to the conclusion that gender is just a made-up societal construct that, while I respect it and respect how people identify, I don't really buy into for myself.

&amp;#x200B;

It's like someone telling you that you're a Gryffindor or a Slytherin and I'm just like ""I'm not even a wizard, Hogwarts houses aren't real. They're just a fun idea"". I've never felt connected to my female identity. Like if I were to list all of the things that I feel are part of my identity and make me ME, being female wouldn't make the list. It seems weird that being a Hufflepuff is such a bigger part of my identity than my assigned gender. 

&amp;#x200B;

As an AFAB person, I'm a bit confused about what being NB would mean for me. I feel like I already can present fairly masc if I want to because society allows that in a way it doesn't allow men to present femme without judgment. So if I decide I want to go by them/them (or more likely she/they) what actually changes?

&amp;#x200B;

Gender and sex are two different things and I know I am biologically female and while I do have body dysmorphia I've always chalked that up to being a woman in today's critical society. For many years as a kid (honestly right up until I had my son at 20), I always had this weird paranoia that I was actually born a boy and that someone had done something to me as a baby and I would inspect myself and convince myself that it didn't look right and that any change in skin colour or texture was due to scarring from surgery or something. It was a weird thing I never told anyone about and I knew deep down it probably wasn't true but it was a weird fixation I had for a long time until I got pregnant and gave birth and can now say I'm pretty sure I'm biologically female). I also spent a good chunk of my childhood telling friends that I wanted to be a boy, but again I always chalked this up to the fact I knew from a young age how much harder it was to be female and I wanted that male privilege. I never ever thought I could be trans.

2021-03-09 12:04:05,m150zm,20,1,"I am a cis woman and last night I downloaded FaceApp for the first time and changed myself into a man on a FaceApp which has inspired a LOT of dysphoria in me and now I can't stop thinking of myself of the guy in this picture. It has kind of made me think of all the signs that I'm not cis and possibly a boy/man throughout my life. 

* When I was very young, I assumed I was going to grow up to be a man (I thought girls grow up to be men and boys grow up to be women) 
* I was a very skinny child and very happy - I become depressed during puberty because the curves of my body horrified me
* It took me a really long time as a young teen to accept that I couldn't wear boys clothes - in my mind, I wanted this skater boy style and tried to create a girl version but I was never happy with the results 
* I remember growing leg hair after puberty and secretly loving it 

In my adult life there have been a lot of signs too. 

* I identify as gay but I don't really feel like that label belongs to me, but any kind of sexual/romantic thing with men makes me cringe. But tbh, I'm not massively into lesbian sex either. I watch a lot of straight porn and the idea of having sex with a penis turns me on a bit - and I love having a girlfriend or flirting with girls etc.
* I am fairly good-looking but I still don't feel 100% comfortable in my looks - like I am kind of obsessed with my hair and clothes and always trying to 'feel right' 
* I am not very confident at all. I have slowly become more confident through self-love, good friends etc, but deep down it's something I really struggle with - but when I imagine myself with a man, I am confident naturally
* I love the idea of having kids but I don't see myself as a mother. I kind of hoped growing up that I would have a partner who would prefer to take on the maternal role and I could be a paternal role and that would somehow make it all make sense
* I have quite a slim figure and gaining weight (even to a 'normal weight') makes me feel depressed, I have virtually no hips which I'm very happy about but I always fantasize about losing more weight so my boobs get smaller 
* I don't feel like I fit in socially at all and I don't feel like many people know me or interpret me as I want to be interpreted. This is not a concrete thing but more like a general feeling or discomfort 
* I tend to only spend time and feel comfortable with people who are gender queer in some way, tbh I don't understand cis straight women at all - and I used to have a lot of cis guy friends who I felt more comfortable with than women but I'd always find they'd start wanting something more with me which would make me feel uncomfortable 
* I also try and work out to get more muscles but it makes me feel down that I wouldn't really get the look I want deep down. I like it when I get more muscle on my arms but it also makes my butt look bigger and wouldn't change my breasts. 

 I know this is all a lot. I think I could do with speaking to a gender counsellor or something. I just had to get it all off my chest to be honest with you.

2021-03-10 00:53:20,m1l7bn,0,1,"Hi everyone. I've just joined this community so it's lovely to meet you! I'm sorry, this is going to be a bit of a long post which also includes things about bisexuality. I'm just going through a bit of a crazy headspace at the moment. I should say there might be some stuff in this post which could be distressing. (POTENTIAL TRIGGER WARNING). 

I (21) currently identify as female and go by she/her pronouns, but recently I've been thinking more and more that it doesn't fully encapsulate how I feel inside. 

I've always had a fascination with androgynous fashion (like the singer La Roux), and when I was in highschool I cut my hair short, dressed boyish and came out to my friends as bisexual. However, I came out to my mom when I was about 14 and it really wasn't a good experience. She basically mocked me and said that the only reason I was gay was because I wasn't getting enough attention from boys and I would get over the phase. She also told my grandma without my consent because she said that's the reality of being a ""dyke"" - everyone will know. I felt like I was pushed back in from that experience and ever since then I've always felt like a bit of a fraud around my sexuality. This feeling of being a fraud only got worse when I decided to grow my hair out again and I got my first longterm boyfriend. I kind of put any considerations about gender and sexuality on hold for years.

When I broke up with that boyfriend I immediately cut off my hair again (about 3 years ago) and started dating women. I felt a lot more liberated because with short hair I feel like I blur the lines between masculine and feminine. I also moved in with some flatmates who are bisexual and I feel a lot more validated in my sexuality (although I still feel like a fraud because I'm in a het-passing relationship).

However, now I'm realising that the reason I like having short hair is because I might not be a woman after all. I've also got big boobs which I've hated and hid for a really long time and I think it might be because it makes me look more obviously feminine when I don't want that. Recently I've been increasingly noticing that when people ask me my gender or my pronouns I'm hesitant to answer because ""woman"" or ""she/her"" doesn't fit. My flatmates have called me things like ""the flat dad"" because I do stereotypically ""manly"" tasks like get rid of spiders, and that's always made me feel fuzzy inside because it's a male-based term of endearment. I think seeing more representation of non-binary/gender non-conforming people on shows like Drag Race has kind of make me realise woah, I can be that? 

But I guess I'm really worried about coming out because I'm worried about what my mom is gonna say because of past experiences. I'm worried she's going to make out like I'm a freak and not accept me. I also come from a small town and I don't think the rest of my family would get it. 

I'm also worried because I have a boyfriend (been together for 2 years) and I'm not sure if he would want to be with me if I came out as genderqueer/non-binary. I told him a few weeks ago that I was experiencing a bit of a gender crisis and he was really understanding but last week I mentioned that I'm going to take the plunge and seriously look into booking breast reduction surgery after COVID (it's something that I've mentioned many times but I've always been scared about the procedure) and he said he would find me less sexy and be less attracted to me if I got the operation. That really hurt my feelings because it makes me think he might not be attracted to me if I'm more authentically myself.

I guess I'd love some support/kind messages/advice from anyone has experienced a similar situation.

I\'ve just joined this community so it\'s lovely to meet you! I\'m sorry, this is going to be a bit of a long post which also includes things about bisexuality. I\'m just going through a bit of a crazy headspace at the moment. I should say there might be some stuff in this post which could be distressing. (POTENTIAL TRIGGER WARNING). \n\nI (21) currently identify as female and go by she/her pronouns, but recently I\'ve been thinking more and more that it doesn\'t fully encapsulate how I feel inside. \n\nI\'ve always had a fascination with androgynous fashion (like the singer La Roux), and when I was in highschool I cut my hair short, dressed boyish and came out to my friends as bisexual. However, I came out to my mom when I was about 14 and it really wasn\'t a good experience. She basically mocked me and said that the only reason I was gay was because I wasn\'t getting enough attention from boys and I would get over the phase. She also told my grandma without my consent because she said that\'s the reality of being a ""dyke"" - everyone will know. I felt like I was pushed back in from that experience and ever since then I\'ve always felt like a bit of a fraud around my sexuality. This feeling of being a fraud only got worse when I decided to grow my hair out again and I got my first longterm boyfriend. I kind of put any considerations about gender and sexuality on hold for years.\n\nWhen I broke up with that boyfriend I immediately cut off my hair again (about 3 years ago) and started dating women. I felt a lot more liberated because with short hair I feel like I blur the lines between masculine and feminine. I also moved in with some flatmates who are bisexual and I feel a lot more validated in my sexuality (although I still feel like a fraud because I\'m in a het-passing relationship).\n\nHowever, now I\'m realising that the reason I like having short hair is because I might not be a woman after all. I\'ve also got big boobs which I\'ve hated and hid for a really long time and I think it might be because it makes me look more obviously feminine when I don\'t want that.

2021-03-13 13:43:51,m46jj5,7,1,"Morning, peeps! I have some questions concerning my gender and queerness and I don't really have anyone in my life to ask. So please be patient with me.

(I am a cis woman questioning queerness) Over the year of covid I have been discovering things about myself. I discovered I was bisexual. That was big. I grew up in a very generally -phobic home. But didn't quite feel I could call myself queer just for that. 

Then I decided to cut most of my hair off. I've never liked having long hair. Just took this long to get the nerve to finally do it. I've mainly dressed in between masc and femme my whole life. No makeup. I decided to stop shaving my legs recently. Like I've often felt good in unisex t's and skinny jeans. Simple earrings, ponytail always (due to my natural state being short-haired but not getting to that point till recently), watch on wrist (always preferred men's watches much better aesthetic).  

I would/do occasionally wear my hair down and wear skirts and dresses. (Still no makeup though). I never felt completely out of place dressing femme. It feels good enough. But I also felt good dressing more ""comfy"" or ""mix of both masc and femme"" sort of. Like the jeans that are more for women but then the guy t shirts and I love Converse shoes too. 

ANYWAY. All of that to say... When I was soon to be getting my drastic haircut, I had this odd fear that seeing myself with shorter hair would cause me to question my gender. Why? Not sure.  BUT when I did get it cut it didn't really trigger anything. I mean I consider the cut to be rather short but still femenine.  

BUT yesterday, I had to take my pet outside to pee. It was morning so I had my pajama pants and sleep shirt on. The pants are from the men's section because men's clothes are made better in general and have pockets. Lol.  So to go outside I threw on my boyfriend's flannel jacket. While outside, I caught a quick glimpse of my reflection in the garage window. It's not a mirror so the reflection wasn't super clear. SO when I got the glimpse, my own reflection to me looked like a dude (from the shorter hair and the guy's pants and jacket)   And. Oddly, I liked the feeling of it??  Like it's almost impossible to explain... 
So later that day, boyfriend is at work, I tried on a pair of his pants and threw on a t shirt just to see what it would feel like. (We weigh almost the same so I somewhat fit into his clothes. Lol) and I felt comfy in the them.    Does this mean I would feel comfy dressing full masc in public? I don't know.

But I do know I also am comfortable enough dressing femme as well, and my natural state is in between somewhere. 

One other aspect I was considering is that I think a lot of my want to dress in a way that accentuates my femenine body (example wearing tighter jeans with the t shirt tucked in to accentuate my bust more) could absolutely be a result of comp-het behavior. That ingrained from birth feeling to want to please the male gaze, to look sexy for men.   I have that a lot, I know I do.  

So I was trying to figure out... Am I fully binary woman? Or am I not quite there? Could I or should I identify as queer or genderqueer when I still feel completely comfortable with she/her pronouns? Because I wouldn't feel the need to ask for they/them pronouns. If anything I would probably identity as a queer woman OR genderqueer woman. ?

Or should I just say, hey, I'm just a woman with masculine qualities to her, I'm a tomboy at times or whatever. And leave it at that? 
Because I feel femenine but also somewhat masculine at the same exact time. So I wouldn't consider myself an identity where I feel like a woman and then like a man at other times. My gender feeling doesn't seem to change and flow, but more of solid state of feeling a bit like a mix of both at all times. 

What is this? Is this just a somewhat masculine women? Or different?

I’ve struggled in the past posting about this, so please be kind; I don’t want to be misunderstood. Obligatory “Not All AMABs!”

I have had several interactions over the past few years where amab non-binaries have used their male-presenting privilege to either belittle, interrupt, talk over or silence me. They get served first, even though I’d been waiting longer; they’ve used their size to stand over or intimidate me, etc.. This has from memory never been during discussions about gender; apart from with an ex where he would try to attach his experience of closeted, masculine (he/him) non-binary to my experience as an openly, transitioning (they/them) non-binary, which felt more like narcissistically trying to one-up me than actual invalidation. But he used a *lot* of instances of being Tall, well-known (small town, we’re in the music scene) Male-presenting authority to do shit I could never, usually calling in favours &amp; people excusing a lot of bad behaviour cuz he’s just a Cool Guy. These other interactions usually happen the same way that cis straight men talk over/invalidate/insult/sexually manipulate me; so if you’re femme/a woman/afab, you probably know what I mean by this. 

I suppose my reason for posting is, is I also feel like I cop a lot of sexist discrimination &amp; men hitting on, touching &amp; acting inappropriately to me because of my *perceived* gender - &amp; it hurts like a bitch because I really am trying to look more androgynous to avoid gender dysphoria &amp; misgendering... but I continually come across amab non-binaries who seem happy to benefit from &amp; use their male-passing privileges.

2021-03-15 20:22:24,m5txcu,16,1,"Hello, I am asking this question quite straightforwardly because I can't understand exactly what's going on in my mind right now.

I suppose I should start by saying I'm a 30 yo AFAB.

This whole thing started for me when I was quite young. I suppose, that I can say I would range from being a tomboy to being a princess in a few minutes. When I was in school boys made fun of me and my body and my body hair and that was all very painful. They'd say that I wasn't a real woman and called me names.

I also started to identify quite closely with the suffering and abuse that women in my family were facing, sorority became something really important to me. Being as a woman became a war cry almost - and I welcome trans sisters in this group, of course.

The problem here is that I can't understand where I stand and I am growing increasingly discomfortable.

I don't do makeups, I don't wear dresses. There are a few things about my body that I love, like my hair. But that's all. I don't dislike anything that much. I bought a perfume now and force myself to use it, but in general I feel a disconnect with any aesthetic gender expression.

It feels to me that trying to be one gender or another would feel to me almost like wearing a costume, which is exactly what I feel in the rare occasions when I have to wear dresses.

I considered getting a binder and trying to see what I look like, but I don't understand nor do I know how to start.

**So why does it matter to you what you look like?** Can you share your answers with me?

I feel like I'm not a woman, but I can't accept that I'm not a woman because I don't wear dresses or makeup. I feel like that would be giving reason to those school bullies.

So what is it that makes me uncomfortable with myself?

I was reading a work email this morning about the new policy around pronoun use. All very nice and sensible, but then I read the bit where there's a suggestion/expectation that cis people add theirs to email signatures to show support and help normalise things.

I'm AFAB and have been questioning my gender for around a year now- eventually settling on the 'non-binary' label. I started the 'coming out' process about nine months ago and pursued some educational efforts regarding my they/them pronouns with my closest friends; I even started using the title ""Mx."" in my classroom while I was teaching!

But considering patriarchy, who does?

Am I just really apathetic? Or something else entirely? Patient and kind-hearted people say it's up to me. But that just leads me to stalling with further questioning. 

Dysphoria-wise, I've never liked my breast. But that's because they're huge, inconvenient, and bring unwanted attention from people of all genders. Not to mention, I have childhood trauma from my mother basically calling me a whore and telling me what to wear just because I had large breast. 

So it's hard to tell if my dysphoria is based on gender or the very real tribulations I've faced from simply having breast. 

I also don't like the concept of coming out. I'm queer sexuality-wise too but my pursuit for sex from people of all genders doesn't really need an introduction in my opinion. Similarly, I don't think my gender does either. 

But to be fair, I come from a staunch conservative family where if queerness isn't joked about for sport, it's quite literally labeled the gateway to hell. While I've never internalized this, I do wonder if coming out would seem more organic if this wasn't the case.
