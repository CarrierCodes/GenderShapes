2021-02-08 21:55:52,lfmz6n,1,1,"Hi, um so recently I've been following more accounts on Twitter that talk a lot about being non-binary and I realized I didn't know much about people who identify as non-binary. I started doing research on what it means, how to be respectful, common mistakes people make about them, etc. 

The more I learned the more I thought, ""Wait, I feel like this sometimes."" But I worry that I don't feel the same way as others, that I don't meet the...requirements? (I'm laughing at myself for saying that but that's how I'm thinking of it) I'm bisexual, and to be bisexual it means you like men and women, so I just feel like for me to say I am non-binary I need to match the requirements for it. I've read people saying that it feels different for other people but I'm still worried I don't feel it enough...?

For example, I have ADHD, I was born with it. When I tell people I have it sometimes I get this response, ""You do?! I think I have it too! I get distracted *so* easily."" And that's it. That's their only explanation for possibly having it, and it's very annoying to hear people say this. I don't want to be those people when it comes to me thinking I'm non-binary.

I was born female. I have always hated wearing very ""feminine"" clothes or accessories. I'll wear some nice fem looking clothes but I hate dresses, heels, and purses, etc. It's always felt that they don't ""fit"" me. For a long time, I mainly wore ""masculine"" looking clothing growing up because I felt like it was more me but that caused people to bully me saying I was actually a guy. I've thought for a long time about if I wanted to be a guy and my answer has always been the same, no. But things that men typically do, wear, say, etc. are things that I like but I also like things girls typically do. Not everything for both genders but enough that people have either mistaken my gender or asked me if I am trans, or if I want to transition. 

To me, that seems like I could be non-binary for feeling connected to both but not fully. But then I get in my head, ""You just like things boys do. That doesn't mean you are non-binary."" ""You're bi, it's normal for a bi girl to like guy stuff and also girl stuff"" I don't know...It's just kind of confusing to me, and I just don't know if I could be. 

If I am though I feel like I would identify with pronouns she/they. I don't want to identify as he because that doesn't feel right to me, but staying as she does. But I also feel like I don't fully fit in with being she...

2021-02-11 23:16:01,lhxo4e,1,1,"So this is an issue I've been wrestling with for about 2 years now, and have yet to find any good resources for: due to large breast size, I can't find a binder that doesn't cause back pain during/after use. Last time I talked to my doctor about this (like six months ago), she recommended trying to ""customize"" my current binder (a 3XL full size tank from gc2b) via DIY methods. It sounded like it would involve a lot of trial error, something I don't have the patience or pain tolerance to do.   


I've actually stopped wearing the binder for a while now. The amount of time it would take before it starts hurting was a crapshoot; anywhere from 3 days of healthy use (i.e., no more than 8-10 hours) to just 2 hours of wearing it. I would even try spacing out the times I used it, like once a week or every other day, and there was NO discernable patter for when I'd actually feel pain. Like sometimes I would only start feeling pain the morning after I wore it, as opposed to while I was actually wearing it.  


Because of the pandemic, I'm home most of of the time so it hasn't been much of an issue and I just wear my sports bra if I need to be in public. But I finally got a new job and I'm going into work on a regular basis. And now I'm getting pain from the sports bra as well. I think I just got used to going bra-less most of the time because I have to take it off as soon as I get home. I'm only going in three days a week, but it's pretty noticeable most days.  


I'm curious to know if any other curvy AFABs have had similarly frustrating experiences with binding, in terms of finding a binder that fits and/or unpredictable pain from using a binder that you initially thought fit just fine.

Anyway, I am so, so scared that this gel is going to cost more than I can afford, and I just... won't have testosterone anymore, just like I stopped having birth control.

First, I understand trans people are absolutely valid. I know so many of them and they know exactly why they do what they do and I absolutely respect and love them and I don't want my story to be pitted against anyone to invalidate anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

 I am AMAB. I experienced homophobia in school and I think it gave me PTSD that lasts right to this exact moment. 

&amp;#x200B;

Trauma scares me and I haven't been dealing with it all my life. Gender roles have always been something I have always been very intuned to, even as a kid. I began to identify as the ""female"" in the relationship but I think patriarchy and our western socialization really did a huge number to me, I am quite impressionable because maybe it has to do with me being emotionally stunted and never really truly developing a core identity.  I don't feel like I have identities, maybe we don't need them? That's what Buddhism teaches me. Talk therapy doesn't work. I have been on every anti-depressant pill. Being a sissy fem boy was not really validating or affirming, or is it just the negative connotation? 

I have been on estrogen for many years, I feel like I am happy with the changes, but at the same time, there is an issue in the back of my mind that keeps coming up, did I transition as a coping mechanism?  I still feel depressed, traumatized, and generally more vulnerable in some way because while I pass (which is why I said  its a coping mechanism, but I do feel good about other people referring to me as she and her) 

I think my point is because I never had the urge to have any surgery because that's more trauma than I can handle and not enough pain for me to go through them, I feel even more invalid and fraud.

For context I’m AFAB and I started exploring my gender identity at age 14 or 15 (I’m 19). I started calling myself genderfluid or genderqueer, cut off all my hair and even used a different name and used they/them pronouns. But I live in a pretty non-progressive, conservative-esk town. My family was pretty unsupportive and my friends were honestly worse. I got a lot of backlash for being pretty out and got a lot of heat at school. I also had an emotionally abusive friend at the time who majorly gatekept me from the LGBTQ community. So Basically majorly suppressed all of that until quarantine started back in March. Even then I didn’t unpack my sexuality until after I had turned 18 and some of my gender identity questions have come back up 

My problem, is I’ve become super accustomed to masking (I’m nuerodivergent) and often find myself with a false sense of identity and becoming the people around me. I struggle a lot with knowing who I really am and idk if this is my identity or if I’m becoming like the people around me as I’m more immersed in LGBTQ culture. 

I don’t feel like I truly identify as a woman 100% but I’m not a man and I don’t feel like I’m neither. I want to be feminine in the way that gay men are feminine but I don’t believe I am a man.

I also had an emotionally abusive friend at the time who majorly gatekept me from the LGBTQ community. So Basically majorly suppressed all of that until quarantine started back in March. Even then I didn’t unpack my sexuality until after I had turned 18 and some of my gender identity questions have come back up \n\nMy problem, is I’ve become super accustomed to masking (I’m nuerodivergent) and often find myself with a false sense of identity and becoming the people around me. I struggle a lot with knowing who I really am and idk if this is my identity or if I’m becoming like the people around me as I’m more immersed in LGBTQ culture. \n\nI don’t feel like I truly identify as a woman 100% but I’m not a man and I don’t feel like I’m neither. I want to be feminine in the way that gay men are feminine but I don’t believe I am a man. The point of this post really is to know if other people have struggled with this or have similar experiences or advice they could lend. \n\nMuch love, stay safe and healthy &lt;3', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Suppressed or false sense of identity?', 'created': 1613740452.0}"

1. No trans person wouldn't want to transition. 
2. The only reason someone wouldn't want to transition is other people being assholes
3. You are a troll.

I didn't detransition from a woman to a man... I detransitioned from both woman *and* man.

I came to realize that consciousness is not man or woman, *its both masculine and feminine, and neither at the same time.* That's who I am. I realized I didn't have to conform to social standards, peoples expectations for what I should be based on my sex or my presentation. I can just be myself. I can express myself in a masculine manner if I want, I can express myself in a feminine manner if I want... My *gender* doesn't matter...

I am still **obsessed** with females... do I wanna be one? No... I like my male bits... I still want a girlfriend. I still want a... well I don't *want* a boyfriend, but I like being intimate with men too. My desire for both of those things lead me to change who I was to conform to social standards of which the people I desire subscribe to. Rather than being myself, I tried becoming a caricature of what i thought *they* would desire... And frankly it works wonders, but how dreadfully unfulfilling it is to wear a mask when being intimate with someone...

I believe this Man and Woman dichotomy which permeates throughout our society (particularly in the westernized civilizations) stems solely from ""the game."" It stems from building predefined ideas of who a person should be, how they should dress and how they should behave within the confines of the structure just to make it easier for people to get together... If you subscribe to these standards, and you seek someone who subscribes to these standards, then you know what you ought to expect from each other, because you both take upon the roles that have been designed by the culture. It has been this way for eons, changing as time goes by, and frankly it can be highly beneficial to the societies that subscribe to this gender binary.

I appreciate what it is, but I simply don't feel I can subscribe to this social game, not if I want to express myself as *myself*. Does this absolutely tarnish and mangle my ability to find a long term partner, especially a cis woman who subscribes to the social gender game *(these women are most appealing to me, what can I say...)?* Absolutely, it makes it more difficult, in my experience at the dating game as a gender non-conforming person. They expect in a partner a certain type of behavior, either by a man or a woman, be they cis or trans. I cannot fulfill that role in either case. I may have a leg dipped in each role, but I have not and refuse to dive headlong into either side for the sake of companionship. And that's okay. It's okay that most people subscribe to the gender binary social structure, and it's okay that I do not. It's totally possible that some cis girl out there who presents herself along the standards of how some part of this undulating mass of society deems she ought to, may in fact *be* interested in someone like me as their long term partner... A rarity not impossible... Either way...

I realize now that I really must give up my persuit of my ideal partner, and in doing so give up trying to conform to this binary game, and just be okay being a non-conforming male, not a man, not a woman, just a wacky xy penis person with tits, stubble, painted nails, dresses like a pirate rockstar, and sounds like Michael Jackson.

I fantasized a lot during that time about being female. I don't classify my cross-dressing activities as a disorder. It's just I wasn't able to function normally in my daily life because of these thoughts.

I know it is somewhat controversial but also I see that the description of autogynephilia, exactly matches with my experiences. I become easily aroused sexually by the thought that I have a female body. 

I am mostly heterosexual, and don't feel atracted to masculinity and male sexual organs. But I also feel easily aroused by thinking about a male penetrating my imaginary female sexual organs.

Its my first time posting here.

I recently ""discovered"" that I was non-binary and its just confusing. I have all these mixed feelings about myself and I don't feel valid at all. It seems like I can't figure out what I want for myself and it's starting to be so overwhelming.

First of all, I'm AFAB and I prefer go for the they/them pronouns but I don't mind if ***sometimes*** i get refered as a she. But like no more than one sentence... It's just so weird. 

I'm in a relationship and my girlfriend supports me a 100% and I'm really grateful for that. I like when I get called ""baby girl"" or ""girlfriend"" or ""future wife"" by her, but I don't like being refered as a woman by anyone else. 

I also would like to change my name at some point for a more neutral one but I don't feel like I deserve it because of all the questions I have about myself.

It's just so hard because I've never felt more comfortable with myself than since I came out to my girlfriend and close friends, but also all the changes are getting overwhelming and I'm scared it's gonna be overwhelming for them too and ending up leaving me.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve started a diet in order to thin myself out but my large arms will still be a problem and unfortunately my torso is straight up just built like a door.\n\nThe only way I can see myself being able to appear more androgynous and be able to look good in feminine clothes is with Estrogen but I don’t want some of the things that come along with taking it. The thought of having breasts makes me feel really uncomfortable and I would become even more dysmorphic than I am now.\n\nIs there anything I can do that not as permanent as Estrogen and short of having any surgeries like bone sculpting? Would testosterone blockers work on someone already done with puberty? Any help would be appreciated.
