I do know, however, that for the most part I like being treated and seen like a guy.

So I'm on this language app. I showed photos of myself presenting feminine, obviously a girl. There were a lot of pervs so I ended up changing my profile to me dressed as a guy. I hated the male attention, but now I'm getting female attention. It's honestly not even bad! I prefer it a bit more. However, I mostly prefer the attention I get from guys as a guy. They treat me like a man and call me bro and man and dude and whatever the hell else. It's just so nice. It makes me feel comfortable. I like being treated like a man more than I do a woman. I have for a very long time, but this whole ordeal with the language app has made me realize it even more.

One thing that makes me sad though is that they eventually find out I'm a girl. I have references that use female pronouns, or they ask to see other photos of me (I don't have many of my looking like a guy). So I eventually tell them that I was born as a girl. Then they end up treating me differently. It sucks.

So far I tried seeing where I am and I'm still unsure but here's what I think I am. Genderfluid I feel fluid with my gender for sure I think. Female, I do feel fem I'm born fem but idk I don't know I've been confused about it like when I feel fem at first I feel good and confident mainly because sadly I'm the gender I'm ""supposed"" to be. But then I noticed fem is never the same it kinda goes down from there like its drugs or coffee high at first then going down. I'm confused like how much female am I supposed to feel to be female so now I question if I'm a weak female, fluid with female, or between male and female but a stronger female side. Being between fem and masc had felt good I think only twice when I started questioning and tried to understand my feelings towards gender.  SO I question if I have three genders or two because being between male and female kinda felt like a separate thing.

I'm AFAB and have used she/her my whole life, and for the most part I'm cool with folks using those pronouns. I've been thinking a bit about adding they/them, but I'm not sure. I don't really experience dysphoria, but my views on gender as a whole have been evolving.

As I'm learning more about gender and identity and stuff, I feel like the societal concept of gender is kind of a scam to try to make us buy certain things, act a certain way, and let those privileged and powerful retain their positions (if this makes any sense). I know there's a lot more to it than that, and I'm not trying to crap on folks who think otherwise.

I've never fit very comfortably into the box labeled ""woman,"" but since the binary is stupid in the first place I have generally just tried to just present however I felt without changing my pronouns or anything, because why should being female mean I need to present a certain way?   I guess I shift pretty flexibly from light masc to light femme depending on my mood.  I've been considering calling myself agender, but I haven't seen many people identify that way so I'm not sure about that, and I have spent a long time just trying not to care since I didn't want to make a fuss.  Recently however...Things have changed a little, I read some stuff and I'm suddenly realizing that there are some things I'm more confused and uncomfortable about than I was letting myself believe.

Namely, my chest, or what's on it.  I have always hated them, but since I've been struggling with anorexia since high school (pretty much under control now, but the dysmorphia will probably never completely disappear) I figured that it was just related to that and kind of moved on with my life.  It's very odd, because I am mostly comfortable with my genitals and having a uterus.  I don't mind the idea of childbearing, which seems at odds with disliking my chest/being trans in any capacity, but I honestly have no idea.

I've been struggling a little more with presentation than I'd like to think, too.  Little things like I love collared shirts and t shirts but hate the cleavage or visible bumps so I don't like to wear them.  I hardly have anything to complain about honestly since I'm pretty small to begin with, but I had this realization and it was kind of crazy how much more comfortable with myself I can imagine being if I didn't have them.  I realized I didn't really hate my torso (which I've hated for my whole life even before the other body issues), I just always gloss over my breasts since they've never felt comfortable or very much like mine.  (It's also odd because I'm attracted to women and I can like..step back from them being mine and objectively say that I have a decent, if a bit small, set of breasts) I don't even really like people touching them, but I have fantasized about people touching them if they weren't...well, breasts, and were just a chest.  It's bizarre because I'm not even uncomfortable with all things femme - I have femme aspects to my personality and self that I don't mind.

Since I don't /think/ I want to take hormones I feel like this means there's something wrong.  Why the heck would I not want breasts??

I'm sorry, this became a bit more rant-like than I'd like.

So recently I have been questioning my gender identity. Right now I identify as a female but I have been questioning that.

There are some parts of my body I would like changed too like I wouldn‚Äôt mind having more masculine hands, having  a bit deeper voice, short hair, and smaller boobs, but not completely flat. At the same time I wish I had curvier hips and a more feminine facial structure.

I thought about this too myself and I wouldn‚Äôt mind being called other genders like, she, he, or them, but at the same time I wouldn‚Äôt care if someone would refer to me only as she or they and would be uncomfortable being referred to as only he.

There are also some situations I imagine and being ok with. For example if I was a ruler I wouldn‚Äôt mind being referred to as the queen but also it feels nice to be referred to as a king and it would make me feel powerful.

Ranging from the media to clothing, I love it and am married to an amazing woman who is extremely supportive. My two kids don‚Äôt know anything different other than loving my for my quirks. So I have a really safe and healthy space. Along with many exceptional people in my life. 

I‚Äôm seeking to better understand myself to also share with those I love so they can better understand me. As I‚Äôve been exploring and investigating my thoughts, I have realized how little I‚Äôve ever really felt a need to think of myself as male. I‚Äôm born with the genitalia and obviously have testosterone in my body as I can keep mild muscles without working out. As I‚Äôve been exploring gender, I‚Äôve realized I don‚Äôt have a draw to be identified, by myself or others, as a female. Male is fine. I‚Äôm pragmatic and it doesn‚Äôt bother me to go by such. But within societal context, I enjoy many things feminine and don‚Äôt really connect with masculinity. 

The language for this gray area of experience doesn‚Äôt feel easy to pin down for myself. I‚Äôve been reading an arrange of things and just don‚Äôt even know what kind of words to use to describe this in a more concise way. I think my core desire is to be me and enjoy the things I enjoy. Me isn‚Äôt a gender. It‚Äôs just...well, beautiful me. 

A couple of years ago, some friends of mine saw me walking down the street with an electric keyboard (I was using it for a play). One of my friends asked the other, ‚ÄúWhy the fuck is Luke walking down the street with a keyboard?‚Äù The other shrugged his shoulders, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just Luke doing Luke things.‚Äù They later told me about this exchange and it just CLICKED. This was before I started actively exploring my sense of gender. 

Since then, it‚Äôs been one of the most empowering ideas for myself. I love it. Luke doing Luke things. It‚Äôs perfect for ME. 

So...all this is to ask if others have had similar experiences and if so what you learned and how you talk about it?

Any thoughts on helpful labels?

Like, I basically lived my entire LIFE as a boy, and although I was adopting new labels and different genders, I was still primarily a boy. So saying ""you might be more girl"" was kind of a BIG step for me. And I was also testing out all kinds of pronouns and neopronouns, and everything was going crazy... but throughout it all... I was kind of not making any progress? Like, I couldn't really think about my gender really that well? And most pronouns I was trying out just weren't working?

And the opposite seems to be true for AMAB people.  I see a lot of AMAB enbies who have long hair and wear makeup and dresses and it reads as androgynous because it's often paired with natural ""masculine"" features, like a deep voice, flat chest, facial hair, etc. I like playing with makeup, wearing long flowy skirts, and having feminine, chin-length hair and those things don't give me dysphoria personally because I don't think of them as being ""women's things"", they're just ""*my* things"". Even if I understand that these things are feminine in our culture, I don't really see them as inherently more feminine than I feel inside. But the expectation for AFAB enbies seems to be short ""boyish"" haircuts, small to non-existent/non-visible breasts, pants and shirts, and if any makeup or jewelry is worn, it's generally a more alternative style that tends to read more androgynous. And of course I know that there are plenty of non-binary people who *don't* fit into these stereotypes and in the last few years I've seen a lot more people who present pretty typically for their assigned gender coming out as nonbinary (although it's been mostly AMAB people that I've seen.) But even though I know I can present however I want and that doesn't affect who I am inside and most NB people I've encountered have been completely accepting of all different kinds of gender expression, I still feel like I can't escape gendered expectations. The thing that gives me more dysphoria than anything else (aside from my massive tiddies) is knowing that the way I feel comfortable presenting is interpreted differently by others than the way I see it. Like my medium-short hair feels a lot less femme to me than my old, longer hairstyle and the thought have having long hair again makes me uncomfortable, but I know very few people are going to look at my hair and see anything other than a woman's haircut.
