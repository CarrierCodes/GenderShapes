2016-06-01 09:29:26,4m0eqi,0,7,"Almost nightly I dream of being magically switching into the body of a woman. I'm born a man but this dream hits me hard in a way that makes it impossible to ignore. 

I like the newness of it. The sexual exploration that often comes with the dream is enjoyable but the big thing is something that lingers. The idea of just being a woman and having everyone have to accept that without knowing how is liberating. The thought that I could stay that way is exhilarating. 

It's made me realize how enjoyable it would be to be a woman like that. To just one day be. To experience it all, to truly feel that side of me would be enlightening. 

Then I wake up. A part of me mourns that loss of experience but another part of me is relieved that I can continue being me. Experiencing masculinity how I can and throwing in touches of femininity where my existence allows. It's grown me so close to my wife, seeing her world through a lens many other men might not think to look through. 

It's a side of me I can't shake nor want to. I often hope for these dreams to come. To live a moment in that fantasy where reality doesn't have to interfere. I don't feel the need for further exploration but a part of me always wonders and pushes to determine if there's a way to live closer to both parts.

Not even both parts. Both isn't the right word. I'm not male and female nor am I just male with fantasies. There's a part of me I know that's not defined binary. I just haven't found the way to be that. Words and labels can't define that place I want to be in. It often feels like the experience of others comes close but doesn't quite match what I need. 

I so greatly appreciate the support of a community such as this and the strides society has made to make it easier. Some day I hope to not only find a way to live the self I feel I am, but to also be able to step into that being as seamlessly as if it were a dream and that no judgement would come of it.

2016-06-01 21:54:22,4m3sst,2,12,"One thing that bothers me a lot about gender and gender roles is overgeneralizations that people make, statements in which people make an untrue generalization, like: ""Women are so blah-blah-blah..."" or ""Men are so blah-blah-blah...""  I'm especially bothered by ones that include all-or-nothing or absolutistic language like *always*, *never*, ""all women/men..."" or the like.  Another thing I heard a lot growing up are statements about ""real men / real women...""

I think these statements are one of the ways in which gender norms are enforced.  I think the statements contribute to defining the cultural constructs of gender.  The statements can be a positively-worded statement that defines a traditional gender norm including both positive and negative statements like: ""Women are sensitive and sweet / moody and emotional."" or ""Men are strong and assertive / insensitive and pig-headed.""  I think these statements can often be at the heart of misogyny and sexism, as well as transmisogyny and the shaming of femininity.  I think they also manifest in man-bashing that I see among women (i.e. making sweeping dismissals of men, rather than raising specific concerns about specific behaviors), which I think can itself be a way of reinforcing transmisogyny and indirectly, misogyny (especially because when women rant negatively about men, it downplays or erases men or male-identified people who don't fit into whatever stereotypes were being thrown around).

I tend to feel a visceral dislike for these sorts of statements and I tend to identify strongly with people who object to them.  I think that because these statements are made both about women and about men, these statements have contributed to me identifying both with women and men, especially with people who resist these sorts of statements or characterizations.  So like, I identify with both women and men, in terms of both of these groups of people being groups that are sometimes negatively characterized (or forced into ""positive"" characterizations that don't fit them and that can be coercive when people don't fit them), and so I can empathize really easily and intensely with people who break these things, including people who still feel like cis women or cis men.  It's like, because I identify so strongly with these things, it makes me feel like my own identity is split between the true groups, and lies in a neutral ground, outside of the generalizations.

I think that these statements capture one of the key or deepest aspects of how I experience gender.  First, I don't feel like I fit the stereotypes.  I'm AMAB and it was pretty evident as a kid that I didn't fit the ones about boys well at all, nor did I want to grow up to fit the ones about men.  But I also found that my friends who were girls, as well as adult role models, both women and men, often broke a lot of these norms / generalizations too.

While I liked the calming effect they had on me, I didn't like certain side effects of Spiro - I got lots of muscle cramps and was thirsty all the time.  The bigger side effect I didn't like was how the hormones effected my libido - I really didn't like how it became more difficult to get hard, and my semen diminished.  It felt like the hormones were taking away something I've identified with since puberty, and it was mainly for that reason I have stopped.

I'm aware that I wasn't on hormones for a long period of time and really didn't get to experience the physically feminizing aspects of them.  I strongly didn't like being chemically castrated, and just don't know if I'm trans enough to go through all the pain and suffering this journey requires.  

Its taxing.  Its determination.  Its real.  Its a hard hard life full of costly procedures and discrimination.  

Part of me wants to continue taking pills and part of me understands why I don't want to.  

I'm really conflicted.  In an ideal world i would be so androgynous I could change my gender depending on what clothes I wore and how I presented myself.

Since my late teens I have had feminine thoughts and homosexual/bisexual/sissy thoughts in times of anxiety and low self esteem. When I have indulged these thoughts,mi have felt good in the moment, but in the long run it has lowered my self esteem even more.

I got to a period where I had no confidence with talking to girls. In this time, I would watch porn and fantasize about being the girl.

In my early 20s I found sissy hypno. It intensified all these things.

I've never been with a man, but i go through spells where I think about it, especially when porn binging/hypno binging.

When I am off the porn, I don't think about it as much, but when I do, it beckons to me.

Lately, I have been considering buying some girly supplies and trying crossdressing, but a part of me  thinks that will hit my self esteem in the long run even know the instant gratification might feel really good.


I guess I'm confused. There are often two forces....maybe more.... But two major forces pulling me. One force seems masochistic and submissive. This force seems to originate from low self esteem.
The other force is altruistic and ambitious, it seems to come from the need for a legacy and to put my mark on the world.

I want to indulge the dirty force from time to time, but I don't want to play with fire. I'm in my mid 20s now. I think this force has bitten deeper in to me. Although, like I said, it dies down when I drop the porn.

what does this say about my gender? Do any of y'all have any advice?

Im about 80% sure im some form of nonbinary. When I started transitioning I did the whole pendulum swing and went to the far opposite end of the spectrum, the trans incarnation of a cis female. I made a very conscious effort to not suppress anything  (as I have my entire life with my gender), yet somehow I still managed to.

After well over a year of ""I am a woman I am NOT a third gender"", I opened up to my girlfriend to tell her there were times, not infrequent, that I still felt like a man. We explored the ideas, what it means to be a man and what it is men ""feel"", and of course it's just confusion.

Still, it would be dishonest of me to say its not in there somewhere. Gender identity is something you feel, something you know. You usually know it, even if you cant explain it, you just do. There are times I feel male. No explanation, it just is.

I want to embrace that. Its a part of me, it is me. 

The problem is, it seems to only be a source of pain. Not only that, but it doesnt line up with my gender expression or physical attributes very well. In fact, when I begin to feel male, it increases my physical dysphoria. My make features stand out more to me and it produces a feeling of discomfort. In those moments I dont like how I feel, and I dont like how I look. Id give anything to be cis female. It feels as though I could cope better with the male feelings that way.

I want to be able to accept it, and ease the pain but it just doesnt work. I can tell myself ""maybe for now I can just be a sexy boy powered by estrogen"" , but that feels wrong. I dont want to be that.

Sometimes I think that maybe if I were smaller, more sleek, more able to shift between genders and pass as both,  I might be happier. But I dont even know, Id probably still feel *this*. 

As it stands, I dont want to be male, I dont want to be *both*. I know in my heart that I should have been born female. But I wasnt, I was born *this*, and thats how I feel. I dont think that will ever change. I wasnt born female and I dont know that I was born male really. Im both, or neither.

I have a 20 year old friend that was born male. She is 5'8 130 lbs and 20 years old. She's having trouble getting a prescription. I'm trying to help her in any way I can, but I don't know much.

Is there an online source for the proper HRT that is safe? Would you recommend that route?

2016-06-13 23:25:40,4nyhes,2,18,"hey everyone,

i've been doing a lot of really hard thinking lately. i was nonbinary id'd for quite a while but ultimately decided that social/medical transition to male, or medical transition to some androgynous state, was not ultimately right for me. right now i would say i don't really have any sort of gender identity, i locate myself in ""social space"" as a woman and will affirm that to other people, but it's not something i am attached to in any identity sense. oddly enough i have gotten much less feminine and more comfortable in my body since i started conceiving of myself this way. i still have dysphoria, but it is manageable, and i don't consider it an impediment to having a liveable life any longer.

one thing that prevented me existing stable-ly in a nonbinary/genderqueer identity, including an ""agender"" identity, was that i was in a lot of pain from dysphoria and the identity didn't seem to do anything to resolve my pain. having an inner identity never explained where my dysphoria came from or  how to deal with it, i guess. when i was heavily questioning myself about accessing transitional care i read a lot of nb/gq stories, including of people who transitioned, and related to them really closely. i devoured a lot of material and spent years on tumblr talking to people who were in the same position as i was. but i really felt like i was rarely digging into my issues in a way that actually... helped me? 

i was suicidally depressed and stuck in an emotionally abusive home on top of everything and felt similarly about that. relating to other people only helped me so much. i questioned how i was living every day but could never find a way out of my situation; it was like i was convincing myself into staying stuck sometimes out of fear and the conviction that i had no future ahead of me.

i was very public on the internet about my gender questioning but when i asked questions of other people or wrote about what i was going through, all i got were affirmations of my identity (which wasn't ever even clear) and some platitudes about starting transition (which i wasn't even sure i wanted). i didn't need that stuff! if i needed validation, what i needed was people to hear that i was hurting and confused and that i was worth responding to with care. 

i feel terrible saying this, but i feel like when you question in the trans or nonbinary communities, people just think you need to accept some inner thing in yourself or something (your cis/trans identity or whatever) so they try to build that up in you. i know i didn't need to hear that i was trans for sure, or not trans for sure; it's not like anybody could tell me that anyway. i feel like when people ask those questions they are really asking something like this: is it possible to live given the way i feel, is it possible to have a future at all in this world? and nobody addressed transition or dysphoria management from this perspective for me, except maybe to answer awfully in the negative.

honestly, i felt like the super-affirmative nature of a lot of online communities drove me insane. i felt like nobody was listening to me! i felt like i wasn't even asking a question about my life half the time, because what does it mean to ask a question when you can get only one answer from people? heck, even questioning itself was supposedly a sign of my identity because people who aren't trans or candidates for transition ""don't question their gender""! 

i still relate to a lot of nonbinary and genderqueer people; i think i'm just basically a mirror version of everybody here. i didn't know living like this was possible though. i didn't know i could have a good life with gender issues. i didn't know i could hold myself in a liminal space and be ok. everyone said i had to plow through my fears and doubts and just bite the bullet and transition! but i am alright, i am holding on.

2016-06-14 04:53:48,4nztsx,6,5,"So, for my entire life, I've IDed as a cis-female. I suffered heavy teasing in school with having ""boy"" thrown at me as an insult, which made me cling to my femininity that much harder. Its an important part of my personal story, but one i don't usually share, because the trans/nonbinary/genderqueer community has had it so much harder.

But, recently when talking to some of my friends (all of whom, in this group, are either trans or nonbinary), i mentioned how i wish i had a penis. Not in a ""i think I'm actually a man"" way, or in an ""I'm curious"" way. I am not envious or wish i had the experiences that my trans women friends have had with their bodies. I was assigned as a woman at birth and enjoy and love being a woman and also really really wish i had a penis. As in, i would get surgery if i could.

My friends say this makes me genderqueer.

I guess i worry about insulting others in the community by calling myself that, since I've always seen myself as a cis-woman.

2016-06-21 18:07:14,4p60qc,42,40,"I'm feeling a bit frustrated this morning with these terms. I saw this post by a young transboy: ""I feel like transgender has become a 'fad' now. I have a friend who said 'why be cis when you can be trans' and honestly, as an ftm transman, I'm disgusted.""

Of course I am NOT okay with anyone who trivializes our experiences as trans or genderqueer people. But the comments following this post were to the tune of ""you're not really trans if ___"" or ""god I hate non-binary IDs just so they can feel like a special little snowflake."" Apparently according to this group of youth, you must adhere to the ""trapped in the wrong body"" narrative, knowing since you were a very young child that you were trans in order to be valid.  Sadly, a lot of these sentiments run rampant among adult trans people, too. 

Personally, it wasn't obvious to me I was non-binary for a long time. Didn't take hormones until I was 28. I thought I wasn't really trans because I like having my body (well, aside from breasts - had top surgery recently and am loving my body so much more now).  It took me a long time to realize I don't have to adhere to the common trans narrative in order to deserve to exist, be valid, and make necessary changes via hormones/surgery, IF AT ALL. That being said, I also don't think anyone should have to do anything at all to be seen as who they truly are. I support my trans-sisters and brothers who don't take hormones or undergo surgery. 

In a way, I sort of did choose to transition. When I admit that in other trans subs or in other groups in my real life, I'm met with a lot of hostility. Do my experiences then not count? I'm going through the same things as many other transmen - socially transitioning, physical transition, putting myself at risk for violence, being told I'll ""never be a man, you stupid little bitch"" and whatnot. I've been called a gender-trender to my face by trans people over the fact that I admit I actually enjoy my genitals. I know these people are called ""truscum,"" which I would never say to anyone's face. 

It worries me to see such young people (middle school aged) perpetuate what I see as just as oppressive as the shit cis people try to impose on us. There is no right way to be trans, and I feel further marginalized as a genderqueer, non-binary person. I feel morally wrong to exclude genderqueer, genderfluid, and other gender variant people.

Is it that people feel threatened by anyone who is questioning, then take steps to present their gender identity (whether in clothing, hormones, surgery, etc), then realized they are cis after all? I mean, is it not a good thing to allow for everyone and anyone of all genders to open up how they can express themselves?  I think it's good to do away with gender roles and expectations of gender presentations.

I'm not sure what's going on, but I just wish we would stop policing each other so much. The stigma of being gender nonconforming or trans is so great that I doubt anyone would want to trivialize it for their own entertainment. I believe you if you tell me you are trans, or genderqueer, even if you don't ""look the part.""

So, disclaimer, while I'm an ally of every gender and sexuality, I'm not 100% up to date on what's okay to say and what's offensive, so if I say something wrong, please gently correct me. It is not my intention to offend anyone.

Also, this got really long. I'm really sorry. It turned into a small rant.

I've been poking around this sub and other LGBT-related subs these last few weeks, trying to figure myself out, and I'm just getting more and more confused. I guess what I'm looking for is for someone to tell me ""what"" I might be so I can do a little more research. I'm sort of shoving myself into a closet, but I'm not sure what kind of closet it is!

I'm a 26 year old, straight AFAB. My entire life, I've just considered myself a tomboy. I still identified as female, but it was always a matter of, ""God, I would be so much happier if I were just born male."" I've always known I was different, but I've never had a word to describe myself.

But I never really felt transgendered, or like I wanted to transition to being male. I guess it was always more...resentment? Jealousy? Envy? That I ended up being female instead of male.

(This part might be slightly offensive; I do not intend it that way) I just generally hate most of what it means to be female. I hate my breasts, I hate that people expect me to be weaker than men (until I got fat and lazy, I prided myself on my muscles). I hate all the menstrual cycles, the potential to become pregnant, and all the hormone crap. I hate the things society expects of me, like wanting to be a mother, or wearing pretty clothes. I haven't worn a dress since I was 7, and I've been wearing pretty much nothing but t shirts and jeans since then. But, to society, I'm frumpy and just don't know how to dress well (well, okay, that's true...but it's also because I'm simply not comfortable in 90% of women's clothes).

I like sports. I like physical challenges. I like getting dirty, going exploring, wrestling with my dogs. I like cars, drinking beer, and watching violent movies. I know none of these apply only to men, but in my experience, society doesn't really like women who like these things.

I'm not attracted to women in the slightest. It's hard to explain, but if there was some 1-10 scale of how attracted to women I am, I'd be at -10. In the simplest, maybe offensive terms, I feel like a gay man trapped in a woman's body.

But then that's where I'm getting confused.

I started considering myself genderqueer somewhat recently (I'm not ""out"" to anyone because I still don't know what I am), but I'm getting so lost in all the different terms.

Am I trans? Can you be trans with 0 intention to transition (though I'd be *thrilled* if I could have top surgery)? Am I some demi-category? Genderqueer? Non-binary?

And, side note, I tried to have this conversation with the LGBT community and was downvoted to hell. Why aren't gender minorities ""allowed"" in the LGBT community? Because it's not a sexual minority? Or did I just run into a batch of negative people?

2016-06-25 10:52:51,4ps1so,3,5,"Its seems that I have 2 or more identity's in me that affect my gender.


I have a hard time figuring out which is more important and it's also hard to morph or mix them into one.

So I been on hormones (estradiol and antiandrogens) för 3 years now.
I started seriously thinking about being trans when I was 23-24 (I'm 30 now).

I discovered non-binary identity's quite soon after I started thinking about what I was, I have id as non-binary for the most time after 26.

But I'm sometimes also a woman.


Do you know what transhumanism is? and postgender?
I was heavily interested in it at the time I thought about being transgender.
I have always wanted to be ""something else"".
Actually I have wanted and want to be and android, an synthetic being.
But we are not really there yet of course.
But I feel a connection between me being non-binary and me wanting to be an android, synthetic being.
Cybernetics are expensive, hard to make and risky, hormones are cheap, you don't have to make them, just buy them and honestly I'm not going to be an synthetic being anytime soon, but I don't want to be a man, I don't want to be a ""natural"" being.

But at the same time I have had this thoughts I also wanted just to be a girl, although I have for the most time not considered me being born a girl, mentally, I actually thought I WAS a boy, but I could be a girl if I wanted.
There are various reasons I didn't and don't want to be a guy, it has a lot about sexuality.


Recently thou I been feeling more feminine, more like I could be a girl.
So much that I have started to say goodbye to my non-binary self on most sites and present as a binary woman.


But I'm also aware that it may be only temporary, that I will once again feel more comfortably being non-binary (genderfluid between aporagender and demi girl).

The thing is I don't wish to be genderfluid, its more that I seem I am, i would rather just be one of the two, either aporagender or a binary woman.
I don't like to mix things.


The things is I'm so proud about being non-binary (or rather being a ""unnatural"" modified being), I don't want to give that up.
But on the other hand, being binary has its advantages, mainly that its harder och maybe even impossible to get what I want from the health care, I want SRS but I'm afraid they won't allow me SRS if I tell them I'm non-binary, or even hormones if I tell them I actually want to be a android, a robot, a synthetic being.
I have also noticed that more girls show interest in me now that I'm presenting as a trans woman on dating sites.

It's so strange, I feel that being a girl could work, that I'm actually transgender from birth, I'm a girl born with defects. But I didn't think like that some years ago, then I was more like ""fuck the system, I'm going to BECOME a girl"".


Is it really possibly that I have become a woman thanks to the hormones?
Am I really flexible from birth about gender.
Or Am I so strong in my conviction in transhumanism that I actually have reprogrammed myself.
Or have I been a girl al along, just not realized it?

I can't decide if I'm that transhumanist, non-binary being that love to give a finger to ""nature"" and society about gender, if I'm just a natural girl.
The thing is I have a hard time being both, mixing them, I don't like to mix things.


The thing is I get a lot, more than anything else, pride and identity from being a transhumanist and messing with my body and gender, it's truly me, it gives me so much meaning.

I'm probably crazy, but that's ok, I rather be crazy and follow my dreams than being healthy but normal.



I don't know, I'm just so surprised that it's a possibly that I actually was transgender from birth and not only a crazy transhumanist being that just love to fuck with natures and societies expectations.


I fantazise about going the ""I'm a woman""-route just so I can get surgery, but then when I have everything, I'm going to come out as non-binary again, or as a transhumanist being, proving to the world that you can modify yourself, you can become what you want NO MATTER WHAT you were born as.




Basically:
I sometimes just want to be a girl.
I sometimes are a girl.
I sometimes wished I been born a cis girl.
I sometimes feel shame from being born a boy.
I sometimes feel non-binary.
I sometimes know I just a guy that have delusions.
I sometimes just want to say fuck you to ""gender"" and society.
I sometimes wished I was an android.
I sometimes wished I were nether a woman or a man.
Most of the time I get extreme pride, empowerment and MEANING from just going my own way, becoming what I dream of.

I’m also lucky, I’m lucky that unlike so many people like me I haven’t had to deal with gender dysphoria or feelings of dissociation for the overwhelming majority of my life. But starting two years ago my gender dysphoria was kick-started and continued eating away at me until I finally had to confront it this May. I had a pretty major breakdown and even considered a transition to the opposite gender, anything, as long as it would quell this inner turmoil, this friction, this stress, this constant urge to be more feminine than a cis-gendered male like myself was raised by society to be. After some therapy and time to think I realized that transition to the opposite gender would only cause further issues. I’ve always identified with so many masculine feelings and traits and I would miss all of these in my life. So here I am somewhere in the middle of two genders, more specifically the label I identify most with is Bi-gender:

“Bigender is a gender identity which can be literally translated as 'two genders' or 'double gender'. Bigender people experience exactly two gender identities, either simultaneously or varying between the two. These two gender identities could be male and female, but could also include non-binary identities.”

Myself, I feel like I deviate between 80% male 20% female and 70% male 30% female on a day to day basis and depending on the people I’m currently surrounded by. Like many extroverts I tend to feed on the energy and acceptability of those in my immediate vicinity.

So you might be asking yourself, why I would I put all of this out there for people to read? So many of you go about your lives being correctly recognized and liked for exactly who you are and who you present as every single day - this is a privilege and I hope that you recognize it as such.

Well this was my first Pride and I went out (came out?) in style. Sometimes you just want to wear a sundress, ya know?

But here I find myself, two days and two dresses into Pride being unable to share what has been one of the most powerful experiences in recent memory with the wide audience of people with which I occupy most of my time. It’s unfair and downright tragic in my mind that I should limit my expression on such a momentous week and time in my life with just the people that supported me during this time out. When I first walked into R Place on Thursday I expected to be some person’s object of derision or at least distraction but instead I was welcomed by many open arms (literally and metaphorically) and I celebrated with a mind fully at ease. As I walked Broadway today people smiled, waived, paid me compliments, asked to get pictures with me, and best of all understood that I was expressing (albeit in an over the top fashion) a part of me that was integral to my identity with a sense of Pride. As I walked home from that event with a bag full of clothing that I dare not wear off Cap Hill, it hit me hard that I felt it all needed to stay private for fear of being found out, outed. It’s completely disgusting and I won’t personally perpetuate this need to feel disgusted and ashamed of who I am any longer.

Hi. I’m Jeremy, and I’m trans.

But starting two years ago my gender dysphoria was kick-started and continued eating away at me until I finally had to confront it this May. I had a pretty major breakdown and even considered a transition to the opposite gender, anything, as long as it would quell this inner turmoil, this friction, this stress, this constant urge to be more feminine than a cis-gendered male like myself was raised by society to be. After some therapy and time to think I realized that transition to the opposite gender would only cause further issues. I’ve always identified with so many masculine feelings and traits and I would miss all of these in my life. So here I am somewhere in the middle of two genders, more specifically the label I identify most with is Bi-gender:\n\n“Bigender is a gender identity which can be literally translated as 'two genders' or 'double gender'. Bigender people experience exactly two gender identities, either simultaneously or varying between the two. These two gender identities could be male and female, but could also include non-binary identities.”\n\nMyself, I feel like I deviate between 80% male 20% female and 70% male 30% female on a day to day basis and depending on the people I’m currently surrounded by. Like many extroverts I tend to feed on the energy and acceptability of those in my immediate vicinity.\n\nSo you might be asking yourself, why I would I put all of this out there for people to read? So many of you go about your lives being correctly recognized and liked for exactly who you are and who you present as every single day - this is a privilege and I hope that you recognize it as such.

Unfortunately my situation means that I can't buy female clothing, or really alter my appearance in any meaningful way right now. But I'm hoping that will change completely before the end of the year :)

So why am I looking for friends? Well part of me feels that if I can't dress or look the way I'd like to sometimes, well at least it would be nice if I got to act more feminine when I felt that way. I want to get to know this new person inside of me, what her interests are, how she acts with other people.

2016-06-28 00:24:20,4q6lsd,2,3,"Hey guys,

I'm not really sure where to begin on this so I guess I will give a little backstory on me. I'm AMAB, but when I was in preschool or so I hung out with pretty much exclusively girls. I remember playing with girly toys with them, such as My Little Ponies (I was a bring before it was cool) and my mom even has a photo of me in a princess dress from that time. This continued, at least to an extent into the beginning parts of elementary school, though I remember at the time my main motivation for hanging out with those girls was that I thought they were attractive (I was quite the player back then ;)). However I did have some male friends at that time, and as I got older my friend group shifted to more male. During middle school my school friends were male, though I had some female friends I liked to text with that I met outside of school. When I went into high school however, I remember one of the main things I was looking for was female friends -- partly because I felt like I fit in with them better, and also because that's something I really didn't have any of in middle school and so I wanted to do it just because I could. I did find myself in a primarily female friend group, however drama went down and I got the boot, so I found myself in another sausage fest. However the group is VERY LBGTQ heavy (out of the five other core members, only one is straight, and the statistics are similar, though less extreme for some associated groups), and while overall I only have two female friends (both from other associated groups), I have five AFAB friends, so there's a good amount of trans representation too. A few months ago, I begun to fall for one of my friends, who is AFAB but is genderfluid (though they have been slowly transitioning to a guy's name/he him pronouns). Around the same time, I broke down crying after my friends confronted me about being overly aggressive to them, and I admitted that I felt the need to do it to be seen as strong and manly. That was a pretty big turning point as I realized that it didn't matter if I was seen that way since it's just a dumb gender role, and I can be as girly as I want. At the same time I realized how distant I was in that aspect from some of my other male friends, and how much more emotionally vulnerable I was. I ended up mentioning some of this to the aforementioned person, and they were helpful, saying I may be bigender or something but I could also just be sick of male gender roles. I later caught myself mentioning to them that I wish I was a girl, but with a dick and stuff. Ever since then I've found myself browsing some of the relevant subreddits, like MTF, androgyny, genderfluid etc. however (and this is really embarrassing and one of the main reasons I used a throwaway for this) ive found myself getting off to it, specifically some of the pictures of the more attractive people. At the same time I find myself wishing to be them, ya know? Now the reason I mention one of my transgender friends that I have a crush on is because I feel like I could possibly be having these feelings because of them, but at the same time, I feel like they've always been in me to some extent (I clearly remembering mentioning to my mom in middle school that I wished I was a girl -- it was in response to some male drama that was happening at the time, but still). To figure this out, I remember sneaking upstairs and trying on one of my mom's dresses, however I felt somewhat out of place in it. However I recently dressed myself up in cat ears and some girly-ish classes and felt cute, not to mention at home. At the same time, I also realized I looked like my friend in them, and I never really felt the desire to look cute until I started falling for them (since they're very cute and not just in the attractive way), and I was getting off to it as well so I'm not really sure. Basically, is it just a phase I'm going through because I subconsciously want to be more like my friends? Is it a bizzare fetish? Am I actually genderqueer (or something)? I feel really confused, I keep wanting to androgonise myself more and be less of ""one of the boys,"" but I guess I'm just not sure why.

A couple final notes:

I remember another genderfluid person mentioning that they realized that's what they were when they couldn't figure out what gender identity they were, which really stuck with me.

In addition, I've noticed I act way more girly around girls and way more manly around men, though I suppose everyone does this to an extent.

At the same time, I've noticed this feeling has been sticking around more and more, but that's likely because I've been focusing on it more.

I'm AFAB and have struggled with gender dysphoria since I was tiny. In recent times I have confronted these issues head on and I've come a long way because of it. I've found profound relief in adopting a more androgynous way of carrying myself and dressing. On my severely dysphoric days, it seems to help with that ""whiplash"" feeling I used to get, where I'd wake up and suddenly just feel profoundly wrong. Now I feel more comfortable when that happens, and it tends to be much more subtle. 

However, I still have a lot of feelings regarding a low level of transition. Even on the days now where I feel the most comfortable in this female body, having worked hard to overcome feelings of self hate and low self esteem, I still feel wrong. I wish my voice was deeper. I can appreciate the form of my body, but I still don't want it. I look at my face, objectively nice looking, but feel at a loss with the undeniable femininity of it. And at the end of the day, even with all of my acceptance and even embracing of a birth body at odds with what is inside me, it bothers me to be gendered female, consistently. 

I read through pages of Testosterone treatment effects, stories of nonbinary folks on hormones, and trans timelines, and everything in my heart just sings with these stories. Except for one thing.

**HAIR.**

Maybe it's just a weird thing that I'm projecting/focusing on, but every single thing sounds great except for *hair growth*. I don't have a problem with hair on anyone else but myself. I've spent many years giving it a shot going all natural and I hated it. I shave my arms, my legs, my pits, and I do dainty landscaping on my fun zone. This is a constant- whether I'm feeling as femme as a disney princess or when I'm ready to just grow a cock already- I've always felt the most comfortable being femme, even when I'd prefer my body wasn't *female.* It's entirely possible that it would be a total moot point- that if I started T and began to look less female, it would be easier to accept body hair, but I'm not sure yet! The one that really holds me back is facial hair, though. I really don't want it. Like ever. I don't want to shave my face, or deal with stubble. Also when I have that thought, I feel like a bad trans person for hating the idea so vehemently :(

2016-06-30 16:16:42,4qmiiq,8,8,"Hey, everyone.

I'm in that questioning/self discovery phase of my life. I *know* I'm somewhere within the genderqueer family, but I'm still trying to figure out who I actually am. I'm AFAB, but I'm not totally sure if I identify as female (and just present as more masculine) or if I'm something else.

I recently watched [this video](https://youtu.be/Zg9y3cKDAmI) and in it, she talks about asking yourself *why* you do certain things. Like *why* do you shave/grow out your hair, or *why* do you wear certain things.

I liked this idea, and started applying it to myself. But the issue I'm running across is I can't tell if I'm doing some things because that's what I like to do, or because I have 26 years of society telling me how to be female.

An example (and probably a bad one) is shaving. I shave my arm pits because it's what I'm used to, but also because I smell *awful* (even with strong men's deodorants) if I don't shave my armpits.

But when it comes to shaving my legs, it's a toss up. On the one hand, I shave my legs because I like the feeling of smooth legs (I HATE wearing shorts and feeling my hairy legs rub together). But then I'm wondering if it's just because I got so used to society telling my that's how women's legs should feel.

On the other hand, I'm extremely lazy and I often allow my leg hair to grow pretty long, especially in the winter, because I absolutely HATE shaving, and often wish it were acceptable for women to not shave.

But, for this example, I keep thinking ""Do I shave because society has always told me I should shave? Or do I shave because I want to shave? Do I not shave in the winter because I like having hairy legs? Or just because I'm lazy as shit?""

I'm sort of over thinking everything, I think, but I also believe deep introspection is good for me.

I always present as male mostly because I don't think the people I know would understand if I told them I would rather present as female (no one in my family does, for a start), and I tend to enjoy interaction with girls more than with guys to the point that sometimes men kind of intimidate me (although I like nerds of any gender).
