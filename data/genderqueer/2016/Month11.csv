2016-11-02 20:09:57,5as85y,9,1,"As a youngster (13 to 18) I always wanted to be bigger and stronger. I am 6', but slender, have a little body fat in my tummy, thighs, chest, butt, etc.

I wanted to be more ""manly."" I'm not too endowed, average, I'd say, kinda on the thinner side.

I have a small chin, high cheek bones, thinner shoulders, soft skin for guy, etc.

Now that time has passed (I'm 25), I find myself not wanting to be more manly, but more feminine. I look to my penis at times and imagine it being a vagina. If it were a vagina, I would be more wanted, I would get more attention, I wouldn't have to try hard to be a ""man""' I could relax.

I've never been with a man. Growing up, I learned that men are mean. It caught me off guard. I was always nice and smiling. They were stern and combative.

Before I knew about sexual orientation. I did have crushes on girls. But there was a time when I called a boy ""cute,"" because he looked like a puppy. I was about 6 or 7.

Around 20 and 21, I found myself try to lose my virginity on sites like POF and adult friend finder. I did with an older woman, she was about 34. 

I didn't have too much more luck. On and off, I would anonymously look for a man. It was a rush.mi never went through with it.

That Rush was similar to the rush I got when I dressed in my mothers lingerie a few times. When I was younger, I used to run her stockings on her calf muscles when she wore them. I really liked how they felt. So about 5 years later, I think that was still in my mind at about 14 when I tried on some of her stuff. My brain released a lot of lovely chemicals at that time, because I felt amazing.


Long story short, I oscillate between wanting to be more masculine and wanting to be more feminine. Being more feminine seems easier to do. But it would turn my life upside down. Also, as I have had some inadequate feelings sexually, I find myself wanting to be with males sexually. This would negate being inadequate and also the thought of it gives me a rush.


I'm not sure what to do right now or what step to take. I go through spells of wanting to be feminine and be with a man.

2016-11-03 03:10:54,5auh89,1,1,"A little about me I guess.
AFAB, but I identify as agender. I recall being as young as 3 or 4 when I first told my mom something along the lines of ""I don't feel like a boy or a girl"" and it's been the same ever since. My mom and step dad are generally accepting of the LGBT+ community, and I have a ton of trans friends, and friends of pretty much every gender and sexuality out there, and they respect them all, but not really me I guess. I've had some major dysphoria lately, and I'm usually comfortable with any pronouns, but I specifically asked them very politely if they could possibly stick to they/them but they never bothered with it. While it wasn't a big deal before, currently, referring to me by female pronouns just makes me feel sick. Getting compliments on my /female/ body makes me feel sick. Anyone or anything used to refer to me as a girl makes me feel awful and just sends me further into my 9 year long depression.

I've wanted to start using my preferred name too, but I feel very uncomfortable bringing it up to my parents. Despite me technically ""coming out"" 14 or 15 years ago, they still don't take my gender seriously, or even my sexuality for that matter. They fully accept my agender friends, and my asexual friends, and my aromantic friends, but when it comes to me, I'm apparently lying to them and just don't want to admit to anything. They even try to constantly ""enforce the fact that I'm a girl"" and they've tried ""getting me to accept that I'm a girl"". I've never really had a good relationship with family, and I honestly plan on cutting ties with them when I get the money to move out of state (I'm 18 and I come from a lower class family, so it's going to take some time), but even though I live in a residence hall, I have to rely on them for transportation around town. I'd just like to make things more bearable for me, but they're not really willing to do anything to help me out, and I'm honestly just looking for some way to possibly get them to accept who I am.

One of the most common pieces of advice for questioning people and those who are not sure how to proceed is to experiment with presentation and to pay attention to how these changes make them feel. After I finally accepted that I had to do something instead of feeling sorry for myself, that sounded like I should at least give it a try.

Now, the confusing part is not so much how small changes made me feel much better than expected, or that after a while I can't even really imagine to go back to the way I did things before. At this point, it's mostly about allowing myself to like things and to stop pretending that I prefer other things just because I'm apparently supposed to.

The annoying part is that everyone and their second cousin suddenly tries to place me in a gendered box, even people who didn't seem to care about gender conformity before. For some reason, dressing androgynously, using unisex fragrances, changes in body language and so on don't signal ""Please don't gender me,"" but rather ""Gender me excessively and much more frequently than other people who express themselves in a stereotypical manner for their birth sex.""

thinking about the person id like to end up being, i feel like having a more feminine physical form would be great, id like to be strong to be able to protect myself and learn some discipline of marital arts(probably boxing/wrestling), be in shape and a good athlete(even as a guy im not really strong or able to protect myself)(also i really love playing basketball,wouldnt mind trying to play mens ball even if i transition). basically i want to not live part of a life, but a whole one. im not really afraid to do me and be different  (i really look up to allen Iverson and latrell spreewell, they did them and didn't care)

my worker mentioned that theres meetings i could go to that are open but i feel like i don't belong cause im still really unsure about myself and i feel like im intruding or overstepping (only ever identified as a cis guy and i have a big beard).

i dunno i guess a good way to describe it is being a reverse tomboy i guess. i don't really have an end question to wrap this all up. im just looking for answers

Y'all are some fabulous, brave, amazing individuals. Gender warriors. And if I'm really honest, all I have ever wanted was just to be a guy. Just an ordinary guy. 

I started out saying ""I'm a cis woman, I just hate being a woman and really really wish I were a man. But EVERY woman hates it and wishes she were a man, right? I mean, being a woman objectively sucks and being a man is objectively awesome, so everybody must feel like I do.""

I'll admit, it was overwhelming, and I didn't post again because it was SO much new information, and because this community thoroughly answered all my questions. I can't even begin to explain how helpful it was and how transformative it was for my outlook.

I had the chance to use my knowledge to politely educate a politician and also a business man (cisgendered) and both have, in turn, gone on to make positive changes in their circles. The big difference was just how kind and patient so many of you were, in spite of my ignorance, and I know that can't always be easy, since you undoubtably deal with willfully ignorant and rude people on a regular basis.

Anyway, I am volunteering with a young adolescent who is genderqueer, although they have sometimes referred to themselves as trans. My instinct is that they are still exploring and discovering themselves, but unfortunately they do not have a ""tribe"" other than people on the internet.

They are very intelligent, very down to earth, very creative, defiant (but I see past the defiance and recognize how kind they are -- the defiance comes from being in an unfriendly environment at school and at home.) They talk in a nihilistic way, with seemingly no hope or goals for the future. Death and dying are a regular talking point.

I told them that it gets easier to find your place as you get older. I mentioned that at my university, there is a very active genderqueer community, and there are even gender neutral bathrooms for those who prefer it (though bathroom use is a personal choice.) There is even a sexuality and gender minor, which I think they may really enjoy. (Because they talk a lot about genderqueer and trans issues, and because they have a level of intellect, introspection and quick wit that tells me it would be something they'd devour.)

Being realistic, though, I doubt there are many good paying, stable careers for gender and sexuality studies alone. I'm trying to brainstorm related areas to major in, where they might use the minor to be a powerful genderqueer professional who makes a real difference in the world.

I was reading the [AMA from the lady with XYGD](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5bemg9/iama_young_lady_with_xy_gonadal_dysgenesis_ama/) and it started me thinking about how there might be many related careers, such as endocrinologist, pharmacist, psychiatrist, social worker, etc. (I realize she is intersex, not trans or genderqueer, but an intersex person could consider themselves genderqueer, and she does have concerns that some trans or genderqueer people may share: hormones, medication, fertility, surgery, gender assigned at birth, etc)

I'm looking for your ideas, especially if you, yourself have found a career that is especially fulfilling because you are trans or genderqueer. (And yes, in the past, this community has educated me that sometimes a trans person considers themselves under the genderqueer umbrella).

Also, obviously trans and genderqueer folks don't necessarily find careers that have anything to do with gender, nor do they need to, but I'm hoping there might be someone in this community who has, OR, who has encountered a professional in their life who was particularly sensitive to gender issues and made a difference in your life.

2016-11-07 15:40:39,5bmt2w,4,12,"First off, apologies for making another validation post, I wish my first contribution to this sub was less self-centric.

I'm almost 100% to arrange talking with a counsellor - but I'm flapping in the breeze a bit about it - I'm worried that I might be taking my feelings too seriously, but I'm also aware that I've been strongly prone to self denial.  I'm hoping that someone has been through this can relate.

I don't know if I'm agender, genderqueer, dysphoric, trans or going crazy.  Either way, the realisation that there's even a problem has come pretty late at the age of 35.  I think genderqueer may best describe how I feel.

I've played as a kid outside gender roles, and was happiest with gender neutral pursuits.  I can recall various points where my play / thoughts were corrected. 

Gender was a neutral element in relationships - I never wanted to be 'one of the lads'.  Most of my friends were fringe/minority types throughout school.  In college I was part of an exclusively female friend group. I feel as though I've always connected with women better socially than men, but not in an excessive way.  

I've tried to hyper-masculinise at various points, I feel that I expressed masculinity and cissexuality, behind it I have always felt like I'm faking/grandstanding. 

I know I'm physically male, but I don't feel that my default behaviour expresses that at all: my intonation can shift between masculine and feminine, I don't chose to do that - I feel that I have a feminine approach to relationship maintenance - I try hard to mask this in certain situations, or playing it off like a man embracing some softness etc. (maybe around judgemental people)

Even now as an adult, I prefer neutral conversation - I don't feel comfortable in gendered groups.

I have a strange concept of self-image, I can readily accept my appearance, but, I don't always identify with it. It's like there's something off about it. I feel like a weird mix up. objectively I can say that I  have characteristics from both sexes.  Light body hair, generally less angular features, wide hips, shallow brow bone, big eyes and curled long eyelashes, and a round face which I hide with a large, but still patchy, beard. 

Internally I feel like I have both masculine and feminine character ideals of myself inside my mind. The problem is I don't know if I connect to either, or not at all.  I feel much more emotional connection to my feminine preferences (tomboyish geeky), while I've strongly absolutely denied myself these preferences, I feel that it bled out in my career as a designer/artist which is strongly feminine, I've been assumed as female through my art a couple of times.  It's almost like I feel this is the only way of expressing this side acceptably.  I understand dysphoria in a wiki sense, but I don't have a personal perspective, I can only wonder if this sounds like dysphoria?

I've always been interested in things about gender, trans issues etc - I rationalise it as being a superficial interest, but I tend to question myself when reading about these issues, but still never connected my own experience with being transgender.  It wasn't until I looked at this sub, and saw real-world people talking about their experiences that I connected the dots. Now I'm in doubt about myself, and confronting a lot of self-denial.

2016-11-08 15:59:54,5bu0vi,2,7,"Hi! So I'm so new to all the stuff outside of my own head that I don't even know how to talk about it really.

From quite a young age I was never particularly masculine, but because I never felt trapped growing up, aside from being pansexual and growing up in a small *rural* Australian city. Physically though I enjoy myself and never felt out of place in my own body. For years I just assumed I was a really fey dude. Someone who looked at the curves of their hips and despite the furriness and broadness of their chest found themselves focussing on those feminine aspects just as much.

I found out there was a term for this kind of feeling inside in June this year and it just clicked. I wasn't a feminine man or a masculine woman trapped inside the former. I was... Me.

So I found that Genderqueer as a term of identification of these feelings was closest to what I felt, and maybe I'm wrong so I wanted to ask if perhaps I'm getting it wrong... I don't mind being wrong because learning is the only way to move forward in the world. So am I coming out (because I've sort of done that before and it was scary) or am I transitioning? How do I talk to the people I love about who I am?

So I'm so new to all the stuff outside of my own head that I don't even know how to talk about it really.\n\nFrom quite a young age I was never particularly masculine, but because I never felt trapped growing up, aside from being pansexual and growing up in a small *rural* Australian city. Physically though I enjoy myself and never felt out of place in my own body. For years I just assumed I was a really fey dude. Someone who looked at the curves of their hips and despite the furriness and broadness of their chest found themselves focussing on those feminine aspects just as much.\n\nI found out there was a term for this kind of feeling inside in June this year and it just clicked. I wasn't a feminine man or a masculine woman trapped inside the former. I was... Me.\n\nSo I found that Genderqueer as a term of identification of these feelings was closest to what I felt, and maybe I'm wrong so I wanted to ask if perhaps I'm getting it wrong... I don't mind being wrong because learning is the only way to move forward in the world. So am I coming out (because I've sort of done that before and it was scary) or am I transitioning?

2016-11-08 20:31:21,5bvqks,1,4,"    I’m misguided goose,
    In a room full of ducks.
    An obvious atrocity.
    Disliked by those surrounding,
    Disliked by myself as well.


    Is confidence a thing?
    Or a mere illusion
    Because I feel fake as shit
    Through all this confusion


    What is a guy?
    A girl? 
    What am I?
    One of them?
    Both of them?
    Neither of them?


    Femme guy don’t cut it
    And masculine girl won’t either
    Why must I be one or the other?
    Why should I bother?


    My opinion is false
    My feelings are too
    You don’t care what I say
    But I’m a person too 


    Why must you decide
    What I can and can’t wear?
    I tried to shave my legs but
    “Boy, god forbid you dare!”
    Who are you to say
    Who I am, and who I can be?


    It’s about me, not you
    Forcing me to be like this
    Makes me feel like the ocean,
    Blue, cold, with lots of death inside
    I’m not not a meltable mold
    I can’t fit in with society


    So I’ll let you be you,
    And you can let me be me.

2016-11-09 21:23:25,5c3tk7,14,15,"Hey everyone. So I'm in an interesting predicament.  I am in the kendo club at my university, which is Japanese swordsmanship. We use hollow bamboo swords called shinai as our ""weapon"" (its more like a practice tool but I digress) Anyway so these shinai have different lengths and traditionally longer ones are used by men and shorter ones are used by women. Now when I started and bought my shinai all the women's shinai (I'm AFAB) were kind of beat up and the handles were already off-white because of use so I decided to buy a men's shinai (which were new in the plastic) Since my presentation at the time was ambiguous the person handing them to me couldn't tell my gender and just went with it when I bought it. Now its has come to light to some people in my club that I use a Men's shinai. Most of them people I am friends with and some of them just found out because we have a day where we had to take them apart and clean them. 

The thing is I've been read as female by pretty much everyone (at least by now) Initially there were a few people who read me as male, one of whom is probably gay and expressed interest (bless him) before finding I was AFAB after I mentioned leaving my phone in the women's bathroom (I seriously messed up there). In anycase I use the women's lockeroom to change, but at this shinai maintence thing I was told by a few people that I should use a smaller shinai. Also someone asked straight up ""Why would you use a Men's shinai?"" which hurt the most. Way more than I thought it would. Someone at the time said it good for weight training, which kind of backed me up but it still stung in a way I wasn't expecting.

There are many good reasons why I would use a ""men's"" shinai that have nothing to do with being genderqueer (higher weight makes for better strength training, longer shinai provides better reach etc.). The method of assigning shinai length is antiquated since it was developed in the relatively homogeneous Japanese population. Since America has greater disparities in height the gender division of the shinai is an artifact of the times. My friend who I get along with well in the class is a guy and a little shorter than me and he uses a men's shinai. Though despite me being a little taller I would traditionally not be able to use one in tournament. A really tall woman should be able to use a longer shinai in my opinion if it really is about height and stature.

As for how I want people to address me I'm okay with female pronouns, but when I'm reminded of things I can or can't do relating to being female I get antsy. I also sometimes pass for male and I feel pretty good when that happens, though I'm not considering any surgery or hormones. I also don't want to pass full time as a guy.

So I'm not sure what to do... I guess it's just kind of bumming me out and I want to know if anyone has any similar kinds of experiences or advice. I mean on top of this I'm grappling with the whole ""Is it just internalized misogyny?"" thing as well. Like why do I not like being considered a girl? Is it because of a limited idea of what woman are like or can be? Idk.... just rambling at this point. But any comments are well appreciated

2016-11-12 04:06:57,5ciscv,8,14,"So just a few days ago, after feeling VERY masculine and very dysphoric (I'm AFAB) for what felt like forever, I was going, ""OK, not genderqueer after all. I'm a trans dude. Simple as that. Time to accept it and move the fuck forward.""

I took a few baby steps. One of these was saying to my team at work (new job, been there a couple of weeks) ""Hey guys, I feel weird that I didn't mention this earlier but I was nervous around new people, but uh, you can call me Sam*. Or like if you call me Samantha* that's fine too, it's my name."" 

(My name isn't Samantha but you get the idea.)

I meant for it to be as low-key as possible but there was like a three-second period of awkward dead silence where I could almost HEAR my coworkers thinking ""WHAT? oh god have we been misgendering this person the whole time?"" (My coworkers are all the kind of awesome people who would feel bad about misgendering someone.) 

I didn't say anything about pronouns or whatever but I have been dressing very masculine and I think they picked up that it was a gender thing, because today one of my coworkers said ""Oh yeah, that's the thing Samantha and I were-- SORRY! SAM!"" and got really flustered in a way that you wouldn't get just calling someone by their full name instead of a nickname. 

I also came out to my (cis, queer, very much an ally) BFF who was predictably great, and another close friend who is a trans woman. I've been having a lot of really good convos with the latter friend about our experiences and it turns out we've gone through a lot of the same stuff. (My decision to get a boob job was very similar to her growing a very impressive beard before she was out.) 

The more I think about it, though, the more grateful I am that places like this subreddit and books like Gender Outlaws exist, because the thought of getting full-on top surgery, going on T, and ending up looking like Buck Angel (who is SUPER hot, don't get me wrong) is just as upsetting to me as trying to force myself to be a Woman. 

Part of me feels like I'm just being lazy or cowardly and this is an excuse not to go through another surgery any time soon (getting implants removed) or have to actually change my name or pronouns or go through any of that, but I don't really WANT to. Just being able to say ""I'm trans"" and stop trying to force myself to dress feminine and think of myself as a Woman has helped so much.

I think we've all encountered people-- both cis and trans-- who get mad at folks who aren't totally on one end of the male-female spectrum or the other. I encountered some comments on a different part of reddit yesterday with people complaining about how genderqueer people are an ""insult"" to ""real"" trans people who experience ""real"" dysphoria. Obviously this is ignorant. I know my dysphoria is real; that's the thing, I've been able to say ""I experience gender dysphoria"" FOREVER, long before I was able to admit that it made me something other than a cis woman. It's just that my dysphoria tends to be generalized, hating my overall (tiny) size and (curvy) shape and just getting extremely depressed over the idea of being female.

I'm a very nuanced person in my political views.  Respect and balance are very important to me.  I voted for Clinton in large part because I thought she was the more nuanced candidate, and I didn't like the simplicity of Trump's rhetoric. I didn't think Clinton was perfect, nor did I think Sanders, Stein, or anyone else was.  I was registered as a Republican and voted for Kasich in the primary (who I also didn't think was perfect), then switched my registration out of disgust when Trump got nominated.  I don't feel a loyalty to any party and I don't feel like I'm uniformly ""liberal"" in my political views.  I support LGBTQ rights and progressive taxation but I disagree with many things about the democratic party's stances. For example I oppose minimum wages and affirmative action, even though I feel strongly about increasing social mobility, promoting diversity, and addressing institutional racism.  I almost feel like there's a parallel between my gender identity and my political views.  Just like I'm neither female nor male, but share certain qualities with both, and am more of my  own thing, I feel similarly about political parties...I share certain qualities with both but have no loyalty to either and feel more commitment to my own values.

I'm terrified by some of the right-wing ideologies I see voiced by some of the people close to Trump, and I want to take action against these things.

But all around me, my left-wing friends are getting sucked into this sort of ""all-or-nothing"" opposition to Trump that I find troubling.  A lot of my friends are going to protests, and the people organizing the protests and the material put out by them, doesn't reflect my values.  And people are sharing stuff on FB that I really disagree with.  They are doing things like shaming Trump and his supporters as ""bigots"" and ""homophobes"" and ""racists"" and things like that.  It is against my values to ever use negative labels to refer to people.  I associate name-calling with the trauma of bullying that I had to put up with as a kid, and with the abuse and dismissal that sometimes gets hurled at me by other adults as an adult.  And like, it seems super disturbing for me to see people who claim to be my ""ally"", engaging in some of the behavior that I find most troubling and hurtful.  I don't care if they're directing it at someone who is trying to take away my rights, I feel like when people attack Trump and his supporters in this disrespectful way, they're attacking me, because I see their rhetoric as like, fueling this us-vs-them mentality that is just going to harm LGBTQ rights and all the other issues I feel passionately about.

I have read some things written by Trump voters and I know that it's more complex than this...that many of the people who voted for Trump actually support LGBTQ rights and voted for him for other reasons, like discontent with the political establishment, disagreeing with other aspects of mainstream liberal ideology, or the like.

I guess I wanted to throw this out there, I want to see if there are any other people out there, trans people and nonbinary people and other LGBTQ people who are terrified about Trump but also feel left behind, alienated, or even equally terrified by the extremism in the anti-Trump reactions.

I don\'t care if they\'re directing it at someone who is trying to take away my rights, I feel like when people attack Trump and his supporters in this disrespectful way, they\'re attacking me, because I see their rhetoric as like, fueling this us-vs-them mentality that is just going to harm LGBTQ rights and all the other issues I feel passionately about.\n\nI have read some things written by Trump voters and I know that it\'s more complex than this...that many of the people who voted for Trump actually support LGBTQ rights and voted for him for other reasons, like discontent with the political establishment, disagreeing with other aspects of mainstream liberal ideology, or the like.\n\nI guess I wanted to throw this out there, I want to see if there are any other people out there, trans people and nonbinary people and other LGBTQ people who are terrified about Trump but also feel left behind, alienated, or even equally terrified by the extremism in the anti-Trump reactions.\n\nI feel like I\'m constantly fighting this battle on my Facebook feed to urge my friends to be more supportive and to embrace love and to attack and judge policies, not people.

I've had a few people express confusion over my pronouns (they/them/their), so I figured I'd post a quick guide/FAQ.

Here's how to use they/them/their pronouns:

""Do you know if &lt;&lt;rivercitykitty&gt;&gt; is coming to the party? If they are coming, I want to play some Magic with them. I heard their new deck is awesome!""

(New pronouns do not change the fact that I am a huge nerd. Nothing will change the fact that I am a huge nerd.)

Frequently asked questions:

* **I'm probably gonna screw this up.**

* Yeah, probably. I appreciate you trying, and I know that there's a big difference between accidentally misgendering me and doing it on purpose. Don't make a big deal out of it, though! Think what you'd do on the street if you called a long-haired guy ""ma'am"" from behind-- a quick apology, ""Oh, sorry sir"" and move on. (Just, you know, *without the ""sir""*.)

* **""They is"" sounds wrong.**

* I agree! I prefer plural verbs, as shown above. You should know that some people do prefer singular verbs, and if they do you should do your best to accommodate.

* **Isn't it grammatically incorrect to use ""they"" for a single person?**

* A, no. It's common in spoken English, and has been seen in writing as far back as the 13th Century! You almost certainly do it daily. B, who cares? If a friend asks you to do something grammatically incorrect because it makes them feel better, do you hurt your friend or grammar?

* **Don't we already have a singular third-person gender-neutral pronoun in ""it""?**

* English also has a distinction between animate and inanimate pronouns, and ""it"" is inanimate, like ""these"" and ""those."" It's grammatically incorrect to use ""it"" for people, and there's also a long history of ""it"" being used as a slur. Don't do it.

* **Doesn't this make it hard to tell if I'm talking about one person or a group?**

* Probably a little more than you're used to, but not as much as you think. Most of the time it's obvious from context. If you're concerned about ambiguity, it's usually only a little effort to re-word your sentence so that the ambiguity goes away. And if you can't do that, just drop the pronoun and use names!

* **Why not other gender-neutral pronouns like ""xe,"" ""ze,"" or ""ey""?**

* Honestly, I think ""they"" is the most natural solution for gender-neutral pronouns in English. It rolls off my tongue better and is, I think, easier to get people to use. Obviously, I use specific constructed pronouns if people request them.

* **What should I do if I encounter somebody whose pronouns I don't know?**

* ""They/them"" is a pretty safe default, and most folks will not be offended if you ask, sincerely, what their pronouns are. I know that when people ask me, I'm pretty ecstatic. If you're shy, you can also listen to what their friends call them.

2016-11-18 00:58:45,5djlk8,25,50,"So, I'm born female, struggled with my gender and sexual identity all my life until recently. 

When I began dating the girl who I now know is my true love, she was so open and honest about her own experience with transition that it wasn't long before I tearfully admitted to her that I've always felt like my birth body didn't match up with how I wanted to be seen.

For a long time, I struggled with that big secret (""I want to be a boy""), and then- it was out. And then I realized, I had never considered what kind of boy I wanted to be, so in the safety of a few trusted friends and with my partner, I began to explore and give a voice to those long repressed feelings and desires. I began to read about non-binary trans identities and experiences, and to express myself in a way that was much more fluid and queer. I realized I always wanted to be someone whose identity was fluid, because cramming myself in a box on either side of the spectrum proved to be miserable in every way. I wanted to be androgynous. I wanted to move the slider over, so that no matter where on the spectrum I woke up, I could feel comfortable.

Finally, just last week, after months of consulting with my doctor, doing the bloodwork, and so on, he asked me if I would like to start my HRT that day. I balled up my fists and said... Yes. Why not? Let's do it. I only have one life to live, I want to start a low dose of T, and keep doing what was working so well for me- taking it a day at a time. Listening to myself. Seeking the support of community. And never trying to fit into a box again.

So far... well- psychologically the effects have been mindblowing. This last year, I've made great strides in taking care of my mental health for once, having never really done so. I stopped drinking. I'm far from better, but now I'm in a place where I don't feel like every step is a landmine. And within a day of that first injection... I felt so at peace. So unified. So calm. 

The best way I've been able to describe it is this: I've always thought of this dysphoria and this deep hurt and feeling of not belonging as having two people trapped in the same body, one of which who never really got a chance to thrive. Think teenage angst times 11. But finally, I threw my boy side a bone. I acknowledged that he exists and that he's felt trapped and upset. But now he feels validated, he's stopped throwing temper tantrums. He's even admitted that he's not particularly interested in the culture of masculinity, he just wanted to be heard. I know it sounds silly. 

But suddenly I feel so much more comfortable in my skin, long before any physical changes have happened. My partner said her psychological relief was almost instant when she began HRT as well, long before she experienced the physical changes. Now I understand it.

Currently, I am taking the HRT day by day. My plan is to continue with the half dose and just keep feeling it out. Do I want to fully transition? Do I want to continue on a low dose until I feel androgynous enough to stop? I'm not sure. I've already broken most of the ""rules"" and I've never felt more like my life was actually worth living, so I'll just keep living it, day by day.

I love you all and I just wanted to share- this community, among others here, helped me out more than I could ever say. If I hadn't secretly browsed /r/lgbt 4 years ago and wandered my way over to /r/genderqueer, I probably would have spent another decade drinking to blackout several times a week, resenting my cis partner and myself, cutting my skin and thinking about suicide constantly. That was me, a year ago. Now I am engaged in the gayest, queerest, genderless lesbian husband/wife relationship with the best friend I've ever had. 

I won't pretend things aren't hard right now, but I think these are the times that the positive must shine through for an example- I never would have been brave enough if it wasn't for all the beautiful, visible queers shining like stars and giving my repressed, miserable self some hope, something to strive for.

2016-11-19 01:51:43,5dq8l9,5,9,"Hi, friends! I've been lurking here for too long, and I finally decided to make an account to join the community, mainly for selfish purposes (I wanna get advice from all you wise genderqueer elders). Warning: I'm about to overshare about my mental health (and use too many parentheses).

So I'm eighteen years old and just started college. I'm finding myself completely unable to make friends. I have horrid anxiety issues along with a healthy dose of depression. There might also be some PTSD thrown in there resulting from a very emotionally manipulative friendship a few years back (I'll spare you all the details, but suffice to say it still keeps me up at night). Aside from all that, I'm quite suicidal and can't imagine myself living too much longer.

Meanwhile, I've been wrestling with some gender issues. I started wondering over the summer whether I might not be the female everyone thinks I am. This came from a variety of things: I was mistaken for a boy twice in a row (ironically, since then, I have not managed to pass as anything but female) and realized I liked it. I then experimented a lot with masculinizing makeup and was overjoyed to see my new ""male"" face. I also became more aware that when I heard people talk about me, I felt prickly and sick, like I wanted to punch someone and throw up and cry at the same time, which was different from the way my anxiety normally made me feel. I began to realize that this got a thousand times worse when they used ""female"" terms and pronouns for me. I had never deconstructed and analyzed my anxiety like this before, but it seemed to make a lot of sense.

So for a few months, I asked some of my close friends (while I was still at home over the summer) to use they/them pronouns for me. It felt so much better. I was thrilled to come to college, away from my homophobic/transphobic family, and start over by introducing myself with they/them pronouns to everyone. I was much too naive. Everyone here still sees me as a girl, no matter what I do, and they seem to love throwing ""she""s and ""hey girl!""s in my face. Before this summer, I had never hated certain parts of me, I was rather indifferent to them. Now I hate my name and my voice; I don't despise my chest quite as viscerally as the other things, but I secretly ordered myself a binder and sobbed with joy once I put it on, because it felt like my body was finally shaped right. I keep having dreams that my arms and legs have grown thick, wonderful hair (I don't know why, but I'm really fixated on body hair, lol).

And yet, true to form, I'm worried about all this. My mental health is so completely unstable that I don't think I can know for sure who I am. What if I just made up my identity because I'm lonely and I'm desperate to justify why I don't fit in? What if this is somehow coming from that traumatic experience years ago? What if I'm just hoping part of my anxiety is due to dysphoria because dysphoria is something you can physically fix?

I don't know. I'm lonely and I'm tired. I wish I could go to sleep tonight and wake up with a new body and start over completely. (Or, y'know, not at all, but that's probably not my best option.) Anyway, I was hoping maybe someone here would understand and be able to help me. Does what I'm going through sound like dysphoria, or am I totally off base? And how the hell am I supposed to deal with this? Because I'm really scared.

2016-11-20 16:39:04,5dysq6,23,1,"Here is my question--I am an aspiring eunuch who is also extremely strongly into both bodily feminization and facial feminization.

Basically, after I will get my orchiectomy (which is non-negotiable due to the fact that I need it for sterilization purposes; after all, neither vasectomy failure nor saying ""I trusted her"" is an acceptable excuse to avoid paying child support for 18+ years afterwards), I certainly want to *permanently* get rid of as much of my body hair and facial hair as possible (as well as to get forehead-focused feminization surgery on my face) once I will become able to afford it (for the record, my planned orchiectomy is certainly my first priority).

I've been in a gender questioning phase for a while and as much as I like the thought of being a girl, im just not sure how to know for sure whether or not I am transgendered. In the past year, a lot has changed. I've stopped identifying as a male and more as gender-queer and ive been slowly breaking the shackles of gender role constraints. I have changed my look and my out-look with the way I think of myself in relation to the world in terms of gender. I feel comfortable knowing im not a man, rather than feeling like I am a man that wishes they were something else. The thing is, I really want to be a girl, but I dont know if that is the same thing as being a girl. I read many stories from trans people where they say they always knew in some way or another. I can remember trying on my mom and sisters clothes at a young age and looking at myself in the mirror. Also, ive been bisexual since I was 14 and came out as such when I was 18, but when I had sex with men I always thought of myself as the woman, even asking them to imagine me as one. I also recall since I was around 15-16 thinking exclusively about being a girl anytime I fantasized about something sexual. Even when I would watch porn I would always imagine that I was the girl. 

Now this is the tricky part because even though there are signs I want to be trans for reasons other than sexual reasons, I do feel that since sexuality is somewhat of a factor in my decision to transition, does that mean im teetering on being a fetishist that is doing it for the wrong reasons?? Also, I would love to get on hrt but I dont think I would ever get gender reassignment surgery, and in fact I really adore the look of the MTF body, and I even love the idea of being a trans woman in a relationship with another trans woman. That would be an ideal situation in my mind, and not only for sexual reasons.

This spawns from the ""controversial"" joke Colin Jost made on SNL last weekend about transgender identities (link at bottom). I'd be happy to discuss the joke, but I'm more interested in discussing Tinder's new identity options specifically.

I was surprised to hear the number 37, and to learn that there are a number of additional identities beyond these. Seemed like a lot. So I did some reading.

Androgyne and androgynous. Androgyne is ""A person who *fits both physical characteristics* or feels like they are both a male and female."" So, even if they identify as male, but fit both physical characteristics, they could be considered androgyne? Meanwhile, androgynous is ""the combination of masculine and feminine characteristics."" They seem to be saying the same thing, and neither seem to be an identity, more of a physical description.

Gender nonconforming is ""people who do not follow other’s ideas or stereotypes about how they should look or act based on the female or male sex they were assigned at birth."" I don't understand how this is a gender identity. A male who is fine with acting in a manner generally considered by society to be feminine, or vice versa, is a gender identity? Don't you first have to identify as male or female, by definition, to fit this description? 

Genderqueer or non-binary. This one I fully understand..but it seems like it covers SO many bases. How can there be 50+ identities if one of them is basically ""does not give a fuck what other people think about gender identities."" I understand this is a very important one so please, inform me.

Two-spirit. ?? I don't understand this at all. I don't understand what it means or how it has anything to do with gender identity. Seems like any identity could describe themselves as two-spirit.

And on and on. To be clear, again, I'm not attacking anyone or calling this stupid, it just seems a lot of these identities are redundant or not gender identities at all but more behaviors/preferences/attitudes. I mean, is anyone here identifying as ""pangender""? Meaning, every single gender identity that exists, they associate with??

~~So I have a bit of an issue.~~
**My issue is now solved, read comments and last paragraph for details**


**A little background**

I’ve been publicly out as NB for about 7 months, and as I finally started to live as myself, I’ve also became confident enough to explore the possibility of a relationship. I’ve been doing a lot of playing around with what to disclose and how to build my profile, but so far nothing has been really working out. Most of the services I’ve used only support Male/Female genders but I’ve been explaining my identity in the first few lines of profile description or in the first few messages with whomever I’ve been talking to. As I present more feminine this days, and the relationship I’m after is more of a lesbian relationship than a straight one (and I’m not into masculine individuals or gay sex) that’s how I’ve been recently building my profile and declaring on sites which don’t provide more specific identities and orientations. But my presentation is all due to make-up, cloths and well lit pictures, I haven’t altered my body.


**The situation**

Recently I’ve started exchanging messages with a girl living just few hours away, and we are really getting along. She is bi (was in a straight relationship before, but is looking for a female partner now). I’ve explained to her very early I’m NB. But while most people would freak out at that point or ask me about my genitalia or at least which gender I was assigned at birth - she did not we’ve just move on with the conversation for the night. The next day I casually mentioned it again and explained what pronouns I use, and we had a bit of a chat about a mate of hers who is transgender (FtM), but still she didn’t ask me anything about my gender. But from the way she talks about me or our relationship so far, it feels like she thinks I was AFAB. I’ve added her as a friend on Facebook few days ago - it’s same account as I’ve used when I was still identifying as male and includes a lot of my old pictures so I thought if she does any snooping around the topic would come up, but it still hasn’t.


**My issue**

Now I feel torn, on one hand I feel like I’m falling in love with someone who likes me just the way I am - possibly the first person I’ve met who sees me as I am today and respects my identity, without caring about the past. On the other I feel that by not spelling it out to her I’m lying or at least deceiving her, and that makes me feel awful. I don’t even care if knowing the truth would mean we stop talking, but I don’t want her to fall in love with me thinking I’m a girl and break her heart when the topic does eventually come about… 


We’ve been messaging and sending casual pictures (we both agreed no nudity over the phone) but we really want to meet in person and plan on doing so in just a couple of weeks. And while I think that because she is bi, and because of how well we match each other mentally our relationship could work and develop further anyway, I also feel like I need to be clear with her before we meet or go any further.


How do I come out to her about my body before we meet? Or am I obsessing over nothing?

**Conclusion**
I was sitting on a bus trading cute messages with her when among the questions she came up with was ""Do you want kids?"", I've realised my oportunity to explain everything, so after a few more messages I've expalined that I lived as a male for about 20 years, and I'm pre-HRT and unsure about surgery. She was extreamly supportive, I mean no friend or familly member was as understanding and eager to learn as she is. I'm the first NB/Genderfluid person she knows, so the idea is still a bit confusing to her, but she is as eager to learn about is as I am to explain it so we are off to a good start :) And even I am still experimenting and trying to find my true identity.

2016-11-26 15:20:15,5ezvrh,13,31,"Hi, /r/genderqueer.

I need to talk about something. Sorry for the long post. I hope someone will read it anyway.

I'm 26 years old, AFAB, and I currently feel a bit...dejected. I guess I'm genderqueer in some way or other. I've never *really* felt like a woman. I remember walking to school when I was 13 or so, thinking *""why don't I feel like a girl?""*, and I remember feeling really happy when someone mistook me for a boy when I was 9. For *a long time* I thought all girls/women felt this way. I thought it was something that happened to everyone and that every girl/woman feels more masculine at times. About a year or so ago (late, I know) I realised that's not the case, which is when I started to really question things.

I don't have a specific label yet. I really don't know what I am. I sort of feel like a woman but at the same time I *really* don't (I'm okay with female pronouns though). However, I don't feel like a man either. Sometimes I think I feel like both a man and a woman and sometimes I think I feel like neither. I don't know. It's confusing. Anyway, I don't really feel like I *need* a specific label when it comes to my gender identity. I could just say I'm genderqueer if that makes me comfortable, right? Anyway, I do have a problem. A big problem.

I *hate* the way I look. I'm overweight, which contributes to the problem, but that's something I can fix by eating healthier and exercising more (I've already lost some weight so I'm working on it). Some things I can't fix, though, are my feminine body parts. Specifically my breasts. I hate them. Always have. Always will. Of course the universe had to gift me a large pair of breasts (D cup or so). I hate them so much and I would *gladly* get a breast reduction if that was possible. I mean, all I want is to look more androgynous but that's impossible with two alien lumps of fat permanently placed on my chest. The way I dress is fairly androgynous but I fail at looking the way I feel like I *should* look like because of my breasts. They ruin everything and right now I feel like I'll never be able to look the way I want to look, which makes me sad.

My hatred towards my breasts comes and goes. I mean, I *never ever* like them (never have, never will) but the intensity of the thoughts/feelings varies. I don't know if this qualifies as dysphoria (?) but I just wish I could do something about it. I've thought about binding but I have *no idea* where to start or how to deal with potential questions from other people if I suddenly have a flatter chest than usual. For some reason I feel like can't put myself in that position until I know *what* I am, but even if I had a specific label I worry that people wouldn't understand.

I don't know if I want much smaller breasts or if I want don't want any at all. Well, I definitely wish I had never developed breasts but I don't know if I want top surgery. Does that make sense? Anyway, I just *really wish* I was flat-chested.

For as long as I can think of, I've never felt like ""One of the guys."" I can hang out with guys at times, and feel pretty okay with it at times. What I don't feel okay with, however, is being seen as ""just one of the guys.""

In the same vein, however, I've never completely felt like ""One of the girls"" either. Like, I can be around girls and actually feel more chill and at ease, but feel a lot of unease as well.

It's like there's something missing when the bra isn't there that isn't when the bra is there. Even though I don't have boobs, even wearing something like a sports bra or an A or B cup bra seems to make the tops just fit better.

Another thing, I don't hate my penis. Granted I almost always am a sitter when I pee, and always have a pair of panties on, I don't hate the existence of my penis. It's more like I could do without it, but I don't see myself wanting to remove it right now.

As for my physical sex, I identify with the male body I was born with and for that reason am okay with male pronouns.

2016-11-30 04:02:52,5fni4n,3,11,"A couple of years ago, a distant cousin came out as trans MtF. I consider myself an ally of the LGBTQ* community and am trying to learn more. With that has come some questions about myself that I'm trying to understand. Generally speaking, I have considered myself a straight, white emotionally sensitive cis-male.

For years, I was always curious what it was like to wear women's underwear, pantyhose, bras, etc. I vaguely remember playing dress-up as a child, and as a teenager sneaking items from my sister's drawer on very rare occasions. When I was old enough to do so, I bought my own pair of thigh-highs and kept them hidden under my bed. I would wear them secretly at night under my jeans/socks. I would think about what it'd be like to wear other items, but I was always too afraid to buy them. I used to tuck myself between my legs to see what it would look like, and sometimes I would even use ""female"" techniques to touch myself and get off. At some point, I stopped thinking about those things for a while.

Then a couple of years ago, I found myself wanting to wear panties. I started wearing cotton panties because I liked how soft they felt compared to men's underwear, even if they didn't always support me properly. I also started wearing tights/pantyhose whenever it was cold outside. I liked how they made my legs feel.

About a week ago, my girlfriend was out of town and I found one of her bras laying around. In a moment of spontaneity, I tried it on as well as some of her other clothes. Her skinny jeans felt/looked amazing (and actually gave my nonexistant ass some shape). I liked how I looked with a shirt on over my ""new"" bra-induced curves. That was a pretty confusing moment for me. I'm not sure if it was because I felt sexy or what. I have since bought my own ""secret"" bra (36A) that I could wear under my regular clothes.

However, I have always considered myself as just a sensitive guy who is in touch with his anima or feminine side. That I'm ""emotionally feminine."" I find it hard to relate to machismo. Having said that, I used to practice self defense martial arts and I loved it - I felt very badass..empowered...""manly."" I sport a full beard. I used to have a ponytail, but I am balding and it didn't look so good so I shaved it all off. I like my ""manly appearance,"" and I don't hate my genitals or secondary sex traits. I generally identify as a male, who wants to be a better man (by moral/ethical standards) - but I also feel this feminine side begging to be acknowledged and related to by women (in the purest platonic sense).

I have noticed that at certain times of the year, I feel more ""in touch"" with my feminine side. Lately I have felt like crossdressing at home when nobody is around. I have wanted to go shopping for women's pants/jeans to see what fits and looks good. This time last year, I considered presenting myself online as a female version of myself (even came up with a name). I also did something similar when I was a teenager. 

So I'm mostly just confused. On the one hand, I never felt like I was assigned the wrong gender and I have no desire to rid myself of my facial/chest hair.
