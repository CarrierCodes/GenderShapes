Now I'm trying to figure out where I fit under the genderqueer umbrella, and I'm just not finding the right word.

I'm more than genderqueer, I know that much.

Non binary fits, but doesn't feel right. To me, the definition is sort of having gender, but fitting somewhere within the spectrum instead of right on one of the poles. 

Genderfluid is closer, but feels even less like me than nonbinary. How masculine/feminine I feel will generally change a bit, but it only changes by a few degrees on the gender spectrum.

Agender feels like it might be a closer fit, but I *think* I still feel I have a gender. I might be getting caught up in the idea of ""no gender."" I think I feel *something* akin to gender, but I don't know how much or what it is.

And all the other terms don't really fit me in any way. Or, at least, I don't feel any connection with them.

But through some experimentation I realised I was nonbinary, with more experimentation I figured I'm likely transfeminine as well so I started experimenting with HRT. Over the last year and a bit I've gone off and on HRT a number of times trying to find a place where I'm comfortable. Whenever I go off HRT I get uncomfortable with the resurgence of hair and apparently my moods are incredibly unstable and in general I'm not pleasant and I always end up wanting to go back on HRT. When I go off HRT I normally stay on a low dose of anti-androgens, so I'm not completely off, just not on E. Not sure if I could handle natural levels of T.

Then when I do go back on HRT because I'm not happy, I'm fine for a couple of months. The subtle feminization is a god send. The better skin the reduction in body hair, general softness of my bodily features. All fantastic. And then my breasts start coming in a bit and i freak the fuck out.

I also occasionally find myself missing how easy it was to get horny. But that's not too big a deal. Libido is supposed to come back later right?

I could just be having a masculine episode. But it just feels every time I make progress in one direction I desperately feel the need to pull back to a middle ground? I don't know anymore.

I definitely dont feel capable of stopping HRT all together. But I feel like the longer I stay on HRT the more distressed I'll be. Or maybe it'll pass? I'm just incredibly confused. I'm afraid to move forward and terrified of moving backward (back to natural T). 

This post likely doesn't do my feelings any justice, but i just needed to offload how i feel. Does anyone else feel this way? Has anyone felt this way? What did you end up doing?

But it just feels every time I make progress in one direction I desperately feel the need to pull back to a middle ground? I don't know anymore. I just feel stuck and trying to work out what I need is doing my head in. I'm on a relatively low dose of E too. \n\nI definitely dont feel capable of stopping HRT all together. But I feel like the longer I stay on HRT the more distressed I'll be. Or maybe it'll pass? I'm just incredibly confused. I'm afraid to move forward and terrified of moving backward (back to natural T). \n\nThis post likely doesn't do my feelings any justice, but i just needed to offload how i feel. Does anyone else feel this way? Has anyone felt this way? What did you end up doing?\n\nEdit: I mean I had to take a patch off last night because of a random allergic reaction.

I don't exactly consider myself genderqueer, but I'm posting here as I feel it's somewhat relevant as I like having an feminine side to myself. (Ideally I'd wear some clothing that suggest some degree of femininity and shave my body, but I'm rather uncomfortable doing so in public.)

Nearly everyone I talk to about the search for employment and the unfortunate reality that my hair will limit my choices agrees that I need to suck it up and cut it off.  Apparently, if I want long hair I have to establish myself first.  It reaches about 4 inches past my shoulders, isn't dyed, and I just recently had it trimmed to clean up any dead ends and make it look neater.  If I was a girl there'd be no questions asked regarding my hair as it isn't by any means abnormal.  But because I'm a guy, it's not seen as professional.

This situation is no doubt a common one (though the reasons for wanting long hair may differ from person to person), though I feel like my disposition to hair related issues makes things more complicated....
***
I'll try and keep the backstory story short, but I've always been opposed to haircuts.  My parents were always in charge of when I'd get my hair cut and how I'd get it cut, only loosening their grip late into high school to allow it to be slightly longer than the standard nerdy ""my mom picked this cut.""  When I finally expressed interest in growing it, I got the ever repeated talk about how it will make others judge me and how self expression is unimportant as it impacts other's judgments.  Eventually even the slightly longer hair style I wore in high school was revoked from me after my parents secretly scheduled me a haircut, gave me a 3 minutes heads up, and my mother screamed at me until I would submit and have her drive me there and tell them to cut it short.  I couldn't look in the mirror for a week without my feeling nauseous.  Any time someone brought up my hair I felt my stomach do a flip and skin felt like pins and needles.  After two years of college, and more forced haircuts, I finally broke down crying to my mom over the phone telling her I couldn't take another haircut.  This also led to me telling her that I'm interested in guys (I said I was bisexual, though over time I feel like I lean more towards being gay) as the conversation progressed as I was afraid she'd draw conclusions, and I thought I might as well get it out of the way.  Her reaction, while shocked was neither positive or negative, and she hopes it's just a phase though was never nasty to me about it.

The other element to this story is that a good deal of my sexual attraction...is based around hair.  I love guys with long hair, and want to be able to pull off the look myself.  Even when a guy doesn't have long hair I find myself staring whenever someone has a particularly pretty hairstyle.  Even though I prefer guys, girls can have memorizing hairstyles as well.  A particularly pretty hair braid, a colorful pixie cut, I love it all so much.  Having somewhat of a hair fetish makes my predicament even more painful to me, as I often wish I could put my hair in a fancy bun or a fishtail braid.

Last, and fair warning this is really weird.  But for as long as I can remember, I have had a haircutting fetish.  I'm sexually aroused by watching mostly women have their hair cut very short or completely shaved off.  There's no sexual content in these videos/images, just hair cutting.  Perhaps this was a development due to my complete lack of freedom regarding my own hair and ability to be feminine.  I can't really explain why I have such a fetish, but I just do.  It was essentially all I would view for sexual pleasure in my high school years, though over time I distanced myself from it as it was upsetting to me to be aroused by something like that.  Having my haircut short mimics the feelings of humiliation and punishment present in some of those videos and makes me feel like I'm being disgraced.  Hence the not being able to look in a mirror after my cuts.  It makes me feel sub-human.

I am in a class of people that experience *body dysmorphia* but not *gender dysphoria*. **Does this count as genderqueer?**

Any and all insight is appreciated. If I go this path my endo and I will be monitoring bone density and other things to make sure everything goes alright. That was actually the plan for the last six months but I jumped the gun and got on estrogen shortly after.

I needed new clothes anyway, but previously I only bought sort of gender neutral women\'s clothes.\n\nI guess as I try more things and get closer to androgynous/gender neutral, things will start getting weird for my SO, and I\'m not sure how to approach the issue. I\'d like to discuss it with him, but he\'s the kind of person who wouldn\'t say anything that would hurt me.\n\nHow do I talk to him about it? Or how do I continue moving forward?

I don't exactly feel uncomfortable with being seen as female, and actually prefer she/her pronouns, but calling myself a ""girl"" or a  ""woman"" feels... weird?

2016-08-10 20:41:20,4x4aju,14,23,"I'm AMAB, nonbinary, and mostly attracted to women and people exhibiting feminine qualities.  I haven't made any hormonal or surgical alterations to my body, and I probably won't, so my anatomy is male, although I don't have a very masculine build: I'm slender and have little muscle, and oddly, women's clothing often fits me better than men's. I suspect my hormone level may naturally be less masculine than typical for cis men, but I've never had this tested.

I have a great deal of shame associated with my sexuality, and I've recently decided I want to overcome this, but I'm not sure how.  I'm not sure why, but when I have tried to find resources online that are sex-positive and affirming of sexuality, they often don't resonate with me and don't speak to my experience.  I also have never heard any people, neither nonbinary people, women, nor men, explicitly voice dealing with the type of shame (or experience of sexuality) that I experience.  The closest I get is relating to accounts of women who feel intense shame associated with their sexuality, but these women don't deal with being perceived as male (and thus having their sexuality perceived as a threat) so they're missing what I see as one of the biggest pieces of my experience.

I think I have a combination of traits that makes me particularly vulnerable to internalized shame associated with sexuality.  These factors include:

* I am sensitive.  I feel emotions strongly, empathizing easily and intensely with others.  This can make me feel guilt and shame more strongly. Sometimes I can feel intensely bad in response to seeing that another person is upset in response to something that I did.
* Growing up, I picked up a lot of ""feminine"" aspects of socialization, such as wanting to please people, putting other people's needs ahead of my own, and avoiding ""hurting other people's feelings"".  I sometimes struggle with these things to the point of denying my basic needs.
* I am perceived as male by most people, and associated with this, my expressions of sexuality and romantic interest, and sometimes even my mere presence, can be perceived as a threat. From talking to men, I get the sense that this is harder for me to deal with than most men, because I'm so much more sensitive.
* I am most attracted to women significantly younger than me.  I'm 36 but am most attracted to women in the 20-28 age range and rarely attracted to women my own age.  This worsens my fear of being perceived as a predator or as ""creepy"", and contributes to internalized shame. I also find this tricky because it's one way in which my sexuality behaves more like a stereotypical straight male, and I worry that this pattern may feed into me being perceived as male or my sexuality being perceived as like straight male sexuality, in ways that lead to gross misunderstandings of me.
* I can sometimes be socially awkward.  Although I have always tested as not being on the autism spectrum I sometimes exhibit some asperger's-like patterns of social interaction, especially when feeling anxious, under stress, or feeling excluded or disconnected from people. In these mindsets, I struggle with disregarding social signals or awkwardly timing my comments. This worsens my fears about being perceived as ""creepy"", thus contributing to shame.
* I have never seen another example of someone expressing my sexuality the way it feels most natural for me to.  The closest examples I see are young lesbians who are ""girl crazy"" on Tumblr, or men who are labeled as ""lady's men"" or more derogatorily, as ""womanizers"".  Lesbian sexuality can sometimes be shamed in our society, and I wonder if the fact that I identify somewhat with lesbians has contributed to my shame. But also, I think seeing ways in which men who express warm and affectionate feelings, yet also romantic or sexual desires, towards multiple women, are labeled negatively (and their affection is often interpreted as insincere or manipulative, their intentions interpreted as being to try to ""get sex"" by deceiving women), has also contributed to my shame, because I identify somewhat with these men as well.
* The things I find physically attractive or unattractive can be different from cultural depictions of what is considered ""sexy"".  For example, I find things like high heels, bold makeup and red lipstick, lingerie, some tight clothing, or stereotypically ""sexy"" body language, all the imagery you hear discussed when people talk about the ""male gaze"" in movies and media, I find much of this to be an intense turnoff.  This may be because I associate these things with objectification of women, but I'm not exactly sure why, I just don't find it attractive.  I find myself intensely attracted to comfortable, casual looks, and what I see as relaxed, friendly, often androgynous body language.  When I've shown people what I find most attractive, even most sexually arousing, people have been pretty open about it seeming strongly disjoint from what most straight men find arousing.  People have described what I find sexually arousing, as ""wholesome"", a word that is sometimes associated with meaning non-sexual.
* For me, I cannot separate my sexuality from intense feelings of caring and a desire for emotional closeness and intimacy with a person.  To me, a physical attraction is a powerful source of these deeper desires.  I associate these feelings with sexuality, not just romance, so for me, feeling an ""instant"" connection or ""physical attraction"" with someone, even if I'm looking at something ""superficial"" like appreciating how their shorts fit and checking out their legs, manifests not as a desire for sex, but as a desire to get to know the person, to touch them affectionately, to say sweet and affirming things to them, and to be around them and be close to them, a feeling of gratitude towards them and a desire to help them or serve them.  This is one of the key things that I don't hear expressed often or even at all, and it's at the very heart of my experience of sexuality.  Instead I hear people, both women and men, talking about how they want to ""fuck"" someone, and talk about having sex just for the sensations or for the sake of it, without any emotional bond, or sexuality that centers around ""getting"" something. I not only do not think I'm capable of this and don't desire it, the very idea of it I find utterly repulsive and it gives me a skin-crawling sensation and makes me feel nauseous to even think of it.  The role I want sexuality to play in my life is as something that helps me to build strong bonds of friendship with people.  Yet the most visible alternative that I see to this ""free sex for the sake of sex"" is a puritanical view of sex that focuses on monogamy and traditional gender norms.  So I feel shame originating from the ""right wing culture"" which I've sometimes gravitated towards, in an attempt to get away from the ""cheap"" approach towards sex that I see in mainstream society, but I also feel shame associated with the disgust I feel towards casual sex and hookup culture, like I have this fear that I'm judging people for making choices different from mine and this somehow makes me a bad person.
* Although I often desire monogamous sexual relationships, I have a polyamorous orientation and I strongly desire an ability to express loving feelings towards multiple people that I feel attracted to. For me, feeling attracted to one person makes me feel more warm and caring towards people across the board, and these feelings spill over to other women, nonbinary people, and even to men.  I think polyamory is strongly taboo, usually entirely erased, in our culture, which I think is highly mononormative, and I think that my polyamorous desires are also a source of intense shame, as well as a source of specific problems in monogamous relationships.  I find it hard to find people who are open to polyamorous relationships of any sort, let alone the sort I want (which might be sexually monogamous but open to affectionate, loving feelings, and intimate friendships with multiple people), and I feel like my dating pool is already tiny enough, so I've spent a lot of time in monogamous relationships, and I've had repeated problems with my partners' jealousy and an inability to share my intimate thoughts about other people with my partner (this is *essential* to me in a relationship, I want a partner where sharing these feelings bring us together).
* The interaction between sexuality and friendship for me is blurry and ambiguous and I find this creates more trouble for me.  For me, attraction makes me desire friendship more strongly, and when I feel close to people emotionally it makes me feel more attracted to them (even with men, although I'm more attracted to women, the men I feel closest to, I also feel most attracted to). But I find women often want me to clearly identify whether I have romantic or sexual feelings for them, or friendly feelings, and to me, these things all go together in one big blurry continuum.  Whereas I want to navigate sexuality through expressing desires, asking questions, asserting boundaries, listening, and respecting other people's boundaries, I feel like most other people push me to categorize my desires into categories like ""dating"" and ""friendship"" and ""friends with benefits"" and stuff like this.  This doesn't work for me.  I find the act of labeling and categorizing my sexuality to be severely restricting, stifling, oppressive...and it seems to be used as a stand-in for direct communication and expression of boundaries.  I don't even know how to respect people's boundaries if they tell me something like ""I just think of you as a friend."" because to me, many of my expressions of sexual desire are things that are interpreted as being part of friendship, and someone telling me this does nothing to clarify exactly where their boundary lies.  This is another source of shame for me, both because it's a disconnect between me and others, and because it leads to situations in which I am misunderstood, and sometimes even directly criticized or shamed when I act in ways that other people feel uncomfortable with.

I think my shame originates from a combination of these factors.

Yeah!  I'm sorry this is a lot, it's so long I know, but it really helped to get this out, these are things I haven't ever expressed in one place before.

And I'd be really grateful if anyone has any insight, even if it's just into a small piece of this.",genderqueer,How can I affirm my sexuality and overcome internalized shame?,1470886880.0,"{'created_utc': 1470861680, 'id': '4x4aju', 'num_comments': 14, 'score': 23, 'selftext': 'I\'m AMAB, nonbinary, and mostly attracted to women and people exhibiting feminine qualities.  I haven\'t made any hormonal or surgical alterations to my body, and I probably won\'t, so my anatomy is male, although I don\'t have a very masculine build: I\'m slender and have little muscle, and oddly, women\'s clothing often fits me better than men\'s. I suspect my hormone level may naturally be less masculine than typical for cis men, but I\'ve never had this tested.\n\nI have a great deal of shame associated with my sexuality, and I\'ve recently decided I want to overcome this, but I\'m not sure how.  I\'m not sure why, but when I have tried to find resources online that are sex-positive and affirming of sexuality, they often don\'t resonate with me and don\'t speak to my experience.  I also have never heard any people, neither nonbinary people, women, nor men, explicitly voice dealing with the type of shame (or experience of sexuality) that I experience.  The closest I get is relating to accounts of women who feel intense shame associated with their sexuality, but these women don\'t deal with being perceived as male (and thus having their sexuality perceived as a threat) so they\'re missing what I see as one of the biggest pieces of my experience.\n\nI think I have a combination of traits that makes me particularly vulnerable to internalized shame associated with sexuality.  These factors include:\n\n* I am sensitive.  I feel emotions strongly, empathizing easily and intensely with others.  This can make me feel guilt and shame more strongly. Sometimes I can feel intensely bad in response to seeing that another person is upset in response to something that I did.\n* Growing up, I picked up a lot of ""feminine"" aspects of socialization, such as wanting to please people, putting other people\'s needs ahead of my own, and avoiding ""hurting other people\'s feelings"".  I sometimes struggle with these things to the point of denying my basic needs.\n* I am perceived as male by most people, and associated with this, my expressions of sexuality and romantic interest, and sometimes even my mere presence, can be perceived as a threat. From talking to men, I get the sense that this is harder for me to deal with than most men, because I\'m so much more sensitive.\n* I am most attracted to women significantly younger than me.  I\'m 36 but am most attracted to women in the 20-28 age range and rarely attracted to women my own age.  This worsens my fear of being perceived as a predator or as ""creepy"", and contributes to internalized shame. I also find this tricky because it\'s one way in which my sexuality behaves more like a stereotypical straight male, and I worry that this pattern may feed into me being perceived as male or my sexuality being perceived as like straight male sexuality, in ways that lead to gross misunderstandings of me.\n* I can sometimes be socially awkward.  Although I have always tested as not being on the autism spectrum I sometimes exhibit some asperger\'s-like patterns of social interaction, especially when feeling anxious, under stress, or feeling excluded or disconnected from people. In these mindsets, I struggle with disregarding social signals or awkwardly timing my comments. This worsens my fears about being perceived as ""creepy"", thus contributing to shame.\n* I have never seen another example of someone expressing my sexuality the way it feels most natural for me to.  The closest examples I see are young lesbians who are ""girl crazy"" on Tumblr, or men who are labeled as ""lady\'s men"" or more derogatorily, as ""womanizers"".  Lesbian sexuality can sometimes be shamed in our society, and I wonder if the fact that I identify somewhat with lesbians has contributed to my shame. But also, I think seeing ways in which men who express warm and affectionate feelings, yet also romantic or sexual desires, towards multiple women, are labeled negatively (and their affection is often interpreted as insincere or manipulative, their intentions interpreted as being to try to ""get sex"" by deceiving women), has also contributed to my shame, because I identify somewhat with these men as well.\n* The things I find physically attractive or unattractive can be different from cultural depictions of what is considered ""sexy"".  For example, I find things like high heels, bold makeup and red lipstick, lingerie, some tight clothing, or stereotypically ""sexy"" body language, all the imagery you hear discussed when people talk about the ""male gaze"" in movies and media, I find much of this to be an intense turnoff.  This may be because I associate these things with objectification of women, but I\'m not exactly sure why, I just don\'t find it attractive.  I find myself intensely attracted to comfortable, casual looks, and what I see as relaxed, friendly, often androgynous body language.  When I\'ve shown people what I find most attractive, even most sexually arousing, people have been pretty open about it seeming strongly disjoint from what most straight men find arousing.  People have described what I find sexually arousing, as ""wholesome"", a word that is sometimes associated with meaning non-sexual.\n* For me, I cannot separate my sexuality from intense feelings of caring and a desire for emotional closeness and intimacy with a person.  To me, a physical attraction is a powerful source of these deeper desires.  I associate these feelings with sexuality, not just romance, so for me, feeling an ""instant"" connection or ""physical attraction"" with someone, even if I\'m looking at something ""superficial"" like appreciating how their shorts fit and checking out their legs, manifests not as a desire for sex, but as a desire to get to know the person, to touch them affectionately, to say sweet and affirming things to them, and to be around them and be close to them, a feeling of gratitude towards them and a desire to help them or serve them.  This is one of the key things that I don\'t hear expressed often or even at all, and it\'s at the very heart of my experience of sexuality.  Instead I hear people, both women and men, talking about how they want to ""fuck"" someone, and talk about having sex just for the sensations or for the sake of it, without any emotional bond, or sexuality that centers around ""getting"" something.

2016-08-19 13:14:34,4yiugp,9,5,"So, I'm AFAB and would tentatively identify as bigender. I don't have any plans for HRT or GRS of any kind, but I do on some days identify as more masculine. My friends and SO know but my family doesn't. 

My dad is getting married at the beginning of next month to a very nice lady. She's been trying her best to get to know me ever since she and my dad started dating (I'm 22, they started dating about two years ago). And I've been mostly accepting of this.

However, there have been moments recently where her attempts to ""bond"" with me have sort of caused me to have dysphoric moments. Recently, she helped her daughter (who's about my age) pick out a dress. She talked about how she's really good at seeing what outfits work best on people, and she said that any girls coming to the wedding could ask for her help shopping. Then she turned to me and said ""you're next, kitkatkez"".

Everyone laughed. I laughed along. Inside I died. It's a funny thing, I've always had these feelings anytime someone drew attention to the fact that in their eyes I was 100% a girl, but now that I'm more out with my identity I feel it even more. I guess I always thought before that I was just an awkward tomboy afraid that I had to leave that stuff behind. Now I know it's something more.

That wasn't the end of it. My dad really wants me to talk to his fiancé more, so he kept talking to me and texting me about how I need a dress for the wedding and she's more than willing to help. I told him I don't like shopping with other people (true) and I also already have a dress (sorta true). I ended up buying a simple dress just to end the discussion. 

About a week ago I went to visit her and my dad. She kept asking me about my bangs, told me she could show me how to get them in one direction/easily trim them. At first I declined but she kept asking so I finally relented. As we were going upstairs I asked if my SO wanted to come with me and she said ""no, you go ahead and relax, this is girl time"". Needles in the brain. It wasn't a bad experience (I don't like people touching my hair but the advice she gave me was helpful) but that comment just kept going through my head. 

My dad during the dress episode sent me a thing about how ""all the girls are going to wear dresses and all the guys are going to wear dress shirts and slacks"" and there's still a burning part of me that wants to wear the second thing. But I worry that since they were so insistent on the dress thing that me doing that will be taken as me being difficult, and take away from their wedding, which is the absolute last thing I want to do.

It's just - stuff like this makes me think that I'm never going to get to be acknowledged the way I want to unless I transition completely. And I don't blame either of them, they don't know anything about this. But I don't know if I should tell them. My dad wouldn't cut off contact or anything, they wouldn't hate me but they wouldn't understand. My dad only now is starting to understand binary trans issues and he still misgenders people and says stuff like ""well if a woman wants to take hormones so she can be a man, why should anyone stop her, let her live her life."" Which I guess is better than hating trans people? Not by much? I love my dad but maaan. I just can't imagine explaining non binary to him at this point. Much less to his fiancé. 

I just feel a little sad because back when I was young and seen as a tomboy my dad always seemed to have my back on not liking feminine things. He stopped my bio mom from piercing my ears when I was a baby because he thought I should get to make that decision myself, and I decided I didn't want it. He gave me my early love of video games, a hobby that at the time was seen as even more of a boys club than now. My mom always hemmed and hawed about how he was just turning me into a boy because he never had a son, but he was letting me be me. Now I wish he'd say something to his fiancé about how maybe giving me girl time isn't the way for us to get to know each other. Instead I feel like he's putting it on me to bloom into my feminine flower already so we can be besties. But I know that's not what he means, it's more just me dealing with dysphoria blowing this all out of proportion. 

I guess, can anyone offer any words of advice in this situation?

As we were going upstairs I asked if my SO wanted to come with me and she said ""no, you go ahead and relax, this is girl time"". Needles in the brain. It wasn\'t a bad experience (I don\'t like people touching my hair but the advice she gave me was helpful) but that comment just kept going through my head. \n\nMy dad during the dress episode sent me a thing about how ""all the girls are going to wear dresses and all the guys are going to wear dress shirts and slacks"" and there\'s still a burning part of me that wants to wear the second thing. But I worry that since they were so insistent on the dress thing that me doing that will be taken as me being difficult, and take away from their wedding, which is the absolute last thing I want to do.\n\nIt\'s just - stuff like this makes me think that I\'m never going to get to be acknowledged the way I want to unless I transition completely. And I don\'t blame either of them, they don\'t know anything about this. But I don\'t know if I should tell them. My dad wouldn\'t cut off contact or anything, they wouldn\'t hate me but they wouldn\'t understand. My dad only now is starting to understand binary trans issues and he still misgenders people and says stuff like ""well if a woman wants to take hormones so she can be a man, why should anyone stop her, let her live her life."" Which I guess is better than hating trans people? Not by much? I love my dad but maaan. I just can\'t imagine explaining non binary to him at this point. Much less to his fiancé. \n\nI just feel a little sad because back when I was young and seen as a tomboy my dad always seemed to have my back on not liking feminine things. He stopped my bio mom from piercing my ears when I was a baby because he thought I should get to make that decision myself, and I decided I didn\'t want it. He gave me my early love of video games, a hobby that at the time was seen as even more of a boys club than now. My mom always hemmed and hawed about how he was just turning me into a boy because he never had a son, but he was letting me be me. Now I wish he\'d say something to his fiancé about how maybe giving me girl time isn\'t the way for us to get to know each other. Instead I feel like he\'s putting it on me to bloom into my feminine flower already so we can be besties. But I know that\'s not what he means, it\'s more just me dealing with dysphoria blowing this all out of proportion. \n\nI guess, can anyone offer any words of advice in this situation?

2016-08-19 17:34:06,4yk75x,17,17,"Hey guys. Let me preface this by saying I'm still a bit confused about my gender identity, as I constantly change my mind about what I'm feeling. I may be genderfluid but frankly I don't know if I'm fluid enough for that? Like what will typically happen is I will talk myself in a circle, leaving me even less sure about what I feel I am.

This being said I've found that I'm happiest when I feel like a girl, besides the dysphoria that sets in when I realize that well, I'm not one. I've thought for a while that I wish I was born a girl, but this also isn't consistent and I sometimes appreciate being a dude. I enjoy browsing Reddit, including some of the LGBT+ friendly subreddits, however when I had came upon people posting about being MTF I felt somewhat of a disconnect, i.e. I'm happy for them etc but that's not me. However recently I was browsing and it's like a switch flipped, I found myself fantasizing about being a girl and all that jazz. However I want to reiterate that it's a matter of wanting to be a girl, not necessarily feeling like one. This may be because I find many girls attractive (I'm pan but def more into girls then guys) or may be because I have a bit of a link for this type of thing (i.e. dressing up in girl clothes usually arouses me, although I also get somewhat of an emotional gratification from it). On the flip side whenever I've seen stuff about people transitioning from a female to male, I've picked up that I feel something along the lines of ""why would they want to do that? Who would want to be a guy, especially when you get to be born a girl?"" (With all due respect to those people that are FTM, do whatever makes you happy :))

To further complicate things I don't always feel this way, and there are varying shades to the feelings, i.e. when I feel like I want to be a girl that can be a guy sometimes.

Hello there, I'm AFAB and an androgyne. And oh joy; I'm going into high school! I'm looking forward to the academic advances and the freedom... but everything else, not so much. As if starting freshman year isn't hard enough, I have some gender-related concerns. I just want to make my high school years as enjoyable as I can. Any input from more experienced people is greatly appreciated.  

To begin, I’ll give context:  
* I’ve gradually transitioned to androgyny since the summer of last year, and I’ve never felt better.  
* Assuming my high school is the same as my middle school, changing rooms won’t have stalls and you will be expected to change in front of everyone else in the room.  
* I wear a binder to cope with my mild body dysphoria and to look more androgynous.  
* I have come out to my parents, and they are more or less accepting. They don’t understand, and feel weary or uncomfortable about it, but at least they try and don’t hate me for it. The way they talk to me tells me they’ll never be able to see me as anything other than a girl (for example, no matter how I explain it to my dad, he’ll say “...but you know you _are_ a girl, right?” and it’s extremely discouraging to say the least. My dad isn’t even as bad as my mom. The only other people in my family who know are a couple cousins.  
* If it is of any importance, I have a therapist who is in contact with school counselors and teachers.  
First of all, what should I do about changing for gym? My parents say going to a separate room, such as a bathroom, would make me an outcast and segregate me from others. They think people would wonder about why and such. On the contrary, I wear a binder. I guess I could wear a tank top over it when I change. As long as I convince myself a ""girl's"" locker room is just another way of saying anyone-whose-biological-sex-is-female's locker room, I feel alright with using it.  
Any suggestions on the whole parent situation? It could be worse but they keep hurting me and I can’t explain stuff to them in a way that they understand.  
If anything should pop up, how do you think I should handle social conflicts regarding my gender?  
 Should I use a different name? The name I was given at birth is very feminine, and was the 2nd most popular girl name of my year. It's not too bad of a name, but last year I picked out a neutral name for myself that I adore, and my friends call me by it. I'm debating whether I should go through the trouble of getting all the teachers to call me by my new name, or just stick with my old one and keep the new one for friends.  
The ultimate decision here is deciding to fully transition, which would make life harder but me happier; or to pass as an andro woman, which would make life easier but me uncomfortable if not unhappy.  

Any other advice for surviving high school in general would be greatly appreciated. Anything helps. Thanks!

TL;DR; Androgyne. I should completely transition, or save that until after high school to make things easier?

2016-08-21 03:16:54,4ysuvh,2,2,"Hi, I'm new to reddit. I'm also... kinda new...? to genderqueer stuff.

(Sorry in advance if I kind of jump around or don't make much sense... I'm trying to explain everything and not leave anything out. But, I'm not really sure how. My thoughts on the subject are just really scattered.)

Anyway, I'd like some advice from people who I'm sure have gone through very similar situations as me.

I'm AFAB, Pan/Ace, married to a cis male who is straight. I've questioned my gender before... a lot... off and on. I was never comfortable being called a woman, or lady, or anything like that. ""Girl"" is okay sometimes...? ""She"" is okay most of the time. Being called a wife is... also okay I guess.

Anyway, I've questioned it for a while, off and on. Sometimes I'll give up and just decide it's easier to ""stay"" a female. And just when I think I'm getting comfortable with it... I realize it feels all wrong and it makes me feel... not myself. And then I'll start questioning again. I've discussed this with my husband and, while he's really confused by the whole thing, he's pretty supportive. Even though he's straight.

Anyway I'm going through a period of questioning it again, and this time I really want to figure it out... I'm tired of this cycle. But I'm also so afraid of losing my husband. I love him so much, and I've never met anyone that I've felt so comfortable with and had such an easy time communicating with and I just love his company and the relationship that we have.... and he says he's okay with all of this. But... can a straight person really be with a genderqueer person?

Anyway... I still like feminine things. I still want to wear feminine things. But I don't feel like I am a woman, and I don't want to really be viewed as a woman, generally. I want to be viewed as somewhere in between.. or maybe as not having a gender at all?

And, I have size 32DD breasts. Which make me so uncomfortable in my own body. I mean, I'm pretty sure that I do want to have breasts. I just want them to be a lot smaller... less obvious. I don't want boob and cleavage hanging all over the place. I want them to be smaller, and more easily hidden. Like... an A or B cup?

And I just went through a long period of trying, again, to just be a woman. I thought maybe now that I'm married, I could get used to it. I bought some new/nicer clothes, and tried to just... live as a woman. And it was okay, at first. But then I started really getting uncomfortable with it again... I felt like I wasn't being true to myself. I mean, I did like some of the clothes. But, I don't like trying to see myself as a woman. I just... can't. It feels damaging to my mental health to do that, like I'm spending all of my time pretending.

But, I know I'm not a male either.

I guess... I need to do a lot more research on what genders there are, and try to find one that fits. Does anyone have any advice?

Also, like I asked above.... can straight people really be with someone who is not part of the gender binary... if they're supportive and still love the person? I mean, wouldn't that make them not straight... and then you'd be asking them to be something they're not? I don't want to live a lie... it makes me so uncomfortable.

And then I\'ll start questioning again. I\'ve discussed this with my husband and, while he\'s really confused by the whole thing, he\'s pretty supportive. Even though he\'s straight.\n\nAnyway I\'m going through a period of questioning it again, and this time I really want to figure it out... I\'m tired of this cycle. But I\'m also so afraid of losing my husband. I love him so much, and I\'ve never met anyone that I\'ve felt so comfortable with and had such an easy time communicating with and I just love his company and the relationship that we have.... and he says he\'s okay with all of this. But... can a straight person really be with a genderqueer person?\n\nAnyway... I still like feminine things. I still want to wear feminine things. But I don\'t feel like I am a woman, and I don\'t want to really be viewed as a woman, generally. I want to be viewed as somewhere in between.. or maybe as not having a gender at all?\n\nAnd, I have size 32DD breasts. Which make me so uncomfortable in my own body. I mean, I\'m pretty sure that I do want to have breasts. I just want them to be a lot smaller... less obvious. I don\'t want boob and cleavage hanging all over the place. I want them to be smaller, and more easily hidden. Like... an A or B cup?\n\nAnd I just went through a long period of trying, again, to just be a woman. I thought maybe now that I\'m married, I could get used to it. I bought some new/nicer clothes, and tried to just... live as a woman. And it was okay, at first. But then I started really getting uncomfortable with it again... I felt like I wasn\'t being true to myself. I mean, I did like some of the clothes. But, I don\'t like trying to see myself as a woman. I just... can\'t. It feels damaging to my mental health to do that, like I\'m spending all of my time pretending.\n\nBut, I know I\'m not a male either.\n\nI guess... I need to do a lot more research on what genders there are, and try to find one that fits. Does anyone have any advice?\n\nAlso, like I asked above.... can straight people really be with someone who is not part of the gender binary... if they\'re supportive and still love the person? I mean, wouldn\'t that make them not straight... and then you\'d be asking them to be something they\'re not? I don\'t want to live a lie... it makes me so uncomfortable. But, I don\'t want to lose what I have with my husband either... we worked so hard to even be able to be together in the first place. I can\'t imagine losing him.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Questioning?', 'created': 1471774614.0}"

It's been a year since I realized I was genderqueer and started transitioning. I settled on the label genderfluid because I had fluctuations. I spent a lot of my time femme, neither, and both, but I did spend some time as masc. There was a definite feeling inside, that told me what gender I was that day.

But somehow, that feeling has ebbed away from me. As far as I can tell, I'm approximately 60F20M. More femme than masc, but uncomfortable with being gendered either way. But I'm starting to be a little more comfortable with my deadname. It doesn't help that I'm back home from uni, and my parental units have used they/them pronouns twice in the week I've been here.

My dad tried to make me wear skirts all the time and forbid key from having short hair because he thought I wasn't girly enough.

As a teenager and young adult, I would sometimes refer to myself as ""butch"" and ""dikey"" (apologies if that is offensive to anyone here) even though I liked boys. I always said I wasn't feminine, that I felt like a guy, even though people told me I was ""very feminine."" (I'm short, squeaky, have apparently feminine features and am curvy although I am working to become leaner and more muscular.) My sister and best friend, however, separately told me I was ""really a gay man."" Always been extremely attracted to gay men.

I always felt different from other girls/women. When I was at a middle-school slumber party or bridal shower, I would think ""These girls are awesome, they're my friends, I like them, but I don't belong here."" 

If I imagined an alternate identity for a role-playing game or something, it was always either male or if it was female, I would hate the character.

Now I am almost 30, married to a wonderful man (who calls himself ""faggy"" -- again sorry for offensive language -- and is basically queer). Also have given birth to and breastfed a baby, who is now an awesome toddler. 

I have been trying so hard to be more feminine because I felt like my ""not like other girls"" feeling was just internalized misogyny. Like, we are so conditioned to think masculine == better. I took that gender test that was floating around and got ""casually masculine,"" but so did pretty much every other woman I know because all the feminine traits were like wimpy, manipulative, petty, etc. and all the masculine traits were assertive, competent, logical... So we live in a society that teaches ""women are stupid and have poor character."" Who wouldn't want to be masculine?

But I am always feeling this disconnect like I don't fit into my own body/identity/life and I'm not sure other women feel that. After my umpteenth breakdown over this, my husband said ""Honestly, it sounds like you're trans. Or at least you're definitely genderqueer."" (He is fine with this, since he likes guys too.)

I have tried so hard to expunge my internalized misogyny and feel good about being feminine and it hasn't worked. Where is the difference?

Sorry this is so long and rambly.

PS I recently got implants trying to feel more feminine and I was upset last night about not being able to bind anymore, but in some ways I like my fake tits because they are so very fake, and it makes me feel ironically less feminine.

2016-08-30 15:27:37,50bog6,8,12,"I'm a gay, cis man - who recently had a new neighbor move in next door. My boyfriend and I both do drag, and are fairly public with our neighbors about it. Turns out the son of the new neighbor is genderqueer; and seemed happy to have neighbors that understand gender isn't binary.

Both my boyfriend and myself have had a good amount of exposure to the transgender community through drag; and understand the struggles they face. However, ""genderqueer"" is an entirely new term to us - and we're both trying to wrap our heads around it.

What makes genderqueer different from androgynous?

To me it seems (and pardon me if this is offensive; please let me know as I'm uneducated in genderqueer issues) that if you were born female but identify as male (or vice versa) you would be 'transgender' or 'transsexual' (by varying definitions).

Are there people that fall into the 'born one gender but strictly want to be the other' category that identify as genderqueer? If yes, why would they identify as genderqueer when it seems a rather typical definition of transgender would be more accurate in describing their gender identity? (This is the case with my neighbor; he was born a 'she' but is refereed to as 'he'. He does not plan to take medication or surgically transition - but prefers to be referred to as 'him'. To me, that sounds like a typical 'transgender' gender identity; not 'genderqueer'.)

Further, if someone falls somewhere between male and female - wouldn't they have been historically identified as androgynous? Are there aspects that androgyny does not cover but genderqueer does? What is the reason we need to add sundry new labels to gender instead of just calling anything not binarily male or female ""androgynous""?

2016-08-31 00:44:29,50egqj,6,23,"Hey y'all, hoping your creativity can help me out here. My predicament (in NSFW detail) is this:

I'm female, cis, and mostly cool with this but with a seemingly increasing masculine streak. My girlfriend's trans and pre-op, trying to make the best of things while waiting for SRS. Sex has been getting pretty darn nice as we figure each other out, so that rocks. Now, we've greatly looked forward to my eventually penetrating her (she definitely wanted me to, and it grew on me as time went on), but due to unfortunate anal circumstances, we've just determined that this is probably off the table for quite a while.

I'm bummed (pardon me), and I'm not alone in that. As much as we enjoy what we can already do, and this is far from the end of the world or the relationship, I think it's going to suck to have to put these urges on hold for however many months remain, to have these anatomical limitations extend to the roles we take on. So I'm wondering, how can I give this seemingly masculine energy expression, and how can I help her still feel as feminine as she wants, given our current equipment and that new constraint?

I'm not looking to make penetration possible--I trust the owner of the ass when she says it's not feasible, and I'll stay just as hard in the nightstand drawer between now and go-time, however distant. I'm also fairly sure that, at least in my case, this question isn't *entirely* a matter of control--I'll take charge, sure, but doing so doesn't quite do the trick, doesn't satisfy the desire. More like, what acts performed on or with these body parts will align psychologically with how we want to relate to each other?
