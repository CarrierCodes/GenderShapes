Just need to have a bit of a feelings rant and wondering anyone feels similar. AMAB on/off HRT for a couple of years.

I'm back off estrogen briefly to consider my options. It's been 3 weeks and I'm back to thinking about going back on them.

I think what I've been having problems with is that while for the most part having a feminine body would be fantastic (if I could hit a button that transformed me into what I would be if I'd been born female, I would), the thought of being visibly trans and nonbinary has been my roadblock. Yay internalised transphobia :'(

As my presentation changes toward feminine a lot of my identity and certain aspects remain masculine. Particularly my general demeanor, voice and singing voice. I guess I just feel the societal pressure of what I 'should' be doing to meet expectations of the binary and not stand out and it goes against the way I feel. And that is causing issues.

And I know I shouldn't care about societal expectations but they are a big part of our conditioning and as someone who has self esteem issues and is always looking for validation I've often clung to them. It also doesn't help that I'm quite the looker when doing the usual expected masculine presentation. And that also comes with lots of privileges. 

And it sort of comes down to whether having a feminine body is worth the societal issues Ill have to deal with. And I guess I know deep down it is... I'm just having trouble committing to that path for myself.

What stood out for me recently regarding my feelings was when I went to the endo to discuss other treatments like SERMs, to get the feminisation but not breast growth. I guess the not wanting breast growth is partly because once I have them I can't as easily hide in man mode. And partly because there are times when I do enjoy a masculine appearance and they would make that difficult. 

But when he was talking about not getting the feminisation on them (SERMs) that I would get on E and the fact the growth I have now would probably revert a bit, I internally freaked out. 

In the end he printed me a script I've yet to use. At the moment I'm just on blockers. And I'm mentally exhausted from this inner conflict. 

Anyway thanks for reading.

2016-09-08 17:17:48,51serk,0,5,"I'm 23 years old, agender/genderqueer, and in a long-term relationship with a pansexual transwoman that didn't know she was trans when I met her. Since my girlfriend moved in with me last year, she's been able to fully experiment with her gender identity for the first time, and she told me about a month ago that she feels that she strictly identifies as female now.

The relationship is interesting, to say the least, because she is pansexual but tends to be more attracted to the feminine region of the gender spectrum. Meanwhile, I currently present a bit heavier on the andro side of androgyny, and am pretty exclusively attracted to the masculine region of the gender spectrum. Had I met my girlfriend after she had started to transition, I'm not sure if I would've been interested in pursuing a sexual/romantic relationship with her. This does have me question whether or not our relationship has an expiration date, because I have absolutely no intention of holding my girlfriend back from transitioning however fully she would like to (which currently at least includes hormone treatment). I have no doubt that I love her and care about her deeply, but I wonder if the sexual component of that will change further into my girlfriend's transition. For the time being, I'm just keeping an open mind and doing my best to support her.

For what it's worth, my girlfriend and I recently had a conversation about our respective genders, and I've had lingering doubts about my ability to impress my gender identity upon others. After my girlfriend affirmed what had already mostly been confirmed, she told me (without any real prompting) that she didn't really see me as having any particular gender (although I'm AMAB). To get that kind of acknowledgement from my partner was very refreshing, and it renewed my interest in developing my own identity further. So here I am!

Just to clarify, when I identified myself as ""agender/genderqueer"" at the start of my post, I didn't mean to imply that I think the two identities are interchangeable. If I had to use one term to more accurately describe myself, I would honestly call myself a ""gender troll"". I really get a kick out of messing with people's preconceived notions about gender, and while I don't think I have any particularly strong internal sense of gender (hence the ""agender"" half of my previous label), I do like to dip my toes into the theater of gender and play with it socially (hence the ""genderqueer"" part). Having written that out now, I do worry about how it relates to the old ""deceptive transwoman"" trope, because I certainly don't have any desire to perpetuate gross crap like that.

If anything, I'm very confident in the ""agendered"" aspect of my personality, but I feel like I want to do more with my presentation. On that front, I think I actually experience something along the lines of gender dysphoria in that I'm very sensitive about some of my more masculine features, since they're incongruous with how I want to be seen by others. I can at least count myself grateful that I never need to worry about changing my given name, since it's both gender neutral and very inconspicuous (Taylor).

I still wish that I could do things like paint my nails or wear feminine earrings and not be judged for it.\n\nIn regards to ""dysphoria,"" I wouldn\'t say I\'m dysphoric exactly. I have a preference, and that preference would be to have a vagina. If possible, I\'d swap out my dick for a vagina and internal plumbing. It\'s not like I dislike my dick, I\'d just prefer the other option. Despite this, I\'m comfortable with the rest of my  male body (except for issues surrounding weight). Sometimes I wish I\'d been born female just so I could transition to my ""ideal"" body.\n\nSo, reddit, help me out?

For me, I've tried having a more masculine mask in life. I can be interested enough in sports to have a decent time at a Super Bowl party or hanging out with friends watching a baseball game or a football game or something. I just don't feel like, when it comes to what most people think of when they think ""man"" I fit into that. I've tried to be more like that, and it makes unhappy.

Now, as for a feminine mask, I have certain physical attributes that make a feminine presentation a little hard to obtain. My hairline is very male. My face is kinda male. My body, despite some feminine leanings, is that of a guy's. I've made peace with this though.

What I talk about when I say I like the idea of having a feminine mask, it isn't the same as wanting to be a woman. Yes, there are times I want to be a woman, but they aren't as frequent as the times I feel like neither a man or a woman. I do like the flexibility aspect, however.

Not saying they don't catch crap, but women can typically express greater fluidity in their appearance and still be seen as ""normal women."" This is what I talk about when I say I have a more feminine identity, since I feel like femininity has a greater range of expression potential than masculinity, as femininity can borrow from masculinity a lot easier than the other way around.

I am finally getting to a point where I am feeling like I need to express myself more. It isn't a matter of necessarily ""finding myself,"" but that's a part of it. No, this is me saying ""I have always liked this stuff, I am just now allowing myself to actually express a like of it.""

Sorry if this question is redundant and has been asked before but I'm really confused. Also, I know some people will say I shouldn't try so hard to find a label for myself but it's honestly nice knowing I fit into a category or group. 

Super short synopsis of myself (I was born male)... 

I definitely have some female characteristics to my personality along with male characteristics plus I have always worked out a lot so I'm fairly muscular. I have been crossdressing since I was young - it's a sexual turn on, it's comforting, and as of recently I feel like it allows me to express myself. I'm currently hung up on how to integrate my female side into everyday life.

2016-09-21 19:13:31,53uv60,2,7,"I posted this to r/ftm, but I figured I'd post it here too, because I'm still figuring myself out right now, and genderqueer is the best description I can think of of myself in this moment. Its a long post (I like for people to know 100% and it feels nice to get it out) so bear with me! Apologies if it's super incoherent. It's a lot of backstory.

So my family lives in the USA but I got to uni in the UK. This whole summer I've been stressing about coming out (as FTM), because this year at uni I'm going to meet a whole new group of people, (I did a foundation year last year, and only a few people know me from then) and wanted to have my shit together NOW, so I could go through the rest of my time at uni with people just knowing me as a guy. Well, the thing is, I could never find a time to come out, and I waited till 2 days before I left again for uni and had a horrible panic attack afterwards. I came out with a letter (which I previously posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/4zh1je/coming_out_letter_to_my_family_critiques_highly/) ) Really, it's a mistake on my part for waiting so long and not having time to process and socially transition. Also, its because I don’t like change, and somehow I have it in my head that being out as trans is gonna change everything. And of course when I have a panic attack, I get what my sister and I call an ‘anxiety hangover’ which is general anxiety, lots of trouble eating, and a high heart rate for like a week after. The day after I came out (to just my mum and sister at this point) I emailed the registrar at my uni telling about the name change and stuff and she was super cool about it. Then the next day, in my crazy anxious state, reading the email suddenly made it so fucking real that I had to email her back and say “you know what change it back to my legal name”. On the subject of my anxiety and such, it's been a few weeks and I feel pretty much back to normal (besides the usual shit with leaving home and such)

After coming out to my mum and sister they seemed pretty ambivalent to it. My mum later showed my dad the letter I wrote and he has said NOTHING about it. Really the whole trans thing was mentioned 0 times the past few weeks and no one even tried with pronouns and names. I don't really care, because I understand that we were all just focused on the anxiety at the time. Well, my issue now is that I kinda panicked on my first day back at uni, and didn't come out to any of the people who knew me last year, and have been going by my birth name and female pronouns. It's awkward because some people who I haven't introduced myself to have been reading me as male, and then all the people who know me are like ""uhhhhhh she's a girl"". Gahhhhhh this is just such a stressful time, because on top of it all, I don't even know if I want to come out as FTM. That's why I'm posting this here, because I've flipped back and forth between identifying as genderqueer and FTM. Part of my issue with identifying as genderqueer is that society just isn't set up for non-binary genders and I don't want to deal with all that ""are you a boy or girl"" kinda stuff. I clearly couldn't handle coming out a few weeks ago, and idk if I ever will be able to. I do realise that I went about it the wrong way, trying to just flip a switch and socially transition in like, 3 days.

Its a long post (I like for people to know 100% and it feels nice to get it out) so bear with me! Apologies if it\'s super incoherent. It\'s a lot of backstory.\n\nSo my family lives in the USA but I got to uni in the UK. This whole summer I\'ve been stressing about coming out (as FTM), because this year at uni I\'m going to meet a whole new group of people, (I did a foundation year last year, and only a few people know me from then) and wanted to have my shit together NOW, so I could go through the rest of my time at uni with people just knowing me as a guy. Well, the thing is, I could never find a time to come out, and I waited till 2 days before I left again for uni and had a horrible panic attack afterwards. I came out with a letter (which I previously posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/4zh1je/coming_out_letter_to_my_family_critiques_highly/) ) Really, it\'s a mistake on my part for waiting so long and not having time to process and socially transition. Also, its because I don’t like change, and somehow I have it in my head that being out as trans is gonna change everything. And of course when I have a panic attack, I get what my sister and I call an ‘anxiety hangover’ which is general anxiety, lots of trouble eating, and a high heart rate for like a week after. The day after I came out (to just my mum and sister at this point) I emailed the registrar at my uni telling about the name change and stuff and she was super cool about it. Then the next day, in my crazy anxious state, reading the email suddenly made it so fucking real that I had to email her back and say “you know what change it back to my legal name”. On the subject of my anxiety and such, it\'s been a few weeks and I feel pretty much back to normal (besides the usual shit with leaving home and such)\n\nAfter coming out to my mum and sister they seemed pretty ambivalent to it. My mum later showed my dad the letter I wrote and he has said NOTHING about it. Really the whole trans thing was mentioned 0 times the past few weeks and no one even tried with pronouns and names. I don\'t really care, because I understand that we were all just focused on the anxiety at the time. Well, my issue now is that I kinda panicked on my first day back at uni, and didn\'t come out to any of the people who knew me last year, and have been going by my birth name and female pronouns. It\'s awkward because some people who I haven\'t introduced myself to have been reading me as male, and then all the people who know me are like ""uhhhhhh she\'s a girl"". Gahhhhhh this is just such a stressful time, because on top of it all, I don\'t even know if I want to come out as FTM. That\'s why I\'m posting this here, because I\'ve flipped back and forth between identifying as genderqueer and FTM. Part of my issue with identifying as genderqueer is that society just isn\'t set up for non-binary genders and I don\'t want to deal with all that ""are you a boy or girl"" kinda stuff. I clearly couldn\'t handle coming out a few weeks ago, and idk if I ever will be able to. I do realise that I went about it the wrong way, trying to just flip a switch and socially transition in like, 3 days.\n\nSorry for all that, but I guess what I\'m really asking in this thread is, has anyone else got weird post coming out anxiety?

2016-09-22 07:07:56,53xtbx,16,16,"Hey all, this is my first time posting to this sub. I will preface this by saying this sub has really helped me discover and feel more confident in starting low dose T. 

Before, I didn't know that NB and genderqueer people like me did this sort of transition. I have always felt more masculine and can even remember crying when I started to grow breasts because I didn't want them. However, I do not identify as a man, and would not like to. I do wish to appear and even sound a little more masculine. 

I have been talking with my gf about starting T for a while now, and she is 100% supportive and even encouraged me to find a community to be apart of so I wouldn't feel so alone. She loves me a lot and tries her best to understand. However, she admitted she was afraid that I would stop being attracted to her and become attracted to men, like her FTM friend. She says her friend had girlfriends that he loved and lived with but then just started being into other guys. 

I told her I don't see this happening. I told her I straight up only have a desire for her. I have never been interested in guys. She then mentioned the fact that I watch gay porn...and not really straight porn. I told her that I've done that from a very young age and figured out later in life that I watched it out of envy. I wanted to look like them...not to mention I can barely stomach straight porn. But she knew that. I admitted I do watch tolerable straight porn at times. I also told her that a lot of times when I get off I think about her or us together.

Another concern she has is that I will be less soft and understanding with her. I told her I don't see this happening either. 

I love her with all my heart and no other woman compares. I'd appreciate some input from any NB and genderqueers.

I'm not sure where to start or how to start, so I'm just gonna... start. I recently came out as agender/genderfluid. I’ve experienced gender dysphoria and dysmorphia my entire life, ever since I was a child. I didn’t hate being a girl, not necessarily—but I hated my girl body, and I knew that my body was one that did not belong to me. I wanted to ""hack my breasts off"" from age 8 until I was about 14, and afterward, until I was 19 and learned about bigender/agender, I thought I was transgendered or just a very, very confused lesbian.


I've been talking with people about this lately, but not in a way where I feel like I can fully express myself and say everything want to... so. I really hope someone, somewhere will hear me out.


I am genderqueer, I'm pretty sure. I'm certainly sure. Actually, I'm positive, but I'm having a hard time coming to terms with it because of all the negativity surrounding it and I'm not sure how to cope.


I want top surgery, I want to dress like a man—or in all actuality, ambiguously, really, most of the time—and I want to have the suavity and mannerisms of a man. But I want to be pretty, too. Somedays I want to be soft and delicate. I want to do my makeup, occasionally treat myself to heels and dresses, grow out my hair, and all the things I’ve always done. I want to be femme fatale, but I want to be prince charming. But people just don’t get it. “Why do you want to go through all the trouble of trying to be a boy, but only if it’s sometimes?”

Cause that’s just how it is for me. I don’t know, I can’t explain it, and I’m not sure if I ever *will* be able to explain it. 

And honestly, that might be the most frustrating part. 

Sometimes I wonder if it's because societally, it's considered ""unacceptable"" for men to wear makeup, grow their hair, and to be interested in fashion that's not traditionally masculine. I wonder if men could dress and do whatever they want without any negative repercussions, if I'd feel differently about this, I'm not sure. But I'm often caught thinking to myself, ""how could any part of me want to be a guy, what kind of guy likes fashion and make-up?""

(I know that answer is many; I know plenty. but you know. That darn society. It tells me that if I like those things, I must be a girl, and a girl I must remain.)

When I was 16 and thought that I only had two choices and that gender was just black and white, I asked my brother (who was, really, my only family at the time) what he would do if I wanted to be a boy. He told me he would disown me; he asked God for a sister, not a brother, and I never said another word about it again until six months ago—I'm 23 now.

And six months ago, I tried to explain to my mom what gender fluidity was. Surprisingly, she claimed that she knew I was ""fluid between genders"", but she's still not comfortable with it, not completely, but in a way, I’m fine with it because she doesn’t really berate me for it either. She’s just confused. But whenever I try to bring it up—“hey mom, my therapist found some resources for me, she might’ve found a surgeon I can consult,” she just tries to use the counterargument that no man would ever love a woman without breasts. I should ""just get a reduction"", because God Forbid™.

I haven’t told my friends because they think it’s a joke—a tumblr joke, a made up thing that doesn't actually exist. Just an introductory adjective that ""special snowflakes"" use to make themselves seem interesting. I haven't told my boyfriend because he thinks the same way my friends do, and I didn't know that he was incredibly transphobic until recently. We've been together for two years, and I'm hopelessly in love. So I sacrifice that, or my true, internal happiness, and either way I lose.

To sum it up, a tl;dr:

I hate this. I hate feeling like I have to choose one or the other. I want to be neither or both, and when I say to someone that I want to be neither or both, I hate feeling like they don’t take me seriously or that this is just some kind of big joke or that I’m going through a phase even though I’m 23 years old and have felt this way for nearly 10 years. I don't fit in this body, I never have and I never will, and I've spent so long trying to claw my way out of it that I'm tired. I just want to live my life the way I've always envisioned it, happy. That's it, that's all.

I should ""just get a reduction"", because God Forbid™.\n\nI haven’t told my friends because they think it’s a joke—a tumblr joke, a made up thing that doesn\'t actually exist.

I hate feeling like I have to choose one or the other. I want to be neither or both, and when I say to someone that I want to be neither or both, I hate feeling like they don’t take me seriously or that this is just some kind of big joke or that I’m going through a phase even though I’m 23 years old and have felt this way for nearly 10 years. I don\'t fit in this body, I never have and I never will, and I\'ve spent so long trying to claw my way out of it that I\'m tired.

2016-09-24 04:00:59,548mpi,6,6,"Hey all.

Long story short, I'm AFAB, and I've known something has been up with my gender since I was about 12 (I'm about to turn 20). I've always hated having breasts, and wearing womens clothes makes me feel like I'm cross-dressing.

That being said, I don't identify as 100% male, either. In fact, I think my problem is that I don't like strangers looking at me and immediately thinking ""boy"" or ""girl"", I just want them to think ""person"". Obviously, most of society doesn't work that way, which means that i'll just have to deal with it.

As i've had these feelings for about 8 years now, over the past few months I've begun to consider going on T. I would like a deeper voice, and facial hair, everything else is kind of ""whatever"". 

I've never been a ""girly-girl"", but I see women with light makeup, and I think ""wow! I wish I could look like that, if only I were less masculine."" Ex: [Missy Higgins](http://imgur.com/a/UfQzH) The thing is...there's nothing thats really stopping me from looking like that. But every time I wear women's clothes or makeup, I feel like I'm crossdressing, I just get a very weird sensation that something is wrong. 

On the other hand, I see guys like [Matthew Gray Gubler](http://imgur.com/a/qCg02) and I'm like YES. THATS WHAT I WANT. He's not super masc, which is what I envision myself to be like, if I ever went on T.

Does it sound like I'm just trying to mask my desire to go on T by saying that I want to be more feminine (something that I've NEVER been comfortable with)? Is that internalized transphobia? If so, any tips on getting over it?

I don't have many friends, but I've been out to all of them for a while, including my girlfriend.

My mom and sister know, and are really respectful.

2016-09-28 09:39:13,54vk43,7,23,"C/w slurs, transphobia (but it gets better!)

So I'm presently visiting some friends in Vegas, and because nobody else knows me for 400 miles in any direction, I decided to spend the trip presenting more feminine. It has been an amazing, mostly-positive few days, but I got off to a rough start.

The first day, I was in a long denim skirt and women's v-neck, but otherwise wasn't trying to ""pass"" or anything. At the restaurant where we met for lunch, some dudes who walked in to the restroom behind me decided to make really loud comments about how ""I guess that tr***y has to stop pretending some time"" and the like. It was the first time that particular slur was applied to me, and the first time I really felt unsafe presenting more feminine. I hid in the stall until they left. Fortunately this all happened after we paid. I don't know why I let them get to me, but I did, and I almost gave up on the whole project and stuck to men's clothing for the rest of the trip.

Then the next day I said ""fuck those assholes"" and went out in public in a dress for the first time. My wife and I ate lunch, went shopping, did some sightseeing, and nobody said a thing, although I definitely turned some heads. It was awesome and affirming and I am so glad that I didn't let a few assholes keep me from expressing myself.

It has been an amazing, mostly-positive few days, but I got off to a rough start.\n\nThe first day, I was in a long denim skirt and women\'s v-neck, but otherwise wasn\'t trying to ""pass"" or anything. At the restaurant where we met for lunch, some dudes who walked in to the restroom behind me decided to make really loud comments about how ""I guess that tr***y has to stop pretending some time"" and the like. It was the first time that particular slur was applied to me, and the first time I really felt unsafe presenting more feminine. I hid in the stall until they left. Fortunately this all happened after we paid. I don\'t know why I let them get to me, but I did, and I almost gave up on the whole project and stuck to men\'s clothing for the rest of the trip.\n\nThen the next day I said ""fuck those assholes"" and went out in public in a dress for the first time. My wife and I ate lunch, went shopping, did some sightseeing, and nobody said a thing, although I definitely turned some heads.

I have recently started learning about genderqueer identities and wonder if this applies to me. This hasn't been a major issue in my life, but I have never actually felt like a 'man.' In terms of the traditional idea of what it means to be a man or male, I'm not really sure what that feels like, or what it should feel like. Whenever I heard this kind of language coming up from people or friends, it just made me very uncomfortable and didn't really connect. I never thought about this in terms of 'gender' because this kind of language makes plenty of other nonathletic or skinny kids uncomfortable. But in terms of how it might apply to a gender identity, or how being a man might feel, I just can't even grasp that as a concept, it feels foreign to me. I'm not sure if that's normal, or if it's a sign that I'm genderqueer.
The other thing is that I also don't like being the man in any sort of relationship, although I'm straight, I prefer my partner to be the more masculine one. This is especially confusing because I'm attracted to femininity but feel a need a more masculine partner. Romantically, I guess, I'd prefer to be treated more as the feminine one in a relationship. I don't really have natural effeminate characteristics, but in some ways I feel much more effeminate than masculine, and would almost prefer to have more effeminate characteristics than I do. My gender hasn't really been something I've thought about much until recently, it has never directly conflicted with my life in a way that I was conscious of until possibly now. My question: does it make sense to identify as male, but not really as a man? I'm not sure if these feelings that I'm describing actually make me a genderqueer individual, or if I'm just sounding like a confused person. My apologies if this comes across as rude. I have done a lot of reading, and I'm just not sure. Although the idea is liberating in a way I hadn't really felt before.

I don't know, I don't think it's as simple for me as identifying as female anymore, when there are so many aspects of me that don't feel so, and some days I wish I could just present in a dudely way without being uncomfortable.

I'm always going to be more comfortable dressing in a more androgynous manner, as overt femininity or masculinity make me feel weird.
