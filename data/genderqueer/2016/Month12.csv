2016-12-06 05:37:31,5gr6r8,5,6,"I was advised by my SO recently to reach out to networks and communities online, and here. But I don't even know where to begin. 

I'm in a steady, wonderful relationship with a bisexual male right now, and his coming out to me was this beautiful sigh of relief almost two years ago that allowed me to more comfortably explore my identity. 

I had struggled for years with a feeling that I could only subscribe to the idea that putting on lipstick some days made me feel like I was putting on drag. I would look the same as the day before, sometimes down to my work uniform. But something about how I saw myself made me feel noticeably different, almost incorrect. Out of place. Four years ago, for example, I had a rush of excitement about cutting off my hair if only so that I could look ambiguous and non specific. 

I don't remember how the pieces fell together. Maybe I searched for flags or pronouns or something popped up on tumblr. But I found androgyny as a concept, and Androgyne as a term of identity. So, that's where things started to get easier. 

My wardrobe attempts to be neutral. Collared shirts and sweatshirts as well as dresses and knee highs. I want to reach a point of physical androgyny where I can mix these things up. I've played with makeup, how to work with my face and contouring and things like that to present one way or the other. But I still feel stuck, non-malleable. Feminine AF. 

Several months ago, I went to a house party, got belligerently drunk, and confessed my affections to a straight boy I had known for a while. When he rejected me (politely), I cried in the middle of this house party about how ""boys don't like girls like me."" He later tried to tell me that he was at a point in his life where was questioning his sexuality, and thought he might be bisexual, so it wasn't the time for him to really invest in anyone emotionally. Parts of me wanted to scream out that I was exactly what he needed, I was the perfect solution! I was every bisexuals dream mate, I'd pull on a strap on or be a French maid or whatever they want sexually because I'm all of that rolled up into one, right? That's how this works, right?

At the end of the day, I'm stuck in this place where I still get swipes on tinder from straight boys and bisexual girls. But there's not a broad trans or queer community around here, and there's still that disgusting feeling of knowing that I'm not sure a gay male will ever look at me and want anything to do with me, or that a lesbian into femmes might be turned off by what I'm into or who I am or how I present myself sometimes. I have so many days where I want to tell people I'm a boy but it will cause problems the next day when I'm not or I'm not sure. 

I want to text that guy from the party sometimes to ask him how he'd feel if I could be a boy for him, as long as sometimes I could be a girl, too. Is that okay? 

How do you work through this? How do you feel comfortable in such an ever changing environment? Am I new-age tumblr-in-action garbage?

I'd love to hear from folks who've been through this what I should expect tomorrow, especially if anyone has specific experience with Kaiser. (They're big enough, right?) Of particular concern is the fact that I'm non-binary: should I tell them that or pretend to be a trans girl?

I am thinking of trying to get HRT through the NHS, anti-androgens and a low dose of eostrogen, but hear it is difficult enough to get treatment as a transgender individual, and for a non-binary it would be near impossible. With this in mind I plan to angle as if I wish to transition completely to a binary female and eventually get gender reassignment surgery (which I definitely do not want) Changing my name via deedpoll (even though it is already gender neutral), showing up to my gp and later GIC wearing a dress, the whole shebang. Then, when they ask if I want to increase my estrogen dose a few weeks/months into the treatment I will say I am happy with how things are going and I don't need a higher dose.

I am worried, however, that if I develop further male secondary sexual characteristics before I can start treatment I might have to resort to self-medicating, which I hear is really quite dangerous.

Is anybody in a similar situation/ has been in a similar situation to me that could offer advice? Does this seem like the right way to go about doing things?

2016-12-09 22:04:40,5hgn83,10,19,"Hey y'all, this is my first post here, but I could really use some perspective from the GQ community..

I am 32, and have lived a closeted life in the Southern US my entire life. About six months ago I came out as trans and began HRT. I know this is the right path for me, and I haven't had any serious misgivings about it since I came out. I filed to have my name and gender changed, got a new wardrobe, and finally don't see a stranger when I look at myself in the mirror. All of these things feel so incredibly validating, however, I am still of a somewhat divided mind about my public presentation. 

I know a lot of trans folks struggle with the issue of passing in public, and I get that there is a whole range of reasons for this, both personal and social. The feeling of vulnerability or risk associated with being publicly identified as trans (or having any non traditional gender identity) is definitely real, especially in the southern US. 

But I also feel this personal slippery slope. Like, when I was pretending to be a boy growing up, I was HYPER focused on my appearance and presentation. I got teased for everything from the way I stood, sat, talked, etc. for being ""a sissy"".. this led me to develop all of these artificial personality traits and affectations that isolated me from the people around me. I was afraid to let them see the real me, because they would know right away what I was. I even shaved my head for nearly 10 years because my long, wavy hair would give me away, so to speak. 

So now I guess I am struggling a bit with my desire to pass as female. Is this just me, once again, seeking to conform to the expectations I feel around me? To present in a way that is ""safe"" and ""acceptable"" to people around me?

I mean, yes, there are major parts of me that wish I could have been born afab.. but there are equally major parts of me that love exactly who I am. Why should I feel ashamed of being a trans woman? I am finally starting to like myself and it makes me want to be proud of my trans identity.

I know this isn't the case for every trans person, and some of my best friends feel very differently about this. They consider themselves simply men &amp; women and think of their transsexuality as a purely medical issue, and i totally get this. 

I guess what is confusing/difficult for me is trying to balance this desire to be authentic to myself with my desire for social acceptance. I present strongly feminine in life, and hearing ""she/her"" just floods me with joy.. but at the same time, I feel the need to push back against becoming fixated on this. I want to be okay with being in public without obsessing about whether my facial hair is starting to show, or worrying about my voice if I get excited.. 

I'm sorry if this is random and rambling. I guess I just needed to process this, and wanted to share with someone... I'm proud of who I am, damnit!

2016-12-11 20:12:52,5hs3fq,14,16,"TL;DR  I thought I was trans (FtM), but after accepting and exploring my masculine side some more, I've become strangely more okay with being feminine and less certain that I want hormones.  I definitely need an outlet to explore my gender identity, but I am confused now as to what form that should take.

Hi everyone.  I have some gender identity issues I'm sorting out, and I used to think I was trans (FtM), but now I'm not sure it's that simple.  I do have a relationship with a straight cis man, which complicates things (we are talking through it and he is giving me space to explore, but he's clearly very anxious), but I want to focus on my own feelings.

I have always wished/believed I were a boy, since I was in preschool.  Puberty as a female was horrible for me.  Then I tried to ignore dysphoria and live as a masculine/androgynous woman (I'm over 30 now).

Last year, dypshoria raged up, focused on wanting a deeper voice, facial hair, and muscles.  I now live in an area very accepting of queer people.  I told my friends and family what was going on, joined a friend/support group, cut my hair, bought a binder and men's clothes, picked a name, and began seriously thinking about testosterone.  I feel very positive about most of what I've done so far.  In fact I have a consultation appointment next week to discuss T.

But... 

Right after I made the consultation appointment, my brain suddenly screamed, ""NO.""  Suddenly I did not want to proceed with T.  It doesn't feel entirely like fear (although there is definitely fear of the unknown, as well), it feels like no, this isn't what I want.  

See, there are situations where I like being female, and this has always been a stable facet of my personality.  I said when I started coming out, that I feel like a guy 60-70% of the time, but not 100%.  That proportion has been stable throughout my life.  I have no problem with PIV sex and being treated as female/feminine during that activity.  I enjoy the way men treat me, as female, when we're in a romantic relationship.  I never get dolled up to an extremely feminine degree, but for example, I enjoy wearing low-cut shirts or a skirt when I'm out on a date with my SO.  Not always, but it's not uncommon, either.  I know I look good and I feel sexy like that.  Makeup is a no, but jewelry and female clothes are a yes.  I've been enjoying women's clothes a bit more since giving room to my masculine side.  I *also* really like my short hair, wearing my binder and men's clothes, and being called by my male name by friends in the know.

Therefore, I am not sure anymore that T is for me.  I like my curvy hips (except when trying to squeeze into men's pants) and I like my breasts, mostly.  Sometimes I wish they were bigger, sometimes I wish they were gone, but I don't want top surgery because I'd miss them.  I want muscles, facial hair, and a deeper voice, but my body modification desires have a very hard stop at that point.  I hate the idea of body hair; I like my soft, smooth, hairless skin.  I don't really want a penis (I wouldn't mind having one, but I like my vagina well enough, and very much do not want my clit to grow).  I tried packing with a roll of socks and it did nothing for me, I didn't care that it was there or have any interest in it.  If I went bald on T, I would feel horrible, as I like my hair.  I also suspect, from looking at the men in my family, that I wouldn't get a very deep voice or very much facial hair anyway.  That means I'd likely only get an increase in muscle mass, which, to be fair, I do want; it was my earliest sign of dysphoria.

But I think being overtly male would cause me as much bodily distress as I'm already in, it would just focus on different things.  And I don't get to pick and choose what changes I get.  

Also, I enjoy compartmentalizing who I'm out to.  For example, I have never, ever had the desire to legally change my name or my gender marker.  For example, I don't want people at work to know - my personal life is just not their business.  So I feel like if I started T and my body changed, but didn't change my name or gender marker, I'd have to lie or explain it over and over and I don't want to.  I definitely want my friends and family to know, but I kind of like that it's this secret life I get to explore on my own time; I don't care a whole lot that the general public views me as female, except when dealing with sexism (I've been lucky and not encountered it much).  I do need an outlet for my masculine side, I can't keep it completely to myself, but right now it feels like a secret identity, and that feels *fun*.

Furthermore, general mental health issues:  I regularly suffer from pretty extreme depression and anxiety, and I wonder if T might help with that.  But then again, I suspect I'm idealizing T as a magic bullet for my mental health, and that I'd feel better on it for a while, then realize I still have all this depressive crap there to deal with.  I have also had over two years of major upheavals in my life that are certainly not easy to deal with even at the best of times.

I am in counseling with a therapist specializing in gender identity issues, and it's helping a lot.  More than any counseling I've ever had, and I've been through a lot of counselors.  I'm not on antidepressants at the moment; I've tried several, and tend to have bad mental reactions to them, and react very differently even if the inert ingredients change (like from one generic to another).  So I'm leery of medication in general.

   Regardless, I do love that non-binary identities exist, and I take great comfort that genderqueer is a label that resonates with me.

2016-12-14 04:29:21,5i8kvu,11,3,"Merry Christmas! I’ve been watching Rudoph the Red-nosed Reindeer (1964) the claymation Rankin-Bass classic, and I wanted to shed some light on how I watch the movie, and how I see it as a movie about the LGBTQ community coming together and rising above the adversity we have in our lives everyday. I do not think my take on the film was the original intention on the creators (with one small exception), but I do believe the message of Misfits finding a home was. I would love to hear your thoughts and input. 

Rudolf is born with an apparent “defect,” one could see this as a metaphor for a physical disability. I chose to think that Rudolf was born as transgender, inter-sexed or particularily flamboyant. His parents don’t take him to a doctor or seek out the advice of anyone else, they simple see the defect and immediately talk of making a “buck” out of him. They cover his nose and call him, “My normal little buck.” I have a theory that glowing red noses are something that happen at the northpole, and are just never talked about, considering his parents don’t see surprised, disappointed, but not surprised. 

Then we move to Hermey the elf. Hermey is gay. This is the one exception I made above, I think the creators intentionally made Hermey a gay character. One, he’s very sensitive and is the only male elf who styles his hair. This may seem like archaic stereotypes in 2016, but in 1964, these were tells. He also dreams of being a dentist, which I think is true, but there’s more than that, there’s an innate not fitting in or wanting to do what’s expected (Making toys = finding a wife, having a family ect.)  There is this small pause that happens every single time he declares his dream to be a… dentist. Hermey tries to fit in, by fixing the teeth in the dolls, but the act of trying to fit in only shows more and more of his Misfitness. 

Rudolph goes to the reindeer games, where his parents force him to look like the other young deer. Forcing him to wear things that are hiding his grater character. This strikes me as incredibly similar to stories of parents forcing their trans children in the dresses or suits. “There’s more important things than comfort, self respect” says Donner. 

Rudolph meets Fireball and Clarice. Fireball is just another reindeer who will be appalled by Rudolph’s true nature when he is outted during the reindeer games. These reindeer games, which seem to me like a sports team, complete with a coach wearing a whistle.  These games around about being bucks=men. The girls are just there to watch and it’s the boys, the real boys who are there to show their stuff. Rudolph preforms better than all the other bucks, but his flight is brought to an abrupt halt when his nose covering falls off and he is outted in front of the entire team. The way the other deer react, including Coach JerkFace is a nightmare (and reality) version of other people outting stories. Clarice, who declares Rudolph as “cute” right before he is outted, comes back to him insisting that his nose is what makes him special. She sings him a song that might as well be titled, “It Gets Better.” Clarice is the most open minded creature in the northpole, including Santa. 

It’s Clarice’s father who ruins it for everyone and drags his daughter away from the “weirdo.” This is when Rudolph finds Hermey, and they decide to run away together. This, I think, is a metaphor for the unity among the LGBTQ community back in 1964 when we had to band together as a community in the face of all the hate. Rudolph being trans, in different from Hermey who is gay, at times those communities overlap,  but it is not always the same story. However, Misfits are Misfits, and we find strength when we find each other. 

Enter Yukon Cornelius, who is not a metaphor, he is exactly as written. He is a Redneck with a heart of gold, a lower class white man who is also forced into the Misfit category because of his socioeconomic status. He knows he is at the bottom rung of society, which makes him more open minded to other Misfits. We see this happen in real life when small communities find out a member of their community is LGBTQ and accept them, because they are in the community. Google Stu Rasmussen if you don’t believe me.  
So our Misfits set out together, but they are not alone. They are followed by the abominable snow monster of the north, Old Bumble. This metaphor is of the very sad circumstances when a LGBTQ person is in denial. They hate themselves for being LBGTQ, but they also hate the community around them, knowing they’ll never be accepted by them. He is the ultimate Misfit, no room for him any where. He’s particularity drawn to Rudolph because he sees himself reflected in the young deer.  
The island of Misfit toys is obviously a gay bar, or at least a gay bar you would have found in the 1960s. Today it would be an LGBTQ center, or a Gender Health Center. A place for all us Misfits to find each other. I’m particularity interested in the doll and her passing privilege. She doesn’t declare why she is on the island, or what makes her different. She has passing privilege, but there is clearly something keeping her out of Santa’s bag. Sometimes LGBTQ status is invisible. 
The night that Hermey, Cornelius, and Rudolph spend on the island of Misfit toys, obviously gave Rudolph a lot to think about. Even on an island, full of other Misfits like him, he still feels like an outcast. Community is not just about being LGBTQ, yes that runs deep, but it’s not what defines us. Rudolph has a family, he has Clarice, he has an entire personality that doesn’t revolved around his nose. He may be a Misfit, but he is other things too. He truly feels he has no home. Until he can strike out on his own, a really find out what being a Red-Nosed Reindeer is all about. 
Rudolph goes home to face his parents, but they are gone. They went looking for him and got themselves caught by the abominable snow monster. 
Rudolph shows down with the Bumble, and Cornelius and Hermey come to the rescue. The three Misfits take away his teeth, his weapons (his “God Hates Fags” signs). Finally Bumble and Cornelius fall off a cliff together. Finally having the connection that the Bumble needs. A conservative Christian who doesn’t hate LGBTQ folks, Cornelius is the perfect match to finally show the Bumble what he needs to see in order to love himself. 
Everyone returns to Christmas town, and everyone in Christmas town is coming around. I’ve heard critiques of the ending, saying that Santa only accepted Rudolph after he was deemed useful, I disagree. I think it was because everyone in Christmas town was a little more open minded they were able to allow the Misfits to do what they were good at in the first place. An LGBTQ person might be a fantastic dentist, but you’d never know if you didn’t let them in first. 
So Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night!! This movie means a lot to me, and I obviously really enjoy talking about this theory of mine. Feel free to comment, shoot me down, or simply proclaim your Misfitness.

I wish my body were less masculine, particularly my facial features. I want softer, more traditionally ‘feminine’ facial features. I strongly dislike having hair on my body; my legs, chest, arms, and I especially dislike having hair on my face and neck (though I do have an inexplicable affinity for sideburns).

Looking back, there are a lot of AFAB people, particularly those who are androgynous or masculine, who I have been attracted to in an odd sense. Though of course I found many of them to be attractive as potential partners, many other times, I was not sexually attracted to them in the way that I am attracted to someone who I want to be with, but rather aesthetically attracted to them in the sense that I just really liked the way they looked. Often I found that I envied their looks and wished that I looked like that. I’ve only recently come to fully understand this kind of thinking in the context of my own gender identity and dysphoria.

I can think of a number of ways I have felt dysphoric, but did not know how to process it because I did not desire to present very femininely. For instance, I’ve always felt more comfortable in briefs or other tight-fitting underwear than I did in boxers or naked. Now that I know more about dysphoria, I’m able to recognize why I feel more comfortable in certain underwear, when it seems like everything is kept in place, than I did when I was naked. I feel like this does for me what binding does for AFAB men (though of course, not being one myself, this is admittedly speculation). Generally, the tighter fitting they are, the better.

Sometimes I’m more or less comfortable with my male body, other days I’m not. I’m not sure if this is because I’m truly comfortable in my own body, or if I’ve just grown accustomed to seeing myself this way and knowing other see me this way. Sometimes I’m comfortable with my male genitalia, or at least not uncomfortable, but other times they just feel like they’re in the way, and I don’t really want them. I’m used to having them, I suppose, so I can’t really imagine what not having them would be like. Sometimes, I imagine having female genitalia would be much more comfortable, but then other times I’m not entirely sure.

I’ve thought about getting on estrogen and/or having surgery, but am admittedly afraid of making such a permanent change. On the one hand, even though this may feel right now, I worry I might feel differently later in life and regret it. My perception of my body and gender has changed in the past, what if it changes again? I can’t even bring myself to get a tattoo because it’s permanent; this is huge. On the other hand, I’m worried that the longer I wait to begin transitioning, and thus the longer I spend developing and maturing masculinely in this male body, the more difficult it will be to look the way I want, and I will have missed an opportunity. On top of all of that, I have to factor in the cost of transitioning and the difficulty of coming out as a non-binary person who’s transitioning – neither of which are easy things to come out as.

So yeah, that’s what I’ve been feeling. I don’t know exactly what kind of advice I’m looking for, but feel free to share anything that might be helpful.

2016-12-16 02:29:32,5ilst5,2,18,"So about a month ago, I vented a bit about some insurance issues. I had been denied approval for an orchiectomy and the representative of the insurance company had no-showed at the hearing.

I set down and put all of my reasoning for why the denial of my claim was flawed into an email to the representative of the insurance company. Part of me thought they'd use it to better prepare their reasoning for the hearing, but I felt like they could push the hearing back indefinitely(though I later read the comments and saw some wiser advice, but I'd already sent my hopes in an email). After a few weeks, I got an email from the representative telling me that my surgery was approved. Suffice it to say that a specific ""regulation""(not sure what the individual pieces would be called) regarding transgender health care in the Washington Administrative Code that the insurance used to deny my claim specifically mentioned nonbinary genders elsewhere in the same ""regulation"". So I am really grateful for whoever included that language in the ""regulation"".

Well, obviously, I was ecstatic. I thought about responding directly to those who had responded to my initial post, but it was weeks later and I guess I was scared they'd consider it a bother to receive a response to something after that long. Honestly, I wish I had seen the advice and responded sooner, but I didn't and, even had I seen it sooner, I'm kind of flaky. How did this paragraph turn into this? Anyway, I scheduled my orchiectomy for some time in March and sort of got back to life. I got a call about a week ago and, somehow, they had an unexpected opening today. So I got up at 4:30 this morning and went into to Seattle to get an orchi! I woke up with only the smallest amount of pain and super happy!

So in a dream I had a couple of days ago, my body and genitals were changable/fluid. Thus, I could actualize whichever body parts I desired. I was  estatic and euphoric and felt so happy and it felt like a boulder was lifted off my chest. One of the best  parts was I was on my own and had a safe place to transition! Finally, The Holidays meant something! I was the adrogynous person I wanted to be!

 Until, well.. I woke up. 

I don't think I ever felt this grim and dissapointed about waking up practically, ever.  It really is  demanding being appalled by my body, It's a chore. slowly this actualization has crippled my ability to be satisfied with myself and i'm incapable of changing it seeing myself naked is the worst of all. I'd have a pleasanter time observing maggots wriggle around in a bucket than see this garbage.  I predict that things might have been much better if I figured out this stuff in a more independent era of my life, so I wouldn't have to split extra hairs to, you know, be closeted. I have no idea how my parents or relatives would react, but with the things they say it'll likely be with a laugh. Even if they took it ""well"", I'd still feel cumbersome. Some people you just don't want to be around when you transition, you know? Just  not the right crowd.

 And The worst thing about all this is even if I do find a way to afford hormones and Phalloplasty, this sly devil will still taunt me. ""It's  practically fake"" It says, ""you still don't look the way you desire""  It mutters. ""There's so many complications, it wont last"" ""Hey, didn't you want FLUIDITY?

2016-12-20 16:55:07,5jeask,9,19,"Hey yall-
(First of all, let me know if I use terms incorrectly. Still pretty new to this.) I'm AFAB, 22, bi.
A few nights ago, I had a bit of a breakdown with a friend that understands gender much more than I do. I think it's been building for a while.

I have never identified with other women from a gender standpoint. I've always felt third party, even though I really enjoy dressing femininely. I was raised female in a conservative home but felt passive aggressively pressured to cover up/not wear makeup/etc, so I haven't tried exploring my femininity until recently. I was constantly mixed up for being male until 2 years ago. I love dresses, feel most comfortable in makeup, and, even though I wrestle with body dysphoria sometimes, I am mostly happy in a female body. I'm okay with she/her pronouns, but hearing them feels...a little foreign to me. I love dressing femininely with a boyish haircut, and I like naturally having board, more masculine arms and shoulders. ([The most recent pic of myself that I'm really happy with. Someone called me handsome on Facebook and that was really nice??](http://imgur.com/ulryEPD)) I could see myself changing to androgynous pronouns later. At one point in college, I avoided seeing my whole body in a mirror for over a year because I felt so confused by it.

I think exploring my femininity is causing a bit of a quarter life crisis. I feel like I'm transitioning from basically being gender-neutral until about a year ago to being female, but at the same time, I still don't identify with other women? I feel like this femme third party that I don't know how to describe.

What is...what is genderqueer to you? Does anyone identify with this? It seems so backwards to feel like I'm shifting from neutral to female, but still better-identifying and more comfortable with androgynous folks.

2016-12-29 19:58:16,5kyuxg,27,15,"So let me start out by saying I completely support anyone's wish to have HRT or surgeries in order to feel more aligned/comfortable in their body. I am just wondering who here in this community is not choosing to go that route (particularly AFAB people who do not want testosterone or top surgery, but if you are AMAB and also are not choosing to have surgery or HRT, I welcome your response.) I don't particularly like being gendered female, but I also don't want to masculinize my body with hormones. I don't like my breasts showing through my clothes, but I also don't want them surgically removed.

2016-12-30 12:08:51,5l34wc,6,7,"This is a bit confusing for me but let me try explain my situation.

I am 44 born as a male and diagnosed with genderdysphoria.
Currently on HRT (Cyproterone Acetate and Estrogen)
Whole my life I never experienced any problems with myself,  I never felt that I was a male, and my desire to be female was minimal.
I always had an androgynous appearance which was pretty much okay with me.     I didn't care which dressingroom or restroom I had to use,  I just use the one that draws the least attention.
Since about 5 years ago,  I slowly began to lose my androgynous look,   and started to look more like a typical male.  I was repulsed by myself and everyday I looked in the mirror and watched that face that was almost screaming the words: ""Male, Dude, Man"" at me.  My Dysphoric feeling began to develop.   I always had long hair since I was a kid,  but when I saw the thinning and my scalp shining through my hair in the middle I almost had to puke.

All of sudden I wanted everything to get rid of that horrible masculine face, in fact I wanted to get rid of everthing remotely masculine,   HRT, SRS,  FFS, facial hair removal you name it. 
After countless interviews I was diagnosed with Genderdysphoria.
And eventually started with HRT and I had multiple sessions(laser) to have my facial hair removed.

Now I begin to change,  slowly the masculinity of my face is disappearing, reverting back to the androgynous look I had,  my hair shows the very first signs of recovery.
And with it,  my dysphoric feelings seems to diminish as well.

Seemingly,  I don't have a strong desire to be a female (although I prefer that over being a male).
But I do have a very strong feeling of disgust when I look like a typical male.  

Bottom line is:   I don't care whether I am a man or a women,  as long as I don't look like a man.  As long as people are unable to determine my gender, or see me as woman. That's fine with me.

Does that make me a Genderqueer?

My profile clearly states with these pre-selected labels that I am genderqueer and non-binary, though I do not provide a written explanation about my identity in my self-summary.
