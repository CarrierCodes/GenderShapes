2016-01-01 23:33:39,3z2n1l,3,9,"Hi there! So I'm having an issue and was hoping for some advice from you guys! 

I am afab and I absolutely *love* most things stereotypically ""girly"", which means that I fit almost perfectly into the ""female"" stereotype. In one way it'd be so easy to pretend to be cis and live like that. But I have *a lot* of social dysphoria, so that's not really an option for me. And I'm really scared of coming out, so to see if it would help with the dysphoria, I wore neutral clothes for a few months. In one way dressing neutrally helped, because people no longer said things like ""you're such a tiny and cute little girl!"", and they stopped acting protective and flirty (this is really the part I hate most. When people act as if I'm this fragile little creature that needs protection). But I felt miserable, because I missed being able to dress the way I like to. I mean, my favourite color is pink, and I love glitter and makeup etc, so looking the way I'd like to, more or less guarantees that people will say that I'm tiny and cute, and I'm *really* not comfortable with that. I've at least come to the solution that I shouldn't force myself to look more neutral, because that's just not who I am.

So my issue now is that I don't know what do to about this. I need to lessen the social dysphoria, so the options I can see so far are: 

1: Living with my dysphoria and pretending to be cis (I've been doing this for the last 8 months - so far it's not been working very well. And the thought of continuing to do this makes it feel like my stomach is sinking down into a bottomless pit)

2: Coming out and having to deal with the doubts and questions that would inevitably follow. But I'm really scared of coming out, because most people I know don't think non binary gender identities are a real thing, and that it's just a phase. And knowing that they feel that way makes me worried that they wouldn't take me seriously at all, because on top of not thinking NB people are real, they'd see my twirly skirts and make up and think that I've gone mad.

Ugh, this is really draining me of energy, so if anyone has had a similar experience, I'd love to hear how you solved it, because this is really starting to get to me.

2016-01-02 06:23:29,3z4177,2,10,"Hi, so I'm FAAB, but I've always had a relatively deep voice for a lady, have always disliked how I look, and had a few detractors all through secondary school who teased me for my massive chin and how I ""look like a man"". I probably don't have that big of a chin and have quite a few friends who say so if this is ever mentioned, but it still feels big to me, and the way my larynx sits, I have less definition at the bottom than I'd like. 
I also don't think I have a particularly feminine body shape - I'm more than a little bit chubby at 14st and 5'7"" and my boobs are tiny, so the chub on my stomach sticks out far enough that on bloated days I either look a few months pregnant or like a man with moobs and a beer gut, depending on what my self-esteem levels are like that day. 
I also take after my dad in the face more than my mum, and my brother took after my mum more, and it's always bugged me that he's always been ~prettier~ than me. (I mean, he doesn't need it, right? There's a larger margin for men's looks than women's in terms of what is deemed attractive imo.) Although I have quite nice legs, and on good days I can actually like my face a bit and maybe feel a bit better about my broad shoulders, that's about it - everything between my shoulders and hips is a fucking disaster zone.
Also, I'm not very good at putting on makeup; although I've found a good lip colour and have found a way of doing my eyeliner that I actually like, eye makeup takes ages and doesn't feel worth the effort half the time. And my skin is such that even when I think I've exfoliated and moisturised enough, I can't put on foundation in my T zone without looking part lizard.

I'm currently toying with the idea that I might be genderqueer, because some days the idea of binding and wearing masculine clothing really appeals to me, but then some days I look back on it and feel like it might be false bravado, like I had that one summer where I grew out my leg hair and wore shorts the whole time (and pretended I was okay with it, but eventually realised it made me intensely unhappy sometimes not only because I looked unfeminine and disgusting, but also I was aware of the potential summer romances I was missing out on by alienating potential love interests with my manly manly legs.) Some days the idea of dressing up and presenting as male kind of makes me feel sick. But then maybe that's what it is to be genderqueer: to have those days where you present as female because presenting masculinely doesn't appeal to you at all. But I don't know for sure.
I want to join a gym as soon as I can and start weight training so I can at least be a tough muscly androgynous being instead of the ugly genderless blob I currently am, but I'm worried I'll just look uber-masculine then (despite absence of paunch and extra bit of chestiness that having pec muscles would give me) which I guess I'll just have to contend with, as currently being chubby is probably making me more dysphoric than being muscly would make me. Especially since I'll probably be able to fit into more clothes that I actually think look good on me. But I can't know for sure.

Basically, I'm not sure if I'm genderqueer or just thinking of compensating for looking unfeminine by trying to be masculine on my own terms, instead of by accident and then trying too hard to look feminine on days when sometimes my self-esteem is so low that I can't focus enough and so just can't be fucked with the effort involved in that. I feel like maybe it's the kind of thing where I could just be ashamed of the idea of being masculine because I used to get teased for it, so maybe if I present more often as masculine and get comfortable with the idea then I could actually enjoy it?
Also, I know it's stupid, but I'm worried that presenting as masculine here and there is going to put off potential romantic interests, and I don't know if that would be exclusively gynosexuals either - what if bi-/polysexuals are put off by my changing and switching around? For example, I identify as pansexual, but I feel like I could be more attracted to men sometimes while just admiring females from afar but not seeing them as dateable (although this could be due to my daddy issues making me want more male attention and the worry that all women I'm attracted to could almost invariably do better than me, so why should I bother pursuing any crushes on that part of the continuum?)

So yeah. I'm a mess. Would appreciate any advice.

P.S. I currently have long hair, which I love and so don't feel too conflicted about. I'm considering shaving the sides so it'd be easier to style in more masculine ways.

2016-01-03 18:04:23,3zapmu,20,15,"Hi, I am 17 year old who has been having transgender feelings for the last year. Although these feelings are real, they started out sexual. This worries me because I am not sure if I have a crossdressing fetish or I am actually transgender. Eventually I began having non sexual thoughts about being a woman. These thoughts included myself overall feeling happier, enjoying nature more, and being a nicer person. As a male, I do not experience much body dysphoria. I do however recognize that this is not necessary to be trans. What I have is body euphoria. I would feel much happier in a female body. From this I concluded that my dysphoria is that my body is preventing me from achieving euphoria although I do not hate my body. Another thing that has been bothering me is that these feeling are very recent. Most trans people say ""I always new something was different"" or ""I played with girls toys when I was a child"". I have none of these things. Looking back, in the first grade I declared I was a girl to my classmates, but these feelings were brief and I probably did this for attention. Other than that, I played with boys toys and never ""knew I was different"". These feeling didn't even start when I started puberty, so im really concerned they are not genuine or that I am faking it. Although it started sexually, I am trying to act more female day by day and am hinted my family and friends. I am worried this is from my hormones and is just sexual because of my little dysphoria.

I am not saying that it is disrespectful to change your name, as it is perfectly reasonable in many situations. However, the way I see it (at least in my situation) is that my parents picked a specific name for me to have my whole life just for me to disregard it and name myself just because I didn't really like what they picked for me?

I suppose the main issue is that I think changing my name is very drastic in this situation and that I can't help but feel my parents would feel betrayed.

I'm just curious as to what my long term sexual function could be expected to be. Obviously that varies from person to person but Im interested in hearing perspectives because I'm coming to realise that I do quite enjoy topping with my own equipment (for quite a while this wasn't the case, but I have lately) and am worried I will lose size and function over time even if I can manage frequent use. Impotence is something that worries me especially because I have a partner. 

I'm not sure if my failure to perform in the past was a worry that I wouldn't be able to or a lack of libido or both. 

This is one of the things (among other issues I have) that keeps me sitting on the fence about things and is why ive stopped and started transition before. I feel pretty conflicted with my gender and where I want to go.

Both have pros and cons to me unfortunately :( so I'm just trying to work out what is the best path for me to take.

She had questions, I answered them, and after that she refused to acknowledge my identity, continued to use he/him pronouns for me, and started more frequently telling me and other people that I'm a ""boy"". Since then, we talked about it every so often and eventually presentation came up. I talked to her about dysphoria and wanting my appearance to be androgynous to match how I feel mentally, and that I was infatuated with makeup and skirts and leggings and all these feminine things, and that I'd be so much happier if I could just look how I felt. She was quick to tell me no, and used bullying and my homophobic and transphobic father (who neither of us even talk to) as excuses, as well as told me it might be a phase and I had to wait until I'm an adult (I'm 15 now). We've continued discussing this for the past few years and my feelings haven't changed, nor have her thoughts.

Over time, the dysphoria and depression has gotten worse, to the point where I've isolated myself from friends and family periodically, and there have been times where I've started crying my eyes out getting dressed in the morning because I feel like I'm being forced to be someone I'm not.

2016-01-11 04:39:59,40f4sv,8,10,"So I've been out to my parents for over a year now (almost 2 years to my dad).  They've mostly adapted to my name (yay) but unilaterally refuse to use my pronouns ""because grammar is important"" (boo).  However, they both claim to be really supportive.

I've been really open about wanting top surgery, and I've talked with them about getting it done this winter and how I feel like it's a prime time since, as I'm unemployed, there won't be any rush for me to get back to a job where I might hinder recovery.  And my parents seemed okay with that.

Well tonight, I mentioned to my mom about how I need to schedule a few doctor's appointments next week--physical therapy to help me get back into the swing of things after an appendectomy almost a month ago, a gyno appointment to sort out the endometriosis/PCOS/not-yet-diagnosed issue with my junk, and a consult with a surgeon for top surgery.  First two, mom was chill.  Last one mom flipped out and ended up asking me how I was planning to pay for top surgery.  I said that I assumed that she and my dad would help me pay for it beyond what insurance covers (which will still probably be around 2-3 grand because our current policy is kind of the worst), since they've been helping me cover all other healthcare bills (and didn't even suggest that I need to pay the bills from the appendectomy).  She basically was like ""yeah no, that's not necessary so I don't think we'll be helping you out"".  It's not a money issue at all because my parents make a shitload of money (and are trying to convince me to skip out on 2 weeks of my seasonal job to go to Norway with them, which they'll pay for so like they have the money lying around).

And I'm really frustrated right now because no, top surgery IS as necessary to my health as the appendectomy was.  It's just not an emergency surgery.  And like I have a therapist who is supportive and willing to write me a rec letter for surgery and agrees that this is necessary and I told my mom this and she basically doesn't believe me or evidently a qualified healthcare professional?  Like I wouldn't try to advise her on what dental treatment a patient of hers needed, so why is she assuming that she knows better than me and my therapist (especially since she's refused to do any research on trans folks herself or read the resources I've suggested).

And the worst part is that the whole time my mom was like ""I just want to understand you"" and ""I support you"".  But like words mean things.  You can't just say them and then do the exact opposite and assume what you said is the truth.

I have an appointment with my therapist on Wednesday for other issues but I guess those won't get addressed and this will.  If y'all have advice or ways you've gotten through to stubborn parents, I'd love to hear it.

I said that I assumed that she and my dad would help me pay for it beyond what insurance covers (which will still probably be around 2-3 grand because our current policy is kind of the worst), since they\'ve been helping me cover all other healthcare bills (and didn\'t even suggest that I need to pay the bills from the appendectomy).  She basically was like ""yeah no, that\'s not necessary so I don\'t think we\'ll be helping you out"".  It\'s not a money issue at all because my parents make a shitload of money (and are trying to convince me to skip out on 2 weeks of my seasonal job to go to Norway with them, which they\'ll pay for so like they have the money lying around).\n\nAnd I\'m really frustrated right now because no, top surgery IS as necessary to my health as the appendectomy was.  It\'s just not an emergency surgery.  And like I have a therapist who is supportive and willing to write me a rec letter for surgery and agrees that this is necessary and I told my mom this and she basically doesn\'t believe me or evidently a qualified healthcare professional?  Like I wouldn\'t try to advise her on what dental treatment a patient of hers needed, so why is she assuming that she knows better than me and my therapist (especially since she\'s refused to do any research on trans folks herself or read the resources I\'ve suggested).\n\nAnd the worst part is that the whole time my mom was like ""I just want to understand you"" and ""I support you"".  But like words mean things.  You can\'t just say them and then do the exact opposite and assume what you said is the truth.\n\nI have an appointment with my therapist on Wednesday for other issues but I guess those won\'t get addressed and this will.  If y\'all have advice or ways you\'ve gotten through to stubborn parents, I\'d love to hear it.  If not, it was just nice to let off a little steam.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'so my """"""""supportive"""""" mother really sucks at this ""support"" thing', 'created': 1452512399.0}"

Over the last [insert timeframe here], I have been in the process of updating my wardrobe in an attempt to reduce the amount of masculinity I project. Between that and also playing around with eyeliner &amp; nail polish, I don't think I'm doing a bad job (we'll conveniently ignore the shoddy excuse for a beard I'm currently sporting).

However, I am still somewhat limited in what I can find. I don't really do fancy patterns or predominant bright/bold colours for one. I'm also only looking in the menswear section - I don't feel comfortable even looking in the womens' section, let alone trying to find out if there would be anything there I like that would actually suit me (a tall ask, imo), and that would be tenfold for the idea of actually wearing anything in public that may be readily identified as such.

Despite the above, I have been able to get somewhere with:

- More form-fitting clothing (mostly through buying a smaller size)
- Skinnier jeans (easy to find, really)
- Different necklines (e.g. cowl-neck)
- Longline cuts

However, I feel like I need to expand my horizons, and was wondering anyone has anything to suggest for the following:

- Good stores/locations/websites to shop for androgynous men's clothing **in the UK**. I get bored looking in H&amp;M, Zara, River Island, etc, for the one or two lines they sell that might be what I'm looking for.
- Anything, perhaps, that might be typically designed for women, or at least designated as such by the retailer, but I could wear as a 6' male and look androgynous as opposed to a cross-dresser.

I would love it if anyone had any ideas.

Background: Hi, Im 17 years old and have been having transgender feelings for about 4 months now. I have a TON of self doubt because I don't feel too dysphoric and these feeling are new. Also for the past couple days i've been feeling more manly. (I think this is because I am this way around girls that I like).
Coming Out: (all of this just happened) Anyways I digress. So today when I finished exams I went home and told my mother I was going to get some new shoes. She asked me which shoes and I said pink converse high tops. The only reason I really wanted these was to hint my mother. Either way they were nice shoes and I needed new ones. She told me I couldn't get them because my father might get pissed at her for buying them. (He is gone for business now.) Overall she didn't seem too put off. She just made jokes later like ""come here, check out this pink thing"". Later in the night my sister was complaining to her about me wanting the shoes (she thinks ill ruin her ""image""). So we were all talking and my mother said ""not that there is anything wrong with this but, people might see those shoes as gay. I nervously said ""I'm not gay"". Next she said ""your not a Caitlyn are you"" while laughing. I laughed nervously and drank water to pretend I wasn't talking. She said ""you don't want to change your gender or have surgery for boobs haha"". I said I don't want any surgeries and said ""I have to go upstairs and study"". My sister was mortified. My mother was kind of chuckling nervously. I went to my room and studied. I was shaking. Five minutes later she came in and said ""I know you just like those shoes because you like them. I said I like them and they are cool. She said, ""you want to change your gender and have surgery"" (she obviously has no idea what hormones are). I giggled nervously saying ""you got it"". She kept asking me things and I said ""I have to study"" She softly said ""you can talk to me"" and stuff. I said I know and she said ""if you are having these feelings we can take you to someone to help you"". Not sure if gender therapist or conversion type of therapist. Anyways It just kinda ended on her not really being completely sure of anything and her leaving saying she loves me.
I have no idea what to do if this is brought up again. She has always said its ok if I'm gay but this is different. Hopefully she will do some research before talking to me again. I just want acceptance until I figure myself out. Please advise?

I'm not looking forward to growing body or facial hair and will likely get that lasered. I'm hoping I can find the sweet spot of a genderedly ambiguous/neutral body which allows me some versatility in presentation.

2016-01-16 18:36:19,419led,3,40,"I social dance regularly, blues and swing. I've also been growing out my hair, and it's in a zone that it looks a little androgynous, in that if I'm wearing men's clothes it looks like a male haircut but if I'm wearing a dress it can look more feminine.

I wore a dress to a dance last night, and I had several things happen for the first time:

* Someone got confused about my gender when he met me, and then asked me how I like people to refer to me. I found this funny and also flattering and it left me feeling empowered.
* I went to go to the restroom, and someone pointed me towards the women's room. This *really* surprised me, I had assumed most people would perceive me as ""guy wearing a dress"" and I wasn't expecting this. I found it sort of exciting and flattering.
* I met someone who recognized me from another dance scene, and he was like: ""You look familiar...I was like, I think I recognize them, they dance in Baltimore.""

I actually cried after that last conversation because it was the first time anyone I don't know has ever correctly guessed/used my desired pronouns.

More though than all these interactions, I noticed a lot of changes in how people interacted with me. The changes were not subtle--they were very overt, and were repeated in interactions with multiple strangers.  It was particularly noticeable because I hadn't been to this particular scene in months, so the last times I was here I had been dressing in all men's clothing.  Some of the changes I noticed:

* When I'd ask women to dance, a lot of the time, they'd say: ""I don't know how to lead, can you lead?"" -- I have *never* had people ask me this before, people just assume that I can lead and start dancing the follow role. This was totally new. One woman I danced with, a little bit into the dance, remarked: ""Wow, you're actually a good lead!"" with a tone of surprise in her voice. I have *never* had anyone remark anything like this...people are sometimes like ""Wow, you're a good lead!"" but it's not...like ""I'm surprised that you are actually good at leading."" Even if there's perhaps a sexist assumption in there that I dislike, I still found it oddly validating to hear a remark like this because I think it showed I was being perceived differently on the gender spectrum.
* Women turned me down to dance a lot more. I actually think this is a good thing, because I don't want to dance with someone if they're kinda ambivalent about dancing with me.  I've heard radical feminist ideology talking about how socialization in our society leads to women being likely to say ""yes"" to things they don't actually want, when men ask, more often than  they are likely to do the same when women ask.  I don't know if this was going on, but I noticed that of the people I danced with, all of the people seemed really into the dances, and I had better dances on average than I usually have, and that would seem to support my theory. Alternatively, it could just be transmisogyny (""oh no, it's a guy in a dress, how creepy!"") but if this is the motivator, I think it's still good these people are turning me down because I don't really want to be surrounded by that.
* I felt more like myself and more empowered, and I had more fun. A lot of the anxiety I often feel in social situations like that was completely absent. I think a large portion of the anxiety has actually been caused by a mismatch between how people perceive me and interact with me, and how I want to be perceived. For example, the prospect of people continuing to talk to me, or saying yes to a dance, when they don't want to, is something I find terrifying, and I find in social settings I often have to expend a lot of energy to check these sorts of things. I find that, at least this night, I spent a lot less time worrying about this sort of thing, and this freed up more mental energy for connecting with people the way I wanted to. 
* I danced both parts a lot and I had amazing dances both in lead and follow roles and felt super comfy in both roles. Women also asked me to dance a lot more!

In the end, the whole experience reinforced that I'm able to step outside the gender associated with my assigned birth sex, and that by doing so, I change how people interact with me, and that in doing so, I not only become better able to live the life I want to live, but I am gaining unique and deep insights from experiencing ""both sides"" of social interactions.

I went to one of our on campus doctors at my school, and after confirming that I was certain it was what I wanted and that I was also seeing a therapist, she looked at options with me and went ahead and wrote me a prescription! :D I was super surprised because I expected gatekeeping, but she just said, ""Why would I presume to know you better than you know yourself?"" So the getting hormones part is actually not a problem!

But being NB transmasc, I have a few concerns that just won't stop bugging me. I definitely want a more masculine body and face and voice, but I'm dreading facial hair and clitoral enlargement. I'm agender, so basically my ultimate goal is to look as stereotypically androgynous as possible.

I'm not concerned about the pain aspect or anything, but have any of you tried something similar? It seems like it works well for cis women, but idk...
* How long were/are you on T? I know I'd stop doing birth control while on T, but like... if I reach a point of androgyny, can I stop T and keep the look? Or will I revert back to my estrogen look..? 
* Were/are you able to train your voice as it changes? I love singing, but I've heard a lot of trans guys say their singing voices are ruined forever....

2016-01-20 16:36:29,41v48g,4,8,"Hi!

After getting advice on this reddit few weeks ago I've looked into counselling in my area, turns out my university provides it. I've filled in a contact form and was put on the waiting list. Yesterday I got an email informing me that appointments are now available and I should come to the reception to arrange one for next week.

I should note that the initial form, later emails or the people at reception desk never asked me what is the issue I want help with.

The receptionist handed me a patient form, which had only my name on it, and ask me to fill in rest of the details, but as she handed me the form, she circled ""male"" next to the gender field. The form only had 2 options (which is it's own problem, why not just have an empty box?), and of the two I do feel male does describe me more, but I think if I'm asked to fill in a form, it should be me who does it. It was awkward and I guess one of the first times I have consciously realized what being missgenederd feels like (I was not aware of the term, and identified as male until few months ago).

What felt even worse was that while the receptionist was arranging an appointment for me, another person entered the room, and the receptionist addressed them ""I will be with you as soon as I finish with this gentleman"". The form was one thing, but she could use any number of other terms, I was a patient, a client, a student, a person. I used to like the term ""gentleman"", it made me feel grown up, but today it felt distant, made me switch off and be distracted. 

I still went through and made the appointment (next monday, yay!), and I can't blame the people working reception for not knowing about issues the specialists are meant to deal with, but at the same time I feel someone at some point should have asked me what is the issue I come with and be sensitive to it.

I just felt like I needed to share this experience, to went the anger it created. But if you do have suggestions how to deal with/avoid those situations in the future I welcome those.

2016-01-21 04:57:09,41ydnf,3,8,"I'm not sure what this post is. Whether it's a rant or seeking help or anything, but today is rough, and I feel like I'm losing it so I needed to do something. 

I was recently on HRT, low E and T for a female. I decided to drop back to just T-blockers a few weeks ago however because I was having some doubts. Anxiety around having breasts and having them fondled (which wasn't expected, could have been some other factor that gave me anxiety when I was reminded I was growing them?). Where this anxiety came from I'm not sure.

I was also afraid of being female bodied or feminine in appearance socially. I guess this is just something that bothers me because I'm not binary at all. There have been times where I've presented as female in small gatherings before and I really did enjoy it, but my personality never changes (I am considered pretty feminine I suppose already) and I don't bother with my voice. That is how I'm comfortable. I guess I never really learnt to adjust my voice because I'm comfortable with it as is, and I love to sing as is. 

Only problem is it (my voice) isn't exactly feminine, my behaviour isn't 'strictly' feminine either. So I figured that I'd drop back my HRT to prevent transitioning into a territory where I'd need to socially present more in such a way to fit into the 'woman' gender box. 

But here I am, after having dropped back to just T-blockers and I find myself some days struggling to accept my decision (or lack there-of). I look in the mirror and wish I were moving toward a more feminine appearance and it pains me because while I want to look a certain way I don't want to be forced to act a certain way. Also I'm afraid of losing sexual function. Something that was very hit and miss on E. 

I was hoping that I could keep my T relatively low and present as an androgynous male and that would be enough, but I'm not so sure anymore. Maybe this will pass, but I don't know. I want to be okay with myself, but I keep looking down at my body today and I'm not happy, I keep imagining being female bodied. 

Whether this is just one of those days that will pass, I don't know but it is seriously distressing, and it's not exactly infrequent. 

I'm trying to just accept where I'm at, but it's not working the way I'd hoped. I'm starting to think my desire to transition is more driven internally, whereas what keeps stopping my transition is more fear of external consequence. 

But this is doing my head in. Sorry if this rant doesn't make a lot of sense. Thanks for getting this far if you are still here and lending an ear.

2016-01-23 05:11:06,429is5,3,8,"For a long time, as a child, I didn't really have a concept of gender. I liked to play like a boy, dress like a boy, my dad called me ""son"" just as a joke but I took it to heart. I had a tendency to never want to wear a shirt because my boy friends didn't, and people were just people, so why couldn't I do the same. It always bugged me when people told me I had to be a certain way because I was a girl. More than that, I felt more like a boy than like a girl, but I never had any body dysphoria. A counselor would have probably called it gender identity disorder, if my parents thought I needed one. Luckily, they just figured I was a tomboy and hat I'd grow out of it.

Moving toward middle school I started being less concerned about gender. I realized I liked girls as well as guys when I was about 13, but because of my religious upbringing, I suppressed the realization that I am bi/Pansexual until I was 19, married to a man, and no longer religious. I still never liked ""girly"" things like shopping, shoes, and makeup, but I had long hair, wore female clothing, and presented as a typical girl. 

Within the last year, my masculine side really started coming out again. I could no longer stand to wear feminine clothes. I cut off my long hair into a short boyish haircut, and stopped wearing what little makeup I used to wear. For a few weeks, I was really afraid I was trans and that my life was going to turn upside down. I spent many a tearful night worrying that I was going to have to decide between telling my straight husband I am a man, and tearing the relationship apart, or keeping it to myself and making my life one I don't want to live. Thankfully, after some research and some self-reflection, I realized that I am not FtM. I am just me. I don't hate my body, and I don't want a new one. I could do without boobs, take them or leave them, and I would really love to have a penis if that was possible, but I also really love my vagina and wouldn't want to get rid of it. I have slight dysphoria about being called a ""lady"" or other feminine names, but I don't really feel like a man. I was in the shower, pondering under the hot water when I realized, I will always be exactly who I am, and nothing about me would change if I had a penis. Gender is a mostly meaningless concept that, if we remove the parts that were arbitrarily compartmentalized by society, there isn't much to as a whole. I like what I like, I dress how I dress, and I speak how I speak. That doesn't make me less of a girl and it doesn't mean I need to change. The fact that I don't want to change also doesn't mean I'm not a guy. I just don't want to be either, and yet, I'm both.

So now when someone asks if I'm a guy or a girl (which happens more often than you'd expect), my preferred answer is ""yeah, I guess"". Because I don't really know what those words mean and what they expect will change based on the answer, and I'm tired of having to choose one and try to fit into the description. I'm just a human. 

Added bonus to my realization. I explained all this to my husband, a straight cis guy. I thought he wouldn't understand and possibly be disgusted and not want me anymore. Instead, when I explained that I'm not ""just a girl, I'm kind of a guy too"" he just said, ""well duh honey, anybody who knows you could tell that."" And then he told me he wishes he could be more open like me and be sexually attracted to anyone regardless of their genitals but he's just straight, and that he'd still love me if I had a penis, even if we couldn't have sex anymore.

2016-01-23 21:55:04,42cy1s,12,3,"Sorry...not trying to sound like a whiner, but this has been bugging me for a little while now and I need to get it off my chest. 

Last year I came out to my parents as genderqueer. My dad was pretty reasonable and basically told me ""you will always be my daughter"". Okay, fair enough. I don't mind that because I don't care about pronouns, so people can call me he/she/they or what seems easy for them. Anyways, my mom's response was many laughs followed by ""you know the more you try to search for yourself, the more you lose yourself"". I was pretty upset with my mom's response and that kind of created a landslide in my former close relationship with her, she was always more accepting of people's differences in the past but lately she's gone full Trump mentality and purposefully misgenders my FtM friend...which yeah, that is not cool. 

Anyways, since then I have been really closeted about it. I really like to wear my binder and dress masculine but I can never fully pass for male and whenever my boyfriend asks questions I just tell him that I'm a tomboy, since he laughs at the idea of being genderqueer. I think he's more leaning towards the whole idea that its just a label and in reality I can do whatever I want without having to label or explain myself. Which is a fair way to look at it, I suppose. I don't know...the whole thing for me is kind of new and I didn't even realize there was a word for how I felt about my gender until last year. Only two of my friends know my identity (mainly because they both came out to me as genderfluid and gender neutral, I'm a pretty easy person to talk to) and sweeping it under the rug around my boyfriend is getting uncomfortable for me. I know he told me that I can do whatever and not have to label or explain myself, but I just want to clear the air...because while I am fine with having a biologically female body and fine with not getting any top surgery or going on hormones, I still have issues with people using my birth name. I really fucking hate my birth name and I want more people to call me by my chosen name, which more people are doing without question because my chosen name is a gender neutral one (sneaky sneaky), but its...caused a bit of eyebrow raise from the boyfriend.

My dad was pretty reasonable and basically told me ""you will always be my daughter"". Okay, fair enough. I don\'t mind that because I don\'t care about pronouns, so people can call me he/she/they or what seems easy for them. Anyways, my mom\'s response was many laughs followed by ""you know the more you try to search for yourself, the more you lose yourself"". I was pretty upset with my mom\'s response and that kind of created a landslide in my former close relationship with her, she was always more accepting of people\'s differences in the past but lately she\'s gone full Trump mentality and purposefully misgenders my FtM friend...which yeah, that is not cool. \n\nAnyways, since then I have been really closeted about it. I really like to wear my binder and dress masculine but I can never fully pass for male and whenever my boyfriend asks questions I just tell him that I\'m a tomboy, since he laughs at the idea of being genderqueer. I think he\'s more leaning towards the whole idea that its just a label and in reality I can do whatever I want without having to label or explain myself. Which is a fair way to look at it, I suppose. I don\'t know...the whole thing for me is kind of new and I didn\'t even realize there was a word for how I felt about my gender until last year. Only two of my friends know my identity (mainly because they both came out to me as genderfluid and gender neutral, I\'m a pretty easy person to talk to) and sweeping it under the rug around my boyfriend is getting uncomfortable for me. I know he told me that I can do whatever and not have to label or explain myself, but I just want to clear the air...because while I am fine with having a biologically female body and fine with not getting any top surgery or going on hormones, I still have issues with people using my birth name. I really fucking hate my birth name and I want more people to call me by my chosen name, which more people are doing without question because my chosen name is a gender neutral one (sneaky sneaky), but its...caused a bit of eyebrow raise from the boyfriend.

It's not all that uncommon for trans people to identify as genderfluid at one point or another, just as it's not uncommon for gay folks to identify as bi at one point. Being bi or being genderfluid/genderqueer are obviously very real, even if some do just use it as a stepping stone. It's sometimes easier to go midway, you know?

Well, that was the case for me. My very early days, I'd go into groups and, when asked for my pronoun, I'd say, ""Oh I don't care, whatever you want."" This would lead to me just being called ""she"" because that's just the way my body most looks. I can't blame anyone for that, after all I said that I didn't care. In actuality, it mattered more to me than I realized. Later on, I ended up joining an LGBT group and asking for different pronouns at different weeks, until I figured out which one fit me the most, and I stuck with that.

Now, I find myself of this opinion: Choose a pronoun. Any pronoun. It can change by the day, it can be he or she or they or zir or whatever fits your needs. But, hearing anyone say ""Oh I don't care, whatever"" brings me to two conclusions: That, if they really don't care, then why bring it up? Or, two, that they might actually care but for whatever reason are too shy or scared or whatever to figure out what they actually need or want.

I acknowledge that I might be an asshole for believing this, or that I'm seeing the world through my own experiences and not truly empathizing with how others are coping with their issues in their own ways. Does anyone have any experience or insight into this? Or ways in which to handle those who put the burden of pronouns on the other person?

2016-01-29 20:14:10,43am8m,2,11,"Hi everyone,
First time coming here, and I'm still not really 100% sure if this is the right place to go to, but I desperately need someplace to go and get advice from people who understand what's happening with me.
So I have always been a pretty atypical person. I've fought a lot of battles in that regard as I'm autistic and it took me a tremendously long time to get people to understand that and for me to realise that it was something that made me who am I, and not something bad just because it wasn't normal. The same situation is now playing out again, this time in regards gender identity.

I have never fit comfortably into genders. Biologically I'm a girl, and so by default I've been forced to align myself with women - in some ways, it feels okay, but in other ways, I feel physically ill if I am related to any stereotypically female things e.g. long hair, dresses etc. At the same time, I do not wish to be male either, because I can't identify as 100% a man either.

After much confusion which I've mainly gone through alone, I've figured that I am some degree of agender or androgynous. I have always wanted to be seen as someone who appears as a girl with a boy's haircut, who does not abide by either gender - the idea is so freeing, and so me, and has been around for my entire life. Now that I'm 19, I can't stand to continue much longer into my future as a fake happy girl just to keep my parents happy - I need to cut my hair short and wear the boyish shirts I like, or I know I will never truly be content.

The problem is: My parents are wonderful people and care deeply for me, but they don't understand. They've told me all of the hurtful things -  It's a confusing situation made all the more confusing by, as an autistic kid growing up, I would always look to them for guidance on how the real world worked. Having grown up now, it's hard to realise that sometimes even your rock of knowledge can be grossly incorrect and offensive about something, and in this case it's holding me back from being the free someone I was always meant to be. With my autism, it's increasingly difficult to figure out when they are lying about something to avoid me being myself.
 
I think most of all I need someone else to explain what's going on here, and how I could go about allowing my physical self to finally reflect the androgynous self I've always been. Any help or guidance in the right direction is massively appreciated, goodness knows I need it right now! &lt;3",genderqueer,Help?,1454123650.0,"{'created_utc': 1454098450, 'id': '43am8m', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 11, 'selftext': ""Hi everyone,\nFirst time coming here, and I'm still not really 100% sure if this is the right place to go to, but I desperately need someplace to go and get advice from people who understand what's happening with me.\nSo I have always been a pretty atypical person.

She was in town for a work thing and was all, ""hey let's go to this bookstore you told me about and we can look at books and stuff."") We were still kinda early into proceedings-- we met online and were still in the getting-to-know-each-other phase. So a few things hadn't really come up in conversation. Like... my gender identity.

I figured I'd deal with that after the date, after we know that we can hang out IRL and have it not be super awkward.

So, ok. It's a few hours beforehand and I go to trim my beard. I... overcommitted on one side of my face. Tried to fix it and failed. Ended up saying ""fuck it"" and shaving it off. Eeeexcept my mustache, because time constraints and bad decision making. So I ended up seeing my face in reflections on the train and thinking I looked like a fat Hulk Hogan.

And then I started feeling like I looked way too masc for my tastes, even though the beard was gone, and maybe I should've just shaved it all, and I just didn't look right. It was a weird anxiety spiral, and in the middle I was like:

""Oh. So THIS is that Gender Dysphoria stuff I've heard so much about! How fascinating! I pretty much hate it!""

This is all happening, like, an hour before the date. So, bad timing.
