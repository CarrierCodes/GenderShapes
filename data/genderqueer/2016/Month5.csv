I've identified as genderfluid/queer/nonbinary a few months now. Exactly what I identify as isn't set in stone atm and I actually feel more or less feminine/masculine sometimes. I know people will say I can't have it both ways, but I identify as a woman and non-binary, and which end of that scale I feel in can change, which is why I identify as fluid.
I feel like the ""after"" look suits me much more, and is so much more like me, but my toxic mother likes telling me that I used to be much more beautiful when I looked more feminine... I was never a traditionally femme girl by the way, I just got even less feminine in time.
When coming out to friends I had a lot of comments like ""you're a girl, you can't change that"" and even the (rather disgusting) ""so now that you're not a girl, can I hit you?""...
I don't want to have to deal with that. I just want to be myself. But the world doesn't let me have *anything*. If I considered myself cis female (which I don't), I'd get (and I did get in the past, even when I was more feminine) ""you're ugly, masculine, not a real girl, shemale"" (sorry for the term, that's just what I was called). Now that I don't identify as female I get ""that's not a real thing"".

In what follows, androgyny is defined to be the state of having ambiguous sex, which is not exactly what it typically means.


In my experience, scarves tend to be worn more by females than males, which would increase how feminine one looks. However, they also seem to be disproportionately frequently worn by gay men. Since MAABs looking to appear androgynous may adopt other traits associated with gay men, for example wearing bright colors, skinny jeans, and having a relatively high voice, wearing a scarf may lead people to conclude that a MAAB looking to present androgynous is actually a gay man. This would clearly be counterproductive for MAABs, and would probably also be counterproductive for FAABs as well, FAABs tend not to present similarly to how a gay man would, which could lead others to think the FAAB is a woman, rather than a gay man.

2016-05-04 09:03:52,4hto4o,3,5,"So I recently shaved my head and am now at the point where I might need to get a touch up. 

However I'm trying to decide on what style I want to try and grow my hair into so I don't get hair cut off that I should be keeping.

I was sporting a symmetrical undercut before I shaved my head and I loved the versatility, now however I'm considering going for a long asymmetrical undercut (think natalie dormer) because I feel my presentation is moving to an overall more feminine space.

For reference here are some pics of me:

1. Do you think I could pull this off?

2. How should I go about growing an asymmetrical haircut. Mostly you just have long hair and get it shaved on one side right? I'm a little unsure if I could grow it out over time without looking ridiculous until it gets to a good level.

3. Is having curly hair (not super curly) going to make this look bad?

4. You're all awesome and I love this community :3

Thanks for any input!

2016-05-04 13:18:27,4huf1w,22,35,"This was originally posted on my blog, but I thought it would be valuable to share on here too:

As many of my close friends and family are aware I came out as a transgender female in early 2015. Almost immediately after telling everyone in my life that I actually felt more like a girl inside, I went through a process of shedding my male identity and replacing it with a female one. I took social and medical steps to achieve this identity and change my outward appearance and lifestyle in a desperate attempt to “pass” as a female in society. This included such things as growing out my hair, wearing makeup and replacing my wardrobe of tshirts and jeans with skirts, dresses and cardigans. I began hormone replacement therapy to give myself the chemical make up of a female. In doing so I induced a second puberty, through which I watched my body morph into something more feminine over a period of 12 months.


There has been much soul searching and re-evaluation of my decision over this period. The main surprise was that as the excitement of this new found adolescence began to fade,  I had begun to miss many aspects of my old male self. Feeling further pressure to change things that I didn’t want to change, like my male voice, added to these feelings. I became severely confused and depressed, as I still had not found my answer as to whether I was truly male or female. Had I been correct in choosing to come out and transition?


Scared and confused, I locked my hormones in the drawer, pulled out my old guy clothes and went back to what had ben familiar for the last 28 years. It wasn’t long before I felt the distress of dysphoria creeping back in. Waking up in the morning and staring at my facial stubble and muscular build with a feeling of entrapment and resentment. Once again I popped back the pills and threw on some makeup and a skirt. Days passed and in certain moments, like going for a surf or watching the rugged men on Game of Thrones, I began to miss my beard and chiselled male body. The very thing I had wanted to rip from my existence only the day before!


This experience of swinging backwards and forwards every few day would continue and to this day it hasn’t stopped. I have gone on and off hormones and switched my wardrobe several times since. With a growing awareness of the trans community and the gender spectrum, I began to find people who identified as “non-binary”, who felt that they were something outside of the box of male and female. One day I stumbled across the term that resonated perfectly with what I had been experiencing my entire life and had become more prominent since I had fallen down the gender rabbit hole…. I am genderfluid


My experience of being male or female constantly changes over time. Sometimes I feel masculine, sometimes feminine, sometimes androgynous and sometimes no gender at all. With this new insight, I once again “came out” to the people close in my life. I now go by the pronouns they/them as well as she/her and I change my physical presentation based on how masculine or feminine I feel on any given day. I have gone from “transforming” to just “being” and stripping away limitations instead of trying to squeeze myself into some pre-conceived box.


I am still in the process of learning to accept myself as genderfluid and navigating the practicalities of living with a non-binary identity. Transitioning from one binary gender to another is extremely difficult, but living outside the two boxes that society prescribes brings a lot of unique challenges. What bathrooms do I use? What hormones should I have? What box do I tick when I’m filling out a form and it only has two bloody options!?  

Although facing change is difficult, I have gained so much freedom from societal expectations in the process. No matter where I end up, I have no regrets for what I have been through and where I am now. There is no greater privilege in life than owning ones self.

2016-05-06 05:42:00,4i3u6k,4,2,"Apologies, I am writing this at 6 in the morning while kinda fearing that I won't be able to get the right ''affirmations'' that my body is longing for if I don't give you the full picture of everything. So this will probably be a messy post.

Recently, 3 days ago, I discovered that I want to be a woman. Ever since then I've felt this sense of fulfillment, acceptance, giddyness and especially euphoria whenever I think about the fact that I want to be a woman. But at the same time I have this constant feeling of ''despair'' or depressed feeling which I can only describe to be nervousness and uncertainty both at the same time. That feeling is really eating on me and has been the main motivator as to why I am writing this. I've thought a lot about what could cause this feeling to appear and I've not been able to find a clear cut answer as for why these negative feelings are nearly constantly here. The closest answer I could find was the fact that when I completely relax, remove outside influences and my ego from my conscious mind, I would basically only feel that '' euphoric happiness'' as I described a short while ago. When that happens I feel completely relaxed, calm, happy, accepting of death etc. Euphoric basically. Man I am repeating myself now. Anywho, usually after an hour of feeling euphoric, thoughts of doubt and uncertainty creep in again. Primarily thoughts such as; ''What if the feelings of wanting to become a woman leave???, I don't want it to leave!!!'' 
The worst part of thoughts like that is that I don't know if it originates from the right place or the wrong place inside of me. Is it the social construct me that is clinging onto its last breaths or is it &gt;me&lt; telling me that I am not actually a woman, even though a rather powerful feeling inside of me is telling me I am.

Hopefully I've given a pretty clear view of how things are now. That way I can tell you about how I got to this point my ''Origins'' story if you want to put it like that.

Since a couple of months ago I got into sissy hypnos. It was a bit of an on and off relationship. Sometimes I'd watch and regret watching it afterwards and other times I would have periods during which I didn't touch the genre at all, but my fap interests were always specifically centered around TG (SIDENOTE: ''Played quite a bit of Trap Quest'') and some very obscure fetish. before I ever found out about sissyhypnos I would occasionally cross-dress, but that would only happen when I had refrained from fapping for 4 days to 2 weeks. SIDENOTE: ''I specifically remember that I enjoyed feeling pretty while doing so.'' Anyway, please know that I've given that bit of background information so I can get to the important part, which was the last 4 weeks up until now. 4 weeks ago I decided to start nofap/no porn (For the most part noporn) my main motivation being the whole Opioid/Dopamine system rewiring your brain article which I read about on a nofap site (Don't want to go back there, it makes me feel negative) I read it because I was fapping to some weird shit, so I thought that a 3 month nofap would definitely rewire my brain to its natural state. But when my Ergonomics doctor, who I went to regarding my RSI, told me that I cannot game for the next 2 weeks (Or stress my right arm at all for that matter.) During those 2 weeks I had Holiday. So, I thought; ''No Gaming during my vacation? Fuck, I'm going to relapse.'' And that's exactly what happened. I relapsed on the very first fucking saturday even. Didn't even regret it for a bit afterwards. On that following Monday however I purged. SIDENOTE: ''In the sense of deleting all the content/browser history and regretting my relapse a bit.'' This after purge purity continued until Wednesday when my mind pulled me back and brilliantly decided to start considering to involve weed into the equation. Absolutely no stopping my desires for this experimentation I got me some money and bought me some quality weed with a friend of mine. He smoked a bit of the stash with me. He is completely ignorant regarding my motive etc. (SIDENOTE: ''He was there Friday to sunday'') during which I strangely had gay fantasies about him. (BIG SIDENOTE: ''Remember, that what I just said was last week. FYI Timelines can be a little fucked up because I always binged on hypnos/audios during the following nights. My brain's a little hazy regarding times. + On that sunday I decided to finally start strictly following the sissy feminization program I found online somewhere'')

Anyway, Tuesday was the last day of me getting high while listening to feminization audio files. But it was also the strongest, I remember that during that day (SIDENOTE: ''Or the night before, not sure.'') I calmly listened to a one and a half an hour estrogen beat release file after which I certainly felt more female (INTERESTING SIDENOTE: ''Has/had me thinking of the possibility that the added estrogen has caused a hormonal imbalance inside me thus resulting in my current confusion'') but that's not all, because on that Tuesday night (Or morning) I listened to an audio file which I feel like changed my life (SIDENOTE: ''I believe it was made by Goddess Lucie.'') the file was about letting my inner woman out and it feels like it actually did. In the file it described euphoria, fulfillment etc. I felt everything it described so intensely. When my inner woman was coming out, I felt a part of me struggling at first, but as soon as I once again turned off my brain, everything became so intensely blissful and I felt so fulfilled. The next day I was doing pretty fine, I felt like I had to give the woman inside of me more room to breathe by shoving my ''ego'' aside. Had some strange fears saying that perhaps the woman inside was too submissive to come out etc. During that whole day however I didn't feel even a bit of despair, just acceptance, I was just spending the day making it more clear to myself that I am a woman. The kind of despair I described a while ago. But the day after that, that's when the situation started to worsen. Doubts started entering, only little by little, but barely noticeable. On that very day though I told a friend of mine that I am transgender, because a strong feeling inside of me told me that I had to and it was eating on me rapidly, so I gave in. After I basically; ''came out'' I felt soooooo relieved and fulfilled. He knew I had doubts so he helped me create a plan of what to do for the next 3 months and that's pretty much hypertrophy training combined with nofap/noporn. He said; ''Mens sana in Corpore Sano.'' And I agreed. The following day however (SIDENOTE: ''Still pretty much today, because the last time I slept was on the night I made those plans with that friend'') is when the despair fully kicked in and now everything is as I described, in this post a long way back up.

Essentially, I am pretty sure that I am depressed. And I don't know whether the depression is indicating that I am on the path to becoming me or if it's indicating that I am becoming not me.

BTW, as of late, I've barely been eating anything.

Not sure if this subreddit is the right place. So please excuse me if this is not the right place for this type of post.

If you were able to follow the whole story, I congratulate you. Right now I am not in a good state for making things very constructive. I made this post on a rather emotional basis and I apologize profusely for that, since that's a reason as to why this post is such a confusing mess. From the moment I post this I will regularly improve any mistakes I've made and make things more clear if they were unclear.

EDIT: I made a lot of probably not important sidenotes in this post. I will just tag every single one of 'em as a sidenote.


I will sleep now and patiently wait for some hopefully positive affirmations of how I feel inside.

So this will probably be a messy post.\n\nRecently, 3 days ago, I discovered that I want to be a woman. Ever since then I've felt this sense of fulfillment, acceptance, giddyness and especially euphoria whenever I think about the fact that I want to be a woman. But at the same time I have this constant feeling of ''despair'' or depressed feeling which I can only describe to be nervousness and uncertainty both at the same time. That feeling is really eating on me and has been the main motivator as to why I am writing this. I've thought a lot about what could cause this feeling to appear and I've not been able to find a clear cut answer as for why these negative feelings are nearly constantly here. The closest answer I could find was the fact that when I completely relax, remove outside influences and my ego from my conscious mind, I would basically only feel that '' euphoric happiness'' as I described a short while ago. When that happens I feel completely relaxed, calm, happy, accepting of death etc. Euphoric basically. Man I am repeating myself now. Anywho, usually after an hour of feeling euphoric, thoughts of doubt and uncertainty creep in again. Primarily thoughts such as; ''What if the feelings of wanting to become a woman leave???, I don't want it to leave!!!'' \nThe worst part of thoughts like that is that I don't know if it originates from the right place or the wrong place inside of me. Is it the social construct me that is clinging onto its last breaths or is it &gt;me&lt; telling me that I am not actually a woman, even though a rather powerful feeling inside of me is telling me I am.\n\nHopefully I've given a pretty clear view of how things are now. That way I can tell you about how I got to this point my ''Origins'' story if you want to put it like that.\n\nSince a couple of months ago I got into sissy hypnos. It was a bit of an on and off relationship. Sometimes I'd watch and regret watching it afterwards and other times I would have periods during which I didn't touch the genre at all, but my fap interests were always specifically centered around TG (SIDENOTE: ''Played quite a bit of Trap Quest'') and some very obscure fetish. before I ever found out about sissyhypnos I would occasionally cross-dress, but that would only happen when I had refrained from fapping for 4 days to 2 weeks. SIDENOTE: ''I specifically remember that I enjoyed feeling pretty while doing so.'' Anyway, please know that I've given that bit of background information so I can get to the important part, which was the last 4 weeks up until now. 4 weeks ago I decided to start nofap/no porn (For the most part noporn) my main motivation being the whole Opioid/Dopamine system rewiring your brain article which I read about on a nofap site (Don't want to go back there, it makes me feel negative) I read it because I was fapping to some weird shit, so I thought that a 3 month nofap would definitely rewire my brain to its natural state. But when my Ergonomics doctor, who I went to regarding my RSI, told me that I cannot game for the next 2 weeks (Or stress my right arm at all for that matter.) During those 2 weeks I had Holiday. So, I thought; ''No Gaming during my vacation? Fuck, I'm going to relapse.'' And that's exactly what happened. I relapsed on the very first fucking saturday even. Didn't even regret it for a bit afterwards. On that following Monday however I purged. SIDENOTE: ''In the sense of deleting all the content/browser history and regretting my relapse a bit.'' This after purge purity continued until Wednesday when my mind pulled me back and brilliantly decided to start considering to involve weed into the equation. Absolutely no stopping my desires for this experimentation I got me some money and bought me some quality weed with a friend of mine. He smoked a bit of the stash with me. He is completely ignorant regarding my motive etc. (SIDENOTE: ''He was there Friday to sunday'') during which I strangely had gay fantasies about him. (BIG SIDENOTE: ''Remember, that what I just said was last week. FYI Timelines can be a little fucked up because I always binged on hypnos/audios during the following nights. My brain's a little hazy regarding times. + On that sunday I decided to finally start strictly following the sissy feminization program I found online somewhere'') \nAfter those days I used the remaining part of the stash to get high while watching hypnos and listening to feminization audio files.

2016-05-07 14:20:49,4ia5a6,0,11,"So this post will go up on my blog soon, but I like to share directly to this subbreddit as you guys were the inspiration for everything I've achieved in my transition journey. So here it is:

So this week marks one year since I publicly came out as trans and started my hormone transition. So I would like to wish my girl side a very happy first birthday! (She has always been the younger one it would seem). I thought I would celebrate by sharing some reflections on my experience. After all, coming out as transgender certainly isn’t something most people get to do in a lifetime!
 
It goes without saying that everyone’s coming out story is unique. I feel almost slightly shameful to admit that with all things considered, I have had it very easy. My experience was overwhelmingly smooth and positive, which I owe entirely to how beautiful the people in my life are. It felt like it only took a few words and overnight every one of my friends, family and work colleagues embraced my new gender identity, pronouns and name without question. I was completely caught off guard that overnight I would become a female in most people’s eyes and those who hadn’t processed the jump, put in every effort they could to make it happen. I know a lot of these people will be reading this post, so I would like to take the opportunity to express how grateful I am and how much love I have for every one of you.

Unfortunately, a major portion of people who go through this change aren't so lucky. Unlike them, I will never have to experience being disowned by my family or have all of my friends walk away from me. I will never experience violence being turned against me by the very people I love. I will never experience losing my job solely because of my gender identity. I will never experience being homeless simply for living my own life. I will never have to sell my body just to stay alive. I will never ride the dark, downward spiral of self-abuse and suicide that is an all too frequent destination for many gender non-conforming people. (A massive touch wood on all of the above)

It would seem pretty surreal to imagine that this could be possible in the modern world, but sadly I have met a lot of people who have lived through some aspect of this experience. It’s even more painful to process that there is one person I had befriended in the last year who is sadly no longer alive.

When I came out, I did it with a full acceptance that something horrible could happen to me. I didn’t have any reason to believe it would, after all everyone in my life is pretty rad, but I had heard a lot of horror stories from people who thought they were in a similar situation. At the time when I finally announced publicly that I wasn’t like “100% a dude”, I have never honest-to-god been more terrified in my life. I have nearly drowned while surfing, I have come within fifteen meters of a tiger shark, I have nearly collided mid-air while skydiving and not to mention how many times I’ve nearly set myself on fire or blown my hands off during my pyromaniac pre-teen years. All that and the thought of saying a few words had me completely shitting in my pants.

All I can say without going into extreme detail (which I will soon) is that I took the leap, because I knew in my heart that my life would be fake and wasted if I didn’t at least try. Life is way too short to not live in a way that feels natural and allows you to express yourself freely. The people around you are really missing out if they don’t get the full package and by stepping out from the same-old-same-old you encourage others to try the things that they’ve always wanted to do.

I think we are actually entering a very fortunate time in human history, with the way technology and social media platforms are rapidly connecting people with others outside of their bubbles. It isn’t hard these days for any fish out of water to look online and realise there is a whole ocean of fish out there. I know I owe a lot of my journey of self-acceptance to the likes of YouTube, Tumblr and Reddit. It would seem that with this greater human connection we are seeing a growing respect for a person’s right to self-determination and we are in a more supportive place than ever to try something new.

So one year ago I came out as trans and it turns out that my gut was right, the people in my life are pretty rad.

Did you have to get cosmetic surgery?

2016-05-09 00:29:47,4ih5l3,8,0,"Reading a few posts here makes me shake my head.  I guess people can label themselves however they want to, but they cannot force other people to abide by their labeling.  

That's my first annoyance with all these millennial terms being printed.  My second annoyance is with the concept of choice when it comes to gender.  You certainly can choose how you label yourself, and how you live your life.   But you don't get to redefine words to inject the concept of choice into a word that denies it traditionally.  That requires a new word.

What people want to be, male/female/other is composed of a few components.  The first is physical.  The second is... culture.  The role, behavior, mindset, expectation, self-awareness of gender is cultural.  A human raised by a strange otherwordly species of aliens with no concept of gender would not have gender either, outside of the physical parts.

Oh, but what of the longings, you ask?  Well some longings are cultural like how to dress and walk and even move your eyes, but I assume the one part left out so far is sex, love, non-familial affection.  Unfortunately, you can't have acceptance of homosexual desires and the belief that longings are part of gender identity.  It's not a consistent belief.  You can't say a gay man is actually a woman with a man's parts, but that's what you are saying if you want longings to be part of gender identity.

Culture, and physical.  There's nothing else.  Therefore there's no such thing as non-binary, because neither of these two sources of the actual word gender understands anything other than male or female (with some genetically accidental situations added in there of course, as with anything reliant on genetic code).

The number of concepts and lingo that have been invented in order to make sure everyone is labeled in a niche way as opposed to being part of a large group, and the temptation to believe oneself as transcendent of the masses, is a bridge too far.  There is beauty in simplicity.  Truth there too.  We invent drama, not science or reason.

 [This](http://www.wikihow.com/Look-Androgynous) says:
&gt; Avoid wearing soft and powdery colors like they're the plague. But you don't always have to wear bold, dark colors like black. Other colors can be neutral such as navy blue, forest green, brown, and black. Camouflage is a good pattern to stick with. 


However, I am unsure of if this is targeted towards everyone, or just FAABs.


I think I recall reading that it is best that that transwomen wear bright colors, which suggests that bright colors would increase androgyny for MAABs. Furthermore, females seem to wear brighter colors more often than males due, which also suggests that bright colors would increase androgyny for MAABs and decrease it for FAABs. Bright colors seem to grab attention, so if the clothing is more androgynous than the rest of the individual, this could increase androgyny for FAABs and MAABs.

However, bright colors seem to make busts or lack thereof more obvious, which could decrease androgyny.

Advice would be greatly appreciated.

I'm American and have Medicaid, which in my state now covers trans related surgeries. Last year in the summer, I had a consult with a doctor for a vaginoplasty I was told it would happen within 3-6 months. Well, after being delayed multiple times, here we are in May and it hasn't happened. As of a couple weeks ago, the status was that they are backed up and are referring people to another doctor. I'm now on a waiting list for a consult with that doctor, which they claim will happen late summer (I'll believe that when I see it).

Good part at least is that the urologist, who was supposed to work with the plastic surgeon, was able to get me in for an orchiectomy, so I got that at least.

Last week, I found a doctor who would be willing to do a plain penectomy with no accompanying vaginoplasty, and he said he has an opening in a couple months. He doesn't take insurance though— cash only. It's significantly cheaper than the other procedure, but still several thousand dollars. 

Anyway, here comes my dilemma. Having a vagina was never as important for me as *not* having a penis. In fact, I never particularly wanted the vaginoplasty at all; it was just a means to an end.

Do I get nullification, which would be more desirable and sooner, but cost more, or vaginoplasty, which would be less desirable and in an uncertain timeframe, but is free? On a scale of desirability, penectomy would be at the top, vaginoplasty in the middle, and doing nothing way down at the bottom.

I'm not asking people to choose for me; I just want to talk to anyone that gets it. I have a few trans friends, but they are all mono gender and don't get the appeal of nullifcation, and everyone else in my life is not any type of queer and can't relate to this kind of surgery in the slightest.

The stories I'm finding online tend to be by cis gay men. That's great for them, but it's not the same, even if the procedure is.

Necklines affect androgyny in two ways: by being stereotypically associated with a gender and by downplaying or emphasizing masculine or feminine features. 


The necklines associated with females are generally ones that reveal more skin, which suggests that crew necks would be bad for AMABs and bad for AFABs.


As for downplaying or emphasizing features, boat necks [can](http://www.realsimple.com/beauty-fashion/clothing/sweaters-tops/neckline) make broad shoulders look broader, but can ""offset"" wide hips. They are also typically associated with females, so these would probably be bad for both AFABs and AMABs.

Scoop-necks are bad for broad shoulders as well, but also emphasize ""a round, full face,"" suggesting they are bad for both AFABs and AMABs.

Turtle-necks [can](http://sillytranswoman.blogspot.com/2014/01/how-to-minimize-broad-shoulders.html?m=1) look very masculine, and could also hide a thin neck.

V-necks [can](http://www.teluguone.com/vanitha/content/right-neckline-for-your-body-71-23230.html) [help](https://www.seeitbagit.com/blogs/online-shoppers-magazine/39027393-how-to-pick-the-right-neckline-to-suit-you) with a thick neck, broad shoulders and a thick torso. However, v-necks [make](http://stylecaster.com/fashion-tips-to-make-you-look-taller/#slide-14) torsos appear longer.

Looser, more draped cowl-necks [can](http://sillytranswoman.blogspot.com/2014/01/how-to-minimize-broad-shoulders.html?m=1) have the same effect as v-necks do, and [can](http://www.realsimple.com/beauty-fashion/clothing/sweaters-tops/neckline) also add bulk to the chest, which helps deal with small busts. They [are](http://www.thefashionpolice.net/2010/08/style-on-trial-cowl-necks-for-men.html) also very rarely worn by men.

2016-05-15 00:25:19,4jduzq,4,8,"So I am AFAB, and have always been attracted to females. When I was first starting to get butterflies for my friends in kindergarten, I thought maybe I should have been a boy and that ""God"" messed up (though my parents are very secular, everyone else in my family is very serious about being Southern Baptist.. I went to a Christian private school in MS from preschool to 5th grade so i was slightly indoctrinated until about 3rd grade when I started asking too many questions). Every ""pretending"" game, I was a boy. Hated ANYTHING typically gendered towards girls. Never owned a barbie or anything pink or purple. I actually told my aunt that ""it hurts me"" to wear a dress. 

In my 8th grade year we moved from rural MS to the capital, so I was exposed to much more liberal culture and friends. I quickly and very solidly identified as lesbian at this point but still wore my hair long and tried *usually in vain* to find girls pants that would fit the way I liked. I never knew what to do with my breasts. I've wished they weren't there since they came in and was in denial for a while until I was pulled aside and given the ""you _gotta_ get a bra"" talk. It's been sports bras ever since.
I still just didn't feel ... authentic.

Fast forward to today. Now that I'm coming up on 25 and having been in a committed relationship with the woman of my dreams for 6 years, my understanding of my sexuality has been much more rounded out. There is still one thing I grappled with and I suppose this recent bathroom controversy has brought it all to a head. My chest disphoria got MUCH worse recently.
I've never quite opened up about my gender identity issues to my gf. She has always known that I swoon when she calls me ""handsome"" instead of ""pretty"" and that I wear men's clothes (except those damn sports bras), and take on the masculine gender roles in our relationship 95% of the time. I suppose I didn't say anything because I didn't really understand it myself.
I finally told her that I hate my breasts and want to bind.. but that I am pretty certain I would never want to have surgery or hormone therapy and I also prefer female pronouns, though I don't feel upset when accidentally misgendered. Sensing my confusion she suggested I look into genderqueer.

.. I've never felt so genuine, accepted, and ""normal"" in my life. I was like ""There are more people like me!!!"" I love how broad the category can be because it leaves room for me to keep figuring all this out.

And by the way. My gf took me shopping for sports bras and undershirts last week and helped me look up exercises to get these beasts under control. I am so grateful to her for showing me this community and embracing this change. She has now taken to calling me only masculine compliments and makes me feel amazing every day.

There is still one thing I grappled with and I suppose this recent bathroom controversy has brought it all to a head. My chest disphoria got MUCH worse recently.\nI\'ve never quite opened up about my gender identity issues to my gf. She has always known that I swoon when she calls me ""handsome"" instead of ""pretty"" and that I wear men\'s clothes (except those damn sports bras), and take on the masculine gender roles in our relationship 95% of the time. I suppose I didn\'t say anything because I didn\'t really understand it myself.\nI finally told her that I hate my breasts and want to bind.. but that I am pretty certain I would never want to have surgery or hormone therapy and I also prefer female pronouns, though I don\'t feel upset when accidentally misgendered. Sensing my confusion she suggested I look into genderqueer.\n\n.. I\'ve never felt so genuine, accepted, and ""normal"" in my life. I was like ""There are more people like me!!!"" I love how broad the category can be because it leaves room for me to keep figuring all this out.\n\nAnd by the way. My gf took me shopping for sports bras and undershirts last week and helped me look up exercises to get these beasts under control. I am so grateful to her for showing me this community and embracing this change. She has now taken to calling me only masculine compliments and makes me feel amazing every day.\n\nI guess I just wanted to post to see if any one else has stories similar or if you just wanted to share how you came to find out about genderqueer and what it means.\n\n And to say: ""hi everyone, thanks for being so open.""', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Recently started exploring my identity as genderqueer', 'created': 1463297119.0}"

2016-05-16 18:09:16,4jmflv,10,7,"I was born female, and was always pretty gender neutral. My mother seems to prefer boys over girls and will always make them out to be the 'heroes' in a sense, as if they could do no wrong. 
I was also raised in a VERY Christian household where gay and anything different sexually was wrong. ( Which is funny because my mother and father are also extremely 'fluid'. My mom is very masculine and many people have mistaken her for a lesbian and my dad is more feminine and somewhat flamboyant.) 
I enjoyed hanging out with girls and boys, and was interested in both male and female activities. I played barbies into my early teens and always insisted on being the male character, I felt sexier and more powerful in that role. I would also play games with my girlfriends and be the boy character, and eventually began sleeping with my girlfriends in this male mindset. (This next part may sound weird, I believe it went this way because of how sheltered my living situation was.) 

This boy character from barbies, to 'playing' with my friends..almost became a second entity. A natural one of course, it was me. Just me as a male, and everything I wanted to be. (I would bind my breasts and wear boys clothes, which i still do. I shop in the boys section and feel much more confident in that style.) I started dating a girl I met at camp at 16, though never once thought of myself as a lesbian, it was in my head and hers, a straight male/female relationship. (I had been with boys too, and then and into my early 20's when I slept with males I felt I was a boy, sleeping with a boy) I would be a 'boy' around her and often fantasize about my life as him at home, writing about it and talking with close friends about it. Around my family I had to be a girl, which also came naturally. But I felt they were missing a piece of me. When we broke up after about 7 months I took it extremely hard and felt as though I lost myself.  

Like the 'boy' could no longer be without a girl there to see him. I dated other people, hooked up with other girls and guys along the way. I was very, very confused but pushed it under the rug, only acknowledging this boy as a game, or a fantasy. I began dating my best girl friend from childhood, and fell head over heels in love. (Mostly in my 'boy' role, which enables my confidence to seduce and feel attractive. She was actually the one who encouraged me to embrace him, and helped me understand who 'he' was, and how I felt.) 

We dated secretly, as I had with all the other girls I had been with, for about a year. I was about to turn 21 and was finishing up my degree, and after planning to move to NYC. The night before I was supposed to move, we were caught together by my mom. She was somehow aware of this boy I was emoting and she told me 'he' was not real and I had to stop. That night I broke up with the love of my life and went to NYC the next morning completely numb and heart broken...And traumatized.

 I moved in with a male roommate and began a strictly sexual relationship with him, I was desperately depending on him to make me not...whatever I was. 'Gay'.. as my mom would describe it. That relationship didn't work out and about a year later I moved back home. I reunited with my ex, in shambles, and we went through some very difficult transitional periods. (Me denying not only my sexuality, but almost ashamed of myself, and who was in every sense) As we got older and dated longer, I felt more open to be both male and female with her day to day. *Intimately I am strictly male. I view sex as a male, and feel as if I have male sexual organs and tendencies. Sex is also 'straight' for a lack of a better word. I enjoy being treated like a boy, and spoken to like a boy 100% of the time when intimate. 

In the past few years I have had ups and downs from panicking about my mom which at one point caused me to turn back to men to try to be 'straight'. I have sobbed on the kitchen floor from the brutal realization I will never 'grow up' to be the man I was striving to be. (When I think of the future with my girlfriend I see myself as a man with a wife and kids) I would often throw up because the whole process was terrifying.

Here is my biggest concern:

I feel bad/concerned for my girlfriend because I feel my perception and view on myself is constantly changing...There will be days I feel like I am a man, trapped in a woman's body, if I had the option to TRULY transition I would. I have days where I am no gender, I have days where I go back and forth from man to woman. I have days where I convince not only my girlfriend but MYSELF that I have never felt I am male, or want to be male. That I am just a confused girl...

I have days where I am fearful my girlfriend prefers my male side and that's not who I am. There are times where I only want her to like my male side, and treat me like I am a boy, only. There are days where I am feeling more feminine and want to be babied, and there are days I want to dress up and wear a little make up. (rare, but it happens) There are also times I do my makeup to be more angular and masculine. (I am androgynous, and have modeled for male and female photos) There are days where if I'm treated as a woman I feel upset and uncomfortable, and pray I could be a boy..I even want my children to call me ""Tayta"" Which means ""Father"" in a different language.. Every time someone sees me and my girlfriend and refers to us as 'girls' I cringe.. Because I don't like to be labeled or put in a box. Sometimes I wonder if I only want to be a boy because of how my mother views them, other times I know I do because that's how I see myself and how i feel. At times I speak in a lower voice, especially around my girlfriend and good friends, others I have my normal feminine voice. 

My male side, is me, and my feminine side is me. They can be intertwined, or completely separated. My feminine side usually happens throughout the day in blips, or when I'm extremely sensitive. They both are constants however, I never go a day without a moment of male and female tendencies. 

 I have such panic over it at times I began taking over the counter testosterone boosters to help. Which they did until my parents found them, that incident bringing back a lot of trauma and bad memories. I stopped taking it, and have been feeling really guilty and that feeling of shame. (It's been 5 weeks since I stopped and I have noticed this struggle is becoming a prominent issue again.)

When I'm dreaming I am usually male, though sometimes a female. Sometimes I switch back and forth and sometimes I'm neither sex. I refuse to label myself, even as genderqueer, though my girlfriend will sometimes mention it when I'm being irrational. And I don't like it, because I don't want to be trapped by a gender identity. I understand she just wants to understand what I am going through, and I make it very hard to figure that out. Even for myself.
 
 I do feel bad for her and understand her confusion because I am all over the place at times... I will convince her I'm a man trapped in a woman's body 75% of the time, and then the next day I'm saying none of what I said before is true and I'm just a girl who is very confused. A girl who looks up to men and wishes she could be like them, to avoid societies views on women. I am a girl who is happy to be a girl, like me as a girl.
And then once again, within an hour, or a day, I am feeling male and want to be viewed as such. (??)
I want her to call me her boy, or boyfriend. I want to be called by a more masculine nick name. I want to be her man. I want her to say things to me, she would say to a man. 

It goes back and forth. *She often says it happens a few weeks before I get my period ( when I'm fertile) I become more sensitive and feminine, and I feel extremely unattractive and insecure in myself.
I am constantly saying I don't know who I am, and I don't know how I feel about myself. Which I'm sure is scary for my girlfriend...(I know I'm in love with her and want to be with her, and her only. I just don't know whats going on inside me.)

She says its hard because I'm always back and forth about my gender. Which she wouldn't mind if I wasn't so bothered by the whole thing. And also that I change my story and opinion so often.
 For example: If I'm in a more feminine mindset or neutral, and I start questioning the male, and she begins indulging in my male side, I become protective of my female side.
There have been times in my life I feel completely myself, and the male and female kinda squish together and I'm just me. 

I come off almost as gender fluid, androgynous. And I'm comfortable that way. 
But there is a huge difference between the 'personalities' at times. And I can't seem to stay one way. I can't control it. If I could, I would want to stay 'boy' forever. 
But we all change..
I am thinking about proposing..and thinking about having children also concerns me because of my personality changes. The way it's going I believe they will think they have three parents...Their mom, their other mom and their dad. 
What do you think this is?

Am I gender queer? Am I bigender? Am I gender fluid? Am I crazy? haha. How can I help this situation for myself? 
Is there a way to maintain a personality? Or will it constantly change?
If anyone older has experienced this, does it balance out? Or will I always feel completely back and forth and out of control of myself?

Thanks for reading, hope this makes sense. (I wrote this quickly, sorry for any errors.)
I'm sincerely looking forward to some opinions, advice and hopefully answers.

You know, I truly can't fault anyone for simply misgendering me. I get it, I wear my hair short, I carry myself in a masculine way, and every stitch of clothing I have comes from the men's section. Our brains want to make patterns and take shortcuts and that's ok. We are hardwired to do that. I actively do a lot of things to put a kink in people's binary views of gender just by acting and dressing like myself.

What did upset me was that there was literally NO ONE else in the store or parking lot, I was washing my hands to finish up, and they still felt the need to call out across the entire store ""SIR, YOU'RE IN THE WRONG BATHROOM!""
Of course when I said, ""I'M FEMALE!"" They apologized.. but what if they hadn't taken my word for it? What would they have done? Also who the hell was I hurting even if I WAS in the ""wrong"" bathroom? The store was empty!

Bullet points here because I don’t have the energy to make this a cohesive paragraph, but its all related in some way to my gender identity issues. Sorry this is 8 years long, but I always want people to know 100%.

Simple summary is that I don’t know if I’m just a confused cis girl with serious penis envy, or in some way trans. I’m really not that physically uncomfortable in my body, and don’t have a pronoun preference. I’m lazy and don’t want to fight for change and acceptance of nonbinary genders because I feel like they will never fit properly into our society. And if I am trans, I wouldn’t want to medically transition because it’s too hard/complex. But if I didn’t transition I would never pass and life would be endless discrimination. How should I live my life in a way that won’t cause much judgement/discrimination for my gender identity, and make me the happiest? (Yeah, you obviously won’t know what makes me happy, but what are your opinions?)

*Disclaimer that this post is 98% my opinions and I hope you can respect that and not flame me for them. I’m not trying to discredit transguys here in any way whatsoever.*

First, some of my opinions on gender, society, and pronouns

Gender and sex are different things. Sex is your chromosomes/biology and there is male, female, and intersex. Gender is boy, girl, and non-binary/a ton of other stuff.

Being non-binary in society is very hard and stressful because our society was built around 2 sexs/genders.

“Tumblrinas”, extreme SJW’s, and special snowflakes are treated like a joke in the majority of the “real world” and I don’t want to been seen like that because it can affect employment 
and serious stuff.

I’m hesitant to publicly use labels like “genderqueer” and such, for the above reasons.

I don’t really have much preference for pronouns, but again, in society using singular “they” is a challenge for some people and I don’t want to be seen as a special snowflake.

I understand that you should “be the change you want to see” but frankly, I’m lazy. I also really don’t like to be the odd person out trying to break the mold when it comes to LGBT+ stuff in daily society. 


Stuff about me personally

I’m a very scientific person and prefer logic and scientific fact above opinion and feelings.

I was born and raised female, and have XX chromosomes.

The only thing I’m 100% sure of in regards to gender/sexuality is that I’m sexually attracted to men. I generally just say bisexual though, because I think I’m romantically attracted to women and it’s easier.

Anal sex is terrifying to me and I would never do it/hate reading about it. Similar thoughts apply to oral sex on women. Vaginas kinda gross me out. (So this kind of rules out being a gay man in a relationship with gay cis men)

I don’t know if I’m sexually attracted to men, or just penises.

I’ve never actually had sex/a real romantic relationship, so take some of this with a grain of salt.

I’m don’t really get physical gender dysphoria. More of just gender confusion. I’m relatively comfortable in my body, besides the regular qualms like “my butt is too flat”


My history

I was a super tomboy as a kid and wore all boys clothes and did mostly boys hobbies

I was always really excited when people would “misgender” me as a boy, but I hid it from my parents because they teased me about it.

My parents were pretty cool with the boys clothes and stuff. They teased me a bit but they were generally supportive and let me do what I wanted without much restraint.

I remember praying in church that I hoped I would wake up with a penis one day.

I would always feel super awkward when at school they would have you separated into boys and girls groups, because I felt like I was the odd looking one out on the girls side. I wouldn’t want to go on the boys side either because I didn’t fit in there either and was afraid of being “called out” I guess.

Saying I wanted to be a boy was always my ""deep, dark secret"" as a kid that I probably only told my very close friends about. Never my family.

I was a tomboy until I was about 12.

I stopped dressing like a boy because I started to be sexually attracted to men, and realised the only way to attract them was to be girly

It’s been 7 years and men have never been interested in me. I’ve sort of given up. I assume they don’t like me because I’m not proper girly enough.


Some thoughts on medically transitioning

I realised being trans was a thing when I was maybe 15? I found youtube videos trans guys made and I got really excited because I felt like other people finally understood my yearnings as a kid, and there was something you could do about it.

I have no idea if I want to medically transition or not. Again, I’m really lazy and don’t really want to deal with all the costs, stigmas, time and energy it takes.

I don’t want to be a transsexual man. I want to be a cis male. I want an actual male XY chromosome body, and a working penis and such, not a prosthetic. Obviously this is impossible, so why would I bother with a transition if it will never be what I really want? (No offence is meant to trans guys here. If what you have works for you thats great! I just don’t know what I should pursue)

My anxiety/panic attacks almost always come from weird physical sensations, and since doctors generally don’t know everything about what side effects hormone treatment/testosterone has, I would have a bad time with all the changes testosterone gives you.

My talking voice would probably never pass, but I don’t really want to change it because I do a lot of singing and love being a soprano

My chest is big and binders don’t work very well because of it. I’m also super skinny and mens trousers never fit quite right on my twig legs. But on the flip side, female trousers are always sagy on my flat butt.

I live between the UK and USA so legally changing documents would be a mess and could jeopardise my visa.


Questions I have that I hope you can answer

I have no idea how to label myself and its stressing me out. How would you label me? 
Some things I’ve kinda identified with are genderqueer, non-binary, transmasculine, tomboy, and demiboy. Which of these (or others) do you think are the most accepted in everyday society?

Will I always be upset the whole rest of my life that I don’t have a real penis? Because that’s what it’s been like for pretty much my whole life in the past.

Do you think I should go to a gender counselor/doctor about this (since it is kinda consuming me) or should I be realistic and just be a female who dresses kinda androgynous?

Maybe just agender because let's be real, at the end of the day I’m a homosapien like everyone else.

Um, so I'm afab and have only started coming out genderqueer in the past few months. It's been kind of rough (lots of anxiety, nightmares, dysphoria, internalized transphobia, etc.) but so far my people (sister, best friend, boyfriend) have been really sweet and accepting and lovely. I found a gender-non-conforming support group in my area and am trying to make some friends volunteering with a very trans-friendly organization.

The problem is negotiating this in the context of a committed relationship with my very straight boyfriend of 2+ years. He's super sweet and wonderful in every way: financially supporting me through grad school, being great around my mental health stuff, and just being the most generous and kind person I've ever met. We're really in love, living together and planning to get engaged in the near future.

And when I first came out he was really great, saying that he loved me, offering to let me borrow his clothes, and saying that even if I didn't fit in the gender binary I fit with him :) After some conversation we (I thought) agreed that basically as long as I'm not a trans man (I'm not, I'm non-binary) we could stay together and it would be fine...

Except it's not fine? I was asking him to not call me a girl/woman so often and he was asking what I'd prefer. I suggested gender neutral stuff but also asked if he would consider using mixed gender language (calling me a girl sometimes and a boy othertimes) as that's really what I'm happiest with. And he just looked at me in this panic, said that he was really uncomfortable with it, basically begged me not to ask him to call me a boy. Which of course I said he didn't have to. He did agree to be better about using gender neutral language and seems to be happiest thinking of me as just a unique sort of being, almost beyond gender entirely.

But now I'm just feeling super sad and insecure and even more worried that he still just thinks of me as a very confused girl who likes to wear masculine clothing sometimes. I love him and know he is doing the best he can but it's still really hard to do this. 

Does anyone know if partners can get more comfortable with this over time? Or if its possible to er, shift one's gender identity into a slightly more reasonable shape (not cis, just more agender/genderless instead of the weird bigender thing I seem to have right now)?

2016-05-27 18:47:50,4lc7io,2,6,"I'm AMAB and genderqueer.  I don't experience much body dysphoria and I never objected much to being called male pronouns (although I now prefer they/them), and although I do prefer to wear a mix of women's and men's clothing, I feel pretty comfortable in men's clothing, and wore almost only men's clothing for years because it was what I was used to.

The strongest disconnects I've experience with gender, though, have been with my sexuality.   I have a great deal of shame and negativity associated with my sexuality and I have decided that this year I want to work on breaking it down.  (Last year I ""came out"" as nonbinary in the sense of being more open about my identity and also changing how I dress and present much of the time, to bring my appearance more into harmony with my identity.)

Sexuality-wise, I'm mostly attracted to women, and have only dated women and one female-presenting nonbinary AMAB person.  But I feel like my sexuality is super different from that of a typical straight male.  I have a certain affinity with lesbian culture and identity.  People sometimes mistake me for a lesbian when I talk about my relationships online, and I often find more appeal in how lesbians talk about women than how men do.

I feel a strong desire for symmetry and equality in romantic and sexual relationships, and I'd ideally like my relationships to be as free from gender norms as possible.  But because I'm AMAB and don't want to hide that or change my body, I am perceived and treated as male by most people.  Sexuality seems strongly gendered in our society, and I often feel forced into roles and constrained by constraints that cause me great discomfort.  These include:

* The expectation or norm for men to initiate sexual or romantic relationships or interactions most of the time.  I find that if I relax and engage with people in a way that feels most natural to me, it usually leads to me having very few or no romantic or sexual connections most of the time.  This causes me a lot of discomfort, because having sexual and romantic relationships is important to me, and thus I feel forced by this situation, into playing more of the role of active pursuer or initiator than feels comfortable or right for me: I'd ideally like for things to be highly mutual / balanced or only slightly different one way or the other.  I'd like for women to pursue me / initiate things with me maybe at least a third of the time, especially when it comes to things like initiating get-togethers, initiating conversations, or pushing conversations or relationships to a deeper level of intimacy.  I start feeling profoundly uncomfortable when I'm always the one to push the relationships to the next level, yet I find that because of gender roles and socialization, I often *need* to do this or my relationships don't ever develop in the directions that I want.
* Living in a cultural framework for men expressing attraction to women, that doesn't work for me or feel comfortable to me.  People have told me that the language I use to talk about women seems pretty disjoint from the language most men use to express attraction.  For example I almost never use the terms ""sexy"" or ""hot"" and when I do it is usually to refer to something intellectual that someone did.  (Like if I see someone that I find attractive, browsing the stacks in the library in a section that I find interesting, I might describe that as ""hot"".)  If I find someone really attractive I'll usually describe them as ""cute"", ""super cute"", or ""adorable"".  Women routinely have not noticed that I was interested in / attracted to them until I was extremely direct or explicit about it, and then have expressed great surprise...but conversely I've also had women numerous times think I was interested in them when I'm not.  I think of myself as a fairly open and direct communicator and I think there are some deeper reasons for this disconnect.  Another thing, women frequently tell me that they initially thought I was gay because of my mannerisms and ways of interacting with women.
* Being perceived as a predator or threat, and having women perceive or respond to my expressions of interest in them as if it were an imposition on them.  This is especially a huge insecurity for me because I tend to be attracted mostly to women who are significantly younger than me (i'm 35 and my last long-term relationship was with someone 8 years younger, which is an age difference I felt very comfy with, but it makes me cautious with new people because of the tendency to perceive older men as predators).  I also find this really frustrating because for me, I experience attraction primarily as like, a sense of appreciation and admiration of a person, like I find the person's presence comforting and I want to be around them more, enjoy being around them more, and I find myself caring about them more, and I care hugely about respecting boundaries.  I've found though that women's expressions of boundaries can involve poor, ambiguous, or absent communication.  I also used to struggle a lot with social awkwardness (especially when I was younger I would sometimes come across as someone on the autism spectrum, although I always test as not being on that spectrum) and used to have a lot of trouble reading people (and still have a lot of trouble when I'm nervous and/or depressed), which may factor into this too.  I've had numerous experiences where women have criticized me or reacted in ways that seemed extreme, in response to me expressing interest in them in ways that I all of my female friends have agreed to be perfectly respectful.  I think most straight guys seem to shrug off these experiences easily, but I feel very sensitive and I've unfortunately let them get to me and contribute to me feeling super ashamed of my sexuality.  I'm not always sure how to respond to or process situations when this happens.
* Sometimes I wonder if there is a disconnect between how I respond to women's appearance and how they want men to.  For example, I find high heels and bold makeup to be a strong turnoff, but the cultural consensus seems to be that this is associated with women having sex appeal.  I feel really attracted to women who aren't visibly wearing makeup and who are dressed in very comfortable clothing.  Like when I think of the times I've found women most attractive, they've often been wearing pajamas, gym clothing, or very simple casual clothing.  It's really common that when I've given women compliments on their appearance they've responded by surprise telling me that I complimented them when they felt like they were looking at their worst / frumpiest.  I notice that when a lot of women put more care into their appearance I start feeling less comfortable around them and less attracted to them and I think this may relate to my desire for symmetry--I don't want to have a partner that puts a lot more effort into their appearance than I do, because I want us to have symmetry in how we think / feel about each other's appearance and bodies, if that makes sense?  I feel like this seems to cut me off from a lot of women though...I don't know.  And often when I've opened up about these things when dating people it's come across poorly, like I'm trying to police or control the other person's appearance, which is not what I want...but at the same time it is a constraint that strongly influences my attraction to another person, and it relates to the dynamic in a relationship that I want to have, and I'm not sure how to navigate it.

So I think all of these things contribute to me spending most of my time sort of floundering around when it comes to sex and romance.

I have like, a very rich social life.  I am very outgoing and make friends very easily, I have numerous close relationships.  I have several friends that I feel strongly attracted to and many more friends that I feel moderately attracted to.

But I feel really uncomfortable navigating the romantic or sexual aspects of a relationship, especially in the early stages.  (Once I'm dating someone a lot of these issues fade away.)  I feel like all the burden is usually placed on me to push relationships in this direction, but I don't know how to do that gracefully and in a way that feels comfortable and right to me.

Thanks in advance!",genderqueer,Dealing With Disconnects About Sexuality: Not Sure How To Proceed,1464400070.0,"{'created_utc': 1464374870, 'id': '4lc7io', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 6, 'selftext': 'I\'m AMAB and genderqueer.  I don\'t experience much body dysphoria and I never objected much to being called male pronouns (although I now prefer they/them), and although I do prefer to wear a mix of women\'s and men\'s clothing, I feel pretty comfortable in men\'s clothing, and wore almost only men\'s clothing for years because it was what I was used to.\n\nThe strongest disconnects I\'ve experience with gender, though, have been with my sexuality.   I have a great deal of shame and negativity associated with my sexuality and I have decided that this year I want to work on breaking it down.  (Last year I ""came out"" as nonbinary in the sense of being more open about my identity and also changing how I dress and present much of the time, to bring my appearance more into harmony with my identity.)\n\nSexuality-wise, I\'m mostly attracted to women, and have only dated women and one female-presenting nonbinary AMAB person.  But I feel like my sexuality is super different from that of a typical straight male.  I have a certain affinity with lesbian culture and identity.  People sometimes mistake me for a lesbian when I talk about my relationships online, and I often find more appeal in how lesbians talk about women than how men do.\n\nI feel a strong desire for symmetry and equality in romantic and sexual relationships, and I\'d ideally like my relationships to be as free from gender norms as possible.  But because I\'m AMAB and don\'t want to hide that or change my body, I am perceived and treated as male by most people.  Sexuality seems strongly gendered in our society, and I often feel forced into roles and constrained by constraints that cause me great discomfort.  These include:\n\n* The expectation or norm for men to initiate sexual or romantic relationships or interactions most of the time.  I find that if I relax and engage with people in a way that feels most natural to me, it usually leads to me having very few or no romantic or sexual connections most of the time.  This causes me a lot of discomfort, because having sexual and romantic relationships is important to me, and thus I feel forced by this situation, into playing more of the role of active pursuer or initiator than feels comfortable or right for me: I\'d ideally like for things to be highly mutual / balanced or only slightly different one way or the other.  I\'d like for women to pursue me / initiate things with me maybe at least a third of the time, especially when it comes to things like initiating get-togethers, initiating conversations, or pushing conversations or relationships to a deeper level of intimacy.  I start feeling profoundly uncomfortable when I\'m always the one to push the relationships to the next level, yet I find that because of gender roles and socialization, I often *need* to do this or my relationships don\'t ever develop in the directions that I want.\n* Living in a cultural framework for men expressing attraction to women, that doesn\'t work for me or feel comfortable to me.  People have told me that the language I use to talk about women seems pretty disjoint from the language most men use to express attraction.  For example I almost never use the terms ""sexy"" or ""hot"" and when I do it is usually to refer to something intellectual that someone did.  (Like if I see someone that I find attractive, browsing the stacks in the library in a section that I find interesting, I might describe that as ""hot"".)  If I find someone really attractive I\'ll usually describe them as ""cute"", ""super cute"", or ""adorable"".  Women routinely have not noticed that I was interested in / attracted to them until I was extremely direct or explicit about it, and then have expressed great surprise...but conversely I\'ve also had women numerous times think I was interested in them when I\'m not.  I think of myself as a fairly open and direct communicator and I think there are some deeper reasons for this disconnect.  Another thing, women frequently tell me that they initially thought I was gay because of my mannerisms and ways of interacting with women.\n* Being perceived as a predator or threat, and having women perceive or respond to my expressions of interest in them as if it were an imposition on them.  This is especially a huge insecurity for me because I tend to be attracted mostly to women who are significantly younger than me (i\'m 35 and my last long-term relationship was with someone 8 years younger, which is an age difference I felt very comfy with, but it makes me cautious with new people because of the tendency to perceive older men as predators).  I also find this really frustrating because for me, I experience attraction primarily as like, a sense of appreciation and admiration of a person, like I find the person\'s presence comforting and I want to be around them more, enjoy being around them more, and I find myself caring about them more, and I care hugely about respecting boundaries.  I\'ve found though that women\'s expressions of boundaries can involve poor, ambiguous, or absent communication.  I also used to struggle a lot with social awkwardness (especially when I was younger I would sometimes come across as someone on the autism spectrum, although I always test as not being on that spectrum) and used to have a lot of trouble reading people (and still have a lot of trouble when I\'m nervous and/or depressed), which may factor into this too.  I\'ve had numerous experiences where women have criticized me or reacted in ways that seemed extreme, in response to me expressing interest in them in ways that I all of my female friends have agreed to be perfectly respectful.  I think most straight guys seem to shrug off these experiences easily, but I feel very sensitive and I\'ve unfortunately let them get to me and contribute to me feeling super ashamed of my sexuality.  I\'m not always sure how to respond to or process situations when this happens.\n* Sometimes I wonder if there is a disconnect between how I respond to women\'s appearance and how they want men to.  For example, I find high heels and bold makeup to be a strong turnoff, but the cultural consensus seems to be that this is associated with women having sex appeal.  I feel really attracted to women who aren\'t visibly wearing makeup and who are dressed in very comfortable clothing.  Like when I think of the times I\'ve found women most attractive, they\'ve often been wearing pajamas, gym clothing, or very simple casual clothing.  It\'s really common that when I\'ve given women compliments on their appearance they\'ve responded by surprise telling me that I complimented them when they felt like they were looking at their worst / frumpiest.  I notice that when a lot of women put more care into their appearance I start feeling less comfortable around them and less attracted to them and I think this may relate to my desire for symmetry--I don\'t want to have a partner that puts a lot more effort into their appearance than I do, because I want us to have symmetry in how we think / feel about each other\'s appearance and bodies, if that makes sense?  I feel like this seems to cut me off from a lot of women though...I don\'t know.  And often when I\'ve opened up about these things when dating people it\'s come across poorly, like I\'m trying to police or control the other person\'s appearance, which is not what I want...but at the same time it is a constraint that strongly influences my attraction to another person, and it relates to the dynamic in a relationship that I want to have, and I\'m not sure how to navigate it.\n\nSo I think all of these things contribute to me spending most of my time sort of floundering around when it comes to sex and romance.\n\nI have like, a very rich social life.  I am very outgoing and make friends very easily, I have numerous close relationships.  I have several friends that I feel strongly attracted to and many more friends that I feel moderately attracted to.\n\nBut I feel really uncomfortable navigating the romantic or sexual aspects of a relationship, especially in the early stages.  (Once I\'m dating someone a lot of these issues fade away.)  I feel like all the burden is usually placed on me to push relationships in this direction, but I don\'t know how to do that gracefully and in a way that feels comfortable and right to me.  I find that I sink into feeling very insecure very easily...I find that my intuition is often way off...I\'m sort of starting to get a sense for why this might be.  But I also don\'t really know how to proceed.\n\nI\'d be really grateful for any insights or ideas or suggestions that anyone has!

I'm AFAB and my discomfort with that manifested itself in a lot of harmful ways- internalized misogyny, profound awkwardness and low self esteem, self destructive behavior, all of that. I was not an introspective person until my early 20's, at which point I began to practice cognitive behavioral therapy, and I found a medication that helps me with my anxiety. I also cut a lot of toxic people from my life and began to work towards improving myself as a person and learning to be happy.

I'm far from perfect these days, but I've come a long way. A lot of my well-being now was fought for through some of the worst circumstances one could imagine- I hit bottom a lot. But through it all, I unlearned a lot of awful cognitive distortions and really harmful ideas about a lot of things that were causing me so much anguish. I learned to speak my mind, and to listen to others. I even began to embrace the female body I live in, while also embracing my long-closeted desire to be androgynous, queer, and to love people outside of the binary. 

However, there's something that's been nagging me a lot, and it's raised a lot of questions. Throughout my life, I've felt that my body was wrong. That on the inside, I feel very male. A gentle, androgynous, non-binary male, but a male nontheless. I've learned to not hate the body I live in, with its curves and softness, and appreciate it for what I like about it. I don't hate it anymore. But it still feels so wrong. 

I used to think my dysphoria was how I expressed my low self-esteem: a safe fantasy, perhaps. But now, even as I can objectively appreciate myself, it just feels so at odds with how I see myself. I don't cringe or shy away from my reflection anymore. I don't struggle with social anxiety like I used to, I speak my thoughts and I don't try to be anyone I'm not. But I still look at myself and on a visceral level, I don't really see myself. 

In big and small ways, I've begun to explore what I call ""my boy self"". Since earlier forays into masculinity ended up being uncomfortable due to me mostly trying to be a stereotype of maleness, this time I've refused to let myself fall into traps of what I should and shouldn't do- if I'm already a genderqueer female, why would my male self be any different? I finally was able to purchase a binder and it's been *incredible*. My haircuts and outfits are decidedly non-gendered, and the only way I act these days is how I feel. But the more I play with this, the stronger my dysphoria has become. I find myself admiring how I look (hooray!) but also wishing that my jaw was more pronounced, that I was more angular, my voice was deeper, that under the same clothes I could be a male.

I have a gender neutral name from birth (thanks, parents!) and some of my friends have already begun to use gender neutral pronouns. Amusingly enough, I didn't ask any of them to do this- they just said as I began to present more androgynously, it seemed much more natural for them.

I don't really know where I'm going with this- this is just my thoughts and my experience, and I'm wondering if there are other GQ people who have similar stories. I'm not in any rush exactly, I'm still exploring myself, but the further I go, the more I feel like HRT might be in my future.

I think I\'m probably bi-sexual in that while every sexual encounter I\'ve ever had except one was with a male, I get more aroused by looking at women, and even then, if I never had sex again I don\'t think it would bother me all that much.  Until recently, not really identifying as anything in particular didn\'t bother me all that much either and it\'s not something I plan to make a big song and dance about.  I tried talkign to my husband about it and he just sort of wafted it away and said he didn\'t know what I was talking about.  Other people must feel this way, right?  I\'m not mad?

-------


Edit: here's my time line so far.


Bed and Breakfast:
Dr. Brassard has you arrive around two days before your surgery at the Gite du Marigot bed and breakfast. I guess this is a buffer period to make scheduling easier while dealing with flight delays. Since I drove in though and was close enough I kind of wished I would have had the option to just drive in the day of surgery since I just stewed in my anxiety the whole time. But to its credit the Gite was super comfy and the food was really delicious. (I'm a culinary arts major so if I say food is good, it's *good*). There's lots of sitting areas and antique furniture,  balcony, and a beautiful backyard patio with a pond. Eating is communal. You all get called down to eat together at specific times. I was kind of a socially anxious wreck so I didn't say much but I made friends with one of the trans girls. She's insanely pretty and nice. I guess I'll call her D for anonymity. We sat together and talked a lot out back and have been texting back and forth since she had surgery the day I leave the hospital.


DAY -2: Did nothing but stewed in my own anxiety all day... stomach and head were both giving me a lot of trouble.


DAY -1: all you have to do this day is take two fleet enemas, shower and shave your surgical site.  The enemas were nowhere near as bad as I expected them to be, they're super lubed so they slide in like nothing and the pressure to... evacuate is very clear without being so urgent that you're worried about cropping yourself. Slept a bit better tonight since they relieved my stomach aches and since I didn't sleep at all the first night.


SURGERY DAY:
First I want to say that this was at the Duval, not the normal surgery centre. Apparently a month ago an ex patient came in with an axe and set fire to the facility beside the recovery Centre. Everyone has been surprisingly nice about it saying they hope she gets the help she needs and stuff like that, but jeezes. I'm going to go the politcally incorrect route and say she sounds like a damn psycho. Sick or not there are always immobile trans patients there, possibly out or in surgery. Whatever her issues were there was no reason to risk killing a bunch of people, your people... Euch,  anyways, some of the nurses at the Duval aren't that knowledgeable about trans folks. So my experience may be different from what's typical. They were all super polite and kind, just a little out of their element dealing with the aftercare of a surgery they didn't know?


Day 1 of surgery - a cab picked me up outside the Gite.  The cabbie didn't speak English,  only French.  I can speak a little French but thankfully he was already informed where to go. Checking in and waiting in bed for the surgery is really scary, all you can do is look at the clock and panic. One nurse asked me if I'd donate my testicles and 8 vials of blood toward finding a cure for HIV. You get compensated $20 per testicle. I opted for that, then got changed into my hospital gown. I think I was shivering the rest of my stay in that, the hospital is as cold as $20 balls.


Dr. Brassard met me before the surgery. He was surprisingly very funny, that helped ease the tension. And he's super handsome.  I'm mostly into girls, but he's soap-opera-doctor dreamy. Anyhow,  you get wheeled outside the surgery room into a foyer where you'll meet the anesthesiologist.  He asks you a few questions then will wheel you into the surgery room.  There's a lot of terrifying machines and stuff all around but they'll immediately put you under. I was thankful of that because between the terror and cold I was shaking like crazy. I didn't wake up until it was over. They ask you a few questions and check how much you can feel. You should be 100% numb from the waist down. You'll have so much bandages and dressing on that you won't even be able to see your vagina yet and not for awhile. They give you a couple ice packs to keep on your pelvis to reduce swelling. And you have a catheter in... oh the catheter......


The next few hours in your room the nurses check on you every little bit to see how much feeling and sensation of temperature you've regained, how far down your legs you can feel and move again. Once you can feel in your toes the pain is about to begin and they'll give you a pain killer. My first catheter was changed and seemed to have only blood in it. I felt a burning pain down there which I thought was from the surgery so I asked for pain meds and tried to sleep. I woke up around 8pm and the pain was still there, much worse. I felt like I needed to pee so badly and didn't know what to do. The nurse said not to force it and gave me another pain killer. It didn't do anything, the feeling to pee kept getting stronger and stronger  It felt like I was about to literally rip apart on the inside. It was by far the most painful thing I ever felt, and reduced me to tears. They finally noticed around 10 that my catheter had no urine in it, just bloody discharge. They didn't know what to do and readjusting the catheter didn't work. They had to call Dr Brassard and he came in to fix me. How, I don't know, they had given me another med that almost totally knocked me out and everything's hazy from that point on. The next morning Dr. Brassard told me that my urethra swelled so much that it sealed shut before the catheters entrance.i don't know whether he fixed it surgically or some other way but it works fine after that night. It was so scary though. I cried and felt more pain than ever before that night. The nurses were so nice and stayed with me as much as they could but they hadn't ever seen that before so they didn't know what to do. It was a long wait of being in agony, from about 8 to 11:30.


Day 2 after surgery:
So much less eventful. I got graduated to solid foods today... I didn't eat much though because of my stomach hating me during stress, and they kept sending me stuff with dairy even though I'm lactose intolerant and even had a bracelet from the intake saying that? There was some (prepackaged) toast, a salty broth, and bowl of spaghetti, that'd all I remember eating. I got up and walking four times that day with the nurses' help. The third time I suddenly got really dizzy and threw up all that spaghetti... I'm not sure if that was just dizziness from blood pressure or if there was cheese in the sauce... the next meal I noticed had my room number on it and I seemed to get a dairy free meal of an egg salad wrap and a salad. It looked really nice but I didn't want to eat because I felt so queasy.


Day 3 - Today we (me and three trans women who were operated on the same day) were transfered to the recovery facility. Meanwhile D and the next batch of surgeru patients got brought to thr hospital. I was able to get out of bed alone and walk around in the morning at the hospital which felt fantastic. But then I was promptly put into a wheelchair and we had to take a wheel trans bus to the recovery Centre.  Laying down and walking are both nothing. Sitting on the other hand is pure agony. Normally the recovery Centre is right beside the hospital the surgery is done at but since we were at the Duval we had quite a drive. Every bump in the road and the bridges hurt like crazy. Once we were there we were shown around and given our rooms. I got a single room that was very nice. There's about 11 patients here right now. All trans women I believe, except for me and one trans guy (because he needs to spread his legs apart while sitting he gets a lazy boy recliner at dinner. Everyone said that is the 'throne' and that he is the 'king'!)


The recovery Centre has lots of sitting places,  a patio and park across the street which leads straight to the water. It's beautiful. Wifi is spotty... Eating is communal again and this time it's more of a buffet  (build your own plate) style meal. There's been chicken , pork chops,  rice,  soup, roasted potatoes,  broccoli, and salad so far. It was really yummy. There's even an all-hours coffee, toast, cereal, cookie, and Nutella(!) station if you get hungry at off hours. They even got me a carton of lactose free milk :') so I finally got some calcium and my shaking and anxiety calmed a little. I walked around outside for a few hours, mostly practicing walking up stairs. Still need to walk like a cowboy to prevent pain but it was alright! I may have pushed myself a bit too far though, when my dressing was changed, I had a bit of leakage out the side of the catheter and had to start using a massive pad that covers most of my pelvis and rectum. It's not comfortable at all... the nurse said it it gets worse I need to use a diaper. Because this hasn't been humiliating enough already. ._.


At dinner the nurse offered me pain meds and I said I wasn't in pain and didn't need them. That was a mistake.... I retired to my room and went to sleep.


Day 4 - woke up at 2 am in a lot of discomfort. Where my legs joined my pelvis were both hurting and no position felt comfortable. I figured i could last until morning and didnt want to call the nurse. I thought I'd tough it out and try to sleep more but couldn't for about 90 minutes.  Then I briefly slept and awoke to several nightmares in a row. The pain was getting worse.. and suddenly around 5 I needed to have my first bowel movement. That went okay  (we were given stool softeners and prune juice to facilitate it, and apparently mine is pretty early since it usually happens day 5 for most.) But the trouble was sitting down to do it. Sitting down on a low toilet while I was already in pain made me feel like I was going to rip apart. I was sure I ripped open my stitches or something from how much it hurt. I managed to get it done though then immediately went back to my room and called the nurse because of the pain. She came in and gave me two oxys. Waiting for them to kick in now while typing this. Phew. Going to try to sleep again now...

Tl;Dr take the damn pain killers even if you feel okay while recovering, you don't know where you'll be in a couple hours.

----------

Update 2: rest of that day was mostly uneventful and relatively positive and easy, ate, rested,  went for a couple walks.

DAY 5 - Hoo boy, another day with a complication... today was the day our batch of patients got their surgery dressing removed and the next batch of patients arrived at the recovery Centre. I remember waking up and the dressing felt almost like steel wool shoved down your underwear. It was soon dry and stiff and scratchy compared to previous days.   The others in my batch had their dressing removals go fine... but when they removed mine, I started gushing blood like crazy. They had to hold the Stent in my really hard and hold me shut in an attempt to let it clot. It hurt a little but not terribly, it was more scary than anything. I turned three blue bed lining pads pure red and near the end they kept taking my blood pressure and pulse every few minutes. So scary.
After 1 and half hours of holding me shut with periodic checking to see if the bleeding was stopping and realizing it wasn't they had to call Dr Brassard again.... It would have been easier if the hospital next to the asclepade was still open but since Brassard was at the Duval he had to drive there. He had to restitch me back up and this time I was awake for all of it. It again wasn't really painful at all thankfully, just really really scary. Feeling so self conscious and terrified over all these complications I'm having. I was suppose to get my first shower and learn sitz baths today but that got pushed back so the stitches can heal. I couldn't stop shaking or feeling like my head was going to explode from the nerves and stress of it all... walking was back to being hard again when I just had gotten use to it. I don't know how the next day will go... I'm suppose to get the Stent removed, learn and start dilating and douching.i guess I'll need to learn sitz baths and have my first shower too... I kind of hope they push something back because that's so much to learn and do all in one day... My friend got in on today's batch of patients. She said she threw up six times a day at the Duval!  I had heard another girl throwing up all night long too. I didn't have much nausea at all thankfully but I guess it affects everyone differently. 

DAY 6 - typing this update this morning so nothing to say yet. Another girl still throwing up lots. It feels super swollen around my Stent.. it's really noticeably jabbing into me now so maybe they will remove it today after all.  Scared of more complications... the dilators also look a little scary. We're supposed to dilate 4x, douche 2x, sitz baths 2x, and shower 1x a day right now. Dilations are really 25 minutes each and use three different dilators labeled 2, 3, and 4. I don't know what happened to #1. :p 2 looks reasonable.  3 is ""whew lad"". 4 is a ""oh my god how much did you pay for that cucumber I'm not a female horse!!!"" sized.... thankfully we don't need to use that scary one until month 2....",genderqueer,surgery tomorrow (brassard).

2016-05-31 10:50:26,4lumuw,6,17,"Hi all!


I’ve been struggling a bit lately to reconcile my gender identity with how I am in bed with apartner. I am currently seeing a lovely girl (cis) who has been super supportive of me and my
identity/expression. I’m genderqueer with a feminine leaning I’d say. I’m also AFAB. She’sasked me what gendered words I like in bed and always checks in with me during things and isjust super kind and lovely. We’re both kinky, so I feel the conversation of gender has come up quicker.


It’s also made me realize the extent the gender is pervasive when it comes to having sex,
obviously when it comes to vanilla sex, but especially when it comes to kink. That’s not to say
that kink is emphasizing or enforcing these norms, I just think that in vanilla sex they can bemore downplayed and subversive. I personally don’t think that gender should be necessary, butit doesn’t take long to realize that gender is actually a major thread or basis in many kinks, even
some of my own.

Anyway, I’d say with my partner we split about 60/40 when it comes to dominance or leading inbed. We’re both Capricorns and she likes to talk about how I’m the only person that has ever
out­-Capricorned her, which I find super cute because she gets really flustered and keeps telling
me that one day she’ll get the true upper hand on me, but hasn’t yet and it definitely does some
injury to her Capricorn pride, in a not actually serious way though. She does really enjoy mebeing in charge.

I don’t necessarily see myself consistently as the dominant partner. Really I just like giving andpleasing her and sometimes demand or insist (with her permission and consent of course) thatshe get that however she needs it. And I love doing it!

The one hang up I’ve been having recently, especially considering that I only came out as
genderqueer in the past few months, is that when I’m in a dominant role, I often get this feelingthat I am performing a man’s role. Now I do have a pretty androgynous presentation, but I haveabsolutely NO affinity for nor want to be a man. So this becomes a problem for me because Ifeel like heteronormativity just won't get it’s busted ass out of my sex life, where it very muchdoes not belong. It’s just frustrating to realize how deeply rooted these ideas can be within us,even when we don’t fit the model for the heterosexual patriarchy.

I let him know that he doesn\'t need to change names or pronouns or anything since it doesn\'t cause me a huge amount of distress. It\'s more of an FYI of ""hey, I\'m not cis. May start some transition-y stuff soon. Don\'t let that change what you know about me beyond that."" If he has questions, I\'ll do my best to explain them simply. \n\nMy biggest issue is deciding *when* to do it. Before we go to a party with some mutual friends? Before going to bed? After he\'s home from work? Before he goes to work? On the weekend? Just before I leave to go somewhere? Just before he leaves to do something? I imagine the news is going to impact him a lot, so I\'m mostly looking for a way to minimize the impact and the possible pain that may come with it. \n\nAny advice or experiences would be appreciated.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Considering timing when coming out to my brother (x-post /r/MtF)', 'created': 1464728427.0}"
