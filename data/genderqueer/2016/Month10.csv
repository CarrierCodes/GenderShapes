I am in no way male-identified, not on T with no plans to ever start, and my insurance is covering 80% of the $34,000 surgery (I won't be paying the entire $6,800 as I will have met my deductible by then). For those curious, my surgeon is Dr. Hansen at OHSU in Portland, and I am having double incision with nipple grafts. From start to (near) finish, all the care I have received from OHSU has been top-notch. 

I'm most worried about how uncomfortable I'll be the first week -- anesthesia makes me throw up, opioids make me dizzy. Also, stinky until drains come out after that week. I've heard a bit of witch hazel on a cotton ball is preferable to baby wipes, which contain oil, to wipe underarms and face for a bit of refreshment. Laxatives to counteract the constipating effect of the pain meds, a U-shaped neck pillow to make back-sleeping more tolerable, plenty of reading material and movies, and two solid weeks of no commitments are all things I've acquired. 

As I'm working with a combination of uncommon circumstances, I'm more than happy to answer questions about any part of the process of getting top surgery covered by insurance as a gender-neutral person not on testosterone. Also, if you've been through the healing process and have some often overlooked necessities you feel are worth a mention, post 'em below.

I'm AMAB and am coming to terms that I am not 100% cis male. I also don't think I'm 100% trans female either - for now at least, I've been identifying as NB/genderqueer. I do know, however, that I identify more on the femme end of the spectrum and have been consciously working on incorporating more femmeness into my gender presentation. I'm currently in short-term counseling to talk through my gender identity and I've already spoken to a doctor and signed an informed consent form, so no gatekeeping and I'm good to go as soon as I decide.

Of course I understand that HRT is an intensely personal decision, I've done plenty of research on the effects of HRT, I know that going on HRT/not going on HRT is not a measure of how legitimately trans or NB someone is, etc. But I think it would be helpful to hear how others - who identify as NB or genderqueer, and not necessarily as trans - made the decision to start HRT (or, on the other hand, how you decided *not* to go on HRT).

2016-10-08 00:42:53,56emef,2,3,"Hi all!

It’s been a while since I last wrote here, so let me catch you up on my story – skip the next paragraph if you want to.

I have always felt I’m different than people around me, but as I grew up in a conservative environment it was kind of a no-no to even read about LGBTQ stuff. I started university in 2013, became atheist in 2014. August 2015, that’s when I found a vlog by an openly gender fluid person. That video lead to a website, a forum, a blog post and after 24 hours without so much as a bathroom break I knew I’m anything but a straight cis male. I started to explore who I am, play with cloths and makeup – first in my room, then I started to open up to close friends. Through my university I got a therapist in January 2016 and worked through issues from past and present. 

I made progress quick, in April 2016 (on my birthday) I came out publicly as gender fluid / non-binary / gender queer. I love skirts, eye makeup, cute shoes and colourful shirts. I’m happier now then I was ever before. And I think that I should move on to the next step in my journey, and seriously consider HRT.

The first problem is that while I do want to be more feminine (and tbh I would really love to have at least small breasts), I don’t identify as a (tans)woman, and I probably never will. I’m afraid that my position can be misunderstood for being ‘unsure about being a trans-woman’ rather than a non-binary individual who feels on the feminine side of the spectrum. It worries me that this could delay the process needlessly by months, years or even straight out prohibit me from getting HRT.

The other thing is that through laziness and not knowing what or how to do, I’m not currently registered with any local GP (I believe a GP local to my parents still has my details but it’s been over 3 years since I’ve lived there). As I’m still as student with not much income to speak of I would want to go through NHS and minimise costs as much as possible.

I know there are a few clinics in area taking in new patients, but naturally as they are all staffed with general practitioners only, LGBTQ, let alone NB, issues are not really advertised front right and centre. Should I just call all of them up and ask if they accept non-binary patients? How much do I reveal in that initial contact? And what to say during the first check up all new patients are supposed to go through? When do I have the gender identity and the HRT conversations?

The last 6 months of my life have been extremely stressful. My father, to whom I have been very close for the better portion of my life, was diagnosed with dementia. As a result of this year of tension between myself and my Mother boiled over and now are relationship is pretty much destroyed. She is an overbearing, controlling person (to put it mildy) and after years of her saying and doing awful things to me I cut her out of my life. Unfortunately due to her being my father's primary care giver it means I don't get to see him either.

This recent family strife coupled with a string of toxic relationships and a stressful job have lead to a period of poor mental health. Especially in the last 2 months. During this period I have found myself asking the question ""who am I"" a lot and I've been having somewhat of an identity crisis. 

Obviously when you are having feelings like this it is only natural to begin to question things like sexuality and gender. As regards my sexuality I'm nearly 100% sure I'm a straight male. In my early 20's I thought I might have been bisexual but through experimentation confirmed that I have no sexual attraction to men. Also I have never felt the desire to dress or live as a woman. This issue I'm having seems ""different"".

I am now finding it close to impossible to identify as being male. I don't know when it happened for sure but despite the fact that I am a guy with a shaved head, a beard and athletic build, I feel the label male doesn't fit me as a person. 

On the flipside of this I noticed that I am more comfortable around women in general. This could be down to the fact that I have 5 sisters and a lot of close female friends but if I had to chose between hanging out with men or women in a social situation I would always choose women. 

Notwithstanding that point, I don't want to be a woman because again I don't think being female would fit my identity either.

So can anybody help me? Is there a word for a person who was born male, finds women attractive but doesn't identify as being either male or female? 

A bit of guidance would go a long way because this is driving me crazy and not knowing is deeply upsetting.

I am still pretty much indistinguishable from a straight white dude for most intents and purposes, and it feels somehow disrespectful to, say, the gay men I knew from high school who got all sorts of homophobic bullshit flung at them, or the trans girl I know who has been driven to suicide by her dysphoria several times, for me to just suddenly be like ""Oh, hey, I'm LGBT too"" even though I'm privileged enough that it's probably not going to be that big a deal for me. (I'm a middle-class, white academic who lives in California and whose friends are all liberal-Democrat-or-better.)

Has anyone else felt like this? How do you deal with it?

2016-10-13 02:02:02,577x5g,0,2,"First off, thanks for taking the time to read this. Secondly, I don't want to offend anyone because I realize many people struggle with their gender identity and where they feel they fit in society.

I'm a 27 year old male. I truly don't know if gender exists. I do not like labels in any facet of life,

I mostly fit the ""man"" label for my entire life. While I was not overtly masculine and fairly introspective and introverted, I am good at sports and once I was over a lot of my self esteem issues, pretty good with ladies.

I've actually found myself wishing I was more masculine growing up. Especially after watching porn growing up, I wanted a larger penis and more strength. I wanted to be dominant. But I found my self being averagely strong, thin wristed, slightly passive, slightly submissive and averagely endowed.

I feel that sexually, I am not what I want to be... But, when I live my life, without thinking, without indulging bad habits, I have a high sex drive and I'm quite dominant. I've never been with a male. I've been with a handful of females.

When I accepted that I can't really get a larger penis, I can't increase my overall size that much and whatnot, I started to want to go to the other end of the spectrum. This was pretty early on, like mid-teens.

I started looking at the females in porn and imagining having a vagina and being penetrated.

I imagined being taken, used, and doing sex acts for and to men. I created craigslists ads for men, but never acted on them (which I'm glad about).


At about 14, I tried my mothers lingerie on. I did is a handful of other times. I felt so TINGLY. It was a very good feeling. Blissful. I came twice, just by having them on and had to take them off very quickly.


I tried a former partners panties on a few times too. I had similar tingly feelings. I've never owned my own, but I'm thinking about some purchases.

I do see a connection between my porn viewing and these thoughts/feelings though. I'm vowing right now to stop the porn. I've stopped in the past, and naturally became a little more masculine and attracted more ladies.

But, I've been drawn back in the past. I know it's easy to stop and I'm now vowing to do so.

But, I'd be lying if the idea of having some clothes and makeup didn't sound e ticking and fun. And I feel like maybe I was drawn to the porn for a reason. I watch a specific kind, at times, and that is ""sissy hypno."" But I much prefer it to not use the words sissy or any homosexual slurs. I'd rather it be centered around my inner woman and inner ""slut.""

Lately I've been visualizing some some unisex clothing, maybe slightly leaning toward girly, and some makeup. I've been wanting to go out, maybe to a club, with a girl or an open minded guy.


Even if the feelings remain, I don't think the porn is a healthy way to explore them. I also worry that these feelings are spawned from a low self esteem and lack of confidence in my penis size (about 6.25 and sort of thin).

Does anyone else have similar experiences? Do you think I should wait a few weeks without porn to buy some clothes? Is there a cheap and discreet way to get clothes and makeup online? Does eyeliner, blush, mascara, and lipstick come off easily and quickly?

I will gladly accept any and all advice.

SO, here are the questions, feel free to answer only the ones you want/ are comfortable answering:

1. How do you self-identify your gender, and what does that definition mean to you?

2. What pronouns do you use?

3. Describe the style of clothing that you most often wear.

4. Talk about your choices with body hair. How do you style your hair? Do you have facial hair? What do 
you choose to shave, or choose not to shave?

5. Talk about cosmetics. Do you choose to wear makeup? Do you paint your nails? What types of soaps and perfumes do you use, if any?

6. Have you experienced being misgendered? If so, how often?

7. Do you experience dysphoria? How does that affect you?

8. Talk about children. Are you interested in having children? Would you want to carry a child if that were an option for you? Do you want to be the primary caretaker for any children you may have?

9. Talk about money. Is it important to you to provide for a family financially if you choose to have one? Is it important to you that you earn more than any partner you may have? Do you prefer to pay for things like dates? Are you uncomfortable when others pay for you or offer to pay for you?

I'm a girl, but I've always worn more masculine clothes and I've started being really nervous about letting my chest be noticeable, even though I used to be really showy about it when I had crushes on people.

I'm AFAB nonbinary and I have top surgery coming up in less than three months (omgomogmogmomgomg). I'm not on T. 

Here's what I (will) look like: 
AFAB hips, hairy pits, longish hair, top surgery scars, swim shorts (not trunks)

Does anyone have experience going out in public (YMCA) swimming like that? I don't want to get kicked out for being a topless woman, but I also feel uncomfortable and stupid wearing a women's swim suit for no reason.

I'm in Austin, TX, fwiw.

2016-10-18 16:48:47,584umb,9,13,"I was born female and I'm happy in my body. It is what it is. When I was a kid, I always wanted to be a boy. I dressed like a boy, I played with boys, I hated that I couldn't be a boy scout and I thought girls had cooties. I stopped letting people put me into dresses when I was five. It happened on a couple of occasions after that but it was incredibly rare for many years until I started doing it voluntarily (still incredibly rare). I was a hot wheels, legos, scabby knee kid.

Starting around 6/7 I played lots of ""I'll show you mine if you show me yours"" games. I wanted a penis so bad. I loved watching boys pee and I would try to pee standing up. Some boys would let me touch them. I loved exploring. They loved exploring my body too, of course. With one boy (8?) we would have what we called ""kid sex"" where basically we just got naked and grinded under the covers since we didn't know what we were doing. He was erect for sure though. It was glorious. 

My dad remarried and I got a little step-brother. We loved and hated eachother. Before he moved in with us I remember visiting him at his house (also around 8) and we were playing in his room. I don't remember how it happened but he ended up standing naked in the closet while I dusted him with a feather duster. I was ""cleaning"" him.

As we got older we did more. I was always the initiator but I didn't understand the depth of the wrongness (just that it was bad because grownups said so). I fooled around with lots of boys. Not really with them, persay... I just wanted to touch their penises. To make them hard and make them feel good. Even when I was little boys seemed to like it and I LOVED it. I was so jealous but so happy to touch it.

Various women in my life would try to put me in touch with my feminine side. They would buy me clothes and they always went unworn after a while. I felt bad but it just wasn't me. They told me I would get boobs. I hated them. In sixth grade I cut all my hair off. I played hockey in middle school and high school. I had mohawks and wore long dickies shorts and band shirts. 

I'd learned to masturbate earlier by rubbing on things but when I learned that I could do it with my hands I started looking at porn. I guess it was right around the same time that I got a good computer in my bedroom again. I like artistic drawings of the male form. Erect or flaccid it didn't matter.

I started reading erotica but preferred ""solotouch.com"" and reading stories about boys (the closer to my age, the better) pleasuring themselves or each other. Often they were recollections written by older men. Every once in a while I would read stories written by women but they didn't do it for me. I would learn something maybe about how to touch myself better but then go back to reading m-m stories. 

I'm 25. I dress modestly most of the time but I have a nice feminine form. I wear clothes that are designed for women's shapes but are ideally men's styles. Long shorts, cargo pockets, plaid button up shirts, etc. I don't wear makeup and for the past ten years my hair was long and straight and simple brown. I'll sometimes wear a dress for special occasions and I floor people. 

I kissed a girl once in high school and was revolted. She was bi and it was a dare and I gave it my best shot but it wasn't for me. I've had several LTRs and a couple dozen hookups or short relationships. I love guys. I'm more comfortable with my body now (I've always been fairly neutral and passive) and I hope to be a mother someday. 

I also really imagine myself having a penis like... all the time. I watch porn of guys pleasuring themselves. I watch gay blowjob porn. I don't watch porn with girls in it. My favorite is POV fleshlight fucking. I don't like seeing women get fucked and I don't really like watching guys get fucked either. 

I don't feel intensely enough to want to change my gender (like I said, I'd like to be a mother someday!) but I did when I was a kid. The men in my life have greatly benefited from my abnormally high fascination with the male anatomy and it makes me happy to be able to provide such pleasure. 

I've never really identified as a woman though, even though I've tried. This summer I went through a really terrible breakup among other things and chopped all my hair off. I spike it in the front like a 7th grade boy and I love it. Everyone else loves it too and I feel so good to be me!

I just want I guess a better understanding of what kind of identity me really is? I have some psychological problems and I'm trying to label those as well, but I feel like labeling my gender identity is also important.

I was a hot wheels, legos, scabby knee kid.\n\nStarting around 6/7 I played lots of ""I\'ll show you mine if you show me yours"" games. I wanted a penis so bad. I loved watching boys pee and I would try to pee standing up. Some boys would let me touch them. I loved exploring. They loved exploring my body too, of course. With one boy (8?) we would have what we called ""kid sex"" where basically we just got naked and grinded under the covers since we didn\'t know what we were doing. He was erect for sure though. It was glorious. \n\nMy dad remarried and I got a little step-brother. We loved and hated eachother. Before he moved in with us I remember visiting him at his house (also around 8) and we were playing in his room. I don\'t remember how it happened but he ended up standing naked in the closet while I dusted him with a feather duster. I was ""cleaning"" him.\n\nAs we got older we did more. I was always the initiator but I didn\'t understand the depth of the wrongness (just that it was bad because grownups said so). I fooled around with lots of boys. Not really with them, persay... I just wanted to touch their penises. To make them hard and make them feel good. Even when I was little boys seemed to like it and I LOVED it. I was so jealous but so happy to touch it.\n\nVarious women in my life would try to put me in touch with my feminine side. They would buy me clothes and they always went unworn after a while. I felt bad but it just wasn\'t me. They told me I would get boobs. I hated them. In sixth grade I cut all my hair off. I played hockey in middle school and high school. I had mohawks and wore long dickies shorts and band shirts. \n\nI\'d learned to masturbate earlier by rubbing on things but when I learned that I could do it with my hands I started looking at porn. I guess it was right around the same time that I got a good computer in my bedroom again. I like artistic drawings of the male form. Erect or flaccid it didn\'t matter.\n\nI started reading erotica but preferred ""solotouch.com"" and reading stories about boys (the closer to my age, the better) pleasuring themselves or each other. Often they were recollections written by older men. Every once in a while I would read stories written by women but they didn\'t do it for me. I would learn something maybe about how to touch myself better but then go back to reading m-m stories. \n\nI\'m 25. I dress modestly most of the time but I have a nice feminine form. I wear clothes that are designed for women\'s shapes but are ideally men\'s styles. Long shorts, cargo pockets, plaid button up shirts, etc. I don\'t wear makeup and for the past ten years my hair was long and straight and simple brown. I\'ll sometimes wear a dress for special occasions and I floor people. \n\nI kissed a girl once in high school and was revolted. She was bi and it was a dare and I gave it my best shot but it wasn\'t for me. I\'ve had several LTRs and a couple dozen hookups or short relationships. I love guys. I\'m more comfortable with my body now (I\'ve always been fairly neutral and passive) and I hope to be a mother someday. \n\nI also really imagine myself having a penis like... all the time. I watch porn of guys pleasuring themselves. I watch gay blowjob porn. I don\'t watch porn with girls in it. My favorite is POV fleshlight fucking. I don\'t like seeing women get fucked and I don\'t really like watching guys get fucked either. \n\nI don\'t feel intensely enough to want to change my gender (like I said, I\'d like to be a mother someday!) but I did when I was a kid. The men in my life have greatly benefited from my abnormally high fascination with the male anatomy and it makes me happy to be able to provide such pleasure. \n\nI\'ve never really identified as a woman though, even though I\'ve tried. This summer I went through a really terrible breakup among other things and chopped all my hair off. I spike it in the front like a 7th grade boy and I love it. Everyone else loves it too and I feel so good to be me!\n\nI just want I guess a better understanding of what kind of identity me really is? I have some psychological problems and I\'m trying to label those as well, but I feel like labeling my gender identity is also important.\n\nMy best guess right now is that I\'m androsexual?

2016-10-19 02:56:40,5883uw,8,4,"Hi everybody! So I'm going to try and not make this too long, but whatever.

Anyways, I'm afab but I sort of don't feel like a girl. I like to hang out with guys, wear masculine clothing, and play sports with boys. Most of the people at my school don't really see me as a girl, so I feel uncomfortable going to the girl locker room. I haven't gone in there for two years. Also whenever I wear typically feminine clothing, like the one time I wore a dress for an orchestra concert, people laughed at me and said things that sort of hurt my feelings. 

The thing is, for a while I identified as a demigirl. This was because I felt sort of like a girl and then sort of not like a girl. But for a few months now this has been bothering me. I don't really want a girl body but I don't want to be a boy. I want to be mostly masculine but sort of a girl? I don't really know how to describe it. I don't want to really have a chest or curves or things like that, but I don't want male genitals. This is confusing.

So recently I've thought about identifying as a demiboy, because I feel sort of 75% masculine and then 20~% female. Is this okay? Well, is this heading in the right direction? I also don't want to label myself this to be a special snowflake, it's just that I'm somewhere in the middle of being a girl and being a boy, but leaning towards boy? I'm confused.

Also the demigender subreddits aren't really populated. I literally found like 3 active people on them. So I came here.

TL;DR: Pretty much I have a girl body, but on a spectrum of male-female I'm in the middle leaning towards male? So am I a demiboy? I think so? Help meh pls?

The legislation which sparked this issue in Canada is bill C-16:
&gt;The enactment also amends the Criminal Code to extend the protection against hate propaganda set out in that Act to any section of the public that is distinguished by **gender identity or expression** and to clearly set out that evidence that an offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on **gender identity or expression** constitutes an aggravating circumstance that a court must take into consideration when it imposes a sentence.

Dr. Peterson is claiming that the new provisions would make using the wrong pronoun on a person an offence which could be punishable, and would therefore constitute an enforcement of correct speech which for to him and many others seems abhorrent. The university administration who was pressuring Dr. Peterson to stop earlier has actually relented and accepted to hold a debate on the matter in order to discuss the nuances of gender determination, pronoun usage, free speech and legislation relating to it. 
I really hope that this goes over well and presents both sides of the arguments sufficiently since it's impact could be significant. As he mentioned in his [previous video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmNKPL1Y4g0&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1485) it could be setting the standard and direction for many other educational facilities in the world.

2016-10-28 19:46:19,59wiqf,18,21,"Being diagnosed with autism in my youth, I (AFAB) was put into a special ed setting which was a predominantly male environment. There were a few other girls there but they did not have similar diagnoses to mine. I didn't fit in with the autistic boys and associated masculinity with mischief. 

Growing up I knew that there were masculine women, feminine men, and I accepted the existence of both. However as I got older it became apparent that despite taking behavioral therapies, I understood neither men's or women's ingroup-outgroup behavior. 

There were tomboys, which are women who understand and fit in with male groups, and adopt male habits. However my lack of a fit with the gender binary isn't really due to this. 

As we go into our 30s I have noticed that there is more of a societal emphasis on gender and its roles. Marriage and kids become a salient concern for many people while people with mental differences are sometimes stuck in the late teens / early 20s realm of psychosocial development. 

As a child I didn't play with Barbie or GI Joe extensively. I played computer games in the DOS os. When other students read gendered young adult fiction, I gravitated toward nonfiction that didn't discuss gender. I identified my personal image with gender neutral items such as the Troll dolls. 

When other students were developing their gender identities through gendered musical genres, I listened to largely nongendered, nonsexual music until relatively recently.  

Sometime in my teens or 20s, I became invested in femininity by realizing that it meant that I would not be forced into toxic masculinity. Because I only really started actively identifying femininely so that I would not be made to mature into contact sports and violence. 

I noticed that both men and masculine women are made to ""grow up"" into such people so I started presenting more femme, for self protection. Also, neurodiverse people who appear masculine face more police violence than those who appear feminine. 

When an autistic man, especially a tall autistic man, has a meltdown it is viewed as a threat to safety due to men being perceived as having more agency. More childhood dxed AMAB autistic people take major tranquilizers or have psychiatric histories than childhood diagnosed AFABs. 

I still play with stuffed animals but this stands alone. My masculine and feminine interests both kind of cohere with each other rather than with masculinity qua masculinity, or femininity qua femininity. 

For the most part, I have defined femininity - for myself - as a rejection of what I viewed as the aspects of masculinity I don't like. 

The aspects of masculinity I don't like are martial things: combat sports, wargames, testing social limits through dominance and unpredictable behavior. I am uncomfortable with the drama and volatility of day-trading, but my portfolio contains risky, non-ordinary investments such as peer-to-peer lending. 

However, my femininity is also ambiguous: I form friendship networks in a masculine-typical manner of having multiple friends groups around various special-interest nuclei, without many close friends. I cook and clean to optimize my well-being - I enjoy children because I have child-like interests. 

Yet because femininity is the marked category, I felt more comfortable identifying as such despite not fully fitting into either group.

2016-10-28 23:14:32,59xm89,0,10,"So after three weeks of a bad depression spell that was partially caused by gender confusion, I finally had my first Skype session with a gender therapist from the Transgender Institute. It went well. She asked me about my history and all that stuff. She gave me three book recommendations and wants me to write a two-to-five page autobio about my struggles with my identity (which sounds tedious, but I love writing so it's no big deal to me).

First one is many times on asktg for instance I want to use casual familial language, but understand that not everyone identifies as a ""brother or sister"". is there a way to do this inclusively? I just tend to avoid it. 

Is your experience with dysphoria similar to the ""typical"" description?

What else can I do? I am direct and salty af when people aren't affirming of non binary identities. I'm disgusted this is a point of contention among binary trans people. I want to challenge the hypocrisy in our community in all ways possible.

2016-10-30 19:41:41,5a7u69,3,28,"I don't usually get down about gender-related stuff, because I have come to accept the way things are for the most part.

But today I'm visiting my family and it just feels like they don't make enough effort. They do make an effort and I ""appreciate"" that in as far as you can appreciate someone doing something that they should automatically be doing anyway (I know this comes off as entitled, but I just feel like if I ask politely, don't get annoyed when they slip up and patiently wait for everyone to remember, people should at least be making my feelings somewhat of a priority). 
Sometimes I feel differently. Sometimes I can deal with things and I feel a lot more sympathetic with people. I know that it's difficult for some people to remember pronouns, when obviously they've been heavily conditioned in the opposite way. If I was in their position, I would find it hard too. If I'd never heard of trans people before and I had no experience of it, maybe I'd struggle a bit too. But today I feel really sad and I just want people to stop calling me she. It hurts.
Today I feel like my asking for people not to call me she is like someone asking not to be called Joey when they prefer Joseph. If people just KEEP calling them Joey, is that just okay? Is that ""oh sorry, I forget easily"" or is it ""come on now, can you please just respect what I've asked? I'm not asking for much"" I can't tell! I can't make up my mind whether to be sympathetic or pissed off lol.

I've been on T for almost 8 months and I can now pass as male. Strangers don't question me anymore and in the town where I live (away from my family), I live a comfortable and confident life. My ID says male, my name is legally changed, the law now recognises me as male and yet my family are so casual about it. If I try to talk to them about it, all I get is ""well you can't expect us to remember ALL the time"" as if it's some chore, as if I'm expecting way too much. I get this vibe of ""We humour you enough, don't we?"" and ""well if you decide to go and be a freak, you have to expect people to not take you seriously"" lol. It's not like these things are said, but I feel them. I can't be bothered anymore, you guys. I love my family, but they're so ignorant. It makes me not want to visit them. I came out to them a year and a half ago. Before then, I was happy to be around them. I felt like I could contribute to conversations and I had good bonds with everyone. Now I just avoid talking, because I know if I talk they'll use the wrong pronouns and name and it'll just get me down. So I'd rather not talk at all. 
Plus it's so embarrassing sometimes. Today one of my family members called me she in front of a cashier and the cashier was really confused because there were no women there. I don't look or sound like a woman anymore. I was embarrassed, I hated it so much. 

Sometimes I just feel pissed off. It feels like we have to ask for permission from EVERYONE, to be ourselves. ""Oh please can I have some HRT? No problem, I'll wait 3 years. Please can I change my name? Please can you remember my pronouns? No? Okay, I'll just wait a few more years then, no problem. Am I allowed to use this toilet? No, oh okay I'm sorry. I'll just piss where you tell me to then. Oh, I can't go into either bathroom? Okie doke, I'll just piss my pants or something, I'll figure it out, I deserve it for being different"" lol. Ahhh.

2016-10-31 08:45:53,5ab7vt,17,15,"I'm genderqueer, and I've never had anything which could be termed an ""internal sense of gender"", which many people describe as being at the core of what gender identity is. I have a lot of feelings about things that are gendered (which often shift day to day), but they don't form anything coherent enough to describe as an overall internal sense of my gender. Some examples of these feelings:

* Breasts - shifts from ""meh"" to ""I love them!"" (I'm AMAB but have gynecomastia)
* Penis - shifts from ""meh"" to ""what is this thing and why the hell is it attached to my body?""  (except during sex - then it's great)
* Body hair - ""meh"" to ""I want to shave this all off""
* Deep voice - love it
* Beard - love it
* Preferred clothing - neutral to feminine

I'm not at all sure how these things fit together into an overall feeling of gender (if that fitting together is even what happens to people with such a feeling), they seem to me like fairly separate aspects of my personality and my relationship to my body.

So, my question is: can anyone describe to me what gender identity *feels* like? Is it a fitting together of different aspects into something coherent? Or a separate sensation, like feeling hot or cold? Or something else entirely? I realise that this is a really difficult, and individual, question to answer, but I'd be grateful for any analogies, descriptions etc. no matter how imperfect.

Thanks!
