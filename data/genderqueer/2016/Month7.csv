So I've always had a sense of uncomfortableness that I've recently come to associate with a sense of dysphoria.

I was born female and still present as such. I do however and have always had days where I feel extremely uncomfortable with being feminine. This happens most intensely when I dress extraordinarily feminine (ex: prom, thinking about getting married) but I love make up and having winged eyeliner and things outside of the typical every day make up.

Lately I've been having dysphoria when I look at my hair. I don't necessarily think ""I want a men's hair cut"" but I do feel the long hair is not me and I need short hair. (I'm cutting it next week) 

It doesn't necessarily go day by day immediate changes more just like inklings. 

For a while explored my sexuality thinking I may be gay or bi. Throughly exploration I've discovered I am interested in men (straight? If we're using my birth gender). 

For the most part I feel comfortable in my body when I dress somewhat neutral (women's jeans and plain women's shirt). When I wear a dress I feel really uncomfortable to the point where I feel sick and want to hide. When people complement me in this type of dress I feel almost violated. 

I'm also afraid to express these things to my SO because he's a straight male and I don't know how he would feel about it.

My presentation and identity are more genderqueer/transmasculine than FTM. I'm on a low dose of T and am planning to have top surgery, although I already have a small chest and have always looked pretty androgynous anyway. All I want out of this is a lower voice and some facial hair (I'm ok with downstairs growth as well, not something I actively desire but not something that would scare me off of being on T either). So I'm not planning to be on T indefinitely, just until I get the changes I want.

At this point in my life I've prioritized my own feelings when I look in the mirror, over the way society chooses to perceive my gender presentation. I've tried to work at feeling strong enough about my own identity, that other people's interpretations of it (i.e. being misgendered as female) are inconsequential. So I kinda told myself, I don't expect to pass all the time as male, depending on how my changes go on T...it's more important to simply feel comfortable, and that will give me the confidence to deal with how the rest of the world treats me.

And that's all fine and good in theory, but in practice it is much harder. It bothers me that it feels like society is forcing my hand to ""pick a side"" of the binary in a way that I want to remain fluid. It makes me sad and angry that no matter what the fuck I do with my presentation, I still seem to be a target for cat-calling and men calling to me at night like ""Goodnight miss"" ""have a good night ma'am."" You know, stuff like that. I hate the fact that it seems to happen more when I'm wearing nice clothes. I'm into fashion, I love my clothes, and I resent the fact that in order to stop this I would apparently have to dress much differently (i.e. less gay haha). I had a sort of dark ages phase in my mid-20's where I wasn't really affiliating with any subcultures anymore but didn't know how to dress otherwise, so my style was really bland and generic. Ironically, back then, I passed as male more often...but I just looked really boring. It's just not how I want to look.

So how then do I reconcile looking how I want, with the reality that I'm apparently not off these guys' radar yet? Has anyone had a similar experience? How long did it take until you stopped getting cat-called?

What do you make of this? Is it directed at people like us?

I, personally, do not desire surgery to undergo a sex change. And I believe that not conforming to gender roles does, in most cases, make you transgender. The only point here I disagree with is the part about dysphoria; I do have very intense dysphoria, I hate my appearance, I hate having masculine body traits, I hate my voice, etc.

It's hard because I'm not sure when being a specific gender feels like and I try to not think about it *too* much, but I keep rotating between feeling like a guy (birth sex) and feeling...well not like one. I initially thought I may be genderfluid, but I'm not sure if that's the case because I've heard GF people typically wake up as one given gender -- I feel like it changes multiple times during the day depending on my experiences.

2016-07-08 04:49:17,4rszg4,4,15,"Just needed to say that to someone.  Currently I feel like I am locked in a cage with my gender.  I am out as bi.  But over the last 1.5 months my gender identity has been properly pinned down.  My life is fantastic!  I live in a national park, this park is my favorite place in the whole world and I get to live and work here for the summer. I have good friends and I make ok money and I live carefree of shit going on in a great welcoming and fun place.  

I have a secret I haven't told anyone except an old high school friend who now identifies as trans that I am genderfluid.  And that I have pretty bad dysphoria with myself (AMAB).  I want to pass as both genders and tell people what to use based on what I feel but I haven't come out and while I eventually want to but the prospect is very scary. How do I get to where I want to? Well that's next on my bucket list to think about.

I figured out my gender was screwed up over the course of a year and a half.  I like my little pony,  this cartoon show changed my perspective on gender, it allowed me to explore my cis, straight assumptions I had.  The first thing out the window was straight.  That was pretty quick to come as I started introspecting and realizing that I had boy crushes and this one guy who sparked it all.  It wasn't until a few weeks ago that my gender identify went all fucked up.  The term male was randomly so shallow for how I felt.  I liked female pronouns at times I WANTED to be female at times.  I buried these forever and then I just couldn't hold it back anymore.  I struggled with what I was but genderfluid made so much sense.  I want to pass as male and female and say what I feel like based on what I feel like.  I thought I could hold these feelings back as I was kinda content being masculine.  

Then in creeped the dysphoria.  It's just THERE.  I don't want to change my sex I just want to change my face so bad.  I hate my facial hair.  This week and last week it crept in and I realized I can't live just male.  It's denying how I feel too much.  I just want to be able to be misgendered and then correct people.  The one time this happened it felt so right.  It happened to someone else on Tuesday and that felt so right.

And thus where I am now.  I am terrified to come out.  My family would be confused ambit accepting I think.  The only reason I make this long ass rambling post about a bunch of my feelings is because I need it out and I need an outlet.  And for now reddit is my outlet.  I get to be genuine here.  

My mental health is great outside of this.  Nothing to put pressure on me.  I am very happy with my life.  So I don't feel super bad about bottling up a bit and making sure I have an idea of what it is I want until I out myself slowly.

This is the first song they released that's not inspired by Life is Strange (which is an awesome game BTW). Koethe's not planning on revealing the official meaning of the song for a while, but it seems to have strong non-binary themes to me. (Binary code, X &amp; Y, define on the line, and the whole narrative really) What do you think?

The lyrics:
&gt;(Verse 1)  
“By default or by design?”  
Hope to,  
In a desperate bid, define  
On the line  
While stands another side  
What I thought that I could hide  
With time  

&gt;(Chorus 1)  
Don’t tell me don’t tell me  
What I am of  
You’re zeros and ones but I knew  
This is all this is all  
That I ever was  
It’s overdue  

&gt;(Verse 2)  
In a head of holes I find  
You complicate  
Consumed with the what and why  
The way you operate  
Yet In the waking mind  
It becomes a part of mine  
Somethings not right  

&gt;(Chorus 2)  
Don’t tell me don’t tell me  
What I am of  
You’re zeros you’re ones but I knew  
This is all this is all  
That I ever was  
It’s overdue  

&gt;(Verse 3)  
Like the noose around my neck  
You suffocate

I've been in the process of coming out as nonbinary since the beginning of this year, and more publicly/openly the past few months. And I've been out as bi for a couple years. In the past, I've thought that most of my crushes (generally more masculine, regardless of gender) were mostly to do with my bi orientation. 

BUT, now that I'm sorting through and figuring out my gender identity, I realize that it's less of a ""I wanna frick you"" thing, and more of a ""I wanna BE you"" thing (especially for my male-bodied crushes)! 

So now, when I obsess over celebrity crushes *cough Martin Freeman cough Josh Homme cough*, I dunno, gender things just click. And I feel more confident in my body when I wear my favorite suit or style my hair a certain way. It's like, ""I think I look hot!""

I'm a bi, cisgendered guy, but have had some trouble understanding how being genderqueer works. I hope none of what I say comes across as offensive, that is not my intention at all. I would love to learn about this community so I can become more tolerant.

My major issue with understanding this community is my belief, or understanding that gender is a binary, at least socially. Physically people may be born without a clear gender, but socially gender seems to be pretty simple. We have stereotypes and social mores regarding what it means to be male or female. 
My question is basically, does a genderqueer person feel they are biologically between genders or socially between genders?
For example, do you feel like you have a set of genitals, but feel you belong to a different body? 
Or do you feel you are forced into social mores that you want to be free from? And why does being a feminine man or a masculine woman not go far enough?

I would really appreciate any feedback, since I desperately want to be able to say I support this community, as it is so evidentially full of wonderful people.

I'm talking mostly about stuff on r/changemyview . It seems like every other day there's another post about gender identity. Here's how it goes:

1. The OP's view is respectful, but misinformed. I notice the top comments are all from cis people, and they're well-intentioned but flawed.

2. I, having no memory for pain, leave a reply to OP's comment, clarifying a few points and specifying that I know all this because, unlike a lot of the other commenters, I'm trans.

3. After a little while, I get one or two comments. Respectful ones! Oh, look, they're curious about my experience. They're so polite, I should respond!

4. Here I get one or two not-as-respectful questions on my original comment. It's not r/the_donald or anything, but they say things like ""transgenderism"" and ask things like, ""How do you know if you're actually trans and not just into manly/feminine things?""

5. I answer these questions too, because the commenter seems curious and not vicious. After all, this was a question I had when I was questioning my own identity.

6. Cue the thousand word responses heavily implying (but of COURSE not saying!) that I'm wrong, my identity is wrong, I'm just a dumb cis who likes boy things. *(Oh, yeah, and at least one of the seemingly-respectful comments from earlier ends up down this road, too.)*

7. Cue the thousand word replies from your's truly, who just *can't for the life of them stop correcting these jerks*, for no real reason.

8. Repeat steps 6-7 until I get too fed up or dysphoric to continue.

I don't get it. No matter how many times or how many ways I try to explain what it's like - to feel disconnected and lost, and then to feel whole - people seem determined not to understand. (Lol, can you tell I'm young?)

Maybe I should be more jaded. I should just accept that I can't convince everybody, and life isn't fair, and I probably shouldn't even be trying. I should just live my life for myself and not bother.

I just can't get it out of my head, though. That if I can just find the right words in the right order, I can make them understand. If not to make my life easier, than maybe somebody else's. I want so badly to reach people.

I have started to feel really uncomfortable, specifically with all the talk of bachelor and bachelorette parties.

I've been to a bunch of weddings, all earlier in life before I was ""out"" as nonbinary, but I've never been invited to a bachelor party, and I'm not sure I'd want to.  Nor would I necessarily feel comfortable going to a bachelorette party.  I have some weddings coming up and I haven't been invited to this sort of party and I'm sort of hoping I am not, but even just being around the talk of them makes me feel uncomfortable.

I really dislike gender segregation.  I tend to want things in our society to be genderless, mixed gender, or not referencing / breaking down along gender lines.  I feel discomfort when I'm in a group and the group gets divided by gender--usually I get put with the men, as I'm AMAB, and I feel really uncomfortable with that, but I also can be wary about asking to be included with the women, because I feel very cautious about intruding on a female-only space as I don't really feel female and I'm aware that I'm often perceived as male.

And like, when people go on and on talking about these parties, and how fun they are, or even just talking about them neutrally, I feel excluded and uncomfortable.

I have a small yet very feminine figure (big hips, unporportiinately large chest). I'm attractive when I dress feminine. I get alot of comments/compliments.

Though I feel awkward and uncomfortable about that. Dressing overtly feminine, I feel like I'm dressed up like something I'm not. I feel like a phony. I never feel quite like the girls and women I know. Though, I have felt quite at home and at ease with other queer identified and adrogynous people that seem to have a balance of masculine and feminine. I certainly don't see myself as a man. But when I am contrasted with men and made to feel or bring seen or treated like a woman, blah. It's caused a lot of discomfort and anxiety. Even just be called a girl is uncomfortable.

 For the past few years I have gradually shifted away from some of my femininity at least in terms of appearance. I have a mixture of mens and womens clothing. Ive cut my hair short. I've dated both men and women, although my relationships have been more significant with women. Though, generally speaking, most of the women have been quite adrogynous and our relationships were typically quite balanced with gender roles not really playing any role. This was comfortable for me. 

As of late, I've begun dating a transman post transition.  Often spendong time with his friends who are either cis men or trans men. I'm definitely seen as a girl in these situations.  I'm particularly uncomfortable when juxtaposed with the men, or even in a situation where there is another female where I feel like the men might expect me to act or be or look like them. And that's so uncomfortable. It might just be all in my head. But regardless, I feel a tug of war between genders. I don't feel like either.  

I think I have lovely feminine traits and good masculine ones too. Sometimes I don't mind looking prettier. Sometimes I intentionally dress more boyish, though, I would never ever pass as a man. I'm uncomfortable with my breasts, wearing high compression sports bras and having purchased a binder (though, it's too hot to wear it right now). I also am very uncomfortable about my hips. 

My partner is very supportive and okay with it  and attracted to me regardless. He's completely okay with me identifying as genderqueer.  Though, still, in comparison, I'm the feminine one in the relationship.

Sometimes I wonder if I'm making something out of nothing.  Or I dunno. It'd be great if anyone had any shared experiences or thoughts.

**Life before late 2013**

In retrospect, I was not normal.  I never picked up on this, despite the fact that, when I was about three, I asked my parents when I could be a girl.  Really?  *That* didn't tip me off?  I'm a bit dense sometimes.

Also, I grew long hair, just cause.

&amp;nbsp;

**Late 2013**

Some friends and I decided on the spur of the moment to braid my hair.  Then to put on makeup.  And I decided ""Let's make me some boobs.""  Then I sat there, pretending to be this ""alter ego.""  I never put on any ""girl"" clothes, save for some heels.  We came up with this elaborate (not really) plan to trick potential new students at our high school into thinking there was me and my twin sister at orientation.  ('Twas a boarding school, and I loved it, for the record.)  Never did it, but I liked the idea, and found myself thinking *How do I make this the most convincing?*

Anyways, after all that, I found myself feeling like there was something inside me, wanting to be let out.  I decided that it was just some weird psychological phenomenon related to cross-dressing and dismissed it. (Blegh.  I know.  Really?)

&amp;nbsp;

**September 2015**
One of my friends who helped with the above thing came and visited me and my other friends in college.  We decided to revisit that night.  But this time, another friend who was there, about the same size as me (I'm average AFAB size), went and got one of her dresses, and another friend made me better boobs.  It was weird, but satisfying, and prompted me to reconsider a Halloween idea me and some friends had.  We were going to be (never were) a heavy metal band (two of us have long hair, perfect for headbanging), and I decided to be female (never did) for Halloween.  I found myself delving deeply into how to be convincing, decided to take some online ""gender quizzes"" out of curiosity, found one that actually seemed pretty good at the time (mediocre now, but better than those silly 10 question ones) and it told me I was androgynous.  I decided that didn't *quite* fit me, but decided genderfluid worked better.  I discovered then that I was not cis.

A friend said to me at one point ""You know, if you decide to go all out (meaning MtF), I will support you all the way.""  Outside, I was like ""Ok.""  Inside, my brain kinda did a double take.  I hadn't really thought of that.

&amp;nbsp;

**October 2015**

Over time, my male side faded and my female side took over.  I decided I actually was MtF.  I went to a horse farm, and this woman was talking to her daughter (I had already gone out in girl-mode, I wasted no time) and told her to brush her horse ""like she is,"" referring to me.  I was happy.  But I stopped the girl mode when I got back to school, where people who were not my friends but still knew who I was might recognize me.

I told my parents.  They were fine.  My sister doesn't know.  It would be a little too weird for her.  I'm busy breaking down the idea of gender rigidity and roles for her first, to make it less of a big deal.

&amp;nbsp;

**Rest of Fall 2015**

I was getting this thing called dysphoria.  It didn't make sense to me.  Why would I have it?  I was a very calm transgender person.  It seemed more social, though, as I didn't feel like I could present like I wanted to.  I would sit in my dorm room alone and brood, at a couple points, even cry.  It didn't make sense.  Gender didn't make sense.  Nothing made sense.  I was able to get myself up and go to dinner with friends, so that really helped, as I knew it would.  But I even cried at dinner once.

&amp;nbsp;

**Christmas Break 2015-2016**

I began questioning again.  I knew that maleness was gone, but the femaleness seemed to be unfitting, too, after some time.  My friends were super supportive, so I thought that maybe they were too supportive, and accidentally didn't let me think for myself once I got the ball rolling.  Once I could, I decided I was agender.

&amp;nbsp;

**January 2016**

I got diagnosed with T1 Diabetes.  I realized that, as long as I had had the symptoms, it was likely that a small amount of dysphoria was exaggerated into what I got the previous fall.  So yeah.

&amp;nbsp;

**The Rest of Spring 2016**

I joined my college's social club for lgbt people.  It was a great decision.  That first night, we went to dinner together.  While leaving, I looked at my reflection in the door and was confused by it.  Was that really me?  It didn't look bad, but it didn't look right, either.  Made a mental note of that real fast.

Had a couple times when feminine feelings emerged for a short time.  They left fairly quickly.

&amp;nbsp;

**Summer 2016** *(including now)*

Really started managing my diabetes well.  Got a pump and sensor, so I'm pretty much set.  Also got a job in retail.  I get an even mixture, it seems, of ""Ma'am"" and ""Sir,"" and the kids are comical sometimes with their perception of me.  Funny thing is, I don't present at all.  I just dress malely, but I still have my long hair.  Maybe there's something I do subconsiously?  I have no idea.  But I think this started something.  I looked at my legs one day, saw the hair, and did not like it.  From there, thoughts of being more feminine slowly returned.  I wanted to dream it again like I did before.  I realized that it might not be harmful to ace-bandage my lower abdomen for the curves as long as I'm careful (with a pump, a corset is a big no, and I don't really like them anyway).  Kinda increased more and more.  Then, a couple of nights ago, I got irritable.  Out of nowhere, it seemed.  I thought it was just cause I was hungry (I was).  Next day, it was a **FLOOD** of femininity and dysphoria.  I didn't want to leave my room at risk of my family noticing something was wrong (I hate that for some silly reason, I think I'm too prideful).  Honestly, I didn't really want to do anything.  That was scary.  It is scary.  It sounds like depression.  I've been depressed before, everyone has, but that was intense and out of nowhere.  I never really fully recovered, either, which is the scariest part.  *It's persistant.*  I can cover it up, but my interactions don't feel sincere now.  Only when I'm fully immersed in something does it go away.  Then it comes back afterward.  This is new.  And I now know that it's *not* the diabetes.  And I have a couple of really good friends who have no idea, but I want so badly to tell them, but I'm scared.

I'm confused.

Alas, there was no problem at all. A friend in her suit even carried me around like a princess haha.

Yesterday, I was feeling a bit dysphoric and decided to wear a simple skirt while working on homework. I later had a few drinks. Then, I felt the urge to change into another outfit, put on my favorite wig, and go out for a walk around my apartment complex. It was certainly not the safest time to go out for a walk (about 3-4 in the morning when I left). I fortunately decided to at least sober up before departing. Then, I grabbed a satchel-thingamajig to hold my stuff. My hands were a bit shaky as I grabbed a cigarette and stepped outside in little more than a skirt, tank top (over some padding), and sneakers.

It was pretty nerve-racking at first. Now that I think about it, my walking pace was definitely quicker than normal. Along the way, I heard some people talking next to an outdoor grill. I also walked right past the front of a running car before realizing it. A couple even walked past me in a somewhat dim area. Nobody said anything to me, which was a huge relief. Eventually, my walking pace slowed down. I was still nervous, but tried to focus on using more... feminine body language to increase my chances of passing at night (6'1"", maybe 150lbs). Still not tired, I decided to drive to my nearby campus and walk around.

On the way there, a police car came up behind me pretty quickly. I was mostly scared of them seeing what I was wearing as a result of being pulled over. Fortunately, I switched lanes and they sped past me.

Only animals and traffic of nearby roads could be heard from campus. As I walked past the library, I stared at my reflection in the window. It was scary to be crossdressing in public, at night, and alone. But damn, it was exhilarating and gave me a sense of pride. 

I've been called vulgar names for no apparent reason by random people driving by. The amount of people that have been jumped or harassed for being ""different"" is certainly a concern. However, last night was quite a confidence boost. It's tempting to go out again earlier tonight, even if that means that more people would be around.

If you'd ever like to try something similar, I'd highly recommend going with friends. I think that having them along for protection, conversation, and general support could make it easier to expand your comfort zone.

Eventually, my walking pace slowed down. I was still nervous, but tried to focus on using more... feminine body language to increase my chances of passing at night (6\'1"", maybe 150lbs). Still not tired, I decided to drive to my nearby campus and walk around.\n\nOn the way there, a police car came up behind me pretty quickly. I was mostly scared of them seeing what I was wearing as a result of being pulled over. Fortunately, I switched lanes and they sped past me.\n\nOnly animals and traffic of nearby roads could be heard from campus. As I walked past the library, I stared at my reflection in the window. It was scary to be crossdressing in public, at night, and alone. But damn, it was exhilarating and gave me a sense of pride. \n\nI\'ve been called vulgar names for no apparent reason by random people driving by. The amount of people that have been jumped or harassed for being ""different"" is certainly a concern. However, last night was quite a confidence boost. It\'s tempting to go out again earlier tonight, even if that means that more people would be around.\n\nIf you\'d ever like to try something similar, I\'d highly recommend going with friends. I think that having them along for protection, conversation, and general support could make it easier to expand your comfort zone.\n\nStay safe and have a nice day/night!', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'So I crossdressed for the ""real"" first time last night', 'created': 1469447587.0}"

2016-07-27 13:26:19,4uul5q,10,10,"I hope I phrased that right. I feel like this is a common issue with AFAB people - do I want to be seen in a masculine way because that is part of my identity, or because I'm sick of all the problems that being seen as a woman bring in my society? This is something I keep struggling with.

As I've grown up I've seen more and more acceptance of cis people expressing a ""feminine"" or ""masculine"" side. It's ok for a girl to wear masculine clothes and have a masculine haircut. We're still kinda not quite there on the other side of things but I think acceptance for men acting in feminine ways has at least improved. But especially focusing on the girl side of things, these expressions are accepted for people who still identify as women.

I grew up a tomboy, and gender really started to be an issue at puberty, but I don't know if it's really for the same reasons that would indicate I'm anything other than female. I remember crying the night my mom pointed out I was growing breasts. I don't hate my breasts now, but I think in that moment something in me knew I wasn't going to be seen the way I wanted anymore. I played water polo, and I dreaded when I would turn 14 and have to play with the girls only. This is when these thoughts really came up - I wished I could be a boy so I could have the same comraderie that the guys had with each other. I tried to recreate that with them but I knew they didn't look at me the same, especially in an environment where precieved gender is glaringly obvious at all times. But I worry that this is also because I was frequently bullied by girls and wanted friends in general.

I thought these feelings were gone when I left high school. I thought I finally accepted I could be seen as a girl, called a girl, but still be who I am. But more recently I'm finding that's just not working. 

I'd be fine dressing how I liked and looking how I wanted with no real effort toward presentation one way or the other if it didn't feel like everyone around me wanted to remind me that they see me as a girl all the time. It's in little things - my dad's fiancé saying that she'll help the girls in the family pick out dresses for the wedding before turning to me and saying I'm next for her to help, a friend tagging only me and my female friend in a picture of painted nails, people I play at mtg calling me ""lady"" and ""m'am"", people praising me for ""finally dressing like a girl"" when I dress up, female friends and family members talking about feminine things with ""oh you know how we women deal with our men"" or ""women's intuition"". I'm probably not making much sense.

But I feel like all of these can be explained away by me being some big feminist who is also obstinate and contrarian. 

But there's another part to it too - I've had some moments where I've been ""mistaken"" for masculine or middle of the road and enjoyed it. 

When I was 14 I went to the Costco bathrooms. My hair was short and I wore a thick swimmer coat. A woman stopped me on the way going ""hey! You're not supposed to be going in there!""

I told my parents about how funny it was and I remember my mom being really angry and I was just so happy for some reason. It's why I still remember it so clearly.

I've also had a lot of moments where people have told me I write men really well, how in my writing I can easily switch between perspectives of two genders. I've taken a bunch of tests that have often shown I'm in the middle and it makes me so happy (even though I don't really believe in the scientific validity of these tests)

I'd love to get an idea of what I might look like if I opted for either top surgery or at least some sort of reduction.  But I've not yet seen anyone my size or shape wearing a binder.  

I've heard good things about GC2B, and I'm thinking of making one of their binders the first one I try, but I really have no idea what I'm doing, here.  So I have a few questions for anyone who can help.

*  Binder measuring guide for GC2B states I should base my binder size on the measurement of my chest above the breasts/ across the armpit.  Which makes sense in general, but I'm worried that, since the difference between my upper chest/full bust measurement is a lot larger than normal, this might result in a binder that is full-on *painful* to wear.  How have other folks found the sizing?
*  Can a binder actually convincingly flatten a chest as large as mine?  Can the GC2B ones?
*  I have some sensory issues around clothing.  I don't mind tight foundation garments in some areas, but if waistbands and hems are too thin or bulky, that tends to be intolerable to me especially on tight-fitting things.  What are the edges of the GC2B binders like?  Are there other binders that might be better comfort-wise?
*  How long is the binding area of the binder?  The thing about tits this big is, they tend to be kinda *long* themselves.  So I'd need something that had a fairly deep binding section, lest I end up with my chest still jutting out... just halfway down my torso.
*  How *long* is the full-length binder?  I have a long torso, and nothing is as uncomfortable for me as something that ends too high up.  It's inevitably going to roll up awkwardly, feel uncomfortable and look kinda shitty on me.  Does this brand of binder come down nice and low - say mid-bottom hip?
*  Is there anything else I need to think about when buying a binder for myself?  I do not have access to anywhere I can shop *in person* for a binder, so I'm going to have to go online.",genderqueer,Have any plus-size and/or large-chested folks here tried the GC2B binders?

2016-07-29 16:25:22,4v7f9h,7,10," Hello. This will be very long to read. But i am really helpless and i hope you read till the end.

 I dont know how to explain myself. It is because my confusion, depression and some language barriers. I am from a conservative country which is located at middle east. and i am a 19 years old medical student. I am AFAB. I have been struggling this gender stuff for 2.5 years. I have never identified as female. I dont know what makes a person female or male. And I wonder if cis-females have that feeling saying ""YES I AM A FEMALE"".
 
 Firstly i want to talk about myself and my family. I have social fobia, chronic depression(which is really hard to me) and some strange behaviors i dont know how to put a name. For example i dont speak much, i am extremely shy and people always tell me that i always look nervous. I blame my family for these. I grew up a home with domestic violence. My family is hyper parents, they are strictly protective. They never let me have my own voice and choices. Even when I am 17 I couldnt stayed alone at home becuse they think i cant take care of myself. Of course these are not related with my gender but i think these are important in how i perceive my gender and how my gender makes me feel.
The problem is i dont know if i should go transitioning. I dont have any genderqueer friends. I talk to trans males. They tell me that they have always knew it that they were male. They were always into boys' stuff etc. I don't have these features and this makes me depressed. I feel like i dont fit trans community and i dont deserve to transition. Am i a lie? But i want flat chest, some body hair etc. ı see a therapist for being transgender and she asks me that normative questions that if i played with girls or boys. My answers do not fit the gender binary and she makes me feel like i am a liar. I have been aware of my attraction to women since i was at 8rd grade. I realised it when i first fall in loved with one of my classmates. I didn't had any statement about my sexuality before this. And my sexuality is the only thing i can be sure about myself. This example about my sexuality makes me think that way: I dont claim anything till i feel the need of it. Because I am too timid and too loser for such a thing. Because i am raised that way. As i told before i didn't have any ""the regular trans kids' awereness"" about my gender. But i have a butch appearance since 8th grade and i have been using a male name for 2 years. I dont want people to see me as female but i dont know what i feel about being seen as male. I have really feminine brain actually. I didnt have any recent relationship but i always only fall for straight girls. And all the straight girls are really normative here. I dont know, maybe this makes me want to go transition. When i dated a straight girl, i decided i want to be seen as male in my relationships. I dont mean being dominant. I actually dont know what this means but i want to be a ""boyfriend"". 
Another thing that makes me depressed is coming out. I am out as trans to all my friends. I dont give a shit about them. But my family is really big problem. The director of my dormitory (girls dormitory) outed me as trans male to my family just because i use a boys name. My mother tried to kill herself. My father dont know yet, if he learns, the domastic violence days start again. I made my mother to see a professional. She never accepts but she does not talk about my gender stuff. She still insists me on wearing skirts like nothing has happened. I can't come out as genderqueer. They would never understand. They will propose me to be an girly genderqueer or girly lesbian. Or accuse me of living a lie. 
  I don't know what i feel, i dont know if i think healty, i am always very sad and suicidal. I want to hear your opinions, advices and experiences.

2016-07-30 04:40:06,4vanbm,3,8,"Guessing you guys get a lot of these posts, but here's mine...

So as it stands, I'm AFAB and bisexual. I'm totally cool with being bi, that's pretty much said and done. I've assumed that I'm cis because being AFAB hasn't been upsetting to me.

However, once I came out as bi I figured I could be a little more open with my gender fuckery (as in before I came out I would try to dress 'straight', but now that I'm out I can dress and act 'queerer'). I've always dressed very tomboy-ish, (no makeup, jeans/shorts, simple hairstyles, etc) I recently started wearing baseball caps, and fell in love with the way they looked backwards. I loved the masculinity that it seemed to imply, I've been obsessed. I've even thought about purchasing a pair of boxer-briefs (they look so comfy, but I dunno how they work with AFAB anatomy). 

Lately I've had a fascination with suits. I've always felt uncomfortable getting all made-up for fancy events, and I don't like wearing dresses. I chalked that up to not being used to moving in flowy dresses and having fancy hair, and really disliking formal events in general. When I considered wearing a suit, though, things were different. I would love to rock a sharp suit to a formal event. I've even toyed with the idea of being a drag king.

That's the dress component, which isn't really confusing to me. What is confusing is this weird psychological aspect. When I swing (in attraction) to men, I want to act more masculine. I've looked up on several occasions how to walk/talk/act more masculine, but they weren't much help. In fact, they made me really uncomfortable. 

The things that irked me were how feminine some of my mannerisms were, and that irked me because it showed me I'm more feminine than I realized. I couldn't help but be a little jilted at that notion, but I couldn't put my finger on why. In the same vein, things that confirmed me as more masculine (or even androgynous) felt really nice in a way that I also can't really explain. I like being a little taller than average (and the consequent bigger hands and feet). I'd also prefer my voice to a little lower, but I've accepted that that is what it is.

I thought about it more, and found that I really object to being called cute, beautiful, or pretty. I prefer attractive, dapper, or sharp (though she/her pronouns still feel fine for some reason). I also don't like being called a woman, maybe it's because I'm not very ""mature"", but it doesn't sit right with me. 

I just...don't know. When I imagine being a guy, hanging out with other guys, that doesn't feel right. But in my experience, I don't have many shared experiences in terms of gender (besides, like, periods) with girls. 

I guess some guidance with this would be nice, but I mostly wanted to get this said.

Don't have physical dysphoria, but I do have an obsession with certain traits associated with masculinity (with only indifference for my feminine physical characteristics).**",genderqueer,Questioning?,1469878806.0,"{'created_utc': 1469853606, 'id': '4vanbm', 'num_comments': 3, 'score': 8, 'selftext': 'Guessing you guys get a lot of these posts, but here\'s mine...\n\nSo as it stands, I\'m AFAB and bisexual.

I\'ve always dressed very tomboy-ish, (no makeup, jeans/shorts, simple hairstyles, etc) I recently started wearing baseball caps, and fell in love with the way they looked backwards. I loved the masculinity that it seemed to imply, I\'ve been obsessed. I\'ve even thought about purchasing a pair of boxer-briefs (they look so comfy, but I dunno how they work with AFAB anatomy). \n\nLately I\'ve had a fascination with suits. I\'ve always felt uncomfortable getting all made-up for fancy events, and I don\'t like wearing dresses. I chalked that up to not being used to moving in flowy dresses and having fancy hair, and really disliking formal events in general. When I considered wearing a suit, though, things were different. I would love to rock a sharp suit to a formal event. I\'ve even toyed with the idea of being a drag king.\n\nThat\'s the dress component, which isn\'t really confusing to me. What is confusing is this weird psychological aspect. When I swing (in attraction) to men, I want to act more masculine. I\'ve looked up on several occasions how to walk/talk/act more masculine, but they weren\'t much help. In fact, they made me really uncomfortable. \n\nThe things that irked me were how feminine some of my mannerisms were, and that irked me because it showed me I\'m more feminine than I realized. I couldn\'t help but be a little jilted at that notion, but I couldn\'t put my finger on why. In the same vein, things that confirmed me as more masculine (or even androgynous) felt really nice in a way that I also can\'t really explain. I like being a little taller than average (and the consequent bigger hands and feet). I\'d also prefer my voice to a little lower, but I\'ve accepted that that is what it is.\n\nI thought about it more, and found that I really object to being called cute, beautiful, or pretty. I prefer attractive, dapper, or sharp (though she/her pronouns still feel fine for some reason). I also don\'t like being called a woman, maybe it\'s because I\'m not very ""mature"", but it doesn\'t sit right with me. \n\nI just...don\'t know. When I imagine being a guy, hanging out with other guys, that doesn\'t feel right. But in my experience, I don\'t have many shared experiences in terms of gender (besides, like, periods) with girls. \n\nI guess some guidance with this would be nice, but I mostly wanted to get this said.\n\n**TL;DR: Bi and AFAB. Don\'t have physical dysphoria, but I do have an obsession with certain traits associated with masculinity (with only indifference for my feminine physical characteristics).**', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Questioning?', 'created': 1469878806.0}"

I'm having a specific problem in dating and relationships.  I'm 35, and I tend to look much younger than I am, often as much as 10 years younger.  The people I've dated have mostly been cis women who go for feminine guys, with one bi person who dated mostly women, and one nonbinary pan person.  I'm mostly attracted to women.  When I was younger I dated more people closer to my age, but these days I'm most attracted to people who are around 20-28ish.  The age disparity is causing several problems for me:

* I meet a lot of women who initially seem interested in me, but many tell me that they would never date someone as old as me.
* I now have a zero or near-zero positive response rate on dating sites / apps (in the past I've met people off Okcupid with sometimes good results).  I've gotten messages on Okcupid from women who explicitly told me that they thought I was lying about my age, and my friends have told me that if they saw me on Tinder and didn't know me, they'd probably think I had lied about my age too, based on my pics.  I'm not sure if there's any way for me to actually use these sites / apps with this problem.
* I have been getting frustrated when I connect on deep intellectual and emotional levels with younger women, and then I see them turn around and date men closer to their age or even younger, who don't seem as mature or intelligent, or when I meet someone and then find out that she is into casual sex.  (I'm open to people in loving polyamorous relationships, or people who have sex outside of relationships, but I don't want to date people who are into casual sex or anonymous / drunk sex.)
* I meet very few single people close to my age that I find attractive, and when I do, they usually seem uninterested in me and I find it even hard to get to know or form friendships with these people.
* The dynamic of me being attracted to younger women is one way in which my sexuality plays out like a ""typical straight male"", if that makes sense?  But I find that this then feeds into a lot of social norms that I feel uncomfortable with the gender dynamics of, because I don't like playing the stereotypically male role in relationships or sexual interactions.  I have a strong desire for symmetry and equality, and I like switching roles and playing both roles as much as possible.  Being interested in younger women, I find places me in a role where I'm expected to take greater initiative, and that plays off my insecurities.  I also have a deep insecurity about being perceived as creepy or threatening, and the age difference in attraction also plays into this insecurity.

Has anyone here struggled with any of these things?  Or even if you haven't, are there any ideas or insights you could share that could help me to navigate these issues?
