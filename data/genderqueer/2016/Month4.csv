2016-04-01 04:47:09,4ctzk7,13,14,"(Posted this in /r/asktransgender yesterday but didn't really get any replies so I'll post it here instead. Hope that's OK.)

I'm not sure about the exact label yet but I'm pretty sure I'm agender (or some kind of strange mixture of man and woman, but most likely agender) and I feel like I should probably tell my boyfriend about it. We've been together for many years now and even though I've thought about both my gender identity and sexuality for years, it's not until the past half a year that I've really been questioning, doing research, and learning about these parts of myself. Last month I told my boyfriend I'm probably bisexual and that was scary enough. Telling him that I'm non-binary seems *even scarier*.

How do I tell my boyfriend, who thinks of me as a woman, that I don't really identify as a woman? I have no problem with female pronouns but *I don't feel like a woman*. Not entirely anyway. There's some kind of indescribable disconnect between my assigned sex/gender and how I really feel. How do I tell my boyfriend, who likes my female body, that a big goal of mine is to one day go through a breast reduction (not remove them completely) so that I can look more androgynous? It will sound absolutely *ridiculous* to someone who isn't familiar with the world of non-binary (it's still difficult for *me* to fully understand it all, and I *am* non-binary).

And then there's this tiny ""voice"" in the back of my mind that tells me I'm probably imagining everything and that I'm as cisgender as can be. Stupid thought since I got happy when someone thought I was a boy when I was 10 years old and since I remember asking myself *""why don't I feel like a woman?""* as far back as 13 years ago.

I never learned about everything that isn't cisgender when I grew up and honestly didn't educate myself on the matter until 6 months ago, which is crazy. I've referred to myself as ""mentally androgynous"" for *years* (though that's not the correct term) without knowing there is actually a name for what I've felt my whole life. Learning about all of this has made me feel really confused and anxious but at the same time liberated in some way. It's like my world view has broadened and like I suddenly feel like it's OK to be me. Does that make sense? I'd like to share that with my boyfriend (I also think he has the right to know), but I'm scared of how he's going to react.

Any advice?

Also, I feel like I should add two things: 1) I don't want to transition since I don't identify as male (though I'd rather be male if I could choose). I do, however, want to keep dressing androgynously and I want to have a breast reduction. 2) I came out as non-binary for the first time ever a couple of days ago. I told a good friend of mine and she was great about it. Doubt my boyfriend will be as understanding as she was.

2016-04-01 22:55:26,4cyokj,20,8,"My partner and I really enjoy watching cartoons together, because they're easy to fit into our schedules and they're a nice way to relax and enjoy something together. However, we've found it pretty common for these sorts of shows to have really uncomfortable, unnecessary, and/or stereotypical gender references that really jar us and make it hard to enjoy the show. Do you all have suggestions towards cartoons (or similar media) in which this isn't the case?

Positive example: we really liked Steven Universe and are eagerly awaiting new episodes. Gender exists in the show, but is rarely referenced and almost never in context of stereotypes. There is a character that is pretty clearly nonbinary, which is cool.

Negative examples:

1. In Gravity Falls, one of the villians (Gideon) is male but is consistantly derided by some of the main characters (esp. Stan) for acting and looking ""girly"". Additionally, one of the early episodes has one of the main characters (Dipper) being upset and made-fun-of for not being ""manly"".   
2. In Avatar: The Last Airbender, one of the main characters (Sokka) often makes comments about not expect not expecting ""girls"" to be good warriors and generally reinforces stereotypical gender roles. Even when he is proven wrong (e.g. is captured by a group of female warriors), it feels awkward and unnecessary that this is used as a source of comic relief.

I gave the examples that I did because these were particularly surprising/annoying to me, as these are popular and highly praised shows. I know there are a lot that are much worse about this, but the fact that I otherwise like a lot about Avatar and Gravity Falls makes it partiularly upsetting that I can't enjoy them properly because of their gender references.

First would like to say that love you and I think you are fantastic parents. I don’t know how else to say this then to get down to the truth that is I am Genderqueer, (more specifically agender) . As you have been having issue with my gender for a while and this what I have concluded I felt like this me your child and this my gender.
What is Genderqueer? 
Genderqueer (GQ), also termed non-binary or gender-expansive, is acatch-all category for gender identities that are not exclusively masculine or feminine—identities which are thus outside of the gender binary and cisnormativity. Genderqueer people may identify as one or more of the following:
•	having an overlap of, or indefinite lines between, gender identity; 
•	having two or more genders (being bigender, trigender, orpangender);
•	having no gender (being agender, nongendered, genderless, genderfree or neutrois); This is me
•	moving between genders or having a fluctuating gender identity (genderfluid); 
•	being third gender or other-gendered, a category which includes those who do not place a name to their gender
(source: Wikipedia)
  
Will this change me in anyway as your child?
As your child, no I am still the same person as yesterday. No this does not change me in anyway

Will I do anything to change my appearance in any way? 
At this moment no, expect grow my hair out and that about it for now. In the future I might go on hormones but that would still be a couple years away. In the meantime, (so like the next year) I might change passport gender and name and that is it. I might dress more femininely however probably not around you guys as it awkward for you (I would, so when I am back in New Zealand. As identify more towards femininity. 

I am Trans? 
Yes, however as I will tell I am agender, I don’t identify as either however I am more inclined towards femininity.
 
Is this Phase? 
No, I have felt consciously that I am trans (yet not knowing exactly where I was on the gender spectrum) for the last 4 years however unconsciously I have always felt different from the gender I was born with.  

I am transsexual? 
No, and no I am probably never getting sex change operation, it not for me. 

Could I change my mind? 
Unlikely, however yes, it does happen and if it does then I will face that obstacle when it comes. 

What pronoun and name to use? 
I know this may be difficult for you guys and probably will cause you guys the most animosity however, I would greatly respect if you called me G from now on and you either used Gender Neutral pronouns (They and them) or female (her and she). Even though it would deeply upset me and disappoint me, I would understand if guys still used male pronoun and called me George. However again it would deeply upset and disappoint me   
     
Do I know it is Hard? 
Yes, I do for both sides. I know you worry that this makes me a target for to pick on, however I thought about this hard and carefully for 8 months when I came to conclusion that I am genderqueer. I have thought about the pros and cons and I think in end this better for overall happiness, as I would rather not pretend to be something I am not.  

What now? 
Nothing, you know what I would like that can ask you for to respect my wishes and I hope this covered what you need to know however if you any more questions, I am happy to answer them and if you want more information. I can give you a couple websites. But you have to come and ask me about it. I won’t chase you about this letter. If you would you could forget that this letter ever existed however again this would deeply upset me and disappoint me.
I am also more than happy to bring this wish up with My psychiatrist in the next session. And no she does not know about this letter, we don’t really talk about it much.

Genderqueer people may identify as one or more of the following:\n•\thaving an overlap of, or indefinite lines between, gender identity; \n•\thaving two or more genders (being bigender, trigender, orpangender);\n•\thaving no gender (being agender, nongendered, genderless, genderfree or neutrois); This is me\n•\tmoving between genders or having a fluctuating gender identity (genderfluid); \n•\tbeing third gender or other-gendered, a category which includes those who do not place a name to their gender\n(source: Wikipedia)\n  \nWill this change me in anyway as your child?\nAs your child, no I am still the same person as yesterday. No this does not change me in anyway\n\nWill I do anything to change my appearance in any way? \nAt this moment no, expect grow my hair out and that about it for now. In the future I might go on hormones but that would still be a couple years away. In the meantime, (so like the next year) I might change passport gender and name and that is it. I might dress more femininely however probably not around you guys as it awkward for you (I would, so when I am back in New Zealand. As identify more towards femininity. \n\nI am Trans? \nYes, however as I will tell I am agender, I don’t identify as either however I am more inclined towards femininity.\n \nIs this Phase? \nNo, I have felt consciously that I am trans (yet not knowing exactly where I was on the gender spectrum) for the last 4 years however unconsciously I have always felt different from the gender I was born with.  \n\nI am transsexual? \nNo, and no I am probably never getting sex change operation, it not for me. \n\nCould I change my mind? \nUnlikely, however yes, it does happen and if it does then I will face that obstacle when it comes. \n\nWhat pronoun and name to use? \nI know this may be difficult for you guys and probably will cause you guys the most animosity however, I would greatly respect if you called me G from now on and you either used Gender Neutral pronouns (They and them) or female (her and she). Even though it would deeply upset me and disappoint me, I would understand if guys still used male pronoun and called me George. However again it would deeply upset and disappoint me   \n     \nDo I know it is Hard? \nYes, I do for both sides. I know you worry that this makes me a target for to pick on, however I thought about this hard and carefully for 8 months when I came to conclusion that I am genderqueer. I have thought about the pros and cons and I think in end this better for overall happiness, as I would rather not pretend to be something I am not.  \n\nWhat now? \nNothing, you know what I would like that can ask you for to respect my wishes and I hope this covered what you need to know however if you any more questions, I am happy to answer them and if you want more information. I can give you a couple websites. But you have to come and ask me about it. I won’t chase you about this letter. If you would you could forget that this letter ever existed however again this would deeply upset me and disappoint me.\nI am also more than happy to bring this wish up with My psychiatrist in the next session.

2016-04-03 20:43:56,4d7u4i,5,3,"First off, I want to make it clear that I don't mean to offend any individual and that I have nothing but the utmost respect for people of all walks of life. However, I'm still learning about a lot of things related to gender, sexuality, etc. and I may perhaps word something in a way that may or may not be the most precise or effective - and if I offend anyone, I apologize! Teach me! 

Alright, disclaimer out of the way, I have recently - as recently as this weekend - matched with another person on an app and I find them really attractive. To bring context to this, I'm a cisgender, straight male. I'm looking to find a lovely girl to spend time with and shower with adoration, lol. However, this person I matched with had genderqueer in their profile, but I didn't really mind. You see my mind just focused on their appearance at the time. When we started talking I wanted to be respectful so the first thing I did was ask what pronouns I may use to refer to them (which, to quote this person, got me bonus points haha). The response I am not sure what to think about or how to respond to - he refers to himself as he, and not she. 

So here I am - I need advice. This isn't the first time something similar like this happened to me, but I'm really interested in this person and I don't know what to feel or think?? I have a lot of questions. Last semester I took a class on gender, sexuality, sex, etc. and learned a lot. It was really eye opening and tough to go through, coming from a heteronormative society teaching one thing and suddenly being exposed to new concepts and ideas that go contrary to what I've grown up understanding and feeling. I am burning with questions. 

I'd like to first verify my understanding - sex refers to the physical assignment of an individual based on characteristics like the presence of specific genetailia or body features; gender is the mental concept one has of oneself - how they see themselves and how they identify. Third, presentation is how one chooses to present themselves outwardly, through action, dress, etc. and it need not conform to their sex or gender. Sexual orientation is one's sexual preference or attraction - a tendency towards femininity or masculinity.

Please correct my understanding if I'm wrong above - it's probably important I get my knowledge right before I make assumptions. 

Anyway, back to my problem. My biggest one - how does the concept of sexual orientation hold in a landscape where gender identity isn't cut and dry? Is sexual orientation at all concerned with gender, or is it purely a physical thing?? 

I don't understand how to react to my situation - I am attracted to this person because what my brain sees in his pictures is a beautiful girl. But he tells me to refer to him as a he. What does that make me?? Am I straight because I'm attracted to the feminine qualities of the individual? Or does his label put a spin on who I am?? Furthermore how should I proceed? What if I end up really liking this person? He'll want me to continue using the 'he' pronoun, but I don't feel comfortable with the idea of telling my parents or friends oh yeah, I'm dating this person and they identify as male. Naturally then the question falls on what that makes me - but I genuinely don't now or ever have had an attraction to men. Nor do I ever intend on being with a man. But my eyes don't see a guy, I see a girl! And I'm afraid that makes me a bad person but I can't help it - so now I'm thinking like what does it even mean to be one or the other- and like how do labels like ""gay"" or ""straight"" even exist in a context where masculine individuals can identify as girls and feminine individuals can  identify as males. It takes all meaning out of the statement ""I'm not into dudes"" doesn't it?

34 years old/CA/not really a baby girl skunk, I was just looking at pictures of baby skunks when I made the user name. Aww.
Anyway.
So I've made a lot of progress in the past couple of days. I asked some questions on here at this sub as well as the Ask Transgender sub and Genderqueer, about low-dose T, top surgery, and all that. People have been really helpful which is great. I live in the Bay Area so I called the Pacific Center yesterday and will be going to a group therapy session/meeting for genderqueer and non-binary folks this coming week.
Then I called Lyon Martin, an LGBTQ+ health clinic, and got an appointment for medical care for next month as well as left a voicemail for their mental health department to get a gender therapist.
THEN, today, I spoke with Dr. Mosser's surgery clinic about top surgery and scheduled a free consultation for June because YOLO.
So I did all this and I've been trying to open up to people in my life a little more about how I'm feeling. On some level I feel this weird sort of giddy liberation. And I'm probably just emotionally exhausted after taking all these giant steps, but for whatever reason, instead of feeling happy and positive and liberated to be figuring this shit out, I also just feel:
sad that I didn't do this sooner.
sad that I feel this way at all.
sad that it's gotten worse over the years instead of better.
cheated out of a real childhood (I am FAAB and hit puberty at basically age 10, so there went that. got my period and then started growing boobs and I hated it and just felt like I would never be the same).
exhausted by the hat0rade I have run across on the Internet about gender-variant folks.
terrified of telling my parents any of this, yet feeling like I should include them in at least SOME statement about, ""Hi, I don't really think of myself as being 100% female and never have. It's okay if you keep calling me my name and using female pronouns and calling me your daughter because I am okay with being those things to you and I love you. But I just wanted to tell you my real feelings because I did not want to leave you completely out of such an important part of my life.""
really worried that there is something else chemically off with me that's somehow causing this, like borderline personality disorder or something. Or some manic episode or PMDD. I have not been diagnosed with any of these things but I am just not trusting my own feelings all of a sudden. Like what if I'm wrong about all this? What if I go back?
But I can't go back.
And god dammit, why should I, so I can keep being miserable and dysphoric and weird about everything for ANOTHER 20 years? Aw hell no.
So why can't I just be happy that I'm on this journey? Why am I so afraid?

Last night when I was finally able to fall asleep I had some odd dreams. I have already had dreams about wearing female things before that even arouse me sexually a lot (also during sleep). Back in the day I also crossdressed but I haven't since some months now.
So last night I was dreaming that I was buying a bra with my mum (as a guy) and it felt very good doing that. For some odd reason the bra we bought was made of bread. I know that doesnt make any sense and I have no idea what my mind wants to tell me with that. 
However later on I was with 2 girls from my class and I remember watching in a mirror seeing me with a full makeover and long hair, it looked beautiful.

I don't really know what to do right now.

I would not want to transition but I like the idea of having boobs. I don't always feel this female thrift, mostly when I am alone and have nothing to do.

The ideal scenario would be that I would come together with this girl I have a huge crush on and she understands my feelings and we can do girly things together as well.

However the best thing I can do right now is to do the things that feel right for me and not to care about labels too much.

2016-04-10 16:12:15,4e6cnh,18,18,"Hey there :) I'm 28, MTF.

I found out about this whole transgender thing in December. At first I had some resistance but then... Well, last month I got started with the lasering, got an androgynous-ish style haircut, scheduled a medic appointment to see about HRT. I've discussed things with my wife (we have no idea about the future but our hearts are in the right place), I planned my future wardrobe, and picked a female name I like.

But then it hit me: 

* I'll be going from cis-white-guy to the most picked on demographic there is. 

* I'm good looking now and who knows, I might turn out a rather ugly lady on the other side. 

* I'll have a pile of legal issues with regards to the name change (yay third world). 

* There's a good chunk of family I'm sure will write me off as dead after all this.

* As a woman I better brush up on my self defense skills.

* In the future if I'm ever dating or looking for a job... good luck.

I could go on forever. 

All of this got me wondering. Why is it that so much of my well being is tied to whether I look like a man or a woman? Intellectually it makes no sense to me. I've discussed this with both my wife and my therapist, and the best we could come up with was that it's a self-esteem issue. It still makes no sense to me. It sounds so shallow and superficial. It's not who I am to put looks on top of the list so much. (Which I almost did on the list above, I know.) I don't get it.

After (*if?*) I'm 100% passable some of the problems will hopefully disappear and I'll just blend in with the crowd. But I don't know. I'm scared.

I'm Jamie Tristan Folaigh, or at least that's what I'm feeling right now. All three names are ""fictions"" though, with one being a last name specifically created for social media purposes.

I'm 26, AMAB, and genderfluid, pronouns don't matter. I'm clearly AMAB if you see me in person, but I don't always identify with ""he/him"" pronouns, hence the username (genderfluid*chick*, I strongly prefer the idea of expressing myself typically middle ground, but having a center that is more feminine of center than masculine of center, if that makes sense).

I've always felt like I didn't connect fully with guys or girls in a consistent manner. My first big indication that I was different was, at a young age, like six, I distinctly remember that I didn't like the word ""handsome"" being applied to me. Looking back at old photos, there might be a slight confirmation bias being applied, but I can see why kids might have wondered if I was gay or something.

I know that I'm not gay, not because I can't find guys attractive, I just can't see myself sleeping with one. In that same vein, I don't recall looking at girls the same way I remember hearing guys talk about them.

For as long as I can remember, I have found things like girls jeans and underwear to be more comfortable, and have desired a more middle-ground or even slightly feminine presentation (like, sometimes, using girly tops or skirts and stuff). I know that pushing the envelope too far is impossible given certain physical attributes I have (thinning hair, kinda masculine shoulder build, kinda masculine face).

Perhaps the biggest things that block me from pushing the envelope too far are the aforementioned physical issues (which aren't that big a deal in the long run) for one. For another there is the fact that my social network is composed entirely of people who know me as a guy and would probably be destroyed if I was to come out in this manner. That and the idea that, even though I am not too far from Atlanta, I am far enough from it that people (including potential romantic interests) would tend to not be interested in me (and, I feel, potentially aggressive) if I was to come out in this manner.

I’ve gone into this room to meditate. The world is spinning around me and I feel free and high. I fall to the floor and hit my head.

I stand up, I know I have to open the closet, but I’m terrified. I finally open it and inside half buried In a pile of junk is a scene girl. Very slender with pink hair and a lip ring. She’s laughing at me.

I yank her out of the closet and begin to tickle her, hard, more like trying to stab her with my fingertips rather than trying to make her laugh. She laughs anyway.

A man shows up, curly brown hair. Bright blue eyes and a thin beard lining his jaw he takes the girl and sort of engulfs her. The merge into one.

I'm currently on low AAs and low E. And while that's great. My itty bitty titties do on occasion give me anxiety and make me worry about them getting bigger. 

The alternative is to go on a tiny (and potentially ineffectual) level of AAs or stop completely. I tried a lowish dose of AAs for a while and all i got were hot flushes, a short temper and mood swings. 

I'm afraid of stopping altogether because i honestly can't remember how i felt when i wasn't surpressing T. I remember being horny a lot but that was about it. Also, masculinising isn't my idea of a super fun time. 

So I'm kind of stuck. I kind of have to come to terms with either solution. Unless SERMs become an option, but I'm not holding my breath. 

What doesn't help with this is that my gender is really incongruent. I identify as a woman a majority of the time, but dont have too much of a problem with my androgynously male body. On top of that, my voice im pretty fine with. I like it and i like my singing voice. I don't want to change that. But if i continue to feminise and then present as femme more, that too will be jarring and that worries me. I feel like it'd make me uncomfortable, but maybe that's me being stupid. 

It just gets harder to pin down what path feels right, i feel like there are so many parts of me pulling me in different directions. 

At the start of the year my therapist and I sort of said that i should I should try and be okay with my inconsistency and flux. But that was on my AA dose that gave me a near constant state of puberty blues and general shittiness. So that was short lived.

My manager and I have a good rapport and have had some pretty deep conversations in the past. Because of everything I've been questioning/going through, I decided maybe I should just say something and get it over with. So um, I did. It was far from my usual eloquence and poise, but I didn't burst out sobbing and when we were wrapping up our conversation, he said he was thankful and honored that I trusted him to talk about this stuff with him, and then asked if there was anything I needed at this point. I said I'm still feeling that out, but thanked him for asking. 

I'm simultaneously overjoyed, scared to death, and profoundly grateful that we live in a society which is slowly learning to accept this. I also feel so exhausted. Is it normal to be like, COMPLETELY WIPED OUT when you first start figuring these things out about yourself? I could seriously sleep for days, yet I also feel sort of jittery and almost euphoric and definitely relieved. It's weird as hell. I identified as FTM almost 10 years ago and then got scared and went back in the goddamn closet for pretty much the worst 10 years of my life. I keep worrying that what if this is just a ""phase"" again?

Is it normal to have flashes of, ""maybe/what if I'm wrong?"" to worry about what others will think or how it'll turn out, to worry you won't be the same and that you're changing a part of yourself that isn't ""supposed"" to be changed? Is it normal to be afraid? 

Please tell me your Coming Out At Work/To Family stories, especially if you consider yourself non-binary/genderqueer. I'm kinda overwhelmed by how much more real this feels now. And I am TERRIFIED of telling my parents, that's the other thing.

I also feel so exhausted. Is it normal to be like, COMPLETELY WIPED OUT when you first start figuring these things out about yourself? I could seriously sleep for days, yet I also feel sort of jittery and almost euphoric and definitely relieved. It\'s weird as hell. I identified as FTM almost 10 years ago and then got scared and went back in the goddamn closet for pretty much the worst 10 years of my life. I keep worrying that what if this is just a ""phase"" again?\n\nIs it normal to have flashes of, ""maybe/what if I\'m wrong?"" to worry about what others will think or how it\'ll turn out, to worry you won\'t be the same and that you\'re changing a part of yourself that isn\'t ""supposed"" to be changed? Is it normal to be afraid? \n\nPlease tell me your Coming Out At Work/To Family stories, especially if you consider yourself non-binary/genderqueer. I\'m kinda overwhelmed by how much more real this feels now. And I am TERRIFIED of telling my parents, that\'s the other thing. \n\nOn a positive note, I think I may have finally found a therapist!

2016-04-19 21:58:48,4fk0vm,35,34,"(Excuse the long off-my-chest post as I try to write my feelings out for myself.)

I'm baffled by gender and I'm baffled by my identity.

I'm female and I like girls. I'm 22. I've never understood what it means to be a woman or feel like one. I've also never really understood what it means to be a man. Everyone I know easily (and sometimes strongly) identifies with their sex, gender, and sexuality and I feel like I'm left out, confused, and frustrated.

I want to be one or the either but I feel stifled and conflicted and depressed when I'm forced into one box or the other. I don't want to go by alternative pronouns and be referred to as some ""other"".

But when people refer to me as a girl I feel awkward. They're not wrong... But they're not quite right either? I'm completely fine with being identified as a daughter and a sister, but being a girl and a woman is something weird and almost distant to me. It's not the social roles or expectations of girls/women that bother me as some people have asked me -- I don't give a flying fuck about those and have disregarded them from the time I was little (""I do what I want, bitch"" is generally my philosophy).

When I was in middle/high school I thought I was FtM transgender. If I wasn't a girl, surely I was a boy? My parents sent me to a counselor (not to punish me, but so that I could talk through my feelings and due to other depression-related reasons) and I was talked into? identifying as a lesbian.

So I carried along in my high school years as a fairly closeted ""butchy"" lesbian still fairly uncomfortable with myself but happier that I had some kind of label. I still felt awkward about my body (particularly my chest), about using the bathrooms and locker-rooms, and being assigned in girl-boy arrangements.

And then here comes college. I go away from my home in little ol' Vermont to Montana to try and catch a breath of fresh air and some change. Without my mother's nitpicking on what I wear I bought a new wardrobe of masculine/men's clothing, a proper binder (or two), and for the first time in a while felt more content and happy with myself looking how I wanted to look. I was still in the closet to the outside world regarding anything and everything but I joined the university's queer alliance club and finally got to interact with more than just a handful of LGBTQ identifying folk. I didn't know how to identify myself to the group and shirked away from any further labels but I made a few friends. People within the group assumed I was FtM transgender due to the way I dressed, talked, and carried myself however I shied away from identifying myself as such. I wasn't a butch lesbian because lesbians, even butch, intrinsically identify as women but I didn't quite feel transgender either as I didn't really care about what was between my legs and if people referred to me as male or female.

I had to leave Montana and come back to Vermont as I couldn't cope with the harassment I was experiencing. My parents were more accepting of how I presented myself (not that they never didn't accept me, but I think my mom had difficulty accepting her oldest daughter wasn't the feminine princess she had when I was 2-6 years old). I was happy doing whatever the fuck I wanted.

This past year I tried, I really really tried, experimenting with my femininity. I grew my hair out for the first time since I was 9 years old. I dabbled in make-up. I bought more feminine clothing. It was fun, don't get me wrong, to play with make-up and make myself look like this bizarre foreign being and dressing up in pretty clothes. I don't mind too much wearing dresses to formal/business events as long as the dress is ""my style"" (conservative, plain, solid colors, a-line). But what I didn't realize until I cut my hair short again recently is that every time I looked in the mirror I was looking at a stranger. A pretender. I don't know how to describe it, it's not like hair or dressing a certain way should really *matter* if I'm happy with myself or know who I am, but it didn't make me feel like me and it made me depressed. It was fun for a while and then it became a burden and an expectation.

I cut my hair short again and I looked in the mirror. There was the boy-ish androgynous face I knew looking back at me. My hair cut and styled how I always had it. A sports bra to diminish my breasts and a dumb t-shirt. There was me again. But at the same time... What am I?

I feel like a nothing. Like a blank person. I tell my friends that ""I'm just me!"" but feeling like you have no real identity sucks, as much as I claim not to care.

* Emo
* Long hair with no bangs, layering, or other styling
* Medium-short hair that for some reason is categorized as ""long""

The thing is, I'm very attached to my bangs and the way they fall across my forehead. I want to have my hair long and also have bangs. Why is that not a style that guys have? Why is it that when I asked about fringe on a men's long hair thread, I was immediately told to avoid it? Why are men's sections on hair websites a tiny fraction of the length of women's sections? Why, oh why, does sexism extend into hair????

But back to my original question: do you think it's possible for a transmasculine person like me to pass with bangs? And what recommendations do you have for styling the bangs so they look more masculine?

I'm AFAB agender, and I'm struggling to present myself in a suitably androgynous way.  I have a lot going for me in this department - I'm slim, my facial features are rather androgynous, and I've worked on my body posture and voice that they're fairly inbetweeny.

My issue is my breasts.  And I know what you're thinking!  ""Wear a binder, dummy!"" Yeah, yeah, I know.  I hear you.  I've shopped around, read a lot about them.  They seem fantastic and they would suit my purposes wonderfully. BUT!  But.  I like my breasts.  They're small unobtrusive bouncy fun balls.  And I can cover them up easily enough with loose clothes.  But I hate the idea of covering them up.  I dunno...I was SO HAPPY to get them in the first place!  They're pretty much my favorite thing about being a phenotypical girl.

So I feel like this weird sense of betrayal in squishing them down and hiding them.  But if I don't, I get read as a girl.

I realize this is a stupid problem.  And I realize I should just get a binder.  But I guess I'm just hoping to hear from people with either similarly minded people, or folks who differ and can give me a new perspective.  All constructive feedback is appreciated.
