I found this sub a few days ago, so I'm hoping you could help. 

So... I'm a 17 year old from Ireland (not exactly open to trans/non-binary yet). I was born a male (MAAB, if I'm right with the terminology). I've never really been 'boy-ish', whatever that entails. I've never felt like a 'man' - well, seldom. 

A few years ago, I identified as a bisexual male and that was all well and good until the last few months. 

The last few months in particular  have been odd. I've been feeling a lot more feminine. There is one moment (of a good few) I remember vividly too. I was walking home and I just felt like a woman... It was weird. 

A few months ago, I started to shave my body hair. I loathe the little that I have. My legs in particular. I just hate it. (I'm going on holidays soon with family, so have to let my leg hair grow again...) I started to paint my nails too. I did just two on my hand on night... And then my toenails (easy to conceal) another. And I was fairly comfortable with it.  And sometimes I look in the mirror and I think I look and feel like a girl. 

I've started to consider experimenting. I guess right now a more accurate identity would be questioning. I go (well, I went - we just graduated) to an all boys school so I could never get away with a thing. 

So... I guess what I'm asking is what can I to help me try figure out... 'what' I am. Preferably discrete as possible. And any advice in general, please. What sort of things should I do to experiment. I feel sort of lost and confused. And I've probably left bits out but...

I'm a 20-year-old MAAB and have been taking anti-androgens for around 4 months. I'm aware of the health risks of taking spiro alone and so I think I need to decide fairly soon whether to come off it or take E also. Hopefully there's a third option? But if not, I could use some advice to help me decide.

Around 7 years ago, I was a 14-year-old teenager swimming in hormones and I realised I'm attracted to men. I thought this would fix my weird feelings around women - that I was previously trying to fit a certain behaviour and I wouldn't have to do that any more. It didn't. I thought on it a while and realised these feelings were jealously, of the intense, dysphoric variety. This set off a serious depression which led to me developing OCD and coming very close to suicide. In order to get out of this hole, I pushed my gender feelings to the back of my mind and basically punished myself whenever they came to the forefront. 

Around a year ago, I allowed myself to analyse it from a distance and decide whether I wanted to act on it. I thought and hesitated for a long time before buying makeup and nail polish online while drunk. I had some fun with that and felt a little better about looking in the mirror for the first time in a long time. Around this time, I received a few comments on my thinning hair and, half-panicked and drunk again, I bought the spiro. The next morning I figured I would stick it in a drawer somewhere and think it over a bit more but I found myself so excited when it came that I started that day. 

Over the past 4 months, I have found myself getting more comfortable with being feminine in public (in actions, not dress) and I like that it has taken the testosterone edge off my thoughts and feelings. Overall, I'd rate my experience on spiro very highly, but I'll probably feel differently if I end up with osteoporosis or liver damage, hence the post.

I recently took the [COGIATI](http://transsexual.org/cogiati_english.html) test, which I decided not to take too seriously as it doesn't seem too scientific but it did help me find my place on the gender spectrum. It had me at around 100 - on the feminine end of androgyne, almost into the 'Probably Transsexual' category. I agree entirely with this but my problem is, I don't know what to do about it now. 

My ideal situation would be to be born female, with two X chromosomes and a uterus. In the absence of a genie, this is not an option. My second choice would be to be androgynous but presenting more feminine, almost tomboyish. I would be pretty happy to wake up and be smooth as a Barbie doll, but there we have the genie problem of before. I'm not too keen on the idea of full-blown transsexualism, as the HRT requires too much hoop-jumping (the NHS will make you live full time as a woman, which I don't want to do) and is too expensive and dangerous to self-med.

**In summary, I think I'm feminine-androgynous but don't know what to do about this shitty, awful fucking testosterone.**

I just say I\'m gender fluid because that\'s what fits best but I want to know who I really am. :/\n\nThanks for any advice :)', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': ""I know I'm gender queer but I'm not sure in what way?

2014-06-10 17:13:04,27su5n,12,17,"I am debating how I related to gender and would like your feedback. 

I was an emotional little boy who was told repeatedly that boys don't cry, how to act like a man, and I did. I turned off emotion, never expressed vulnerability, didn't let anyone in who may see my gender non-conforming thoughts. I knew I had sexual interests that deviated from these masculine expectations, bisexuality, kink and a desire to submit. I was shamed by this and repressed it as best I could and lived and appeared undeniably masculine. 

It wasn't until my late 30's that I opened up to the realities of sex, sexuality, gender and relationships and accepted that I was bi, that I had non-conforming kinks, that I liked anal play and had a sexuality that transcended my penis as a sole source of pleasure. Once I broke from this need to conform to a heterosexual masculine social construct I allowed myself to become vulnerable, express emotion, simply to be myself and be less concerned with how I *should* act. 

So my question is, does rejecting a gender binary make me genderqueer if I haven't changed how I present myself? As a cis-male in my 40's, married to a woman, kids, suburbs, I feel like a fraud to identify as other than male; though I reject the premise of what ""male"" is preferring to be myself. I am socializing more in a sex-positive world and enjoying the opportunity to be open about and experience my bisexual, kinky, and polyamorous sides and as I meet more people who identify outside of the gender binary it is unclear to me where I belong in terms of gender. 

tl:dr: If I present myself as male, am fine with being a man but reject the social construct of what it means to be a man and embrace feminine traits does this make me genderqueer or just an open minded man who has transcended the imposition of a masculinity defined by others?

Thank you so much for sharing your experiences, I have been reading for the last few days and I feel really touched by the positivity in this community. 

I will keep it somewhat short, I am Mi'kmaq, Oji-Cree, and Métis. My people are very open to different gender identities, sexualities, etc. In fact non-gender conforming or non-heterosexual people are cherished because their identity is a sacred gift. So when I found out how much hate and prejudice LGBTQ2 people face in the dominant North American culture I was horrified. I grew up very poor, and in a violent neighbourhood and experienced a lot of trauma. Ever since, I have felt quite scared about discussing my gender identity with people that are non-Indigenous, because I fear they will be bigotted and hateful towards non-gender conforming ideas/feelings. Now I work in community service/youth programming for Indigenous youth mostly, dealing with violence prevention, gender, tolerance, empowering, etc. I finally feel like I can open up to myself I guess?

I don't really know how to describe my feelings around my gender. Sometimes I feel very connected to my womanhood, and other times I feel gender-neutral or genderless I guess? I feel like I sort of float around feminine side of the spectrum, and sometimes I don't identify as man or woman. Is that anyone else's experience? Is it appropriate to identify for me to identify as genderqueer?

Throughout most of my life, I've been very girly.. up until I realized that a lot of my anxiety and a lot of the awful relationships that I've been in have been wrapped up in this extreme feminine performance because I felt like my desirability and value were dependent on it.

2014-06-22 05:43:46,28rytc,11,6,"Hi all,

As my flair notes, and as i've described in more detail in [this old blog post of mine](http://flexibeast.dreamwidth.org/136258.html), i'm transgenderqueer and pansexual. i'm also nonmonogamous and highly sexual, and very much crave sexual play with people other than my long-term partners. However, i have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, and am an introvert (by which i most definitely don't mean ""shy""!), such that meeting people in sensory-overload public environments like clubs and bars isn't a practical option for me.

So i try to meet people online for recreational sex - ideally in a friends-with-benefits context - via adult contact sites, and online fora more generally. However, i've met with little success in this regard. Insofar as i get any interest, i am eventually turned down for not ""passing"" as a woman (i.e. i don't look sufficnetly 'womanly' or 'feminine' according to sociocultural ideas about what a woman 'should' look like) - primarily, i think, because my facial structure is quite 'masculine', regardless of what the rest of my body looks like. (i've just turned 40, and didn't start the gatekeeping process until my late 20s / early 30s, so the hormones have been trying to work on a relatively fixed body.) 

i'm really not interested in trying to meet people's demands/expectations of 'femininity' via wearing certain outfits, makeup etc. - i'm a nudist, and don't like wearing clothes or makeup at the best of times, so such presentations would not be *me*. (Indeed, doing so would feel to me like dishonest fakery.) i'm looking for people attracted to *me as i am*, not to a façade that has to be maintained at all times, even during the throes of pleasure!

I've been feeling so much like a girl in recent days and having been getting quite a bit of dysphoria. I came out to my family just over a month ago and since I've been feeling like a boy/neutral so that's alright. But now I'm feeling like a girl I feel really depressed as there's no a damned thing I can do about it. I can't express my gender at all and it's really upsetting and annoying

The reason I can't is my mum. Ever since I told her I'm trans* she's been asking how I'm *'feeling'* everyday and even if I do the slightest thing girly she asks if I'm alright. For example the other day when getting out the car I swung both my legs out the door together rather then one at a time keeping them together as it's more girly (this wasn't intentional and I was still in boy mode at that time). My mum noticed this and asked I'd I'm feeling okay or if I'm feeling like a girl and if I've ""had any of those thoughts"" [of being a girl]. See, it's so damn annoying, she make out it's a bad thing I'm gender fluid and so I'm kinda scared to tell her I'm having these ""feelings"" in case she gets mad or onslaughts a ton of awkward questions.  I can tell she thinks me being trans* is odd from the way she shys away from the word transgender and just refers to it as ""it"" or ""those feelings""

But now I'm starting to feel like a girl again and I'm getting lots of dysphoria as I can't do anything to express my gender. There's not a great deal I can do because I still in school however at home I want to wear girls clothes like skinny jeans, shirts and panties, be called Danny not just Dan and be referred to as ""they"" yet I can't as I'm scared my mum will react badly if I tell her I feel like a girl and I want to dress like one, not entirely, I don't want a dress or anything just little things. And the body hair, I hate that, it make me nearly vomit as t just disgusting, how can I remove that without my mum creaking out? **(TL;DR?)** So what I guess I'm asking is, I'm feeling like a girl and I'm scared to tell my mum because  she might freak out.

So on the weekend, my youngest sibling came out to me as Genderqueer. Aside from our mother, I am the only family member they have told this far - our other siblings etc are unaware. 

I would like to know - how can I best support them? 

I obviously love my sibling and it wouldn't matter to me if they identified as a 60ft purple alien from Mars - I love them unconditionally and this doesn't change how much I love and care about them. 

However, I am sure there are things I should take into consideration that I am unaware of (being unfamiliar with the Genderqueer community). 

I have already changed the pronouns I use (after asking which pronoun they prefer). 

What other things could or should I do to help my sibling moving forward and to show my unconditional support?

Identity labels

I go by gender fluid or gender non-conforming (in general) would this be an 
accurate use of the terms or is there one more fitting for me? 

Body image;

Laser hair removal for beards, will I have a shadow forever or in time with 
proper laser will it be gone? Also should I skip laser on my body until I make 
up my mind about hormones?  
Balding head... Just shave it? Play of the Sinéad O'Conner? 

HRT;

Is there a form or way to use Hrt to rid the body of hair and make slight 
feminising changes with out changing/affecting my genitals or overly developing 
breast, I think mentally I can handle some breast growth and nipple change but 
full breast seem too far for who I am now. 

I hope these aren't ridiculous question and I have been doing my own research on 
the topics but I can really use some outside input. I'm 35 and I feel the clock 
ticking and I don't want to lose anymore of my life to fear.   Anything from 
links to similar stories would be great. Thanks everyone.

I was teased as a kid because I had, quite literally, no sense of fashion and would just wear whatever I found that was clean. Due to the teasing, I developed a strong insecurity regarding fashion and buying clothes for myself. I always fear that my friends and family will make fun of what I wear because it doesn't match. It has come to the point where the mall causes a very strong sense of anxiety, especially when friends want me to look at clothes and give my opinion. For age reference, I just graduated high school. 

When I was seven I decided I was ""Sam"" for a day and dressed up in what few boy's clothing I had. Since then, I have had fits and bouts of not feeling comfortable as a woman, but they have come more and more often these days. Some days I want to dress in complete drag, but I don't have much in the way of men's clothing. My sister and I share a chest binder, and I have dressed as a guy before, but it is never actually convincing. Sometimes I want to look like a man, and other times I want to be a man. Still, there are instances where I don't even consider gender and am just who I am. 

Frankly, my dream is to dress similarly to Stephen from *The Well of Loneliness*, by Radcliffe Hall--elegant and masculine. Formal. The only problem is, suits are damn expensive. Do you guys have any recommendations on what to wear or shop? For the older style formal wear, I was thinking thrift stores and antique shops (some around me sell clothing), but if you guys have any preferences, I'd be glad to hear them.

I'm still very knew to accepting that I like to look like a man more often these days. This seems like a really open and nice community, and I'm glad I've found it. :)

My sister and I share a chest binder, and I have dressed as a guy before, but it is never actually convincing. Sometimes I want to look like a man, and other times I want to be a man. Still, there are instances where I don\'t even consider gender and am just who I am. \n\nFrankly, my dream is to dress similarly to Stephen from *The Well of Loneliness*, by Radcliffe Hall--elegant and masculine. Formal. The only problem is, suits are damn expensive. Do you guys have any recommendations on what to wear or shop? For the older style formal wear, I was thinking thrift stores and antique shops (some around me sell clothing), but if you guys have any preferences, I\'d be glad to hear them.\n\nI\'m still very knew to accepting that I like to look like a man more often these days. This seems like a really open and nice community, and I\'m glad I\'ve found it. :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': ""I'm nervous and new...

Other days i love my breasts. And feeling girly. 

It just sort of feels futile because there is nothing i can do to make sure i am happy with my body. Ok i am being dramatic but im just going to assume you know what i mean.

2014-06-24 10:48:33,28yefy,3,5,"It's hard to really know where to begin...

I'm a 20 year old bisexual, born female. For a long time, throughout my teen years, I had issues with my gender identity. 

As a kid, I was a pretty typical tomboy. When I'd go to school, I'd always end up playing with the boys, usually because the boys were doing the things I wanted to do and the girls weren't, if that makes sense. Girls tended to not really like me and bully me. I had an abusive mother, so all in all I grew to have a distrust for women, something I fortunately grew out of. 

In my childhood and young teens I acted in summer plays, and I would read stories and watch other plays. I always wanted to play the male roles of these stories and plays I would see, because they seemed more dynamic and fun and fitting. I would do imagination games with other kids, and I would typically act out some sort of male role in the story. Of course, early on this wasn't a big deal to anyone, but as I grew older I started to see that others saw this as strange. 

As I grew up, I began to notice that girls and boys seemed to socialize differently within themselves, and with each other. I would watch the boys have friends, and I wanted to be friends with them in the same way, but when I would try, I could tell they didn't see me the same way. I played sports, coed for a few years, and I was frequently frustrated at how physically weaker I was compared to the males on the team. I'd train whenever I could but I could never seem to get near their strength. I was one of the few females on the team, and the coach's way to encourage the team to get better was to insult them-by calling them ""girls"".

Whenever we'd go out to buy clothes, I started requesting male clothes. I told my parents it was more comfortable on me. I told them I had a problem with wearing clothes that were in any way tight, which was the truth, but only part of it. My mom started to really get annoyed that I tended to wear masculine clothes. She kept insinuating I was a dyke, or that I somehow thought I was being cool by not wearing feminine clothing. 

I never really knew transgenderism was a real think for a long time. I just had a strange urge to try and look male. I felt a surge of accomplishment whenever someone mistook me for a boy. When I started college, my own best friend at the time couldn't tell what gender I was for our first few days of knowing each other, and I felt happy feeling that I was finally talking to a guy on an equal level with him, even if it was through an apparent misunderstanding. 

I went through a lot during my first years of college. I got respect for doing what I loved doing. I made friends, male and female, and developed great connections with them. It seemed my agonizing over my gender during my teen years was completely unfounded, and I felt I had an epiphany, that I could be whatever I wanted to be and do whatever I wanted and it didn't matter what genitals I had. Heck, I was even happy being feminine some days, especially if it made my boyfriend happy.

But still...

There was still the odd comment, the guy feigning interest until he found out I wasn't interested in a possible date, enjoying the jokes of my friends when someone would say ""you shouldn't say that around a WOMAN"". And then, more frequently over time, I'd get the urge to once again make myself up masculine. I had learned how to apply makeup in such a way as to make my face masculine, and I would dress in the male clothes I still had, though I had to buy wider pants to accommodate my now wide hips and looser shirts to hide my large breasts. I used to occasionally do this when meeting my boyfriend, under the guise of ""just practicing contouring for cosplay"" and ""a joke"", but whenever I did this he wouldn't want to be couple-y toward me, stating ""I love you, but I feel strange doing this because you look like a guy right now"" (which I understand, he is quite straight). And on the one hand, I'd feel that pride again, but with that pride would come an immediate urge to wipe off the makeup and let down my hair again just so my boyfriend wouldn't be so awkward. 

Essentially, on some days I feel the urge to dress feminine, wear makeup, and accentuate all my feminine beauty. On other days, I feel the urge to look as male as possible, and when I do, I feel strong and respected. Most days I just dress in whatever I grab.

I wouldn't want to ever surgically alter myself. I don't want to make anything permanent. But at the same time, more and more I'm starting to not feel comfortable calling myself female. But nor do I feel fully male. I feel like either way, people automatically make judgments on my capabilities, judgments I do not want. I do feel like I'm somewhere in between, depending on my mood. But I'm not sure if this is a legitimate thing, or if this sounds like something straight out of the depths of Tumblr. 

I just feel like I'm limited if I allow myself to stay a specific gender. I wish I was like those aliens in The Left Hand of Darkness. Either genderless until I want to be with my boyfriend, or taking a pill to stay a certain gender for periods of time and switching on a whim. I've been trying to train myself to have a larger vocal scale with a deeper voice. I've even been considering buying a banding device. 

I guess my question is, is there anyone who can relate? What should I do? Is there more to this? Is this something I should concern others with?

I asked a few days ago how I could go about telling my mum I've been having a lot of dysphoria recently and she asked me today how I was feeling so I took that opportunity. It didn't go well tbh as she was asking many awkward questions and I was really embarrassed so just replied ""I don't know"" for example she must have asked me 7 times if I'm attracted to boys or if I'm only attracted tot eh, when I'm feeling girly. Also she suggested it was mainly exam stress causing me to be dysphoric and I said it wasn't but she insisted on asking a further three times and then as a result of her making her own conclusion on this she suggested that I don't really need to see my GP and a therapist because I have been managing on my own.

I haven't been managing, I haven't told her this though as she'll go mad. As you can see she freaks out enough when I've had even the slightest bit of dysphoria. But mange I don't need to see a therapist as I think they were only going to confirm what I already know and I've though of ways to manage the dysphoria on my own. But telling my mum is going to be difficult. I have two girly bracelets I sometimes wear and my mum asked if those bracelets make me ""feel better"" and said I can 'just' wear those as I'd these bracelets will magically remove all dysphoria. How can I tell her this isn't the case? I want to be called Danny and ""they"". I want some girly clothing like panties, shirts, skinny jeans, and accessories plus I also want some (if not most) of my body hair removed (temporarily or permanently). Finally I want to grow my hair more. But how can I tell this!? She WILL freak the fuck out! I've so far given her only a fraction of the picture, how can I give her the rest?

I'm sure that I'm gender fluid as I sometimes feel I'm a boy and others a girl and sometimes or both and hopefully expressing my gender more can confirm this. But I need to tell my mum first. Do I really need to see a therapist? I think I can ""manage"" the dysphoria and I just wanted the therapist to confirm what I was thinking and the thing I've already thought of to manage the dysphoria. But I need to tell my mum this - how the hell do I tell her? It'll be really awkward and these conversation are just tedious and tiring because she keeps asking the same thing and suggesting pointless reasons and solutions.
