So for my whole life (I'm in my early 20's now) up until very recently, I identified happily enough with my birth assigned gender: Male. I have always been significantly more feminine than most other boys and men in my mind-set and I have always been pretty repulsed by highly masculine things. But not enough to cause me to think that I was anything other than just a more feminine man. I don't have any body dysphoria and I don't really think I have any gender dysphoria either. Like I hate the idea of gaining large muscles and a highly masculine body, but neither do I want a female body, and I definitely don't have a female gender identity, even though I identify more with feminine personality traits than masculine.

I read a lot of genderqueer people talking about how they have felt since a young age that their assigned gender identity didn't fit, and then they found out about the genderqueer identities later on. For me it's the opposite, I never doubted I was a man, and never experienced any depression or dysphoria about that identity. But when I found out about the genderqueer and in particular the androgyne gender identity, I suddenly started questioning whether I am actually a man. And when I think about it now I realise that I have no real attachment to the male gender identity. Like I wouldn't miss it or really care if people didn't call me or see me as a 'he'.

The more I think about it the more I feel like my internal identity is irrelevant to the label of man or woman, and is rather just an androgynous mixture of masculine and feminine traits.

I know there's no need for a rush to make any sort of decision. This is all very new and I plan on taking a lot of time experimenting and figuring things out. 

I guess the main thing I'm confused about is lack of dysphoria. I could probably continue my life as a guy and I don't think I would really suffer any depression about it or anything. But when I think about what really fits best, I feel happier and more comfortable with a label of 'neither-gender' or 'androgyne'.

For some background information, My daughter's mother and I recently divorced, and it was a messy divorce. My daughter is 15 years old and just started a new school this year and started dating a new boy for the past month or so. Right before she and this boy made it FBO that they were dating, my daughter came out as pansexual. I honestly am supportive of her and couldn't be happier that she feels comfortable being herself. I suspected for a while that she was lesbian or bi-sexual (I had never heard of pansexual before, but I can see how it fits. She has always been very inclusive, so it makes sense)So yay, my daughter is pansexual, end of story, right? Wrong.

Now she is coming out on Facebook as all these different things. Poly amorous, Demi-sexual, Genderfluid, etc. And these are not things she is discussing with me, she simply changes her Facebook to say she is these things. I am absolutely lost as to why she feels she needs to constantly define and redefine herself. She never displayed any interest in identifying as genderfluid before dating this boy (who is also pansexual) She loves doing her hair and make up and wearing dresses. Now all of a sudden she is commenting on Binding sites and changing her Facebook account info to saying she wants to be referred to as ""They."" As I said before, I fully support her being herself, but part of me worries she is coming out as all these different identities because of this new boyfriend. 

I am worried that anything I say to her will go right back to her mother (who hates me and twists everything I say.) I want to be supportive, but I also don't want her changing herself for a 15 year old boy. How do I talk to her about this?

I'm in my 20's, currently working at a dead end job and planning on going to college soon(ish). I just recently got married to the most beautiful girl on this earth and couldn't be happier. Except for one thing...

To save you all the long winded details, over the course of my life and finally to where I am at in the present I'm pretty sure I have always been genderqueer. I haven't really came to a solid conclusion until now. It's been a confusing journey for sure. 

""Am I just over thinking things?"", ""Does everyone else feel this way?"", ""What if I'm trans but in denial?"" , ""What about all those *'special snowflake'* type people out there trying too hard to find a perfectly unique niche to fit into? Am I one of those people?"", ""What is it to feel like a woman? Like a man?""

These are the questions I ask myself and I do not have all the answers. 

I know I don't feel at home being 'female' but imagining myself as fully 'male' is just as unappealing. I certainly wouldn't mind being called 'sir' on accident just the same I don't flinch when someone calls me 'ma'am'. I do think I've always had some sort of dysphoria, mainly about my chest but I'd always put it back in my mind that I was self-conscious about my weight or any other number of excuses.

Part of me is just rejecting that being genderqueer can be an actual identity. It should be A or B and no where else is acceptable. And I guess that's where all the anxiety and confusion is coming from. I don't FEEL like A or B. I wish I'd have more B attributes rather than A but I don't feel comfortable **being** either. 

Ugh, I dunno. I don't expect anyone here to have all the answers, but at least from what I've read so far I'm certainly not alone in this. And that in and of itself is comforting.

First a quick intro as I am new around here... 35 year old male who is a bit overweight, has a sizable belly, and moderately hairy.  Going bald so it's just trimmed down, but love the full beard.  Think: Lumberjack that got lazy, heh.

I have as long as I have memories for been into feminine things.  Did the sister's panties thing when I was very young and ""got caught"".  Immediately was sent to a therapist, who was amazing in that we talked about anything and everything BUT the very topic that had driven me to her sessions.  So right off the bat I learned cross dressing was BAD.  Well that sure as shit stuck. 

30 some odd years, 2 suicide attempts, and a nearly crippling social anxiety disorder later I have had enough.  Been seeing the most amazing therapist for the last few months and she has already helped me break down the self-esteem and self-worth issues that have haunted me for decades.  By no means are we done, but any progress is good progress!

So here I an in a better mental place and examining what I know:  I know that I am a guy, I know that I identify with that sex.  I love my (very supported fiance), I love Hockey and getting into the aggression during the games, but my favorite color is pink and love all thinks cute... especially Hello Kitty stuff.  I've been a closet cross dresser pretty much my entire life.  Internet shopping was like my world opened up in front of me.  I have never thought I wanted to be a female beyond some laments along ""I wish I had that body type to rock that hot ass dress"".  

I think I may be digressing... back to the topic header.  I have been looking for ways to slowly integrate 'girly' things that make me happy into day-to-day life.  My job is very lax but it is still a professional career I wish to advance in so trying to keep it subtle.

I picked up a new pink/black [case for my phone](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KRG890K/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1). I thought I would get a ton of flak for it at work.  It made me happy to no end that not one comment was made.  Minor win for my confidence!

I'd like to continue this trend and picked up myself a [new watch](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H3FTH9K/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1): 

It is super adorable and I love it.  I am a bit afraid to wear it to work now though - is it too much to soon?  If I wear it, it's now a pink phone and hello kitty watch.  I feel it's too much, too fast and agggagagahh that self-doubt comes washing back in.  *I* find it adorable and it makes me smile every time I check the time.  Isn't that enough?  Why does it matter that that someone else may make a comment.   Ggggrrrr... 

I dearly wish I could find this fluid gender expression feeling - be a guy but express myself however I feel whenever that feeling strikes.  Next goal is to be comfortable enough in my own skin to wear girl jeans outside of the house.  They fit fine, and the fiance LOVES them on me, but the idea is so anxious inducing it cripples my decisions =/

Anyway... there was a question in that rant:

Is it too much too soon to just start incorporating external things day-to-day when it is wholly unexpected or known to colleagues.   Just carry on and just surround myself with what make ME happy?

A little about myself: AFAB, identify as agender/genderfluid, but I do like to present myself as male (although with varying degrees of success). My parents are cool with me buying men's clothing and all (heck, my parents share outerwear with each other), but the binding issue is another story. I'm overweight, and most of the fat in my body is on my thighs (think Chun Li thighs from Street Fighter) and breasts. I've been loosing weight lately, and luckily for me the first place where I've lost some chub is on my breasts, but they do still bother me. I currently wear a 38B, but the B cups are a bit too big, although A cups are a little too small. (Yeah, bra shopping is hell for every reason possible.) My mother is all for getting me sports bras, but I've had varying success with them. Sometimes they compress my breasts a little, and other times there's not real change in appearance. 

So should I just wait and see what I look like after losing weight, or should I get myself a binder now? I know my own breast size isn't that big, but they seem ginormous as times to me.

He also says that I would care if it was my partner, which I really wouldn't unless they looked like a hobo when we went to a fancy restaurant. For the record, I always look good and do put an effort to look good, just not in a ""girl"" way because I'm not a ""girl"" most days.

He is very assumptive on everyone's part, and always has to know more than everyone else, even when he clearly knows nothing.

I have some thought that if I don't try, I can't be disappointed: i.e. if people don't know, I can't be disappointed in them for assuming ""she/her/herself,"" but if they know, and it's still just too hard for them to compute ""boobs + high voice + non-aggressive = he,"" then well, I'd be sad about it.

I'm very new here, both to reddit and being non-binary (is it one word, hyphenated, or two words).

After trying on so many pairs of jeans, I just saw myself in the mirror and felt sick.  Even though it doesn't make sense, because women wear jeans as well, I just felt like I looked even more like a man than normal.  It's the iconic ""manly man"" look: jeans and a t-shirt.

I'll talk to her again this afternoon, and I might call my dad tonight and just tell him, because then he has plenty of time before xmas to get over any problematic feelings he may have, and there won't be this huge gender-shaped cloud hanging over me at xmas when my mom and brother know but not my dad.

I told her that I\'d prefer she not refer to me with gendered terms like ""woman"" or ""girl"" but that ""daughter"" is ok, since there\'s no gender-neutral term for adult children. She also didn\'t realized that I\'d already taken steps. I explained that I\'d already essentially transitioned socially - that everyone (besides work) knows and that I\'ve been working on having a more masculine presentation. I sent her a couple of selfies of me in boymode, to which she replied ""interesting"". I told her that it\'s not a matter of what I *want*, per say, but what will make me feel less shitty about living in my body. I think she gets it more now, because to be fair the last time she saw me I femme\'d it up for Thanksgiving, so she didn\'t realize that wasn\'t an accurate representation of how I live my life. I\'ll talk to her again this afternoon, and I might call my dad tonight and just tell him, because then he has plenty of time before xmas to get over any problematic feelings he may have, and there won\'t be this huge gender-shaped cloud hanging over me at xmas when my mom and brother know but not my dad. \n\nThank you all for support, and any additional support/advice that you lovely people can come up with would be amazing....', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'I came out to my mom and... nothing.', 'created': 1418118141.0}"

Anyway, I put up a post because I just wanted to reach out.  I'm kind of a loner and have never really felt like I wanted or needed a community.  The responses from all of you have blown me away.  I never thought it would mean this much.  I've been crying, tears of relief, as I read through your comments.  The words that always get are simply: You are not alone.

If we're being honest, this whole experience, finding our identities and what they mean and who we really are is really scary.  It's a terrifying moment to look in the mirror and realize the person in it isn't the person inside.  It's so easy to feel so very lost.  It's so easy to feel like you're alone.

So on an average day I have to be alert for people trying to be snarky merely because I choose to paint my nails, let alone if I am actually full on expressing myself.

Today, I was at work, checking people out as normal and generally just chugging through my day. Another day at the 'office' as they say. A young lady with a small child comes to my checkout lane and begins to compliment me on my nails, then goes on to relay her tale of woe like so: 

&gt; ""So today my 4 year old nephew was asking me why people were saying it's bad that he has his toes painted"" *aside* *""He throws a fit whenever we paint ours to have his painted""* 
   
""It sounds to me like those people are being bigots"" *&lt;Continues checking her items out&gt;* Normally, this sort of idle chit chatter is normal in checkout and I don't mind engaging them somewhat, I was expecting her to argue that the kid is 4, not bust out an argument I might make.

&gt; ""I know right? I mean come on, it's not right to stick people into boxes or force gender roles on them! I mean he does go to &lt;Blah Blah&gt; Baptist Church, but still!""

I'd relay the whole conversation but I don't remember it all.

General warning for some rather transphobic and homophobic things she's said. She's also kind of verbally violent, but I won't go into much detail.

Fyi: I'm a general enby person who is questioning how trans I am and if I would be okay with living life closer to the masculine part of the spectrum. I'm also asexual panromantic, which makes things a lot more complicated. People generally consider me female because I don't pass well.

Okay, so when I came out to my mother, it was also the first time I decided to dress in a traditionally masculine manner. I was basically hiding my chest and not wearing makeup. All year, my mom has told me that she supports what I do 100%, but she absolutely freaked out when she saw me. She complained that I would never get a boyfriend (not one of my goals) and that girls would think I'm a lesbian (kind of a goal, haha). I wasn't very bothered by this, but it kept happening and she kept asking me if I was ""pretending to be a boy"" every time I did it. 

Ironically, she understands I am androgynous in my clothing choices and says that she likes that as long as androgynous means having short hair and wearing a dress and lipstick. As much as people look beautiful like that, it makes me uncomfortable to look like that and doesn't fit my idea of androgynous. She got angry when I explained that as well. 

Lastly, I've come to her a couple times wondering if I could purchase a binder. I usually pass it off as a theater or costuming thing, but she always says no and that I'll look like a ""butch lesbian who hits on girls."" I think that she's a lot more transphobic and homophobic than she understands and might be having a hard time adjusting to having a bleeding heart liberal radical gay in her house.

tl;dr my mom doesn't like it when i don't wear heavy makeup and flowery dresses and act like her biological daughter and might be having a hard time adjusting to having a possible transman under her roof.

As much as people look beautiful like that, it makes me uncomfortable to look like that and doesn\'t fit my idea of androgynous. She got angry when I explained that as well. \n\nLastly, I\'ve come to her a couple times wondering if I could purchase a binder. I usually pass it off as a theater or costuming thing, but she always says no and that I\'ll look like a ""butch lesbian who hits on girls."" I think that she\'s a lot more transphobic and homophobic than she understands and might be having a hard time adjusting to having a bleeding heart liberal radical gay in her house.\n\ntl;dr my mom doesn\'t like it when i don\'t wear heavy makeup and flowery dresses and act like her biological daughter and might be having a hard time adjusting to having a possible transman under her roof.\n\n/r/genderqueer, what\'s your advice?

2014-12-16 02:09:16,2pfak8,5,4,"ok, background. like i said, i'm amab and i'm solely attracted to men. from a young age, there's been this nagging feeling urging me to try on dresses, try makeup, shave parts of my body other than my face, etc. however, none of this has felt like it was strong enough to warrant me being a transwoman. BUT, i do feel quite restricted by strict masculinity. so this leads me to believe that i'm probably genderqueer.

a few years ago i decided to act on one of these desires and grow my hair out to ~shoulder length. (it's a bit longer than that right now.) i was more comfortable than i had ever been in my own skin before that moment. one time, a bad haircut forced me to cut my hair short again. i was so uncomfortable until it grew out again, beyond normal levels i think. the thought of potentially having to cut my hair for work gives me much emotional pain. i think this is the biggest piece of evidence for me being genderqueer.

on top of that, i've always looked up to and identified with the female figures in my life. as a kid, i always played as the girl characters in video games. and being attracted to men, i quite often have fantasies about being put in a feminine role in my relationships.

i have sort of ""rediscovered"" masculinity recently, in the form of finding fashions that suit me and growing a goatee. (the latter of which i'm currently comfortable with, but definitely would not want to keep if i ever started presenting as female.) but again, this alone still feels restricting and i definitely want to try female fashions and such.

i'm asking for two things there: 1) people's opinions on whether i'm nonbinary or not, and 2) cheap, easily hideable ways to experiment with my gender presentation. makeup, hair, and clothing tips would be especially appreciated.

thank you very much!

I'm AFAB and I know I don't like being put in a box having anything to do with gender, but isn't that normal? Although, I've felt really out of place at most ""women's"" events that I've been to, so maybe it's not that normal.

The one area in which I do feel a lot of solidarity with women is the way my life has been affected by growing up with a body that signals to people that I'm a girl/woman. The way I've been treated because of my body is very much part of my identity.

Speaking of my body, I like it. But I also daydream about having a male body, or somewhere in between. I had short hair for a long time and liked presenting androgynous. I have long hair now and I like my hair but I do sort of miss androgyny. I've also gained some weight and I miss having more of a lean, androgynous body. I don't know if any of that counts as dysphoria.

I dress comfortably. Jeans and a t-shirt most days. Doc Marten boots. Hoodie. No makeup.

I desperately want a tuxedo and as soon as I have one, I will be just as likely to wear that as I will a dress.

My name and she/her pronouns are fine with me. I'm used to them and they don't cause me any dysphoria. I also wouldn't be offended or correct anyone if they referred to me using other pronouns.

So, gender identity: ambivalent? Maybe agender? All I know is that when I think too much about it, my head just starts spinning.

Any suggestions? Should I just stop worrying about it?

2014-12-18 21:00:53,2ppxfj,20,13,"Hi everyone. It was suggested to me that I might be a non-binary female and I'm curious to hear experiences of those who identify this way.

First of all though I may be using incorrect terminology and if so I apologize. I'll describe how I feel and maybe there's a more appropriate descriptor.

So I realize there are many possibilities under the trans umbrella, this is where I fall. I am MAAB, and currently transitioning to female. My goal in transition is to be socially female, I would love to have female pronouns and name, and be seen as female. 

I would like a female body, as this makes me happy. My presentation and style would be feminine and vary from maybe punk to classy to sexually provocative to everywhere in between. Female voice, and female expression. If I am able, I would prefer female parts. I have a growing dislike for what I have but have never hated it, just feel like I'd prefer the female anatomy.

So where things become unclear is my internal gender identity. I honestly at times cannot say what it is. I have a great deal of internalized transphobia and a lifetime of repression.

The confusing aspect of my identity is that I spent my entire life believing I am a guy, and I even wanted to be. I dont know if it's because I wanted to fit my male body. The thing is, I was terrified of being a girl. I knew there was something ""wrong"" with me but I didnt have words for it.

I would never have wished to be a girl or transform, I think I repressed so deep that I would be under the belief that entertaining these thoughts would make me a girl, which I didn't want to be. This was in direct opposition to my very compartmentalized desires to be made a female sexually. So I believe there was probably massive overcompensation.

When I admitted to myself that I desired to become female, it was like a cascade of feeling and freedom.

What I'm left with is what feels like a very muddy and confused gender identity. Why did I want to be male if my gender identity has always been female, etc. This makes it difficult to say that I am a girl.

At times I am very uncertain of my identity. My expression is lacking and I *envy* cis women and trans women for their female expression, and I want badly for that to be me.

When it was suggested to me I may be non-binary, this makes sense to me due to my confused gender identity. I skew heavily female but I cant shake the feeling of male from my gender identity, and I dont like it.

Anyway enough rambling. I would love to hear stories and experiences and feelings of non-binary folks who skew heavily female. Such as why do you identify that way, whats life like, how do you feel about your identity?

**Dressing up as a Female, Fantasy** 

I have reoccurring fantasies of being a woman. I'm playing ""dress up"" in these fantasies, but not dressing up in an over-feminizing sort of way with schoolgirl/nurse/etc outfits to get off as some men do. But I picture myself dressed in genuine female attire.

In these fantasies I try on different outfits, make-up routines, hair styles, etc. I really like the idea of thinking about what kind of girl I'd be. Playing dress-up in general.

Rarely do I fantasize anything sexual. When I do, I happen to have a penis and it's usually solo stimulation with no penetration. In fact, I never imagined myself with a vagina, not even once. I always have breasts in my fantasies. In my sexual fantasies, I do not see men or other women. 

The only exception for sexual partners in my fantasies is of faceless men, who are often seen as strong and calm as I please them, which can be very exciting.

Usually I am somewhere familiar and private.

Help? :) 

I'm 15 and AFAB. 
Do you even consider me old enough to have set opinions on the matter? 
A couple years ago I began looking at different identifying terms and I began to question my sexuality. I was almost certain I wasn't quite ""straight"" though no one *really* is. Eventually I gave up on that, passing is off as a phase and jokingly calling myself a gay guy.

When I was little I was definitely a tom boy. It made me upset to wear pink and to play dress up. For some reason, I enjoyed playing with barbies just the same. But typically they would end up in a lesbian relationship way more often than a straight relationship. I grew up in the midwest, and had not once seen or heard anything about the LGBT world. 

More recently I became truly aware and understanding of the term genderqueer. I asked many people about if they felt like a girl (If they were female) or a guy (if they were male) in their head, not just because of their parts and all things similar. I realized that I don't think of myself as a girl specifically. Nor do I feel like a guy. But I don't think I would care if people called me ""he"" and then call me ""ma'am"" a moment later. I enjoy having boobs, and I wouldn't want them to go away, but I don't believe I would protest if they just poofed out of thin air. 

I tried on guy clothing yesterday and hid my hair. I loved it and suddenly felt *off* looking at the girls clothes afterword for awhile, but I didn't buy the outfit I tried on. Today I put my hair up in a hat and had bangs out to look like a guy, which excited me. But when I darkened my eyebrows and really looked like a guy, it made me uncomfortable and a little sick (though that could have been from overheating..?) 

Even after typing all of this out, I can't clearly imagine myself dressing or acting androgynous or largely towards a ma anywhere past my college years. 

I've never experienced dysphoria and I feel like I just like the idea of being different. 

Again, I know I have years to think about this and I'm young. I also know that I don't **need** to have a label to be myself.

2014-12-24 01:38:19,2q8gip,2,3,"Hi everyone, 

Brand new to this group. I wanted to ask for a little insight about gender neutral names, name changes etc. as well as to invite anyone to share their thoughts on this topic in general, because I feel like it's something that tends to factor into genderqueer experience a lot, at least in my queer communities. 
(Disclaimer: I realize that names being ""gendered"" at all is a construct just like any other gendered thing, and I don't mean to imply that having a ""unisex"" name is more valid than any other for an NB person. I'm really just speaking to my own experience). 
I'm in my early twenties, non-binary (/genderfluid/who knows?) and AFAB. I had a lot of dysphoria about my ""feminine"" birth name. For a while now I've been going by Teagan, which I chose because it felt less gendered to me and research indicated that it's ""gender neutral"", because it's kinda similar to my legal name, and because I liked it. I still like it, but am having some second thoughts about it. I feel like it's perceived as a feminine name b/c people think of Tegan Quin from Tegan &amp; Sara... which also makes me feel kind of weird b/c it's one more way for me to fit into lesbian stereotypes (I like girls and other trans people). I know that it should only matter what I think of my name and not other people but I'm insecure anyway tbh. 
Does anyone have experience with changing their name twice? Choosing a name was a powerful gesture for me but it can also be draining to constantly make people aware of the change, put up with people messing up, etc... I felt vulnerable doing it and would probably be afraid of being judged if I chose a new name again. I also wonder if/how much it would complicate things like employment (like if all the references you used knew you by a different name than your current one). But then maybe it's worth these inconveniences to feel more secure in your identity. 
Right now I really like the name ""Orion"" and am thinking about it a lot (I love space and stars and the idea of a constellation name. :) If you have any space/astronomy related name ideas that don't seem overtly gendered, feel free to share!)
Thoughts on any of the above are much appreciated. Thanks!

i'm XX and have struggled with my body constantly from childhood, and after my IUD failed me and i ended up with an ectopic pregnancy, i have decided that enough is enough. 

the thought of having the capability to get pregnant and have children enrages me so much. i've felt this way for years, but now more than ever i just want to take matters into my own hands and remove my uterus myself if nobody else will do it. 


i want something PERMANENT. i would freeze some eggs in case i want kids down the line and I could use a surrogate, but i think i would feel guilty making my own kids in any case when there are so many who don't have homes. 


i'm so frustrated. i can't take hormonal birth control because it makes me fat and ill, and tubal ligations have about the same success rate as IUD's which apparently isn't enough for my body.


please help. i don't want this capability and i've never really wanted it. i enjoy having curves (to a certain extent, i'd much rather have a man's body but it's not enough to merit a full transition because i don't ID as male) but i just cannot handle the idea that i could become pregnant. it disgusts and horrifies me so much that i can't even find words for it.

I identify as a trans woman. I am 2.5 months into HRT, and working towards a 100% female body, female voice, female expression, GRS, etc. The times when I am happiest are when Im feeling 100% female internally.

My problem is I dont often feel my internal identity as female. Sometimes it just feels blank, or a lack of female. Sometimes i think this means I am male and I end up feeling very distressed.

What can I do to alleviate these feelings, or just accept that i will never be binary female. Or is this something that comes with transition?

2014-12-27 19:33:37,2qjx9h,19,6,"I started posting here in mid September and in that time I've had a noticeable transformation. I've cut my hair short and started styling the top. I've started wearing button up shirts open to the sternum over an a-shirt, and low rise jeans. I've switched from boxers to bikini briefs. I've started exercising more. I'm using a level of care about my appearance that I would be ashamed of in high school, I would have called it vanity. Now though, I love the way I look and plenty of people here and in my life have complimented me on my appearance.

For reasons I can't articulate, r/genderqueer has lead me down this path, and along with the facial hair I've decided to grow(which I also happen to like a lot) I've wound up looking more masculine than I ever have.

Current issues: I love showing off this much of my chest, but I'm afraid of looking douchey, and I know it strains professionalism. I gotta decide when it's proper to button up.

I used to love wearing nerdy t-shirts, now I have a hard time wearing any kind of crew neck tee.

The brand of briefs I wear, Life, don't seem to be available anymore, and it's real hard to find men's bikini cut briefs outside of fetish wear. I'm too nervous to venture into women's underwear just yet, not the least because I've seen how expensive they are.

I would love to do more body mod, but I'm not real secure in my career yet. Plus I don't have any solid ideas of what I want.

2014-12-29 08:54:39,2qp45g,5,5,"Hi, as the title mentions it's my first time posting on here - after sifting through lots of posts tonight/this morning (haven't slept).

 Well, I'm 24, male and first of all I'm somewhat confused about my sexuality. I've only had experiences with girls and am currently in a relationship which I've been in for 9 months. I love my girlfriend but now is where I start becoming completely lost.

 I am more and more thinking that I want to be seen as a woman and a bisexual one at that. I have always been horrendously indecisive. I have done a little bit of cross dressing and 'experimenting' shall we say and it just felt right. All I can think about is that if I could magically turn into a woman I would do it straight away. I keep doubting myself and thinking is this just a phase but I didn't really have a self expressive growing up and still don't know who or what I am and want to be. During puberty lets say I did a couple of things not hetero, but never with anyone else. My current girlfriend is the first relationship I've been in, before that was just casual stuff. The reason I think it might not just be a phase is that i've never been happy with myself and haven't known why.

 I've just got back from a year of travel (where i met my gf) but before i left on my adventures i was having very strong feelings about transitioning, it was ALL I could think about at work - NEVER told a soul about ANY of this. I'm a very introverted person and find it hard to share. Even doing this is a struggle. I just need some advice, anything... I have no idea what to do. I'm so afraid of saying anything to anyone. 

We're planning on going back to travel soon and so if i do go it will definitely get in the way of me finding my true self (ironic eh?). I've pictured trying to talk over any of these issues with my gf and can't help but think I'm just going to alienate her, freak her out or worse. And where the hell do I go from here?

2014-12-30 16:35:35,2qtquo,0,1,"I'm already out to my closest friends. I came out over text, which is probably really cheesy, but they're super accepting and are already getting used to using my preferred name. 

But I really want to come out to my parents as well in the next couple weeks for a few reasons:

* I want to look into top surgery and possibly starting hormones

* I need to start seeing a gender identity therapist 

* I would like them to start using my preferred name and pronouns

The good news: they're both liberal so even though I'm financially dependent on them, I'm completely safe and won't be kicked out or anything and they'd be nothing but supportive. Trans things have come up a couple times. My mom said that people should just stay the gender they were born with but I don't think she would be unaccepting if I explained things to her and she certainly wouldn't be the type to get super upset with me over something like this. My dad thinks it's awesome that people are freer to experiment with gender more than ever before and thinks my friend's desire to be a drag queen and my sister cross dressing for anime cons are awesome so I know he would be completely fine with it. 

The bad news: I am super awkward when it comes to this type of thing. Like really super awkward. I honestly do not think that I could come out face to face because I'm too awkward about it. I don't like talking about my own sexuality/gender/body with my parents.  It would be easier to explain if I was just trans, but nonbinary is gonna take A LOT of explanation especially when they don't know any of the terms or understand much about stuff like dysphoria, top surgery, hormones, etc. Even if I come out with they probably are going to ask about it in person so that will be extremely awkward. So I'll have to bite the bullet and talk to them either way I guess.

Secondly, I'm not entirely sure of my identity. I am 90% sure I'm genderqueer but there are times when I have pretty much no dysphoria and experience extreme self-doubt, and I think I had dysphoria before I leavens about what it meant but I'm worried I might be wrong about that. I'm worried about those times and if I'm not actually genderqueer and am actually just a masculine girl. I'm worried I won't be able to dress on the feminine side when I want to because I don't want people to doubt my gender. I'm worried that I'm wrong and I'll have to sheepishly take back my coming out and that they/my friends will think I was just trying to be special or jumping the gun with my coming out. 

So my questions, I guess:

* What's the best way to come out if I'm too awkward to tell my parents face to face? I was thinking an email with resources and links about this stuff. 

* When they ask about it and I talk to them, how do I try to avoid awkwardness? Any tips?

* Any advice on how to go about explaining being non binary to people who don't understand it?

* What do I do about the doubts I have about being genderqueer? Do I tell my parents or save it for a gender identity therapist? 

If anyone has any coming out stories, that would be helpful too. 

TLDR: I'm too awkward to come out to my parents and explain nonbinary identities, but I need to figure out a way to do it anyway.

first time poster here. I didn't realize there was a genderqueer subreddit until I came across it randomly. it couldn't have come at a better time.

I'm agender. I've been this way for quite some time and I can even trace the beginning of my thoughts about it back to when I was a teenager. it's something that is very important to me... I'm pretty conventionally masculine but not really out of choice.

this past weekend while I was visiting my family for the holidays and ended up getting in a fight with my sister. she's a feminist and a very progressive person about a lot of things. we were talking about LGBTQ issues and I mentioned how much I like the term ""queer"" since it's so encompassing and I feel very comfortable calling myself queer.

she kinda scoffed at me and said that there's no way I could consider myself queer. I told her about being agender a few months ago and she said she accepted it and loved me. but this night she was saying that I couldn't be queer or agender because I pass for a man. am I being too entitled to believe that my identity is my own and that's not for her to decide? I blew up at her and it hurt me so deeply. I couldn't fall asleep til 5AM that night because I was so sad.

I don't want to pass for a man. I don't. I'm finally getting to do a lot of things with my appearance that I've wanted to do for a long time (piercing my ears, experimenting with lipstick, women's clothes). I don't have preferred pronouns, at least yet. so, most people just use he/him with me. am I just exploiting my privilege in not asking people to use different terms? I really have been looking hard for a term that fits best with me... I just figured that it would be better that I don't rush it and find one that I truly identify with instead of picking something just because.

I guess my questions are all related to what is reasonable for me to want? I really hate being called a guy or when people say ""biologically a man"" or ""biologically male"" when they talk about me, but maybe it's just me being unreasonable. I really don't want to be a burden or be entitled.

and since my sister said those things, I keep feeling like I'm not queer enough. and that's conflating issues with me because I recently got out of a longtime relationship with someone I love very deeply: we loved each other very much but it was a bad relationship; I really hated myself and was a shitty partner and did a lot of things wrong and didn't talk about my feelings a lot. anyways, after she ended it with me and about two weeks after it happened, she started hooking up with one of her friends from work. 

now she's come to the realization that she's probably gay. she knew that I identified as agender when we were together but I kind of didn't tell the whole story (I hated when she called me boyfriend, I came out to her by saying I was male but not a man to make it easier to understand, I didn't say anything when she called me a guy...etc.) now I feel even more like people think that all of my identity is just a response to finding that out... I was reading Autostraddle today (something I would normally do) and I immediately felt self-conscious. like I wasn't actually queer and shouldn't read it or care about gay culture. when I fought with my sister, she even said that I specifically was doing all of this agender stuff as a response to my ex being gay.
