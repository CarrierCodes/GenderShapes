That part never gave me pause, although now I am considering more and more whether I actually mean pansexual. But my gender identity doesn't sit as comfortably for me. It used to, but now it doesn't. 

I have been reluctant to say that my gender identity has ""changed"", because I don't want to undermine the idea that people are born with their gender and can't help who they are. I don't want to be insulting to the community by looking like I'm just trying it on for size or something. I really don't know how this works, and I'm terrified as coming off as offensive, but I'm finding it difficult to define my identity to myself. 

Years ago, when I was a teenager and a new adult, I remember feeling like ""female"" perfectly encapsulated me. I had no questions about being female, and I remember being very happy. But when I look back on that person now, it feels like a totally different human being. That woman enjoyed things that  I don't enjoy. She revelled in femininity in a way that feels totally uncomfortable to me now. I noticed things starting to change soon after I started college, and now I feel totally lost. 

I don't feel comfortable with a feminine identity anymore. I also wouldn't feel comfortable with a masculine one. I can't tell if I alternate between the two, or if they both exist within me simultaneously, or if I don't feel like I have a gender at all. When I get attention for my femininity, I feel like I've been misgendered. I used to be flattered by compliments to my female features, now I feel embarrassed. I feel confused when I am called ""pretty."" I haven't worn make-up in six years and I feel like I never want to again. But I also am quite attached to my female genitalia, personally, and have no desire to transition. 

I also don't feel like I could visually pass for male or androgynous, which always makes me feel like those identities were ""not meant for me"", which makes me sad and frustrated. I have exaggerated hips that appear very womanly, and I can't hide them. I hate them. I feel like my own figure misgenders me. I like having a vagina, and I sort of like having breasts, to an extent. But I hate my ""child-bearing"" figure. It belongs on another woman, not me. 

As I recently commented on another post, it's difficult for me to feel comfortable and confident in a genderfluid identity when I have strangers serenading me with Sir Mixalot. And like I said, I feel weird that my identity has changed so much, and I no longer feel like the human I was six years ago. And every time I think about asking for help, I fear insulting someone with my ignorance and confusion.

2014-03-02 08:15:57,1zc073,4,15,"Okay, I'm 24 and was born with male genitalia (to use the most accurate way of describing my physical body) and, over the last few years, have really had doubts on whether I should force myself to live as a man or seek options about transitioning into living as a woman or what.

Let me backtrack a little here. I remember a time, ~3rd/4th grade that I had to wear my sister's underwear for the day. Now, until then, I hadn't honestly paid much attention to what my sister wore, excepting a moment that I remember where I picked up her stockings one Sunday and thought ""How can I get these on, oh crap, not enough time!"", but, about a year after the underwear incident, I found myself starting to be very curious about her clothing. It started with what I, um, had the most intimate experience with. I remember going through her drawer and picking some of her underwear out and trying them on. I didn't really get caught (she saw me in them, but that was because I put them on and left the bathroom door open as I sat to pee...remember this later, as it'll come back) or get into trouble, and, at the time, it was a mostly isolated incident.

Later on, as I got into middle school, I started experimenting with her dirty clothes (we all tossed our clothes into one hamper in the bathroom, it was easier for my mom that way) and thinking that it was a lot of fun. One moment I could have a skirt on, the next, jeans or a dress. I also thought the underwear she had was a lot of fun too, much more than my boring white briefs (speaking of them, I remember when I was ~5th grade that my mom bought me and my sister matching pairs of ""silky stretchy"" panties. I didn't know they were panties at the time, I just knew they didn't have that weird flap of fabric and mine were red and my sister's yellow and she later got mine). I also remember using things like rags to stuff the bras because I didn't think it looked right for me to not have boobs and that the girls my age do.

I would eventually be caught by my mom and would manage to put it on hold for a while, but high school brought a lot of these feelings back, harder. It didn't help that I was a lot smaller than most of the guys (seriously, I have a picture taken my senior year that looks like I'm a freshman). I also remember really liking the underwear that was in the women's section of places like Walmart and Kmart better than the ones I had to wear.

Remember how I said that time I was trying my sister's underwear on that I sat to pee? I went through a phase (possibly impressed on me by my mom, the TL:DR version of it is that, for a few years, until I was ~13/14, or maybe when my sister started, I'm not sure what made it stop, but my mom made me and my sister BOTH accompany her to the restroom at Six Flags and use it at the same time she did. I have some time clocked in women's restrooms) where I sat to pee all the time. If I stood to pee, I didn't touch my penis at all, I still don't really like holding it too pee.

Now, fast forward to recently. I, as you can tell, have a feminine name I've adopted for some social media and internet purposes. I've had thoughts of wanting to live fulltime as either a m2f crossdresser or transsexual, but permanently changing my body and being a woman fulltime doesn't appeal to me. There are times I like being a guy, but there are times I wish I could shave my legs, put on a bikini, nice pair of shorts, and head to the lake or put on a skirt with a nice top and head to the mall or something like that. I also wouldn't mind if, during those types of outings, or even ""guy mode"" outings having some lipstick or other makeup on. If I had a ""fully passable"" femme mode, I'd probably even be inclined to jump the boundaries a little and try on clothes at places like Victoria's Secret or use the women's restrooms. That being said, I don't think the area I live in is very open to the idea of a genderqueer presentation (male head and dress or skirt, for example). I also have days that I feel a little more like a Tiffany and days that I feel more like [Insert My Birth Name Here].

2014-03-05 02:10:38,1zl6tn,3,6,"I've thought quite a lot about the ""cute"" noun-based pronouns that have recently been getting popular among places like tumblr. While I do want people to have a comfortable way of expressing themselves, I realized when thinking about the linguistic implications of it all that that's not actually what pronouns are for and in fact, noun-based ""pronouns"" not only serve no purpose, but impede communication to everyone, particularly those (like me) with difficulties with reading or speaking clearly.
Pronouns exist so that they can be used in place of a noun, in a larger, more general way. They're supposed to apply to a large group and, in the case of human beings and gendered pronouns, represent large groups of people. 
The biggest thing I feel when I see lists of ""pronouns"" like cat/cats/catself or fae/faes/faeself or other things that say more about personality than gender identity, is I don't feel represented as a nonbinary person. And I certainly don't feel comfortable as a dyslexic person with mild learning disability problems having to apply a different set to everyone, including ones that cannot be pronounced or read clearly in context with what's being written.
In wondering what an alternative to this would be, I realized that the problem was at that point. We are not being represented by the English language. Neutral, singular ""they"" is really great and all, but I think that we can agree that it doesn't really do the whole job all the time. There are confusing contextual hurdles to jump, and it's not a pronoun dedicated specifically to people like the binary gendered ones are. I would propose that instead of putting on hundreds of irrelevant word sets and throwing them out to the masses, where they'll be decentralized and have no impact at all, we as a community should try and figure out a standardized set of pronouns that is pronounceable, readable, and not used for anything else to refer to nonbinary people. These would be what can be used for legal documents, certificates, and other official, impersonal forms of communication. This is an angle often ignored by the same kids who keep pushing boat or animal or fairy-themed ""pronoun"" noun-derived word sets around. 
All that said, I kind of want to say (if only to save my ass because I don't want to come off as hostile because I'm really not) that I don't care what somebody's gender is.

While I do want people to have a comfortable way of expressing themselves, I realized when thinking about the linguistic implications of it all that that\'s not actually what pronouns are for and in fact, noun-based ""pronouns"" not only serve no purpose, but impede communication to everyone, particularly those (like me) with difficulties with reading or speaking clearly.\nPronouns exist so that they can be used in place of a noun, in a larger, more general way. They\'re supposed to apply to a large group and, in the case of human beings and gendered pronouns, represent large groups of people. \nThe biggest thing I feel when I see lists of ""pronouns"" like cat/cats/catself or fae/faes/faeself or other things that say more about personality than gender identity, is I don\'t feel represented as a nonbinary person. And I certainly don\'t feel comfortable as a dyslexic person with mild learning disability problems having to apply a different set to everyone, including ones that cannot be pronounced or read clearly in context with what\'s being written.\nIn wondering what an alternative to this would be, I realized that the problem was at that point. We are not being represented by the English language. Neutral, singular ""they"" is really great and all, but I think that we can agree that it doesn\'t really do the whole job all the time. There are confusing contextual hurdles to jump, and it\'s not a pronoun dedicated specifically to people like the binary gendered ones are. I would propose that instead of putting on hundreds of irrelevant word sets and throwing them out to the masses, where they\'ll be decentralized and have no impact at all, we as a community should try and figure out a standardized set of pronouns that is pronounceable, readable, and not used for anything else to refer to nonbinary people. These would be what can be used for legal documents, certificates, and other official, impersonal forms of communication. This is an angle often ignored by the same kids who keep pushing boat or animal or fairy-themed ""pronoun"" noun-derived word sets around. \nAll that said, I kind of want to say (if only to save my ass because I don\'t want to come off as hostile because I\'m really not) that I don\'t care what somebody\'s gender is.

Ok, so recently I got a job at the local Subway after being forced to move back down to crappy 'ole Hillbilly Hell Texas. Upon being hired, I informed my store manager of my genderqueer-ness and she was accepting and very supportive, being a lesbian herself, with a partner. I asked about dress code, and it was pretty boilerplate. I even broached the topic of nail polish and makeup which she had absolutely no problems with. Said it wouldn't be a problem. Not two weeks later I find myself being dismissed for the same reasons due to customer complaints. Now this manager did do her very best to fight this, but her (stupid) bosses eventually triumphed, even if only by sheer technicality. Now my makeup choices are often loud, but I don't believe they're excessive, the most makeup I wear is nail polish, eyeliner, lipstick and eyeshadow. Nothing else matters, I don't need that much. I just enjoy colors on my face. Since my childhood, makeup has always been something I've used to help combat that nagging dysphoria that I've always had that told me that I should be female (MAAB here). Wearing makeup has always been something that has been able to bring me to feeling more like who I am. 

What bothers me the most is that there are people who are so petty that they feel the need to complain about someone like me wearing makeup. I've never even pretended to harm anyone or even be remotely threatening or rude, much less be anything less than accommodating and kind. So yeah, it really grinds my gears. &gt;_&gt;


Anyways feel free to take a look, I always take pictures of makeup that strikes my fancy, so I can share them. Feel free to comment constructively on them. Many of these are from the past year or so. :3

2014-03-05 17:22:09,1zn1n5,13,8,"Hi all, I come here because, well, there has been something bothering me for awhile. Mainly, my identity. 

So, you could say I am FAAB. So far throughout my life, I have identified as female and was seen as such. Growing up, I was always very tomboyish, and had many gender neutral and boyish toys. I wasn't against girly things, but anything beyond Pound Puppies or Furby was way too girly for me. 

Now someone can identify as female and like boy things and be completely content with that and vice versa. However, the more I think about it, I don't have any reason to identify as female. Or male for that fact. 

The only reason I have identified as female was because a doctor took one look at my baby junk and went, ""Eeyup, that one's a girl, alright!""

So other than that, I have no reason or obligation to adhere to this identity. As far as pronouns go, I have found that I'm just naturally not bothered by being called any of them. I mean, most people see me and call me female, but I have been called a sir when I didn't appear overtly feminine. And...it never really bugged me at all. Some assholes in high school would use male pronouns to somehow insult me, but I rather than thinking, ""How date you!"" At being misgendered like this, I instead thought, ""Woah, I can pass as a dude? Cool!""

I guess what I have really wanted for a long time was to pass more as androgynous. Where I could lean either way, really. I want things like short hair (once it's long enough for Locks of Love, it's gone), and some gender neutral looking glasses. I've already done a lot to my wardrobe, which can vary from skinny jeans to baggy pants, and various ""boy"" shirts with Nintendo junk on it. 

My only question then is: what the heck should/do I identify as? I mean as far as pronouns go, I'm alright with all of 'em, so am I androgynous? Agender? Neither? I come here to ask this hoping you folks could lend a hand and help me find the right identity for me because all of these can easily confuzzle the mind.

http://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/1zl6tn/pronouns/


The difficulties associated with a single set are as follows: 

1: it has to be a truly neutral set, not based in male-as-default

2: it has to be easy to say and read, with few confusions possible for other words

3: it has to be usable as a pronoun, grammatically and in an auditory way as well


Pronouns that have been commonly used that use letters like ""z"" and ""x"" are difficult for me, and I don't understand using ""y"" when ""i"" can suffice in the middle of a word. In keeping with typical English spelling and writing patterns, I suggest the following:

Ne (Subjective, like he or she or they)

Nem (Objective, like him or her or them)

Neir (Possessive determiner, such as ""this is their shoe"")

Ners (Possessive pronoun, like hers or theirs or his) 

Nemself (Reflexive, like himself or herself or themselves)

This opens up singular they as a pronoun to be used when a person's gender is unknown. And since it is relatively easy to use in my own experience, (I plugged it into a few books and read the passages aloud; they flow quite well) I propose that we use these as a standard set of nonbinary pronouns. 

Pronunciations are as follows:

Ne like He

Nem like Them

Neir like Their

Ners like Hers

Nemself like Themself (sic) 


What do you think of it? Do you have problems pronouncing or reading these? Have you got a better set that you'd like used instead? Feel free to help me out here! I want to see a standard set that people can agree on that is usable for everybody who speaks English.

I regularly make comments about how ""I'd make a terrible woman"" or ""I'm not even kinda a lady"" somewhat jokingly, and people have commented on the particularly masculine aspects of my personality, but everyone (with one notable exception) still IDs me as female, unless I directly spell it out for them multiple times, which just makes me feel uncomfortable (the first time) and invalidated (every time after).

2014-03-11 09:00:51,204j4b,3,4,"Hello all. 

Essentially, I am trying to figure myself out, and wanting to do more research but having a hard time because it seems that many of the sources I find try to place individuals into categories like gender-fluid, bi-gender, and so forth. And while I hate the idea of labeling myself other than the necessity of trying to explain to others who have no really understanding of gender beyond “male” and “female” (family members, friends, and so forth), it seems like maybe I need a starting point. 


When I was little (under age 10), I used to have interests that crossed gender boundaries. For example, I loved playing with my Transformers, playing soldier or cowboys, and so forth – in other words “boy” interests. I would also raid my sister's Barbie collection and play house. This of course led to all kinds of issues for my father who would do things like calling me a “sissy” in front of my friends, as well as some physical abuse. My mom would try and step in, but she was dealing with her own spousal abuse (and yes, she eventually said enough is enough and moved us away from him). So, I really did not have anyone I could talk to about this. 


When puberty hit, things got weird for me. Like many boys, I found the magical world of dirty magazines. Many times I would look at the pictures or read the “letters” and would identify with the man (“wow, I wish I was having sex with her!”). And other times I would identify with the woman (“Wow, I wish I was her!”). Sex dreams, fantasies, whatever – it would switch back and forth, but not regularly. Being unable to really talk to anyone, I just started making assumptions – I knew I wasn't homosexual since I really liked girls, so I thought I was bi. Well, skip ahead a few years (like, oh, 20 years), and I  realized that men do not really do anything for me either other than within the context of identifying with the woman in hetero situations. However, I did not realize that at the time, and this caused a lot of emotional distress since I was living in a conservative home, and then married (and eventually divorced) a very conservative woman. 


 It was my second wife (my best friend, companion, and partner) who really started noticing the other changes which seem to occur randomly, but for long periods of time (a month or so). My voice, which is already fairly high pitched compared to most men, gets higher. My walk and hand gestures change. My interests do not change, but rather I seem to emphasize minor interests more, and what are usually main interests take a back seat. I tend to get more emotional in my reactions, while more passive sexually. Please keep in mind that, until it was pointed out to me, I honestly did not realize that these changes were occurring.  I have always had moments when I will walk by a mirror or window and see my reflection and have moments of confusion because it is like “Wow...that's not me.” The moments do not last very long, sorta like waking up from a dream and taking a minute to have to get your bearings. 


So....any hints or suggestions for a good starting point. Or, more precisely, an area I should maybe start focusing on as I wade through all the information that is now available?

Nothing happened to me on my way to the restoom but when I came out an employee (who I later found out is the manager) started lecturing and interrogating me loudly about how wrong I was to use ""the wrong restroom"", asked me why I did it, and warned me ""never to do do that again"".

2014-03-13 19:22:18,20c9ji,11,4,"I've always been confused between the two, and what they mean exactly. 

By literal definition, agender would mean the lack of ""gender"" in its conventional form. Bigender would then mean the melding of the two ""standard"" genders. 

What confuses me is the internal process that goes on with each of them. I am AMAB Genderqueer, and I feel like either of those could apply to me.

2014-03-13 22:04:47,20cqax,22,34,"I'm Italian, more specifically I'm from Naples. We have a strong tradition made of many superstitions, one of these is a mix between a kabala and a bingo with numbers going from 1 to 90 and each number has a meaning. These meanings are used to interpret dreams and decide the numbers to play at the lottery (ie if you dream of a great scare you'll play a 90 that is ""The Fear"" and so on). But... not everyone's dreams are as good for these predictions, the lore says! 

The most spot on ""dreamers"" are believed to be either the mediums or the femminielli. 

Femminiello refers to a very feminine boy with a very stereotypical set of mannerism who sometimes cross dresses but not always. Nowadays the term is used in a mocking way, but until some 30 years ago boys who showed an inclination towards this in the poorer classes were basically raised very much like the girls, learned how to sew and other things and then they were regarded as lucky charms and asked to bless houses in a profane way. 

Both the luck thing and the predictions were explained by saying that these men were in contact with their feminine nature and this made them more complete in a way.

I've never realised this is actually my culture explaining and accepting trans* people and I'm a little sad that the progress has kinda lumped all of this as just superstion without giving it a second thought.

Also this is only a Neapolitan thing as far as I know, other Italian regions don't have this figure.

Sadly there's not an opposite figure but girls who act and dress like boys are usually referred as a ""a boy made wrong"" which is saying ""you have a boy's brain but your body is the other one"" so it's kinda spot on nonetheless. 

I'm not an anthropologist or anything like that by any means, I'm just recounting my experience and what I've been told all my life so take it with a grain of salt.

2014-03-18 15:12:34,20q13k,21,37,"I don’t know what gender I identify as. I know I don’t feel comfortable being feminine, and I’m not happy with my female physical characteristics (in particular, breasts and periods). I feel like I have more masculine mental characteristics and tend to want a more masculine look, but I don’t think I really want certain male physical characteristics like a penis and facial hair either.

However, I do worry that what I’m identifying as feminine is based on stereotype rather than reality. Character traits that I feel make me masculine are primarily my assertive personality, my lack of interest in traditionally feminine things like makeup, fashion, and homemaking, and my interest in traditionally masculine things like military history and martial arts. Really, there’s no reason why those things should be assigned to men. I’ve always identified with male characters in fiction more, but I wonder if that’s just because female characters usually fall into stereotyped behaviour. I don’t want to fall into the “femmephobia” trap of thinking that feminine = bad.

As for my sexual orientation, I generally prefer masculine bodies, but I don’t really have any desire to have sex with anyone. I don’t have an aversion to sex and can definitely enjoy it in art and fiction, I’m just not that interested in actually doing it myself. I’ve had a male partner, mainly because I wanted to find out if I was missing out on anything, and it wasn’t an unpleasant experience but it wasn’t one I got much out of either.

Character traits that I feel make me masculine are primarily my assertive personality, my lack of interest in traditionally feminine things like makeup, fashion, and homemaking, and my interest in traditionally masculine things like military history and martial arts. Really, there’s no reason why those things should be assigned to men. I’ve always identified with male characters in fiction more, but I wonder if that’s just because female characters usually fall into stereotyped behaviour. I don’t want to fall into the “femmephobia” trap of thinking that feminine = bad.\n\nAs for my sexual orientation, I generally prefer masculine bodies, but I don’t really have any desire to have sex with anyone. I don’t have an aversion to sex and can definitely enjoy it in art and fiction, I’m just not that interested in actually doing it myself.

2014-03-21 21:32:43,21129g,3,10,"I see a therapist 1-2x a week and today we got down to some pretty deep stuff:

1. I hold my sister dear, she was always there for me when my parents would fight and yell and walk out of the house on each other. I was also there for her and acted as an older sibling to her (despite being 2 years younger) when she sank into a deep depression. My sister has been on her own at college (she's 20) for about 1.5 years now. I read about narcissistic identification, which occurs when you lose an object. I lost my sister in a sense as I rarely see her so now I am trying to identify as a girl to make up for that.

2. My mom began working again when I was in the 3rd grade. She hadn't worked at all throughout my childhood up until then and was always around and happy. When she started working she became busier and somewhat distant because she is a teacher and had to get her classwork and grading done at home. Even now she is often very distant and the only time she really gets up from her computer is when she goes to smoke cigs which I resent.

3. My dad wasn't around a lot when I was younger, often working 6 days a week. I have a memory from when I was 4 or 5 years old and seeing him and thinking ""I know who that is but he's a stranger."" I feel that he has very high standards for me, for example an A- in school is adequate but not very praise worthy. I noticed that he would always dish out love to my sister but I had to earn it, and even now when he tries to tell me he loves me and is proud of me I barely believe it despite him pouring his emotion into it. My sister would often get love from him very easily.

Here's the big whammy: today with my therapist, I talked about my sister being 'daddy's little girl.' He asked, ""Do you want to be daddy's little girl?"" and it sounded so right to me. I said yes. I felt open to love. But I want a different kind of love than the kind he's giving me. I feel that as a boy, as Matt, he would feel comfortable giving me the kind of love I'm looking for and so would I (very personal, close touch love - not incest lol) but now I'm 17 and would be kind of weird.

I'm not even sure if I'm comfortable being loved as a boy.

Even saying I'm a boy, it's like I know I am but... I'm so distant from the 'boy' gender and I kind of don't wanna be one. I feel like a failure as a guy, everywhere from school to sports to relationships even to my parents love. It's so hard for me to accept love I don't even know what's right and what's wrong. I often take someone trying to start a conversation with me as mocking me, and I see girls telling me they love me as very superficial.

Is this me wanting to be a girl or do I just want my father's love which I only see achievable through being 'daddy's little girl' ?

I know that's a question I have to ask myself but can you please help me out a bit? Any other subreddits I might want to post this to?

I was kinda hoping it would say something like child from the start but I guess not.\n\nAnd of course my parents haven\'t said anything so I\'m now wondering if they didn\'t see it, or they think it\'s just a mixup, or they\'re completely understanding and finally put it all together with the short haircut and androgynous clothing choices.\n\nJust wanted to vent a little, and also bring some awareness to the fact that Facebook is still a little mixed up for anyone else who might be in this situation.\n\n-**update 3/24/14**- I saw my Mom today, she didn\'t even notice the problem and we had a brief conversation about gender neutral pronouns and it was all good. And more interestingly, she logged onto her facebook account while I was there to change it, and since I had selected gender neutral pronouns on my facebook, the only choices she had on the drop down menu were gender neutral, all the way down to ""child of sibling."" I\'m glad to see they figured out a way around niece or nephew, however clumsy that is to say.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Facebook gender option mixup and accidentally outing myself', 'created': 1395552310.0}"

2014-03-24 00:55:01,216xda,3,8,"For a long time, I identified solidly as an AFAB heterosexual cis woman. I thought my mind's wanderings were more just me not fitting into the stereotypical definition of a woman—my brain works in a very analytic, scientific way, and I kind of feel like I'm a robot sometimes. A couple years ago, I discovered that I was gray-asexual and that really opened my eyes: what I thought was a personality quirk was actually a whole identity unto itself. So now I'm wondering the same thing about my gender: personality quirk? or something else?

To start, I wouldn't be upset if I HAD to identify as female for the rest of my life, but I have this vague sense that it doesn't fully capture my personality. I don't feel like my cognitive workings or personality traits belong to either gender. I am assertive, but that doesn't make me masculine, it just makes me assertive. I feel like my thoughts and the workings of my brain are gender-neutral. I want to be treated as a human first; I honestly feel like the only time my gender is relevant is when I talk to other women about the experience of being a woman in society AND in my relationship with my boyfriend, because I am comfortable relating to him romantically/sexually as a woman.

Here are some other facts (really unsure how to organize this post and I don't want to end up with a wall of text):  

* I am just fine with female pronouns. Do not want others.
* I like presenting as female; I like dresses and makeup.
* But sometimes I like wearing blazers and am fascinated with menswear. I wish I could dress more androgynously sometimes. I also wish I could try a pixie cut.  
* The reason I don't is because I would be VERY upset if I was mistaken for male.  
* I do not experience dysphoria.  
* I am very comfortable with my body (which is admittedly less feminine—not much fat/curves...) and do NOT want male body parts at all.  

So basically I want people to see me as female and I want to present as female but in a perfect world I just want to be myself because on the inside I am not particularly female, with the exceptions described above. Does that make any sense? 

So the options I've been considering are:  

* demigirl: I really dislike this word because ""girl"" sounds too young, but feeling kind of female but not does seem to fit me.  
* bigender or genderfluid: I mostly feel genderless (agender?) except for when I feel female.  
* femme: definitely fits with regard to how I present myself... even with the [menswear](http://femmedandy.tumblr.com/).
* genderqueer: I just don't really fit anywhere and this word is umbrella-like enough??  

On top of all this, I am wondering if I am just a cis girl who is trying too hard to be queer. I don't feel oppressed or anything (though I do feel like I can't fully be myself, like I would love to do a pixie cut and a blazer and tie with a dash of red lipstick, but people are assholes if you appear nonbinary and I just really don't want to draw attention to myself...), I don't experience dysphoria and am ok with my body, and even though I am gray-asexual, my preference is to date guys. ALSO I only really felt this way until recently when I started learning about all these identities: prior to a few years ago, I was just another cishet lady who felt like things were a little off. So I feel like that invalidates all this.

So I feel like maybe I'm a cishet who is trying too hard. But on the hand, I don't feel like that's true because ""cishet"" doesn't fully encompass what I am. If I was happy with that, I wouldn't be asking all these questions... I mean, I certainly wouldn't want to encroach on spaces reserved just for people who experienced dysphoria, or people who experienced same-gender attraction, or whatever specific thing, but I feel most comfortable around LGBTQ people and communities because they're places where I can mostly be myself and talk about these things...

So anyway, I'm confused and if you got this far and have any comments/advice or even questions I could ask myself to help me figure this out, I would really appreciate it.

I am biologically female and happy with that, and to be honest it never occurred to me that I might be anything else until I learned more about nonbinary genders and thought, ""holy shit, this androgyny thing makes a whole lot of sense.""

I don't really consider looks a part of it, because I think the genderization of clothing/makeup/hair is ridiculous. It's all based on personality. I feel like I have many female and many male qualities. However, it's hard to tell whether these qualities can legitimately be characterized as either male or female or are just ones that come from society's idea of binary genders. In other words, how do I know if I'm truly androgynous or just a female who doesn't conform to stereotypical female traits? Or, since gender is a societal construction, is there even a difference between those two things?

If there isn't, I guess my decision on whether or not to call myself androgynous rests on whether doing so would be harmful or helpful to breaking down traditional gender roles.
