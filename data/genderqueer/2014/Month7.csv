2014-07-01 03:42:29,29j8m1,7,13,"Okay, I guess I should give you a bit of background. I'm fifteen years old (no idea how to drive), MAAB, and my family is very religious.


I can already see the red flags going up in your heads.


Correction: The side of the family that I live with is very religious. I recently came to terms with my pangender identity, and my father and stepmother could not be more okay with that. Unfortunately, they live halfway across the country from me. My parents divorced about 8 or 9 years ago in Oklahoma, U.S.A., and my mother got custody because of some rare bizarre freak storm of total assholes in the legal system. These assholes also somehow managed to get into the health care system and all the places my dad tried to find work, and eight months ago, tired of getting repeatedly screwed over by random strangers, he moved to Washington state, where he is now kicking ass (but not as much financially, so we don't know if a legal attempt to take custody is an excellent idea, because my mother's family - we'll call them the Millers - has money out the asshole. I'll let you enjoy that mental picture.)


My mother is not very comfortable with the idea of me being androgynous, and by that I mean she totally flipped her shit when I first told her. My tendency towards feminine clothing alone sets her on edge, and she's definitely not going to change the pronouns she uses. She has me go to a counselor to talk about my gender (among other things, but she started making appointments when I came out to her). I'm not even going to talk about my dudebro stepfather.


I have plenty of other friends that accept me for who I am, and I haven't seen a single one of them for eight months. My mother outright forbids me from visiting my adult friends, and somehow something always comes in the way of me visiting my peers. Instead, my mother opts to take me (on those rare occasions when I don't stay home alone, bored, and lonely for about 9 waking hours a day) to see - guess who? - my very religious family members. None of whom accept me for who I am. I have no computer (they took it away), no cell phone (never had one in the first place), nothin'. I'm typing this on my 3DS, which is actually a huge pain in the ass, and it's really hard to vent. All I have is a house phone, and not only do I only have the phone numbers of my dad and one very religious friend, I definitely do not put it past the Millers to be recording my conversations (and if you think that's crazy, you don't know the Millers).


They took my computer away because A) I'm genderqueer and my potentially queer actions on the internet frighten them, and B) They were made even more suspicious of potentially queer actions when I watched Ouran High School Host Club on Netflix. Oh yeah, they turned Netflix off too.


I want to just go to live with my dad, but the Millers are about as okay with that as me wearing dresses. My mother is suspicious of their ""living situation"", because they work and live in a hostal, and my mother isn't comfortable with the idea of me being around reportedly awesome strangers on a regular basis. She is also suspicious that I won't attend high school, since my dad kicks ass at homeschooling and was probably a better teacher for me than most of the ones at my school (not because they are all bad teachers, but because they have to teach 30+ kids at once, whereas he only has to teach one). However, I have no objection to going to school in Washington, not to mention the fact that none of my ideal career choices (read: career choices I would ever consider choosing because I'll be damned if I'm going to spend half of every weekday doing something I don't enjoy) require a diploma or degree. Mom's argument against this is being suspicious of the quality of public education in Washington.


I'm more venting than asking for advice, but any that you might have to give is very welcome.

2014-07-02 16:15:56,29nrx3,2,7,"This started as a comment on another post but I realised I was getting a bit rambly and longwinded and decided to rewrite the whole thing from scratch.

It's been about a year and a half since I started to understand myself as specifically ""not male"". I first became aware of trans issues maybe five or six years ago but I never once considered – or allowed myself to consider – that any of the stuff I was educating myself on could be of any direct relevance to me. At some point I realised I had never actually asked myself, ""is it possible that I'm transgender?"". Short and incredibly reductionist version: I did exactly that, and I concluded that I was not ""a man"", and that that was OK. I also realised that I didn't want to identify myself as female instead of male. I became aware that I felt like I didn't belong in either of those categories, and I allowed myself to accept that it was OK to feel that way.

I grew up feeling all kinds of weird and bad ways about myself that I didn't have the experience or language to deal with constructively. I didn't factor any of it into gender stuff at the time. And for the most part I filed those feelings away and figured that feeling as though I didn't ""fit"" – both within myself, and the social contexts I moved in – was just run-of-the-mill existential angst. When I started being honest to myself about who and how I was, those feelings practically evaporated. And I've been doing a lot of thinking about what that means. For most of the time since the day I accepted myself as nonbinary, I've been telling myself ""I don't experience dysphoria"". While frequently having days when I'm so desperate to be more femme that it hurts. I'm generally OK with my body. I have zero issues with my junk. Despite not having to work through a ""wrong body"" narrative, I figure what I grew up feeling was a kind of dysphoria – nonspecific, and without direction, and without context. The times I feel dysphoric today are definitely rooted in a feeling of missing something, but at least now I have an idea of what I'm actually missing.

I'm still at a point where I'm just barely beginning to introduce changes to my presentation that I'm desperate to implement. And I know I'm still young, and I know there's no such thing as ""it's too late!"" in any of this. But I see people in their teens and younger who've grown up with access to these ideas, and they're out to their families and communities, and they get to approach adulthood while having far better a grasp on who they are than I could have ever dreamed of having during my adolescence. I don't buy into ""born this way"" and I don't even care if that's how it works; the etiology of my gender is totally irrelevant. I do know, though, that if I'd had the tiniest bit of awareness of the how and why of gender at, say, age 10, I would have rolled with it. I would've matured as a version of myself not desperately trying (and failing) to pass as just another ""boy"". I wish my parents had known the things I know. I wish my mother had been able to see something not-quite-right about the fact that I cried my eyes out whenever she announced it was time for a haircut until I was 11 or 12. We're all in this together, and each of our struggles is unique, but I'm still working past being jealous of those I perceive as having it better than me even though I consciously know those things and act on them.

That's that. Just a few thoughts I felt like putting down somewhere. As far as I'm concerned I've always been the way I am, and I'm trying to stop mourning what I can't help but see as lost time.

Been lurking a while and did a search, but didn't find quite what I was looking for. I'm moving cross-country for a new job, which is really exciting. It's a progressive workplace, very clearly cool with LGBT issues, but when I interviewed for the job, I was dressed very gender-normatively, based on recommendations from friends and family. I'm DFAB, so that meant I wore makeup and heels, something I literally never do in my personal life. I don't hate she/her pronouns, or my birth name (though I wouldn't mind switching to they/them or ze/hir at some point, and going by a more gender neutral name). Honestly anyone who saw me would probably never guess I had gender issues. I often wear dresses and sneakers, and keep my hair very short. I don't bind my breasts or act ""masculine"" per se. I guess I just don't think performing ""masculine"" dress or behavior actually indicates my gender. Why can't I be a boy who wears a dress, likes ""girly"" television shows, etc? I honestly think if it were acceptable, a huge amount of cis males would wear dresses, because it is so much easier than going through the trouble of putting on pants and a t-shirt. Especially as a slightly chubby person with big boobs, finding a dress that fits is soooo much easier than finding pants and shirts that fit.

Anyway, after all that background, here's my problem: I really, really don't want to wear makeup at work. I have nice boy shoes, some comfortable suits, and can definitely look super professional and put-together in my androgynous mode. But my job is sales-oriented, and I'm definitely the face of my organization. Does that mean my face needs to wear makeup? Should I just try to go without it and see if anyone complains? It's a great job and I don't want to sabotage it, but I also really, really don't want to wear makeup. I don't feel comfortable in it, I don't feel confident. I feel irritated to get straight male attention and to be perceived as a straight woman while I wear it. I want to feel comfortable at my job, and while I don't feel the need to let them know about my genderqueerness/preferred pronouns/boyish nickname, I feel really strongly about this one aspect. For the most part, I don't care about how people perceive me and my gender, because my gender identity is deep inside me. But wearing makeup makes me feel dysphoric and sad and angry, and I don't want to feel that way at work.

I have a friend who does identify as ""genderqueer"". However I'm questioning if I'm an ""extreme tomboy""  or  ""genderqueer.""

Here's my actual dilemma though. I feel like I've got male programming.  I have issues making friends who are of the same physical gender as me. I don't feel like I fit in with other females unless they're extremely masculine like myself. I feel like my brain isn't right for my physical anatomy. I do not feel that I need to alter my body in anyway. 

However I do wear mens clothes mainly, I do not bind, but I have a habit of wearing sports bras to hide my boobs. I'm not ashamed of having a female body, I just don't see the reason for having it. I don't have a strong enough urge to fully reassign, or gender-bend.

As I said, I don't feel as if I'm totally transgender and needing reassignment. However I don't really feel like I'm a ""woman"" either. I just feel like my brain is programmed male, I associate better with the male gender.

tl;dr, Brain isn't programmed right for my physical gender, but not extreme enough for reassignment or title of trans*.

Maybe we can post links to shops that have clothes that other nonbinary people find helpful? I apologize if maybe there's another topic for this--I'm new to reddit.

I'm nonbinary but go mostly by she/her pronouns. I don't really have dysphoria except for my boobs (which I don't want to get rid of, I just don't like presenting with them) and I wish my shoulders were broader. I also happen to be very small (5'2"" and 90 lbs). This means I have a hard time finding clothes that fit, because I am trying to present less feminine.

Where I go:

1. So far, my best go-to resource is Topman. They have a rotating set of sales online. I especially like their t-shirts and button-downs. The XXS shirts fit me very well, as long as they are of thin material (I have a couple of shirts of thicker material that look way too big because they shrink less). When their stuff isn't on sale, though, it's way too pricy.

2. Old Navy. Some of their women's button downs actually look acceptably neutral if you bind, and their prices are typically reasonable.

3. Goodwill for genderqueers on a budget. All of the clothes have been washed like 800 times, so they shrink a lot. I've found a lot of good men's clothes from one of the Goodwills in my state.

4. Online Asian clothing stores like Trendykey and TheLees. I haven't bought anything yet, but I have a few options open in tabs from stores I found on Amazon. They actually get bad reviews because American guys try to buy their clothes and their sizes run so small.

5. All of my binders are from Underworks. Make sure you buy a size up of your usual size--I have a couple of XS binders and I always get horrible heartburn when I wear them.

6. H&amp;M. I have some shirts from the young boys' section, and their suspenders are great. Also some of their women's shirts are cut more neutrally. Their pants also go waist x length instead of by size, which is helpful.

If anyone has any other resources for tiny people, please let me know. Now that I've accepted my gender as non-cis, I'm like obsessed with my appearance and I enjoy presenting nonbinary about half the time, so I want to find more clothes I can do that with.

Or if anyone has any go-to shops they like in general, please post!

After a quite awkward and personal conversation with my mum last week, following me saying I was feeling more girly - or ""having those feeling"" as she calls it - she asked what I want to do to ""cope"" with these feeling of dysphoria - she hasn't a fucking clue still, but that's for another day!

I said one thing would be to grow my hair to a more androgynous length but *instantly* she said I can't because my ""hair grows out and all bushy on top so it is not possible to grow it down"" at all! - bitch, I get the impression, even though she's never said, that she doesn't like be being trans*!

Anyway, is this true? Is it actually possible I have hair which I can't grow down?

Is this just my mum talking bull because she doesn't want me to grow my hair to a more girly length or what? 

**TL;DR?** Basically my mum instantly refused to let me grow my hair because its ""the wrong type"" and I need to concvince her otherwise as she's right now being stubbon and in denial plus she doesn't really like the idea of me being trans* 

Thanks :)

They are pretty big (D) and I've never found a binder or button up that did a decent job of concealing them. When I am stressed out the dysphoria gets worse. Additionally, I have back problems, probably at least partially due to their size. Yet, I identify as a butch dyke, not a man. Just a dyke who doesn't want her boobs. 

Has anyone who isn't strictly ftm had top surgery done? If so, what did you need to do? Did you need a letter from a therapist or counselor? Was it covered by insurance?

2014-07-10 19:00:54,2acu4r,20,7,"First of all, I apologize for the rambling post. 

As a little background, I identify as transmasculine/genderqueer. I like to wear some things on occasion that are traditionally female (dresses, makeup) but I don't feel that I am female. I don't have plans to take T currently, namely because male pattern baldness runs in my family. I want to look more masculine, but I'm also not sure that I want to live full time as a man yet or ever. I don't relate to having a female body and have intense dysphoria about my breasts and occasionally my vagina, but I don't particularly want to go bald, or have facial hair, or undergo surgery other than top surgery. My current goal has been to lose weight and build muscle and have a more androgynous appearance.

I'm starting grad school in the fall and another user on here mentioned asking my classmates and professors to call me by my preferred name off the bat, or it'll be difficult to get them to change once they've gotten used to my birth name. I don't have a huge problem with my birth name, but it's a name that's exclusively female and there's no male equivalent. I think I've settled on a male name - Siegfried (I study German language/history so I felt that it was a good fit for me) or Sig/Sigi (said like Zig/Ziggy) as a nickname. My birth name also starts with S, and the nickname for it is a name more typically used for kids, and I feel like the nickname ""Sigi"" has the same playful kind of sound as my birth name nickname.

The only issue is, if I ask people to call me Siegfried, then it'll out me immediately, and I'm not sure I want to draw attention to myself like that as soon as I start a new school. Sigi is a little more gender neutral - it can be a nickname for Sigrid (a female name) as well - but pretty uncommon in the US. I'm going to grad school for German history, so it's likely most of my professors and my classmates will be familiar with the name.

I can't really pass as a man currently, nor am I sure I really want to. I don't want to feel ashamed or weird for wearing makeup or dresses once in a while. I also don't want to feel like to express the male part of myself, I have to hide the feminine things that I like. But pretending to be a ciswoman doesn't really work for me either because that's not who I am.

So my question is, what is your advice? Do you think it would be a big deal to ask my professors to call me by a male name if I don't plan on presenting full-time as a male? I've thought about picking a more common gender neutral name, but nothing really appeals to me because I really do like Sigi and I feel that it represents me better than Sam or something.",genderqueer,Deciding on a name and questions about going by a different name,1405044054.0,"{'created_utc': 1405018854, 'id': '2acu4r', 'num_comments': 20, 'score': 7, 'selftext': 'First of all, I apologize for the rambling post. \n\nAs a little background, I identify as transmasculine/genderqueer.

2014-07-15 00:57:50,2apxvj,1,13,"Hello, everyone! I'm feeling more than a little scatterbrained at the moment, and I have quite a bit on my mind, so I'm having difficulty expressing the things I want to express and put my feelings into words other people can understand. 

I grew up (and now live in) a highly conservative environment, and I am fairly isolated from the trans* community and from people in general. For years I had nothing but (sadly common) misconceptions about the word ""transgender"", and wasn't even aware of non-binary/genderqueer gender identities until I began doing serious research on the subject over the past year and a half or so. Suddenly, a lot of things are starting to ""click"" for me. I'm now starting to form an entirely different way to approach gender, and humanity in general; as well as a feeling of validation that there is actually a community filled with people who may share my feelings and acknowledge my identity. 

I'm a 23 year old AMAB person who has been ""struggling"" with gender for literally as long as I can remember. Even as a very young child I was confused as to why being a ""boy"" excluded me from doing certain things I wanted to do; and later, frustrated to the point of despair that I was actively being repressed from being able to express myself. My feelings of shame, fear, and what I know now as dysphoria, led me into juvenile delinquency, and a high-risk lifestyle. I was willing to take what I thought was acceptance from anyone, and abused drugs and alcohol in a suicidal fashion until I became a parent almost three years ago. Now that the dust of my early youth has settled, and there has been some calm in my life, I've started what I think of as a true awakening to myself. I'm now getting ready to take the next step, and reach out to others. Now that I'm figuring out who I am, I want to be connected to the world in a way that feels true and honest. 

I've started to identify myself as Genderqueer, but beyond that I'm not sure what other terms I would identify myself with. What I do know, is that I don't feel like a ""man"". Adhering to the ""man"" archetype was something I always felt difficulty in doing. It never came naturally. It was something I was taught. I tend to go from periods of feeling unbiased about my gender, to periods of acute dysphoria and longing to be female. It sort of comes in waves, and if I have triggers, I haven't been able to identify them yet. I am still presenting publicly as male (especially at work), and am trying to introduce more androgyny into my daily presentation steps-by-step. I'm making progress on gaining the confidence to express my gender openly.

The only person I've talked to about this is my girlfriend (and best friend for nearly a decade :D), and after a short time of confusion, she's become exceedingly supportive and accepting of me - despite my grim expectations. She's certainly been the source of a lot of my momentum in all aspects of life. My almost 3-year old son deserves my honesty, and I have made no attempt to hide my identity from him. He makes very few distinctions regarding the way I present myself, and the distinctions he does make are positive.

Now, as I've said, I think I'm ready to reach out to other people, and I could use some advice on some things.

I'm trying to think of a way to ""come out"" to friends and family members, but I don't think I'm truly prepared to answer a volley of questions. Does anybody have suggestions on how to educate people about non-binary gender identities?

I want to be involved in the trans* community, and human rights activism. I'm a passionate feminist, but speaking out against sexism and discrimination exclusively among co-workers and acquaintances doesn't feel like enough. Which online/offline communities would you recommend I contact? What organizations should I look into?

Lastly, I've been thinking about going to see a counselor/doctor who specializes in helping people like me. Any advice on finding a good counselor in the state of Indiana?

But she keeps using thing like ""ladies"" and the content is heavily focused on what it means to be a woman and deal with woman struggles with body stuff and it's really frustrating that she thinks it's okay to use.

If you could give me a hand here and provide some responses to my.... er, poll, it would be greatly appreciated! My questions, mainly, are these:
 
1)    How old were you when you began struggling to ascertain your identity in a gender-binary society?

2)     Where does your drive in life come from? Surely it would be easier to assimilate and assume an identity that you don't necessarily agree with for simplicities sake?

3)      How often and in what ways do you feel discriminated against?

4)       Why is that so many of you feel the need to express yourself through your (arguably extreme) fashion choices? This undoubtedly leads to people prejudging you, so why bother?

5)        How has your family reacted?

6)        How has your love life been impacted? In this neck of the wood, it seems like they aren't many fish in the sea.

Sorry if at any point I was rude, curt, or condescending. If you could answer any or all of these questions and add any information you think is vital, let me hear it! Please!

2014-07-17 20:17:06,2azh3z,7,10,"Hey. I'm really seriously new at this, so forgive me if I ramble a bit. (added midway through:) In fact, I just realized I am rambling a bit, so I'll put a TL;DR at the bottom. Sorry.

I've known I was... something ""else""... since I was a kid, even if I didn't begin to understand what or how to express it. I went back and forth on whether I liked being a ""girl"", which drove my mother to frustration. I had imaginary friends that were male. I started drawing pictures when I was six of a boy who was just like me except he did all the things I wanted to do but couldn't. (I told my mother and teachers he was my imaginary boyfriend because I was convinced I was supposed to have those.) When I was eight, my mother started pushing hard for me to act more like a girl, even encouraging me to enter in a Young Miss beauty contest at one point, but it never took. Bear in mind, I wanted to be normal. I wore dresses for special occasions (albeit under protest), tried to keep up with my hair, played at having little kid boyfriends, even managed to look sideways at my baby sisters' play makeup stand, though I couldn't bring myself to actually wear the stuff. It never felt completely right.

Puberty made everything more pronounced, especially since I apparently hit the ""genetic jackpot"". I got very hourglass-y, my tits came out fast and huge (US size 6 figure with DD cups by the time I was sixteen), and my already relatively high singing voice soared so far into soprano range I could have gone operatic if I wanted. All of which I was clueless about until years later, but I absolutely noticed how people treated me and expected me to dress and behave. I explained away my inability to fully pull this off by joking about growing up with a ""70% male brain"", knowing no one would take that seriously. When I was fourteen, I realized the boy I kept drawing looked like me for a reason, and I freaked out and told my parents I'd had a psychotic episode. I worked even harder trying to be normal, to the point of severe overcompensating, even while everything in me fought against it and knew what I was doing to myself was wrong. I wanted to fit, and I convinced myself that the ""fake it 'til you make it"" approach was the only way that was going to happen.

As time went by (and my efforts to pretend to be normal got more self-destructive), I tried various, ""more acceptable"" forms of coming out, but I was met with blanket identity denial (even from the Gay Straight Alliance I tried to join in high school when I was trying being bi instead of straight as I didn't know what asexual was), accusations of being in a ""phase"", No True Scotsman arguments, and various forms of freaking out from my friends, exes, significant others, and parents. All of these resulted in my running back into the closet so hard I became a caricature of a ditsy, slutty, bisexual cis just to convince them (and myself) that I was being randomly crazy and it wasn't real. All the while, I kept having gender-bending dreams, mild to moderate issues with the way I felt not matching the mirror, and various other communications from my subconscious that the labels I kept attaching to myself were wildly inaccurate.

When I was 23, I finally started acknowledging that the days when I woke up with what I termed ""phantom dick syndrome"" and the times when I suddenly, physically felt like my tits and hips weren't actually part of my body were not the passing fantasies of a crazy person. I'd been collecting friends and associations in the LGBTQ community for a few years, so I knew what genderqueer was, but I still wasn't ready to actually do something about it. I knew I wasn't trans since I wasn't like this all the time, so I figured I could just ignore it and be fine. Except I wasn't. Even in my ignoring, it had been coming out for years. I bought fedoras. I cut my hair. I developed a minor obsession with button down shirts. I learned how to wear a tie. I researched breast binding, and then cried because my I-cups couldn't be corralled. I raged against the very concept of a ""pantsuit"" on the grounds of gender conformity. I lusted after Matt Bomer's wardrobe in White Collar. I bitched about women's shoes being more form than function while wearing men's shoes hurt my feet. I fell in love with the webcomic El Goonish Shive and wished Tedd's TF gun could be real. I tried to make my voice lower, virtually destroying my singing voice in the process, and internally bitched whenever I caught myself speaking in my higher tones. And I fought, denied, and handwaved every single bit of it whenever someone pointed out that my closet was gaining transparency.

Last November, I moved to Salt Lake City to get away from my midwest baggage and start over. Problem was, I still couldn't cope with expressing my gender identity and refused to even acknowledge my asexuality. Until I made friends with the first person in my life who saw right through me and called my bullshit for what it was. He all but forced me to confront my asexuality, for which I will always thank him, and helped me realize it wasn't a shortcoming or a romantic death sentence. It's just me, and that was ok. I'm fairly certain he knows about the genderqueer/andro/genderfluid thing, too, even though I'm just in the last 24 hours deciding to accept and act on that one, largely due to a combination of his repeatedly telling me ""Just be who you are"" and my roommate being phenomenally supportive when I effectively broke down in his doorway last night.

So, here I am. I'm 27, asexual, gender... something..., and worn out from a lifetime of lies and denial. I'm terrified how my family is going to react. I'm daunted by the amount of weight I have to lose and muscle I have to build so I can get my breast reduction and start to look like myself. I still have bits in my head of my own making pressuring me to feminize. In spite of this, and the challenges I know I'll face thanks to genetics, I'm ready to stop trying and just be myself. To misquote Fall Out Boy, I'm ready to change like a remix and rise like a phoenix. To that end, I've followed the advice of my roommate and come here to share my story and find people who both understand and will be willing to help me deal with the hard parts, like my voice and my hips and getting people not to be weirded out because my gender expression changes with the wind. And my parents. Holy cow my parents...

2014-07-21 23:33:18,2bce5f,14,4,"Hey Reddit,

As the title says, I've had a bit more than a little wondering exactly what I am. I'm biologically male, but not entirely happy with it. Not entirely unhappy with it, either. 

Some days, being a dude is great. I like all the convenient bits, like peeing standing up and being able to kiss and sex ladies without being judged for it, and PIV is pretty great from my standpoint. Admittedly, I'm not the most experienced guy out there by any means. But if any of my lady friends were down for bonin', I would say hell yes. Additionally, I like being so naturally strong and big most days. Put that together with my goofy personality and I just feel and act like a big cuddly teddy bear. Moustaches and beards are cool as hell, haha. 

On the other hand, some days I just couldn't feel more wrong about the situation. I want to wear a dress, a miniskirt, or a bikini and go out in public. And not in drag. I know men who could pass as women pretty easily, and me? No way in hell. I'm broad shouldered, muscled, and while I like my beard and moustache most days, I grow visible stubble in ~2 hours after shaving. Trying to go around convincingly would be a nightmare. When I fantasize about putting myself on display like that, it would definitely be as a completely different person. There's the sexual desires too. I don't know if it's strange, but as a man I don't think I'd be up for more than kissing other men. But as a woman... both when I've watched and performed acts like PIV or eating a woman out, as much as I've enjoyed it personally I've always though *godDAMN* that looks fun. I'm also, I think, a pretty big sub. I know that isn't dependent on gender, but most women expect men to be the initiator in most parts of the relationship, sexual or otherwise. I would really have liked the opportunity to try sexual acts with a different set of parts, both with men and women. Additionally, I would have really liked to have been a mother. Nothing seems more serene and peaceful than a pregnant mother (without massive morning sickness or other complications, I know) and it feels incredibly unfair that I won't ever get to experience that because of how I was born.

So yeah. I've thought about transitioning and decided it really, really wasn't for me. Some days I really, really like being a guy. But the days I don't make me question who exactly I am. Some days I think that in a perfect world I would have been a rowdy tomboy, but that's not possible, haha. 

Does anyone have any idea? I know labels don't define people, but I'd like some tips so I can start finding out about people a little more like me.

I'm biologically male, but not entirely happy with it. Not entirely unhappy with it, either. \n\nSome days, being a dude is great. I like all the convenient bits, like peeing standing up and being able to kiss and sex ladies without being judged for it, and PIV is pretty great from my standpoint. Admittedly, I'm not the most experienced guy out there by any means. But if any of my lady friends were down for bonin', I would say hell yes. Additionally, I like being so naturally strong and big most days. Put that together with my goofy personality and I just feel and act like a big cuddly teddy bear. Moustaches and beards are cool as hell, haha. \n\nOn the other hand, some days I just couldn't feel more wrong about the situation. I want to wear a dress, a miniskirt, or a bikini and go out in public. And not in drag. I know men who could pass as women pretty easily, and me? No way in hell. I'm broad shouldered, muscled, and while I like my beard and moustache most days, I grow visible stubble in ~2 hours after shaving. Trying to go around convincingly would be a nightmare. When I fantasize about putting myself on display like that, it would definitely be as a completely different person. There's the sexual desires too. I don't know if it's strange, but as a man I don't think I'd be up for more than kissing other men. But as a woman... both when I've watched and performed acts like PIV or eating a woman out, as much as I've enjoyed it personally I've always though *godDAMN* that looks fun.

2014-07-23 05:30:40,2bgxtq,9,9,"AMAB here. I've identified as theoretically genderqueer for a while now, but mostly I never really engaged with it emotionally. So I've always presented as basically masculine, save for androgynous (maybe femmey?) glasses and hair and perhaps some personality traits. Physically I'm tall, big-shouldered, and with a high but basically masculine voice in a male-dominated career.

Well, a few weeks ago some big emotional walls came down and gender identity issues started to really hit home hard. They haven't let up since. And I'm okay with that: It's a ton of exhausting processing, but I'm excited to finally be dealing with it. I'm not sure whether I'll come out of this with a feminine identity or if I'll feel comfortable staying for a while in a genderqueer or nonbinary bucket. I'm pretty sure I'll never feel comfortable identifying or presenting 100% masculine again, though. I'm in no rush to figure that out, and I'm fortunate to have the help of an awesome therapist and loved ones as I explore.

My question, though, is about facial hair and electrolysis. I feel pretty comfortable right now saying I'll never want facial hair again. And since electrolysis typically takes a year or more to complete, it makes sense to me to start soon. The thing is, I'm still doing a ton of personal work to figure out where I'm comfortable with regard to gender presentation, and in the meantime I'm just not crazy about the idea of coming out as GQ at work. Right now I'd rather wait and cross that bridge after I start HRT (which may never happen, but it seems likely right now) and my body forces the issue. And even after things settle down, I may still like to present in boy-mode sometimes.

So I guess my question is this: If I start electrolysis without any immediate plans for HRT, how much can I expect that to feminize my face? Should I expect to keep basically passing as masculine until I'm ready to cross that bridge? My facial hair today is moderately dense and dark enough against my Caucasian skin that I can see a little shadow even right after shaving, and I definitely have some stubble by the end of the day. Getting it zapped away will not only remove that shadow, but if I understand correctly it may also slightly reshape my lips and chin since they won't be puffed up squirting out sandpaper. People will notice, obviously, but will strangers passing me in the hall be more likely to think ""Wow, he looks a tiny bit feminine in the face,"" or will it be enough to make people start doing a double take and Knowing That Person Is Weird (TM)?

Guess I'm just anxious and looking for some reassurance and perspective. Thanks!

I created this reddit account specifically to present myself as a genderqueer/non-conforming person. I hope talking with people, answering questions and commenting as a fully open and sexually positive queer person will encourage truth and openness in real life.

I'm 25 and barely starting to understand the basics of my sexuality. At the age of 22, I came out as queer to my closest friends and close family but I generally present and am perceived as a straight man. I'm a male bodied person. I've only ever had straight sex/relationships.  I would like to identify as neither straight nor man. I feel somehow that I must 'earn' this queer label though homosexual acts. At the same time I (try to) reject these thoughts as oppressive. I feel the same burden of proof concerning my gender queerness.

At 21, I remember figuring out that I wasn't straight, that I was attracted to women as well as men, and it all came together. Pieces of my past, bits of confusion over boys, liking 'gay stuff' and other things all formed an obvious bisexual picture. I couldn't believe it took me so long to admit/figure it out. I had had people ask me if I was gay, tell me I was gay, not like me because I was gay, and even tell me I would figure out later that I was gay!!! but I completely denied and disbelieved everything. 
*I no longer identify as bisexual though*

I haven't been so lucky to have such an epiphany regarding my gender though. I feel uncomfortable in my giant man body. I HATE IT...sometimes. My body has its advantages for sure, and I must address that my straight/white presentation provides me with a privilege that most queers do not have, but I feel trapped. I wouldn't pass as a female in 100yrs and I'm sad about it. I'm so insecure about my body and gender, I feel like my genetics got swirled around. As a child I feared that one day my parents would tell me they had to choose my gender at birth and that I had been somewhere in between. I even imagined some kind of procedure to 'make' me a male(crazy right?)(This has no basis in fact as far as I know.)

I really don't want to be a man but I also don't want to be a woman. I'm really confused. 
* 
* I want to be more feminine without being sexist.
* I want to be more aggressive in finding a partner but want to be submissive.
* I want to be open and honest but want to be subtle.
* I want to attract queers without looking obviously queer.
* I want to reject the gay scene but I really fucking wish I was involved.
* I want to be super cute but I'm a giant. 
* I want impossible things. I want a new body.

I reject the idea of traditional male/female roles in relationships but can't help but align with more female roles. 

I'm insecure about being so old and so confused. Who would want to entertain such an experienced person? 

I've felt I wasn't gay enough, straight enough, or queer enough.

Lovely community here that I'm slowly trying to be active in :) As I try to actively express my gender identity IRL as well. So after some trial and error with used/vintage dresses and skirts and stuff, I put together a simple outfit via ASOS that I really like (tank top + skater skirt).

I really like this kind of look! It's comfortable, shades of both feminine and punk, etc. I currently also have a polka-dot (black and white) skirt, longer than this one, and a floral skirt, shorter.

For most my life I have struggled to find a comfortable place for my gender, and what exactly it is and how to express it. It wasn't until the start of 2013 that I really started to dig deeper and deeper about my identity. I grew to have such a dsyphoria of my body, I needed to hide away my chest because it felt weird, I started slowly dressing in more and more men's clothes. That video, spoke to me so deeply. I was almost brought to tears because what I saw in the video of Ruby Rose, was so similar to how I used to be. Forcing myself to be feminine while lying to myself. I made the first move to change my gender on facebook an hour after seeing this video. I've been listening to the song it comes with a few times now, and now the song is on repeat. I went and changed my pronoun to gender neutral terms because I feel that will fit me for now. I changed my name on facebook to become my gender neutral nickname. It's never felt so scary and amazing to do so! I am not yet used to pronouns but I also know that if someone identifies me as anything girly I won't have it, and that maybe after a few years I may realize I am a ftm trans, but above all, this video was so powerful, that it literally has moved me to make a step toward understand myself and being more comfortable in my own skin. It's been awhile since I posted here because I had an ex boyfriend that made me feel bad about my dsyphoria calling it ""gender confusion"" and saying that he didn't get what ""genderqueer"" was exactly and asking me to get more ""feminine"" hair cuts, but I'm glad that I didn't let his words sway me against being myself and let him completely destroy my self esteem. I am so glad to watch this video and I am so glad to be back here talking to everyone and sharing this with all of you. I was going to grow my hair out because I was feeling dsyphoria over people mistaking me for a guy, but pretty soon I am going to just cut my hair short, similar to Ruby Rose's style, because I feel so much more comfortable with short hair.

2014-07-28 10:37:57,2bxmj8,3,6,"I'm not entirely sure where I'm going with this, but the process of _writing_ it out helps me _figure_ it out, so thanks in advance for reading.

tldr: I'm a non-dysphoric heteroflexible dude who doesn't feel the need to transition, but would probably rather be a masculine girl than a femme guy. Unsure of where to go from here.

another tldr: dammit, can't I be a hot guy with a beard and boobs who sucks his girlfriend's dick?

Long version: I'm a 29-year old male, slender but not skinny, masculine but not buff, hairy all over.
I was homeschooled, and didn't have a dad, so my male influences growing up were pretty much nonexistent. I had a small amount of dysphoria related to my genitals before I started going through puberty - I always peed to sit down because I didn't like to touch myself there - but all that changed when I discovered masturbation around 11, and I've been a proud owner of a penis ever since. I had a brief stint with crossdressing around that age, privately and purely for the sexual rush, but it was isolated to only a couple incidents (don't remember why).

I got along *way* better with girls than with guys, and to an extent, still do; it wasn't until college that I learned how to relate to other dudes, and really own my masculine form. I never dressed femme, though I also never dressed stylish at all, and it wasn't until the past few years that I started developing a personal style and being seen as someone who took pride in his appearance. I enjoy dressing up and being dapper, though sometimes I envy women's pattern choices and options for accessorizing.

I've always had girlfriends, always been attracted to women, and women have always been attracted to me. It wasn't until this past year that I ended a long-running series of relationships to pursue being single. I'm highly social and well-liked, with a great group of friends, and I don't feel put into any particular boxes I don't want to be in.

I've *always* had a fascination with gender transformations and trans* porn. I consider myself a strong trans* ally, so I've wrestled with my attraction, as I don't want to be a chaser. But I can't help that the MtF form is incredibly attractive to me, and my first sexual experience as a single guy was with my trans* friend, which confirmed the attraction wasn't just in my head. I'll reiterate that I don't feel dysphoric, but the idea of transforming feels incredibly erotic to me (which I'm well-aware is often a cis fantasy).

I identify as heterosexual, which I've interpreted more broadly to mean attraction to feminine energy. I'm attracted to women, whether AFAB or not, and occasionally more feminine guys, though I don't consider myself bi. Lately, I've begun noticing a stronger attraction to women with a sense of what I interpret as masculine energy - presenting very feminine, but with undercuts, tats, piercings - and I'm not sure where on the ""want her or want to *be* her"" continuum it falls. I still love soft cute women, and have no desire to be one.

Sexually, I consider myself a switch, since I can easily and gladly dom for someone, but would like more opportunities to be dominated myself. Really, I prefer the idea of complete equality, struggling for power in the bedroom and not always getting it.

So, here's where I stand right now. I'm a successful, non-dysphoric guy, who's starting to feel the urge to ""regress towards the mean"" a little bit, by which I mean incorporate more femininity into my life, though I don't know quite what that looks like. I'm highly attracted to the *idea* of myself as female, but I don't feel a strong need to transition; it's more that I would have chosen to be born that way if I could do it over. 

I actively enjoy my masculinity and don't necessarily want to sacrifice it, or be interpreted as presenting gay; in fact, I'm proud of my muscular legs, and want to work out more to improve my arms. I just want more femininity as well.  I'm open to starting small (but haven't yet) with crossdressing privately, and seeing if that stirs anything up, and continuing to incorporate jewelry and slightly more feminine aspects into my daily dress, striving for balance. [Conchita Wurst](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/files/2014/05/conchitawurst.jpg) is an inspiration, as is [His Black Dress](http://hisblackdress.com), though I don't necessarily want to be either of them.

I'm nearing 30, and if I actually _am_ trans*, I'd like to figure it out so I have time to do something about it. I've considered DIY HRT to get a sense for if _that_ stirs anything up, but this thought process is really only a few days old and I don't want to open that Pandora's box just yet.

And for a final exercise, I explored some of the nonbinary and genderqueer tags on tumblr to gauge my reaction to various presentations.

I threw in as many pieces of information as I could, and a lot of it is contradictory. I\'d be very curious to hear your interpretations and ideas.

I've spend months trying to figure out my gender identity and I'm sure I'm gender fluid. But sometimes I just feel different and broken, that I'll struggle to get into a relationship because of it and my mum is struggling to understand it. It's awful just not being able to do anything when I feel more girly or neutral. I know what I want (e.g. wear some girls clothes, neutral name and pronouns, remove body hair etc.) but I don't know how I can tell my mum this as she think this is the be-all and end-all and this ""thing will never be normal again"". She knows I'm trans* but judging from how she's struggled to accept that I daren't tell her I'm (grey) asexual yet [(see here for more on that)](http://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/2bxytg/my_asexual_problems/).   I just feel really down sometimes and upset that I'm a weirdo and not normal. I don't really know what I'm asking here I'm just hoping for some advice on how I can...I don't know, sorry :( I just feel kinda hopeless and messed up :(

I tried them on because I've been considering adding cute feminine clothes into my androgynous look to balance it out and make my boyfriend happy (he didn't request this, and he never tells me to dress more feminine, he always tells me to just be comfortable) , but now I'm thinking maybe it's impossible.
