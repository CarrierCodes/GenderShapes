2018-10-02 18:21:21,9kt5p1,5,1,"We have two Facebook group chats among my circle of friends. One where the more social justice-minded folks in the circle hang out, one full of cis folks shitposting. The attitude towards LGBT issues in the latter has an air of the ""I don't hate gay and trans people, but I wish they'd stop shoving it down my throat"" lowkey kind of hostility.

The other night in the former group chat, two people came out as genderqueer, so I decided to open up too. Everyone was voicing how proud they were of us, and posted some general enby positivity, and it was so validating since the only people I'd come out to up until then (my mother and a dear childhood friend) had both reacted in a very lukewarm, ""I kind of understand this but I'm not calling you by your preferred pronouns because it's too hard for me"" way.

A couple days ago, someone in the shitpost-y chat mentioned me being nonbinary, and thanks to that, now everyone in that (larger) chat knows. When I tried to casually say ""yo so how'd you know I'm nonbinary anyway? I didn't think I'd mentioned it to you yet"" in as non-confrontational of a manner as possible, even saying I wouldn't be angry, he dodged the question twice. He currently lives with my aforementioned childhood friend, and they definitely have that kind of close friendship where you tell each other everything. Either my childhood friend outed me, or someone in the chat I came out to did, and scarily, I'm leaning towards my childhood friend.

I feel so betrayed, and the worst part is, I don't even know who betrayed my trust. Who else have they told? Will they take my secret to the rest of my family? What kind of scathing looks and snide remarks at the family Christmas get-together will I receive then? Or worse, what if this information makes its way to my employers? I've only known I'm nonbinary for a little over a year, so I'm still mentally processing everything and figuring out how to broach the subject. Now my ability to do so on my terms with my own words has been ripped away from me by someone who I entrusted with my secret.

It's past 4:00am here and I've been struggling to sleep over the last couple of nights. I've got that numb, almost out of body feeling you get when something awful like this happens. I haven't been able to get anything done, I keep getting distracted with thoughts about what's going to happen from here. I know it's not the worst tragedy I could face in the grand scheme of things, but it's still terrifying, mostly because of the unknown. Not knowing who else knows now, and not knowing who I can still trust.

I don't think there's much of a solution beyond waiting it out and privately asking my childhood friend if he told him, but the thought of doing that is awful when I'm already so torn up about this whole thing. I'm going to try to get some sleep now, hopefully having talked about this to someone who will understand will calm my mind down enough for some proper rest.

Hey there, I started a blog about my lifelong ambivalent relationship to my masculinity and my journey to get my castration last year. Right now my goal is to be agender or asexual, but we'll see how this goes. I am not sure if I'm gender queer, but I think I'm dealing with some of the same issues, and certainly getting my castration was a big step towards realizing my identity and dealing with my dysphoria.

The whole thing feels like a roller coaster now.

I've felt a lot like sharing my worries with more closer people, mainly telling them to be supportive if I start becoming 'weird', and that while I may start looking like it, I'm not trans.

But I've abstained so far because I don't want to get more into what could be an error. They're all emotionally unavailable persons anyway, and they won't be able to help with my looks or clothing ‚Äînever did as males anyway.

I too haven't been able to try much until then. I'm taking it very slowly. The only thing I've tried was getting rid of my body hair, and while it was fun and exciting, that's about it, indifference ensued. It felt sort of nice to go out knowing I had no body hair underneath, but that's about it. Today I have a doctor visit, and I'm ashamed to be seen that way.

I'm also trying to get my hair long enough again to try a bun like I had when I was younger, but I don't have good hair anymore, so that'll be hard.

---

Right now, I'm back at wondering something I thought a lot in my early twenties, which was the absolute lack of femininity in my life.

As a kid and a teenager, I never had any female friends. My family was all masculine too, we were four brothers without girlfriends, and a mother that was everything but feminine. Nothing in my home was remotely feminine.

Since then, the only few FWB relationships I've had didn't bring me much of that either. While I liked them a lot, I wasn't able to get anywhere close to the female reality. They know I had image problems, but never took the risk of helping me out. They'd tell me I'm not masculine, but wouldn't care for me looking good as someone who wasn't masculine. 

Now, I'm mostly having trouble **sorting what I want in me and what I'd like in someone else**. I feel like this is a very deep and troubling question. I know love women, even if they're not feminine, but I am a person who is avid of knowledge, and I feel such a strong need to experiment this part of life that I never got remotely close it, and that because I won't ever be able to, I feel like I have to experiment it in myself. But at the same time, doing so in a way that affected my image, would be an humiliation, like publicly saying ""I've definitely become crazy"".

Because I have this strong identity void (I'm actually aiming to be tested for a Personality Disorder, potentially a Dependent and/or Avoidant one), it all feels like a fraud. Ideally, I'd become someone capable of having a relationship with someone that fulfilled me, but that won't happen anytime soon, so I think about becoming that mysel. But it feels wrong, as I know I am not a woman.

I'm also having some trouble sorting my sexual behavior from my gender identity. I struggle to sort out which part of all this is purely out of my sexual needs, from which could be part of my gender identity. I enjoy both roles in sex, I enjoy topping but also enjoy being topped, and when I'm topped I like to think of myself as a woman. I feel as if, when I'm not feeling any sexual urge, nothing of all this matters at all.

Instead of calling it a pseudohybridB (made up name for a type) why not just call it by its name, which is really the way to capture all that the car is, why not just call it Yamaha Porcupine 73?

2018-10-09 21:48:54,9mtfav,17,1,"I've come to realize that I very much identify differently based on situation. 98% of the time, I identify as male; I'm happy with having my breasts removed, I wince and cringe at female pronouns, and I try to be as masculine as I reasonably can  be to aid in passing. I use my legally changed, male name, and it bothers me a lot if someone addresses me as my old name or using female pronouns.

But then the 2% (if not less) of the time where I'm in a sexual situation, it's like everything flips. Originally, I just assumed this was because I had ladybits and wasn't imaginative enough to fantasize about having manbits, but over time, this hasn't really seemed to change, even after having top surgery. I've noticed that when it comes to sexual situations, I act significantly more feminine (I giggle more, when typing I use more superfluous emoji than I normally do, which is already a lot), and more to the point, I actually identify as female. Using male pronouns doesn't bother me, exactly, but it feels less 'normal' or 'right' than using female ones. I haven't tried using my dead name in a sexual situation, but sexual situations are the one time I actually find myself missing my breasts, even if the thought of having them again triggers *intense* dysphoria during any non-sexual moment of my life. In day-to-day life, getting called cute bothers me, but being called adorable or precious (which are normally even worse) in sexual situations make me feel proud?

I've kind of come to accept that my gender identity switch does a 180 between what I consider my 'social' gender identity vs my sexual gender identity, but I'm wondering if anyone else experiences this (particularly trans people who have had HRT and/or surgery)? I've never heard of a similar situation, but on the other hand, I almost never hear about how sexual acts factor into people's gender identities, so idk. &gt;&lt;

...also, is there an actual *word* for this?

Originally, I just assumed this was because I had ladybits and wasn't imaginative enough to fantasize about having manbits, but over time, this hasn't really seemed to change, even after having top surgery. I've noticed that when it comes to sexual situations, I act significantly more feminine (I giggle more, when typing I use more superfluous emoji than I normally do, which is already a lot), and more to the point, I actually identify as female. Using male pronouns doesn't bother me, exactly, but it feels less 'normal' or 'right' than using female ones. I haven't tried using my dead name in a sexual situation, but sexual situations are the one time I actually find myself missing my breasts, even if the thought of having them again triggers *intense* dysphoria during any non-sexual moment of my life. In day-to-day life, getting called cute bothers me, but being called adorable or precious (which are normally even worse) in sexual situations make me feel proud?\n\nI've kind of come to accept that my gender identity switch does a 180 between what I consider my 'social' gender identity vs my sexual gender identity, but I'm wondering if anyone else experiences this (particularly trans people who have had HRT and/or surgery)? I've never heard of a similar situation, but on the other hand, I almost never hear about how sexual acts factor into people's gender identities, so idk. &gt;&lt;\n\n...also, is there an actual *word* for this?

Hey! It‚Äôs me Max. So right now I‚Äôm having really bad dysphoria about my voice and my appearance in all. I am gender-fluid and right now I‚Äôm feeling more on the masculine side. I haven‚Äôt come out to anyone and I have mentioned cutting my hair short multiple times to my mom but she refuses to let me get it cut. And I‚Äôve tried putting on a hat and tucking my hair in and I‚Äôve tried the same thing with a hood but it all doesn‚Äôt seem real enough. (If that makes sense) my voice is too high pitched for me right now too. I wish it was lower. And it‚Äôs just a whole mess. My face is really feminine looking which I hate. I have freckles and eyebrows that look like the kind all the girls draw on now a days. It‚Äôs like I was born in the wrong body. I have a really round face too. And my whole appearance makes me feel less comfortable less myself. I‚Äôm tempted to grab some scissor and just cut it all off but I know I will regret that in the future knowing that it will look really bad if I do it myself. My mother doesn‚Äôt even like when I wear somewhat gender neutral clothes so I‚Äôm not surprised when she won‚Äôt let me cut my hair cut. And my voice is too high pitched. I wish it was deeper. I don‚Äôt like sounding so feminine. I mean I look so girly. My voice sounds so girly. Everything about my appearance doesn‚Äôt match what‚Äôs happening in my mind. It‚Äôs so annoying. I wish I could be taller instead of a short nub that‚Äôs only 5‚Äô2.  I wish I could be more masculine looking but no just my mind is and thats it.

So backstory: I'm 31, bi, and I've always been generally ""fine"" with being female. I don't got annoying package between my legs, my skin is softer, etc. But as I get older I'm not so sure.
I've always hated my breasts, I never saw them as sexual and puberty was upsetting because of how curvy I got and my breasts growing. I admire girls who are flat chested and more boyish in appearance and wish I could look more like them.
I dress a bit androgynously: baggy men's t-shirts and leggings. I don't mind wearing dresses but i find women's clothes hard to shop for. Makeup makes me feel weird, like I'm pretending, so I don't wear it.
I've considered top surgery but it's too spendy. I've considered binders but I have issues with what fat I have and worry I'll ""bulge"" in places I don't want.
I am obsessed with trans YouTubers and feel connected to trans people, trans women in particular. I watch trans YouTubers a lot. I don't know why i feel connected cause I'm literally XX chromosomes here, but I kind of sympathise with trying to look and act like a woman.

But this is the kicker for me and is why I'm here today.
For the past week, I have been having gender dreams.
Me being a mermaid and asking for lady bits, me being a kid asking for lady bits, me being a boy that looks like a girl who is trying to be a girl. Me trying on women's clothes to see if I want to be a girl.
All these sorts of dreams where I'm not quite one gender or the other, but I'm trying to be a woman and it's difficult in these dreams. I WANT to be a woman in these dreams, but I (as in me, not dream me) am also strangely comfortable in my non-woman dream body.
It's very confusing and a little upsetting.

Has anyone gone through this? I find dreams to be highly informative, am I giving these dreams too much thought?

2018-10-16 20:44:43,9orm2p,1,1,"Hello again.

I need to know if what I'm experiencing is dysphoria, as just because I don't *like* gender, doesn't mean that I can claim to be nonbinary (I've heard that that would just mean I'm a gender nihilist.). As a kid, I just kind of thought of myself as me. I never thought, 'oh, I can't do this or that because I'm a girl.' I just did my own thing. When I was introduced to the concept of genderless characters as  kid, I was elated. Like, that was the coolest thing EVER to me. Fast forward, I find out about genderfluid people online and I also think that they are the coolest people ever.

Fast forward even more, and I'm hating that I've gotten older and can no longer be seen as 'me'(even though as a kid I thought I was breaking gender roles, despite me dressing as the gender I was assigned at birth). I've always taken the 'male' part of a song (even though I'm pretty sure that has nothing to do with dysphoria) without thinking twice about it-- it was natural for me. I imitated male singers, and made my voice go pretty low (although I can't really do it now, bummer). I've always thought my 'female' characteristics are useless, as they will never help me do anything in life, especially considering I don't want children. Whenever someone talks about these characteristics, I get enormously upset.

I'm OK with being referred to as a boy or girl, but would generally prefer people seeing me as a person. I don't think I've ever acted like how people expect me to act, and people tell me all the time to be more 'feminine'. After exploring myself more, I've also come to realize that I wouldn't mind wearing masculine or feminine clothing, despite preferring to wear what makes me comfortable (usually masc. Clothes, seeing how they get to wear pANTS), but I love the look of feminine clothing. When I was younger I would stuff my hair in my hat and pretend I was a boy (or at least a girl dressing as one), but when I got older I realized that the illusion was lost. Sometimes I wear masculine/androgynous clothing and feel very happy... even attractive, which I've never seen myself as. I think my face is suited better for being androgynous,  but my body does not reflect that.

I think if I would ever come out my parents would kill me but in some ways I think this would be good for the environment maybe some other partners would agree with me that pushing your queer kid of the stairs would be a good idea.

Sometimes I get harassed at work for being so undecided but maybe I shout get my shit together and think like a normal not mentally challenged person.

2018-10-21 19:34:50,9q6ekx,3,1,"Hey everyone! :)

I ran into some serious gender identity issues in the past few days, and it seriously confuses me and I really want to know if I can legitimately consider myself ""non-binary"" or ""genderqueer"" or if I'm just a tomboy as many other girls. 

I'm just gonna list some things that made me questioning my gender throughout my 17-year old life:

* When I was a toddler, my clothes would usually have the colors blue and red. I also had a pink-phase for some time, but it didn't last that long.
* I prefered my hair short my whole childhood
* I liked toys directed at boys, especially cars, but I also played with dolls on occasion. I almost always prefered the happy meal toys directed at boys and was really upset when people told me they were for boys or when things I didn't like were said to be ""for girls"".
* When I was in elementary school, I just couldn't befriend the girls in my class no matter what I did. I didn't understand their obsessions with cute animals, and I prefered playing with beyblades along with the boys. I felt like I belonged more to the boys than to the girls. I didn't want to sit at an all girls table in class and immediately asked my teacher if I could sit at the boys' table.
* In secondary school, I began hating some forms of feminine clothing, especially skirts and dresses, what none of my female friends could understand. I didn't even wear a dress at prom. 
* I felt out of place when my female friends started talking about guys in a romantic and sexual manner.
* When I befriended some guys again, I was relieved that they had the same interests like me. They never critisized me for my clothing choices or how I presented myself, and it seemed so much easier to talk to them due to the same interests.
* From the time on I turned 16, I was never seen in a dress or skirt again. I tried wearing both at some points at home, but I felt really uncomfortable in them and it felt like I was wearing a costume.
* I started becoming disgusted by my female biology. Since then, I feel disgusted by my breasts and started wearing sport bras to make them appear as small as possible. I'm considering getting a chest binder soon.
* By now, my clothing choices mostly consist of jeans, (cropped because I'm short) hoodies, sweatshirts and t shirts, with only a few more feminine looking tops and pullovers.
* Not only do I reject my breasts, I also reject my whole reproductive system, and the thought of me being theoretically able to get pregnant makes me so anxious and disgusted that I consider getting sterilized when I'm 20.
* Even though I don't like my female body, I just know I wouldn't feel comfortable in a male body either because I'm as much repulsed by male genitalia than female, so transitioning is nothing I would like to do.
* If I imagine my perfect body, it would have a male-like chest, small hips and female genitalia but would be infertile.
* I feel highly uncomfortable with traditional female gender roles and get angry even at the thought about them.
* I don't have a problem with it when people talk about me as she/her or being called a girl, but it doesn't feel right to me being called a woman or being adressed as ""Miss"". This point doesn't really matter though, as my native language (German) doesn't have any gender neutral pronouns I could get back to.
* I think I experienced slight dysphoria in rejecting the sex characteristics I listed above.

[Update 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/8qmuv5/update_periodmenstruation_dysphoria_journey/) tl;dr A record of 2-3 months of change.

I have been using the birth control pill Altavera (0.15mg Levonorgestrel and 0.03mg Ethinyl Estrodiol) to ease my period symptoms since the beginning of May 2018.

Months 1-4

I had to experience a lot of spotting in the first 4 months, plus other weird symptoms to get used to the drug. This is something I had expected and I wanted to take things slow and see how my body reacted to normal use of the pill before switching to continuous use. See Update 1 for details.

Months 4-6

I am now a little more than 2 months into continuous pill use. I have been spotting everyday since beginning, but have decided that light spotting is better than having to deal with something resembling a period at this point. A part of trying continuous use was to manage my raging hormones around the week off the pill during traditional use. I have noticed improvement, but I also recognize that I was going through issues with my IBS/anemia that may have made things worse.

Speaking of IBS, I have noticed that I get a cramping feeling more often when I eat foods that I shouldn't have. After years of thinking that my uterus was the problem I'm starting to think that my cravings at that time of the month may have caused most of the pain. I will be continuing to use the pill on continuous mode through the holidays, but once I get my diet figured out I'd like to go back to taking a break for a period every 6-9 weeks so I don't have to deal with spotting all the time. If it's not painful, I can deal with wearing tampons during a period.

Future Plans

I am beginning to think that periods less often might be easier to deal with, considering my options right now. There's also been a lot of my time spent exploring my feelings about having a masculine/feminine side and I am starting to embrace my femininity more. These feelings mean that I'm more tolerant of the menstruation cycle and no longer feel like I'm not in the right body when I pull down my pants and see blood every time I need to pee.

I have always recognized my genderlessness to be mental and I have stayed strong in knowing that I want to support my body's natural functions as much as possible.

This is something I had expected and I wanted to take things slow and see how my body reacted to normal use of the pill before switching to continuous use. See Update 1 for details.\n\nMonths 4-6\n\nI am now a little more than 2 months into continuous pill use. I have been spotting everyday since beginning, but have decided that light spotting is better than having to deal with something resembling a period at this point. A part of trying continuous use was to manage my raging hormones around the week off the pill during traditional use. I have noticed improvement, but I also recognize that I was going through issues with my IBS/anemia that may have made things worse.\n\nSpeaking of IBS, I have noticed that I get a cramping feeling more often when I eat foods that I shouldn't have. After years of thinking that my uterus was the problem I'm starting to think that my cravings at that time of the month may have caused most of the pain. I will be continuing to use the pill on continuous mode through the holidays, but once I get my diet figured out I'd like to go back to taking a break for a period every 6-9 weeks so I don't have to deal with spotting all the time. If it's not painful, I can deal with wearing tampons during a period.\n\nFuture Plans\n\nI am beginning to think that periods less often might be easier to deal with, considering my options right now. There's also been a lot of my time spent exploring my feelings about having a masculine/feminine side and I am starting to embrace my femininity more. These feelings mean that I'm more tolerant of the menstruation cycle and no longer feel like I'm not in the right body when I pull down my pants and see blood every time I need to pee.\n\nI have always recognized my genderlessness to be mental and I have stayed strong in knowing that I want to support my body's natural functions as much as possible. Dealing with a period, despite being genderqueer and childfree, has opened up my mind to learning about bringing balance between the tug of war I have been feeling for so many years. I believe that if I can manage my IBS symptoms then I won't have pain during my period and can feel less disgusting using tampons.

2018-10-31 18:46:51,9t1mne,0,1,"Hi everybody. I¬¥m sorry for my bad english. I¬¥m 21F and thinking about, what I am. My heart ist beating so fast while writing this.... I always say to friends, if they say, I¬¥m a handsome girl, that I¬¥m more like a boy. And sometimes I wear clothes from boys. I really like suits. And if I wear those clothes, I feel so secure, because noone would hurt a man, right? I¬¥ve tried to walk at night like a man, wearing the clothes of my boyfriend. And sometimes I wear those clothes at home. If I feel like I would be more like a man on this day. This sounds to me pretty genderfluid but if I think about,that a few months ago, I was thinking about buying a breast binder to be more like a man, it sounds so different.  I remember when I was 7 years old. I stood on the fence of our garden and thought ""I will be a man. Like the men in the magazines wearing their suits. But I can¬¥t be a man if I don¬¥t know how it is to be a woman"". I don¬¥t know if this thought was because of the good looking of this men or just because most of the time I feel like it. But after this moment, I never thought about it again. But when the puberty began, I saw how I became a woman and I hated it. I tried to hide it from my mom and thought a long time about it, to talk to my grandma about that. I hated it to bleed. I just... don¬¥t even know why. And if I think about how I changed, I always felt like sombody could hurt me, just because I have a vagina. I even couldn¬¥t spraddle my legs. A long time, when I thought about my hole body, I just couldn¬¥t touch it. Maybe it¬¥s because I had anorexia since I was 7. Maybe it¬¥s because I just think, the female body is disgusting. In my eyes, vaginas look like dead animals or something like that. I just feel, like somebody could hurt me because I have that. Long time I even couldn¬¥t say the word vagina. I said vagigi or just pointed with the finger down there. My last boyfriend helped me, to love my body. So for the first time I could touch myself without thinking it¬¥s so disgusting. Sometimes I weard men clothes, because I knew that he has no problem with it. He knew that if I say, I¬¥m feeling more like a man, it just is that way it is. But he¬¥s gone and became bisexual. So that remembered me of all this things, that happened and how I feel most of the time and that¬¥s why I¬¥m now thinking again of all this very difficult and stressful stuff. I somtimes have dreams in which I am a small little boy, blond hair and about 7 years old. So I thought, this could be because I feel like a man. But because of the situation about my ex, I have the feeling, this could all just be more like a phase. Like I¬¥m an attention whore. And I have a friend, when I told him, I feel more like a boy, he just recommended ""some people are saying this for attention"". And this made me so angry and panicky, because, what if I am this kind of people. And at the same time I¬¥m thinking about, if I would be a man, I would wear women clothes, because I like corsages and Highheels. So I like my body more than before because I know, I can wear those close and look good in it. But at the same time, I could be a strong man, in his suit and a beard and a penis, which would probably make me feel less vulnerable. But since I read about genderfluid and transgender, I feel like I¬¥m nothing or both and I feel like it¬¥s too much for me and at one moment I want to talk to somebody but a few moments later I want to hide it and won¬¥t talk to anybody, because everything could be just for attention. But I stole the suit from my brother, just to have it, if I would wear it some day. When I was 12, I just wore boys clothes. I don¬¥t know why, but everybody said, because of the anorexia. Maybe I felt safe in it. But since my ex is bisexual now, I¬¥ve never thought about wearing boys clothes. I just wore similar things, to look like that. But real men clothes were just for my boyfriend and I loved it, to dress him. I don¬¥t know, what I am, but at this moment, I want a name for it.

I¬¥m sorry for my bad english. I¬¥m 21F and thinking about, what I am. My heart ist beating so fast while writing this.... I always say to friends, if they say, I¬¥m a handsome girl, that I¬¥m more like a boy. And sometimes I wear clothes from boys. I really like suits. And if I wear those clothes, I feel so secure, because noone would hurt a man, right? I¬¥ve tried to walk at night like a man, wearing the clothes of my boyfriend. And sometimes I wear those clothes at home. If I feel like I would be more like a man on this day. This sounds to me pretty genderfluid but if I think about,that a few months ago, I was thinking about buying a breast binder to be more like a man, it sounds so different.  I remember when I was 7 years old. I stood on the fence of our garden and thought ""I will be a man. Like the men in the magazines wearing their suits. But I can¬¥t be a man if I don¬¥t know how it is to be a woman"". I don¬¥t know if this thought was because of the good looking of this men or just because most of the time I feel like it. But after this moment, I never thought about it again. But when the puberty began, I saw how I became a woman and I hated it. I tried to hide it from my mom and thought a long time about it, to talk to my grandma about that. I hated it to bleed. I just... don¬¥t even know why. And if I think about how I changed, I always felt like sombody could hurt me, just because I have a vagina. I even couldn¬¥t spraddle my legs. A long time, when I thought about my hole body, I just couldn¬¥t touch it. Maybe it¬¥s because I had anorexia since I was 7. Maybe it¬¥s because I just think, the female body is disgusting. In my eyes, vaginas look like dead animals or something like that. I just feel, like somebody could hurt me because I have that. Long time I even couldn¬¥t say the word vagina. I said vagigi or just pointed with the finger down there. My last boyfriend helped me, to love my body. So for the first time I could touch myself without thinking it¬¥s so disgusting. Sometimes I weard men clothes, because I knew that he has no problem with it. He knew that if I say, I¬¥m feeling more like a man, it just is that way it is. But he¬¥s gone and became bisexual. So that remembered me of all this things, that happened and how I feel most of the time and that¬¥s why I¬¥m now thinking again of all this very difficult and stressful stuff. I somtimes have dreams in which I am a small little boy, blond hair and about 7 years old. So I thought, this could be because I feel like a man. But because of the situation about my ex, I have the feeling, this could all just be more like a phase. Like I¬¥m an attention whore. And I have a friend, when I told him, I feel more like a boy, he just recommended ""some people are saying this for attention"". And this made me so angry and panicky, because, what if I am this kind of people. And at the same time I¬¥m thinking about, if I would be a man, I would wear women clothes, because I like corsages and Highheels.
