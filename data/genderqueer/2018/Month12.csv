I'm renegotiating my salary next week, and I'm pulling up data from a few different sources online. PoCs, LGBTQIA, those with mental and physical disabilities and other minority groups are paid less than cis white men. So, in part, this poll will help me provide some backing for my negotiations-but I'd also like to see those of us that represent oppressed groups have an open discussion about this stuff and hopefully gain a few tools to fight this. 

You do NOT have to tell me how much you make, or even what you do. I'm just looking for how accurate these figures are compared to what you're currently making. These are also (possibly) helpful free tools if you're planning on negotiating too. Just let me know which sites you check out, and give poll responses like this:

L=much lower (lower by 5k)

R=round about ballpark to what you're making now (within 5k)

H=Much higher (higher than 5k)

\-US Department of Labor Statistics : [https://www.bls.gov/](https://www.bls.gov/) 

\-ERI's [salaryexpert.com](https://salaryexpert.com/) search engine (This is the easiest one to get a figure from.) 

\-Payscale: [https://www.payscale.com/](https://www.payscale.com/) 

\-GlassDoor: [https://www.glassdoor.com](https://www.glassdoor.com/) 

Side note: I did a similar survey with pals on Facebook, about 60 responses. From what I was able to gather, those of us in tech in larger cities were getting paid a bit more than the salaryexpert figures, while those in rural/smaller areas were paid less. That site is pretty reputable (from what I understand), and pulls cost of living data and local real estate market prices, things like that. But I'm not sure what else. Thank you if you respond!

2018-12-03 10:38:37,a2nj4m,3,1,"Hi all!

Long post incoming, but there’s a summary at the end ;)

I’m a 33 yr old genderfluid person, something I’ve started to realize about 1.5yr ago. I’m AMAB but have always been quite feminine in my mannerisms, communication style, etc etc, something I’ve been bullied with or have tried to change to conform to expectations for most of my life. 

Anyway, I’m married to a straight girl from a small-town conservative family. She’s still getting used to the fact that I’m expressing myself more femme when I feel like it, but she’s trying to be supportive. Actually, almost everyone I know had been super awesome about it, and apparently my coming out wasn’t much of a surprise to many people (often heard; “it kinda makes sense”).

The exception: my wife’s parents. They live in a small village in a part of the country that’s very homogenous in terms of culture and ethnicity; they even speak a different local language. (Frisian, a minority language in the Netherlands. Fun fact: it’s the language that’s most closely related to English).

So, when I came out last year, they were very concerned about their daughter, and asked her questions and made assumptions like:

-How could she be happy like this?
-I would never be able to find a new job.
-Obviously this meant I didn’t want children.
-Men wearing makeup is disgusting.
-I probably waited until after my dad had passed away because they figured he would’ve had difficulty accepting it. (Actually I know he was secretly into crossdressing, and I would’ve loved to share it with him).

Yeah. Luckily my wife was also like: wtf!? We had some talks with them, and they now see that, while they still don’t understand it, at least I’m still the same person, and my wife is (mostly) happy with me. 

But, of course, the holidays meant visiting them.  Usually I kinda dress in a way that makes me feel confident- whether it’s more masc or femme depends on the situation and my mood, although I prefer looking cute with some makeup, leaning towards feminine. Especially for an occasion such as the holidays I want to feel okay and not dysphoric or anything... 

So, whilst planning stuff for the visit, my wife asked me if I would please present masculine, just wearing trousers and a shirt or jumper, maybe only light makeup -at most-. When I asked why, she explained that she didn’t want her parents to feel awkward, which would also make her feel awkward as a result. She felt quite anxious about it... which I totally get, as I also often struggle with what I feel comfortable with in which situation; and it can be scary to face people who might react negatively to your appearance.

This lead to a discussion and quite an argument in the end though: I explained that, of course, I would dress in a way that I would feel would be okay, but that I wanted to also be able to do what feels okay for me. If I always dress in a way to not make people uncomfortable or confused or whatever, I’d never be able to do what I want (I’ve done that for about 30yrs already- conforming to gender expectations). She countered by saying that everyone plays roles sometimes and dresses appropriately according to a situation- and that it shouldn’t be a big deal to just wear something I often wear. 

To me, it wasn’t so much the actual wearing something more masculine, but in the end, I guess it comes down to acceptance and being able to be myself. In the end I just wore some jeans and a random (masc) T-shirt that I felt okay in, but it did leave a sour taste...

I was wondering if/how others deal with this. It feels kinda shitty that my wife basically asked me to pretend I’m not genderfluid, but I do get where she’s coming from, as she just wanted a fun night with her family without any fuss or awkwardness. Yet, this did mean it made it more difficult for me. I teach classes on gender and sexuality to teens, and I’m aware of the importance of exposure in changing people’s ideas. So if I’m always hiding that part when I’m with them, they’ll never learn and be okay with it...

I hope to give y’all a bunch of bite sized data points and then hope to mine from your probably larger framework of understanding to help me find some direction for my gender identity.

Also please excuse or be understanding of any non pc terminology I might use, I feel like I don’t know all the nuances of it or what terms mean what exactly.

-I was identified male at birth.
-I have been diagnosed as being on the extreme upper end of the gifted spectrum (i.e. profoundly gifted) and gifted people tend to be more “androgynous” (so I discovered and found to be validating), and I am and have been.
-Because I grew up in a religious environment my sexuality has been fairly suppressed throughout my life but as I’ve come out of religion I find clues about it through my turn on’s.
-In general I’ve found the whole “sissy” genre to really resonate, though the term itself does not. I am submissive sexually and I guess sissy stuff would be a fetish, but I am unsure of how that squares with my gender identity on a more holistic level.
-I’ve called myself “bi-flexible,” but I’ve only dated cis women.
-So far the only term that I’ve found that I resonated with was “two spirit” but then I found out that you can only be that if you’re Native American and I’m not sure if I have any of that in my genes.
-I think I resonated with “two spirit” because I am a very spiritual person (to provide some labels/terms: mysticism, non-duality) and feel like the complexity of my sexuality and gender expression and identity stems from my inner wholeness and Self which is actually more “yin” than yang.
-My ideal partner would probably be a more dominant yang energy woman who would appreciate and celebrate me in my more yin/feminine expression and, at times, appearance.
-I can somewhat pass as being both male and female depending on the clothes I wear and how I present.
-Though I’m fairly new to exploring and questioning more about all this, I really relate to everything I’ve seen from Joseph Harwood in terms of expression, energy and appearance.
-I inhabit aspects of both traditional gender stereotypes - e.g. playing sports but being very sensitive and tuned into relationships, being fairly cerebral and intellectual but also heart centered, enjoying video games and art, music etc. These are the things I mean by being androgynous.

I was assigned female at birth and growing up I was always considered a tomboy, and in my teens I started going for a more androgynous/masc look.

Now a days I feel comfortable with my feminine side and express it more when I'm in the mood.

I've gone through some traumatic experiences that put me in therapy and at first my therapist assumed I may hate feminity because of them, but later she discovered and straight up told me that I am genderfluid.

Gender and sexuality weren't things that were really discussed in my home, I was assumed cis and am expected to be straight.

Now I'm taking the time to figure out who I am, so most of the time I feel ambigous genderwise, but I have more masc leaning days and more fem leaning days. 

So if I want people to understand me better should I just say I'm nonbinary? Or should I say I'm genderfluid? Can I say both??

I notice people on the street look at me longer now as if they're trying to determine whether I check the ""man"" or ""woman"" box. The ambiguity is simply delightful to me! Friends and co-workers have remarked on how ""spiffy"" I look since I started experimenting: one even said that I look like Clark Kent :D!

I\'d describe my style as preppy and professorial - I feel so authentic, confident, sexy, and free when I dress as a man. I even bought a chest binder online to smoosh my 36DD boobs (which I\'m wearing in the photo). I\'m so pleased with how it looks and how comfortable it is on my body. I notice people on the street look at me longer now as if they\'re trying to determine whether I check the ""man"" or ""woman"" box. The ambiguity is simply delightful to me! Friends and co-workers have remarked on how ""spiffy"" I look since I started experimenting: one even said that I look like Clark Kent :D! I still feel a bit self-conscious perusing the men\'s section but it  gets easier every time. I\'m having so much fun admiring myself in my new outfits and behaving in ways I felt that I couldn\'t when I present as a woman (e.g. not shying away from taking up more space in my seat on the bus when the guy next to me is manspreading).

As an introduction: I'm a white male in the age of 31, and always identified myself as heterosexual, and never thought, that something even close would hit me.

The thing is, I never agreed about anything with so called ""genderist"", nor do I now, but accidentally I crashed into Riley J. Dennis on the internet. One of his videos was posted on a ""hate"" thread, and I wanted to know what is she talking about. She talks too fast, barely one or two things can be understood by me, but at one point, I got a rather strange turn on. Some seconds later, I noticed my cock was diamonds like never before.... OMG WHAT THE HELL???

At the end of her video, I just sat on my chair before the laptop with an almost exploding boner, and all I wanted was her, to destroy my narrow minded cock with her beauty, and make me lost in her astonishing, brilliant eyes. As I'm writing these rows of text, still feel crazy...

I wish I knew more about her, somehow get in deep contact or relationship, but this has little chance, since I am not in the U.S.

2018-12-08 19:29:17,a4dozv,10,1,"Hi, I hope this is the right place to post this. I've realized a few months ago that I'm probably gender queer, gender-fluid or nonbinary. I'm 23 and AFAB. I'm somehow worried (I think a lot of people are) of using the concept wrongly or appropriating it unlegitimately. I don't know if the feeling of discomfort that I feel towards femininity can actually be considered dysphoria. People around me are pretty open minded (I hang out around the polyam community a lot), so I can tell them about my questionning but I don't know many people I could talk to who actually relate. 

As a kid I've had some very feminine (barbie dolls and princesses) phases, and some phases where all my friends were boys and I wanted to be ""one of the boys"" really bad. I've always been more of an intellectual type, and way too bad at sports to be a tomboy in the usual sense. I'm also very small. My parents did not really discourage me from playing with either ""feminine"" or ""masculine"" toys even though they took for granted that I would like feminine things. (They did not disapprove me when I would wear boy's clothes that I borrowed from my friends occasionally). My mother works in a male dominated field and generaly has positions that are pretty much second-wave feminism. She used to be a bit transphobic (she understood that people might want to dress/behave like any gender they want but did not understand that people would want to modify their body to match that), but she has become more open minded now.

As a teenager, I had a looooot of internalized sexism. I would say that I was not like ""the other girls"" because girls are superficial or cause too much drama (which, as we know, is simply false). I simultaneously wanted boys to consider me one of their own while at the same time wanting them to be sexually/romantically interested in me, which could only happen if I looked feminine enough. So I dressed and looked relatively feminine. I sometime told myself "" I wish I were a man, but I could not become one with this body because I would be way too small and weak to be a man"".

As a young adult (or would that be ""late teens"" in English? like 17 to 20 yo), I've been in a long term abusive relationship with an extremely misogynistic guy. It was very hard to get over all the sexist ideas he had put in my head. I'm also a philosophy student, and philosophy has this tradition of being very male-centered, and I somehow related with that tradition. 

Then I started being interested in feminism, questioning gender roles and identifiying my own internalized sexism. I also became conscious that I was pansexual. I stopped trying to look interesting/attractive to men, because I grew more confident and was able to tell myself that people I was interested in had to be able to deal with who I am. I cut my hair short, I stopped shaving body hair, I started dressing more comfortable. 

Then I started questioning my gender identity. I feel uncomfortable (and maybe dysphoric) when people adress me too feminine compliments (such as telling me I'm pretty), when male partners (esp if they're straight) compliment my body. I feel most of the time uncomfortable about my breasts (I wear undersized sports bras to hide them) and very thankfull that they are not naturally too big. I feel a lot of height dysphoria. I feel small, weak and I feel that if I were to transition to masculinity, I would never pass. I compare myself to my male partners/friends a lot. When I talk to men (esp a group of men), I'm always very aware of how tall they are compared to me. I mostly wear men's clothes but they're always a bit too big and look ""borrowed"". I like when my girlfriend says I'm handsome or uses masculine pronouns (neutral pronouns are hard to use in French, I do use them but she doesn't know how to, and they definitely are not convenient). I don't think I actually want to be a man. I'm very aware that my socialization as a woman is a big part of who I am and I feel like I can't erase that (and don't really want to). I mostly want to be perceived as androgynous I think. Which is hard because I'm tiny. Some days I look at pictures of trans men and I wish I had a beard and a flat chest and other days I feel comfortable considering myself a queer woman and using she/her pronouns. I'm generally always uncomfortable about doing things that are perceived as girly, and I wonder if that's internalized sexism too (I do like these things on other people though). 

TL;DR (and conclusion): I'm worried that by calling myself genderqueer or gender-fluid, or wanting to use neutral pronouns, I'm just appropriating the struggles of people who struggle more than me, or that it's just a new ""post-feminist"" type of internalized sexism. I also don't know if my use of the word ""dysphoria"" is legitimate.

My pants fit wonderfully but are too baggy, my shoes are hand me downs and too big for my feet. At this sub's suggestions, I'm going to try to go thrifting tonight with the help of my roommate, but at this moment I feel hopeless. All that's going through my head is my former friend laughing and telling me I'm butch even on days where I felt femme and beautiful. Am I trying to be something I'm not? But when I try to be more masculine, I feel like a stranger too.

I don't want to be stuck feeling ""between"" two genders, I want to pick one and be happy with it. I want my hair to cooperate and not stick up at wild angles just because it's short. I want to have enough time in the morning to wake up and do my makeup if I'm feeling feminine, or redo my outfit if I don't feel comfortable. I want to have the money to buy a few nice wigs to wear when I want to be a woman, and I want the expertise to do my hair in a masculine way when I want to be a man.

I'm sick of feeling uneasy when I go to the bathroom, or when a partner compliments me or wants to engage sexually with me. The discomfort is just killing me. What am I?! Is androgynous a gender identity all on its own? Will I ever achieve that look?

In general, I think the best advice is to be kind and compassionate to yourself. Cut yourself some slack when things get you down, allow yourself to feel that this is you, that you get to define your feelings and that your feelings are valid. Because they are. Maybe you don't feel that you are reacting in a socially acceptable or 'correct' way, but they are your reactions and your feelings. Take the time to have them before you try to analyse and understand them. Otherwise they become bottled.

Maybe you already have coping strategies, maybe you already have an end-point in mind, maybe you don't. Whatever, research and learn - about the situations you can face and about yourself. Look into how others cope with it. Protect yourself if you have to - so don't do research at work or where others may track what you are doing. But do research. Seek out safe spaces to discuss your feelings on matters.

Maybe doing something that feels affirming will help you out as well. My friend and I created a short documentary film that asks some of these questions to a gender-non-conforming musician and how music and spirituality has played a vital role in their process of dealing with gender dysphoria.

So I'm essentially AMAB and I would say I'm male, because it's not an identity I want to entirely reject. But at the same time...

However when I started becoming more aware of gender identity I began to think that I don't want to limit my identity to being a guy, stereotypically gay or otherwise. And only AFTER the fact has it started to occur to me that maybe some of these things I've felt, like not feeling confortable being called a man or prefering to be grouped with women, could in fact be part of a gender dysphoria that has gone unnoticed until now.

In addition to that, I've had a talk with a friend who also identifies as genderqueer and we shared our experiences about being uncomfortable with our male anatomy. Now, I'm already very uncomfortable with my body because of my looks in general, so I thought it was just regular body dysphoria over being overweight and what not, but in that moment it kind of clicked that if my average weight friend who also identifies as genderqueer experiences the exact same kind of discomfort, it could very well be part of gender dysphoria. And ever since that realization I've started to notice these things even more.

So essentially my question is, are these valid thoughts or am I reading too much into things?

I thought that because I was amab, that this meant that I had to transition to female. I was privileged to have access to hormones and therapy, but now that I'm nearly 2 and a half years into transition I can't ignore the fact that I hate stereotypically ""womanly"" self presentation. I would really stress out about makeup, even though I was good at it. I also hated heels, dresses, and even long hair (but kept it long because I was afraid of being visibly trans). I would normally wear sweaters and jean, and I was lucky that I passed really well as a cis woman, but that's just it, I don't feel like a woman at all. But I feel right in this new body, I'm okay with my breasts and I want to have bottom and facial feminization surgeries in the future.

Depending on occasion I would express one more than the other and the rest of the time just be quite andro. 

However I'm coming to realise that whilst at times I like expressing male and others female I am becoming more uncomfortable with being physically male. Its not to do with having dysphoria about sexual organs, but more - I never think I'll look feminine enough, but equally its more than that? I don't really know how to explain. 

Basically if I had it my way I wish I could have been born female but then present my Genderqueer identity through presenting masculinish most of them time but still be feminine enough to pull off miniskirts, crop tops, dresses ect. without looking like a 6'3 somewhat masculine man in drag (which unless Im doing drag I don't want). Basically think Bex Taylor-Klaus, I wish I could be her. So yeah, mostly this was just to put things into words but if anyone has any help I'd love to know what you say.
