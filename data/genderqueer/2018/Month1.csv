I love my first name, and I love my middle name, and I have been going by them for a few years now - but when you put the two together with my surname, they just don't ""flow"" at all. It sounds weird and wrong. I don't want to change my legal name to something that sounds weird to say. 

I think the problem is that my chosen first and middle names are both one syllable, and my surname is two.

Both chosen names are gender neutral. My first name is a short version of my birth name; my middle name (which I sometimes go by) is a short, gender neutral name that can be lengthened to a masc name or a fem name, so lengthening it to either of them doesn't feel right.

Separately they work as having two different names that I use around different people. Together, they sound weird and disjointed and I hate it. I thought by having one as a first name and one as a middle name, it would be fine, but nope.

Anyways this is very confusing and I don't really know what to do. Not really expecting any advice but if anyone does have any ideas they would be appreciated

For my whole life, I've had issues with my gender identity. In high school and the beginning of college, I identified as a boy and went by the name Johnny. At that time, schools weren't as good with transgender stuff as they are now, so I remained out to only a handful of people (who disrespected my identity anyway) and was fully out online. Without having an online life where my gender was respected, I probably would have succumbed to my depression. During my second year of college, I met a man who became the reason I socially detransitioned, and I started to feel that being a man wasn't what I was meant to be anyway, and went back to using my birth name, but abbreviated. Once that relationship ended, I had to come to terms with the fact that I was gay, in the sense that I was only into women, as relationships with men made me uncomfortable as well for abuse related reasons. But my uncomfortableness with being seen as either a woman or a man remained, the gender issue was still there and it had no solution. 

Then I discovered the concept of a non-binary identity, and it seemed perfect. I could never look ""gender neutral"" in the sense that other people would be confused about my gender (I'm plus sized and I wear my hair long so it would give it away immediately that I'm DFAB) but even if I changed my name to something more gender neutral (I go by Jay now, socially) and encouraged my girlfriend to use more neutral language when discussing me (partner instead of girlfriend, nice instead of beautiful, things of that nature) I would be overall, okay. 

But the fact is, no one accepts me. And it frustrates me. My girlfriend will use my old name and my new name interchangably, I'm not allowed to come out to her parents because her sibling is also (binary) transgender and it would ""confuse them with the name changes"", my mom uses my chosen name condescendingly when she's angry at me and I'm too nervous to even ask about changing my name ""legally"" in the sense that my school would have me on record as Jay and not my birth name. It's just awful a lot of the times and I don't know how I'm going to get through this, what I'm going to do, or who I'm supposed to be. 

I use they/them or she/her pronouns but no one respects them anyway and I don't want to break up with my girlfriend or fight with anyone anymore over respecting what makes me comfortable in a gender sense anymore. 

I'm sure someone out there understands, sort of, what I'm going through, but what can be done in this situation?

I'm AFAB and have been on T for just over 9 months, and I've loved it so far. My mental health is better than it's ever been. I ""pass"" probably 90% of the time as male.

The problem is that my experience of gender fluctuates (it always has, this isn't a surprise). The fluctuation is typically in sync with my weight. So, when I'm losing weight I feel more feminine, and when I'm overweight I feel more masculine (maybe a coping mechanism for weight/body image issues? Also playing into societal standards of beauty).

Now that it's winter break and I have time to breathe again, I've gotten much healthier with my eating and have started to lose weight.

I know that my chest gets a lot smaller when I'm in shape too, and my chest doesn't bother me when I'm skinny. 

Basically, now that I'm healthier I'm questioning my decision to go on T. And it sucks. 

Regardless of my weight and body image issues I know that I'm still genderqueer, and that I won't ever be completely happy being perceived as only male or as only female, because that's not what I am. I just need to find a way to not feel torn between the two.

2018-01-06 14:18:51,7ojgt6,6,3,"Hello, good people!

MAab here, but I've been seriously questioning my gender since my early teens at the latest. I'm 24 now, and wondering what I can do to achieve a more androgynous/feminine body without attracting too much attention. I've been shaving my legs/arms/underarms etc for a while already, so any comments about that are already out in the open in terms of family.

I'm around 12 stone/168 pounds. Pretty average for my age, I think. Problem is, I definitely have a bit of a belly forming. It doesn't drop or anything, but it sticks out. 32 waist jeans are tight and restrictive, and I know that hasn't always been the case. I really like the idea of a flat stomach, so simply upping my clothing size isn't going to fix my problem.

So I'm just wondering if anyone has any advice on how to get into shape. Searching for fitness articles results in too many conflicting ideas. I just want to flatten my stomach and maybe lose a little weight from my upper legs. People say my calfs are quite bulky-looking already, which I think just comes from how I walk. They're just solid/firm when walking, really. Not bulging with muscle.

I've started with sit-ups/crunches and a daily step counter for now, and I'm trying to watch what I eat by swapping out snacks with a few almonds and semi-skimmed milk with soya/almond milk instead. In terms of drinks, water, tea, coffee and chamomile (with or with spearmint) is basically all I've drank for years now, and the new milk choices are going in coffee and scrambled egg mixtures for the most part. 

That's the best I could understand from all the articles. I don't want to gain muscle at all, really. Especially not in ways that would appear masculine (shoulders etc), so any tips on simply slimming down would be great!

Then I do want to ask about mild HRT stuff. There's 0 chance I'll be going to a doctor about all this stuff, but I've heard some people being happy with self-medicating on low doses of things. I want to avoid breast development if possible, but the weight distribution and skin aspects sound desirable. 

Any advice/experience here would be really appreciated!

2018-01-10 17:40:02,7ph7c4,2,8,"I'm biologically a straight man. I grew up before the word *genderqueer* was coined or gender fluidity had a well-developed subculture associated with it. I've known my whole life that I have an unusually well-developed feminine side. I've usually described myself as ""right in the middle of the gender spectrum"" or ""not fully male"" with the few people I've been able to get very personal with. Interestingly enough, I've found that having well developed feminine and masculine sides to my personality has been a real asset to being a father.  I enjoy the challenge of being self-employed, but also of being a loving homemaker. I enjoy the system-analytical challenge of running a household, but am also very good with the communicative aspects of this, such as letting my wife and kids know exactly how I feel, as well as recognizing and validating their feelings. I have a caring and nurturing side that shows whenever I'm with my children (or really anyone in need of a human connection, particularly lonely older people). People usually describe me as ""gentle"".  I've seen more typical ""guys' guys"" struggle with some of these aspects of fatherhood, and it's those kinds of moments that made me happy I embraced my feminine side.

The only thing I worry about is not being able to prepare my son for a world where winning and results matter, power dynamics are unequal, and feelings are not directly spoken about. These are things I struggled with, and still do when I am forced into male-dominated social arenas.

I enjoy the challenge of being self-employed, but also of being a loving homemaker. I enjoy the system-analytical challenge of running a household, but am also very good with the communicative aspects of this, such as letting my wife and kids know exactly how I feel, as well as recognizing and validating their feelings. I have a caring and nurturing side that shows whenever I\'m with my children (or really anyone in need of a human connection, particularly lonely older people). People usually describe me as ""gentle"".  I\'ve seen more typical ""guys\' guys"" struggle with some of these aspects of fatherhood, and it\'s those kinds of moments that made me happy I embraced my feminine side.\n\nThe only thing I worry about is not being able to prepare my son for a world where winning and results matter, power dynamics are unequal, and feelings are not directly spoken about.

Because of my longstanding insecurities that don't really relate to gender identity, I have trouble figuring out what's a dysphoria thing and what's a self-esteem thing. I've always disliked my short and curvy body, but a lot of that hatred seems to connect with a longing to be tall and toned like the boys. Although my soprano voice is handy for show tunes, I've always wished I could sing and talk at a much lower pitch. 

It's been causing some problems lately. My difficulty telling the difference between body issues and dysphoria is making me doubt my identity, and I've been feeling a lot less secure in who I am now that I've been thinking it over. Has anyone else experienced something similar? Any strategies or advice to help figure things out?

I got really upset with him for this comment because it's hurtful and for also misgendering any non-binary person I've heard him talk about, after being asked several times not to. I tried to confront him about how this makes his art project hypocritical and how it is generally problematic because it's appropriating a community he isn't a part of, one he doesn't fully understand and  one I have witnessed him disrespecting. Not to mention all the other reasons it could be seen as problematic. He deflected all of my arguments with ""I respect your opinion but you are misunderstanding me"" and would not have a discussion with me  to clarify how I was misunderstanding the situation. So I commented on one of his FB posts publicly and civilly about why I think it's an insensitive art project but did not out what he had said, then his friends ganged up on me, when I did finally try to end the discussion with quoting what he said to me in private, the comment was deleted and I was blocked. Which feels like proof to me what he said and what he is is doing is wrong.

But am I crazy? Am I being over sensitive? Obviously there is a lot more to the story which I am willing to share and explain. I also have screen shots of the way I was responded to by his friends, and people in the queer Portland community publicly.

What I did is i searched out a local OBGYN that is trans friendly, explained that I'm NB and therefore not sure if i should pursue a hysto from a cis angle or a trans angle. With that info, she had me get some screenings (so cis angle) and, while there isn't anything super crazy bad going on, there's enough that my insurance gave the go ahead.

I'm so happy. I can't wait. I'm telling ppl at my work and they keep saying ""im sorry"" and I am so fast to say ""I'm not!"".

Anyway, something of note is that I've always avoided stuff dealing with my reproductive junk. But getting tested/ready for this surgery has opened a can of dysphoria I didn't know i had. It's like, when people are all up in your business, avoidance isn't an option. So that's been difficult over the last week, but at least I'm in a place where I can start to deal with it.

2018-01-24 04:46:01,7skrm2,22,3,"This sub probably gets posts like this all the time so I apologize for the repetition.

I'm 23 years old and have been identifying as male for my whole life. However, some things have lately been making me wonder if I might be more comfortable calling myself genderqueer/non-binary. I'll just list them below

- Sometimes I really wish I was a woman. Sometimes, I really wish I was something between a man and a woman. Sometimes, I'm OK with being an effeminate man.

- Being referred to as a man sometimes feels wrong to me, but I'm not sure why. The times I've been called a lady, or ma'am felt weird too, but that might just be because I was not used to it.

- I seem to be indifferent to pronouns. Probably 98% of the time I get 'he', but the few times I got 'she' it didn't feel any better or worse. No one has referred to me as 'they'.

- I sometimes fantasize about being a woman or something that isn't male or female. The fantasies are often just somewhat mundane social interactions, but are sometimes sexual. I definitely would not consider it to be just a fetish.

- Certain features of my body that are associated with masculinity often make me feel really self-conscious. I hate how hairy my arms, legs and chest are. I don't like my Adam's apple. I hate how angular and bony my body is in general. Sometimes, I hate my facial hair. Other times, I'm completely OK with some facial hair and actually let a few days of stubble grow out. Is this a mild form of gender dysphoria? I'm not exactly sure I understand what dysphoria is.

- Being in male-dominated spaces makes me feel out of place, as does being talked to as if I were ""one of the guys"". This part is very hard to describe.

- I already break a lot of (most?) male gender expectations/stereotypes.

- I have already adopted a slightly androgynous appearance even though it was not my aim. Enough to rarely get called ma'am or a lady or get she/her pronouns (at least until I speak).

- My girlfriend once put makeup on me, fixed my hair into a more feminine style, and gave me one of her dresses to wear. It was just for fun, but I think I liked how I looked.

Does it sound like I'm genderqueer/non-binary? Part of me keeps repeating that I'm just an effeminate man, but that starts to sound silly if I re-read some of the stuff I just wrote. Part of me wonders if I might be a trans woman that hasn't fully accepted herself, but I don't always want to be a woman. Sometimes I think this is all just me trying to avoid being seen as a man, because I have a somewhat negative view of men in general. Part of me wishes gender didn't exist and no one had to be anything.

If I do want to start identifying as genderqueer/non-binary, how do I even begin? I feel like it would be weird to just pick a day and say that I'm no longer male, but maybe in a way that already happened years ago.

If you've read my ramblings up to this point, thank you! I suppose in the end it's up to me to decide, but advice would be greatly appreciated! I've been losing sleep and falling behind on classes over this.

I don't think I'd care if I looked like a slightly feminine boy, but looking like a boyish girl is uncomfortable. If that makes sense.
