2018-05-02 00:36:41,8gdc26,8,25,"I'm AMAB and I often wear feminine outfits, including feminine tops like dresses or fitted shirts. One problem I have is that when I wear fitted women's clothes, my nipples show through. Sometimes I don't like this just because I don't like how it looks, and sometimes I also don't like it because it's a visual thing that clearly shows that I have small nipples (a male sex characteristic) and that I am not wearing a bra (a male cultural gender signal).

I've been thinking of the idea of wearing a sports bra to address both the nipple issue, and I wouldn't mind people noticing that I'm wearing a bra because that would send another ""not male"" gender signal.

I have tried on other bras and I don't like them -- they actually give me an appearance of *too much boob* and it looks unnatural to me. I rather like my chest as-is, I have more shape than you'd expect for someone as skinny as I am, and when I wear feminine fitted shirts or the right dress it makes my form look pretty in-between.

So I don't really want to add much, but I also don't want much flattening.
 
I'm curious if anyone has tried this, and if so, what tips you'd have.

Did you have any trouble finding anything that fit reasonably to achieve the sort of effects I want?

2018-05-02 12:37:07,8gh2aw,39,80,"Okay, I know this is a real question (and honestly one I feel a little pushed into asking) so let me explain real quick first. 

Over the last year, I had Avascular Necrosis and was put in a wheelchair while going through a couple intense surgeries. While I was in the hospital, my parents refused to visit (they'd been mad at me for living with some trans friends) so I decided fuck it, I'm going to come out.

My parents and basically my entire extended family disowned me. I went through a lot of this medical stuff alone, with the exceptions of a couple close friends, and things have been rough for a year. I've lost friends from coming out, life is WAY different shifting from passibly straight to visibly queer. 

Anyway, the other day a friend of mine kind of snapped on me that she takes it very personally that I think I'm having a rough time, and I've been sad about it. She gave me this really long speech where she outright said ""I have been through worse than you, my life is harder than yours is"" because she had a major surgery when she was a teenager and also came out as bisexual as a teenager. 

I kind of feel like a lot of this is out of line. I don't think trauma should be a dick-measuring competition in the first place.  Ever since I've known her (and as far as I know, always) she exclusively dates men. And I don't want to invalidate her experiences, but I also think it's very easy for her to be straight-passing and I think she doesn't understand what this transition has been like. I don't know how I'm supposed to feel about this, but it doesn't feel right.

Anyway, as of late I've been thinking about my identity. Growing up, I always had a sort of feminine side and a sort of masculine side. All my best friends were girls, and I loved letting them do my makeup, which I couldn't do myself due to my blindness. But I also loved, and still love, doing martial arts, shooting guns, and singing heavy metal music—traditionally ""masculine"" things, supposedly. Anyway, I'm really into the idea of exploring my gender identity, but I have no idea how to start. So far, I've just been doing things that make me happy—painting my nails, piercing my ears, and buying some cute skirts that I still haven't had the courage to wear outside. Pretty much the only time I've managed to explore my desire to dress in feminine attire is by way of cosplaying at a local Sailor Moon convention.

Since then I've begun working in getting in shape, which has gone really well. I've lost lots of weight and looking a lot better since accepting myself. My health is doing really awesome actually.

Yesterday was the big day. Scheduled consultation with the most trans friendly surgeon I could find in the Chicago area.

He seemed way to overly skeptical about me being genderqueer/non-binary as I don't look ""feminine enough""(which the part the pains me very deeply is what I was seeing him about fixing) and the entire concept seemed utterly foreign to him.

He began going on about how I would need a therapist etc to sign off on this first. And then when he found out I had that already he began going on about how I still need to loose more weight, picking some numbers with out even bothering to inquire about how much I weight, my health, or anything.

I am just feeling really depressed and sad. Been crying on and off for nearly the last 24 hours now.

I am tired of the pain of my brain telling me my chest is not right and there are bits missing. I am tired of being purely male.

Wearing falsies does not help. Just makes it more painful. It serves as a reminder of what is missing.

Then to make stuff worse. United fellates fetid donkey dong. Finding a kink/poly friendly person in network is really problematic when it comes to LGBT therapists. Mine is out of network, meaning I unfortunately can't see her to often.

was completely out as nonbinary, they/them pronouns, name change, androgynous clothes, binder, etc, for two years. Then I moved back to my home red state and got a ""temporary"" job at a preschool. I went back to presenting as a woman for this job. Then I realized how much I loved the job. After a year I realized I wanted to pursue early childhood education, and then started a horrible internal gender conflict. 

First I just tried to not think about it. Then I actually tried to see if I could ""go back"" to being cis (lol). Like forget what it felt like to be out and proud. This was weird for my parents because it had been hard for them to accept me being nb, although they were supportive. I was like ""I have to be in the closet for work. Maybe I can live this way forever. Gender is fake/performative anyway."" 

Well, one year of doublethink and I had a big come to jesus moment. No matter how hard I tried I couldn't ""make"" myself cis. I was able to squelch dysphoria some and reconnect with woman-ness. I no longer cringe at being seen as a woman, she/her pronouns, and feel like I do have a place in women's spaces. BUT the truth never goes away. It's like a rock in my shoe. I really am nonbinary and wishing it away doesn't change anything. Even if I didn't know being nonbinary was an ""option"" I'd feel this way and not have a name for it. 

But I want to teach young children. I al going back to school in the fall for an ECED degree and hopefully I'll teach kindergarten or first grade. Trans teachers, especially in lower grades, don't fare so well. Especially in my state. I don't want to be the one to fight that battle either. It's easier to stay in the closet, even though I feel like a traitor and a liar. 

I guess the best term for me right now is ""nonbinary woman"" or ""agender woman,"" because as I read once somewhere, ""my gender is nonbinary, my social class is woman."" I still feel weird and horrible about it though. I'm basically choosing my career over my gender identity. And the mental logistics... how is this going to affect me in the future? What about dating? I don't trust cis men... what if I go into a wlw space and then later have to say ""I'm NB but in the closet forever,"" will I look like a liar?

So after avoiding it the entire shift I was called in to take measurements to get an official uniform [ the uniforms are custom suits, I still hadn't gotten mine yet] and I managed to ask my manager how they felt about gender and expression and. the result was good?

all fine and dandy, right, but now today I have to explain a little more since I felt like my body was imploding one molecule at a time from how tense I was and I. might have hightailed it out of there since I brought it up after my shift ended without elaborating at all.

I'm AMAB, somewhere between genderqueer, nonconforming, genderfluid, nonbinary at this point...really still exploring my identity/expression but I've always had a thing for ""feminine"" stuff. As I've gotten to be more comfortable with my \(still questioning\) self I've gotten more and more confident shopping as guy in the women's section for myself.

I had tried to find information on David's LGBTQ\+ openness on Reddit and Google but wasn't able to find much, so I hope this will appear when the next person like me looks for information like this. Sorry in advance if it's a little long, but this was a great experience and I want to share everything I can to help someone else out down the road!

Friday, I took a mental health day from work and decided to try something I've always wanted to do \- try on wedding dresses! I'll also say I did feel \*slightly\* guilty making an appointment and lying about being engaged and planning a wedding but I'm sure tons of people go for a fitting and never buy a dress so in the end it didn't bother me too much. I looked at the appointment times online before calling to make an appointment to make sure the staff knew I am a guy and the bridal appointment was for me and that it wouldn't be a problem and the woman on the phone was so calm and just brushed it off saying it wasn't an issue at all and my appointment was all set. Phew \- first hurdle jumped.

So when I get to the store, I check in and the girl at the desk takes me to the racks of dresses they have in the store, asked me if I had any ideas or visions and I said no not really, that I was trying to decide between a tux or a dress and I wanted to just try a bunch and see how it went. So I picked out a few dresses to try and she introduced me to the stylist, Alex, who was so sweet and helpful and who treated me just like any other customer. She hooked the back of the sample longline bra for me \(I wasn't planning on that, but she said they recommend it because it helps the dress fit better\) and obviously helped me in and out of all the dresses, talking about their fit, design, what makes them unique, and on and on.

It was one of the best experiences I've ever had! When I stepped out of the room and in front of the mirror in a beautiful ball gown my face lit up and so did Alex's! Other store employees walked by and commented how beautiful the dress was and they looked genuinely happy that I was there and enjoying myself. There were a few other customers in the store too which made me a little anxious, but even one of them said they loved one of the dresses I had one \- and it didn't even seem to phase anyone that I was obviously a guy. Alex even got me to twirl in one of the dresses because she said it looked so pretty when it twirled. Just thinking about this makes me giddy all over again lol!

It was so amazing to be able to just indulge myself and enjoy this ""rite of female passage"" that I never thought I'd be able to experience for myself. The supportiveness of the staff and their non\-chalant\-ness about a dude coming in to try on bridal gowns was such a huge experience for me and definitely helped me build confidence about expressing myself in more traditionally feminine ways.

She was super chill about it. It took her a second to reorient when I first said I was genderqueer and wanted to use they/them pronouns and change my name. She looked a little surprised. Lol. But then she was calling me by my chosen name and pronouns throughout the whole one on one meeting. And she said she'd avoid calling me any name in the office until I officially come out. She going to help me talk with our mutual boss about me coming out too, to give him a heads up before I come out to everyone else.

We have a lot of Allies in the office (work on a college campus), but some of them have never been through Allies training, and for some of them it's been a while and I'm not sure they had genderqueer in it back them. So I'm still nervous about coming out in the office at large, especially concerning some of my older coworkers, but I know my supervisor has my back, which is all kinds of awesome.

This is both a big weight of my shoulders because now it's out there and I can be me at work, but it's also kind of terrifying because I've started the wheels turning on coming out in the public sphere and so many people are going to know that I'm not going to have control over it anymore. This is so different from coming out as asexual or panromantic. This is a whole other beast. But I am so glad I am doing it.

Quick summary \- I'm looking for ways to get confidence to make forward motion in my journey as well as talk to my husband. I need to know to explain dysphoria better and how to address his worry that I will solely present as or be male.

Background: I'm non\-binary and came to this conclusion two years ago after questioning my gender for a few decades \(way too stressful, do not recommend\). However, I have also been struggling for those two years to figure out how that is expressed. I have some pretty bad dysphoria mainly focused on breasts, voice, hair and period. The last is being taken care of by an IUD. My voice, I've thankfully recently found out that I just need to stop subconsciously raising my pitch around other people to sound more female. Breasts, I'm trying to decide if I just want to do a reduction because it's covered by my insurance and then use a binder/sports bra. Hair is then just a matter convincing myself to go through getting the cut I want to. 

I'm lucky in that there are a reasonable number of GNC/LBGT people where I work so I wouldn't stand out there but I'm struggling against the survival instinct to not draw attention to myself in the wider world. Am I OK taking things as slowly as I am? Do you think it's a mistake to just try jumping in on things like my hair that are easily reversible? 

My husband is someone I'm having problems talking about things with. Do you have any suggestions or resources on discussing dysphoria and being non\-binary? Somehow he is the straightest, most cis, person in my immediate family. I've discussed being non\-binary and my dysphoria with him. The problem is I keep feeling like he doesn't understand them. To start with it feels like he's confusing dysphoria with dysmorphia and tries to reassure me that I look good. Then he's oddly resistant to my desire to have much smaller/non\-existent breasts \(though he's in favor of my breasts getting reduced for my health\) and cutting my hair. He says he's worried about me having balance issues and that I'd be unhappy with the hairstyle I am looking at. I know he's worried that I'm going to be male or fully male presenting because of things he's said even though I've assured him that isn't the case \(I know that things like a voice as deep as my father or brother would also cause dysphoria for example\). Those all add up to me being uncertain I'm doing a good job explaining things.

Other than husband I've only talked about my gender with my brother and his spouse in the immediate family. They're both good with it and his spouse is masculine\-leaning non\-binary so it's good to talk with them. I'm actually not worried about talking with the rest of the family because it feels like they basically know but it could make it more awkward to tell them. And I say this because of things like my dad keeps suggesting I look at men's suits or tuxes and my mother telling me her goal was to raise her children in the least gendered way possible.

2018-05-11 09:14:26,8imdam,1,5,"My apologies in advance for a very long winded post, but here goes.

I came out back in 2011 and spent a lot of the time since then completely out. My family and friends are generally very supportive, which has made the process a lot easier. After I moved back home from college in 2016 I started having more trouble. While the area I live in is generally very progressive, it's not nearly as progressive as where I went to college. In addition I started teaching full time. In some ways, teachers can be very progressive, but culturally, the teaching field can be very culturally conservative and I have not been comfortable coming out to my colleagues. On top of that I recently moved in with a few strangers, and because I don't know anything about them or their background, I don't feel comfortable telling them the truth about my identity.

All this to say that I haven't been nearly as open about my pronouns/identity in the last couple years. 

I also work in theater, and generally I tend to be a little more vocal about pronoun preferences in those circles. In my initial emails to casts/designers/directors I almost always mention my pronouns, and I generally try to correct people when they get it wrong. On the most recent show that I worked on I noticed that slipping. 

I came into the process really late, after opening night in fact. I didn't know anyone in the cast and I guess I didn't want to make waves. I did have my pronouns in the signature of my initial email, and corrected a couple of actors on pronouns at first, but after a while I stopped. It seemed like not enough actors knew or cared and I was so exhausted from working two jobs that I almost didn't even have the energy to be upset? It wasn't like it didn't bother me, but I felt completely numb to my frustration.

On closing night I was talking to one of the actors and he approached me to apologize for misgendering me and using the wrong pronouns. He pointed out that he shouldn't have assumed my pronouns without asking me. What surprised me was that I found myself minimizing my frustration, both to myself and to him. At the time it didn't seem like a huge deal, but now I can't stop thinking about it. It made me wonder when I'd stopped standing up for myself, and it disturbed me to realize just how far back into the closet I've gone in the last year. I know I have the right to having people use the right pronouns\(at least cerebrally I know\), but at some point I stopped expecting it.

I feel like I'm losing myself and it honestly scares me. I don't know how to start being vocal about this stuff again and in the mean time I can feel myself turning inward, being less outgoing, and questioning whether I'm ""really"" genderqueer if my identity isn't acknowledged.

These are just my opinions, they relate to me and I use the terms and words to describe things as I've come to understand them. I recognize that my views are not consistent with most current opinion on the subjects, but I intend no offense and respect the right of others to have come to different conclusions. I just want to discuss these things.

I'm body-dysphoric FtM and gender non-conforming. I personally believe that body-dysphoric trans is a disorder of the mental making system of the brain, akin to BIID, and that this is why transition helps some of us. I believe social issues, specifically gender-binary expression expectations, are the other part of the problem.

My brain tells me that I should have a penis, and not having one causes me distress. I feel like I ""should be"" male, but this is where the issue comes into play. What does it mean to feel male? How do I, as a person born with healthy gynotypical physiology and socialized as female, know what I'm feeling *is* feeling ""male""?

I know that I don't ""feel female""... Or do I? 

How can I quantify these feelings? By what measure am I using to understand male and femaleness? How does a cisperson know they're cis? How much of what I think I feel is merely my brain trying to meet or subvert expectation? 

Feelings are too easily influenced. Things like the button test are almost laughable (if you asked me the button test about, for instance, turning into a vampire or werewolf, I'd probably smash it. That doesn't mean I'm really a vampire or werewolf deep down). Science nor psychology know the where what's and why's about gender and sex, cause or causality, everyone's guessing and the current zeitgeist is to just blindly accept subjective experience as law.

I can't get behind that. I want to be healthy, and authentically myself, but that doesn't mean throw away all outside opinion or critical thought. So in the interest of that, I'm here to ask for input, basically on anything I've said so far, whether you agree, partially agree and disagree, or fully disagree, please weigh in and tell me why you think what you do. Any sources would of course be appreciated, though I'd prefer a medical journal over Wikipedia, I'll take anything you got.

For the past while I've personally done a lot in trying to live better and be better and understand myself and be compassionate. The whole schabang really. Through this, I've really come to understand how restrictive and reductive labels are, just by their very nature. That's just a personal belief of mine based on my own experience, and I was able to prove that to myself by taking off labels as they come up and really benefiting from it. I used to call myself Muslim, but I don't anymore. I still pray and fast and read the Quran, but I don't say I'm Muslim because I don't believe there's one definable cut and dry term for ""Muslim,"" it's too abstract of a concept.

2018-05-14 21:05:43,8jfvr8,2,5,"I have identified as homosexual and cisgender \(AMAB\) for most of my life, but this year, I have realized that strict identification with either binary gender was not a fit for me, and wholly inaccurate in describing me. I've since used the term genderqueer, and feel more authentic and comfortable. 

I still consider myself gay, and do not \(as many NB folks do\) prefer ""androsexual"" or some other inwardly\-genderneutral term for my orientation. This is partially because while I am non\-binary, I still consider myself very male. I don't have a desire for more specific terms like demiboy, or some other NB categorization of heavily\-present male  gender\-neutrality, but this is just how I am.

 Because I identify heavily with my masculine side, and I'm attracted exclusively to other males \(including transmasculine people\), I still use the term gay, and I find it accurate. 

My boyfriend \(who is cis, AMAB, and homosexual\) often reminds me whenever I ask him that my genderqueerness does not affect his adoration for me, which is really nice I guess. I think it may be because, as I said, I am ""mostly"" male, and express this way a lot. 

I guess I am just very self\-conscious about my identity, especially based on internalized comments from people who believe I'm not ""fully"" trans\*. Anyway, I just wanted to know that I'm not alone I suppose, and hoped to get the perspective of people who have been in similar situations. I've heard that forums like these can offer needed support when life gets complex and confusing, so I thought I'd give it a go. Lots of love to all \&lt;3

2018-05-19 16:20:53,8km9mi,10,13,"heyhey! I know you aren't my doctor or psychologist. I also know you can't tell me what gender I have or what my identity is. And writing this I don't know why I'm even writing you. maybe because I just really don't know who I could talk to instead, my family and friends would definitely not understand.

I'm Han/Hannah, afab, therefore offline known as Hannah, online(where no one knows me, like reddit,online games,etc) I'm Han. I'm 19 years old and 4 months ago i started questioning my gender again. 
I went through something similar when I was 15/16 years old. But I didn't know anything about gender, so I never even really started to think properly about it. I started binding (with sports bras because I didn't have anything else), only wore things that are considered masculine, tried to be like my brother (my brother started watching youtube-&gt;shortly after I did as well, he learned skateboard-&gt;I as well wanted to learn that,he started playing computer games-&gt;I did the same; you see the pattern). I ""borrowed"" his clothes which resulted in ""stealing"" them haha
I felt really insecure about myself, felt lonely, a huge black hole inside of me but with school stress and  everything I just didn't even realise those  things. Looking back I feel like that might have been a little depression. 

After that I guess I tried to fit in, wore ""normal"" clothes, still not hyper feminine but not things that made people look at me twice, stopped binding, even went to end of school ball in a dress (i was 18 then)

Now I'm in quite a similar situation in which I was at the age of 15 (19 now). My ""chest dysphoria"" (not even sure it is dysphoria though) has gotten really bad, I even started binding with bandages although I know how bad they are. It was just the only thing that could make me feel a little bit better about myself and make me leave the house these days. also I cut my hair short (finally!!) which I had been wanting to do for the past 4 years but didn't dare to because of negative comments by my mum and hair dresser. 
I really started questioning my gender, got into all the non binary stuff and felt like that was something that might fit. and then obviously I also stumbled upon all the people saying non binary is made up, for special snow flakes, blabla, and all these doubts again made me doubt my identity a lot. I went from labels like agender to trans masc back to just a cis female tomboy. 
one important point I find difficult to talk about is that I experienced a very bad sexual experience. I wouldn't call it abuse yet but I was definitely not happy and really really drunk in that situation. 

I looked up reasons for gender dysphoria and found that sexual abuse is one of them. One thing is, I did bind before that experience, it just got a lot worse afterwards. Isn't it strange that my dysphoria gets worse with my depressive time periods? or are these bad times actually caused by dysphoria?

all that makes me doubt my identity. also I just don't care about pronouns, neutral pronouns don't exist in my mother tongue (or better: they are just really complicated) and they don't make me feel any different. quite recently I got called ""he"" a few rare times, which really made me happy, but ""she"" doesn't make me feel uncomfortable. 

I was high and I saw myself as a granddad for a second. my dysphoria was basically gone in that short moment. it just felt real. 
I got drunk and the opposite happened. every few minutes I had to go to the bathroom, desperately staring at the reflection of my feminine body, trying to hide my chest, in my drunkness pushing it around to make it look smaller (obviously not very effective haha).

Right now my dysphoria is bearable, I just wear baggy clothes and no bra at all and that already helps enough. also I'm comfortable with my name Hannah, although I also like Han which is usually seen as a male name or not connected to any gender at all (although it technically even is a name for everbody)
when I look back at old pictures I don't see myself, sometimesl I'm forced into wearing skirts, which makes me incredibly uncomfortable (usually I can avoid it, thank god) and when I see myself like that it feels like a costume, like a stranger is staring back at me. I feel like that might be my way of dealing with stuff, just seeing it as a costume, not a part of who I am?

In connection to sexuality, I'm bi/pan (depending on your definition of the words). when talking to cis men I often feel uncomfortable because I feel like I'm pushed into the traditional ""woman stereotype"" when talking to a person of any other gender I feel like I can just express who I am without these stupid gender roles that society pushes on us. 

Which makes me question, am I just a cis woman that hates gender roles? Or is there really something wrong with my gender. 

For the last months I've been writing down whether I would consider top surgery or going on testosterone and first I guess I had to get used to the thoughts, for top surgery the answer quite quickly changed to yes definitely, for t I was wondering if I really needed the effects. I guess I would be happier with a slightly deeper voice and maybe a different more masculine facial bone structure, I'm not too sure about facial hair though and feel like I could achieve the voice change with voice training as well. 

Also I'm unsure because of the ""I knew it all my life"" stories and that I was quite happy as a child. I did grow up in quite a gender neutral environment but even in the gendered things I did not feel uncomfortable. I did wear dresses as a child and only when puberty hit and I started growing up I didn't like these things anymore.

It's all just a mess. I can't see a psychotherapist right now because I live abroad for another 3 months and then move back to Germany, I've tried talking to a ton of different people online and it literally has confused me even more most of the time. I just don't know what to do anymore. 
I try to just live without thinking about it, just being myself, but my thoughts always come back to it. Someone just has to consider me a girl/woman and mention it and I'm thinking again. 

I don't even know why I'm writing you all this, maybe you still feel like answering, if not that's perfectly fine. 
Thank you for reading all this mess of thoughts

I also know you can\'t tell me what gender I have or what my identity is. And writing this I don\'t know why I\'m even writing you. maybe because I just really don\'t know who I could talk to instead, my family and friends would definitely not understand.\n\nI\'m Han/Hannah, afab, therefore offline known as Hannah, online(where no one knows me, like reddit,online games,etc) I\'m Han. I\'m 19 years old and 4 months ago i started questioning my gender again. \nI went through something similar when I was 15/16 years old. But I didn\'t know anything about gender, so I never even really started to think properly about it. I started binding (with sports bras because I didn\'t have anything else), only wore things that are considered masculine, tried to be like my brother (my brother started watching youtube-&gt;shortly after I did as well, he learned skateboard-&gt;I as well wanted to learn that,he started playing computer games-&gt;I did the same; you see the pattern). I ""borrowed"" his clothes which resulted in ""stealing"" them haha\nI felt really insecure about myself, felt lonely, a huge black hole inside of me but with school stress and\xa0 everything I just didn\'t even realise those\xa0 things. Looking back I feel like that might have been a little depression. \n\nAfter that I guess I tried to fit in, wore ""normal"" clothes, still not hyper feminine but not things that made people look at me twice, stopped binding, even went to end of school ball in a dress (i was 18 then)\n\nNow I\'m in quite a similar situation in which I was at the age of 15 (19 now). My ""chest dysphoria"" (not even sure it is dysphoria though) has gotten really bad, I even started binding with bandages although I know how bad they are. It was just the only thing that could make me feel a little bit better about myself and make me leave the house these days. also I cut my hair short (finally!!) which I had been wanting to do for the past 4 years but didn\'t dare to because of negative comments by my mum and hair dresser. \nI really started questioning my gender, got into all the non binary stuff and felt like that was something that might fit. and then obviously I also stumbled upon all the people saying non binary is made up, for special snow flakes, blabla, and all these doubts again made me doubt my identity a lot. I went from labels like agender to trans masc back to just a cis female tomboy. \none important point I find difficult to talk about is that I experienced a very bad sexual experience. I wouldn\'t call it abuse yet but I was definitely not happy and really really drunk in that situation. \n\nI looked up reasons for gender dysphoria and found that sexual abuse is one of them. One thing is, I did bind before that experience, it just got a lot worse afterwards. Isn\'t it strange that my dysphoria gets worse with my depressive time periods? or are these bad times actually caused by dysphoria?\n\nall that makes me doubt my identity. also I just don\'t care about pronouns, neutral pronouns don\'t exist in my mother tongue (or better: they are just really complicated) and they don\'t make me feel any different. quite recently I got called ""he"" a few rare times, which really made me happy, but ""she"" doesn\'t make me feel uncomfortable. \n\nI was high and I saw myself as a granddad for a second. my dysphoria was basically gone in that short moment. it just felt real. \nI got drunk and the opposite happened. every few minutes I had to go to the bathroom, desperately staring at the reflection of my feminine body, trying to hide my chest, in my drunkness pushing it around to make it look smaller (obviously not very effective haha).\n\nRight now my dysphoria is bearable, I just wear baggy clothes and no bra at all and that already helps enough. also I\'m comfortable with my name Hannah, although I also like Han which is usually seen as a male name or not connected to any gender at all (although it technically even is a name for everbody)\nwhen I look back at old pictures I don\'t see myself, sometimesl I\'m forced into wearing skirts, which makes me incredibly uncomfortable (usually I can avoid it, thank god) and when I see myself like that it feels like a costume, like a stranger is staring back at me.

How in the world am I supposed to choose a label for my gender!?

I'm afab, but even when I was a kid I knew I didn't fully fit femininity. Mentally, I always thought I was more masculine, and I frequently would get frustrated that my mental state wasn't reflected in my physical state. The past few years I've started embracing my androgynous side much more and I'm totally loving it, but if anyone asked I would still tell them I'm a woman. This bothers me; I don't feel completely female, nor do I feel completely male. Some days I feel differently than others, which makes me think I might be more genderfluid.

Statement: There are more than two genders.

Rebuttal: There are only two.  People are born with either XX chromosomes or XY chromosomes.

Counterargument: No there aren't. Intersex people exist. Some people are not even born with XX or XY Chromosones and some \(Chimeras\) are born with both.

Rebuttal: Those only account for a small part of the population. The vast majority of people who identify as a third gender were born either male or female. They were not born intersex. Calling someone something different doesn't change their biological reality.

Counterargument: Certain people have a certain genotype but their phenotype may present as something else entirely. People with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome for example have XY chromosomes, but everyone by observing them as they go through life would recognize them as female.  


Rebuttal: Again intersex people are a small section of the population. They are biological accidents, outliers to the general rule. Intersex people may call themselves a third gender but people who were born not intersex cannot. They cannot change the fact that they were born male or female.  


Counterargument: Gender refers to the social rules attached to biological sex. There can be nonbinary genders because there are people who don't conform to the social rules attached to either biological sex and don't identify with being either male or female.  


Rebuttal : Gender roles don't exist. I don't conform to gender roles in \_\_\_ , \_\_\_\_, and \_\_\_ way. I know many people who don't conform to gender roles.   


Counterargument: Go down on the street. You will notice that the vast majority of men have shorter than chin\-length hair. You will notice the vast majority of women have longer than chin\-length hair. If you are guy, your chances of success are much lower if you into a finance or law or customer service interview wearing a dress.  Of course gender roles exist. They are everywhere. \(I already feel dragged through the mud here\).  


Rebuttal: Gender roles don't exist. We are all just human. You are just exacerbating a problem by creating more genders when all these artificial rules on gender are bullshit. There are still mainly two biological genders, male and female, with very limited exceptions. Also, the majority of men and women have different hair lengths and clothing options because they want to, not because they are forced to. Clothes and fashion aren't important.  


Counterargument: If you want to go abolish gender roles, go create an organization. All nonbinary people want to do is live their lives in the way they choose. Nonbinary genders help them do live their life and articulate who they are. Nonbinary people don't exist to solve the world's gender problems. If you want to do that, put your skin in the game.

Religion! Spirituality.
Cats, dogs, fishes.
Clothes.

I am engaged, not looking for, not interested in love, or sex, nothing like that.

I only listen to a few female artists music, Tina Turner, Bonnie Tyler.
