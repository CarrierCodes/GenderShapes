I'm mainly posting this to see where other people stand on this. I'm not ACTUALLY inferring that genderfluid people (nor any other NB or GQ identity) are automatically sexually fluidity, but just a general discussion.

Now before I started discovering myself as a genderqueer person, I found myself ID-ing as a gay man, and seeing myself as only attracted to men (eventually also including trans men, which for some reason I didn't factor before). What I've tended to find so far is that, maybe not so much actively finding more people of different genders attractive (because I would be a hypocrite if I said I wouldn't date another GQ person), but when I do see an active attraction to something outside of MY norm (I'm mainly attracted to men, cis trans or, unfortunately, assumed) I don't find myself necessarily defending it as much, or being as rigid in my definitions. Now I suppose it makes sense really, considering not belonging to a binary gender can sort of muddy the gay-straight binary as well (and lets not forget bi folx), but I noticed that I was somewhat more liberated and comfortable, even tho when I initially started ID-ing as GQ it sort of felt like I went into the wilderness again.

\[white genderqueer butch, low-income, 22 yo\]  


\[background\]:  
So I came out as genderqueer a few years back, really felt dysphoric about my chest, went on T for about 8 months (that's what my therapist required for her to give me approval for top surgery), hated the effect T had on my voice (why I stopped), finally got top surgery, and am now feeling genuinely euphoric about my body (apart from my voice, because people constantly mistake me for a guy).

I'm graduating my liberal queer bubble of a college in a couple months, and thinking about sticking around the area (Indiana/Michigan/Ohio) but would definitely wanna stay in another queer bubble of a city if I do that (Grand Rapids, Ann Arbor, South Bend, Cleveland, Columbus, etc.).  


\[issue\]:

Unfortunately, from a lot of the interactions I've had with queers outside of my college, most are pretty rooted in Lesbian/Gay, wlw/mlm mindsets. I'm honestly so afraid that I won't find people who'd wanna date me, or even friends with whom I can relate. I'm such an in-between with gender/sexuality: act like a twink, look like a butch, identify as a gq bi woman, and sound like a 14-yo-boy. I don't get along with trans men (my only experiences with them have been saturated with misogyny/trans-misogyny), cis women typically only use me for emotional labor, and other genderqueer folks are usually too rich or upper-middle class for me to really relate to.

I don't know exactly what I'm asking. I guess I just want to know if this happens with anyone else? Does it get better? Am I being too picky, or setting too high expectations on other queer folks?

So I basically had everything planned out and wanted to ship my gc2b binder to a Hermes post office (""PaketShop"" officially, because otehr services need you to be 18+ while Hermes just doesn't care lol) but then I realized that I have no idea if you can even use that with gc2b.

And then the workers are usually a bit pissed at you too since they won't get their money from it and that's the last thing I want, who knows maybe they'll suddenly make up an excuse to not give me the package unless I come with my parents or something just to be mean, even if they're technically not allowed to.

I think with a different provider, DHL, you have to out in ""Postfiliale""(=post office) as your street, then the number of the post office and all that but is it the same with Hermes and would they know what it means and where exactly to ship it since it's shipping internationally?

  So I've been grappling with the feeling that I present too ""binary"" to ID as genderqueer and to use they/them pronouns.  I would never have these thoughts about others in the same situation but for some reason I'm criticizing myself over it.

  I'm AFAB and have been on T for 4 years, have had top surgery, hysto and stage 1 phallo, and I still absolutely ID as transmasculine genderqueer and strictly use they/them pronouns (other than at work because I'd like to keep my job). But I feel like I'm too ""ftm seeming"" to get to use they/them pronouns.  When I have to have he/him used at work it just feels so wrong and makes me feel disconnected and like I'm not even being talked to.  They/them pronouns are the only ones that feel right and have ever felt right, and I don't consider myself a man.

  I know there's no wrong way to be nonbinary but I'm just feeling anxious about presenting so masculinely and being happy with that yet still in my heart knowing I'm genderqueer.  When people have asked me how I know I'm genderqueer and not a man then I just don't know how to answer.  Because to me it's just, I know what I am, there's no attached explanations in my mind and I can't figure out how to explain how I know.  I'm just comfortable with being genderqueer.  

  Anyone have any insight or opinions to share on this?  Don't know whether I should just not be bothered by people asking that question because I feel what I am or if I should ask myself if maybe they're right and I'm somehow in denial of being male?

2018-11-05 17:59:28,9ufttx,3,1,"One of the more frustrating parts of being queer is that we're all representatives of the culture (whether we want that or not). I'm not the friend who happens to be queer, I'm the queer friend -- or the trans, bi, whatever. I'm the label first and the person second. On one hand it's nice people finally have a script to go off of, so there's fewer blank or surprised reactions coming out. On the other, well -- everyone's got an opinion now. Which is fine except for that ambassador bit I mentioned. Now I'm like the Queer Pope, and I must bless it now.


""Holy Pronoun, Who Art Thou In ... *whatever.*"" Here's the thing -- it seems obvious to say someone doesn't have to be queer to support LGBTQ rights. For some reason though, in the rush to be politically correct the message got marked return to sender; They're not *queer* rights, they're everybody's. 


Just because I'm in the culture doesn't mean I somehow feel slighted because someone decides to go out in drag on a dare, or because they think it's funny. It's okay to joke about your gender being an ""attack helicopter"". I mean, who hasn't had a passing attraction to military hardware? It would solve many otherwise socially awkward moments with coworkers. Pew. Pew. 


One of (many) unfortunate things to come out of the disreputable institution of Political Correctness is the idea that a person's identity can't be mix and match. Take a little from this culture, a little from that, and make it their own. That's at the core of what freedom of expression and individuality is, and it's under siege now with the misguided idea that it's wrong to ""appropriate"". No, it's completely appropriate to appropriate -- that's the thing about culture. I don't lose my identity because someone saw something about me and said ""Oh hey, that's cool. I'm going to do that now too!"" Culture is meant to be shared. Saying only certain people can do certain things is what created this whole mess. 


But back to being Pope. Political Correctness has made all of us in the life part Pope. We can't just go to church, as it were, we have to stand on ceremony. We have to bless others' opinions about the culture, hand out instructional materials on how to properly read The Script(ure), and others (for reasons beyond me) expect some kind of divine retribution when an ever-shifting myriad of invisible boundaries get stepped over by wayward sheep. 


Thing is, this approach actually sucks. I know everyone had a different childhood but there are a *few* common experiences, and one of those was adults trying to make everyone play nice. So if someone got excluded, Helpful Adult #395 (""I'm Helping!"") would push the kid back into the group, tell everyone to play nice and try to guilt and shame them with a ""Well how would *you* like it?"" And ya know something? That kid was hated for it. And once the helpful adult, satisfied at having gained some karma for doing good, had left... things were usually worse than if they'd just left it alone. Now we're all adults and somehow we forgot that childhood lesson. We can't be better than we are.


That's often how I feel with all these attempts people make at being 'inclusive'; Things like starting social gatherings with people going around the room and giving their name, preferred pronouns, etc., and whenever someone gets the pronouns wrong there's almost a dog pile on the poor bastard who did. I don't feel great seeing that, or hearing about it. And I hear about it -- I can't *not* hear about it, because people want me, the Queer Pope, to know they did the Right Thing that time. Well, as Queer Pope, I guess here's what my sermon is;


&gt; You're going to fuck this up. You'll use the wrong name, wrong pronouns, and yeah it's gonna sting. But here's the thing about that: Are you trying? Ok, then we're cool. Hey, I get being uncomfortable and confused -- I call that Tuesday in Popeville. You have my permission to get it wrong, and not feel bad when it happens. Because it will. Probably often, at least for awhile. 



&gt; You don't have to be a queen to like drag music. You can have a rainbow handbag and still be straight. We have a unique cultural identity which isn't harmed when people borrow from it. I look at it like lending friends my favored hoodie or top -- just wash it when you bring it back. It's okay to borrow. 


&gt; What's not okay is to make yourself a caricature. Don't be an ass about it. That's it. And don't worry about getting it wrong; Even if you offend someone, a sincere apology is all that's required. I often feel like we, as a society, have run afoul of common courtesy and decency in our rush to elevate it. I don't like people looking down on others or calling them backwards because they struggle with this. 


&gt; I struggled with it! I drove the goddamned struggle bus through the middle of Struggletown, in reverse, during a category five shit storm. I get it. And I forgive anyone who is; I won't judge someone poorly because they keep screwing up. I wish this were easy. For everyone, myself included. But it's not, and I'm not going to belittle or marginalize anyone by acting like it is. Tolerance has to go both ways.


And that's it. It seems like such an obvious thing to say that I shouldn't have to say it. I actually wish I didn't have to keep having this conversation over and over again, and that I lived in a world where people didn't feel like they're walking on egg shells around me over The Pronoun Question. It's not really a step up from where I was before Le Revolution -- which was telling people and then having them trip over themselves trying to disassociate sex and gender. I'm still just as uncomfortable. 


All I (or anyone) can ask is to try and understand, and respect my choices. Not just about my pronouns, but life in general. There's a million little things about all of us that shouldn't have to be explained or justified. All I really want, is for this to be one of those things too. There doesn't have to be a reason besides that I asked. And it shouldn't be a big deal when mistakes are made -- it's what comes after that matters. 


In the end, in all the ways we relate to each other, we let each other down. The ones we hurt the most are the ones we're closest to. What matters isn't when it happens, but what we do after to make it better. So to all my Pope friends... forgive, and grow. And give others permission to do the same, because it's something that isn't heard enough. This is how we worship a world we try so hard to love. Our minds and bodies are often confusing but our love doesn't have to be -- for ourselves *or* each other.

2018-11-06 12:32:06,9unwmj,1,1,"Is it bad for someone like me to be taking testosterone when I've only got a moderate amount of dysphoria? 

My dysphoria stems from feeling uncomfortable and out of place being a woman. It stems from feeling happier with a flat chest and smaller thighs. It stems from feeling more complete with a low voice because my feminine voice makes me feel uncomfortable and crushes my self-esteem. 

I was masculine to begin with, it was my voice that gave me away the most, and the idea that my chest would only continue to develop without top surgery makes me upset. I feel like these are what needs to be changed in order to improve my life for the better. 

I don't like the mental changes on testosterone, believe me, I've been on hormones for 3 months and only just got back onto the minimum dose after the last 3 weeks off being off them. It got to the point where I felt detached from my surroundings. I no longer enjoyed things that I did beforehand, such as focusing on my appearance. I consider myself a bit of a poser. I enjoy dying my hair and dressing in strange clothes. I'm talking going outside in a jabot blouse and top hat. But on the hormones, whether placebo or not, I didn't feel comfortable doing so. 

Wait... comfortable... does this mean being on hormones increased my dysphoria? Oh jeez, there's no telling anymore. My head has always been wishy-washy in one way or another, and I've often feared someone may point this out to me eventually. It's sure strange though, since I love what testosterone has done with my shoulders and the excess hair has been great. Where exactly is this all coming from?

Maybe it's the idea that there isn't much to be altered when it comes to my transition. Unlike those who are binary trans, I have a lot less mental agony to deal with. I fully acknowledge the desperation some may have to begin hormones. I understand that in many cases it's a life or death situation. And because if I have little dysphoria and won't be taking hormones full term... well... what kind of freak does this make me? I could probably be lumped in just fine with those ""trenders"" people go on about, whether real or not, I feel that as a result people would just think I'm doing this for some cosmetic rush. 

I do, however, wonder whether my dysphoria would've been more prominent if I weren't naturally androgynous. Not to rub it in. I'm just saying that if I wasn't naturally hairy and had a larger chest... maybe it would be different. Which is probably why it stumped the Hell out of that lady I spoke with on the phone the other week. She worked for part of a transgender hotline, and being trans herself she got quite upset over the fact I was starting hormones but wasn't 100% stuck on how uncomfortable my body made me. In her case, she expected me to feel much more anxiety over the way I looked. (Hotline was mainly there for sharing thoughts and feelings about transitioning/life in general. A support line). 

I also wonder how much it would affect me to place myself on hormones just to see what happens. Is it okay to do this to myself? I mean, there's no other way I'm going to get answers. And the gender clinic refuses to perform top surgery unless I've been on hormones for 6 - 10 months. 

Is there much harm in starting and stopping? I've been on 3 months. I've stopped for just under a month. And it might only take me another 3/4 months to get the changes I've needed. 

I just hope no stupid stuff happens in between. I'm great at freaking out and taking stuff to the extreme.

A few more changes I couldn't handle was the inability to cry, the loss of connection to my personality, and the genuine feeling that I was turning into somebody I was not (mentally). It was hard for me to relate to others. I had a hard to focusing, articulating my thoughts. Even writing became difficult. My head just felt empty, nothing was working properly. (Again. This doesn't usually happen on hormones. And it may just be me who's causing these effects). ",genderqueer,My life is confusing. I just don't understand myself..

A support line). \n\nI also wonder how much it would affect me to place myself on hormones just to see what happens. Is it okay to do this to myself? I mean, there\'s no other way I\'m going to get answers. And the gender clinic refuses to perform top surgery unless I\'ve been on hormones for 6 - 10 months. \n\nIs there much harm in starting and stopping? I\'ve been on 3 months. I\'ve stopped for just under a month. And it might only take me another 3/4 months to get the changes I\'ve needed. \n\nI just hope no stupid stuff happens in between. I\'m great at freaking out and taking stuff to the extreme.\n\nA few more changes I couldn\'t handle was the inability to cry, the loss of connection to my personality, and the genuine feeling that I was turning into somebody I was not (mentally). It was hard for me to relate to others. I had a hard to focusing, articulating my thoughts. Even writing became difficult. My head just felt empty, nothing was working properly. (Again. This doesn\'t usually happen on hormones. And it may just be me who\'s causing these effects). ', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': ""My life is confusing. I just don't understand myself..

2018-11-08 01:39:13,9v5ohq,2,1,"So I started this line of thinking lately that has lead to a lot of questions about gender identity and I'm realizing I know so little about it (kinda conservative family upbringing orz). I've always considered myself cis-female and actually experience a little body dysphoria over my slight facial hirsutism. My features are also a bit more andro than I would like and I get really hurt when people say I look masculine. Pronoun preference is strongly she/her.

Outside of this though I often feel like I'm being assumed as fitting a certain social role that is wrong. With the one exception of pronouns - when it comes to how people treat me and the assumptions they make around social interactions I just really wish gender wasn't even a thing. In terms of behavior and preferences I'm just me, I like some traditionally masculine things and some traditionally feminine things - I react in the way I react and I don't consider it masculine or feminine. I get twitchy when guys assume they should watch their language around me or people question how I manage working in a male dominated environment. I get downright grumpy when I'm excluded from activities that I am interested in because those taking part want it to be just man-time, and I often feel uncomfortable taking part in girl-time because a lot of those activities involve stuff I just have no interest in. I thought this was just normal discomfort with societal pressures but it happens so often and it really is a case of ""could you just ignore my gender for a second here"" that I'm now questioning that.

It's best summarized I guess as gender to me is the state of my physical identity, and has nothing to do with my personality or preferences, but it's also how I want to be seen (for example around my male friends I want to be seen, not as the ""cool girl"", closer to ""one of the guys"", but really just ""one of us"" without any reference to gender at all).

Some time ago I bought a binder from gc2b. It was a full tank-length style binder, and I liked it fine, except that when I sat while wearing it, the compression panel came down low enough that it cut into my tummy and made me look like I had the muffin top from hell. I later learned this is because the full-length tank styles were meant for people with more abundant breast tissue, which absolutely does not describe me. 

So recently I bought two more binders, in the half-length style. I like them quite a bit, the size is good, and for the most part, they're comfy. The problem is that now the bottoms roll/bunch up a lot, and at the end of a work day I've got bunched up material kind of digging into me, right around where the bottom bra band would sit. 

Turns out I've got a pretty short torso, all things considered; on top of that I'm very pear-shaped and that A-line flare (for lack of a better term) starts pretty high up. Is there anything I can do to help prevent binders from rolling or bunching up like this? I feel confident it's not that there's anything wrong with the manufacture, I just have a wildly incompatible torso shape for binding, and am just looking for whatever options I can find to compensate for that.

It was a full tank-length style binder, and I liked it fine, except that when I sat while wearing it, the compression panel came down low enough that it cut into my tummy and made me look like I had the muffin top from hell. I later learned this is because the full-length tank styles were meant for people with more abundant breast tissue, which absolutely does not describe me. \n\nSo recently I bought two more binders, in the half-length style. I like them quite a bit, the size is good, and for the most part, they're comfy. The problem is that now the bottoms roll/bunch up a lot, and at the end of a work day I've got bunched up material kind of digging into me, right around where the bottom bra band would sit. \n\nTurns out I've got a pretty short torso, all things considered; on top of that I'm very pear-shaped and that A-line flare (for lack of a better term) starts pretty high up. Is there anything I can do to help prevent binders from rolling or bunching up like this? I feel confident it's not that there's anything wrong with the manufacture, I just have a wildly incompatible torso shape for binding, and am just looking for whatever options I can find to compensate for that. \n\nThanks in advance!

I was AMAB and have only very recently (after about 8 years of questioning both my sexuality and Gender Identity) realised that I define myself as Genderqueer. To me, my Genderqueer identity is a mixture of not having a strong feeling of belonging to any Gender, wanting to live my daily life as androgynous (or slighty more feminine), whilst also knowing that in different occasions I prefer to highlight my masculine personality/traits (not that I have  particularly strong ones) and at other points really live up to traditional feminine stereotypes. For the most part this expression of my Genderqueer identity I expect to show through clothes and make-up etc... however, I have recently started questioning if I have any feelings of Dysphoria.

&amp;#x200B;

My Genderqueer journey began with 'cross dressing' at the age of 13 in private (im now 21) - I never felt like I wasn't a man (then again I never felt like I was I just beleived the societal idea that having a penis at birth makes you a man) and originally I thought 'cross dressing' was part of my Queer sexuality. I certainly never felt like I had Dysphoria. That was until I started talking to some of my fellow LGBTQ+ freinds and they said some of the stuff I had been feeling may well come under Genderqueer Dysphoria. So My questios here is, how can I go about altering the elements of my body/personality that I dont like to further live comfortably as a Genderqueer person?

&amp;#x200B;

Facial Hair: I hate it, always have on me, even from well before I was questioning my Gender. I shave everyday but I still have a shadow - any advice on this?

Physique: I am quite tall and thin, 6'3 infact. I have never really liked my body (though I much prefer it now that I have shaved in a more stereotypically way. I am looking at buying some kind of underbust corset to give myself a more feminine looking body - is there any recamendations? Equally I would like to, on some occasions, make it look as if I have breasts (nothing large, maybe B cup) - is there anyway to achieve this? For the most part I dont like being so flat chested but sometimes I do so I dont think surgery would be a good option?

Face Structure: I never really liked the structre of my face, are there any good ways to make it look more adrogynous/feminine?

&amp;#x200B;

Sexual Organs: I dont have a problem with these per say, its just on occasions where I would like to feel more feminie I find myself not liking how they look when I wear feminine underwear - is there any advice on this?

&amp;#x200B;

Again, apoligies for the long post, its just I still have quite a few questions about a lot of things having only recently come across this term and having discovered than many aspects of myself I thought were to do with my sexuality are actually my Gender.

Sorry in advance as this is probably gonna be ramble-y...I haven‚Äôt slept and my thoughts are super jumbled and I‚Äôm nervous talking about this. For some background info, I‚Äôm a 24 afab person who usually identifies as agender. I guess I‚Äôm asking for advice if anyone has some, as well as ranting a bit?

Tl;dr: not sure how to deal with bottom dysphoria as an afab non-binary who is questioning whether they may actually be ftm. Really confused and not sure where to go from here to help the dysphoria/identity confusion.

I have social dysphoria around my name and pronouns, but it‚Äôs manageable. I‚Äôm usually fine with presenting femme and I‚Äôm fine with my curves. Chest dysphoria hits pretty hard once in a while, but I can usually kinda deal with it okay.

What‚Äôs killing me is bottom dysphoria. It‚Äôs...bad. It‚Äôs affecting my relationship and my depression has taken me to a new low. It just feels so, so wrong; it makes me squeamish to think about and any sort of contact (sexual or otherwise) with any part of it fills me with a sense of dread. I‚Äôm not sure what I can do. I think I‚Äôd be happiest with nothing down there, but the thought of having a different set of genitals seems totally okay with me.

Also, I‚Äôve recently begun questioning whether I‚Äôm agender or ftm. I know I would‚Äôve been much happier born as a cis male (I think about this a lot), and from a young age I‚Äôve felt very awkward in my body (I still do) and always considered myself more masculine. It was drilled into my head as a kid that being masculine as a girl is bad, so I‚Äôve been dressing super femme most of my life, and I feel like I‚Äôm compensating for something. I haven‚Äôt tried masc to see how I feel because I feel like I have a mental block about it/I‚Äôm scared/my chest is really hard to hide.

Seeing other people like me was fucking terrifying.

I felt like I'd escaped one set of stereotypes, only to have a new set crammed down my throat. Can't I just be like my friends, who aren't obsessed with shoes, dresses, and makeup and define themselves by their social circles instead of how they look? I guessed not.


It's like being around others like me just amplifies my own self-esteem and image problems to the point of being physically painful and exhausting. It's hard for me to even watch Youtube 'howto' videos and those people look a lot happier and adjusted. I just can't sit through it for more than a couple minutes before I have to turn it off. 


It's frustrating that I can't push away my own feelings and actually connect with the community.

I still beat myself up though for not even being able to watch a video, in my own room, about something that defines a big part of who I am and is part of my life. I'm also a gamer -- I can watch hours of streams of people who fit every bad stereotype there (poor hygiene, social skills, etc.) and it doesn't bother me. This shouldn't be any different, and yet it is.

While this post deals mainly with issues of trans masculine nonbinary dysphoria, of course trans feminine and binary people offering support or ideas is more than welcome.


I'd also like to apologize in advance if I don't make much sense. I hav lots of trouble describing particular aspects of my dysphoria so I use metaphors a lot. I'm also really really struggling. 


~ ~ ~ ~ ~  ~


Ok so I'm here today because I'm really struggling with dysphoria and depression. So my situation is I am an afab genderfluid person with severe fluctuating dysphoria.


I'm just gonna describe my dysphoria a bit before moving on. So some days I am fine with no dysphoria, other days I have intense dysphoria and still some days I fall in between. Generally my dysphoria switches in larger.... Chunks of time? It's not a daily thing but more biweekly maybe, and it tends to be like an underlying dysphoria with really bad spurts. Think of like a low humming sound that sometimes increases in volume momentarily. I get dysphoria about everything from my chest to my jawline. I have ""phantom dick"" syndrome. I also get this really weird feeling when dysphoria suddenly intensifies.... It's like something inside of me is bursting through my core? Like imagine a spirit leaving your body (without the death). It feels like how one may imagine that would feel. Not corporal, but still there.  Sometimes my dysphoria leaves me nauseous, etc etc.



You may be saying well it sounds like testosterone is for you! However as a genderfluid person I am putting emphasis on dysphoric *fluctuations*. It follows that if I were to go on t, I'd have girl days still, and would therefore have a sort of reverse dysphoria. That's one issue with that. This leads into the next issue, which is of course I am still feminine as well so being on t and dressing and appearing feminine may be dangerous in some situations and I am afraid of being harmed.


This leads into my issues surrounding hate and bigotry. People barely get binary trans people, not to mention us nonbinary folks. Transphobia in general hurts and scares me. Then there is the nonbinary specific Transphobia which I have to deal with as well, from both within and outside of the trans community. The hate is present and seems to be growing. It's taking a big toll on me. I'm technically out, but I'm scared of being visible in any way. Right now I appear like a masculine girl I suppose, so I haven't had to say much about my gender outside of my small social circle. All of this, the dysphoria and the hate, has led me to despair


I will never be able to live my truth. Hatred is everywhere. Dysphoria is atypical and I can't deal with it anymore. I am tired of being viewed as a joke and I'm tired of feeling I will never be free of dysphoria. I am worried. I have found over the last two years that I'm experiencing something that may be some kind of dissociation : periodically it feels as if I am not in the physical world, that nothing is real. It randomly feels like my clothes go missing so I have to touch my legs to make sure my pants are still there. Sounds silly but it is very distressing. Sometimes i can't feel the ground, it's like I'm on clouds. I'm not sure if this is related to my dysphoria and depression but it may be. I feel like i am going crazy.


Yes I am on the waiting list to see therapists. It is just a waiting game now


So I'm asking for advice. Particularly from trans masculine people in similar situations, though all support helps. Also please hold off the hate comments and PM's. I had someone from here message me telling me to kill myself for being nonbinary. That didn't help at all.


Has anyone else experienced anything like this?


How do I deal with the hate?


How can I deal with dysphoria in non medical ways?


I'm becoming filled with despair and having many thoughts of just ending it all

I hav lots of trouble describing particular aspects of my dysphoria so I use metaphors a lot. I\'m also really really struggling. \n\n\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~  ~\n\n\nOk so I\'m here today because I\'m really struggling with dysphoria and depression. So my situation is I am an afab genderfluid person with severe fluctuating dysphoria.\n\n\nI\'m just gonna describe my dysphoria a bit before moving on. So some days I am fine with no dysphoria, other days I have intense dysphoria and still some days I fall in between. Generally my dysphoria switches in larger.... Chunks of time? It\'s not a daily thing but more biweekly maybe, and it tends to be like an underlying dysphoria with really bad spurts. Think of like a low humming sound that sometimes increases in volume momentarily. I get dysphoria about everything from my chest to my jawline. I have ""phantom dick"" syndrome. I also get this really weird feeling when dysphoria suddenly intensifies.... It\'s like something inside of me is bursting through my core? Like imagine a spirit leaving your body (without the death). It feels like how one may imagine that would feel. Not corporal, but still there.  Sometimes my dysphoria leaves me nauseous, etc etc.\n\n\n\nYou may be saying well it sounds like testosterone is for you! However as a genderfluid person I am putting emphasis on dysphoric *fluctuations*. It follows that if I were to go on t, I\'d have girl days still, and would therefore have a sort of reverse dysphoria. That\'s one issue with that. This leads into the next issue, which is of course I am still feminine as well so being on t and dressing and appearing feminine may be dangerous in some situations and I am afraid of being harmed.\n\n\nThis leads into my issues surrounding hate and bigotry. People barely get binary trans people, not to mention us nonbinary folks. Transphobia in general hurts and scares me. Then there is the nonbinary specific Transphobia which I have to deal with as well, from both within and outside of the trans community. The hate is present and seems to be growing. It\'s taking a big toll on me. I\'m technically out, but I\'m scared of being visible in any way.

Anyways, I‚Äôve always had a hard time understanding the differences between biological sex, sexuality, and gender. 

After conversations with friends, I‚Äôve learned that gender is considered more cultural and based on how a person feels, as opposed to biological sex, which is based on anatomy (at birth). 

Sexuality and gender are of course different, but I‚Äôm a bit confused with recent conversations regarding these.  For example, there have been instances in the past of people identifying themselves (sexuality based) as being attracted to underage people.  This has been frowned upon by most.  Also, there have been instances of people identifying as either younger/older than their ‚Äúactual‚Äù (not sure if correct word choice) age, and/or identifying as inanimate objects.  How are these dictated as being either accurate or inaccurate (aside from moral norms that already exist)?  

In the future, as the US and World become more progressive, how should/will this type of thing be decided on?  

Also, when it comes to things like the census, job applications, college applications, etc, how should this be represented?  I could see gender preferences being on applications and such to ensure the preferred pronouns are used.  However, should this replace the original ‚Äúbiological sex‚Äù section?

2018-11-26 06:29:12,a0gw1w,4,1,"Hey everybody.
I'm afab and agender.
Been on T for just over a year now.

The longer I'm on T though, the more I start to get dysphoric from the changes.
I know I'm not cis, and I've known that since childhood, but it almost seems like my dysphoria is incurable and I don't know what to do.

I started T mostly with the intention of changing my voice, and maybe getting some face/body changes. So far, I've had one VERY minor voice drop and nothing else as far as any of those changes go. 
I knew to expect other changes though, and that I couldn't pick and choose them. Even so, I was willing to deal with things I didn't want to deal with severe voice dysphoria. I was always fairly hairy pre-T, and very content with the amount of body hair I had. I had a MAJOR increase in growth almost immediately, and after awhile, I had so much hair that it caused dysphoria, but if I shaved, I also got dysphoria. There's a brief window of time between shaving and full growth where I'm comfortable though. Facial hair? Started growing it by about 2 1/2 months, and usually have to shave daily now. Hate it. Huge source of- you guessed it, dysphoria. I was neutral on bottom growth until about 8 or 9 months in, and out of nowhere, I started hating it too. I'd be willing to accept all of these things if my voice would actually fucking change, but it won't. My T levels are comfortably in the male ranges but not too high, and have been since very early on, not to mention I believe I was told in the past that I have naturally high testosterone levels for someone afab. It really seems like the only positive thing I got out of this whole mess was the end to my monthly cycle (I had one maybe 3 or 4 days after I started T, and that was the last one Ive had). Im desperate for my voice to change but everything else is making me miserable. I'm debating stopping in 6 months at my next appointment, but I really don't know what to do. I look and sound exactly like a somewhat hairier, acne covered version of my pre-T self and it's incredibly discouraging. 

Another issue is my chest and bottom dysphoria. I'm so poor and my efforts at crowdfunding have been pathetic, so I don't see myself reasonanly affording top surgery for another 3-5 years. My family is poor too, so there's no chance of someone else paying for it. 
My bottom dysphoria is a confusing and complicated beast on it's own. I absolutely cannot stand my natal junk, but the idea of having a dick is only slightly better. Both cause me massive amounts of dysphoria. Honestly of metoidioplasty and phalloplasty, phallo is the one that I'd be most comfortable with, but even it just feels so wrong to me. I'm never going to be happy unless I quite literally have no genitals, and I'm not entirely sure that's possible right now, or ever in my lifetime.

2018-11-27 16:36:14,a0wh03,0,1,"Hey all!

I just listened to one of my favourite albums, by one of my favourite bands today, and I started to see one particular song, Lose This Skin, with vocals by Tyomon Dogg, in a new light. Regardless of the original intention of the song, I started thinking, damn, this could really be a trans/intersex/genderqueer theme song.  
And, I just wanted to share the new experience I had with this song.

[Here's the song, with lyrics in the description.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtWdVX6LS8w)   
So, I wanna go through the lyrics, with commentary on how I just experienced the song.

*First verse*
&gt; Come with me. I won't hide

""Won't hide"" = I'm coming out. ""Come with me"" = Let's do it together, as in, do it with me, so we stand together - basically following Harvey Milk's idea of how we can normalise trans* people and build tolerance.

&gt; We're going on a ride

Moving from one thing to another - the personal experience of transformation.

&gt; We meet each day, use time to see

Stand together, let's support each other.

&gt; While we're young and almost free

Don't keep postponing your transformation, nor the work to change society towards tolerance and acceptance. We're not *quite* free from our self internalised denial/self-loathing, etc., nor the discriminatrion and hate we face from society at large.

*Chorus*

&gt; I've got to lose this skin I'm imprisoned in
&gt; Got to lose this skin I'm imprisoned in

I need to change - ""this skin"" is the body/gender I was born into, but it's a prison, I can't realise myself in it.

*Second verse*

&gt; Do not turn our head to see

&gt; All the things you think we've got

&gt; Do not turn or hate to see

&gt; What happened to the wife of Lot

Most lyrics on the internet say it's ""turn or hate to see"", but that doesn't make sense, unless it's a play on words, when you consider the parallel to the wife of Lot below.  
Anyway, again, this is a parallel to the biblical story of Sodom and Gomorrah, where God says they're not to look back when they flee, or they'll be turned to pillars of salt. Lot's wife does it anyway, and does indeed turn to salt. Anyway, I think this could mean that we shouldn't grow complacent towards change - we still have a road ahead.

*Chorus

*Third verse*

&gt; We're alone or so they say

We're told that we're freaks, this is not normal. We're pariahs, not conforming to expected standards of gender.

&gt; We're not on our own in that way

But he's saying, that's not true. We've got each other, and we've got allies.

&gt; When we're alone it's real tough going

But it's really fucking rough when you feel like you're alone. When you feel like you're a freak for experiencing dysphoria - especially the case for a lot of young people that are not familiar with the fact that they're not alone in their experience.

&gt; We can take a part in someone else's play

But we *can* be there together, support and reassure each other.

*Chorus*

*Fourth verse*

&gt; Come with me, I thought he said

I'm not sure - this sounds like he/she thought they had a friend and an ally. But it turns out they ended up shunning them. I'm not sure, though, when you consider the rest of the verse.

&gt; But that's not him anymore, he's dead

They're not who I thought they were. I've cut ties, because I don't deserve their hate.  
Alternately, though I don't know how this would relate to the previous part of the verse: it could be another trans* who's ""died"" and ""reborn"". They've transformed from their old self, to become their true selves.

&gt; What's it like to be so free

How does it feel to finally be free from that hate? Or, alternately, how does it feel to finally have gone through that transformation, and finally, physically, be your real self.

&gt; So free it looks like lost to me

How does it feel to be free from the cage that was the hate of their ""friend"", or free from the dysphoria of feeling trapped in a body that's not yours.

---

Well, this might not be the original intention of what the song is supposed to be about. It could also be about other ways of feeling alone and shunned, or a host of other things. Though, as I recall, Joe Strummer *did* have an intersex friend and mentor in the 70's. I believe I read that, but now I can't find any sources confirming that.  
In any case, when it comes to art, while it's interesting to ponder the intent of the piece, your own experience and interpretation is just as valid. ""We Are Family"" is the first thing that comes to mind - it wasn't meant to be a queer anthem, but it's now been co-opted, the original artists, Sister Sledge, they've embraced that. I think that has value too.

I guess I should say that I'm not trans* myself, though I am queer, and a big trans* ally. When I use ""I"" or ""we"" in the commentary, it's from the narrator's perspective. I won't pretend to understand your experience completely, but I can emphasise, and try to support my transgender friends as best I can. Anyway, like I said, I haven't experienced your going through what you're going through, and I apologise if I've said anything that might be offensive, or misunderstood something. I *can* say that it's all in good faith, though. :)

Well, a bit of a long winded wall of text, all this, but it was nice for me to put down in writing, and sharing - and if any of this makes sense to someone else, all the better. :)

1. Do you know you are dreaming during your dreams?
2. What   POV/perspective do you dream on? (first person, third person, other    persons POV, not present/ feels like watching a movie, alternate    between perspectives, etc...)
3. Do you feel any physical sensations in your dreams?
4. Are your dreams usually realistic or surreal?
5. Do you have ""super powers"" in your dreams? (ie flying, breathing underwater, invulnerability, etc...)
6. Is your dream body different from your real one? If so, how so?
7. Do    you have any dreams where you start out as yourself (or someone     else)  then swap into someone else's body and see the body you were     before  through their eyes, then swap back again, and so on, and do you     ever see  sometimes both people at the same time in 3rd person? Do  you    alternate  between controlling either?
8. Do you control your actions in your dreams? Do you have any degree of control over your dreams?
9. How fast does time go by in your dreams? Is it like waking life, faster, or like a movie?
10. What is your sexual orientation and gender identity? (I think this manifests itself in dreams)

My answers:

1. I always know I am dreaming.
2. Usually   3rd person (I see myself from outside of my body while still    controlling it), sometimes 1st person, occasionally alternate, rarely I    am not present and I am just an observer and I remember having at  least   once ""possessed"" another person's body and controlled them.
3. No, I don't feel anything.
4. They are quite surreal.
5. Yes,   I can fly/float in the air sometimes, breathe underwater and I am    usually invulnerable. I can also rewind and change the future sometimes    and change the scene when the dream takes a turn I don't like.
6. Usually   my body is the same, but I dream of myself often in the body of  other   women, in a male body, in the body of some videogame character, as  a   fictional character or actor, some animal, etc... I often alternate  in   the same dream.
7. Not that I remember. When I swap bodies my body usually disappears.
8. I can control my actions fully, and the environment to a degree.
9. In   my dreams time seems to go by faster than normal. My dreams are  usually  long and lots of things happen. I can fill 2+ pages just with  keywords  when I wake up (I keep a dream journal and when I wake up I  just write  down the keywords to help me remember)
10. Female, hetero-romantic asexual.

2018-11-30 00:07:30,a1n1dn,1,1,"Going through all this paperwork was hard. But it did remind me of one thing: I'm a lot better at expressing myself in writing than verbally. I'll say this as a heart to heart -- and hope it can bring at least a little peace.


I want to start with one of the greatest things you ever did for me: To give me a computer -- and get me interested in them. Without question I would not have survived to adulthood without that bit of insight. Second, but no less, that you held on and kept the door open for me growing up. 


I knew living with my dad was a mistake. Even just a few months after the final order came it was obvious to everyone -- except the courts. I couldn't imagine and would not understand until decades later just how monumental the damage was. ""The best interests of the child"" will forever be why I will NEVER trust anyone. 


I refuse to trust anything that describes itself as authority. I will never trust anyone, ever, who says they are acting in my best interests. That's what authority says. Authority lies. At 34, it's clear that scar will be with me the rest of my days. I'll never truly trust anyone but myself. All trust is conditional for me. 


Every fucking kind of expert has tried to fix that twist in me. They're all quite sure of themselves -- that to be a functional adult it's necessary to trust authority. Conforming is about surrendering individuality to the group. That is, reduced to the essential quality, what authority's role is. 

""Incompletely socialized"" is a phrase that accurately described me for a long time. It's impossible to normalize when every person is a threat under shadow -- every interaction has an ulterior motive. The world becomes a dark and terrifying place. My dad's little ""gift"" to me, I suppose. 


He never did find a way out of the darkness. Sometimes I read what the psychologists say about me. I'm afraid I might be the same. Turning out like your parents is a universal fear I suppose. Turning out like MY parents doubly so. No offense.

The only thing that saved me from a life of antisocial tendencies and a lack of respect for others, myself, or life in every manner it can be defined... was you. Only you. You hung on when all others abandoned me. You kept your foot in the door when every last mother fucker said it was pointless, wrongheaded -- and so many other adjectives. I will be forever grateful for that. 


It's precisely because of that love that I've stayed angry at you for so long. You were the last person still worthy of my trust. I knew you would have a hard time with my coming out. I still remember the night you flipped your lid after catching me in a tutu. 


Until then I hadn't felt like I was 'wrong inside' -- just a victim of adults who put me on a chess board called 'best interests'. Being a child it was easy to forgive and forget in spite of the injury. Afterall I was used to it. Even by then I didn't trust anyone who wasn't family. A conflicted family that didn't know how to be one but family all the same. 


I wanted, more than anything in the world, to be a part of a family. To have at least a little peace, trust, love, that I saw everybody else getting. I saw other people effortlessly gliding through life as though life itself was some divine gift. I hated them for that. That above all and perhaps nothing but.


I will remember, for the rest of my life, the day I felt the sun on my face. Not the sensation of the sun but the feeling. The warmth and beauty. In that moment and never before I knew in my heart of hearts it was okay -- to not be okay. It was okay to say it hurt. It was okay to not be strong all the time. The universe opened the door just a crack in that moment to reveal there was more to living than just surviving. Then it slammed it shut again. 


It was still a long journey back into the light. So many feelings I'd never felt before. So much I thought I would explode. That I'd die. 


Every day was too much. Every day I'd lay down in bed. I'd try to breathe when the weight on my chest was so crushing asthma would have been a welcome respite. I'd felt alone or hated for too long. I wasn't entirely sure I could feel any other way. But there you were, still, at the end of all things. 


You'd been there the whole time. How many people could still love someone so damaged? I was barely still a person by the time I got the fuck out of Wisconsin. You loved me anyway. I finally started reconnecting with myself. 

I was filled with a hatred of the world that left me ruined in body and mind. It burned a hole in me, day after day. It lessened just a little, just a tiny bit, each day. Every hug had a tiny bit of forgiveness in a cruel world. It was hope that someday I could pass as a person again. Not some broken thing that had been left to die. 


When I came out a few years later it was to a parent who I thought understood me. Me and my suffering -- in ways nobody else ever could. Rejecting that shattered everything I'd become. I'd left my own personal holocaust. 


I was embarking on a journey very few have ever taken -- and far fewer have survived. It made me question everything. I had been wrong. I *was* wrong. I had to be. It was the only way to reconcile love with hate. Back into the dark I went; The comforting and understanding dark.


I limped on. I'd come too far to turn around by then. I felt filled with a purpose -- to seek out the me I should have been instead of the me that I had become. But it was buried again under a mountain of self-doubt and self-loathing. Yet I kept having these feelings. They just kept bubbling up, insistently, urgently. 


I escaped into depression many times. I just couldn't deal with it. I hated with the burning passion of a thousand suns. I never had the chance to confront and resolve my status as a transgender person when it could have saved me. 


I could have avoided the changes to my body. They now forever define and diminish me. It's a door forever closed. It is doubtful I'll ever transition to the point others can't see me as a ruined person so obviously fitting into neither mold. I still hate myself -- and the world -- at times. It seems an utterly insurmountable challenge to just. be. normal. 


I want to be just a face in the crowd. I know I never will. It costs too much money. Between my odds of surviving all the surgeries, and the odds that they'd ever be good enough to give me what I want -- that's my rock and the hard place. 


That enigma kept sending me back into fucking depression. I exhausted myself from the constant oscillations from one extreme to the other. From joy to fear, love to indifference -- from one hate to the next. To this day I still feel it all. It has not diminished. That's why it's regarded as a mental illness. It's not because of anything I am. It's what it means for every relationship I have... or will ever have.


There is no place I can hide from that. No safe place for me to heal my hurts. No church, no temple, no god -- and no hope. Starting out, I took long drives and long walks. I still searched, as I do today. I'm sure I'll never find what I am looking for: Peace. I try anyway.


Every time I drive, every time I walk, I go west. When I have to think I go west. When I feel too much -- west. Or too little -- west. I didn't realize that for a decade that west was the way I had left Wisconsin. Along with everything that meant to me. West was my safe place. West was the way towards home. An aching for the home I'd never known. 


Eventually, I learned to live with it. I started trusting myself again. I found new reserves of confidence that my emotions were real. That I was real. And, in time, that the world was too. I found the strength that had carried me for so long, but lost so easily. And I turned all of that hate that I felt for the world on you.


That was wrong of me. And, I am sorry. 


I don't believe in apologies. Asking me to apologize with any frequency results in unpleasantness. You do. That's why I have an intense dislike of the word 'gratitude'. The right kind of people never ask for one. The wrong kind of people will just use it against me. I live my life today without apology or shame. I didn't for a long time.


I'm okay admitting that I'm wrong. It was never a problem for me as long as the thing that was wrong wasn't who or what I was. Easiest thing in the world. I had to know -- everything. I had to find home. The only way to do that is with eyes wide open. I have slept for too long already, and staying wrong about any of the particulars of the world just means that much longer I'm delayed in my journey.


I know now why you did what you did. I'm trying to forgive you. Forgiveness for me is far and away the hardest thing to do. Trust is the second hardest thing for me to do. Forgiving others means admitting something that's a part of me was wrong. I misjudged. Made a mistake. It means I misplaced my trust either in myself or someone else. 


There still are things you do that cut me down. I know now it's not on purpose. I know now it's just the symptoms of everything I feel is wrong in myself. That it's the world that's wrong to make me feel this way. Not you. 


I won't talk about those things -- or at least try not to. I'm trying to get away, not from you, but from having these relentless and inescapable feelings. I'm still trying to build a world where it's okay to be me. A place that will love me when I'm there and miss me when I'm gone. And a love that will finally lay down quietly and see me. I just want to be seen. 


This place is not that place. But neither is anywhere else I can go. For me this has always been an inward journey. I have great difficulty in separating the internal and external worlds I inhabit. I often oscillate wildly between them. When one hurts too much, I move to the other. It comes out in strange ways I've never understood. Sometimes I regret the things I've said and done. I swing from one extreme to the next. 


The reason why I am so inescapably angry is because I have felt, every day since I knew that you knew, that you sided with the world instead of me. Something that's so core to who I am was rejected. Every other terrible thing was taken without question or pause. Taken out of unconditional love -- until then. 


That's the true injury. It's not that you don't understand me. Fuck I don't even understand myself. Lots of people don't understand what it means to be transgender. They don't know how it twists a person up inside. Dave doesn't. He's still my best friend. A lifelong friend: Family I chose of my own free will. 


I hate myself for it but not other people. I've felt rejection my whole life. I've been hurt by others my whole life. I am very good at protecting my own identity in a world that seems hell bent on ensuring I have no place in it. 


I am angry that you chose *them* over *me*. They don't deserve my love. The world can burn for all I care. It's wished and tried for nothing less of me. That's how it feels in my heart. In my head... I know better. The two aren't on speaking terms on that one. 


All the therapy in the world can't change those feelings. I know because I've HAD all the therapy in the world. It's a battle that can only be fought and won by me. I am the ground where the war is fought. I fight with myself every day until memory yields. Until feelings yield. 


My head beats my heart into submission each day. It hates me for that, as I hate the world. In no small way I feel betrayed by my own heart -- as I feel betrayed by you. For one it's because it chose the world. For the other it's because it chose me. I'm not entirely sure which is which. 


I hope this long letter gives the answers you're looking for. I don't know how to explain why I'm this way. There is no answer. Some questions just don't have answers. That's a terribly difficult thing for me to accept. It's one I've had to on this. 


What is impossible yields to what is necessary. I'll find what I'm looking for someday; Home and comfort in my own skin. Not answers -- just better questions. It is my hope that in time you will look for the same. We're all searching for something even if we don't know it.

It made me question everything. I had been wrong. I *was* wrong. I had to be. It was the only way to reconcile love with hate. Back into the dark I went; The comforting and understanding dark.\n\n\nI limped on. I\'d come too far to turn around by then. I felt filled with a purpose -- to seek out the me I should have been instead of the me that I had become. But it was buried again under a mountain of self-doubt and self-loathing. Yet I kept having these feelings. They just kept bubbling up, insistently, urgently. \n\n\nI escaped into depression many times. I just couldn\'t deal with it. I hated with the burning passion of a thousand suns. I never had the chance to confront and resolve my status as a transgender person when it could have saved me. \n\n\nI could have avoided the changes to my body. They now forever define and diminish me. It\'s a door forever closed. It is doubtful I\'ll ever transition to the point others can\'t see me as a ruined person so obviously fitting into neither mold. I still hate myself -- and the world -- at times. It seems an utterly insurmountable challenge to just. be. normal. \n\n\nI want to be just a face in the crowd. I know I never will. It costs too much money. Between my odds of surviving all the surgeries, and the odds that they\'d ever be good enough to give me what I want -- that\'s my rock and the hard place. \n\n\nThat enigma kept sending me back into fucking depression. I exhausted myself from the constant oscillations from one extreme to the other. From joy to fear, love to indifference -- from one hate to the next. To this day I still feel it all. It has not diminished. That\'s why it\'s regarded as a mental illness. It\'s not because of anything I am. It\'s what it means for every relationship I have... or will ever have.\n\n\nThere is no place I can hide from that. No safe place for me to heal my hurts. No church, no temple, no god -- and no hope. Starting out, I took long drives and long walks. I still searched, as I do today. I\'m sure I\'ll never find what I am looking for: Peace. I try anyway.\n\n\nEvery time I drive, every time I walk, I go west. When I have to think I go west. When I feel too much -- west. Or too little -- west. I didn\'t realize that for a decade that west was the way I had left Wisconsin. Along with everything that meant to me. West was my safe place. West was the way towards home. An aching for the home I\'d never known. \n\n\nEventually, I learned to live with it. I started trusting myself again. I found new reserves of confidence that my emotions were real. That I was real. And, in time, that the world was too. I found the strength that had carried me for so long, but lost so easily. And I turned all of that hate that I felt for the world on you.\n\n\nThat was wrong of me. And, I am sorry. \n\n\nI don\'t believe in apologies. Asking me to apologize with any frequency results in unpleasantness. You do. That\'s why I have an intense dislike of the word \'gratitude\'. The right kind of people never ask for one. The wrong kind of people will just use it against me. I live my life today without apology or shame. I didn\'t for a long time.\n\n\nI\'m okay admitting that I\'m wrong. It was never a problem for me as long as the thing that was wrong wasn\'t who or what I was. Easiest thing in the world. I had to know -- everything. I had to find home. The only way to do that is with eyes wide open. I have slept for too long already, and staying wrong about any of the particulars of the world just means that much longer I\'m delayed in my journey.\n\n\nI know now why you did what you did. I\'m trying to forgive you. Forgiveness for me is far and away the hardest thing to do. Trust is the second hardest thing for me to do. Forgiving others means admitting something that\'s a part of me was wrong. I misjudged. Made a mistake. It means I misplaced my trust either in myself or someone else. \n\n\nThere still are things you do that cut me down. I know now it\'s not on purpose. I know now it\'s just the symptoms of everything I feel is wrong in myself. That it\'s the world that\'s wrong to make me feel this way. Not you. \n\n\nI won\'t talk about those things -- or at least try not to. I\'m trying to get away, not from you, but from having these relentless and inescapable feelings. I\'m still trying to build a world where it\'s okay to be me. A place that will love me when I\'m there and miss me when I\'m gone. And a love that will finally lay down quietly and see me. I just want to be seen. \n\n\nThis place is not that place. But neither is anywhere else I can go. For me this has always been an inward journey. I have great difficulty in separating the internal and external worlds I inhabit. I often oscillate wildly between them. When one hurts too much, I move to the other. It comes out in strange ways I\'ve never understood. Sometimes I regret the things I\'ve said and done. I swing from one extreme to the next. \n\n\nThe reason why I am so inescapably angry is because I have felt, every day since I knew that you knew, that you sided with the world instead of me. Something that\'s so core to who I am was rejected. Every other terrible thing was taken without question or pause. Taken out of unconditional love -- until then. \n\n\nThat\'s the true injury. It\'s not that you don\'t understand me. Fuck I don\'t even understand myself. Lots of people don\'t understand what it means to be transgender. They don\'t know how it twists a person up inside. Dave doesn\'t. He\'s still my best friend. A lifelong friend: Family I chose of my own free will. \n\n\nI hate myself for it but not other people. I\'ve felt rejection my whole life. I\'ve been hurt by others my whole life. I am very good at protecting my own identity in a world that seems hell bent on ensuring I have no place in it. \n\n\nI am angry that you chose *them* over *me*. They don\'t deserve my love. The world can burn for all I care. It\'s wished and tried for nothing less of me. That\'s how it feels in my heart. In my head... I know better. The two aren\'t on speaking terms on that one. \n\n\nAll the therapy in the world can\'t change those feelings. I know because I\'ve HAD all the therapy in the world. It\'s a battle that can only be fought and won by me. I am the ground where the war is fought. I fight with myself every day until memory yields. Until feelings yield. \n\n\nMy head beats my heart into submission each day. It hates me for that, as I hate the world. In no small way I feel betrayed by my own heart -- as I feel betrayed by you. For one it\'s because it chose the world. For the other it\'s because it chose me. I\'m not entirely sure which is which. \n\n\nI hope this long letter gives the answers you\'re looking for. I don\'t know how to explain why I\'m this way. There is no answer. Some questions just don\'t have answers. That\'s a terribly difficult thing for me to accept. It\'s one I\'ve had to on this. \n\n\nWhat is impossible yields to what is necessary. I\'ll find what I\'m looking for someday; Home and comfort in my own skin. Not answers -- just better questions. It is my hope that in time you will look for the same. We\'re all searching for something even if we don\'t know it. \n\n\nWith love,\n', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'The letter home, and how I dealt with my mother rejecting my queer status [Trigger warning: pretty much everything] [LONG]', 'created': 1543561650.0}"

I usually feel it in reaction to things that I percieve as quintessentially masculine--hearing a deep voice, certain turns of phrase sometimes do it, or even just looking at a man who embodies it. There's something alluring about masculinity, something that seems to come easily, something that is subtle but also big, loud and alive--virile, powerful even. 

Question is, how the hell do I express that? I have no idea what kinds of actions could portray the way I feel pulled toward masculinity. I'm intrigued by it, but I don't even have a word for it, let alone a means to embody it.
