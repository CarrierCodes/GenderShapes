2018-09-03 15:15:18,9cm9cm,25,41,"Hi folks. I've been pointed here after trying other subs, and taking a look at the posts I think this is the right one, finally!

So, my [33M] whole life has always been a wreck, and it never ceases to surprise me how it can actually get worse.

Lately I've been struggling with my image and a need for self care. I hit rock bottom, but I want to look well. Alas, as man, I don't feel like anything cisgender society offers is going to work for me: Male fashion is highly related to success, and I'm nothing of that, so it doesn't really work for me.

Otoh, the rituals and things that I feel that could help me (silly things like painting my nails), which are more traditionally proper of the feminine world, I'd happily indulge myself with them, but I feel they'll end up causing me more trouble than actually be of the pragmatic help I'm in need for.

For that, I've been asking about this the last weeks, first in [queer](https://www.reddit.com/r/queer/comments/955ah0/a_fashion_meets_mental_health_kind_of_post_very/), and then in [malefashionadvice](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/981hab/are_there_some_styles_or_accessories_that_i_could/), with mixed responses and some good ideas. It feels like it will be a lot of work, and in my current state of complete isolation I don't think I'll be able to make it.

That's not exactly what I'm in here for anymore though. After all this thinking the last month, this thought assaulted me:

Did I ever actually felt like a man?

While plenty of times, in the past, I've given some thought into the idea that I may be a woman (and always ending up concluding it's not like that —I love women and everything feminine, just not for myself), I never asked myself if I am a man, or if I feel like a man.

Now, this sounds really stupid because I'm actually aware of the whole genderfluid, non-binary thing, etc. And it even sounds like something really privileged I experienced, because it means I've never felt obligated to fit as a man (it has of course affected me in unconscious ways, constricting me, but it was never a worry of me —e.g. I would worry about looking good, but not about looking ""like a man"").

So, on the one hand, this feels like real privilege. Not having been consciously bound by gender norms, ever, is kind of part of the dream. I actually believe I'm not that strange, as plenty if not the majority of people live busy and fulfilling enough lives that they don't have to worry about these kind of things ever, but they would fit those feelings. (As in, they don't want to look like a man, or like a woman, but they just want to look good. It's very different, I believe.)

Another problem is that I don't feel like I identify with the queer community either. I'm 100% supportive of it, I think it's great, but maybe because of my character, maybe becase I never really struggled with this —not until now, at least—, I don't think it's my fight. I'd love to feel that way, it would be great to have something to fight for, but I don't.

Looking up at Wikipedia, it feels like I'm genderless, but not in a way that is important me. I feel like ""I don't care"", instead. I don't feel the need to refer myself as neutral, or identify as one. I won't find trouble putting down I'm a male in a legal paper, because well, I have a penis and everything else about my body is male, so biologically I am one. However, if it happened to be that I woke up with a vagina instead, it'd be ok by me.

I... don't know what I'm really asking for here. DAE have been through feeling this way? Have you found joy, in indulging yourself into things? I'm very hesitant to believe that it would work for me.

Some suggested it's just mental illness affecting me, as I struggle a lot with finding joy in things. As in, if I had a plan, this wouldn't be a worry. In the end, if I'm resorting to my body and appearance for the first time in my life, is because it's all I have left. I now understand, more than ever, people with disorders regarding their image.

One thought I'm also struggling to consolidate, is that it feels like I want to indulge myself in femininity more because I've never had (and everything hints that I'll never have) access to it, due to me never having had a proper SO in my lifetime. I love aesthetics, clothing, lingerie, but I don't love it for myself, or just for sexual excitement reasons, but more because they're nice.

[My first post about it's here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/6a8ivj/i_decided_to_start_blurring_the_lines_and_now_i/) Since then, I've slowly started to queer up my wardrobe, and over the last few months I've made a commitment to really start pushing it more and more.  


A little on me, I'm 25, and for the longest time I've simply identified as cis white gay boy from Utah, though now I can say I thoroughly feel comfortable adding genderqueer to the list of titles and right to the forefront of my identifiers.  


I've been incredibly lucky to have grown up without any major dysphoria.

Maybe this is the beginning of me testing new waters? I've always been so comfortable with He/His, but They/Theirs felt so immediately soothing in a way I wasn't expecting, much less without having to ask for it...

I didn't even know there were other options til I got here a few years ago, and even then I was in denial of their existence because of internalized homophobia and transphobia. I worked past it all and grew up. I discovered that I'm very likely biromantic asexual, or somewhere in that area. I feel attracted to multiple genders, and don't really feel sexual attraction, not that I would really know what that feels like. Part of me is really worried that all of my questioning is solely due to learning all of these new things in a short amount of time. 

It especially worries me that I've been questioning gender the past few months. It's not something I'm really too worried about, but sometimes I feel whatever it is really intensely. I have a couple friends I could maybe talk to who would know what it feels like to not be cisgender, but I feel like it's not something I should ask about. Pretty much everyone automatically assumes I'm a ciswoman and straight 100%. I guess I just give of a vibe or something? But it makes things difficult when it comes to questioning and dating.

Since I'm in a sub dealing with gender, I'm just wondering if anyone else gets the same feeling? If there's a name for it? Anything?

The best I can describe it is that I very rarely feel female. I acknowledge that I biologically am female, and I don't really mind certain aspects of it. If anything I could do without the period and breasts. The gender norms have always bothered me. Growing up I wished I was a boy. At the time, my parents gave in a bit more and let me wear more andro/masc clothes. It wasn't til I got my first period that I was expected to be female. I didn't even start trying to act female til then either. Since I stared wondering and questioning, it feels more like an in-between in a way. I still sometimes feel feminine. Sometimes I feel more masculine. There are many days I wish I were male, that I'd be happier. But I also don't feel like I'm dedicated enough to go through a transition. 

I guess the majority of days I feel content enough to stay the way I am, just a few changes I'd prefer but may not need necessarily. I've always dressed androgynously, though it's gotten more difficult because my body type is very difficult to pass as anything other than female. 

I've thought about name changes as well, just because my name is overly feminine. There are other names I like better that are more andro/masc. My friends would very likely respect it, since a few of them have done similar. I just don't want people asking questions when I'm not sure what I'm feeling.

If you're familiar with a comic that's been floating around where an afab person dresses more andro and wants to pass as male, it's in shades of purple I think, says something about being okay with their current self while also feeling like they'd be happier elsewhere. That's close to what I'm feeling.

I explained my pronouns to every every single class.

My approach was keep it short and sweet and not go into details. I explained that I preferred they/them pronouns, I gave them examples: 

""They are my science teacher, they're always wearing a bow tie, I'm so annoyed they gave us a quiz on Monday...by the way, you have a quiz on Monday."" 

I asked them to respect that my pronouns are what I would like to go by, and asked if they had any questions. The questions they asked were really thoughtful (for context I mostly teach 7th and 8th grade with one Chemistry class). They asked things such as: ""Would you like us to still call you Mr.?"" ""What should we do if we mess your pronouns?"" One student didn't even care about the pronouns and only asked what was on Monday's quiz. It made me really proud of the students I'm teaching, and hopeful for the next generation.

P.S. I wanted to thank everyone who gave me encouraging comments today, it was very sweet and exactly the sort of support I needed!

Instead, I\'m asking: ""where do I go from here?"" I feel stagnant - I don\'t know how to confront/understand these feelings. If anyone has any resources or ideas, I\'d really appreciate your advice.

2018-09-09 11:12:12,9ec89e,6,31,"Hi guys. Just a question / thinking out loud rant thing. How comfortable do you feel wearing clothes in public that are a bit “out there”?

My personal journey has been pretty smooth tbh. I identified as a gay male for years (so I haven’t worn anything “straight” in a really long time) until fairly recently when I started wearing skirts, tights, lipstick, etc. My own hair is quite short and let’s say Frank Ocean-inspired. But I often wear long colourful wigs. Not all the time, but maybe 2-3 days of a week. My friends would see me wearing jeans and a tshirt one day to a dress another. Just for the record the femme clothes are not just a fashion statement but rather a signal of me feeling particularly feminine that day. Genderqueer/fluid is the closest label I can relate to. 

I live in a very liberal area of a liberal city. So far I had exactly zero problems with wearing whatever I want, even to work (I work in a casual attire environment with no real dress code). 

So it sounds like I can’t really complain, but when I am out by myself wearing something femme I always feel a little bit nervous. If I walk into a cafe and someone laughs loudly my first nervous thought is that it’s because my wig is slipping and I rush to the bathroom to double check. If the waiter is not particularly friendly (in my city it is very common for people to just start a friendly chat about the weather/the weekend/whatever) I fear it’s because they clock me and they don’t like what they see. 

The nervous feeling is still there even though I only ever hear positive comments, if anything, from strangers. Well surely not everyone is into my style, but at least nobody shouts the F worr at me - which I have experienced plenty in the city I was born in before I moved. 
Just the other day an old lady in the park joked she’s jealous of my legs, and a waitress said my outfit is on point. Basically there is nothing but positive reinforcement, but still I feel nervous. 

I feel safer if I’m “occupied” when out so I’m constantly smoking, looking at my phone (writing a reddit post...), or just rummaging in my bag for no real reason, so I have “something to do” when walking to look busy instead of having to look straight ahead. For whatever reason escaping in the little world of rummaging in my bag feels safer, but it’s pretty silly, and really I’m in constant danger of walking into a lampost. 

Do others have this feeling? Does it go away eventually? I imagine it does, first time I painted my nails I assumed the whole street is going to stare, and here we are two years later I don’t ever ever even think about my nails. Skirts and dresses are still relatively new thing for me and usually I wear those with out friends or just around the house. It’s only been a handful of times that I’ve dressed up very femme out and by myself.

2018-09-10 22:09:23,9ermkn,1,7,"I guess I should start off with a little background. I'm afab and have been medically transitioning for three years ago. When I initially started questioning five years ago I was coming from a more black and white thinking because that was all I was exposed to trans wise. I only had seen very few nonbinary people and had all these misconceptions of what one had to be in order to be binary trans (I even thought you had to be a certain sexuality). I had established myself as agender back then and felt guilty for even considering buying myself a binder back then (I really had no clue how diverse everyone's experience was then, I bought too much into the whole 'trans enough' nonsense). But when I realized that what I thought you needed to be and experience to be binary trans was false I started identifying as binary. I use to feel a lot more strongly about wanting to be seen as male and using he/him pronouns when hardly anyone ever saw me as anything but female. 

But after several months of medically transition I started to get he/him and even three years on sometimes I do feel weird about it and I don't know why. It doesn't make me feel uncomfortable, just weird. I grew my hair out because I kind of miss long hair and it was at this point in time I started getting shes and hers. I became frustrated and had my hair cut short (unfortunately shorter than I wanted) but...I kind of disliked how masc it made me look even though my girlfriend at the time (not knowing that I didn't like how masc it made me look) liked how masc it made me look. I kind of like it when I grow it out longer just like I kind of like it when I dress more androgynous rather than just plain masculine. 

But it's always kind of left me feeling complicated because I think why only after transition did I start feeling this way. I hate that I always have a nagging doubt at the back of my head questioning my transness despite having started my medical transition three years ago and have no real strong desire to be associated with womanhood or looking anything like I did pre medical transition. It doesn't help that I try to find other men who are more feminine but many times I discover they were just closeted about being trans. I have to remind myself that femininity is different for everyone, someone are just feminine even while some like to use femininity to express their feminine gender. But even then sometimes I don't feel welcome in spaces like that because I'm not amab even though I may have the same struggles they do now in terms of finding fit and appearing gnc.  

I still don't know what I want people to refer me as. I don't know why being referred to in male terms sometimes feel weird yet sometimes I feel indifferent and I just feel mostly embarrassed when people refer to me in female terms. Sometimes I just feel like a different breed of dude if that made any sense. I like the way I look though I hate the fact that when people read someone as male if they look little too androgynous they get read as a teen. But I can't really control what strangers read me as and never tried out any other pronouns because I feel I'd be too much of a hassle. I've never corrected anyone in my life.

anyway, im AFAB and questioning, and questioning my right to be questioning, which my logical, feminist brain tells me is some bullshit. please use your logical feminist brains to reassure the shitty part of mine? 

so yeah i have a ton of enby friends, always have.  i wrote that off as being open minded. but in becoming close to my enby friends i realized how much i empathize with them in tons of things. it really hit me when my one friend called me ""they"" as a slip, but then said ""oh sorry-- but you dont even care do you, when its gender"" and i realized that was true. i dont believe in gender being important besides as a vehicle to navigate a society which enforces norms based on it, and on the personal side that occurs as a direct result. 

but i did some introspection and yeah, it feels great to be ambiguous. i would say i always have been inclined to go back and forth between androgynous presentation and hyper-femme presentation, but i dont like the word androgynous to describe it because i feel 0% masculinity. for reference on how i present, im happy with long pink hair or a buzzcut,  combat boots or literal crinoline or both.   ive always had a complex relationship with my body, because some days i hate myself for looking like a 50 year old man (which i might not, judging on what people say to me) and sometimes for having softness and curve, which while obviously a feminine thing really fucks with my eating-disorder-brain. ive always felt equal connection with men, women, and enbies, though comfort with men is rare because men are scary.  

when i feel feminine, i feel very free, like a leaf on wind, like im unencumbered yet mysterious. i feel connected to the earth, to my mother and grandmother and ancestors, to other women. i feel protective and nurturing, seductive, delicate. 

when i feel neutral, i feel powerful and confident, very much like /i own myself/ and have the authority to assert as much. (i realize upon reading this that that should be how 'woman' feels too, but unfortunately, yknow) i feel like a raccoon or something-- clever and slick, elegant, dignified, resourceful. 

for the first time ever, i introduced myself tonight as she/they. it feels good being called they by accident, but ive never requested it before. i dont care what people see me as socially as long as its not a man-- this makes me worry that i am in some way lessening the experience of my trans and enby friends and comrades who /DO/ care more. their assertion of an identity means far more to them than mine does to me. i simply dont care. i hope that someone THIS cis-passing (a phrase i hesitate to even use because it affects me so little mentally too) using a neutral pronoun isnt harmful. thoughts?

T is going great! I feel amazing and myself, so that's nice. I'm starting to plan for the future and see what I want to or need to change as I start to look and sound different. 

I have a really cool feminine given name. I love the story behind it, how it sounds- it just feels so *me,* you know? However, in some spaces where I don't have time to really explain The Genders, I also go by my last name in situations where people don't need my full name, which is conveniently a common enough first name of many guys.

Between you all and I, I would probably be okay using my given name even when I look like a guy. I like to think that my name has no gender, it's *my* name and it's whatever *I* want it to be. However, I'm bracing myself for people misgendering me if they see my name before they see my face. (to explain, I'm nonbinary they/them, but I'm much better being read as male than female)

 Fuck this all. Why couldn't I have just been born a fucking boy. My life would have been so much better if the damn doctors just shouted 'it’s a boy!' instead of 'it’s a girl'. I'm just so fucking confused. It's like gender is a social construct anyway but I don’t fucking know. I'm just pissed off because no matter what I do I can't like myself and maybe it's because im actually a fucking boy in my fucked up brain. Or maybe I'm just a delusional girl wanting more fucking attention. All I know is that no matter what I do I hate myself. Because I always hate my hair no matter what and I'm awful at makeup and I don’t like dresses or skirts and like fuck. I'm already fucking gay, do I really have to be confused about everything there is to be confused about? Fuck man. I'm fucking terrified. Like, what if I am trans? It would just create so much more fucking stress and shit to transition but if I don’t and I'm trans I'll feel like shit but if it turns out I'm not trans after I come out as trans then im just a stupid attention seeking faker and I don’t even fucking know. I honestly just can't deal with this bullshit like im already fucking mentally ill, I'm fucking gay and of course now I might be trans. I really just want to fucking ignore it, just throw it away and leave it but the more I think about it the more signs that show and I don't know if I'm more terrified of not being trans after coming out or actually being fucking trans. I don’t want this shit okay. I just want to be your average cishet female. Or even better, cishet male. Why couldn't I have just been born fucking male? Why did I have to be a fucking girl? I hate it. I hate that society tells me I have to shav my legs and my armpits and to grow my hair long and to wear dresses and smell like flowers and never fart of fucking burp and be a fucking toy for men. I'm sick of being told to shut up and do what I'm told. I'm sick of being told not to waste my 'pretty' face. I fucking hate all of it. But on the other hand, I don’t have dysphoria. My trans/nb fried described dysphoria as like an intense feeling, you look in the mirror and you absolutely can't stand what it shows, you hate yourself so much you want to die, or cut of the offending body part. I don't get that. Like, I preferred my pre-pubescent flat chest and shit and like a dick would be much more convenient, but I don’t have an overwhelming hatred to the point where id grab a knife and cut my breasts off. I enjoy having short hair, but it wasn't overwhelming distress that led to it. And I'm terrified to talk to my nb/trans friend because if I turned out to be cis after all this, then im just a insensitive cis bitch romanticising trans and nb identities, I'm just a disgusting transphobe. And my heart is beating really fast now and I kinda wanna cry at the end of this rant and why does everything have to be a question, why does everything have to be confusing. Like fuck, I only just realised I don't actually want to kill myself, can we calm down a little on the fucking confusion for a while.

2018-09-13 10:58:19,9fgzig,1,8,"So, I’m at the point where I’m pretty sure I’m a trans woman or at least transfemme, though I still deal with a lot of doubt. I really feel like I want to do something about it, but I feel held back by the social issues of doing so. I live in a pocket of my mostly red state that can best be described as “centrist” on social issues, but there’s a fair bit of homogeny so harassment could become an issue. I also have a lot of family who I don’t think would understand and be accepting of this (although I almost never see them). I have been dealing with a great deal of anxiety that has caused me to become extremely withdrawn and isolated and to be visibly transitioning just seems like something that would make getting outside and interacting with people too difficult. 

I do want to try HRT though, like really badly, along with probably laser for my facial hair and save up for a hair transplant. I don’t know if this is realistic, but I thought about maybe binding to hide any potential breast growth and just not tell anyone besides my closest friends. I’m in my mid 30s now so I suspect the changes might not be so drastic anyway. I used to have my hair really long before it started receding, and I always kind of felt like being “mistaken” for a girl at the time was nice, but I don’t know if affirmation is something I feel I need all the time. I hear a lot of trans people talk about how painful it is to be misgendered, but I honestly feel mostly neutral about being referred to as a man. Likewise, dressing up in stereotypically feminine clothing and putting on makeup in private makes me feel great, but guy/neutral clothes in every day life doesn’t bother me all that much. This is part of what makes doubt ever-present. I mean, I am aware that with all my anxiety these things may be affecting me more than I realize, but I just can’t get passed the idea that visibly transitioning would be a worse alternative, all things considered. 

So yeah, I guess if maybe therapy and transitioning privately makes me feel better enough about myself I could consider being open about it, but for now I just feel like keeping it to myself and the people I trust most would be the only way I could stomach going through with it.

I'm a very physically large person (195cm and haven't been under 110kg in my adult life) and feel that I present very masculine with little that I can do about that. My face is all prominent nose, heavy brow ridge and strong jaw while any exercise I do gives me massive shoulders... etc...

&amp;#x200B;

I've been working on figuring this out for a while with very little success. In the past I have struggled to buy clothes due to poverty and just relying on buying cheap tees and pants from big budget brand stores where I can at least find things in my size. Most of my clothes are over 5 years old at a minimum...

&amp;#x200B;

Where I'm living currently there was a Pride rally today and I just couldn't face going because of an intense feeling of ""where do I stand?"" I didn't have anything that I felt that I could wear that would denote me as anything other than cishet male (I've put on some weight recently and clothes that I used to wear sometimes currently don't fit) and couldn't face the possibility of feeling completely invisible at such an event... or even being lumped together as what I've been struggling to move away from.

I don't know how to approach this at all because I don't have any answers. I don't know simple ways in which I can casually feminize my appearance. I'm trying to lose weight because currently I have a 44"" waist and can't find anything to wear that would make me feel ""attractive"". The photo attached was taken today as I left work because I couldn't take being seen by anyone like that any longer. The shirt in this photo was something I was given 7 years ago as part of a Secret Santa where I was working and I still wear it because it's still in one piece... x\_x

&amp;#x200B;

Help? Please?

(as a side note, I have at least some money now to be able to make changes)

So ive been confused about gender or a long while and kind of just been ignoring it. The issue for me is like i dont think i fit fully withing male or female. I do alot of gener non conforming things like crossdressing. Overall i really dont agree with gendering of things like items, jobs, roles, activities basically anything that isnt alive. 

That leads me to things. Because of that i dont really know where i fit bc i dont really get the societal definition of male. I also dont want to conform to what is expected of being a male bc i want to do everything male female or otherwise. Im just not sure. Like being a guy is fun but at the same time i dont really feel like that it. TBH it totally could be that im just a little out there and just a bit of a gender non conforming male.

2018-09-27 17:55:14,9jf3gz,1,8,"i’ve been unemployed for a bit and had an interview that i was excited about this morning. i’ve been a little concerned about how to handle gender stuff. i am dfab and present very neutrally—i’ve transitioned to cultivate a very androgynous look and i get gendered about 40-40-20 male/female/neutral by strangers, generally speaking. i’ve been on hrt before so my voice is on the higher side of what people expect to be a male register (think tracy chapman - brian molko range), and i primarily get gendered as male over the phone. interviewers always think i’m male bc they hear my voice (which is relatively deep) on the phone first and they’re like “ah yes a man” and then they see me irl and they’re like “hm…yes that’s…plausibly a man” and it kind of locks into place and then idk how to correct them.

i thought i dressed pretty neutrally for my interview today and i wasn’t even binding but the guy still called me sir and he. last time this happened i just rolled with it but i hated trying to pass every day and i think also i got soft fired for being Gender Confusing. i would prefer to be out as using they pronouns but that’s not feasible in every work environment and failing that i would at least like to pass as female i guess just for the sake of not having to wear a binder every day. but if they hear me on the phone and then i show up in a skirt or whatever i’m worried about being subjected to misdirected transmisogyny and not getting hired @____@ 

at my last job i never mentioned my gender id but i just dressed like normal and they kind of caught on to using they pronouns for me. (i live in the pnw and most people under the age of 35 or so are at least sort of familiar with trans people). at my last last job, i didn’t mention it either but i showed up to the interview dressed pretty masc and they just kind of assumed i was a guy and i went along with it, but i wasn’t making a significant effort to pass (didn’t wear a binder every day etc) and i’m pretty sure the reason i got soft fired is because this confused them. so i would like to avoid that happening again if at all possible, but i feel like there’s no good way to bring it up upon meeting someone and i don’t necessarily want to out myself to a stranger anyway. it’s rly rough out here! i’m legally nonbinary tho (i have an X gender marker on both my drivers license and birth certificate) and in my state gender id is a protected class, so i believe it would be illegal for them to fire me for coming out after i was hired, so maybe i should just roll with it until then and figure it out from there?? idk!

Maybe you have answered questions like this before, but I still would like to here from you:

&amp;#x200B;

I don't like labels, but the fact is, I am a male that is attracted to both females and males. Got it?

My female partner of 5 years is very non-judgmental and open minded, knows that I have quite a strong feminine aspect and that am a bit of a sub in the bedroom:)

However she is very much committed to monogamy, monogamy and only monogamy. 

I love her and I love our relationship and I don't want to change it or lose her.   
However I feel as though I have a raging inner non-binary, fluid and florid sexuality. I would love to put on a costume and Drag it out like some freaky alien sex pot from Elvendale. I mean all of that in a thoroughly positive light, so don't take  offence anyone!

I don't want to offend her, and actually feel a bit humiliated at the prospect of openly claiming any sort of fantasia-camp identity. I still like being a man with a woman. But I like it like *that,* too.
