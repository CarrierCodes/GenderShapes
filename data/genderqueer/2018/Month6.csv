2018-06-01 22:00:34,8nvv9i,9,4,"Hi guys, I just have a few questions about what it's like and what it means to identify outside of the male/female system. Please note that this isn't intended to 'disprove' other genders or anything like that, I'm just genuinely curious.

1. The way I define gender is as a means of identifying people based on social constructs \(as opposed to biological ones\). If this differs to your definition, why? If it doesn't, how are there sets of social constructs for all the new genders that haven't fully been introduced into our society?
2. This is only really directed towards the term 'transgender', although I've seen similar terms used. If transgender means that you have transitioned from one gender to another, does that not make your gender the gender you have transitioned to, rather than your gender being 'transgender'? For example, if you transitioned from female to male, wouldn't your gender be 'male' and 'transgender' would simply be a description?
3. I'm always open to changing my opinion, but I currently strongly reject the idea of identifying as non\-human. If you believe that it is genetic or has any other scientific backing, what's your reasoning for this? If you believe that it is a religious/spiritual concept then I think that just falls into the larger debate on the existence of spirits/deities.

So here is the thing, throughout my life starting at childhood, my dad would scold me about things men were supposed to do, and shouldn't do. One day this discussion was brought up while talking about denin colors. Back then it was very difficult to find any jeans that were not gray,blue,dark blue or black for boys/guys. I snapped and said to him ""I wish I was a girl so I don't have to worry about all these restrictions."" That was when he smacked me and said never to say that again.


Fast forward nearly 18 years later, those remarks that he made to me still haunt me everyday that I wake up. They make me feel like shit, and up until I met my current girlfriend I suppressed my desires. It turns out that I actually enjoy wearing women's clothing to an extent. I would love to wear a skirt on a hot summer day because Jeans or shorts are too hot. I would love to wear dresses or night gowns in my house at night, i would even enjoy wearing leggings if given the chance. I've opened up to my girlfriend about it, but she is very reluctant to think its acceptable to do so. I told her how my father made me feel and how I still feel today, but she feels as though she has to act more masculine since I want to wear more feminine clothing. 

I basically broke it down to her and said ""If we were single, and I was trying to ""bag"" another woman, it would make it harder on myself  if I approached them in a dress. However if i got to meet them and we fell in love with eachother and then I showcased my interest in wearing women clothing, I would feel like the social stigmas dont apply anymore because who cares what others think if youre not trying to pursue them. You still love me for me at this point so it doesnt matter how I dress because I'm not trying to impress society. The ""game"" is over, now we can be ourselves and our masks can come off.

Yesterday we went shopping and I found a croptop, the first croptoo I ever purchased in my life. I THOUGHT this is my moment, I gotta get it and its only $8, whats to lose? I tried it on and wore it out to dinner and didnt give two fucks about anyone's opinion. Today, she told me she didnt like what I did and would not like me to wear women's cloths outside again.

This is a very frustrating point in my life. I'm a straight male that just likes getting in touch with my feminine side. It has nothing to do with my orientation so I don't see why she is getting so upset over it. Every discussion we have always lead to her basically trying to say I don't want to be male. I can't change what I am at birth but the one thing I did learn about being a guy is that once you're an adult you shouldn't have to adhere to any rules as long as its not harming anyone.

I am a binary trans guy who is dating an AFAB non binary partner. I am seeking help because as of late, my partner's feelings of dysphoria and frustration with the binary has been getting worse and worse. 

Obviously, I am trans and can relate to their general feelings of dysphoria, but I feel like because I am binary, I cannot fully relate to their frustrations.

To make things worse, their upbringing was highly religious (ofc lol) and when they were very young, told their parents that they were a boy... Which then led to their parents questioning them at a very young age about it. Which of course, went terribly.

I feel so bad and helpless.. I share my experiences with them and reassure them that there's nothing wrong with being trans and that they're totally fine the way they are, but they are still doubting themselves.

To make things worse, we've been trying to get them a therapist for MONTHS now. Ugh. No fucking luck. It has been a struggle.

I love them very much and want them to know that I support them and care about them, but I feel like I'm not doing enough/could be doing more?

Ugh, I don't know. I just wish they could work on accepting themselves and loving them for who they are: an amazing nonbinary person.

Last night and this morning, I stayed up trying to configure a DIY gaffe, figuring out how to use it, and researching basically everything related to AMAB binding after a fellow nonbinary pal discussed their experiences with it. After a few tries, I made a competent gaffe from an old black tube sock and a pajama waistband; I was determined to try this out, after weeks of intensified \(fluctuating\) genital dysphoria. 

I realized that a lot of stuff out there related to AMAB binding talked a lot about ""tucking"", or sliding the testicles up into the inguinal hole. This scares the living shit out of me, as I've always had an antsy relationship with my balls, and messing with them seems....eh.

So what I did \(for about half of the day\) was placed my gaffe over my underwear, essentially flattening the look of the pelvic area; but I could never tuck, it was just too ech for me. 

Throughout the day, I re\-adjusted when the compression was either causing discomfort \(ie too tight/weird\), or was too camel\-toey \(ie not firm enough\). When noon came around, I decided to call that friend I referenced earlier, due to uncertainty about all this. They seemed to think that compression could actually be more physically dangerous than tucking, and when I talked about being uncomfortable with tucking, they seemed to be unsure about it all. 

There is so little research about the harms of these techniques, and I can't seem to get anyone to speak \(anecdotally or medically\) to the affects of occasional compression without tucking, the one that I kinda liked a lot.

I am AFAB and I am currently identifying as genderqueer/fluid. 

I wouldn't say I am *unhappy* as a girl, but I feel restricted by the assumption that I am a certain way cos I have tits.

It's not even about ""people expect me to act a certain way because I am a girl"" it's that people expect me to act a certain way because I have the SEXUAL characteristics of a woman,
so they assume that is what I am, or like, at least, that's the EXTENT of my identity?
If that makes sense?

I feel like people see tits and go ""That is a woman. Gonna treat this person like a woman. They must act like the woman I view them as or they are weird and not a good woman!"" 

Is the way I feel, as a trans/NB person, based on the description above, social dysphoria, or just me being a cis woman trying to break the barriers of gender roles?

I have this feeling of ""wanting to be trans"" because I am scared to be cis now that I have opened this can of worms, and I feel a lot of anxiety around the whole ""am I cis?"" question.  

I am really struggling with depressed and suicidal moods since I began questioning my gender and am honestly just reaching out for validation.

2018-06-08 06:28:04,8phof6,22,9,"Hello, I'm currently really confused about gender. I keep on going back and forth between ""I'm cis"" and ""Wait, but why isn't *everyone* genderqueer?""! I was wondering if the community on here could therefore clear a few things up for me.

I'm AFAB, and the main thing that got me wondering about gender was that I really wanted a flat chest. This made me wonder a bit since I *also* have anorexia, and the way in which I view my body is undoubtedly affected by it, so I'm not sure if it's just a product of my ED and shouldn't have anything to do with gender identity. However, I do remember feeling disappointed when I got breast development, or something, and that was before my eating disorder.

I don't have any discomfort about the other parts of my body, I guess, if only partially due to the fact that I lost weight due to an eating disorder and that it's ""easier"" to look androgynous at a thinner weight. I don't care about my periods since for me it is more of a medical thing to me. I never really understood it as ""it's part of being a woman"" or something and always thought the statement to be rather comical—like, why should I care about being a ""woman"" or something.

I'm actually quite feminine in terms of personality. I don't like sports, and I like cute things. I like feminine clothing like dresses and leggings. Clearly, these things don't determine my gender identity since they're just personality. However, they're probably the main things that keep me using she/her and identifying as female/a girl—the fact that I am AFAB and it'd be useful in a medical sense and the fact that the places specific to my interests such as r/femalefashionadvice are mainly populated by women and girls.

To be honest, I'm not even sure what the difference is between being nonbinary/genderqueer and being cis since I don't think that most people really think about their gender identities—clearly, not everyone's genderqueer/NB. I guess for me, I don't feel comfortable being included in ""the girls"" or ""the guys""—but it might just be because of sexism, like the fact that I don't want to be part of any gendered group due to the stereotypes.

To be honest, I (and I hesitate to link these articles since they're controversial) don't know how to resolve certain mental conflicts. I think I've read this argument that nonbinary can't exist innately, like it's just a political label since all NB people tend to be leftist, or something. Or that it's just a fad. I'm definitely not saying that I'm agreeing, but I'm just not sure how to mentally process this. -_-;;

2018-06-09 15:47:11,8ptnax,34,43,"So like, there are obvious reasons why I like hanging out in trans and nonbinary communities. I am trans and nonbinary! I have gotten huge amounts of support, insight, and guidance from fellow trans and nonbinary people, including from binary trans people. I also like banding together with people to work on common goals.

I feel a tension though sometimes in that if I interact too much with highly dysphoric trans people, my own dysphoria gets worse.

I think I am a very empathetic person and I am very affected by others feelings, and that may play a role. I also feel some degree of social pressure, especially in binary trans communities, in the form of people being more likely to see me as ""legitimately trans"" if I have dysphoria (or have greater dysphoria). In extreme cases this plays out in terms of negativity or exclusion directed at me, but more often it's more subtle -- people seeming to focus on the topic of dysphoria.

For me, my dysphoria sometimes gets worse from talking about it. It usually gets better when I'm thinking more abstractly and more rationally.

Also, sometimes I feel like certain trans and nonbinary people are propagating ideas or ways of thinking that I consider to be characteristic of mental disorder, including depression, anxiety, and sometimes other disorders. As someone who has struggled intensely with depression in the past, and to some degree with anxiety, it is very hard for me to be exposed to these perspectives. I find this a problem in left-wing subcultures in general, that there is a tendency for certain ideas to circulate which I feel vulnerable to. And this interacts with dysphoria, because for me, the worse my mental illness is, the more likely I am to experince dysphoria more strongly.

I have found that bringing these topics up often doesn't go well. People often get defensive and often attack me. Mental illness and mental health can be a very touchy subject, and I feel like I'm often put in the impossible position of (a) feeling negatively affected by certain ideas and wanting to challenge them (b) having other people be personally vested in those ideas and take offense personally and often attack me if I do challenge them.

An idea would be when people advance the idea that hormonal transition is the only or best way to treat certain types of dysphoria. For me, believing this idea makes me feel worse, because there are certain reasons I do not want to pursue hormonal transition, so this makes me feel hopeless if I start buying into this. But when I argue with this idea, people sometimes take it personally. I don't like dealing with this sort of conflict and negativity, and it often makes me just want to leave the trans communities where this sort of dialogue is taking place.

I am curious if these struggles or experiences resonate with anyone, and also, if people have any tips or advice for how to navigate this stuff more gracefully. I tend to have a very thin skin emotionally, I am very sensitive and I often don't know how to insulate myself from the emotional effects of some of this stuff.",genderqueer,Dysphoria Made Worse by Trans and Some Nonbinary Communities,1528584431.0,"{'created_utc': 1528559231, 'id': '8ptnax', 'num_comments': 34, 'score': 43, 'selftext': 'So like, there are obvious reasons why I like hanging out in trans and nonbinary communities.

I took a good month to really think about what I wanted and find out what other people have done to lessen period symptoms. 10 years ago, when I first went on the pill, I was a hormonal teenager going through a lot of life lessons. After I rage quit the pill, I upheld the belief that the hormonal birth control pill was a negative influence on my life.

I changed my belief because I realized that hormonal birth control was the best short-term fix to the gender dysphoria I was experiencing and decided to give myself a year on the pill to see what happened.

**Month 1 of pill**

I started Altavera (0.15mg Levonorgestrel and 0.03mg Ethinyl Estrodiol) a few weeks after I got the prescription at Planned Parenthood right after my next period ended.

On the first day of the pill, I was still spotting a little from my period. Then I had 4 glorious normal days. Unfortunately, I had spotting on the 6th to 21st day on the pill. I knew this was a part of the challenge because my body was getting used to a new substance. I had a bad cold and a few other health issues during the first month so I can't say much for symptoms other than the spotting.

The period was hilarious, day 1 off the pill I had spotting, then 1.5 days of a light period, 1.5 days of spotting, and 2 days normal. It was weird, but I accepted it and let my mind dive head first into the belief that I would not have any more spotting like I did the first month.

**Month 2 of pill**

I am now on day 10 of my second pill pack and have not had any spotting! It feels great, I feel normal and I intend to attract good energy to keep this lack-of-a-streak going. I'm really optimistic about the next few months on the 21-day on pill 7-day off cycle while my body adjusts.

Some of the symptoms other than spotting that I have noticed and attribute only to the new hormones in my body include noticeably larger breasts, occasional nausea, and increased sex drive.

My breasts are now a little under a half size bigger than they were before because of the hormones. This isn't a big deal to me, but I wanted to list this off for anyone else who might not want that.

The nausea is unlike anything I've felt before. I've sure had nausea before but this feeling isn't like the other types. I get a little dizzy, a bit more tired, and very sensitive to moving my body. It lasts a few minutes up to a few hours. When it's short, like it was just a little bit ago, it feels like I'm hungry but I'm not hungry and usually has a bigger wave of dizziness. When it lasts longer than 30 minutes, it's constant but with less dizziness and I need to stay in the same spot until it passes. These episodes, short and long, happen around 4 times a week and I don't think they're triggered by anything. But they are getting better with time.

The increased sex drive is a little bit annoying. I don't have any sexual issues right now but it kinda sucks to get really horny in the middle of the workday. Nobody else is complaining about this symptom :)

**Future Plans**

I understand that the pill is going to mess with my body for at least another month or two. Once I feel my body is used to the hormones, probably 4-6 months into the prescription, I intend to start combining pill packs to have a period every 6 weeks and see how my body responds.

I feel very strongly that my body needs to go through periods every once in a while, and my aim with the pill and my dysphoria is to reduce period symptoms, flow, length, and feel like I have more control over a part of my life I've hated since it started.

Long-term I am looking into getting a hysterectomy or pursuing other medical treatment so that I am not on the pill for too many years. This is a temporary fix to a larger problem that I need time to work through, and I'm glad this option is starting to work out well for me.

I've known I'm agender since I was probably 6 or 7, but didn't know the word until I was around 12, and I've identified that way ever since.
Anyway enough about that

My bottom dysphoria didn't used to be too bad. As of late, honestly, it's almost as bad as my chest dysphoria (which is overwhelming most days). I pack a lot of the time, and I know I'd much rather have a penis than what I currently have, but even the idea of that makes me dysphoric. It's just
An improvement.
Really, what I want (and what ive wanted for years) is to have no genitals (also cw for genital terminology coming up)
whatsoever, and I know that's the only way to erase any bottom dysphoria I have.
Problem is, again, the afab thing.
I've seen minimal information on things like this for amab people, and I've seen absolutely none regarding afab people.
I know I could look into a vaginectomy and clitorectomy (not sure what the procedure is to deal with the labia).
To my knowledge though, this is considered FGM in western countries, so I'm not sure how I would even find a surgeon to do it.

Even if I successfully found a surgeon, I don't want to imagine the cost (im poor and i grew up poor. I literally cannot afford something like this if insurance wont cover it), and I cant even ensure that it would be aesthetically pleasing (or even possible) given that all results ive seen are from amab people.

2018-06-19 21:19:22,8sclbq,2,10,"one day in 2014, a friend asked me “are you sure you want to be with her, or maybe do you want to be her?”

i thought about it for a few minutes and i realised the second thing was as true as the first. the moment i admitted/realized this, the past reconfigured itself like in the movies, and i recalled a lot of things i stopped thinking about.

as a child, i liked girls a lot. meaning i wanted to be like them. i looked at them and it felt like they had many more possibilities than boys. in dresses, in games, in feelings. i was comfortable with my delicacy, my fragility, i liked to be like that. my parents never tried to “correct” me. i didn’t feel wrong, weird, i was simply me. and happy.

i looked like a girl. “what a lovely girl you have”, people told my mother. i loved it.

as a teen i retained an androgynous beauty. i kept feeling tightly confined in the boy role. i remember one time when i was 13. there was a team game and my team decided to make it a music show: i was to be the valletta (italian term to describe the girl usually \*helping\* the male host in tv shows… i know).

i jumped at the opportunity. i put on heels, a short dress, make up. everyone started to compliment me, telling me what a beautiful girl and stuff like that. i felt great, i loved this kind of unusual attention, and i loved looking in the mirror. the show was about to start when the boy playing the male host wanted to dance with me. i just said “no” i did not like boys, i liked girls. and i also liked to be one, that night.

it felt so incredibly special, and right.

then puberty hit.  
suddenly i looked in the mirror and i saw someone different.  
my body, and especially my face, had changed.  
i could not see a girl anymore, i would not ever be like that night again.   
I felt a little sad, but being pragmatic i just said to myself “ok, i’m a male. stop”

and i really stopped looking inside, for a long time.

and then boom. that question in 2014.  
suddenly i saw things take new shape and meaning.  
my eternal struggle with “typical male behaviour”. trying to avoid at all costs to go out in all males groups.  
the eternal annoyance about what is considered male and what female.  
the very strong discomfort towards my body, but also towards the concrete possibilities to change it (i swear, if one day i wake up with a six-pack i will immediately go to drink some drain cleaner).

now i’m like this, confused. alien inside myself. but an alien i’m used to.

there are so many choices, i could say i’m agender, trans, genderfluid, i could… i’m not really interested in labels, but i would really like to understand myself better.

i thought about it, i don’t think transition is for me, or trying to pass and such things. of course if i could snap my fingers and become anna karina, i would do that right now. but operations… no.   
and with my appeareance, i don’t think that would work at all. i look good enough as a man, i would not look like i feel as a woman. maybe i’m shallow.

but i’m finding more and more frustrating to let people see me as a man “stop”.

i’m thinking about nail polish, about eyliner, about… i don’t know, i’m also shy so thinking to attract attention it’s another problem in this loving and accepting society (yes, it’s sarcasm).

but if i stay like this what am i? a fake? i don’t really know. i’m afraid to feel or be made to feel like an impostor in queer spaces. do i worry too much?

i would like to hear some thought about it. of course i don’t want you to decide what’s my identity.  
but i’m just so damn confused that reading something not generated in my head maybe could help.

i know this was long af, so if no one will have the patience to get to the end, i will understand. i think in part i just needed to vent. i can take it.

But I wanted to just post about a couple of things pertaining to today. So here they are, probably scrambled and messy.

First up is that today is a special day for me. Two years ago to this day (ie last Wednesday of June) was the day I discovered what non-binary meant...

Well I mean I knew what non-binary meant. It's a pretty simple word. ""Not associated or connected to a binary system."" It's more that this day was the day I realised what it meant in context to gender. Now I can't say that I immediately dropped all pretense and leapt into the NB pool. It took me another month of digging, researching and self-reflecting before I got there but today was the day the fireworks were lit. The day my brain was introduced to the thing I'd been missing all these years. A way to explain all my quirks regarding my own gender growing up. It was the light that let me explore myself. So I'd like to thank whoever wrote that awful trash of a fanfic for just dumping the concept there in the first two paragraphs. (also don't ask for the name of it, it was tripe - bad grammar, no concern for story structure and thin characters)

Next I'd like to say thanks.

To all of you.

To everyone who's brave enough to post pictures of themselves here (yes it's a safe space for us but it still takes some courage) in all your queer glory.

To everyone who gifts us with a new story to read, to relate to and to discuss.

To everyone who comes here seeking comfort for the woes and aches they feel in the outside world... and for all of those who do their utmost to reassure them that they *are not alone*.

To those who come seeking information, about themselves, their children or their loved ones. Or even just to understand our plights and joys.

To all of you.

Thanks so much for making these last (almost) two years of my life full of hope and joy.


Last thing. Going through my phone to find a gif of an exploding head (makes sense in context shut up) I was pleasantly surprised.

I got my new phone early last year and I am so glad that there isn't a single picture or representation of me on it that doesn't scream ""Trans!"" It's nice to see that despite the doubts of those surrounding me sometimes that I haven't wavered in my commitment to myself these last two years.

Again Thank You All and here's hoping for many more  great years spent exploring ourselves.

Instead, she went through the typical radfem gymnastics of talking about society as a whole:  
&gt; how nonbinary expression threw the ""poor normal people"" as normies under the bus. How it makes them look bad for not drinking the cool aid?? How they get forced to conform to the minority?

&gt;(gaslighting lies about transsexual allies, appeal to historical cishet stories, sufragettes surely must be nonbinary, gender is definition wordsalad, etc etc)
