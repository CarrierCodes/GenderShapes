I don't... really know how to go about this. I'm AFAB and still trying to figure things out. I found that as soon as my friends swapped pronouns for me, I started disliking hearing my old pronouns really quickly. My name has started to feel uncomfortable too but I'm really unsure about finding a new name. Part of me wants to learn more about transitioning options for a nonbinary oriented person... but I'm also scared of rushing into it and overwhelming myself. I don't usually get dysphoria as long as I stay away from feminine makeup and tight clothes. (I think? I have top-dysphoria? Because I'm not even fully joking when I say I want to get rid of my chest? I've never liked my chest ever since puberty.) 

I have this awful creeping fear that I might be invalid because I'm in my early twenties and maybe I'm too late. I figured out my sexuality in highschool, so it makes me kind of mad that I took this long. But it makes sense too because I didn't have the language for it until recently when I started to finally see stuff about genderfluid and nonbinary people. (Thank you, Thomas Sanders and tumblr)

The only thing I know for sure is I really like being called they/them and the word genderqueer felt really right as soon as I used it for myself.

It was like 4 months ago, I did get my T and it's been just fine, but socially transitioning is hell. Literally hell on Earth and I just want not to be trans. I am always overwhelmed by intrusive thoughts about how I'm just a girl pretending to be a boy (I'm afab) and that I'm gonna regret doing all of this, that I'm gonna fail and I'll never be a man because, well, to our society men have penises and I don't. I'm so fucking tired, because my SO supports me, but we live in my grandparents' house and can't afford to get out and they keep missgendering me (I go by he/him in portuguese/eng and they/them/eng) and calling me by my birth name and all the neighbors call me by that... It's been too fucking much and in a short amount of time. I am having anxiety attacks, vomiting and all that is making me want to kill myself. But ofc I don't have the courage to do it.

2018-04-04 04:53:50,89milg,5,6,"Hi all,

I'm not sure whether I am genderqueer or not, as all the lingo kinda goes over my head.

This is a bit about my background:
I was born with a male-assigned gender.
Growing up I felt comfortable and normal doing things that were traditionally femme like figure skating, wearing skirts, etc. And as an adult I take any excuse to wear make-up, paint my nails, etc. and it feels totally fine.

 I'm empathetic and a relationship builder. I don't feel particularly masculine.

I don't think I'm a cross-dresser because when I wear ""women's"" clothes or do makeup, my goal isn't to look like a woman. I just like it, and I do what I do. 

Any guidance on what a suitable term could be?

2018-04-06 21:25:50,8ad8u3,16,0,"I posted this on a couple other subreddits but haven’t really gotten a response and I’m interested in thoughts.

I have always considered myself an open minded and easy going person. I have many friends in the LGBTQ community because I have always chosen to judge people on their actions and words as opposed to their personal life choices, this always included using the preferred pronouns of others. However, in the past couple of years my relationships seem to becoming strained by the political climate surrounding gender. I have always used the proper pronouns because I am a decent human being but that doesn’t mean I necessarily conform to their world views, just that it doesn’t hurt me to address them politely and if I like them as a person I don’t really care. 

Recently however it seems as though that is not enough and society to a large extent seems to be making a push to impose this worldview onto others. Maybe I’m wrong, I don’t know, but I see this as problematic for many reasons, mainly with it’s relation to empiricism and the overall well being of social understanding between individuals. Because of my views I’ve been called ignorant, transphobic, and bigoted, none of which is true. I’ve thought very long and hard on this because I always try to be impartial and reasoned when coming to a conclusion. I’ve read texts, articles, medical research, the whole nine yards. In the end I am a very logic and fact based thinker and after everything I think I’ve figured out what my issues with the recent social movement are.

Gender as an idea outside the bounds of physical sex was first developed by a psychologist as a way to attempt to describe those with Gender Dysphoria formerly known as Gender Identity Disorder. It is impossible to separate from physiology for that reason. People who truly have this condition do not simply see behaving in traditionally feminine ways with regards to gender norms or being called “she” as a fix to the problem, they experience extreme emotional distress with their physical bodies. 

This is why transitioning is such a big part of the trans experience for most today, simply adjusting the ways we relate with gender norms and pronouns is not enough. Sometimes, in rare instances, we even see cases where a male who identifies as female transitions to female and still continues to act in traditionally male ways, even retaining their attraction to women. This creates a dissonance with the idea that gender is truly a fluid emotional state because it was developed as a concept and is intrinsically tied to our physical bodies with how it relates to our feelings with regards to these issues.

Rather than, from the gender theory perspective, attempting to alter the way we apply empiricism and language in definitions, would it not be more productive to instead simply acknowledge gender norms are social constructs and therefore should not be given as much weight? If we were all to one day suddenly say a guy can act in traditionally female ways and be attracted to boys but that isn’t wrong, would that change the severe emotional distress inherent with transgenderism and their bodies? No.

This is why gender studies is not even a soft science like sociology, it is filled with thinking errors, justifications and double speak. If we say the body does not have a part in defining gender, and then we say all experiences are subjective and we can’t truly understand the feelings of another outside our personal views (one of their key arguments), then that means it is truly impossible for a person to just “feel” like a girl because they have no objective way of knowing how girls “feel”. This means it is inextricably tied to the physical body or perceived gender norms. 

Gender fluidity, non-binary, gender queer, these are all just words that seem to be used to convolute what it biologically means to be a man, woman, or all of the various birth abnormalities such as hyper androgyny or Klinesfeters through social perception. *Note, abnormality is not bad, just statistically unusual. We generally assign genders or even allow them to decide later on because as a society we are aware they do not fit cleanly into the binary. Assigning or allowing them to choose IS ACCEPTING them into normal society by not consistently pointing out that they are different. I understanding wanting to prevent alienation by saying there is no such thing as normal but with relation to statistical relevance I can’t disregard the existence of normalized biological states. To a certain extent I feel like pretending otherwise, at least in my mind, is almost patronizing. Rather than pretending it’s something it’s not we should just accept that person and whatever their choices may be. 

I think all these labels, in essence, are not only a fetishization of the trans experience, but they actually reinforce gender norms by saying actions and behaviors define who you are, therefore necessitating different terms to describe the behaviors. This means if you identify as a non-gender queer man, your actions would be limited to a certain array if you did not want to obscure your sense of self by behaving in non-traditional ways. If you do you’re queer but perhaps you do not perceive yourself as being “other”. So if labels are meant to be descriptive of the individuals feelings as well it is possible multiple people could all behave the same and have the same sex but identify different in terms of their label which eliminates even the meaning of the label. What determines which label you fit and how can we say how it feels to be a label if different people subjectively feel different about the label? In other words, it is applying an extreme amount of significance to something that is in fact, rather insignificant and oppressive in the idea that labels can give meaning to behavior or feelings or vice versa.

This is the inherent flaw in a fundamentally philosophical argument that more or less exploits sociological principles to make it’s points while at the same time shutting down opposition to the double speak in their arguments through coercion as opposed to reason.

I have the utmost sympathy for those who have Gender Dysphoria and will absolutely call them by their pronouns because I’m aware it is a condition that there is no current treatment for as an adult, if they TRULY have Gender Dysphoria. As it stands, 96% of people who identify as trans when pre-pubescent come to accept their bodies by the time they become teenagers. Instead, rather than trying to work with these children’s to help them understand their sexuality, because these people are almost always homosexual in orientation, now we’re telling them that they can be the opposing sex if they want. Beta blockers, hormone therapy, sex reassignment surgery, these are all incredibly invasive and generally irreversible treatments. When we can improve the emotional well being of a person and help them to accept themselves we should whenever possible as opposed to enabling a fundamental misunderstanding of self that leads to irreversible medical procedures.

I think gender studies needs to stop co-opting science and undermining empiricism in it’s assertions and instead focus on inclusion and acceptance as opposed to developing theories which convolute our perceptions of each other. We can all accept and respect each other while acknowledging behaviors are simply behaviors without having to tear down the principles of biological understanding itself. We can all accept the trans experience and incorporate them into society through understanding and inclusion without having to fundamentally tear down the relation between objectivity and subjectivity or undermining the scientific method.",genderqueer,Feeling Conflicted,1523075150.0,"{'created_utc': 1523049950, 'id': '8ad8u3', 'num_comments': 16, 'score': 0, 'selftext': 'I posted this on a couple other subreddits but haven’t really gotten a response and I’m interested in thoughts.\n\nI have always considered myself an open minded and easy going person.

To a certain extent I feel like pretending otherwise, at least in my mind, is almost patronizing. Rather than pretending it’s something it’s not we should just accept that person and whatever their choices may be. \n\nI think all these labels, in essence, are not only a fetishization of the trans experience, but they actually reinforce gender norms by saying actions and behaviors define who you are, therefore necessitating different terms to describe the behaviors. This means if you identify as a non-gender queer man, your actions would be limited to a certain array if you did not want to obscure your sense of self by behaving in non-traditional ways. If you do you’re queer but perhaps you do not perceive yourself as being “other”. So if labels are meant to be descriptive of the individuals feelings as well it is possible multiple people could all behave the same and have the same sex but identify different in terms of their label which eliminates even the meaning of the label. What determines which label you fit and how can we say how it feels to be a label if different people subjectively feel different about the label? In other words, it is applying an extreme amount of significance to something that is in fact, rather insignificant and oppressive in the idea that labels can give meaning to behavior or feelings or vice versa.\n\nThis is the inherent flaw in a fundamentally philosophical argument that more or less exploits sociological principles to make it’s points while at the same time shutting down opposition to the double speak in their arguments through coercion as opposed to reason.\n\nI have the utmost sympathy for those who have Gender Dysphoria and will absolutely call them by their pronouns because I’m aware it is a condition that there is no current treatment for as an adult, if they TRULY have Gender Dysphoria. As it stands, 96% of people who identify as trans when pre-pubescent come to accept their bodies by the time they become teenagers. Instead, rather than trying to work with these children’s to help them understand their sexuality, because these people are almost always homosexual in orientation, now we’re telling them that they can be the opposing sex if they want. Beta blockers, hormone therapy, sex reassignment surgery, these are all incredibly invasive and generally irreversible treatments. When we can improve the emotional well being of a person and help them to accept themselves we should whenever possible as opposed to enabling a fundamental misunderstanding of self that leads to irreversible medical procedures.\n\nI think gender studies needs to stop co-opting science and undermining empiricism in it’s assertions and instead focus on inclusion and acceptance as opposed to developing theories which convolute our perceptions of each other. We can all accept and respect each other while acknowledging behaviors are simply behaviors without having to tear down the principles of biological understanding itself. We can all accept the trans experience and incorporate them into society through understanding and inclusion without having to fundamentally tear down the relation between objectivity and subjectivity or undermining the scientific method.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Feeling Conflicted', 'created': 1523075150.0}"

2018-04-08 21:38:27,8at9py,8,11,"Lately, since when I saw some photos of a trans boy which made me think: “This is freaking cool, I wonder if I’d like this...?”, I have been thinking about my gender identity a lot.
Yeah, at first I was very confused and also scared and worried about the whole thing; then I started to read stories and to pick up some information, and my feelings about the picture of that trans boy became more and more similar to a: “I wish I could do so too”.

However, I am writing this because right now I feel very uncomfortable with my boobs. They really annoy me, I got this feeling which makes me want to cut them off, like an itch I cannot scratch.
I have already felt like this before and I thought it was normal, but now that I am thinking deeply about my gender identity this feeling is getting worse and very annoying. Then I thought, is this some kind of gender dysphoria?
I have been loathing girly clothes, makeup, girly games and girly whatever since childhood – even if occasionally I’ve obviously tried to fit into society standards (for example trying to get into dolls, or to have nice Instagram posts like my popular girly classmates who looked so chill and happy all the time), feeling like I was betraying myself, but since I was a child I didn’t go any further. I also feel uneasy when people call me by my first name, by female pronouns, or “girl”; while I feel excited when my friends tell me the only thing between being male and me is a penis, and this kind of things.
Anyway, even though I have never identified as a girl, I have also never felt this uncomfortable with my body til now. Could dysphoria be born just now? Or is it that I have noticed it just now?

Before I used to identify as none; more specifically I just identified as a person because I used to reject any kind of label. But now I want to get to know myself much better than now, then I’ll rely also on labels at least for the beginning. To understand.
Anyway, I just used to think that gender doesn’t matter: we all are just people. I do like to be masculine, but it’s true that boys can put makeup on and still be boys, then I used to be content with that.
But now that I stopped to think about my feelings thoroughly and to value myself way more, I got I am actually unpleasant looking like a girl and I’d just love to be a boy.
I have also realized I could actually turn into a boy if I wanted, and now that it appears like a real and natural possibility to my eyes, then I am even surer about what I am feeling. Even if I am still a bit confused and totally scared.
Lately I have also started to be willing to express myself in my uniqueness, since I have always kept myself to myself (get me), then repressed everything I am because I have always been weird comparing to those around me. And this “boy thing” is in the picture. I’d just love to be a boy, that’s it. And right now I am feeling uncomfortable because of my female body, it’s very annoying, I wonder if I’ll be able to fall asleep with this itch I cannot scratch.

I was assigned male at birth. Eventually accepted I was a crossdresser, realized it was more and labled myself bigender, then eventually labled myself a transwoman. I identified as a trans woman for quite some time, maybe around 9 months or so? Recently I've been feeling masculine identification coming back and ive actively wanted to experience it again. It hasn't been distressing in any way except for the fact that I'm now requestioning my gender identity. I have an appointment to start hormones at the end of the month and now I'm not entirely sure if that's right for me, but I'm still going to start them and see how it feels. I'm currently in a place where I really want to know for sure what my gender identity is but I've accepted that all I can know is how I feel day to day and maybe one day I'll have a concrete answer. 

Even when I was identifying as transfemme, saying I was a woman sounded a little off. I know for sure I'm not cisgender and so I don't think these feelings of masculinity are coming from a place of internalized transphobia. I'm currently exploring the fluidity of my gender or if I'd fit better in my own gender that is a combination of things from both sides of the spectrum. Even recently both my female and male names have just sounded like of off, and a more neutral name like Taylor or Alex is appealing to me. I'm the type of person who, when I find something new that I like, I dive into it 110%. Which makes me think that I identified as transfemme because the feminine side of me was a new experience and I wanted all of it. Now that I've lived that way for a while I'm thinking I might be getting back to baseline and actually fall somewhere in between or outside the gender spectrum.

So for those of you who are gender fluid, bigender, or non-binary, what is it like? How did you know?

It may be important to add that I openly present anywhere along the male to female spectrum, sometimes wanting to be closer to one side than the other. Even at the height of feeling femme, I was very happy just presenting femme in public and didn't really have an inner desire to have my body be that of a woman's. Generally I can be pretty happy in a mixed state, so like combining male and female clothing, while wearing makeup and nail polish and using my male voice or having some stubble. 

In terms of the effects from hormones my main desire would be less body hair and better skin, but breasts are fully neutral to me with no appeal or dislike.

I'm sure many of you could guess from the title, but whether I'm trans or something along the lines of bigender or gender neutral is something I've been trying to figure out for myself. I've had issues with dysphoria since puberty at the very latest. I went through a lot of the same stuff I imagine a lot of trans people did. I discovered tg fiction / porn and was content telling myself I just had a fetish for boys being turned into girls for most of high school and university. Eventually I accepted that I had some real issues with dysphoria but still didn't even consider transitioning. I think one of the reasons for this is because I've never really felt like I disliked being a man, just that being a (particularly a very feminine) woman really appealed to me. Over the past couple months I've been getting more real with myself. I've definitely accepted that I'm not a cis man, but I haven't really done anything with that information. I don't really feel like ids such as gender neutral or any of your box standard gender non-con identities really speak to me. But at the same time it doesn't feel super important that I label myself in that way. Right now I think I'm fine with masculine pronouns and people seeing me / treating me as a cis man as long as I know for myself I'm not cis. Basically I've felt determining that I wasn't cis was good enough for now.

Recently though I've stumbled across some of the trans / gender non conforming related subreddits, from the more serious ones like this to the more shitposty ones like r/traa and r/egg_irl and after lurking for a few days I really feel like I identify with a lot of the sentiments on here. I've historically acted and felt in ways that are considered ""eggy"" and the idea of being a woman certainly does appeal to me, but at the same time I really don't feel like I dislike my current body and self. Being a masculine non-cis person really doesn't bother me too much. It does sometimes, but at other times I'm perfectly happy with it and I really don't know if I've just persuaded myself I'm not trans or if I'm really not. I do definitely experience dysphoria and want to be a woman, but at the same time I don't not want to be a man if that makes sense? It feels like a shitty escapist hypothetical but if I could just seamlessly transition back and forth I think that while I would probably spend more time as a woman I would definitely still spend time as a man.

Anyways, I'll stop rambling. I'm definitely taking this issue more seriously now and I'm looking into seeing a therapist about this. But I'm just wondering what other people thought about this. How similar was your experience to mine and if you did have a similar experience what was the turning point that made you say ""yeah I'm gender non-con not trans""

**""I think so""**

*""well sex is your biological sex and gender is basically what you feel you are""*

**""okay""**

*""and I've been struggeling quite a bit with what ""feeling like a woman"" actually feels like. I just feel like I don't have any connection to being female. It doesn't mean anything to me""*

**""well, yeah, it's just the way it is, I don't really feel anything about it either."" **

*""I just don't know what it's supposed to feel like to be a woman""*

**""but you're not unhappy with it, are you?""**

*""well, I'm not sure if I'm unhappy being a woman when I'm by myself, but now looking back, during my last 3 years of school (15-18 years) I at least tried hiding everything feminine about me...
I wore two sports bras on top of each other, one the wrong way around to bind my chest. I never wore tight clothes, didn't put on make up. 
But what really confuses me is that I still wore a dress and make up for prom (at the age of 18 where I'm from) and I didn't feel uncomfortable about that.""*

**""oh""**

*""but I don't want to be a man, I'm not a man. But I'm not sure about being a woman either.
Have you heard of non-binary genders?""*

**""no""**

*""well there is a lot of them, it's basically just anything that's not male or female. you know genderfluid for example? that's a non-binary gender, because it changes and it also includes being partly male, agender,... etc.
I was just wondering if I might be a part of those. But at the same time I don't even know if I believe in them myself.
A person I met recently said to me that they think that being non binary is less about being a new gender but of disregarding gender roles instead. And that kind of stuck with me. I've had similar thoughts about it.
What's strange though if it was just about disregarding gender roles, where does the dysphoria come from? You know what gender dysphoria is?""*

**""no not really""**

*""well it's basically just that feeling of being uncomfortable with your body, with the things that make you look like the sex you were assigned with at birth. for example me binding my chest or cutting my hair short happened because of my dysphoria. it makes me feel better in my own body.""*

**""what I find quite crazy is how human beings can think about these things. you know, it's basically just your brain right. and now you're thinking about why your brain is doing what it's doing with your brain. isn't that quite impressive?
Also why does nature even make people feel uncomfortable in their bodies? that doesn't make any sense at all... It has to do something with evolution. I don't feel like a person from the Stone Age was worried about what gender they were, they were just male and female and had to fight to survive.""**

*""oh that's really quite interessting, what I've been thinking about a lot as well is if gender is even real. You know, if society didn't exist and we were just by ourselves - would we even think about gender? Wouldn't we all just be human beings?
And that's why I don't wanna use any of these labels, although some of them fit me quite well. I'm just not sure if gender (or non binary genders) are even true. I just want to be who I am and I've come to the conclusion that I don't need a label for that. It has bothered me for far to long to be so insecure about who I am, just because I don't have a label for it. I'm just doing what feels best, and if cutting my hair and binding is a part of that, than I'm happy to do that. 
And I don't mind anymore if I'm agender, genderfluid or just a non-conforming woman, without a very strong connection to my gender.""*

We talked a bit more after that, about being brought up in quite a gender neutral environment, how we developed a feeling for gender or didn't, and how children develop through their environment full of binary adverts, gender roles, etc etc...

Just wanted to share this because it was the first time I tried talking about my feelings to a person that doesn't have a clue about gender and is a person that is very important to me.

(the conversation was in another language, the differentiation between the two doesn\'t exist)""*\n\n**""I think so""**\n\n*""well sex is your biological sex and gender is basically what you feel you are""*\n\n**""okay""**\n\n*""and I\'ve been struggeling quite a bit with what ""feeling like a woman"" actually feels like. I just feel like I don\'t have any connection to being female. It doesn\'t mean anything to me""*\n\n**""well, yeah, it\'s just the way it is, I don\'t really feel anything about it either."" **\n\n*""I just don\'t know what it\'s supposed to feel like to be a woman""*\n\n**""but you\'re not unhappy with it, are you?""**\n\n*""well, I\'m not sure if I\'m unhappy being a woman when I\'m by myself, but now looking back, during my last 3 years of school (15-18 years) I at least tried hiding everything feminine about me...\nI wore two sports bras on top of each other, one the wrong way around to bind my chest. I never wore tight clothes, didn\'t put on make up. \nBut what really confuses me is that I still wore a dress and make up for prom (at the age of 18 where I\'m from) and I didn\'t feel uncomfortable about that.""*\n\n**""oh""**\n\n*""but I don\'t want to be a man, I\'m not a man. But I\'m not sure about being a woman either.\nHave you heard of non-binary genders?""*\n\n**""no""**\n\n*""well there is a lot of them, it\'s basically just anything that\'s not male or female. you know genderfluid for example? that\'s a non-binary gender, because it changes and it also includes being partly male, agender,... etc.\nI was just wondering if I might be a part of those. But at the same time I don\'t even know if I believe in them myself.\nA person I met recently said to me that they think that being non binary is less about being a new gender but of disregarding gender roles instead. And that kind of stuck with me. I\'ve had similar thoughts about it.\nWhat\'s strange though if it was just about disregarding gender roles, where does the dysphoria come from? You know what gender dysphoria is?""*\n\n**""no not really""**\n\n*""well it\'s basically just that feeling of being uncomfortable with your body, with the things that make you look like the sex you were assigned with at birth. for example me binding my chest or cutting my hair short happened because of my dysphoria. it makes me feel better in my own body.""*\n\n**""what I find quite crazy is how human beings can think about these things. you know, it\'s basically just your brain right. and now you\'re thinking about why your brain is doing what it\'s doing with your brain. isn\'t that quite impressive?\nAlso why does nature even make people feel uncomfortable in their bodies? that doesn\'t make any sense at all... It has to do something with evolution. I don\'t feel like a person from the Stone Age was worried about what gender they were, they were just male and female and had to fight to survive.""**\n\n*""oh that\'s really quite interessting, what I\'ve been thinking about a lot as well is if gender is even real. You know, if society didn\'t exist and we were just by ourselves - would we even think about gender? Wouldn\'t we all just be human beings?\nAnd that\'s why I don\'t wanna use any of these labels, although some of them fit me quite well. I\'m just not sure if gender (or non binary genders) are even true. I just want to be who I am and I\'ve come to the conclusion that I don\'t need a label for that. It has bothered me for far to long to be so insecure about who I am, just because I don\'t have a label for it. I\'m just doing what feels best, and if cutting my hair and binding is a part of that, than I\'m happy to do that. \nAnd I don\'t mind anymore if I\'m agender, genderfluid or just a non-conforming woman, without a very strong connection to my gender.""*\n\nWe talked a bit more after that, about being brought up in quite a gender neutral environment, how we developed a feeling for gender or didn\'t, and how children develop through their environment full of binary adverts, gender roles, etc etc...\n\nJust wanted to share this because it was the first time I tried talking about my feelings to a person that doesn\'t have a clue about gender and is a person that is very important to me. \nI\'m quite happy about it and cant believe how nervous I felt before. \n', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'conversation about my thoughts on (my) gender with my cis-friend', 'created': 1523593143.0}"

I don’t fit in my body, right now, but earlier I did. I mean, I wasn’t dysphoric. Is it possible that I am overthinking?
I am always spacing out and fantasizing to escape from reality, and sometimes I just pretend to be someone else to cope. I wonder if I am not just playing a character.

I grew up in a very conservative and religious area, so being cis-female and straight was my only option. But I was very ""boyish"" growing up. I didn't really start feeling more feminine until I got my first period, and that's when I asked to grow my hair long and to buy feminine clothing. But I remember when I got my first period and my mother said something about me becoming a woman, and that my body was preparing itself to have a child. And it freaked me out on so many levels for years. It's almost like I started presenting more feminine in response to getting my period. Since then, I've hated boobs and curves. I call it the C-cup curse. 

It wasn't until I moved out for college that I started learning more about myself. I had to learn and undo a lot of homophobia and transphobia that I'd been raised on. It took about a year after moving out to discover that I'm probably asexual and that I'm attracted to multiple genders. 

The past 6 months or so is when it started to get confusing. I realized that maybe my attraction to men wasn't sexual or romantic, but actually me wanting to be them, to present like them. So I started researching more and found out about all the various genders there are. And the ones that really stuck out were genderfluid and demigender. 

At the moment, I'm not ready to give up some aspects of being female, no matter how much and how long I've wished to present as masculine. I think a large part of that is how I've just become accepted into my friend group and support system over the past year. They're totally supportive of anything and everything, but I spent a lot of that year slowly letting them into my life. I'm afraid of pulling a 180 on them. And I'm even more afraid to experiment and discover I was wrong all along. 

I've talked to the two friends closest to me about some things. One has started using they/them pronouns, but it makes me uncomfortable just because I didn't ask her too and because people have started asking why she doesn't use she/her pronouns when referring to me. It was the sole reason I talked to the other friend about this. I respect both of their willingness to change on a dime, but I'm not ready yet.

I thought I felt weird cause my wardrobe changed from feminine to masculine and wondered how that affected the relationship, well talking about it I realize my wardrobe changed because I was subconsciously realizing I’m a man. I even felt like the man in the relationship. Which is why dating cis straight men and lesbians made me uncomfortable, I was being treated like a girl. I think part of me wanted to subconsciously live vicariously through my current ftm boyfriend so I didn’t have to commit to my own identity. I shoved it down instead. I tried to create a vision of a female in myself I would like, but I’m realizing that vision was just what I found attractive in others and not what I saw for myself.

I came out around the same time I had a bunch of real intense surgeries and was in a wheelchair for a year. Painkillers for some reason do absolutely nothing for me, so I wound up tossing a bunch of them that I didn't take in a drawer. It wasn't on purpose, I'm kind of a packrat and I figured maybe I'd need it again some day.

After my parents disowned me for being trans, I didn't even have to look for it -- I knew right where it was. I kept it on hand for a long time, I researched how much I would have to take for it to be lethal and downloaded a PDF about fatal dosages to my laptop. I'm a super fucking big X-Men nerd so I always looked at it as that adamantium bullet in Logan. I really wanted to do it a lot of times, and I honestly don't have a good answer to why I didn't.

Anyway, my life has still been a chaotic nightmare. I haven't had a stable home for a few months and for a bit I stayed with a childhood friend of mine for a while while couch surfing. He used to be really fucking conservative, but since I came out to him, he's been one of the few people who really genuinely tried to understand what I was going through. For a couple of weeks, I let him borrow my computer when his broke. 

When I left his house he casually asked about keeping the old medication I wasn't taking at his place (a lot of my other stuff was staying there so maybe it was on accident, he didn't reference the medication specifically but did ask about the bag it was in). He's been through a lot physically the last few years and had his body beat the fuck up so maybe he just wanted to keep them. But I also think a lot about how he had access to that PDF document on my desktop. I think he knew. 

I wasn't in immediate danger of taking it, but it was definitely my escape route. I didn't say no when he asked about taking it -- it immediately crossed my mind that I wouldn't have access to that medication again -- but it was a conscious choice to let that option go.

(I’m a 26yo afab NB person, long-time lurker of this sub, first time posting!)

A few months ago I finally accepted that my discomfort with my body could possibly be alleviated with hrt - I’m the sort of person who will ruminate on something for a long time, and upon arriving at a conclusion will settle down quickly. My current view of my gender is that while I like expressing femininity at times, it feels more like a performance, and I don’t like being read as female when I’m not actively choosing to express my feminine side. I feel like my ‘baseline’ is much more masculine than what my body and face allows me to be read as, if that makes sense.
I do have concerns about doing hrt - mainly I’m worried about 1) having to come out to my family and acquaintances (which I’m just going to have to suck up when/if it gets to that), 2) that being read as male all the time will end up feeling as wrong as being read female all the time (which, even if that happens, I can’t imagine would be worse than how I feel now), and 3) that I won’t be comfortable expressing my femininity anymore after transitioning (which would honestly be an acceptable loss if it meant not having to deal with everything else).
My therapist keeps suggesting I talk more about my concerns about hrt, and that I should talk them through before he’ll refer me to an endocrinologist, but I don’t know what else to say! Knowing myself, #1 is something I’m going to worry about until I get it done, and #2 and #3 are only possibilities and I won’t know until I get there, y’know?
I understand his concern that I’m rushing, but this has been coming for a long time and I can’t imagine myself continuing to live with my body as it is now, and I feel like he thinks I’m neglecting to talk about something.

They looked like they couldn't believe I just came back from a hair cut and said something about ""curtains in front of your eyes"".

It makes me sad, but at least I'm happy I'm at least letting my hair grow longer. The lady who cut my hair said ""you've beautiful hair"" when she was done. I was so happy about that, she probably didn't even realized that these kind of words are what give me the courage to be more myself.
And other people like it fortunately more too. I know it was my own mistake of telling them I got a haircut,  I should have known this wasn't going to suddenly change their mind.

Is this normal that it hurts me?, I wish I learned as a child that there are more options than just the same short haircut.

2018-04-23 23:39:04,8eg16i,7,9,"Hi everyone! I’m an AFAB non-binary, genderqueer person. I have an appointment on Friday to talk about going on a “low dose” of testosterone. Does anybody else have any experience with this? Some notes about my reasoning and knowledge about it -

• I know that I can’t “pick and choose” what effects I’m going to get, and I’m not trying to
• I know the effects of testosterone will eventually level off at some point, they aren’t permanently cumulative (you don’t see cis men, for example, constantly being more masculinized after puberty due to the natural testosterone levels in their systems)
• I know testosterone is a stronger hormone than estrogen, effects-wise
• I know everyone has different androgen sensitivity levels

My boyfriend is a trans man and he is taking 50mg of T every week, so I have a pretty good firsthand idea of what the effects are, though I know it varies for everyone. I think I’d like to start at 25mg a week and adjust the dosage if needed, depending on how quickly things go, how I feel, etc.

Basically, I want to try and “level out” my appearance, voice, hair, etc. to be more balanced between the effects of estrogen and testosterone. I know it won’t be completely even or anything. I want to be more ambiguous. I feel like it will help me not only physically and socially, but mentally as well. Ideally, my end goal would be for me to find he right dosage to where I could be forever gender-ambiguous in that way, and be able to play up or down my masculinity or femininity depending on how I feel.

Went and got the Oestradiol (dammit, I spelt that wrong last time I wrote it down) that night and eagerly awaited for the next day.
I've now taken 14 pills and while I know that's not enough to cause any serious imbalances in my body without the t-blockers as well (although my doctor was a bit surprised at how very very low my t levels were beforehand already), and maybe I'm projecting a little but I'm excited you know. Haven't been this excited about something since I was eight and flying on a plane across most of the country by myself to visit my beloved grandma.

So maybe this stuff isn't related but given the circumstances I'll consider them somewhat so.
The only noticeable differences I've had are a slew of pimples (which is strange for my skin) and achy boobs.

2018-04-26 11:37:31,8f1y9p,8,4,"First off, hi, I’ve been thinking and thinking for a long time and I’m just so confused as to what I’m feeling and what I could be, so I hope I can get some advice. Forgive me, as I’m not the best writer, it’ll be a mess to read.

I’m 18, gay and AMAB. For around 3 years, I’ve been struggling with how I feel and what exactly I am.

I don’t really have an issue with being seen as/referred to as he and male, and I think I would prefer it to stay that way as I feel that she and her wouldn’t feel right, but I still get these weird unexplainable feelings that cause massive anxiety, when I think about this topic, so I don’t know what to do. I look down at my body and feel like something isn’t right, but I don’t know what, I wouldn’t rather have a femal body/figure though, as it just wouldn’t feel right to me. Honestly I sometimes feel like I’m not even human. Ive noticed that when I feel this way, i feel very antisocial and would rather be alone all day, could this just be my normal anxiety going crazy. 

I wouldn’t say I’m particularly masculine or feminine, maybe leaning a bit more towards masculine (I’m not even sure how you’d determine what is), but sometimes, I don’t feel like I fit with Male label but I still have a little affinity with it but lean towards women more, but then again this could be more of a social thing.

This is more of a physical thing, I’m not happy with how my body is, due to being overweight and generally unhealthy, I have some body hair but I’m neutral towards it, sometimes I wish it was more visable, others I don’t mind it. Although I do find it interesting to look at at times, I don’t think I’d like to remove all of it. In terms of my face, I don’t have much confidence in how I look, but it isn’t really due to looking male. As for my hair, I’m not sure if I would prefer longer or shorter, as I have only had it short, but I think long wouldn’t fit me as a guy.

As for my penis, I’m not sure, sometimes I’m fine with it, other times I’m not fine. Not sure if I’d want a vagina though.

Sometimes I get a feeling in and around my chest and nipples, it’s kind of like a phantom breast thing, it’s that or my nipples could be rubbing against my shirt or maybe just my social anxiety. I’m not sure what this feeling means.

On the rare occasion that I do see straight porn, I usually imagine myself as the girl, and how PIV sex would feel for me, I also rarely have sexual fantasies as a woman. Does this mean anything? With gay porn, I put myself in what position I feel like.

That’s all the feelings I can think of right now. I’m sorry it’s such a mess, and I probably sound crazy but I’m not sure how to get it all down coherently. I’m aware that I don’t need to label myself, but doing so would help me understand how I feel. The constant questioning is driving me crazy and piles on to my already existing anxiety and depression. A lot of the time, I can’t tell if I do feel this way, or my mind is just screwing with me, after all I tend to copy other people’s feelings without actually feeling that way.

I do have one question, how do you know when you feel more Male or female? Is it just a feeling that you know?
