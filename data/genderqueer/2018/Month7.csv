2018-07-01 15:09:05,8vai54,13,15,"Hi all,

I'm 15 years old and am assigned female at birth, and have been identifying with female for my whole life. However, the past months have been causing me some confusion. I guess it all started when I cut all my hair off. I cut my hair purely because I hated having hair, hated how it felt on me, hated how I looked with it, just hated myself in general. So around April I buzzed it down do about an inch or so. Being young and uneducated, my little sisters immediately started calling me ""boy"" as a joke. I thought I would have felt odd being called a boy, but it wasn't at all. I felt happier than I ever did after cutting my hair, and I never once cared when told I looked like a boy. I don't dress stereatypically feminine, I don't wear makeup, I can't stand skirts and only wear dresses to fancy events (which I rarely go to). My go to outfit is jeans/leggings/slacks and a jumper. 

When I see my body,﻿﻿﻿﻿ I don't think I feel dysphoria. Like I hate myself, but not because of my female anatomy. I would like to not have boobs but that's purely because they get in the way and are annoying. It's inconvenient, but not distressing. 

I feel kinda (weird?) when people refer to me as female. Like when my mum says ""girls can you come here"" i felt kind of (disconnected?) from it, but that may be because we refer to my little sisters as ""the girls"" so I wasn't part of that. Idk. But when I was asked what my pronouns were, it felt weird saying she/her. Like he/him would be weird too but IDK, maybe I'm just overthinking things and I'm cis, but I'm so confused because female doesn't really fully fit. What does it feel like to fully 'connect' with a gender? Am I just overthinking, and trying to put a label on nothing? Has anyone else been in my boat and have any experience?

2018-07-03 23:18:28,8vwtld,5,6,"AMAB, with gynecomastia. I sometimes feels like a boy and sometimes feels like a girl. 


Like when I was a kid, I got bored and said to my mum ""mum, today I want to be a girl!"" My mum would give me some of her clothes, and then I would play like a girl. 


Later I sometimes also took my mum's clothes myself without asking her. But at puberty I found when I wore her clothes thinking I was a beautiful girl I got erections. I knew girls don't have erections and was confused and afraid. I was scared that my mum would find out. If she found out, what would she say to me?! I could not imagine. Probably she would see me as a pervert? It seemed to me that if I wanted to be a girl, I could not have my male part, and otherwise I could not be a girl. So I stopped playing the ""mum, today I want to be a girl"" game. 


I feel it's like losing some great fun, kind of a regret, but I do not have dysphoria and I'm OK with being a guy. Each time I want to play the ""mum today I want to be a girl"" game, I would go online search for sex-change information. It could be fantasy, practical information, or porn. I have learnt a lot and am still gaining more and more knowledge about sex change. Besides, I will fantasise that I have a flat crotch and a vagina, and was being taken care of, dominated, loved and penetrated by a tall and muscular guy. Or I was playing scissoring with a girl. Just by fantasising and playing with my boobs (remember, I have gynecomastia) I could achieve multiple small orgasms. Like sudden electricity flows from the tip of my penis, only lasting 1 second, but could come many times in a row. I don't even need to touch my penis. It's far less intense than a full blown male orgasm, but it still feels really good.  


I used to have a room mate. I think I was in love with him and he was also in love with me. We use to do a lot things together and before we slept we used to talk with each until one of us felt into sleep. We even took showers together sometime, and he used to comment on my boobs and nipples. Like ""Wow, they are so big!"" In front of him, I think I exhibited my feminine side a lot more than usual. We kind of accepted each other the way we were. We didn't need to hide. But I couldn't physically get closer to him. I felt if I were a girl I would definitely want to have sex with him. I felt if I were to have sex with him, I was gonna offer him a vagina not a penis or anus. So we never had sex. 


Sometimes when I read success stories of post-op woman, or seeing their post-op bodies, not only the vagina folds, but also boobs, curvy hips and smooth skin, I am a bit jealous, because I couldn't have those. I am also jealous of those who have female voices. I've tried some ""voice therapy"" to sound more like a girl, so that it feels more real when I want to be a girl. My effort has not been successful. But anyway, I am happy for those transwomen, for they've got what they've been wanting so much. I think in the future if sex-change could be reversible, then I would definitely give it a try.  


For the rest of the time, I am just a guy. It's like 80% of the time I feel like a guy and 20% of the time I wish I were a girl. I had a girlfriend. When having sex, I was totally OK with being a guy. When I felt like being a girl, we would watch post-op transwoman porn and I would imagine I was the post-op transwoman. It's like they are my proxy, living a fantasy of mine. My ex-gf was fine with it and would sometimes tease me of being a girl. We broke up for other reasons.


I think that's my story. I used to have another account with a lot of down votes from those mtf people. It turned out that those mtf people didn't think I qualified to be one of them.

2018-07-09 00:45:52,8x6dns,6,6,"One thing I've been thinking about a lot recently is the relative focus put on mind vs. body in transgender circles, including both binary and nonbinary-centered ones.

I've always been someone focused more on the mind than the body. I'm a very emotional person, and I tend to experience life in terms of feelings a lot, and I also tend to be a pretty abstract thinker. I've always had an active imagination, and from an early age, I've read a lot, played a lot of make-believe games, made up lots of stories in my head, and things like that.

One thing I feel weird about is the large degree to which discussion of trans issues, both from trans people themselves, and from the broader society (who often discuss us in not-the-most-respectful ways) is the way discussion of transgender experience seems to focus on the body, almost exclusively, and neglect or ignore the mind.

I've always felt like my body isn't really that important to me. It's like, it's there, I live in it, and I want to take good care of it, but I've never felt like it defines me or is the most important aspect of who I am, or even anything close to it. When I think of the stuff most central to who I am, I think about things like my values, my ways of thinking, my knowledge, wisdom, my feelings, intuition, beliefs, impressions of things...all this stuff.

And so when I think about gender...the most important aspects of my gender have all been these things relating to my mind, and the body stuff seems less important, and primarily important insofar as it relates to the mental stuff. For example, social interaction, how i think about and relate to others, and how others interact with me, is central to my gender identity and experience of gender, both the positive aspects of it and the points of tension or struggle. And my body has only really been important to the degree to which it shapes these things, and even there...it doesn't feel like it's the thing that really matters to me.

I don't know if this is making much sense?

Like here are some thoughts I've been having about this topic:

* For me, the focus on the mind and drawing the focus away from the body feels like it makes me feel more comfortable in my identity as a trans person. When I separate the two, I feel more comfortable having a body that doesn't match my gender identiity. The intense focus on the body, both from the broader society, and in some trans communities, tends to make me feel worse: more dysphoria, more depression, more doubting of my identity. Focusing more on the mind makes me feel more confident in my identity and more comfortable with myself.
* The lack of discussion of mental and emotional facets of transgender experience I think has made it hard for me to get help navigating life situations. For example, one of the hardest things for me in life has been dating, especially, navigating the earlier stages of dating, and I often have found very few resources available that seem to address some of the struggles I have.
* I often just feel weird and alone when I think about this stuff. I'm like, are there people out there whose experiences of gender are so abstract, cerebral, and emotionally intense like mine? Yet not focused on the body?

And my body has only really been important to the degree to which it shapes these things, and even there...it doesn't feel like it's the thing that really matters to me.\n\nI don't know if this is making much sense?\n\nLike here are some thoughts I've been having about this topic:\n\n* For me, the focus on the mind and drawing the focus away from the body feels like it makes me feel more comfortable in my identity as a trans person. When I separate the two, I feel more comfortable having a body that doesn't match my gender identiity. The intense focus on the body, both from the broader society, and in some trans communities, tends to make me feel worse: more dysphoria, more depression, more doubting of my identity. Focusing more on the mind makes me feel more confident in my identity and more comfortable with myself.\n* The lack of discussion of mental and emotional facets of transgender experience I think has made it hard for me to get help navigating life situations. For example, one of the hardest things for me in life has been dating, especially, navigating the earlier stages of dating, and I often have found very few resources available that seem to address some of the struggles I have.\n* I often just feel weird and alone when I think about this stuff. I'm like, are there people out there whose experiences of gender are so abstract, cerebral, and emotionally intense like mine? Yet not focused on the body?\n\nI'd be curious to hear if any of this resonates with any of you!!!"", 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Focus on Mind vs. Body in Transgender Circles', 'created': 1531122352.0}"

So I'm someone who has always strongly questioned the legitimacy of the gender binary (at least from high school onward), but I've lived my whole life as a cis girl, and will probably continue to do so, with my cis guy partner. We're talking about having a kid soon, and as I look into parenting and pregnancy stuff, I'm finding all the binary-ness to be pretty overwhelming. Like, I'm really not looking forward to everyone asking me ""what I'm having"" and if I'm going to do a ""gender reveal."" And then when the kid is born, all the gendered gifts and comments (though I'm sure they would come from a good place).

I've been thinking a lot about how I want to approach the subject of gender if I get pregnant, and there are some things I'm pretty sure about, but other things where I'm totally clueless.

I'm sure I don't want to find out the ""gender"" before giving birth. I'm sure I want to choose a gender-neutral name. I'm sure I want to choose toys from princess to Power Ranger and everything in between.

But then there are those things like clothing and pronouns that would probably have to be binary, if nothing else because I couldn't handle the constant judgment, and it might actually make life unnecessarily difficult for my kid if I veer from the norm.

Obviously, the gender binary will be learned by my child no matter what I do, because they'll see and learn it everywhere they go. I just want to make sure I don't put my kid in a box, that I live at least somewhat true to my belief that the gender binary is bullshit, but also that I don't make life any harder for them by setting them up for bullying and judgment.

I would really appreciate hearing any thoughts on this from y'all. Have you seen any successful or unsuccessful examples of this? Is it ridiculous that I'm even thinking about it?

2018-07-09 18:19:58,8xegpv,0,1,"tl;dr: I am a counselor working at a group home trying to be out as genderqueer/pansexual to simultaneously provide a queer staff to help questioning youth and an example to humanize queer folk and promote tolerance in our organization. Help! (skip to the end for my questions)

So, I work as a lead residential counselor with adjudicated male youth. I like to jokingly call it glorified, really complicated babysitting, but essentially it's a group home with 14-18 boys, ages 13-18. My job is to basically guide them through their daily schedule and help them to learn life/coping skills in-the-moment as situations arise. Additionally, since I'm a lead counselor at my place of work I am personally in charge of 5 boys and work with them closely one-on-one in learning skills and completing goals to get them back on track in their lives.   


We recently have had a resurgence of a lot of racial and homo/transphobic talk coming from the group (it kind of fluctuates in waves at my facility). I put together a ""diversity group"" at my work that will help to educate them on the differences between us, ranging from gender/sexuality to culture to things like economic class issues. 

Personally, I identify as genderqueer (/nonbinary around people who might balk at ""queer"") and pansexual, so my first focus was on trying to spread some factual information about sexuality and gender to them. We have a human sexuality group, but that is largely focused on topics such as birth control and consent etc. and doesn't really go into depth on anything outside cultural norms. We also do not really have any queer staff working (we're rather rural but luckily have a range of religious/cultural/political backgrounds at least). After a lengthy discussion with my boss who runs the facility, we decided that it would be useful to ""come out"" to them as a way of providing a queer support at my facility for youth that may be questioning and as an opportunity to teach tolerance and help humanize queer folk to boys whose only real exposure to them has been from misguided rhetoric from their families, schools, and peers. This was entirely my idea, and I went to my supervisor for feedback on whether it could be something helpful or if it would just provide too much conflict in my workplace etc. as well as how to go about it if I did. The idea was to essentially introduce it as an example when we got to nonbinary/genderqueer discussion in the diversity group and integrate it into the discussion.   


Well, I had the group on gender/sexuality last Saturday and it went even worse than I expected. :D I set firm expectations that they could communicate that they had issues with the concepts being discussed, and even provide why they don't agree with things, but it had to be done in a respectful way. I wanted there to be discussion and conversation. The point of the diversity group was to inform and to show that we can respect one another even if we can't agree with or accept certain things. However, I essentially ended up cancelling the group before we could really even get past the basics of what sex/gender/sexuality really mean due to a lot of really negative and trans/homophobic statements pretty much right out of the gate. Rather than support that kind of disrespectful communication, I told them we would try again at a future date. 

I segued that into a discussion about why this was such a touchy subject for them, and why they had such knee-jerk impulsive reactions to the topic. It actually was a pretty good discussion, and out of that one of the big points of contention with them was that they would not be talking that way if there was a ""gay person"" in the room. They also had a lot of comments about people outside of cis/heteronormativity being ""weird."" I saw that as a good opportunity and shared with them that I was nonbinary/pansexual, which was something that simply hadn't been relevant at my work before, but I was sharing now because it was important for them to understand that you can't know how people identify by just looking at them, and that disrespectful/hateful comments didn't have a place even in private conversations because you simply don't know when you might be hurting someone or alienating someone who might identify as whatever it is you're making fun of. I also reinforced with them that more and more people are coming out as queer in some form or another and will continue to do so, so it was valuable to understand more about them and practice tolerance.   


Talk about a mic drop. :D The response was exactly what I was hoping for, and everyone remained respectful after that. We didn't go into more discussion about the concepts then (I told them if they wanted to find out what nonbinary and pansexual meant they'd have to come to the next group :P), and wrapped up with expectations for how future groups would go. Coincidentally, that group was at the tail end of my shift and I was leaving to go on my weekend, so it gave them two days to consider how the group went etc. On my way out luckily nobody treated me any differently and all were friendly as they wished me a good weekend and such. Time will tell if issues start to arise. 

One positive out of the group already is that one youth came to me afterwards and said that when I introduced our topic for the day his stomach dropped because he was pansexual and had been on the receiving end of a lot of bullying over it. I was able to extend an open invitation to talk about gender/sexuality issues whenever he felt like he needed to and he seemed grateful. 

Which brings me to why I'm actually posting this here today. I am very confident in my work and my ability to navigate this issue with the boys (if I wasn't, I wouldn't have even approached the subject), but this is really the first time I've been out in the general public. I would appreciate any tips you all might have for me. Any feedback on how to communicate these ideas with teenage boys? Overcome resistance from boys that have ingrained prejudices in wanting to work with me? (One of our most \*phobic boys is one that I have good rapport with and work with frequently) Feedback on dealing with coworkers who might not understand or might disagree with me (my boss is very supportive already, but I really have no clue how most of my coworkers will react)? Any resources you know of to help counselors/educators with these topics?

2018-07-11 12:59:33,8xzcpg,12,38,"CW: Talk of dysphoria and body image issues.

So hey. I'm an AMAB nonbinary and the way that manifests in me is a really strong feeling of not liking being explicitly gendered either way. To use an example my desired androgyny is kind of an 80s style Annie Lennox/David Bowie gender ambiguity that aims for presentation that sits in the middle of masc and femme, specifically as opposed to the mixing of explicitly gendered signifiers from multiple genders. In many ways the idea of being seen as a ""Man in a dress"" is kinda internally horrifying to me, and the butch lesbian aesthetic is something that I can feel a lot more at ease with.

That strong aversion to being explicitly gendered extends to my body and while I've contemplated it, I really don't think I'm a good candidate for HRT. There are too many things about my body as it is that I wouldn't want to change that HRT would impact in addition to the things it would help.

So my problem I'm having at the moment: My face. It's mannish. And I kinda hate that to the point where it's impacting my ability to be happy in day to day life. My weight has yo-yo'd a lot over the last few years for a variety of reasons. And when I lose weight my face looks too masculine and I get dysphoria, and when I'm in a more fat phase I... well I feel better about the contours of my face but then I start hating my body in other ways.

Am I just fucked? Is there anything outside of saving up for facial feminisation surgery that might make me feel less ugly or dysphoric?

I'm afab and kind of in a mess with gender questioning right now. I've identified as a butch lesbian for a while now, and since figuring out my butchness I felt for a while that I was a gender conconforming cis woman. 

Lately I've been reading a LOT about non binary and now I'm sort of unsure. I definitely get dysphoria. I changed my feminine birthname to an androgynous name years ago. My breasts don't feel like they belong to me, I eradicated my period with science, I can't deal with wearing dresses. I would love to be flat chested, more muscular (I work out, but progress is slow), maybe have more body hair, be a bit gruffer in general. I don't identify as male at all, but I love getting mistaken for a guy and I think I would be fine with he pronouns, though she ones don't bother me. 'They' is okay but (to me) feels more wishy washy and doesn't really sound right, though feels natural to refer to friends of mine who use them.

Most of that sounds very genderqueer on paper. But it feels like an almost a choice on if I point to myself and go 'look, a woman can be anything', or say I'm now not actually woman or am something else alongside woman. It feels political whichever way, too. 

Calling myself trans feels like stepping on the stories of those with more a defined transition. Though I have some of the same experiences... dysphoria, deadnaming, would consider top surgery. But maybe I just have those experiences as a cis person. I mean, I do recognise like you can be trans without feeling any of that too. 

It's just weird to break down gender this much. It's not your presentation, your pronouns, your social experience. People say it's an internal thing, but that just feels like calling however I feel about all this a gender.

I'm afab, and bigender (at least, I'm pretty sure). Half the time I love my body (minus the extra weight), and the other half of the time I completely hate it and am very discomforted by it. 

When I am female, I love doing my hair, makeup and wearing dresses. I love my pronouns and name. My body gives me very little discomfort.

When I am Male I hate my body and face. I Feel very detached from it. Pronouns dont bother me much outside of my home, though on Male days I love when my husband uses my Male name and pronouns. But it doesnt bother me much if not used when out.

I'm exploring my identity and now that I've accepted my Male self, I feel happy, exhilarated, and downright terrified.

My issue is that I dont know if I should come out. My husband is aware of my exploring and seems to be supportive. I'm an adult with my own family. My husbands family are very catholic and not understanding whatsoever to the lgbt community. My family is very conservative religious people. Again, not convenient for a gender non conforming person. Additionally, I have kids that I dont want to confuse or scare. I dont want them bullied for me being who I am. And honestly, even when I am a guy, I love being mommy. I never want that to change.

For now I am good being my Male self inside my home mostly when the kids are asleep or not home. I do wear my husbands clothes alot both inside the home and out in public and this doesnt bother them as I've always done this. I have binded my chest and recently packed in front of them, but they didnt seem to notice, as I guess in some way I've always tried flattening my chest. And truthfully, they just weren't looking at my lower area and asking about it. Currently, I am not comfortable wearing my beard and using my Male name and pronouns around my kids family or friends. But the urge to go out in public as my Male self is strong. When I'm Male, I have to have a beard. It's the only way I feel remotely close to who I am. I spend a lot of tedious time applying a fake beard to wear around my house a few hours a day while my kids are at school. I havent been able to do this as its summer, and I'm feeling lost lately. The feeling of needing to have my beard is becoming almost unbearable at times.

My questions....Should I just come out and deal with all the hate, questions, confusion and problems? Should I just be my Male self at home? Should I try going somewhere away from home to be Male in public? What was it like your first time going out???

Also, my hair is straight and halfway down my back. if I choose not to come out but cut my hair short (shaved pixie), will this out me regardless??? Should i cut my hair? I keep going back and forth. I feel like I really want to and then my anxiety and fear creeps back In. If i cant even cut my hair how am i going to get through the biggest stuff??? Should I start by slowly wearing more mens clothes (meaning i start buying my own vs. Wearing my husbands) until I'm comfortable wearing them out and people dont even notice??? People dont notice now as I frequently go out in his tshirts and basketball shorts. But I want to get my own mens Jean's, flannels, boots, button ups. But I'm afraid cutting my hair and beginning to wear my own mens clothes will completely out me if I dont come out.

2018-07-31 19:18:41,93hi04,0,3,"So I'm genderqueer and polysexual. I have been for awhile, and I am very confident in the fluidity of my gender identity. My psyche is plural. My personality is a diverse spectrum - a continuum. There are many versions of me: some of them male, some female, some beyond the binary. Together they form a unified Gestalt - the self, ""me,"" and that ""me"" is not cis.

But for the most part, I still look and dress like a boy. 

I was AMAB, I have very distinctively ""masculine"" features, and I feel most comfortable in just casual jeans/t-shirt attire.

I like wearing makeup, my gender performance is across the spectrum and my behavior is absolutely fluid, but when I'm out in public I don't usually wear anything more than foundation/lip gloss (if that) and I never wear dresses (my feminine aspect is more ""soft butch"" anyway. Dresses don't really appeal to her.)

It's not that I don't want to go out in more non-conforming fashion with a full face of makeup, it's just my anxiety gets the better of me. I have pretty bad PTSD (I'm a trauma survivor) and in a way ""boy drag"" acts as a sort of safety blanket and defense mechanism in public.

I'm not questioning my identity, or my authenticity. I know gender identity and presentation are seperate things. I'm not cis. I know this. I feel this deeply. I have the monthly bouts of dysphoria to boot.

I am concerned, though. I'm the new kid in town without many friends (I just moved to NYC) and I want to connect with genderqueer/non-conforming/non-binary/trans groups and people, but I'm worried they will see me and just think ""who's this cis gay dude and why is he here?"" My therapist says I shouldn't alter my gender performance to fit another person's expectations, but how comfortable will others feel with a very male-presenting AMAB person in their safe space?

Does anyone have any insight to share or a similar experience to mine?
