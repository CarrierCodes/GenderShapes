Okay so, a few months back I went through a shortish spell of hectically questioning my gender, and then that kind of went away. Fast forward a month or so, and my partner figured out she's trans. This caused an avalanche of research on gender for both of us, and I am back at the questioning stage.

Here's the deal: I'm afab, totally happy with feminine pronouns. I generally don't experience dysphoria, but sometimes my breasts annoy me and I would rather they were gone. I also hate my uterus, but that's mostly unrelated (I think?). I definitely don't want to be a man. At all. Ever. But I do think having a penis would be much better than having a vagina.

My partner has pointed out that I've never been femme, which doesn't say anything in itself, but it did make me realise some things. Jokes referring to me being the man in the relationship and the like have never bothered me, and according to some things I've read, that would bother the average cis woman? As a kid, my friends would always make me play The Boy in whatever game we were playing or story we were making up, and that was fine. Later on, I started choosing that role for myself, because I enjoyed it. And that was weird to some people. In terms of my relationship, I've always taken on a traditionally masculine role, with regards to old-timey expectations of men, like being physically protective (I'll punch them if they're mean to you!!) Or buying things for my partner with the fantasy in my head that I'm a man in the 1950s spoiling his woman. Even before my partner came out as trans.

I don't want to present as a man, but I don't feel 100% like a woman either. I haven't been able to make sense of all the terms for people similar to me, and I'm kind of searching for a label to point me in the general direction of people like me.

2018-08-01 23:54:16,93ud9w,16,6,"Hi!, so I wanted to ask about a topic that I really don't undestand about being a transgender person, but because I'm trans too but I think I have a very weird and different experience, and maybe I'm not even trans, I don't really know.

Well, first of all, I'm non-binary and agender. I think that gender it's a social construct, but that doesn't mean that gender doesn't exist (I'm just really neutral about it in my case), instead, I think that gender and sex doesn't have anything in common at all: your body doesn't dictate your gender identity, your body it's not just a man or a woman body, it's yours, and if you are a man/woman/nonbinary/genderqueer, it's a man/woman/nonbinary/genderqueer's body, that's it (I'm saying about gender, not sex).

So I have two questions:

1. I think that a lot of people think like me, that you are not less of your gender for having your body. But I don't understand something, and it's that, even if they say that gender and sex doesn't have to be linked, why do most of the trans community want to change their body and why they have body dysphoria in the first place? I understand social dysphoria because it's horrible when people misgenders you and don't treat you as how you want to be percieved, but... if you are a man or a woman because you feel like it and not because of your parts, why do we have to try to get another type or body to feel validated? It's like a contradiction.
Is is because cis people, that are relly ignorant, doesn't validate your gender because of your body and you have to change it? Or because you don't really like it in the first place, 
(independently  about what cis people see you as)?

(I want to say that I asked this question to some other people and told me that they really don't like their body because of their sex, not because society makes them believe that you 	have to have a female sex to be a woman or a male sex to be a man, etc. So, what I want to say it's that it's more about medical transition about someone's sex?, I think. Not just 	socially. Sorry if I'm not good at explaining it, just tell me if I'm saying things wrong) 

What I'm trying to say it's that a lot of people think that they have to ¨pass¨ as a woman or a man, but isn't that cissexist or sexist? You are a woman or a man if you feel like it, you don't become a woman or a man. So, if I'm really wrong, tell me.


2. Something that I really noticed it's that, if someone is transwoman, for example, they tend to be really femenine and wear very femenine clothes all the time, and viceversa. (Or if someone is nonbinary, they have to be androgynous).

So... In my case, I wear whatever I want, without thinking about something is femenine or masculine. I don't really care. And I'm not saying that you can't be stereotipically femenine or masuline, or androgynous. What I'm trying to say it's that sometimes I feel that I'm a fake agender or a fake trans because of this, that I don't care about the gender roles of my identity (In my case, being androgynous), and that I have to be like super stereotipical because I'm faking it. And I'm sure some people doesn't care either whatever they wear.

And it's interesting because cis people tend to care less about gender roles (I know there is a 	lot of sexism in the world, but I think there is less). They are a lot of femenine cis guys and 	masculine cis gals. So, can trans people ignore gender roles too? Or are we less trans? And what makes you woman or man, because of being femenine or masculine? Or about the concept and feeling of being that group in society, for example? I think that's really interesting, and I wanted to know about your opinions. And sorry if there's something rude that I said, and I don't mean to say that you should obey me about what you have to do with your lives, or anything like that, obviously. People should just do whatever they want to. But yeah, thank you for reading.

Am I special in just always having been me without feeling the need to slap a gazillion labels on myself?
So I read some explanations from genderfluid / genderqueer people and what I encountered most of the time was a variation of ""sometimes I like to act feminine and like girl things and other times I prefer manly stuff and act more masculine"". While I get feeling actual dysphoria from thinking of yourself as ""a guy"" or ""a girl"", I don't see the need to label myself gender queer just because I exhibit traits or preferences that are perceived as typically male or female, because those are just terms society uses to describe stuff and that stuff varies from society to society at that. As gender for me is a narrow category I don't need see the need to fit into, I don't feel a need to use something else than what is already there and instead just expand the category.
I think that I myself would qualify as gender queer, but I never felt the need to search beyond ""girl / woman with unfortunately not very female body nor face and mostly at home with more typically masculine stuff, interests and friends"". That's just who I am - my face is so androgynous that most people mistake me for a man when I'm not wearing makeup, my body kind of got stuck halfways (primary genitalia and rather slight general build definitely female, everything else debatable) and most of my life I got along much better with typical men, meaning in terms of communication type and interests. I can't stand some behavior typically seen as female. Most of my friends are male because I just can't connect to most women as easily. I wore loose, baggy clothes well into my late teens, mostly because I was overweight. I never put on makeup because I thought that looks shouldn't be that important. Yet I hate the fact that I'm not pretty and typically female-looking and that people mistake me for a man, I love wearing feminine stuff that accentuates the feminine traits I do have now, I'm very emotional, I'm very communicative and sociable, I love that my boyfriend is a little bit taller and a lot stronger than me, I love singing and a lot more and people that not just judge by my face would definitely identify me as female.

I never cared about how women should behave and what was expected of a female, I always did my own thing and was just me. When I wanted to hit on someone I met, I just did and saw how they reacted.
Is it just that I have never put any weight on predefined terms and that my personal circumstances have been so that I always was my own category in every conceivable way or am I genderqueer or agender or whatever and don't know it?
How do you define ""feeling male"" and ""feeling female"" when for me, I just do what the heck I want without bothering if it is masculinely or femininely attributed? Is it easier for a woman because, at least in my culture, accepted-ish behavior for females is still a much broader spectrum than that for males?

2018-08-03 02:34:46,945rag,2,18,"Alright, so I came here to write something about what I'm feeling/going through, and I just stared at this screen for about five minutes. I don't really know how to begin describing it. It feels like my masculine and feminine energies are highly polarized, kinda like oil and water. I don't really know how to get into it any deeper than that. It's like trying to bite my own teeth. On one hand, I feel like an apex predator: an indestructible turbo tank that has to take over the world because he can't admit he has feelings. Contrasting this, I feel like a little girl. I know this is because I had to suppress a lot of myself growing up and never had the opportunity to explore my feminine side. But now it's completely disconnected from who I am, yet *I am it* at the same time. 

I feel completely developmentally stunted as a human being. This is on top of being schizophrenic, so you know crippling loneliness is just an expected byproduct of me being a complete freak in the eyes of the average person. I don't feel able to be myself, because there's no clear answer to who I am. In any given situation, I feel pulled in completely opposite directions, which just leaves me unable to execute on anything because my thoughts and feelings get so swarmed and I get confused. I feel pathetic.

I hate my body. At the same time I know I'd still hate it if I changed anything, just a different type of hate. I know, I know. I need to come to love who I am. I'm having a hard time with that. Every day is filled with reminders that I'm held back by my own lack of identity. I feel like I'm in a fog. I don't know what direction I want to travel because when I take one step in a particular direction, I feel this pull from inside me telling me I should be going the other way.

This whole thing ended my last relationship. There were days when I just wasn't attracted to her. I wound up resenting her because I felt like she was preventing me from being happy, trapping me in a box. There are days when I feel particularly stronger one way or the other, but it never lasts. It's always fluid, and changes rather frequently.

I feel extremely dominant some days, like I'm taking on the world and nothing can stop me. I actually have messianic delusions that are directly tied to this. But then there are other times when I am the lowest piece of shit on Earth and deserve to be used by everyone and everything. I have so much trouble making forward progress in anything as a result, especially making friends/fostering any sort of relationship, platonic or not.

Meeting people in person is extremely hard because of my disorder. I'm taking action to change that, hopefully recondition myself to be less anxious and thus less symptomatic. But in the meantime, there's nothing going on in my dating/networking world. I'm a writer, so it's easy for me to get my foot in the door through apps/websites, but I can't really have a lasting conversation with anyone.

Or, I'll get embarrassed about having certain feelings/desires and not be able to express anything. I know I shouldn't feel that way about my sexuality, but I had to repress everything growing up and those thought patterns are still there.

I'm really lonely. I cry a lot, but usually I'll have some massive storm emotionally where I can just feel my masculine side rise up and bear its teeth, and I wind up punching myself a lot. And hard. I want to stop doing that and I know it revolves around coming to accept myself fully. It's just so hard. There's nothing to grab onto; it's like water running through my fingers. What do I love?

I'm a 31 year old AFAB, and other than always being slightly more tomboy I never really has any reasons to believe I'm anything other than a cis woman.

About a year ago, I had my first bout of dysphoria. I was a man. I knew it, felt it, wanted nothing more than to have a Male body and present Male. During this time I started using Male pronouns and a male name but only online. My real life had no clue. But after only a few weeks that faded. I was a woman. And comfortable. This past January, I had this extreme change, I was a guy and I need to transition. I came out to my husband who thankfully was completely supportive and said he'd be there with me through whatever I needed. This time it lasted about 2 months. But then, I literally woke up one morning and was a woman again. No feelings of being a guy whatsoever. Ever since I tend to go about a month between changes. I'm either fully guy, or fully girl. Currently I'm a girl. I have no dysphoria whatsoever and I'm mostly happy with who I am and my body. But when I'm a guy, I'm ready to transition. I need a beard, a flat chest, a deeper voice, something else downstairs. I am working on just dealing with my swings and not socially coming out. I dress more androgynously when I'm a guy, and more feminine when I'm a girl, and when at home i go the extra mile and pack and bind. But I'm not sure socially coming out as genderfluid is something that I should or could do. I'm married, I have kids, neither my husbands or my family would understand or try to understand. Thoughts? Ideas?

I came to terms that I was queer about a year ago, but I didn't know a dam thing about the LGBTQ community so I started doing research. As I went I found terms for thing I didn't know beforehand, (Sidenote, I know that these are just generalizations of the spectrum of identity that is out there)

First I came out to my close friend that I was pan, I chose her because she and I were dating at the time and are still generally close friends, (also she's Bi, that might be part of it)

But I wasn't very happy with that decision and was just ending up looking at this and some other subreddits about this stuff.
I ended up staring at one word a lot, Gender Fluid, the first instance that I saw the term was in a book one of my queer friends lent me, (more forced me to read it, but never mind) the books title was 'The Symptoms of Being Human' and it was a very good read.

One term that was used in the book was and I quote as best I can,
""Its less like a switch and more like a knob, it can go up or down and anywhere in between."" That quote really summed up what I was feeling at the time so I started to identify as gender fluid.

Now fast forward to three month ago, when school was almost over for the summer and my 'gender knob' so to speak so stuck on full girl mode and stayed that way until three days ago when I was identify as female. But lately I've been feeling more fluid and between, I'm also feeling very confused. None of my friend ever respond to me so I thought I would try this subreddit.

2018-08-11 23:00:07,96ko3u,11,44,"Hi! Sorry, i’m probably going to rant for a bit. 
First of all, I’m Felix, i’m AMAB, kinda non-binary, and right now, I’m very sad.

I just finished my last day at my job, a job that I loved sooo much, partly because it was such a feminine environment (serving food to people!) and becaue i could wear a cute aprin all day. Oh, and great collegues too! I reqlly had some great times with them, and particularly one girl i was working with. 

First time I saw her, I knew she was going to break my heart! After a couple weeks working together, we developped a great friendship and I was just constantly amazed at how good and funny of a person she is! 

Today, we were talking and she said that she kept talking about me to her bf and he got jealous. She laughted and proceded to tell me how she told him we would certainly never date. I diverted the conversation on her bf’s jealousy and she said it wasn’t that bad, and even if I wasn’t gay he would not care that much. 

The thing is, i never told her I was gay... and she is not the first to just assume I can’t  possibly be anything else! I don’t blame her, but it really annoyed me. 

It’s more than that, everytime I’ve liked someone, its the same story repeating itself over and over and over again. Every single time, it leads to a similar conversation: from the “help me to find a bra for this guy i’m going on a date with tonight” to the “you’re like a sister to me”, it always hurt so much. 

And inevitably, after it happens I think about what I should have done or said, how I could “man up” if I would like to know what the fuss is all about with requited love sometimes before I turn 50 (i’m 23 now). But everytime I try I fail miserably, because that is not me, I’m not a man, i’m not that guy that will make someone feel safe, I can’t look at a person like a piece of meat and I can’t be direct about my feelings... 

It’s hard not to lose hope, to still believe one day there will be a miracle. For a moment, I thought she was that miracle, she didnt seem to care I wasnt very manly, she likes girls too anyways, so why not me? 

I knew it would not happen, but that very tiny bit of hope made me feel better. 

Tomorrow I’m leaving for a new country, very traditional and far from accepting non-binary people. I’ll spend the next months pretending to be someone I’m not and all those things together are just making me so angry at myself and my life... And gosh do I feel alone.

So there was recently a troll in r/nonbinary and their Reddit history showed them posting on one of those r/unpopularopinion threads shitting all over nonbinary people, as can (unfortunately) be expected. Of course I had to read through the comments.



What is with all these people assuming nonbinary people are just looking to rebel? I'm pretty much a goody two shoes. Teacher's pet, hard worker. What the heck am I rebelling against by having atypical gender dysphoria?



What is with the assumption that we are all looking for attention? I'm pretty reserved.

2018-08-17 06:15:56,97zwid,0,1,"So a few months ago I posted some rather depressed, hopeless posts on how I really didn't think I was ever going to be out properly as transmasc nonbinary, that I was struggling, that I didn't know how to come out to my husband of 12 years or if he would accept it... I was in a pretty dark place.

And then some things happened.

I played a video game (Detroit: Become Human) which, without spoiling, had a main character that I really related to. Like, he was conflicted, he struggled with his identity vs. his duty, he was even scared of being perceived a certain way, even though those around him pushed him towards being his true self.

He was afraid. I was afraid, too.

Some time while playing that game, I had an epiphany and it was this: that I'm always going to be nonbinary whether I accept it or not, I'm always going to be nonbinary whether I come out or not, but that accepting it and trusting others to accept it will bring me a sense of peace and allow me to stop feeling guilty and conflicted about it. That if I didn't come to terms with it, it was going to destroy me.

After that window shattered, it took me about a week to compose a letter to my husband explaining that I feel more masculine than feminine (I'm AFAB), that I suffer gender dysphoria, and that while I'm still too scared to transition, it may be something I need to pursue and in the meantime I definitely need to do more as my dysphoria is becoming crippling. I asked for his support. I didn't really know how much of it I would get since he's never shown more than a passing interest in masculine individuals and has said mixed things on trans issues in general.

Things went way better than I expected. I cried a lot, we've had tons of talks, just hours of speaking at length about my feelings and he's better than OK with it, he basically said that he's known in some sense for a long time and he loves me for me. He has a lot to learn but he's been so open to learning and that's so huge I can't even describe how it feels.

Then he tried using masculine/neutral terms for me and it feels good, like now he calls me his partner and sometimes his husband and oh, the gender euphoria is so good!!

Suddenly I feel a lot of hope for the future. I still have some bugs to work out, I still don't know where I'm going regarding transitioning, but I feel like I've broken the wall in my mind where I'd felt I had a choice between my gender and my marriage.

2018-08-20 02:01:32,98po0i,4,6,"Gender is something I've ""struggled"" with my entire life. I've had moments of low self esteem (ie. highschool) but overall I am fairly confident in myself and unashamed of letting people know who I am. A lot of my close friends and family (siblings)...even some co-workers know I am non-binary or genderfluid/queer or at the least something along those lines. That brings me to my problem...which I've suddenly realized....is a pretty huge problem. I have been dating the same person for over three years and they DO NOT KNOW that I am not a woman. Sometimes, I am unbothered by this. But other times, like as I type this message knowing it will be read by people who understand...it hurts badly.

Now, before anyone shames me for not being more open with someone I am dating...there are reasons (albeit abused as excuses) as to why it has been SO LONG that I've let this go.

There's been a lot of questioning, a lot of confusion, a lot of coming out of the closet; but I feel like I've finally landed where I belong, despite the fact that my current identity doesn't make much sense when you take it at face value.

I'm genderless, and I consider myself pretty much completely removed from womanhood; being read, referred to, or thought of as female makes me dysphoric and upset. And yet the label I feel most at home with is ""lesbian."" It encompasses my feelings about both my sexuality and my gender in a way I have a lot of trouble describing. I know that, at its root, lesbian simply means a woman who only loves women; but I feel that lesbian history and culture has imbued a deeper meaning in the label that allows for nuances such as myself.

And on top of that? I've been medically transitioning with testosterone for over a year now. I go by a masculine name. While I don't care about passing 24/7 as much as I used to, I often bind while I'm out and generally try my best to either confuse people or be read as an effeminate male.

I'm here to tell you that you shouldn't have to do that. You can be a genderless lesbian! You can medically transition as a nonbinary person -- hell, you can even medically transition as a cis person if that's what you really want! Do what makes you happy rather than trying to make sense of something that is inherently nonsensical.

Don't get me wrong; I know not everyone can be open about their identity, and that sometimes people have to fake their way through life for safety. I'm not saying you should put yourself at risk. But in the privacy of your own mind and in the anonymity of the internet, you can be anything you want, and I think it's important to take advantage of that if you can.

I am a 31 year old straight female (you'll have to excuse my lack of knowledge for labels I'm new to this all) who started dating a straight man, we got married after about 2 years of serious dating. During the beginning of our relationship i caught him messaging gay men on Craigslist, he broke down and expressed that when he was about 13 he was sexuality molested by a male neighbor. 

Long story short he told me that he was attracted to men and woman, also that he enjoyed dressing up as a woman from time to time but That he loved me and wanted to be with me. 

I am not homophobic. I believe people should love who ever they want and be who ever they want. I also knew that if i didn't at least try and see what his fetishes were about and let him express himself in any way he felt comfortable, or relationship would surely fail. 

Things were fine for a while till we got pregnant  (yay) and my patents had to move in causing him to closet his feelings again. He eventually behind my back started seeking attention from people online. Male attention. 

I threatend to leave, he still expressed his feelings and that he wanted to make it work. I told him he needed to start going to therapy just to address the feelings he had. Therapy worked well for us. I recommend it to any married couple even if there's no real problem in your relationship. During our most recent sessions he expressed that he sometimes felt like he feels like a woman in a mans body. That he is attracted to both sexes, and that there are days where he feels like a man. That is been a very hard thing for him to accept as he is obviously very conflicted with his identity and his whole family would not accept this at all. 

Our therapist quickly labeled him as a transgender, and although i value her opinion, a part of me feels like it was just a term she tossed out and maybe she's right. But i guess i wanted to post this in the hopes that maybe someone can relate and offer advice, maybe other subreddits?

2018-08-24 16:26:03,99yv0j,11,70,"I feel really stupid about this revelation honestly.  I’ve always prided myself on being very self aware. Since I was 4 years old, I’ve known that I wasn’t straight. My word for my sexual identity has evolved over time and now I sit happily under the umbrella term queer. But I never even considered that I wasn’t cisgendered. Except for all the red flags?? 

As a child I constantly wished to be seen as something different than my assigned gender, hated conforming to gender specific clothing and behavior, found it baffling when I watched others do it. I always had a hard time making friends with girls as a kid because I was just so not how they were, and we both knew it. The boys were more accepting but I was always disappointed when they would crushes on me instead of seeing me as one of the boys. As I got older and physically developed, others sexual attraction to me became more of a game, and I was always surprised when straight guys would like me but didn’t know how to explain that I felt more like a guy than a girl, although I was happy to be a girl most days? I eventually embraced my feminine side and became more comfortable with it but when I dress up, it feels far more like a fetishization than a true presentation, no matter how masc or femme I present. I accepted at an early age that some people were not the same gender that they were born as. I loved to play with peoples ideas of gender and norms and whatever. I’m very accepting of deviation from the gender norm in my social circle. Also as I’ve grown older, I became more and more interested and educated on feminism, which expanded my ideas and acceptance of others and myself.

But I have also had this deep seated internal prejudice/homophobia(?) against people who were assigned female at birth and claiming to be genderqueer. I hated making new friends with non-binary people and feeling like I was giving lip service when I said I supported them. And I do! But inside was a big tangled jumble of feelings about the whole thing, and ultimately I (privately) rejected the idea as a “real thing”. Which did not feel great. 

Somehow, last night it just clicked. I had a convo earlier with a young man who came out as gay recently and I told him that coming out is really a lifelong process, even to yourself. I was giggling later at a few times it went right over my head that why I was excited for somethings was because I was queer AF. And then, Lightbulb Moment. All the days of being seen as a girl that would send me home to  dress masc in private. My wish to be removed from gender and just be me without labels. My hero’s, my style icons. The stuff I like to do sexually. A friends very astute observation that I was more like a drag queen/cross dresser than a woman dressing up. The jarring moments I have when I am being hailed as a ma’am or a miss and how I just feel so thrown off by others perception of me. The fact that I’m married to a man but sometimes consider myself his gay, male lover (if only in my head). My adoration of my female presenting body as a separate entity. My feeling of embracing femininity as more of a war cry, “rah rah, women can do anything!” than a “rah, rah, I can do anything!”My quiet and deep jealousy for the seemingly effortlessly masc presenting people. My quiet and deep jealousy for the seemingly effortlessly femme presenting people. My deep and abiding attraction for NB/GQ and Trans people, often times before they are even “out” to myself or others. How I like to dress, speak and style myself androgynously.

So I came out as genderqueer to my three best friends (husband, cousin, BFF) last night. Although my husband doesn’t understand he is very supportive. My cousin also doesn’t understand but she also supports me to be whoever I am. My BFF said she could see it, that a part of me is not feminine or masculine and that’s just who I am. She also said that she thought I always knew this about myself XD. 

Now I feel a bit overwhelmed. I don’t think I’m ready or interested in changing anything socially in particular, but I also feel like I have this big juicy truth to explore and become a more authentic me. I have lots of questions that probably only I can answer....I want to release my internalized homophobia against others like myself, and I think that’s gonna start with being compassionate with the weirdo in the mirror and what they would like to do and be. Thanks for reading, this is like a huge secret I didn’t even know I had. I’m quite pleased to know that I’m just getting queerer with age.

I look fairly androgynous. Not just because I am trans, but it's just natural for me. I find androgynous people amazingly attractive too and in a way I am jealous of them... Like, when I was a ""guy"" (it's easier for me to talk about my gender identity/history this way) I was really jealous of bodies of androgynous men and women. 

Right now I'm pretty much an androgynous-leaning woman. I pass as woman IRL and have not very feminine, but not masculine either, body (feel free to look at my history if you want to see it).

2018-08-28 00:28:54,9aub3u,23,29,"Hi.  

I think I'm somewhere in the middle, maybe.  Growing up I always wanted to be a boy.  I played a boy in all the imaginary games I played with my friends.  From 1st grade onward I dressed as a boy and loved being ""miss-gendered.""  I was a pretty happy agender kid.  I've wondered, what if I was born 20 years later.  What if gender-queer was a thing when I was growing up (not saying it wasn't a term in 1995, I didn't even know anyone who was out and trans until college).  Since 9th grade, I've flirted with being more female, having long hair at times, wearing tight-fitted clothes.  

I want to be androgynous, I want people to look at me and not know my gender.  But I am more in the ""both genders"" than neither gender.  I got sir'd in an airport twice recently wearing a hoodie and pajama pants, but that's not something I'm going to wear to work.  I'm 5'4"" 145lbs, with shortly cropped hair, body hair, large breasts and an hourglass figure.  I mostly wear skirts because chronic pelvic pain doesn't really let me wear pants other than loose pajama pants.  I want to have skinny hips and small/no breasts and less body-fat, I worry though that if I didn't have breasts and hips I'd look fat.  I dress pretty feminine, dresses, skirts, because it looks good, and I can't wear pants.  If I wear clothes that cover my curves I look shabby and frumpy (the only being able to wear pajama pants doesn't help).  Pretty much I want to look like a thin girlish looking boy, but my body won't let me so instead I look like a butch girl in a dress.  I also really like cute dresses, and I like to be cute, bleh so many conflicting messages.

Also, I am in a masculine field, I have a lot of masculine hobbies.  I think it's important to be like fuck yeah, girls are here too, and we can be here and represent.  Like I'm constantly trying to prove, girls can do this, and that girls don't have follow beauty standards.  I feel like throwing away my gender would be giving in or being a bad feminist.  And I am a woman politically, woman's rights are incredibly important to me.  They are my rights, pregnancy, abortion, my body is female whether I want it to be or not.

Lastly it all seems like so much effort.  I'm not that open about being bi/pansexual and most people assume I'm straight.  (Like I told a friend of 6 years, last week, because it came up.)  I don't lie about it, I just don't work it into conversations because I don't know how.  I mean if I'm not actively putting it out there that I'm bi, don't always correct people's assumptions that I'm straight, and I know I've been bi since I heard the term at 14, am I really going to start correcting people's pronouns.

I'm new to this. I apologize if I seem biased or naive in anyway.  I don't know why I'm writing this.  Maybe because I don't know anyone who's genderqueer to talk to about this stuff, my partner can listen but not relate.
