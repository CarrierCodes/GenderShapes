So to make a long story short I've been looking up GQ/NB folks online to try and feel a bit less alone since I live in a conservative rural area and being out is like ""nope, not a chance"". I'm not really finding a lot of gender presentation that matches mine. There are a lot of AFAB enby folks who like short hair and makeup and that's awesome, you do you, but I'm not finding a lot of me out there and it's a bit lonely.

If I could point to my gender, I'd point to pretty boys from yaoi manga and video games. I have long hair and a feminine name (haven't changed it, not planning to for complex reasons), though I wear absolutely zero makeup (hate it!). Most people gender me as female though some seem to realize that's not quite right (including bullies back in my school days 20 years ago who used to like to call me 'manbeast'). I have a long list of 'stereotypically masculine' interests that involve playing video games and fixing things.

And I'm kind of like... OK where I'm at. I'm not considering HRT, in part due to a thyroid problem that needs continual monitoring, but also because my body's not been terrible to me... I don't have a huge chest, and on dysphoria days I can usually hide pretty well under a couple baggy layers. I even have a little bit of upper lip hair that I've grown to love.

Anyone else out there feel the same way? That they're fine with their birth name and presentation without social changes or medical intervention, but still strongly ID as GQ/NB?

So, I've identified as MTF for a long, long time.

I feel like, rather than being a woman, I'm more of a mostly feminine person trying to be a woman.

I've finally come to terms with myself; I'm non-binary.

If 1 is binary female, and 10 is binary male, then I'm a 4.

I don't really want to look like a man or a woman, but androgynous.

I feel weird saying that, but I look at porn~ let's call it art, or characters like that, and I can't help but feel like that's what I should be.

I've been out as a queer person for a couple years now, but recently got my name and gender marker changed on my ID, which led to a ton of questions from my friends - so maybe I wasn't as out as I thought. I crafted this letter and posted it on my FB and it got a lot of positive response from my cis friends who asked to share it with their other cis friends to be educated as well. 

Thought I'd share it here too. 

PSA: 

I have gone through expensive legal channels to change my name to Snarfy and I would like you to please start calling me Snarfy instead of Oldname.

The X on my ID stands for ""Non-Binary"" which means, to me, that I don't identify as a woman or a man, but somewhere outside of those/mix of both. The honorific for this is ""Mx."" which is pronounced as ""mix"". I am Mx. Lastname. ""Excuse me , Mx, is this your coat?"" 

I use they/them pronouns, which means that instead of using she/her or he/him when you talk about me, I would like you to use they/them. 

""This is Snarfy! They do my hair!""
""Oh, Snarfy left their phone behind, I do hope they come and get it!"" 
""Snarfy sent me a message, I wonder what they want?"" 

The gender neutral term for ""sister/brother"" is ""Sibling""
The gender neutral term that I use for ""aunt/uncle"" is ""Auncle"" 
The gender neutral term for ""niece/nephew"" is ""Nibling"" 
The gender neutral term for ""wife/husband"" is ""Spouse"" 
The gender neutral term I use for ""gf/bf"" is ""sweetie"" or ""babefriend"" 
The gender neutral term for ""mother/father"" is ""parent"" - but I still use mom/mama/mother because it feels right. 

Changing the way we talk about eachother and the way we talk about loved ones can be difficult at first, and it can take a lot of practice to get it right. It can feel overwhelming and like you keep making mistakes, but it's okay to make mistakes! Just correct yourself and move on. No need to make a fuss. I believe in you. &lt;3

2018-02-06 08:56:05,7vm3lv,2,3,"...and what do I do about it? 

My sex is female (AFAB). My gender identity is something I’ve been having a hard time defining. Having breasts (even though they are tiny/B-cup) frustrates and upsets me and doesn’t make me feel good about myself. I have tried binding before and the way it made my chest look was very affirming. However, I also have chronic shoulder/upper back/ribcage pain and so a binder is not doable on a regular basis (I can’t even wear bras regularly either b/c of this.) I have contemplated top surgery, which I would want to include nipple removal (is that even a thing??)
As far as expression, the gender binary is not something I fully identify with and I find it hard to put my “style” into a box. 99% of the time I just wear what is comfortable, I don’t wear makeup or do my hair... or put any thought into what gender I might be perceived as. But for super special occasions I gravitate towards the more “feminine” style. Sometimes I’ll even get my hair and makeup done, and although the process is a huge pain, I feel good about myself. (Minus the breasts always ruining everything). 
My facial structure is very naturally androgynous, and without makeup (which I hate wearing - mostly the whole process of it) I have had a couple people ask me if I am MTF trans. Doesn’t help that I’m super hairy/fuzzy - got those genes from my dad. 
I would like to do something about the hair, because I don’t like my body hair in general, and I was thinking of doing laser hair removal. But I also feel really confused about how I feel about my facial structure. I’ve started googling things like “afab hrt more feminine”... “cis androgynous female hormones for more feminine facial structure” &amp; etc. (even though I don’t truly identify with “cis” but idk what to call myself.) I’m finding a lot of genderqueer folks looking into HRT to become more androgynous. I haven’t found anyone who feels like I do...and it makes me feel like I don’t belong here, either. (As for how I feel about the rest of my body, I’m neutral about my bottom-sex-organs, but I have fantasized about having the opposite (or at least an artificial stand-in).) 

I’m so afraid that this is going to come across like I’m just some clueless/shallow cis girl who wants to look more feminine or “prettier”. That’s not me, though... it’s really hard to explain, but if anything I said sounds relatable to anyone out there, I’d love to talk...

my other friend was a lot more supportive (i was actually expecting him to freak out), when i told him he said ""I respect what you want too do with your life,aslong as you stay my friend"" and he was actually apologizing if he messes up (on names/pronouns ect.) which is more then i could really ask for and i really appreciate it.

anyway,skip 5 months later and i finally get internet again and i can talk to my friends (i havnt talked to them during this whole time and so i didnt know if they where actually trying to use the right pronouns for me,so i was kinda nervous). i knew that all my other friends didnt know i was trans and would still use she/her pronouns, i just kinda learned to deal with it. earlier today i was in a call with just friend 1, we where playing a game and called me she,i corrected him in a kinda sarcastic way (i was actually really nervous so i tried to cover with being sarcastic) and he called me 'it' in same sarcastic way, so i kinda tell him again ""i know i dont really say anything with __ or ___ in the call cause they dont know but im still trans""
he just said ok and he called me it again (sarcasticly again but still i didnt like it)
my other friend moved and doesnt have internet in his house so i have talked to him yet.

i just feel like he just ignored me coming out and continued using my old pronouns and didnt actually try to understand or take me seriously. i've known friend one since 3rd grade (we are both 10th graders) so i get that changing can be a little hard to get used to but its just frustrating.


this isnt really the first time something like this happend,
when i came out as gay (aka lesbian, i didnt like saying i was a lesbian,guess now i know why)
he kept saying i liked guys or make sexual things to/about me with guys as a ""joke"" when i tried to tell him i didnt like that he just said ""well im gonna keep doing it cause your reactions are funny"" he eventually did stop when i just left the call/group when he made those ""jokes""

i feel like the only way he is gonna take this seriously is if he just cant ignore it anymore (starting,getting top surgery, finally passing ect.)
i was thinking making a re-coming out letter just to like tell him again that i'm trans and i would appricate it if he would use he/him pronouns for me (i dont know what to do about our other friends that we both hang out with that dont know) but i dont know if i should, i might just be overreacting.",genderqueer,no one is gonna take me seriously then why even bother?,1518001061.0,"{'created_utc': 1517975861, 'id': '7vtefx', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 3, 'selftext': 'i came out as trans ftm (technically i\'m nonbinary/trans masc but trans ftm is easier to explain i guess) to my 2 close friends in september. it went better then i thought. one of my friends (ill call him friend 1)reaction was pretty underwhelming? i guess, he just commented on a joke i put in my coming out message and thats it. when i asked ""your ok with this?"" he just replied ""yeah of course,your my friend, like i said,you do you,ill do me"" so just assumed he was ok with it\n\nmy other friend was a lot more supportive (i was actually expecting him to freak out), when i told him he said ""I respect what you want too do with your life,aslong as you stay my friend"" and he was actually apologizing if he messes up (on names/pronouns ect.) which is more then i could really ask for and i really appreciate it.\n\nanyway,skip 5 months later and i finally get internet again and i can talk to my friends (i havnt talked to them during this whole time and so i didnt know if they where actually trying to use the right pronouns for me,so i was kinda nervous). i knew that all my other friends didnt know i was trans and would still use she/her pronouns, i just kinda learned to deal with it. earlier today i was in a call with just friend 1, we where playing a game and called me she,i corrected him in a kinda sarcastic way (i was actually really nervous so i tried to cover with being sarcastic) and he called me \'it\' in same sarcastic way, so i kinda tell him again ""i know i dont really say anything with __ or ___ in the call cause they dont know but im still trans""\nhe just said ok and he called me it again (sarcasticly again but still i didnt like it)\nmy other friend moved and doesnt have internet in his house so i have talked to him yet.\n\ni just feel like he just ignored me coming out and continued using my old pronouns and didnt actually try to understand or take me seriously. i\'ve known friend one since 3rd grade (we are both 10th graders) so i get that changing can be a little hard to get used to but its just frustrating.\n\n\nthis isnt really the first time something like this happend,\nwhen i came out as gay (aka lesbian, i didnt like saying i was a lesbian,guess now i know why)\nhe kept saying i liked guys or make sexual things to/about me with guys as a ""joke"" when i tried to tell him i didnt like that he just said ""well im gonna keep doing it cause your reactions are funny"" he eventually did stop when i just left the call/group when he made those ""jokes""\n\ni feel like the only way he is gonna take this seriously is if he just cant ignore it anymore (starting,getting top surgery, finally passing ect.)\ni was thinking making a re-coming out letter just to like tell him again that i\'m trans and i would appricate it if he would use he/him pronouns for me (i dont know what to do about our other friends that we both hang out with that dont know) but i dont know if i should, i might just be overreacting.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'no one is gonna take me seriously then why even bother?', 'created': 1518001061.0}"

I got into a bit of an argument today regarding how my dearest friend thought of trans women... She's a feminist of the Jermaine Greer fangirl variety. I was a little disgusted by the venom in her voice and when I questioned her she told me that a 'man' has no right to tell her how to be a feminist...
I have Autistic Syndrome Disorder and it's been playing havoc with my speech skills for years. I couldn't get the right words out. I couldn't get her to think about it from the perspective I was trying to look from... So I hung up the phone. Weeped a little and composed... Well this.

&gt; 💜💛💚💙❤  So... 

I've changed a lot and not at all in the last two years. June 2016 I discovered a new word that suddenly opened up a future for me. Instead of looking into the future and seeing a grey old man with a miserable smile I suddenly saw a bright, beaming silver-haired creature. I saw a vision of my future that had some genuine happiness in it. That was it. I wouldn't hold back.
I'm non-binary. A trans person. Born male and for twenty odd years trapped in a definition which stifled and corroded me.
Now personally I don't give a damn what most people think of me... Otherwise I'd never be able to rest - ""Blokes don't wear makeup!"" ""How can you be both?"" ""What the fuck is that?!"" I got past that kind of shit in high school, 'crime against nature' and whatnot.

Where this philosophy breaks down is with the people I love and adore. My family; for the most part willing to at least listen and accept it. My friends; no trouble there, misfits and reprobates the lot of them... But that's all directed at me.

I'm not worried about me. My personality might be gentle but it's unyielding. What makes me cry is the idea that the people I love, that the woman I admire the most might not accept those who come after me. The little boys who grow up and discover their body betraying them, bleeding against their will. The little girls who are barred from their peers because they can't experience being a woman without the 'right' parts. The adorable creatures who see the binary and know they don't belong there deep in their queer little hearts.

I don't know if you'll read this as you've voluntarily taken yourself away from this boring blue site but maybe it'll reach you. I hope it does, you know better than anyone I'm much better at writing this stuff down than trying to finagle it from my disobedient tongue.

I cry everytime I think I might not be able to make a difference for the kids that grow up from here on.
That someone my age or beyond might advocate hate or simply not accept these children for what they are.

I want this world, my world, my tiny little corner of Tasmania to be a safer place for them.

I'm queer, transgender and extraordinarily okay with it. 
Anyone who has a problem with that... Bring it on.
Anyone who accepts that without hesitation... Bring your love.
Anyone who wants to understand... Bring an open mind.

And anyone who can't see past a parroted line of rhetoric from an Elder constantly looking at the past... I hope you find your own voice deep down one day.

Thank you. ❤💙💚💛💜

However, they're all techs. As an actor, I run into a lot of weird issues like not wanting to attend gendered vocal warmups, choosing fitting parts for auditions, and the way I view theatrical literature. I decided that it was time for me to come out to the director, someone who has been a supporter of mine for years. 

""Hey, Josh?""

""Hey, what's up?"" 

Oh boy. ""Do you...do you know what gender non-binary is?"" 

""I do know what that is."" OH THANK GOD 

""Well, that- I- That's me. I'm non-binary."" 

He turned from his laptop and smiled. ""I'm in a weird place because I don't want to say I made assumptions, because it's not really right to try and assume things-"" 

""It's okay, just say it."" I laughed a little. 

""Well, I think that identity suits you as a person. It makes sense. You were never one for labels."" 

""I mean, you're right."" Wow. Okay. In the clear. 

""What are your pronouns?"" Oh my gosh, yes. Yes yes yes thank you. I answered. 

We talked a little about my view on gender as a philosophy and about practices in our department. I'm a senior now and I have a lot of influence in the department, and the director commended me for being an advocate for other students when I mentioned that I wanted to make a difference for them since I was super uncomfortable in certain situations. He thanked me for trusting him with this information and told me to be completely honest to him when something needed to be changed. 

Overall, I'm just really happy. I've needed to do this for a few years, and I wish I hadn't waited until being quiet had become unbearable.

As an actor, I run into a lot of weird issues like not wanting to attend gendered vocal warmups, choosing fitting parts for auditions, and the way I view theatrical literature. I decided that it was time for me to come out to the director, someone who has been a supporter of mine for years. \n\n""Hey, Josh?""\n\n""Hey, what\'s up?"" \n\nOh boy. ""Do you...do you know what gender non-binary is?"" \n\n""I do know what that is."" OH THANK GOD \n\n""Well, that- I- That\'s me. I\'m non-binary."" \n\nHe turned from his laptop and smiled. ""I\'m in a weird place because I don\'t want to say I made assumptions, because it\'s not really right to try and assume things-"" \n\n""It\'s okay, just say it."" I laughed a little. \n\n""Well, I think that identity suits you as a person. It makes sense. You were never one for labels."" \n\n""I mean, you\'re right."" Wow. Okay. In the clear. \n\n""What are your pronouns?"" Oh my gosh, yes. Yes yes yes thank you. I answered. \n\nWe talked a little about my view on gender as a philosophy and about practices in our department. I\'m a senior now and I have a lot of influence in the department, and the director commended me for being an advocate for other students when I mentioned that I wanted to make a difference for them since I was super uncomfortable in certain situations. He thanked me for trusting him with this information and told me to be completely honest to him when something needed to be changed. \n\nOverall, I\'m just really happy. I\'ve needed to do this for a few years, and I wish I hadn\'t waited until being quiet had become unbearable.

My mind seems to have a block when trying to frame they or them as a singular pronoun.  Unfortunately, I now feel like I'm constantly walking on eggshells around this coworker, and have been corrected a couple of times already, despite my best efforts to adjust.  I am constantly afraid of offending them (FYI: had to correct my typing here), and now another coworker has decided to ask others to use they/them as well.

There is just something that feels inherently wrong about having to police my speech so intensely when I've been raised to speak my mind and not let others tell you how to talk.  I realize that my constant fears of being called out or possibly even written up for my ""language transgressions"" may pale in comparison to the hardships that queer folks face on a daily basis, but I am just not sure what to do.  Even when I catch myself and use the proper pronouns I end up confusing myself because holding the singular and plural in my head at the same time is so bizarre.

Anyways, just trying to get some advice on how to deal with this besides ""just keep trying your best and eventually you will be properly conditioned out of your chauvinistic ways"".  Either way, it felt good to vent my frustrations.

2018-02-15 15:25:10,7xr1tm,4,26,"The Scottish Government is currently consulting on proposed changes to Gender Recognition.

The main points are:

* **Self declaration**  
Let trans people get official recognition of their gender without the current requirement of a psychiatric report.
* **16-17 year olds**  
Let trans people apply for gender recognition from 16, the age at which young people in Scotland are deemed to have full legal capacity.
* **Non-binary**  
Let non-binary people have their gender fully legally recognised through self-declaration.

This consultation is **vital** and closes on the 1 March at 17:00 (GMT). If the Scottish Gov gets more negative responses than positive ones it will be extremely difficult for them to justify updating legal gender recognition. If the number of negative responses is large then the rights of trans people are at risk of being rolled back, not only in Scotland but also in the whole of the UK.

**Most unfortunately, the media has been particularly hostile about trans equality in recent weeks and so there is a REAL RISK that this negative media coverage will encourage a larger number of negative responses. So now more than ever we need people to respond to the consultation!**

Please take 10 min to complete a positive response. You can find a guide and link to the consultation at

**http://equalrecognition.scot/consultation/**

Not all the questions need to be answered. Even saying something simple like “I support trans rights” already helps. They do ask for a name and e-mail address but these can be kept confidential.

Responses from outside of Scotland/UK are also welcome - a lot of the negative responses come from transphobes around the world.",genderqueer,Scottish non-binary people need your help! | Government Consultation on Equal Recognition (Open to ALL),1518733510.0,"{'created_utc': 1518708310, 'id': '7xr1tm', 'num_comments': 4, 'score': 26, 'selftext': 'The Scottish Government is currently consulting on proposed changes to Gender Recognition.\n\nThe main points are:\n\n* **Self declaration**  \nLet trans people get official recognition of their gender without the current requirement of a psychiatric report.\n* **16-17 year olds**  \nLet trans people apply for gender recognition from 16, the age at which young people in Scotland are deemed to have full legal capacity.\n* **Non-binary**  \nLet non-binary people have their gender fully legally recognised through self-declaration.\n\nThis consultation is **vital** and closes on the 1 March at 17:00 (GMT).

2018-02-17 21:48:02,7y9q7o,14,41,"I just subscribed and I figured I'd introduce myself. (and also send out my rather desperate cry for help.)  I'm AFAB and about to turn 40.  I definitely don't feel like a woman (but don't really feel like a man either), but my current life doesn't allow me to present myself as anything other than a ""normal"" straight cisgender woman.  I live in the Bible Belt and I have very close-minded family members.  I'll try not to go into too many details, but in brief, my family responded with utter disgust and hatred way back in my early 20s when I first started dating women and presenting myself in a more masculine way.  Emotional abuse throughout my childhood had crippled me mentally, emotionally, and socially, and I wasn't able to find the strength or independence to be myself and ignore the haters.  I retreated back into the proverbial closet and turned to various forms of religious extremism to try to ""straighten"" myself out.  Now, here I am nearly 40.  I have two children from a miserable marriage to a man that I could barely stand to have sex with.  I love my children dearly, but trying to be ""motherly"" to them forces me to keep up this charade of femininity that is killing me.  Plus, I've done a lot of crazy things in my life, largely due to all the crap I've dealt with from my manipulative and hateful family members, and my parents have used this against me (plus a lot of exaggerations and flat-out lies) to get legal guardianship of my kids.  So the only way I can be with my children is for me and the kids to live with my parents.  I have to keep being the person my parents want me to be.  (My mother is so easily offended that she actually thinks watching NCIS is unbearable because it has ""too much sex."")  Plus, I've finally held down a respectable job for a year, and I can't risk doing anything scandalous to lose that job.  Without it, I'd lose my only possible route to independence.  So I'm stuck pretending to be someone I'm not.  One of the biggest agonies for me is my breasts.  After two pregnancies and breast-feeding, they are these two big, saggy monstrosities that feel like mutations or tumors.  Don't get me wrong.  I LOVE breasts, when they belong to someone else! But I DESPISE having them attached to my body.  I wear sports bras, which is the closest I can get to a binder without freaking anyone out.  My daughter is only 7 and has this obsession with me having long curly hair, and although I desperately want to shave my head, I have to keep my hair long to avoid breaking her heart.  She even loves to play with my hair, although I can barely stand to have anyone touch my hair (or any of me).  Sometimes it makes me twitch to be touched.  I'm very hairy for a woman, and I have to constantly remove the hair on my face to avoid having a beard.  I wish I could just let it grow.  But my family can barely even stomach the fact that I don't shave my legs or pits.  I work in retail and thus have to interact with co-workers and customers constantly, which throws me into excruciating existential agony, because this bubbly, feminine little gal with an annoyingly high-pitched voice is completely not who I really am.  The more I connect with people, the more I see and hear and feel that person I'm presenting myself as, and the more the cognitive dissonance rips me in half.  It's killing me to not recognize my own self.  The only ""me"" that feels real is that disembodied inner voice that becomes loud and clear when I'm in bed at night, my eyes closed to the outside world, as I lie still and can minimize the sensations of my bizarre and unfamiliar body.  And to top it all off, I'm horribly lonely and sex-starved.  I haven't been intimate with a woman in 17 years.  During the decade that I was living with me husband, we hardly ever had sex, because we basically hated each other most of those years, and I can't stand sex with men anyway.  In the seven years since we split up, my children and I have been living with my parents, so sex has mostly been out of the question, because my parents only allow me to either be at home, at work, or running errands for them.  I managed to have sex with two different men, for a total of less than 5 sexual encounters altogether over the course of seven years.  And I didn't enjoy it, because, well, they weren't women.  But I was desperate.  I don't even really have enough privacy to do much in the way of masturbating.  When I do, I end up miserable afterward because it inevitably serves as just one more affirmation of my possession of a female anatomy.  And I can't get help from any mental health professionals around here.  They're all so backward that they still consider it a symptom of severe mental illness to have any sort of sexual orientation or gender identity that doesn't conform to the ideals of Christian conservatives.  My case worker at a state-funded mental health facility actually once prayed over me, and I've been told by an emergency room mental health care provider that I was on my way to hell.  I'm much stronger now than I used to be, and I'm not giving up or attempting suicide, but I'm just really effing tired.",genderqueer,"Sorry this is so long, but having to pretend to be someone I'm not is killing me inside",1518929282.0,"{'created_utc': 1518904082, 'id': '7y9q7o', 'num_comments': 14, 'score': 41, 'selftext': 'I just subscribed and I figured I\'d introduce myself.

Plus, I\'ve finally held down a respectable job for a year, and I can\'t risk doing anything scandalous to lose that job.  Without it, I\'d lose my only possible route to independence.  So I\'m stuck pretending to be someone I\'m not.  One of the biggest agonies for me is my breasts.  After two pregnancies and breast-feeding, they are these two big, saggy monstrosities that feel like mutations or tumors.  Don\'t get me wrong.  I LOVE breasts, when they belong to someone else! But I DESPISE having them attached to my body.  I wear sports bras, which is the closest I can get to a binder without freaking anyone out.  My daughter is only 7 and has this obsession with me having long curly hair, and although I desperately want to shave my head, I have to keep my hair long to avoid breaking her heart.  She even loves to play with my hair, although I can barely stand to have anyone touch my hair (or any of me).  Sometimes it makes me twitch to be touched.  I\'m very hairy for a woman, and I have to constantly remove the hair on my face to avoid having a beard.  I wish I could just let it grow.  But my family can barely even stomach the fact that I don\'t shave my legs or pits.  I work in retail and thus have to interact with co-workers and customers constantly, which throws me into excruciating existential agony, because this bubbly, feminine little gal with an annoyingly high-pitched voice is completely not who I really am.  The more I connect with people, the more I see and hear and feel that person I\'m presenting myself as, and the more the cognitive dissonance rips me in half.  It\'s killing me to not recognize my own self.  The only ""me"" that feels real is that disembodied inner voice that becomes loud and clear when I\'m in bed at night, my eyes closed to the outside world, as I lie still and can minimize the sensations of my bizarre and unfamiliar body.  And to top it all off, I\'m horribly lonely and sex-starved.  I haven\'t been intimate with a woman in 17 years.  During the decade that I was living with me husband, we hardly ever had sex, because we basically hated each other most of those years, and I can\'t stand sex with men anyway.  In the seven years since we split up, my children and I have been living with my parents, so sex has mostly been out of the question, because my parents only allow me to either be at home, at work, or running errands for them.  I managed to have sex with two different men, for a total of less than 5 sexual encounters altogether over the course of seven years.  And I didn\'t enjoy it, because, well, they weren\'t women.  But I was desperate.  I don\'t even really have enough privacy to do much in the way of masturbating.  When I do, I end up miserable afterward because it inevitably serves as just one more affirmation of my possession of a female anatomy.  And I can\'t get help from any mental health professionals around here.  They\'re all so backward that they still consider it a symptom of severe mental illness to have any sort of sexual orientation or gender identity that doesn\'t conform to the ideals of Christian conservatives.  My case worker at a state-funded mental health facility actually once prayed over me, and I\'ve been told by an emergency room mental health care provider that I was on my way to hell.  I\'m much stronger now than I used to be, and I\'m not giving up or attempting suicide, but I\'m just really effing tired.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': ""Sorry this is so long, but having to pretend to be someone I'm not is killing me inside"", 'created': 1518929282.0}"
2018-02-18 11:41:24,7ydrwx,7,21,"hey, I'm non binary, I'm considering transition towards male, there's a situation I would like to share with you, to find out if I'm not alone. 

Disclaimer: I live in a very conservative town 

Ever since I've cut my hair (I'm a 'girl'), I've feel like people think I'm a weirdo or something. Every time I go out people stare(but not positives stares). I feel like every single person who passes by hates me because I'm gender non conforming. 

I've had people saying to me that they knew me, or they had seen me before, somewhere else. A person that I encountered for the first time ever, (friend of a friend) said she knew who I was. Isn't it creepy? this has happened a few times. I've had people of my school knowing my name without me knowing them. (probably because there's facebook, but, I mean...)

I can understand that there are people who like this kind of 'attention', but I don't. I never liked being an outsider or something, and I like when no one notices me. Which is the opposite of what happens. If it was positive attention, if people were genuinely interested in me because they liked me, I would be happy, no problem.

But I feel 'observed'. Every move I take, every time I go grocery shopping, the normal activities, etc. people stare and probably think: - oh is it a boy or a girl? what a shame. Is she like, trans? or a lesbian?-

What irritates me the most is not the fact that people might talk about me behind my back, but the fact that all they see is a girl who is 'trying' to be weird and eccentric. While I should be a boy, my name should be Kevin, but no one will ever see me as that for two years. (because i can't come out until I'm independent from my family, and I'm still questioning everything).

I was born female and up until recently I’ve identified that way, but lately I’ve been really wondering what my gender/gender identity truly is.
So, all my life I’ve been actively attempting to dress/look like a guy. I didn’t realize I was doing this until about a month ago. Even as a kid I’d do this. I love suits and ties and sneakers and vests. I hate dresses and pink and frilly stuff. I used to ask my mom if I looked handsome when I was very young, and she’d always correct me and say only boys can look handsome. Now I’m twenty and she routinely shouts at me for ‘trying to dress like a boy’, and I honestly had no clue what she was talking about until recently. 
I didn’t realize it. Every Halloween and at every comic con, I pick a male character just so I have an excuse to wear their clothes. And I have always felt more comfortable in men’s clothing in general, whether that’s T-shirt’s or polos or boxers or whatever.

On the way into the fitting room (which I think was the one technically meant for women, being that side of a very narrow store and having girl clothes hanging on the outside of the doors and on the reject area), I saw a bikini bottom on the floor and picked it up and said ""Oh, that's cute.""

Well, after spending a couple minutes in the girl jeans pondering how they fit (which I bought by the way) and leaving the fitting room, I looked at the bikini bottom that I picked up and thought ""Hmm, should I?""

So for years now, it has been clear to me that I have a wish my genitals were different. It took a while to figure this out. Initially I had a fascination with transitioning which I couldn’t explain. Crossdressing or living as a member of the opposite sex though was not really of interest to me. By further exploring the whole thing and by finding out  that there are FTM guys and also „nullos“ out there,  I slowly realized that this is how I’d like to be.

I don’t really have dysphoria feelings for my body or genitals. I enjoy having a beard, body hair and living as a male person. I also don’t hate my cock but I would prefer I just had a hole/„pussy“ there instead.  And it’s almost essential to think that in order to achieve an orgasm. I have also wasted hours of „research“ about how this could become reality.

Sessions with therapists haven’t brought a lot because usually it ends up with them trying to persuade me I am a woman or that I have some form of body integrity disorder which doesn’t feel to be the case for me. I have also talked to my ex about this but he didn’t really seem to get it and ended up making fun of me.

Has any of you experienced similar feelings? Do you have any suggestions about how to deal with this?

2018-02-25 20:55:33,807dve,11,24,"I am female, but I have never fit with the word “girl”. I don’t feel like I belong to my own gender. I see girls showing such a pride of being women, then I have tried to seek that in myself, but it just isn’t there.

I have always felt like there aren’t actual differences (beyond biological ones) between men and women, not even psychologically, because I have always felt closer to a boy than a girl, then I thought: “If I looked like a boy, nobody would question my identity even for a moment, since my behaviour is so alike boys’ behaviour; then it’s probably an outdated thing thinking that men and women have differences other than pure biological ones”. Because of this, I have always defined myself just a person, not a boy or a girl. But people tell me that psychologically the two genders do have differences. So maybe it means something, that I feel so closer to a boy, and maybe the fact isn’t that men and women don’t have differences, but that deep down I am a boy.

When I was a child, I used to dislike those I was taught were “girls colours”, as I used to dislike skirts and anything “girls-related”, and I keep doing it: I am fifteen and a half, and I don’t feel attracted to makeup at all, nor to any other sort of “girls thing”. Obviously being a woman goes way further than wearing liptick and pretty dresses, I am totally aware of it, in facts the most important point is that I can’t find any sensation inside myself which tells me “o yeah, that’s feeling woman”. Even my friends often tell me the only thing that’s between me and being a boy is a penis, and I am pleased when they tell me so, I really like that. It makes me feel good with myself. My mother tells me that having me is like having a boy as well. I love this.

What really made me move from the “I just feel a person” to the “I could be a boy” is noticing that, whenever I am in a clothes shop, I feel the urge to go to the side where boy clothing is. I really feel the necessity to go there and buy boys t-shirts, boys trousers, boys shoes… The idea of doing this makes me incredibly happy, and imagining myself with short hair and boys clothes makes me feel good as well. Til now I used to tell myself: “Women can prefer short hair and boys clothes and call themselver women, and men can wear makeup and dresses and polish their nails and call themselves men; you are just being a person”. But since I feel that good with myself even just at the thought of looking like a boy, and since I feel strange, unconfortable, a bit empty, a bit disappointed wearing girly clothes, and I absolutely can’t stand wearing dresses, makeup, nail polish and stuff, maybe it’s not just a matter of style. I don’t really care about how I dress up too, I just want to feel comfortable, and I feel very comfortable when people recognize me as a boy, as I have already told you. Anything that could make me be seen as a girl makes me upset, and I keep myself afar from it. It’s been like this since when I was a child.

Last but not least important, I want to clarify that the matter isn’t the clothing itself, since I believe clothes shouldn’t even be labelled as “men’s” or “women’s”, but it’s about the feelings this makes me feel.

What do you think about it?

P.S. I don’t live this as a problem, I am not that worried. I strongly believe anything that’s human is natural and absolutely right and worth of respect. I am seeking your help and asking your opinion because I want to enrich myself getting to know me and, as a fifteen years older who lives with a pretty close minded and xenophobe environment, I need to get in touch with outsiders who have a less outdated mentality to grow.

As a teenager, I am seeking myself, and I am quite confused. I could even discover I fit more in the word “girl” than expected, and this is what I fear most. I can’t really explain why.

I think that’s the perk of being alive: you never know.

We could be so many things that we never know who we truly are until we agree to jump into the dark well of uncertainity, questioning the whole nature of our reality.

Still, I am a bit scared of not knowing something everyone takes for granted: penis = man, vagina = woman.

2018-02-25 22:42:46,8084of,16,4,"First off, I totally made this account as a throwaway and got excited when the username was available. Victory.

I've had a period for 15 years and have never liked it. I was on the birth control pill from age 16 to 21 and loved the light or nearly non-existent periods I had. Everything felt more physically natural about my body at this time in my life before I started exploring my gender, that is until I ragequit taking the pill after realizing it was supporting my depression and I hated remembering to take it and freaking out when I may have forgotten.

Fast forward to today, I am sitting here dreading the monthly mess after getting a reminder from my tracking app that my period is about to come. My periods are what I would consider normal right now for a vegan, relatively active body with a copper IUD in place in my uterus. But I keep thinking, did I jump on my bike and spin enough times this month to keep it light? Will my period ruin an exciting week of hanging out with my mom and my partner's birthday weekend? Am I packing enough tampons?

*Side story - I'm in my late 20s and just discovered how awesome tampons are for my period-centric gender dysphoria. It hides everything I don't want to see during the day.*

**So here's where I'm at:**

I don't want to go on a hormonal birth control or any form of hormone or drug that would change my body. I'm really cool with my body besides having a period.

As far as I know based on what I've done in the past, regular exercise, a diet that includes lots of whole foods and lacks alcohol, plenty of daily water, yoga during my period, has all worked together to keep my period light. I'm totally ok with doing all these things. I love feeling how these decisions change my body naturally.

**What I want to ask:**

**Does anyone else have an experience like this?** I just need to be exposed to other experiences similar to mine. I'm having trouble finding anything like what I've been going through. Most stories end up with people deciding on physical changes to ease or eliminate dysphoria, and while that's great for them I am not interested in those changes. But if that's your story and a part of your story is similar, please share!

**Are there any holistic recommendations to ease menstruation symptoms that have worked for you?** I suppose this could include manifestation or tricking my mind, but I haven't yet tried to see how powerful my mind really is over my body.

I've been really hurting over this for a few years, and now that I've gotten rid of my depression and have a pretty darn good life going for myself, I want to focus on some of the things I have been barely coping with. Thank you for reading and sharing if you do!

I've been really into controlling my body since puberty (by not eating enough, as a teen, seguing nicely into exercise addiction in my twenties). I'm still a vain gym rat. I'm AFAB but long to look like a tall, finely muscled androgynous-tilting-masculine warrior prince. (Laughing at myself a little, but also serious.) 

How much of this, I wonder, is gender dysphoria that could be lessened, if not alleviated altogether, by some degree of medically assisted transition? How much of this is an broader inability to Love My Body as I would tell a friend or a loved one to do?

Specifically I mean to bring up my eating disorder: Anorexia Athletica. This disorder is categorized as the lack of caloric intake for the amount of energy one expends on a hourly to daily basis. I feel like I need to hone in my eating disorder and would like to touch more on my practice of Tibetan Buddhism, as well as feel comfortable in my body through healthy exercise routines and hone in my diet which should not consist what I currently put into it, due to allergies and a desire to be a vegetarian.

That being said, I can't differentiate between body dysmorphia and body dysphoria sometimes and I was wondering what you guys do to deal with it, if you have it, and what holistically you may have done to achieve clarity between the two.

So,  help?

so i've been spending all of my time trying to either dress male or hyper feminine. swinging between baggy jeans and hoodies to dresses and nail polish and makeup which i never wear. 

i was a tomboy as a kid. and now im wearing dresses but thinking that i am crossdressing. 

and what sucks the most is that all of my efforts to dress male still read feminine, and me in a dress is just what girls do. it's impossible for me to read as male. one of my good friends is transfeminine and she worries about passing which i know is hard but i cant even begin to pass because the goddam patriarchy made male clothes default and being a femme male is impossible. ]
