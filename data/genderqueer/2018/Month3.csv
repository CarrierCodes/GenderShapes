Left pic is 0 months HRT. Right pic is 6 months HRT (today).

Hey, so I'm a 31 year old Enby AMAB person. I've been on low dose HRT (androgen blockers and estrogen) for the past 6 months now and think I'm starting to look less masculine. I also think I maybe look a bit younger.

It's hard to be sure that any possible changes aren't just imagined/wishful thinking though and I'd love an honest opinion. Thanks.

2018-03-02 22:58:46,81jib0,2,9,"Okay, diving in. I'm 35 years old and assigned male at birth. I decided I was gay when I was around 10 and changed that to queer a few years ago — partly because I realized not everyone I'm attracted to identified as a man and partly because I felt increasingly alienated from mainstream cis gay men. I'm not entirely sure when I first began to wonder if I'm not a cis man myself but I began to consider the question in earnest a few months ago. I found the possibility surprisingly exciting and there seemed to be ample evidence.

Some examples of that evidence:
- I've never felt very comfortable in designated male spaces (locker rooms, men's bathrooms, etc.) and I've never particularly enjoyed being considered ""one of the guys"" as it seemed an awkward fit.
- At High School, all my friends were women (though as an adult it's been all gay men) and I've always hated sports and recoiled from traditionally masculine behavior.
- In recent years, I've grown increasingly bored with much of the clothing marketed to men; it's often repetitively styled, limited to plain colors and patterns, and generally downright boring. I've been searching out more color, florals, and unusual patterns to the point of incorporating some ""women's"" clothing into my wardrobe.
- For a while now I've found myself fantasizing about living in a society with indigenous/precolonized gender roles because then I could ""just have a sensible third gender.""

For most of my life, I've packed a lot of that into the gay identity but as I got older and ""gay"" began to be more clearly differentiated as strictly a sexual orientation I've wondered where that left my gender nonconforming behavior. I got by with ""queer"" for a while. But then something changed.

One drunken weekend night about a month ago, I shared with my husband that I wondered if I wasn't some flavor of nonbinary. The next day I thought about how I'd blame the booze and walk that back...and then I didn't. Instead, I told more people, and began actively exploring the possibility. The results have been encouraging. I bought more clothing marketed to women and started finding opportunities to wear more gender-mixed attire. I reopened my ear piercings from my 20s and started wearing all kinds of earrings. I've spent so much at Sephora, I've probably put them into the black for the year. I've been enjoying the hell out of all of this. I really like when my appearance feels like a mashup of different gender expressions. I've started having little moments of unexpected delight, like when I see my lipstick imprint on a glass of wine. Once when I came home from work and stripped off my traditionally-male work clothes, I somehow felt better just being naked. Sometimes I look at my cis male friends and mentally set myself aside as another gender and feel a sense of relief to no longer be comparing myself to them.

I've spoken to some trans acquaintances — including a nonbinary person — and a lot of this sounded familiar to them. One even said outright, ""sweetie, you're not cis."" The writing does appear to be on the wall at this point but I suppose I still have doubts. Thirty-five seems awfully late to discover something this big about myself. I'm fine with my body the way it is (though I wouldn't mind getting it in a little better shape). And I'm not sure I've always felt this way. Looking back, there are possible hints but it still feels a bit like it's come out of the blue and that doesn't really sound like so many of the trans narratives I've read. Is it possible that the seeds of this were always there, dormant because of internalized misogyny or whatever, until I nurtured them and now they're blooming? Or have I just...changed? Have I been confusing who I am with who I'm attracted to until now? Does it even matter or is it possible something else is going on and I'm misattributing it? I asked my husband, ""What if I'm not nonbinary and I just want to be?"" and he asked ""What's the difference?""

Browsing this subreddit (first time lol) I realized that I should've realized this a long time ago but here I am. Anyways, I needed to get this off my chest, so here we go:

I've always felt incredible discomfort with the way I've been treated throughout my life growing up afab, and the great deal of pain that comes along with it. I never had the language to even begin to comprehend and approach the painful things that were commonplace, every day ordeals for me, or to understand what was going on, or why certain things happened, or are believed. Having expectations I never wanted forced onto me under the guise of guidance into true womanhood and a right way of living. 

I feel like as soon as I found out I could separate my identity and my being from the struggles that come with being a woman in a patriarchal society, I latched onto that in an attempt to escape the way I'm treated and the way I'm forced to think about myself as a woman. I wanted to leave my oppression behind and take control over something I was never given the choice not to embody. My genderqueer identity is a reaction to and an escape from the widespread hatred of my assigned gender, a miraculous 3rd answer to a question that's supposed to have only two.

But after writing this, and after more introspection, I can also say that it's not just sexism that's responsible for my identity. I am still very much genderqueer regardless, and after learning more about myself, I feel proud of my development as a person and how I continue to grow into my identity and become a better version of myself than I ever have been.

I am still very much genderqueer regardless, and after learning more about myself, I feel proud of my development as a person and how I continue to grow into my identity and become a better version of myself than I ever have been. I love being genderqueer and I love myself.\n\nThanks for reading :) "", 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': ""I feel like this should've been obvious from the start"", 'created': 1520169508.0}"

The thing is, I don't feel any strong urge to come out to everyone I know. I'm pretty content to just present the way I want to present and otherwise kind of fly under the radar. I'm AFAB, so it's fairly socially acceptable for me to wear menswear (or at least more so than it would be for an AMAB doing the reverse), so it's not like there's some huge need to explain things.  

I'm also not too bothered about pronouns. Sometimes they chafe a little, but I mostly just don't pay too much attention to them. I think part of it is that I'm not sure what pronouns I'd like to use, even if I did ask people to change them!

But I also don't feel very comfortable announcing it to the world. More than that, I don't really feel the *need* to. People can see I'm androgynous, and that's enough for me.

That said, I'd also be lying if I tried to pretend like I'm not afraid of the social stigma.

TL;DR: How do I properly start to get my 'message' out, without feeling afraid of the naysayers that may actually want to commit violence unto me and my people?

Detail:

Alright, long story short, I've been through what I now personally consider to be relatively major bouts of depression, high school was a specifically trying time for me. I had issues with feelings of loneliness, neglect and just generally not feeling like people understood me, or even worse, didn't even care to understand me.

I've been having major ideas on how I want to approach this situation. Specifically when it comes to social media. Youtube, blogging, Tumblr bullshit, Facebook groups, all of that. I would like to know if you all have any input on how I should start, what I should look out for, yadda yadda.

There are certain people that are still in a very bigoted and violent place, and my main concern is that if I share too much, or don't properly cover my ass, some asshole with computer skills and a penchant for violence could hurt me and/or my family.

As a person with breasts who sometimes does not want them (I have what my therapist likes to call situational boob) I am considering breast reduction. 

I have very large breasts (38 j) and have had them since I was 10. I have had a love hate relationship with them my whole life, especially since ""hatching"" to my nb identity 4 months ago. I hate the way they enter the room before me and the way people automatically gender me when they see them. I have a binder that just kind of reduces me rn and some days that's enough. I run the gamut of being ok with them, wanting them to look smaller, to wanting them to be completely flat. Some days I wake up and feel fem, some days I wake up and feel masc., but most days I just feel both enough that I cancel out. I feel like having a smaller chest might make it easier to bind and deal with my fluctuating dysphoria.

I just feel kind of strange about it because when most afab enbys talk about surgery all they mean is getting rid of them completely, top surgery. I'm afraid of going through with reduction because I'm afraid my own community might not accept me or look down on me for not ""going all the way"". I'm afraid if I dont do complete top surgery that I'll never be accepted as myself by either the trans or cis  community. That no one will take me seriously. I'm afraid I'll regret getting rid of something that has been such a part of my identity in the past (even though it's been negative at parts).

---

I'm a transgender man. My partner is AFAB nonbinary and has been wrestling with their gender identity for years. I started transitioning around 5-6 years ago; throughout this time my partner has transitioned, detransitioned, then transitioned again, then detransitioned and so on, wrestling with whether they identify as a man, or a woman, or neither, or both. Hence wanting to post here in hopes that other people might have some experience and can help.

I'm borderline asexual. I enjoy sex because I enjoy intimacy with my partner, but sex is not necessarily something I *need*. It's not that I don't need intimacy, sex is just not the primary source for me. For me intimacy is spending quality time together, or holding my partner while we sleep, and bonding. This has always frustrated and hurt my partner. For them sex is definitely a need and the fact that I'm on the ace spectrum makes them feel like I don't find them attractive or that I judge them for needing sex, but this is far from the truth, they're the most attractive person I've ever met *to the point where I have never even wanted to have sex with anyone else* and of course I don't judge them for having a typical human need. They've also admitted it bothers them that I don't really care about gender, and that I dated a few guys in my past (even though they were all nonbinary and my only other serious relationship was with a woman). They don't like that I'm still attracted to them when they're presenting as male and admitted that they know that's homophobic. They also believe I'm *more* attracted to them when they're presenting male, but this isn't true, our relationship is just better when they're transitioning because they're much less depressed and that tends to coincide with more sex and bonding. I really don't have a preference either way. At the same time, to make matters more confusing it bothers them that I'm friends with women because they think I'm attracted to them. So they seem to think I'm a gay man BUT don't like that I have women friends. Their insecurity is really tricky to navigate. We went over this a couple of weeks ago again, and I told them I'm attracted to *them* and *them alone* and that I do not care what they look like, or how they present, or how they identify. It doesn't matter to me.

Our sex life is neither inactive or active. We go through periods where we will have sex every day, or every other day, but then we go through periods where we don't really do it more than once or twice a week for a couple of weeks. It tends to be when we're having trouble in our relationship, which I know isn't helpful and I have been trying to initiate more because I know it's a need for my partner (and of course I do enjoy it myself too even if it's not my main source of intimacy). This is important, bear with me.

A few days ago my partner told me that they wanted to transition again and were definitely going through with it because they're miserable as a woman and have been solidly identifying as a man for awhile. I supported this decision because they're *MUCH* more stable when they're transitioning and seem a hell of a lot happier, so I told them I'd get them an appointment at a gender clinic when we move so they can see a therapist. We had a pretty good day, but by the end of it we were fighting again (we have been fighting much more lately due to other stressors in our lives). They were lying next to me in bed, upset with me, and I knew it had been a couple of days since we'd had sex last and I was feeling horny so I initiated and we had a good time.

Last night they had a bit of an emotional meltdown and during this they flipped out on me for having sex with them on the day they said they wanted to transition. This threw me for a loop because that had nothing to do with why we had sex. Then they started snapping at me about how they would never have a man's body and never be attractive to me and so on (because I guess the fact that we had sex that day = confirmation that I'm gay???) and I just sat there stunned because I have no idea what the hell they're talking about. I love their body just the way it is. They KNOW I like their birth parts, which they also enjoy having. Then they said they want to stop having sex with me so at least they chose not to have sex, because we don't have it enough, and when I got upset about that because that makes no sense to me they just kept popping off on me. I brought up that I had desperately wanted to get a hotel just a couple of nights before that so we could have some time away from our roommates (who are causing us a lot of stress) and spend some quality time together having sex and bonding, and that THEY had been the one who didn't want to do that because they didn't feel like it, as proof that my initiation of sex had nothing to do with their gender at all, and they started attacking me on that for ""making them feel bad"" or whatever.

I'm so fucking lost. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to help my partner. I feel like I'm losing them. No matter what I do it doesn't seem to be enough to pull them out of this funk, and then I get frustrated and distant and things get worse. I feel like every day I wake up to a completely different person. Either they're feeling good and we have a great day or they're in some deep funk and it feels like they're hunting for something to be angry or upset over. To makes matters worse, I'm mentally ill (bipolar, medicated) so every day is already a struggle for me to maintain my waning stability, and when the shit hits the fan like this my suicidal ideation kicks in because I feel like a worthless pile of dirt who can't make my partner happy, and I have to keep us afloat while my own mind is trying to drown me.

We're going to therapy starting in May but I need help NOW before we continue to spiral.  I know I'm fucking everything up, I just don't know where to start.

So I have this friend who I sometimes fool around with. It started off with just foreplay, specifically me pleasuring her (something I enjoy even if I ""get nothing out of it""). However, the last time we hung out we decided to have penetrative sex. 
I am genderqueer AMAB and don't mind this type of sex most of the time, however as soon as we started she said something along the lines of ""your dick is amazing""... This was okay at first, but as we started to get going and she kept commenting about my penis I lost the moment... This isn't the first time I have lost an erection during sex so I knew how to keep thing enjoyable and she didn't mind that I switched to other types of sex until I got hard again.

For me the sex was just okay, but the way she talks about it you would think my penis was the best thing ever. Just today (3 months later) I got a message telling me she was thinking about my penis.

This brings me to my problem... How do I tell her that because of my gender identity and just personal preferences she is making me really uncomfortable by constantly telling me how ""amazing"" my penis is. I'm afraid that it could turn south if I don't say it just right.",genderqueer,Need help talking with a friend with benefits,1521303991.0,"{'created_utc': 1521278791, 'id': '852q61', 'num_comments': 4, 'score': 5, 'selftext': 'NSFW\n\nSo I have this friend who I sometimes fool around with.

I also still feel some connection to it and don't mind if family call me that as a sort of nickname. But again, it's very gendered and I want to be perceived as more neutral or andro in day to day life.

My work actually knows about my two partners, I brought them to my company Christmas party this last year. I'm not really worried about the last name part socially, I partially bring it up because it would be a reason to change my email address.

So I want to change my name to Skylar Sally-Jane Smith.

2018-03-26 01:51:52,875juc,1,3,"I had an experience tonight that raised some questions, and brought me here to see if there are answers. I'll talk about the experience further below.

A little background... 

I'm phenotypically male, 27, and heterosexual - although I can't say for sure that I wouldn't be flexible, as sometimes the thought of homosexual intimacy seems intriguing, and sometimes disgusting (in the literal, visceral reaction sense of the word, no negative connotations!).

I can remember ever since discovering my sexuality,  that I have from time to time been fascinated by what it would feel like to be female. The interest in what having boobs would feel like faded quite quickly, but I still occasionally think about how having female genitalia, being vaginally penetrated (though I've never much liked the thought of a penis in my ass), and having a full-body orgasm would feel.

Well tonight, lying still in bed, sexual imagery began to float through my mind, as it is wont to (a masturbating woman, if you must know), and I started becoming more and more aroused. As the imagery shifted to a woman being penetrated, I began to imagine how I would feel if I were being penetrated, and somehow, flexing my pelvic muscles in synchronisation with the mental thrusting rhythm tricked my brain into believing that I was really being fucked - in my vagina! It quickly became obvious that endorphins were being released, and pretty soon I had an incredibly intense, full-bodied experience, that I can only imagine must have been the elusive ""female"" orgasm - it was an intense tingling sensation throughout my body -  vastly more tingly than a male orgasm -  that pulsed for about two or three seconds, then had a short aftershock about 5 seconds later that was a bit less intense. It felt nothing like an ordinary male orgasm, and outshone even the strongest ones I have ever had. It came on very strongly and faded quite quickly, leaving a warm, endorphin afterglow. I didn't ejaculate - it felt as if this type of physical sensation was happening along an entirely different biochemical framework.

Well... Assuming what happened was at least somewhat like the female orgasm experience, I've come to believe that perhaps a Y chromosome doesn't have enough sway to prohibit what would typically be a female-only experience. It seems that these are in the realm of the experience of humans, not of males or of females. Experience is after all, just in the mind, and a high testosterone to estrogen ratio isn't apparently enough to lock this particular endogenous experience out. 

At the very least, I am happy to have discovered a new door to human experience that I'm keen to open again sometime. 

Now I would like to add, I do not have any gender dysphoria. I'm quite comfortable in my physical, social, and sexual gender expression as a biological male. I have never felt the need to hold onto any cultural, social, political, or sexual classification for my sense of identity - I am what I am and I am content with being so.

Nevertheless, I am interested to know if this kind of experience has a classification in non-binary/genderfluid/genderqueer terms. 

If you had to choose a label, do you know of any that might fit? Keeping in mind that identity and gender expression mean little to me - I'm just interested about ways to examine my internal world.

This whole journey began when I first watched Queer as Folk in 2014 upon graduating high school. My reaction to the show was jealousy and a want to be like those gay men. I didn’t understand why I specifically identified with the men and not the lesbians. Or really any lesbian. I started questioning whether I was transgender (ftm) until I did some research about found gender neutral cause I still like to wear girly clothes. That is until recently. 
I’ve recently begun finally accepting my gender difference and been completely out about it. But the more one I become open about my identity, going by Mick and not McKenzie, and using they pronouns, the more I dislike being a girl and the more being a guy becomes a more comfortable idea. I thought that if I came out as gender neutral I’d be more okay with either gender. Well that did not happen. 
Now I avoid girls clothes, dress more masculine, and wear binders more often. I’ve considered top surgery which is definitely happening, which is new because I used to be complacent about my chest. I never liked how big they were but now I just hate them. 
I feel like all of a sudden I’m so uncomfortable with every girly thing about myself. It’s just all so confusing. I don’t understand how I can be totally okay being a girl and then all of a sudden just really hate it. 
It’s hard to tell whether being a girl was ever really me because of the controlling environment i grew up in. I always had a gnawing sense that I wasn’t being myself and I just couldn’t understand it. I knew in childhood I used to have dreams of becoming a boy for a day, but at the same time would enjoy the color pink. 
Idk you guys. It’s all just a big mess right now and I have no freaking idea what my gender is right now.
I’m trying not to put a label on it, but at the same time I watch my partner transition, who is ftm, and it’s just been bringing all this old stuff up again. I thought I had settled who I was, but now I’m not so sure. 
It’s just difficult to tell what I want as far as transition if I can’t even get my gender right. 

So my big question for myself right now is: is my past suppressing the fact I’m transgender(ftm) or is it that I’m just both gender neutral and trans( in the neutral sense) and I’m finding the balance of those two confusing (ie transitioning but having a neutral gender) ?",genderqueer,I am so freaking confused!,1522116813.0,"{'created_utc': 1522091613, 'id': '87bsse', 'num_comments': 5, 'score': 2, 'selftext': 'So I technically identify as gender neutral, but the more I’ve been looking into my childhood struggles with gender and also my past traumas, the more I’m confused. \nThis whole journey began when I first watched Queer as Folk in 2014 upon graduating high school.

I knew in childhood I used to have dreams of becoming a boy for a day, but at the same time would enjoy the color pink. \nIdk you guys. It’s all just a big mess right now and I have no freaking idea what my gender is right now.\nI’m trying not to put a label on it, but at the same time I watch my partner transition, who is ftm, and it’s just been bringing all this old stuff up again. I thought I had settled who I was, but now I’m not so sure. \nIt’s just difficult to tell what I want as far as transition if I can’t even get my gender right. \n\nSo my big question for myself right now is: is my past suppressing the fact I’m transgender(ftm) or is it that I’m just both gender neutral and trans( in the neutral sense) and I’m finding the balance of those two confusing (ie transitioning but having a neutral gender) ?', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'I am so freaking confused!', 'created': 1522116813.0}"

2018-03-27 23:27:42,87n7dt,16,20,"Hey everyone. So I've been on T for almost 7 months now (I am AFAB). I can't believe the time has flown by that quickly. I identify as transmasc and non-binary and prefer they/them pronouns. Usually I describe myself as 60% neutral, 40% male. 

Recently, I'm pretty much consistently passing as male and am addressed by he/him pronouns automatically. When I first started passing, it was exciting even though I don't identify as male. Just being seen as something other than female that I identified with more was satisfying enough. However, now that people who I just meet in public/don't know me keep seeing me as male, it is making me uncomfortable. 

I would much prefer they/them pronouns, and I have a pin on my backpack that has the pronouns on it. I'm thinking about wearing the pin on my shirt more, but idk what else to do from here. It's hard to expect people to ask for pronouns instead of just assuming/using they/them for everyone until knowing them better. I know that won't happen. I just can't see myself correcting people constantly, especially people I don't know. 

On top of that, although I am happy with the changes I have gotten from T so far, I'm feeling iffy now that I'm 100% seen as male. I feel the need to express more femininity or look more queer or something, idk. I'm sure this is because I'm not being seen exactly as I want to be seen. I know going off of T would reverse some changes that I still want, but now I'm starting to consider at least lowering the dose a bit so things happen more slowly.

2018-03-28 20:46:42,87vf20,1,19,"Hi all,

As of late, I've been having so much dysphoria about my chest.  For the past 5 years or so I've been identifying as a butch lesbian and before that I was easily a feminine tomboy.  

I've finally made steps on acknowledging how I really feel, which is transmasculine.  I'm 27 and for a majority of my life, I grew up wishing I was a boy and eventually suppressed all those feelings and emotions as I became a teenager because I really thought it was something I would grow out of.  

When I met my girlfriend, I identified as a straight girl and didn't even think about having relationships with women.  This was in 2010 and over the past 8 years, I've watched myself grow and become more comfortable in being who I really am - a person who is transmasculine and genderqueer.

I've realized that I don't necessarily feel transgendered or have any interest in living my life as a man, but I'm also so detached from femininity that I don't really feel like a woman either. 

I have my first therapy session today with a therapist who specializes in gender identity with the ultimate goal of having top surgery.  I ordered my first binder from gc2b this past weekend and it should arrive on Friday.  

I set up a consultation with a surgeon in my area to discuss my options for moving forward with top surgery.  My insurance does cover a surgery as this and in the most ideal situation, I would be able to get a letter from my therapist to give to my surgeon so it would be covered.  I'm not sure about all of that yet but it's been great to make progress and stop hiding and censoring my feelings of my true identity.

I'm happy I've found this subreddit as I've been following a lot more nonbinary and transmasculine people and the support from everyone has been wonderful! 

If you have an instagram you don't mind sharing, drop your handle below!  I'm excited to start this journey and meet more people like myself.  You can find me at @sxvvy_

I feel an overwhelming feeling of what did I do. I can’t wear women’s clothes anymore without feeling right or just crying. I can’t look at my body or my face in the mirror.
