So, I'm FtM but more on the Genderqueer/Bigender end of the spectrum (specifically I identify as about 75% male), I just started T last week, and all of a sudden I'm having doubts.  In a weird way, I think that the T is making me more aware of my female side.

I don't really feel female, and while I do feel that ""male"" is a more correct label, I also don't feel fully male, either.  I decided to transition because I have a very ""female"" body that makes it almost impossible for me to pass without doing so, and I decided that my need to be seen as male outweighed my few feminine feelings.

Then, the other day, I stepped into the women's department at a store, for the first time in quite awhile.  I almost never wore women's clothes before I came out, but there were occasional exceptions when I saw something that was really my style.  Well, the other day I saw a top that was really my old style - a blue tank top overlaid with black lace.  Against my better judgement, I went to the dressing room and tried it on.

And for the first time in a long time, I saw a woman in the mirror and wasn't bothered by that.  In fact, I began to feel a little depressed at the thought of losing my ability to have ""girly days"" by transitioning.

I feel stuck.  If I continue to transition, I will eventually fail at ""girl mode"", especially since I am/was considering top surgery.  Even if I were to stop HRT, the frequent binding I do will eventually do major damage to my large (and fairly nicely shaped) breasts, making that female bit fairy unattractive.  However, if I don't continue transitioning, I will never be able to be seen as male, never be accepted into that side of society, and I'll be the laughing stock of my friends and family, whom I came out to quite some time ago.  If I stop HRT and stop binding, I won't be able to have ""guy days"", and ""girl mode"" will go back to being essentially my only option, denying the other 75% of my identity.  In a perfect world I could just switch bodies, but alas that technology doesn't exist yet.

I decided to transition because I felt that it was better to feel like myself 75% of the time than 25% of the time, and I still think those are better numbers, but how can I reconcile myself with the fact that I am eventually going to have to give up that female 25%?",genderqueer,"FTM, started transition but now having doubts.",1378091350.0,"{'created_utc': 1378066150, 'id': '1lj81z', 'num_comments': 26, 'score': 11, 'selftext': '(x-posted to genderqueer/asktransgender)\n\nSo, I\'m FtM but more on the Genderqueer/Bigender end of the spectrum (specifically I identify as about 75% male), I just started T last week, and all of a sudden I\'m having doubts.

2013-09-02 21:37:35,1llorp,14,20,"I posted last week that I was intending to reveal to the church I work at in my sermon last Sunday (9/1) that I am genderqueer and here is an update on how that went. I wasn't expecting the response to be negative overall, but I was absolutely staggered by how positive the response was. 

Our church has two services and after I finished my sermon for the first service I was a little worried that people were not going to respond very well because of how quiet and stare-y everybody was as I was walking back to my seat. However, during our prayer time somebody said they would like to have a prayer of thanksgiving for me and my courage and a lot of people clapped. Then as I was saying goodbye to people as they were leaving someone gave me a hug and while doing so this person gave me what might be the most meaningful compliment I have ever received on my speaking. Also somebody came up to me and told me they think I am just awesome : )

While I was preaching for the second service I noticed that someone might be tearing up, and when this person got out a handkerchief I thought to myself: “dammit, this is important” and I started to really try to drive home the message of the sermon. After I had finished this time I got a fucking standing ovation, which absolutely astounded me. During the prayer time for this service several people mentioned me, and one that stands out was a guy who appears more stereotypically masculine requested prayer for him being more understanding of people. After the service this person came up to me and said I showed more courage than he thought he could ever show and said if I ever needed anything at all to get a hold of him. As I was saying goodbye to people this time everybody was hugging me, and a friend that came commented that it looked like a receiving line at a wedding. One person, after saying something very moving, even offered to let me raid her closet. 

Like I said, this was absolutely astounding to me. I grew up in the midwest, and the religious climate there was such that I felt I had to hide who I really am. Sometimes as I've gone through my theological education and worked with churches and such I've wondered whether its really worth it for me to stay within the 'institutional' church and this was an experience that really helps convince me that there are cases where it definitely is. I think about the snide comments people make about me when I am out doing things or getting dinner with my spouse, and then I think about the response from the congregation yesterday and it gives me a great deal of hope.

So anyway, I got recorded at the second service, so if any of you are interested in hearing the sermon just let me know and I'll figure out some way to get it to you :)

2013-09-04 12:36:58,1lplhg,8,15,"So, I'm FAAB, but feel male most of the time; a guy who wants the world to see him for the guy he is. Except when I don't.  At those times, I feel like a guy who wants to sometimes be seen as a girl, or even sometimes I feel like a girl who wants to be seen as a girl.  But most of the time, I don't like being seen as a girl.  I'm really more bigender/genderfluid (or even agender, how I feel really varies), just with one side (male) much more prominent than the other, which is why I started HRT.

As I mentioned here recently, I started T a couple weeks ago, and I'm having conflicting feelings.  I had a great, long conversation with my partner last night, and it basically came down to him saying ""why don't you present the way you want to each day, use the pronouns you want to each day, and just say ""deal with it"" to everyone?""  My reply is that I don't want to be the laughingstock of my social group (who have already gone along with my coming out as trans) and that such a life isn't really all that compatible with most careers.  He said it sounds like I'm trying to have my cake and eat it to, and I agree, but that's how I feel, you know?  I find it really hard to give up one or the other.

I also have issues with the fact that if I go for ""both"", that's not an appearance I particularly like.  I don't want to be seen as a masculine woman when I'm feeling feminine, and I don't want to be seen as a butch lesbian or a teenage boy when I'm feeling masculine. I really want to be seen as either a man or a woman, but those two are kind of mutually exclusive.  Being able to switch on a daily basis kind of necessitates doing neither of them well.  I don't want hairy legs as a woman, but I don't want shaved legs as a man.  I don't want short hair as a woman, but I don't want long hair as a man.  I want a deeper voice as a man, but not as a woman.  Etc, etc.

I feel stuck between a rock and a hard place.  I do prefer to spend *most* of my life as male, just not all of it (though I didn't really realize this until I started T).  My partner (who is frustrated, but patient) has suggested that I go ahead with the changes necessary for me to pass better as male, and then just present however I want, but that's really hard, even though it's probably my best option.  If I do that, I feel like I'm going to make both an ugly man and an ugly woman.

2013-09-04 19:33:40,1lqfqj,10,24,"Hello everyone! I'm new this sub, and to Reddit in general, but it feels like this is the first place I've ever come across where I can share my story and not be met with puzzled looks - and maybe even talk with people who feel the same.

It will probably not be very interesting, but as the blurb on the right says here is a *safe* place and I've been craving for the opportunity to share my experience regarding gender. So here goes...


I was born a cisgendered girl that grew up as somewhat of a tomboy and remained unaware of gender expectations until puberty. Up till then my disinterest in all things feminine and obsession with books and school were met with amusement.

But after puberty hit, my peers became quite vocal about how I wasn't a *normal* girl. Girls don't play video games and read Plato. Girls wear bras, talk about boys, put on makeup, dress pretty and torture themselves with hot wax. I was puzzled because I just couldn't see the point in doing all those things. Bras are uncomfortable. Baggy clothes are more practical. Waxing hurts. Putting on makeup is boring.

I became widely known at school as ""the tranny"" and I was soon convinced there was something wrong with me.

So I looked up what ""tranny"" meant, but that didn't feel like me. Sure I didn't feel like a girl but I didn't feel like a boy either. I wouldn't mind having a penis but I like my vagina well enough. Either's fine. So that wasn't it. Was I a lesbian maybe? I tried kissing a couple of girls but try as I might, I was only into boys. I asked my mom if she had taken meds during her pregnancy, if she had had hormonal problems, anything that could explain why I wasn't *normal*.

After crossing off the list of things I *wasn't* but getting no closer to figuring out what I *was*, I just accepted the fact that I was somehow broken and that science might someday explain how and why. And I felt guilty, like I wasn't justified in feeling different and ostracized, because I was only *slightly* off, my abnormality a lack, vague, shapeless and nameless. So I didn't share my problems with anyone and tried my best to pretend and act and feel like a *woman*, feeling more guilty and ashamed every time I failed.

It wasn't until I reached about 25 that things suddenly clicked, in part thanks to my partner, a run-of-the-mill cisgendered male but who's been raised in the firm knowledge that gender and gender expectations are bullshit. It took me about a couple of years to understand what he meant by ""you're not a *woman* or  a *man*, you are a *person*.""

Along the way I met amazing people that challenged my preconceptions of gender and sexuality. I read blogs that made me more aware of LGBT concepts and issues. After a while I finally understood there was nothing wrong with me. One day I discovered the concept of *genderqueer* and the final piece of the puzzle was in place.

Lately, testosterone has been doing its thing (MAAB) and my face has been getting more masculine at a shocking pace. This time a year ago, during my first semester of college, my face looked pretty androgynous, and I'm surprised at how fast it's changing. Mostly, my cheekbones and the sides of my jaw are getting a lot more defined than I'd like. My hair as also getting a bit out of control. I don't really know what to do with it or how to take care of it. Currently my bangs are way too long, the back of my hair seems to be somewhat longer than the front, and it hasn't been layered in quite a while. It's about an inch or two past my shoulders so there's plenty of wiggle room for different styles and I figured now is the time to do something about it.

2013-09-07 02:46:38,1lw769,8,3,"So I've been questioning my gender for over a year now. All my life I've always wanted to be the opposite gender. I loved dressing up in girl's clothes and acting girly, but I also liked acting boyish. In fact, I've always been very self conscious about not acting masculine enough or being very manly because I would be teased a lot.

Well just over a year ago I realized that I don't belong to my gender. I was born male but didn't feel male. At least not all the time. Well I took this and learned a lot about gender. It was all really triggered when I had a conversation with Bunny, from SPG who I found out had gender dysphoria.

I did a lot of looking around and learning a bunch about gender and came to the conclusion that I was trans. Well I felt pretty darn good about myself when I realized that. I came out to a few close friends and went from there. 

Then later that summer I came out to my older sister while visiting her. (40somethings, I'm 18, turning 19 in November, was 17 at the time). She was very understanding and caring about it. Dang, I felt amazing! I just came out to a member of my family!

Now, here's where I break the joy. &gt;.&lt; My parents are extremely conservative. Very close minded (tolerant, but still close minded). They are both seniors and retired and very old fashioned (If you wonder the large age differences between my family and I, it's because I'm adopted). 
Growing up, I came to realize that telling my parents my own personal issues tended to cause negative effects and what I want to call guilt but guilt doesn't fit the feeling quite right. So from the start I knew that I absolutely could **not** involve my parents in any of this. 

Well anyway, I came out to my sister when the opportunity arose while we were messing around with costume jewelry. Shortly after I came out to her, my mother came into the room and joked about me wearing earrings and having my nails painted (my niece did that. Hot pink :3) and that I was acting like such a girl. 
To which my sister stated ""Well Mom, maybe there's actually something to that?""
Which sparked a big discussion with her about it, during which my father and brother-in-law came into the discussion about midway through. 
I ended up coming out to all my close relatives save for my brother who lives elsewhere. Reluctantly, might I add. 
My sister knew I didn't want to come out to my parents yet. And still mentioned it to my mother, which forced me to come out to her. 

I was **very** surprised at how well it went... I almost started crying near the end because it was going so well... My parents said they even had a feeling that I'd be interested in being a girl because they knew I've always been interested in girly stuff. I thought that things were going to be so much better from then on. 

Well that didn't last long. That night at the hotel, my father was out and my mother had a nice long talk with me about how selfish it was of me to tell my sister that because she already has a lot to worry about and now I'm just one more thing. And how much it's upset my father because he's always wanted to raise a son. And how it's a decision that will make my life drastically more difficult if I keep it up.
She guilted me into agreeing that I'm not really trans and that I'm a normal boy who's just trying on one of many hats before I find myself. 
Back in the closet. -_- Great..

Well I was about to start my senior year of high school. I went to a boarding school for the arts (I didn't board there, I drove each day) that was very liberal and wasn't at all unaccustomed to having LGBTQ students. In fact, they would help you to transition if you were trans. 
I was now out to most if not all of my friends I knew would understand, and then some. Anybody else would find out simply if they asked or if a situation arose where it would be easier to just tell them. And well, by second semester I said screw it, and was mostly completely out to my school. I even started wearing girl's clothes the last month or two to school (changed there, of course). 
The first time I wore them at school was very scary, but people were very understanding and some gave me tips. *Others even gave me clothing to help.* It was the most liberating feeling I've experienced yet. 

Over the summer, I did a lot of thinking and learning about myself and even more about gender. I had already known that I didn't like presenting male all the time, but I also didn't like presenting female all the time. So I decided that instead of saying that I'm transgender, that I'm just trans. And then found out that it's called gender fluid and adopted the new title. 

Now, I've started college and am going on my third week. I have connected with other trans and gender queer people here and learned that there are quite a few. I plan on joining student groups like GSA, PRIDE, and some others. And I'm trying to be open about my gender. Even trying to go by my desired name of Sam, which for some reason is remarkably difficult to break the habit of going by my legal name (Boy would I like some advice on that..). 
I really want to start wearing women's clothing occasionally at school or at least have some chest. 

*Side note: I'm rather okay with presenting female but still looking male. Like, wearing women's clothes but not doing much to pass. Hell, I can't do much about my face and my mother forces me to keep my hair short.*

So far, everything's going peachy. I just need to solidly come out to my parents again and I'll be minimally happy. 
Just... One thing has always bothered me about this. My mother has always said, that if I was gay (I'm actually bisexual-ish), that she would accept it completely and would support me. She would feel sorry for me, but would be 100% behind me. Yet she can't accept me not following the gender binary.. **sigh** 

I guess what I'm looking for now, is advice on how to come out to them.. How to be more open to others. How to go about using a different name. And I guess any advice on what to expect in the future or any advice going forward. 

**----------------TLDR----------------**

I'm AFAB and genderqueer, I've been on T for nearly 3 months. My gender has always been pretty static. 

I chose to go on HRT because I want to be able to pass more often as male. I hated being gendered as a girl constantly, I hated my voice, etc etc. Since I started HRT, my voice has dropped significantly. Now I know this is sort of a first world trans problem to have (literally and figuratively..).. but.. I don't know how to tell when to stop HRT.

Except for being gendered as a girl occasionally, I have not had much dysphoria lately. I feel a lot more comfortable in my body now, and I can tell I look and sound a lot more like a guy now. But I'm starting to realize that it's kind of difficult to gauge how much longer I want to be on T. Part of the problem is that I'll miss certain of the effects, such as increased energy and in general ""feeling"" more male (it's hard to explain). I also want to see some more changes in my face, muscle mass, and voice pitch, but I don't want other changes such as body and facial hair to continue.  I already had to start shaving my face because of a baby 'stache and little chin hairs, and my stomach is hairier than a lot of guys I know. So I'll be thinking of that, but then five minutes later I see a cis guy and want to look like him and then I feel like I want to be on T much much longer.

But it's also scary because I'm primarily attracted to queer women. By transitioning I'm limiting my dating pool because I don't know how many lesbians would want to date someone with this much body hair. I knew that would happen, and I have come to accept it, but it's still something I find myself worrying about. I guess I just don't know what I want, and I don't know who to talk to about it.

Since she's not into sharing, I am allowed to look for people online to chat with erotically as long as it doesn't go any further than that.\n\nSo I start on Second Life... Lots of trans-themed places, but oh so very clicky. It's like they don't notice you unless you spend every waking second there like they do. Then I try posting on /r/bdsmpersonals ... Not interested in talking to you if you're not gender-normative. Then I try Omegle... Holy CRAP are they rude there!\n\nSorry for the long-ish rant-ish post. Feel free to start some conversations on the comments if you have advise, a similar story to tell, etc. Thanks for listening."", 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Always on the fringe (slightly nsfw)', 'created': 1378636020.0}"

2013-09-11 00:04:35,1m52v1,7,3,"Hello!

As a non-native English speaker I always wondered how people who prefer to be referred to with gender neutral pronouns refer to themselves and/or want to be referred to in languages where grammatical gender is about more than personal pronouns only. I have on mind Romance and Slavic languages, but other may pose similar problems.

In case you aren't familiar with it, the gender plays role in the following:

* adjective forms must match gender of noun

* people's names and first/second person pronouns have the gender of the person they describe

* verb forms must match gender of subject (mostly in Slavic languages)

* declension of a noun depends on its gender (mostly in Slavic languages)

and so on. The third-person personal pronouns are simply implied by the grammatical gender.

For example, assume we have a person named Kim. Then, depending on the language and the gender:

|English|Spanish (M)| Spanish (F)|Polish (M)|Polish (F)|Polish (N)|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Kim is tall.|Kim es alt**o**.|Kim es alt**a**.|Kim jest wysok**i**.|Kim jest wysok**a**.|Kim jest wysok**ie**.|
|Kim sang.|Kim cantó.|Kim cantó.|Kim zaśpiewał.|Kim zaśpiewał**a**.|Kim zaśpiewał**o**.|
|An article about the famous Kim.|Un artículo sobre Kim famos**o**.|Un artículo sobre Kim famos**a**.|Artykuł o sławn**ym** Kim**ie**.|Artukuł o sławn**ej** Kim.|Artykuł o sławn**ym** Kim.|
|""I was at home.""|""Yo estaba en casa.""|""Yo estaba en casa.""|""Był**em** w domu.""|""Był**am** w domu.""|""Był**om**[?] w domu.""|
|(3rd-person pronoun)|él|ella|on|ona|ono|

(Note that the neuter gender in Polish is virtually never used in first and second person or to refer to a named person, just like *it* in English. The rightmost column will probably not be understood by others due to confusing use of the neuter gender. It was included for completeness.)

So here comes my question: if you were using a language that uses gender more prominently than English and wanted to refer to someone specific (including yourself) in a gender-neutral way, how would you do it?

2013-09-14 07:47:04,1md7td,26,12,"Okay, so. A bit of backstory: 
I'm FAAB, 22 yo, and have had a strong drive to be androgynous since an early age, I love men's clothes, especially formal wear and I love the feel it gives me to wear them, I've always played around with that and it's who I am.

From age thirteen to nineteen I've self harmed and been in a bad place over all, it all reflected badly on my image and I'd just put on the first thing I'd find in the morning, my hair were cropped almost military short. Basically there was nothing beautiful or just right about the way I treated myself. I'd even binge eat and throw up or right out starve myself for weeks. The only things I kept a good distance away were substances of any kind (luckily). 

At eighteen my parents found out (actually I told them, so you can imagine how much attention they were paying to my life) and I've started seeing a therapist. The first two years were hell and we went as a family, but it served the purpose and things got really better, then I started seeing him on my own and things kept getting better even though I still struggle with my studies. Over all though I've got a better comprehension of myself and I take care of my body and mind. 

In the years it took to get my equilibrium back I've focused on my female appearance because it was easier since I have a pretty feminine body, but now that things are good I've gone back to switching back and forth between feeling a man and a woman and sometimes just in between but it's nothing like my teen years, I've got a versatile haircut that I can decide how to style depending on how I feel that morning, I've got nice clothes and I spend time on them, I'm losing some weight and so on. Basically, if I follow my instinct and wear and act accordingly I'll have a great day. 

Also, I'm bi, I have a boyfriend of three and a half years who loves me and knows everything about me since we've known each other for eight years. Our relationship is in a happy place and I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world.

Now, this happened yesterday but I wanted to talk about it with him for weeks, I was wary because I had always felt some resistance on his part every time I mentioned being bisexual: 

Me: I want to explore my androgynous side, I feel comfortable in men's clothes and it's nothing to do with what happened in my teens.
Therapist: Well, you surely have a strong male side and to ask yourself how comfortable you are in your body and how much you want to be a woman is good, but you can't wear men's clothes like this. It's an exploration and if you end up deciding that you want to act like that you'll have to become lesbian and find a woman that will let you be the man. Or you might indeed be bisexual (which it might stay for genderfluid as well because my mother tongue doesn't have anything like that term) and you'll have to decide which side you want to let predominate and so on. 

And I was just like: NO. I'm not a lesbian, I'm not a butch, that's not who I am. I know it. But I'm not even just a woman.  

But it was obvious that he wasn't going to listen and then it just got worse:

Therapist: Even in your relationship you're the man and your boyfriend is much more feminine than you, he had long hair and he's quiet and delicate even in features.

I didn't even know what to say to that! My boyfriend is my man, he makes me feel sexy and wanted and I'm a woman with him most of the time, he's big spoon and takes care of me. He knows he has a feminine part, but he's comfortable in his identity as a man. Just because he's quiet and sort of shy it doesn't mean he's less of a man.

And then the final blow:

Therapist: You might discover your bisexuality (this time in its English meaning).

Me: But I am bisexual. I know that already.

Therapist: Being bisexual is not having some fantasy about a girl friend.

Me: I know. But I'm bisexual.

Therapist: No, you don't know that.

Luckily by then the session was over and we promised we'd talk about it again and I left.

Fuck. I'm so angry and upset. He's an awesome guy and he's been very good at his job up until now, but I don't know if this is something I can overlook. I'm not opposed to the idea of questioning and exploring my sexuality, but his boxes are definitely too tight for me and I don't want to fit there. And it destroys me the fact that he wouldn't even listen. Fuck you. That's your job! I don't know. I think he can't see past what I did to my body once (he actually said that wearing those clothes now would be just a symptom like cutting myself and nothing positive.). 

**TL;DR** My therapist has negated me every saying in what my gender identity and sexual orientation are based on the fact that I've struggled with my body image in the past. He said I have to choose at some point if I'm a man or a woman and if I decide to keep my androgyny I'll have to become lesbian and find a woman that will ""let me do the man"".

A bit of backstory: \nI\'m FAAB, 22 yo, and have had a strong drive to be androgynous since an early age, I love men\'s clothes, especially formal wear and I love the feel it gives me to wear them, I\'ve always played around with that and it\'s who I am.\n\nFrom age thirteen to nineteen I\'ve self harmed and been in a bad place over all, it all reflected badly on my image and I\'d just put on the first thing I\'d find in the morning, my hair were cropped almost military short. Basically there was nothing beautiful or just right about the way I treated myself. I\'d even binge eat and throw up or right out starve myself for weeks. The only things I kept a good distance away were substances of any kind (luckily). \n\nAt eighteen my parents found out (actually I told them, so you can imagine how much attention they were paying to my life) and I\'ve started seeing a therapist. The first two years were hell and we went as a family, but it served the purpose and things got really better, then I started seeing him on my own and things kept getting better even though I still struggle with my studies. Over all though I\'ve got a better comprehension of myself and I take care of my body and mind. \n\nIn the years it took to get my equilibrium back I\'ve focused on my female appearance because it was easier since I have a pretty feminine body, but now that things are good I\'ve gone back to switching back and forth between feeling a man and a woman and sometimes just in between but it\'s nothing like my teen years, I\'ve got a versatile haircut that I can decide how to style depending on how I feel that morning, I\'ve got nice clothes and I spend time on them, I\'m losing some weight and so on. Basically, if I follow my instinct and wear and act accordingly I\'ll have a great day. \n\nAlso, I\'m bi, I have a boyfriend of three and a half years who loves me and knows everything about me since we\'ve known each other for eight years. Our relationship is in a happy place and I wouldn\'t trade it for anything in the world.\n\nNow, this happened yesterday but I wanted to talk about it with him for weeks, I was wary because I had always felt some resistance on his part every time I mentioned being bisexual: \n\nMe: I want to explore my androgynous side, I feel comfortable in men\'s clothes and it\'s nothing to do with what happened in my teens.\nTherapist: Well, you surely have a strong male side and to ask yourself how comfortable you are in your body and how much you want to be a woman is good, but you can\'t wear men\'s clothes like this. It\'s an exploration and if you end up deciding that you want to act like that you\'ll have to become lesbian and find a woman that will let you be the man. Or you might indeed be bisexual (which it might stay for genderfluid as well because my mother tongue doesn\'t have anything like that term) and you\'ll have to decide which side you want to let predominate and so on. \n\nAnd I was just like: NO. I\'m not a lesbian, I\'m not a butch, that\'s not who I am. I know it. But I\'m not even just a woman.  \n\nBut it was obvious that he wasn\'t going to listen and then it just got worse:\n\nTherapist: Even in your relationship you\'re the man and your boyfriend is much more feminine than you, he had long hair and he\'s quiet and delicate even in features.\n\nI didn\'t even know what to say to that!

I was wondering if anyone out there had some good suggestions on what to wear to a formal event/wedding that wouldn't be too masculine or too feminine. I definitely do not want to wear any form of dress/skirt, and would prefere it being on the more masculine side, but I can't go ""all out"" with men's clothing.

Edit: Thank you for all your help! I thought I'd add some details to maybe help with suggestions a bit:
I'm biologically female, but very, very broad shouldered, so most female clothing doesn't fit right ( or feel right) on my anyways.

I saw him again yesterday and after talking a bit about my uni exams (which are going great after a year that I was really stuck, so yay me :D) he asked if there was something I wanted to talk about given that we didn't have to focus on school so much anymore.

It took me a bit of courage but I managed to explain to him that I hadn't felt understood at all and that I felt judged in a wrong way (he very rightly says we always judge, the difference is in the effort to understand). He had me explain what I meant and I told him that I have always truly felt a strong dynamism in my identity when it came to the coexistence of my male and female side and how one could prevail on the other every so often.

He said that's okay and completely normal, that I can act on it as much as I want as long as I keep in my consciousness which side I'm letting prevail at that moment. Meaning that if I need to act more on my male side to feel more secure that's okay, but I have to know the reasons and not use it as a mean to dissociate from my body or worse from my interpersonal relationships. Basically it's fine as long as I don't use it as a ""stunt"" to keep my emotions or the people I love away and instead make it a true part of my identity that I understand and know how to use.

And I totally agree with that, I mean, who wouldn't? 

In the end he apologized and explained that basically he was scared for me because he's had a very long career and he's met people who claimed to be homosexuals or transgender that after a period of therapy found out it wasn't the case but it was an escape route from other problems and with my past that could very well be the case for me too.

So, our therapeutic relationship has come out stronger than ever and I feel safe with him again and most of all comfortable in my body! Yay for happy endings.

2013-09-23 01:05:49,1mxgpn,27,10,"This is my first time talking about this and I'm not really sure where to  begin. I think I've gotten as far as I can on my own as far as accepting myself, so I'm looking for some help to continue. Whether that is here or with a group or a therapist, I don't know.


As far as background, I'm 26 and I guess the term is female assigned at birth. Similar to others' experiences I've read, I was a tomboy growing up; I loved video games, bugs, catching lizards etc. Beyond that, I wanted short hair and feared puberty because I didn't want breasts. I remember once being mistaken for a boy and thinking to myself that it was a compliment. It happened another time, but by a teacher in front of my peers, and it was very embarrassing.


In middle school/high school, my main pursuit became fitting in and having a few good friends, and I did that to a T. I also developed really strong crushes on a few guys my age (one of whom came out later as gay, which is relevant) and even some male teachers (also relevant). The little boy I wanted to be as a kid was well-buried under a fairly average adolescent girl's persona. 


Since I never did have a boyfriend or the sexual experience I wanted during high school, right when I went to college at 18, finding a boyfriend and having sex became my main interest. So I did. I've had 3 relationships between then and now, with the longest and current being 5 years. In that whole span from 18 to 26, the total amount of time I've spent single is no more than 2 months, probably less.


This brings me to my current conundrum. Since I've spent so much time as part of a couple, I haven't really allowed myself to examine my full sexuality. I have done so a lot in my own head, but I have never fully expressed it, and now I don't know how. 


As I mentioned, I had crushes on teachers/older men, so my current boyfriend is 15 years older than me, which satisfies some of my interest. Early on, the sex was great and very hot, but now 5 years later..it's not. Actually it's non-existent. He is very understanding, maybe too understanding, that it ""just happens"" if you're in a relationship for a long time. He never pressures me and I tell him I feel bad, which I do. I think I'm content with this for now because I'm not being pressured to explain myself.


Where I'm at now: I'm very sure that my persona, how I ""present"" to the world, is female, and I'm sure I want to keep it that way. I have a successful career, I *think* I want kids, and I will probably marry my boyfriend. I like having long hair, I like my clothes, I like my body. 


Why I'm here is that wanting to be a boy as a kid, has morphed into a sexual interest in essentially all things penis. I think sexuality-wise, I am a gay male. A number of my friends are gay men (though I've never discussed any of this with them). I prefer gay male porn and in a sexual setting, I wish I had a penis. These feelings and issues are so deep I don't see how I'll ever be able to talk about this with my boyfriend without fundamentally changing how he sees me. I've minimized these things in my own mind, to the point of cutting out sex completely, or nearly completely, and making it a small part of our relationship. Otherwise, we have a fantastic relationship and are best friends.


I guess my bottom line issue is that I'm concerned about committing to someone about things as serious as marriage and children without ever discussing this with anyone. 


Finally, I think part why I've been so loathe to ever bring any of this up, is my personal assumption/speculation, that my dad may be gay. While my parents get along great, I've never seen them be intimate at all. No hand-holding, no kissing other than a peck, occasional hugs. For the record, there are many other reasons I think this, in addition to these physical things, but it's not relevant at this point. My mom seems oblivious or in denial. So keeping these deeply personal things a huge secret, seems normal to me.


What are your thoughts? Does anyone have a similar experience? Do you have any suggestions?

I'm FAAB, genderqueer, with an increasingly masculine internal identity. I've decided I want to start experimenting with a more masculine presentation.

I have had long hair my entire life. I had it cut short once when I was 5 or so and absolutely hated it. I really like [this masculine cut](http://www.hairfinder.com/haircollections6/wint3.jpg).

I was all ready to make my appointment today but now I'm getting cold feet! 

I have 2 concerns: 

1. If I tie my hair up right now, I can live with it. It's not what I want, but at least I can't feel my long hair any more (sick of that). So I'm afraid I won't like the new look but won't have any alternatives.

2. I'm afraid of getting ""the look"" in public. I know if I cut my hair short people are going to start playing the, ""Guess their gender"" game, and I'm not sure if I'm ready.  I'm also looking for work and am afraid if I start messing with gender presentation I'll have trouble finding a job (Midwest US).

I'm pretty sure I'm just being afraid for no good reason and would like you to help me get the courage to move forward with my life!

**TL;DR**
So, would anyone like to share their short hair experiences?

**Edit:** Made an appointment for tomorrow afternoon. :) Ty all!

I see that she gets dysphoric and it sucks, because I don't know how to help her. I call her gender neutral or masculine things when it's appropriate, but that's not enough you know. She feels like she could never achieve what she wants because she's got a naturally pretty feminine body and her profession means she will always have to have long hair and stuff. But I know that's not true, I've managed to get her to the point wear she passes to try and prove this to her, but she still doesn't believe me. I've got her to try binding her chest but she says it makes her feel more self conscious because it makes her think about gender and she feels self conscious about looking like a girl with a flat chest. The thing is, although I definitely see her being in tune with her femininity, she's definitely more towards the male side, maybe even ftm. I see her as a feminine guy or just without gender really, definitely not female, but female is what she has to live as.
