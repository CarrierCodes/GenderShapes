2013-01-02 14:52:52,15tsg1,13,6,"In the past, I've always felt most comfortable with short hair, baggy T-shirts, boxer briefs, no makeup, and loose jeans.
Recently, I've stopped cutting my hair short due to a sudden desire to grow out my hair, and even got some cute bangs a week ago (mostly to get my hair out of my face). I've switched from light binding and exercise bras to basic underwire ""regular"" bras, as well as to more form-fitting clothing. I'm also wearing basic makeup almost daily, which is sort of new and daunting to me. Nobody at school or home seems to care or react much, although I've been getting more people saying ""you look nice/pretty today!"", which I honestly have no idea how to react to other than a quick thanks and an uncomfortable smile.

I'm not sure *why* exactly I've felt inclined to present myself this way, maybe I'm just testing the waters to see if I'm my comfort level with this is different from a few years ago. I really like how long hair looks, possibly because I've had trichotillomania for forever and that was never an option to try out before. I haven't shaved my legs and underarms in months, and so dresses and skirts come with tights and sleeves. I'm not comfortable with my legs or pits shaved, but I'm also not confident enough to have two ""clashing"" aspects of my gender identity expressed together in public (*someday, fuzzy legs and a summer dress!*). I honestly wish I could shapeshift my body whenever I felt a special inclination to whatever part of me I wanted to express the most on the outside. I could have shoulder length hair and lovely curves one day, and then the next just cut it all off and have a flat chest and be five inches taller. Alas, that isn't how it works.

Granted, it's just my expression that's changed, my behavior and personality is unchanged. I just needed to get some musings off of my shoulders, so thanks for reading :)

**QUESTION** Have you ever felt this way? Have you had sudden changes in what you wanted to express or try out?

2013-01-03 02:03:38,15v1os,6,6,"I am in need of some candid advice. This will likely go beyond the borders of gender identity, and I hope I can get pointed in some good directions. It’s taken many hours of thought and months of considering before I made this post. If I use incorrect terminology, I apologize and will correct it ASAP. I know it’s way too long, but I need to get this all out and have someone – anyone – read it without major judging.

I am MAAB in my mid-twenties. I have an invisible physical disability that affects my motor control on my right side. It limits me in certain ways, but I have to tell most people its there. Since I can remember, I’ve struggled with personal identity, but it’s gotten worse in recent months. I know what my hobbies are. I know what my skills are, and I know what my personality is like. Everything else is negotiable. 

I have a disconnect with my body. I’m not sure what term can describe it. I have trouble recognizing or reconciling myself in images and videos of me. When I go to the bathroom mirror, I have no idea what to expect. When I look, it takes a half second or second for my brain to go ‘that’s me!’ regardless of what I see. It even unnerves me some to see that it moves as I move. I sometimes can look at a photo for ten seconds before I notice that I’m in the foreground. Since I was six or seven, I’ve thought about why I can’t just change my shape with just a snap of my fingers. The only times that I feel less awkward in that sense is when I have some sort of face covering: mostly masks and helmets.

I don’t like the feeling of being limited in the physical aspect of who I am. I don’t get tattoos for that reason. While I enjoy seeing them on others, the idea of permanency with my body scares me. To be clear, I don’t hate my body. I don’t shy away from photos. I can look great in photos and in the mirror, and still feel that alienation.

I’m a costumer/cosplayer.  I’m part of a charity group that raises money or helps others through costuming, on top of many other reasons. I’ve been on local news seven times in the past year, including recycled stories, and a few times in the papers. Becoming someone else is old hat to me. I mentioned helmets and masks before: when I can’t recognize my usual self in the mirror or photos, I’m happier.

The onset of actual self-exploration came rather late to me – I was so busy with high school and university, I pushed everything about me aside for the things I needed to get done. It’s only been in the eighteen months since I graduated that I’ve really started asking myself who I am. Being called a man feels all the way wrong and woman was worse. I’ve often thought of my genitalia so distantly that I think of it like soft clay. If I were to shove with the heel of my palm, it would just smooth out and I wouldn’t care.

One thing that kind of shocked me (and I’m still getting over) is that I’m probably asexual. The absence of any sexual desire at all meant that I had no ‘what I want’ axis to counterpoint the ‘who I am’ in some sort of human graph. Made it harder to steer, as it were. That’s largely a topic I’ll discuss in the asexuality subreddit.

About eight months ago I was introduced to the concept of genderqueer and fluid identity. At the time, I largely overlooked it as something I should think about. I thought I understood it as wanting to sit on the fence of the gender spectrum. I was somewhat wrong, we can all agree.

I should have taken to the signals of having no expectation for my body. Three months ago (which gives you an idea of how long I’ve been lurking) I came across [this thread]( http://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/108alt/gender_roles_vs_gender_identity/) and the commenters (Ray in particular) made something resonate so loudly I could swear that I heard a tuning fork. I’ve done a great deal of pondering since then.

A little list of events that have poked at me about all this in the past couple years:


* In early 2011, a scheduling mishap caused me to grow my hair longer than two inches for the first time in my life. It ended up growing for six months. I was in a break room at work and was talking to a friend when I mentioned I was probably going to get my hair cut soon. Three female coworkers of an age with me, not even in the conversation all blurted ‘No!’ I was thrown for a loop. They all went on to say that long hair looked much better on me. I have ended up keeping it longer than average since then, to the chagrin of relatives. At its longest, the back and back/sides could touch the collar of a t-shirt.

* I’m happier in the mirror with long hair, the halo of it felt like a mane of courage. I oddly especially like it when its messy, though not dirty.

* While having long hair, I’ve had several people mistake me for female from behind during coat-wearing months. I wasn’t offended, I was pleased. Was unsure why.

* Being underemployed, I got a security license to do more work where I could. However, most security companies had the stipulation that men must have really short hair for safety reasons and to ‘look professional.’ Women can have long hair, though, as long as it’s tied back. I seriously questioned the logic in the distinction.

* I got my hair cut by a new person this fall, and showed her several photos of the previous six months. I was told that if these are dated accurately, my hair growth is almost twice as fast as others. When she cut it to security-job standards, I realized that it looked more feminine to me than my long hair. Seriously questioned myself on why it mattered.

* More and more, I see female-intended clothing and realize I could probably ‘rock that look pretty hard’

* I live in a very LGBT friendly city. One local geek hangout I like had two ladies’ nights that appealed to me, and included the fact that they are both accepting female-identified and genderqueer individuals. Seriously considered going, but some female friends would be at either event and I was so not ready for anything like that.

* For Christmas 2012, this past week, I had asked for a mannequin for my costumes. My brother gave me a headless female one for Christmas, perfectly wrapped so that none of it was showing but the paper was a second skin. My family got a kick out of it, and brought it to the dinner table for Christmas dinner and put it next to me, calling it by the female version of my name. You have no idea how strange it felt, considering they are rather conservative.

A bit of my verdict from these events and thought: I don’t think I have a gender identity. I don’t really have an urge to strive for androgyny, though the idea of gender expression is still an important issue. And it worries me from lack of confidence. In an ideal world, my gender expression would be no different than picking what sweater I want today. It would change every day. Very feminine or masculine, depending on my mood, like it were a red or blue shirt. 

Being a costumer/improvisation person, becoming other people is second nature to me. Different postures, stances, voices, you name it. But we all know costumes and cosplay isn’t real. I know they aren’t. The problem with experimenting with gender expression in the everyday for me is that as a (possible?) agender, is that it’s ‘fake’ – even to me. My current expression, as close as it is to my birth gender already, still feels like it’s put on. I think I lack the confidence to present the way I want because I don’t see it as being ‘me’, just ‘me today.’ 

I don’t want others to see this gender apathy as me playing games, nor as something that has to be super-serious all the time. I have the normal anxieties about what friends (who are largely LGBTQ friendly!), family, and employers would think about me, but I definitely don’t want others to think I’m a fraud for wanting to do whatever I feel like – even if it’s nothing out of the ordinary and call myself genderqueer. My family would definitely be the biggest hurdle, of course.

There are several LGBTQ locations (and a gay village) in my city, and several of them host genderqueer/trans evenings. I’ve been considering going, but my lack of commitment or divergent expression thus far would push me to the outside. I also feel that the moment I make any move about anything, all eyes are going to be on me and even if I cut things off it could all come back to bite me. I’m financially vulnerable and a misstep could hurt me hard.

EDIT: Just wanted to add, I live with two roommates, not my family. My roommates have no clue, either.

Does anyone have advice for this rambler? I have no idea how to proceed. ‘Coming out’ – if that’s what I should call it – would be hard even to my LGBTQ friends. Just pressing this submit button is a huge deal for me.

PS: If you think you know me personally after this exhaustive description, shoot me a PM to confirm or deny. I could use a confidential friend to talk to in my city.

2013-01-03 17:21:24,15wa0f,3,9,"I apologize in advance if this post gets too long. 

I am 21, MAAB, and have mainly identified as a gay male since around age 16. For the last several years I have been questioning that identity. I have had general feelings of gender dysphoria through the years but have never felt like I could identify as female. However, I have become more and more uncomfortable with a strictly male identity, and have gone back and forth about it a lot. Last year I took a more gender neutral name with my friends and was open to them about being genderqueer. Having an awesome and diverse social circle, they were more than supportive. However, after 6 months or so I reverted back to my birth name, partially because of criticism from various family's members (who don't know anything about my gender identity, but had heard about the name change and expressed their dislike of it). The other reason was that I was starting to feel more secure about a male identity (though I qualified it by adding ""gender variant"" in front of it) and thought I could be okay with it again. 

Things don't magically work like that though. I've been through a lot lately, including getting medication for previously untreated bipolar disorder and anxiety. My general confidence and happiness has greatly improved. But my confusion and discontent about this continues. I'm afraid that if I keep going forward in my life without addressing this I will eventually crack. The thing is... I don't know how to actively embrace or act on my feelings. I like typical male fashion most of the time, and while I like wearing somewhat androgynous clothing at times and like wearing a certain amount of makeup when going out, it's nothing that people don't just attribute to me being gay. I dont want to change how I dress just to conform to social ideas of ""feminine"", and I guess its more of a body thing for me. I'm fairly tall and deep voiced, both if which I dislike, and more than that I simply don't have a feminine body type at all. I struggle a lot with my body image, and while I would never get gender reassignment survey (I'm happy with what is between my legs) I sometimes have such strong body dysphoria I feel suicidal. Though my parents are very accepting of my presented orientation, they seem much more ambivalent about when it comes to atypical gender presentation/identity, and I feel like they are both strongly attached to my male identity (especially my mother) whether I am gay or not. I am scared shitless when it comes to talking about these things with them.

So there's the long word dump I apologized for, and now I'll ask a few questions... Firstly, is it possible to get hormone therapy if you don't have a binary gender identity and don't want to fully transition to the opposite gender? Does anyone have any experiences or thoughts about this? Second, does anyone have any advice on how to embrace/express a more androgynous identity besides changing how I dress? Third, how can I address this when it comes to relationships?  I am afraid of getting into relationships because I don't want someone to fall for for me only identifying me as male. I want them to understand and accept my non-binary identity and feel attracted to it - I don't want to just have a gay boyfriend who sees me as an effeminate male. Am I over-thinking that, or am I justified feeling like it really matters? 

Any and all feedback, advice, support, or sharing would be wonderfully appreciated.",genderqueer,Struggling and lost - advice on expression and relationships please?

If I were being honest (and I promise I was) I would say that these results are accurate. But then I’m sitting here thinking about it and I find myself questioning my own answers. Are these results true to me as I present in society and therefore only partially accurate or did I subconsciously answer the questions as I feel I truly am? In which case, are my recent thoughts and feelings about my gender identity irrelevant? I don’t want to believe that but I can only draw that conclusion now. I can’t imagine that all of this confusion within my thoughts about me and my thoughts about society are just fabricated to give myself this ideal that there is a reason I’ve never accepted myself as the stereotypical female citizen I’ve always craved I would someday conform to. I refuse to accept that in my own personal rebellion I’ve clung to this idea that it wasn’t me that there was something wrong with, it was societies opinions. And now I’m just confusing myself even further. I just wanted some shred of hope to cling to in all of my confusion that in my own bubble of knowledge I firmly believed that I was okay and they were the ones who were fucked up but I’m not sure anymore. I’m not sure about anything.

Edit:
I really appreciate everyone opinions and thoughts about my problem and I agree that this shouldn't be taken seriously. I just had a shit night where I was questioning everything. I am slowly working toward defining myself before I let something else define me. Thanks a lot for all your input!!

It's a huge change. I think it will take getting some used to (didn't realize how much I used to hide behind my hair!) But the hair dresser was just so lovely and knew exactly what I was looking for. I've spent my whole life hiding my face, because I felt like my feminine features didn't fit on my angular bone structure, or some shit like that. But now it's like... hello face. I can see you as a whole instead of a bunch of parts that don't fit together. I'm still a little lost on styling and good outfits but I have almost two weeks before school starts.

Struggling a little bit with seasonal depression/social isolation (roommates are still gone) and sometimes when I'm walking around fretting/feeling poop, the hair seems really jarring. But the hair is off, and I can either hide or I can walk outside with my head held high and smile when I can.

I've been trying some guided imagery when I feel really lost, like some picture of how I want to look. I'm trying to picture myself looking confident and handsome. What that would look like. I've also been doodling in the same vein, which is funny, because in younger life that was the only place I felt comfortable expressing a more androgynous self. 

This is scary! But also very, very exciting. And tumultuous. And it's bringing up a lot of really intense feelings, some of them that have been  locked away for a long time. I've been goofing around on the internet too much the last few days so I think after I post this I'm going to go try to get some things done and not dwell.

I'm still a little lost on styling and good outfits but I have almost two weeks before school starts.\n\nStruggling a little bit with seasonal depression/social isolation (roommates are still gone) and sometimes when I'm walking around fretting/feeling poop, the hair seems really jarring. But the hair is off, and I can either hide or I can walk outside with my head held high and smile when I can.\n\nI've been trying some guided imagery when I feel really lost, like some picture of how I want to look. I'm trying to picture myself looking confident and handsome. What that would look like. I've also been doodling in the same vein, which is funny, because in younger life that was the only place I felt comfortable expressing a more androgynous self. \n\nThis is scary! But also very, very exciting. And tumultuous. And it's bringing up a lot of really intense feelings, some of them that have been  locked away for a long time. I've been goofing around on the internet too much the last few days so I think after I post this I'm going to go try to get some things done and not dwell.\n\n"", 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'I hear you guys like before/after photos... update from yesterday', 'created': 1357952106.0}"

So, I don't really know what I'm looking for here. Maybe just a vent.


Basically my issue is that while I've recently started identifying as genderqueer after a lifetime of not knowing there was a label for my weirdness. BUT- I am also ""blessed"" by my birth body, which I realistically admit is a gorgeous example of the tall, lean feminine figure. To boot, it naturally sits at a ""perfect"" weight of slender-with-curves, regardless of what I eat or do. Women every day ask me if they can borrow my figure and metabolism please.


I have a lovely body. It's extremely aesthetically appealing and were I not in it I'd find it very attractive. But it's not MY body, and it doesn't reflect the way I feel or think 95% of the time. I don't really want it and to be frank I don't like being in it much at all.


I'm carrying a lot of guilt about not wanting a body I know I'm privileged to have. Anyone got ideas for how I can either come to terms with or move past this? I also don't know what I DO want my body to look like, since every time I try to think about it I get caught in the mindfuck that is what society tells those of us who are FAAB that we should want to look like. How do I explore what I want to present as without saying a grand ""fuck you"" to women who sweat and bleed to look more like I already do?

Unfortunately, I can't find work so when my last contract was over I moved back in with my parents. I'm in my late twenties.

As part of my transition, I've let my brows grow in and have taken to shaving my facial hair. My mother will not let the eyebrow thing go. She insists on taking me to the nail salon to get them waxed. I've tried telling her that I don't want to go. When she asks why not, I don't have an answer for her because I'm not ready to come out to her yet. Every few days, she whines about my eyebrows. I've tried deflecting her, but it always starts up again. 

Lately, she's kicked it up a notch by begging my femme friends to pluck them for me whenever they come over. This really makes my friends very uncomfortable since they are fully supportive of me. She also will order me to put my jacket on when she comes home to go get them done, as if I am a child. When I refuse, she asks why I'm being difficult 'like a teenager.'

I like girls and boys but I can only really see myself with a female, but I think that may just be how I was raised(my father asked me every single day of high school, ""do you have a girlfriend yet?"" to which my answer was always no. 

I have dated and had sex but that does not satisfy me, although I am a very romantic being. I even set up many dates for friends, cooking them dinner and planning everything out, wishing I could experience somebody doing that for me, but romantic evenings are almost always the boys' job. 

I am just so frustrated, it's not like I want a sex change, I don't, it would not solve anything, I just do not like being a male. 

Even worse, I have told a few friends and they do not seem to care, it changes nothing, I am treated the same way. I even go by Diana to a few friends instead of my given name, along with moving and talking in a feminine manner, but that only leaves me feeling like I am lying. 

What do I do? How do I analyze this? How do I figure out who I am enough to be myself?

I want to be pretty. Now, coming from a male that is 190 lbs, 5'10"", and built like a fucking viking, a statement like that might seem a bit odd, or silly. But it's how I feel: I want to be pretty, I want to *feel* pretty. Let me explain. 

Firstly, I am somebody who is masculine for the most part, I like sports and guns, I listen to and make loud and obnoxius music, etc. I am a stereotypical male in many respects. But I am also not stereotypical in other respects. So I wouldn't necessarily want to betray a side of me that is very real by dressing/behaving/generally being something other than that.

However, I have no desire to act like a female either. I don't want to drag. I don't really want to wear makeup (though my understanding of cosmetics and their power over human image is shoddy at best (remember the part where I'm a stereotypical guy?)), nor do I want to wear women's clothing or act like a female. I just want to feel like I'm one.

What I mean is, I want to be a guy, but I don't want to be handsome. I don't want to be suave or dapper or anything like it. I want to be a guy, but I want to be pretty.

SO, my question after all that is this: Firstly, is this a genderqueer type of feeling, and if so, can any of you offer me any advice? If it is not, can you identify what this feeling is, and direct me to something/one/place that could help me?

**EDIT:** ok so it's genderqueer. K. Now, can any of you help me with how I should act on these feelings?

My names Avery, and I'm FAAB, androgynous leaning genderqueer. Let me tell you a little about myself. I'm proud of being a woman, but I'm also proud of being genderqueer. My physical sex is different from my gender (most of the time) but I am proud of both. I feel women are strong people who have seen lots of hardship in our history, and I'm proud of my female identity. I'm also very proud of my androgynous leaning identity, and I actually present as mostly male. It's weird for me to put it out there so plainly, but I figure if anyone does, the people who will most understand it outside of my best friends, would be in this subreddit.

I do have a lot of dysphoria, and it mostly connects to 2 things. One is my weight, and one is my chest. Right now I'm 234 lbs, and at 5'4"" it really shows. I've been working out and have begun to lose weight, so that I can handle on my own.

My chest, however, is a bigger problem. I don't want it at all. For awhile I thought I might go in for another reduction when the time comes, but I doubt that getting A cups is going to be possible. I have been putting more and more thought into the idea of a total top surgery.

Is it possible for someone who isn't taking T to do this? Does anyone know of a person who has had this sort of experience? I know that mastectomies are done, of course, for women suffering from breast cancer, but would any surgeon do top surgery on a non-binary trans person who isn't on hormones?

I never felt like I was a girl, but rather a boy who enjoyed stereotypical girl things on occasion. As I've gotten older interacting with women has become more and more complicated because I don't understand most of them the way people seem to expect I should. I prefer to be around men most of the time since we share a lot of the same interest and for the most part can get along much more easily. Problem is, my having a female body seems to get in the way of us being friends and me being able to just be one of the boys. They see me as a woman, no matter what I do, and there's often this weird sexual tension on their end that they express awkwardly and I wind up not being able to be their platonic friend and more of that friend they not so secretly want to hook up with. They don't treat me the same way as they do their guy friends, and it gets so frustrating I often have to end the friendship. 

I have never much liked my body because I always felt it restricted me socially. I don't feel like I'm a woman, though I don't really feel like I'm a man. I feel like I culturally fit what's perceived as masculine in my culture when it comes to a lot of I do mentally, but in some cases I find I can enjoy more culturally considered feminine things. 
  I strongly believe most of these behaviors are just behaviors and have no real gender, but they have labeled by American culture as gendered behaviors. When I ponder what gender I am, I feel neutral about it most of the time. The only time I feel female is when I'm talking to people about sexual experiences, since a lot of women and I have similar experiences due to our shared anatomy. 

I found out about gender neutral pronouns, I'm sure some of you have heard of them. Ze instead of he or she and hir instead of her or him. I like this idea, and am completely on board with it. I tried to get my partner (who adamantly prefers the term boyfriend for himself and girlfriend for me) to start using gender neutrals when referring to me, but he says he can't do that. He is a heterosexual cisgendered male, but he isn't some villain as some LGBT people make him out to be. He accepts my bisexuality, something other men could only do in theory but not in practice. He has been here for me through a lot of things and despite having challenges we've made it to almost the two year mark. We rarely fight because we're mentally in sync most the time and when we do argue, we work it out right then and there. This is a person who loves me for all those quirks and oddities I have. He knows I'm never going to be a traditional female and he loves me for it. 
 That being said, I'm afraid this might be too much for him. He will never be able to use gender neutral pronouns, he will never be able to not view me as female on some level because of his...how did he put this...having sex with me? I can't word it right. The general idea is there. 
I tried taking on an androgynous style of dress, and he was uncomfortable with it. I had felt good about it, but then he acted awkward and made jokes and it made me feel unsure and gave up on it. (He was more supportive of me not shaving than this oddly enough.)

2013-01-31 21:44:06,17njyd,1,4,"Note: sorry for the long text, and this is a throw-away account.

I think I'm genderqueer. I know my body doesn't suit my true identification. Where do I go from there?

I have a lot of sexual strugles and issues. I was raised as an androgynous tomboy girl in a shitty backward conservative poop hole. With people denying my birth assigned gender, accusing me of being gay or a guy and invalidating me, all of that forced me into a whole struggle to fit the gender status quo: dating guys to prove I'm not gay and an actual girl etc. This, without a doubt, fucked me up deeply. Years of therapy + pschotherapy + suicidal tendencies + very low self esteem and self loath after sex confirms this.

I just got out of a cis heterosexual relationship and came out to my parents (who totally ignored the issue) that I'm possibly gay and want to start dating girls. I'm currently dating a lovely trans woman, my first gay experience, and have been tagging a long with her in the community. I've been learning a lot and been trying to finally find an identity.

I dont want to be labeled something else than a woman. I struggled a lot to accept this for years and years. Revoking this would shatter my world. I dont want to eliminate it. But I'm also aware that I dislike female pronouns in a way. I feel like I'm being sexualized. (surprise surprise...) I've been trying to experience with different pronouns but I fail at keeping up. The male one did not work with me at all. I use the gender neutral ones without even noticing sometimes.

As far as sexuality go, do genderqueers experience hate towards their genitals? does anyone experience deep self loath after sex? even though I wanted to do it and I'm horny, sometimes i can feel a crisis coming and I really have to stop myself from actually doing it so I dont break down and cry my eyes out during sex and run into the shower.

I dislike the look of penises but I guess they feel good inside of me in a horrific shameful way. I'm ashamed. Deeply. I feel dominated with penetration and I hate it. Seeing semen dripping down on my thighs made me want to barf. And I cant believe I put up with this shit just cause ""all women do it"". Accepting my woman hood was always some sort of a ""giving in to the bullies"" feeling. I want to change. I want to liberate myself. I'm tired of this. I want sex to feel good without guilt and shame.

Often, I wish I could be asexual and agender in a way. I've looked up hysterectomy, and the idea of cutting my genitals and sexual parts is infact appealing to me. I've also looked up chemical castration. Infact, I enjoy my ssri for that benefit mostly.

As far as clothing goes, I've been experiencing with more feminine clothing recently when I feel happy. However, on an everyday basis, I aim for the androgynous / butch /edgy type of look even though I look quiet feminine now with long hair.

Any guidance, comments, anything, especially some mirroring and validation will be deeply appreciated.

What this all leads to is I feel like I'm a lesbian in that I'm attracted to women and feel like a woman in many romantic ways, but the straight women I have been with have always been missing a certain je ne sais quoi that makes me feel like they are really seeing me as I am and not just a man who sometimes puts on a skirt.

Since it\'s not super possible to have a body that is both in the way that I would want I am fine with having a male body, but it makes me feel all the more feminine on the inside, perhaps to compensate.  \n\nWhat this all leads to is I feel like I\'m a lesbian in that I\'m attracted to women and feel like a woman in many romantic ways, but the straight women I have been with have always been missing a certain je ne sais quoi that makes me feel like they are really seeing me as I am and not just a man who sometimes puts on a skirt.  I\'ve discussed this on here with someone before, but it\'s been weighing on my mind a lot lately.  Not sure how to find a girly girl who likes my particular blend of gender.  It\'s hard to nail down a specific way to talk about something so conceptual, but maybe you all know what I mean already and I\'m just rambling now.  I guess I just wanted to put it out there and gather thoughts, too scared to post it to r/actuallesbians lol  though I feel like a kindred spirit I worry my body gets in the way sometimes.

I feel like a ''woman'' (I don't have a problem with my bio body) but in my head I'm ''me''. Not a woman, not a man and not nothing. I'm me. Sometimes I feel like a man in a woman body, sometimes I feel like I'm a ''real '' woman, most of the time I'm just being me. 

I'm an heterosexual who doesn't mind a bit of erotic tension with other woman but I'm not really attracted sexually to them like I am toward men.

I've never felt homophobia and trans people never gave me that ''ew'' vibe, I felt like boys were ''just like me'' , as if even as a kid I never gave a fuck. I do remember however HATING to be told to act like a girl, I cursed my genitals often for taking me from being ''me"""". I can't tell if I just internalized and HATE sexism toward my own gender?

What's up with that? Does not having a mental gender actually exist or I'm just ''confused'' ?

Is it possible to just be a ''normal person who does not give a fuck'' without really having any issues?
