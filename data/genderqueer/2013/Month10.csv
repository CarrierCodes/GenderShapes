Even though I couldn't finish the show, I guess it hit home so much because I wish with all my being that I had been born male. While I present myself as a tall, thin, softly feminine ex-varsity soccer player I am incredibly unhappy with my gender. 

When I was little my catchphrase was ""I wish I was a boy"" and I made a point of avoiding all things deemed 'girly' my parents were great in letting me explore. Even after growing out of that general 'I want to be a boy' thought, I was quite a tomboy up until high school where I gradually feminized myself, mostly to fit in and mostly because I guess I had convinced myself that it was what I wanted.

Fast forward to college and I settled more into myself, donning a more tomboy-chic but still feminine fashion style. Any gender identity thoughts tucked away.

Then I got a girlfriend last April, and she was bi and leaned more towards men. Like a freight train it just opened the floodgates of apparently suppressed desire to be male, it probably didn't help that I knew if I had a male physique she would have been all over me.

Fast forward to yesterday, and she tells me she hasn't even noticed we'd been dating 5 months, and that lately she's been thinking she likes hanging out with me as more of a friend than a girlfriend. Calling me ""literally her best friend right now"" We never had sex, I never even got her shirt off because she would get uneasy and respecting her feelings I more or less kept the physicality to a level that wasn't too heavy or intimate. We only even had a heavy make-out session maybe 3 times max.(complicated, this is the short version)

I should have let those red flags tell me to drop it but I kept her around because aside from anxiety towards removal of clothing/sex she never behaved in a way that made me think she was possibly doubting things. She was always affectionate. 

I guess...now I've just sunk into this depressive self-loathing state because I know things would be different with her if I were male. It's hard to accept yourself when every part of you is screaming to get out, but you cant escape your own skin so theres nothing to do.

Here's the short(ish) of it;
I am born female, age 25, married to a man, but bisexual with a slight male preference.
Grew up tomboyish, boy's clothes and toys and friends. Saw being 'girly' as weakness and failure, kept my love of flowers and love stories a secret.
Started wearing women's clothes only recently; long hair, small boobs, kind of androgynous face and voice.

I can't see myself as a woman. I don't want a sex change. A friend told me about the word 'genderfluid' and it seems to describe my confusion very well.

When I dress as a girl, I feel attractive, but insecure and unsafe. I bought my first ever purse this week, and had an explosion of self-doubt and insecurity. Simultaneously, I am proud to be a woman who is so different and unique.
When I dress as a boy (jeans and t-shirt, bound chest, hair is too long to do anything with; feel uncomfortable about that), I feel safe, more invisible (I feel stared at as a girl) and that there are less expectations being made of me for some reason. I just feel calm, I guess.

I don't know where to go or who to talk to about this. I don't even know fully what I'm looking to do (crossdress? become androgynous? get a therapist?). I just feel very confused. My husband is being very supportive of me, and has given me his assurance that I'm me, and he loves me, though it is hard for him to understand (especially since I have no idea what's going on either).

Perhaps some general reading, maybe some other girls who are neither here nor there, or just some basic advice would help me understand myself.

Simultaneously, I am proud to be a woman who is so different and unique.\nWhen I dress as a boy (jeans and t-shirt, bound chest, hair is too long to do anything with; feel uncomfortable about that), I feel safe, more invisible (I feel stared at as a girl) and that there are less expectations being made of me for some reason.

However, I've run into a problem. I am having an issue using ""they"" in reference to a singular person. Like using ""they said"" in place of ""he said"" or ""she said,"" etc.

I've seen examples online of the pronoun ""ze"" used by the trans* or genderqueer communities, but I wasn't sure how to proceed.

Really for the past year I haven't been really sure about gender and every damn time I think I'm getting somewhere suddenly there's a damn curveball that leaves me confused and feeling like an idiot. For example, yesterday. I wake up feeling a bit like a girl. Day progresses further, massive dysphoria that leaves me hating myself, thinking that my body is disgusting, and wanting to die. Cry for an hour. A little bit later, I feel a bit more content and less like I want to jump out a window. Next thing I know it's 7 PM and suddenly I end up feeling like I'm a guy. A feminine guy, but still a guy. And I feel stupid. Why the hell does a guy spend an hour crying about not being a girl and then legitimately not giving a damn that night?

For my entire life I felt kind of different, we can all agree that I've never been normal so this is no surprise. For the last year or so I've stopped ignoring the feelings and have started to really pay attention to them. It sucks and I hate every single thing that these feelings have taught me. If I could not be this way I most certainly would, believe me. It's literally my most hated thing. 
Mom has noticed that I've been struggling a lot lately, dad maybe you have too, I don't know. Mom you've been asking me what's wrong and I keep saying either ""nothing"" or ""same old same old"" because I really don't want to hurt anyone. I've realized though that this is my life, and sometimes what happens in my life will hurt other people but if those people love me than they love me for me and not for anything else. 
My entire life I've been struggling with both my sexuality and gender. Almost a year ago I came to terms with my sexuality and I'm pretty sure everyone as pretty much accepted it's not going to go away at this point. 
The thing I'm messaging you about right now is that my gender identity, or lack thereof, has caused me serious issues. The term I kind of started using to describe myself is gender queer (I'm going to include the wikipedia page link for that at the bottom of this). I don't know if that's true though. I've been talking to a lot of people and doing a lot of research and self reflection and quite honestly I'm terrified I might be transgendered (that would be the part I hate, there will also be a link for that at the bottom, its not as scary as it seems i swear). I don't know what or who I am though, and right now I just need support because i don't think i can do it on my own anymore. 
I just know that I actually despise myself, I don't think a person can ever hate me as much as I hate myself. Only since I started accepting my gender shortcomings I kinda feel a bit better. 
I don't know what I'm going to do about it, but yeah, now you guys know.

However, it took me nearly two decades to come to terms with the fact that I am not comfortable being female-bodied.

I started binding nearly a week ago and I am loving it so much. I love binding, it has made me feel so much better about myself and my body. I actually feel confident in my appearance every time I see a flat chest on me. I am 100% certain that I want to get top surgery when I am older and can afford it. However, I'm not exactly sure how I feel about going on T.

I'm hairy and don't shave: I have a happy trail (which before would make me feel bad, but now I actually like it a lot and I'm glad that it's there) and have a little moustache going on.

2013-10-20 19:53:14,1oupoj,9,5,"Story time... Sorry if this is on the long side. I'd love some conversation/feedback/response/community/advice.

About two months ago, I told myself I'd start playing with identification as genderqueer. I've been out as various queer identities since I was 16 - I'm almost 20 now - and I've been a really involved trans ally for most of that time. I was always just cis and that was cool - I actually loved the process of learning to check my privilege and learning about others' experiences. But as I got older/more involved, I kept having stuff to share from my own experience (but kept quiet because it felt like I was appropriating trans experience). I had always accepted my gender, though with a grim kind of fatalism - I was one of those girls building camaraderie with other women over how terrible it was to have boobs/period or be weak/cold/emotional/etc. When I started coming to terms with how messed up that was, I just thought it was internalized misogyny. But the more feminist I became and the more I learned to love femininity (in the abstract, in other people, in myself), the more dysphoria I had.

I felt terrible about using the word ""dysphoria"" when it first occurred to me that it applied. For one, I don't have the crippling depression symptoms my binary trans friends have. I didn't really think about gender other than in terms of vague annoyance until I started learning about it and getting involved with the LGBT world... and when I did, I was hooked, I couldn't get enough of researching and reading and whatever. I cannot shake the feeling that I did this to myself - that because I started learning about it, I'm straddled with this now and can't go back.

See, I thought I was just experimenting with an identity label when I came out genderqueer to myself, and when I tried drag for the first time, and when I played around with masculine and neutral names. But then I got hooked. It just felt so right and it was so validating that no matter how ... tolerable any dysphoria I had before had been, I couldn't get it off my mind anymore because I'd seen/felt the alternative.

So now I actually can't go out without binding - even in a sports bra - without wanting to rip my chest off. I've had dreams that I just decided to give myself top surgery.

Sorry if this is on the long side. I\'d love some conversation/feedback/response/community/advice.\n\nAbout two months ago, I told myself I\'d start playing with identification as genderqueer. I\'ve been out as various queer identities since I was 16 - I\'m almost 20 now - and I\'ve been a really involved trans ally for most of that time. I was always just cis and that was cool - I actually loved the process of learning to check my privilege and learning about others\' experiences. But as I got older/more involved, I kept having stuff to share from my own experience (but kept quiet because it felt like I was appropriating trans experience). I had always accepted my gender, though with a grim kind of fatalism - I was one of those girls building camaraderie with other women over how terrible it was to have boobs/period or be weak/cold/emotional/etc. When I started coming to terms with how messed up that was, I just thought it was internalized misogyny. But the more feminist I became and the more I learned to love femininity (in the abstract, in other people, in myself), the more dysphoria I had.\n\nI felt terrible about using the word ""dysphoria"" when it first occurred to me that it applied. For one, I don\'t have the crippling depression symptoms my binary trans friends have. I didn\'t really think about gender other than in terms of vague annoyance until I started learning about it and getting involved with the LGBT world... and when I did, I was hooked, I couldn\'t get enough of researching and reading and whatever. I cannot shake the feeling that I did this to myself - that because I started learning about it, I\'m straddled with this now and can\'t go back.\n\nSee, I thought I was just experimenting with an identity label when I came out genderqueer to myself, and when I tried drag for the first time, and when I played around with masculine and neutral names. But then I got hooked. It just felt so right and it was so validating that no matter how ... tolerable any dysphoria I had before had been, I couldn\'t get it off my mind anymore because I\'d seen/felt the alternative.\n\nSo now I actually can\'t go out without binding - even in a sports bra - without wanting to rip my chest off.

2013-10-20 23:20:55,1ov5hl,13,22,"Hi, /r/genderqueer! 

I am currently involved with a genderqueer person (I am a cisgendered female and identify as a lesbian). I would not go so far as to call them my partner, but they are certainly a huge part of my life and I care for them very, very much. 

They have been experiencing a lot of dysphoria lately, and it really sucks. I can tell that it upsets them more than they let on, and I hate that I can't be there more for them (LDR). I try my hardest to make them laugh and remind them that non-binary-gendered people are just as awesome as anyone else. They seem to feel better after these conversations, but I'm never totally sure. 

I screenshotted parts of our earlier conversation (blurring out names and some *ahem* ^^lovey-dovey stuff) when they were experiencing some intense dysphoria. (Sorry about my stupid humour, I kinda got a bit off there for a minute.)

Imgur is nopeing so there are 9 separate images, so sorry. :(

2013-10-22 02:10:48,1oy5w9,11,4,"""What pronouns do you prefer?""

I know that this question comes from the sincerest of places, and I really do understand why it's the best way to ask for relevant information. 

But it makes me feel really anxious. It makes me sweat. It makes me start hedging and trying to avoid answering. Because my answer to that specific question is complicated. If I was asked, ""What is your gender identity?"" well that's a simple answer. I identify as genderqueer. 

Pronouns? Well sometimes I prefer masculine, sometimes feminine, sometimes neutral. All depending on my mood. And which one is appropriate is not always reflected by my mode of dress or mannerisms or any cue others could easily use to tell. I dislike feeling the need to choose a pronoun almost as much as I dislike feeling the need to choose a gender.

More to the point though, I don't want to be a pain. I don't want my friends to stress about how they refer to me. I also don't want my gender to be something they have to actively think about every time they talk about me. And I personally feel like given the rarity of neutral pronoun use in English, asking for them puts far more emphasis on my gender than I'm comfortable with. Except that neutral pronouns are the best compromise I can find. 

So what I normally find myself saying in response to the pronoun question is, ""Whatever is easiest for you."" And I know that ends up being a totally unhelpful cop-out, but I just can't bring myself to request anything specific. 

Does anyone else have issues with the pronoun question? Should I just suck it up and ask for neutral pronouns given they're an OKish compromise for me? I mean, if they're aware enough to ask the question, surely they're okay with respecting whatever I request?

2013-10-24 02:02:11,1p3g1t,8,6,"Hello. I'm as faab as the Beatles, and genderfluid leaning towards male. I get read as male pretty damn consistently. To be more specific, I get read as a 12 year old male pretty consistently, and even when I presented female I got read as being much younger than I am. My body didn't puberty much: i have small breasts relative to my weight, and I have a more square chest and shoulders than most women, so it actually kind of looks like I have a male-ish chest that just happens to have boobs attached. I have a fairly androgynous build in general, and a lot of the time I feel like I never went through puberty in the first place.

This is beginning to frustrate me deeply. In fact, its becoming my biggets source of dysphoria: I look in the mirror, and I see a child when I should at least *resemble* an adult by now. I'm not even sure if I want top surgery anymore, because when I press down on my chest I just see a child in the mirror, and when I do that I'm looking for a young man. My chest was the first thing I ever felt dysphoric about, and now I actually find it comforting, because with breasts I can see a young woman instead of a 10 year old child. At the same time, lately I've been rubbing the little hairs on my face, imagining what it would be like to have stubble.

The question of taking T has been in the back of my mind for some time now. I can get access to a gender therapist, and plan to to talk through what's going on. At the same time, I will soon be taking birth control in order to regulate ny hormone levels (fun fact for any Faab ADHDers here: if you still have a menstrual cycle, it can fuck with your adhd symptoms and your response to medication.)  Which means should I choose it, I would be taking something that would feminise my body to some extent, which might make me see an adult in the mirror, but could also make me get read as female more often. On the other hand, I'm scared to take T, even though I have days when it feels like any day now, my body is going to sponteneously grow taller and my voice drop.

2013-10-26 11:26:14,1p91qx,5,5,"So I (think I) am a cis male, and lately I've been keeping myself up at night wondering about gender identity. If anything, I'm probably slightly gender queer since I don't think I really want to be a woman and I don't have any dysphoria, but being 100% a man 100% of the time doesn't feel *quite* right.

The problem is, I also have health anxiety. I'm used to keeping myself up at night convincing myself that the slight posture related aches and pains in the left side of my chest are definitely a sign of imminent heart failure. I'm used to keeping myself up at night convincing myself the pressure headaches I started getting after moving to a new climate are definitely because I have a brain tumor.

Now, to be clear, I don't think being trans* or genderqueer is a health defect, but this process of keeping myself up at night thinking about it definitely feels a lot like my health anxiety. 

I stay up at night telling myself ""You feel like cis male is pretty close to correct but not quite a perfect label? It must be because you're a transwoman and now you have to get hormones and SRS and you have to come out and you have to deal with so much transphobia for the rest of your life including your own semi-conscious transphobia because you know it's there and all of this is going to be compounded by your anxiety and it's going *to suck.* Let's deal with this by reading about all the complications that sometimes happen in all of the various types of sexual reassignment surgeries because that worked really well when we were reading articles on WebMD about how headaches are definitely a sign of brain tumors.""

What's most frustrating about this is that I'm spending all my time wrestling with gender and because of my hang ups I feel like I'm spending all of my time in a debate that I can't advance in any direction. I convince myself I'm cis and then say 'but that's probably just your unconscious transphobia combined with a fear of the process of transitioning combined with trying in vain to talk your way out of your own anxiety,' so I bounce back to 'I'm definitely trans*' and then I remind myself 'this feels so much like 'I definitely have a heart problem' or 'this headache is definitely a sign of something serious.'

Basically, I don't trust myself to come to any possible conclusion about the questions I have, so I'm stuck in this debate which is making me anxious and costing me sleep.

I had a picture of a baby seal on my wall and I would stare at it at night and cry, just the thought of something small and vulnerable... The only thing I could relate to. I had little fits of emotion like that everywhere, and I was told I was wrong in every institution I was exposed to. The psychiatrists, teachers, other kids who would call me names and push me around.. beginning to dig a hole. I hate the male roles I was forced to learn to accept at that age, and the miserable repression that followed into my teens. I hate male sexuality. I hate the insecurity and jealousy that I felt trying to ""embrace"" it, and the overcompensating I did, which only dug the hole deeper, until I couldn't feel anything. Eventually, the softness was replaced with cold, jagged anxiety. I want to cry, but that guilt creeps up and stops me dead. Guilt for feeling empathy and vulnerability. Shame for wanting to be cute and maybe even asexual. I hate being a man. I'm scared to be a woman. I want to cry, but it doesn't work anymore. The hole is too deep. All the baby animals I wanted to cuddle with, and the cartoon violence that once devastated me, all buried beneath rust and filthy lies. My body is wrong. I only want to feel the softness again. fleeting echoes come and go, suddenly flushed out by past insecurities I thought I was over with. I can't even relate to sex right now, at this moment. I can't relate to my body... I'm scared to lose the people who think they know me, and I'm scared to keep them believing the lies I was forced to believe.

He and I have been talking about it recently and he is still attracted to me when I am binding and presenting masculinely. I've been hovering more and more on the more masculine end of things lately.. He says he will still be attracted to me post top surgery (I am looking for a flat, nipple-less chest, not a male-looking one) and even post T, if I decide to take any. I am not sure if he still would be sexually attracted to me if I identified as FTM and went through with bottom surgery, etc., but it sounds like he would be. He says a lot of the time that his sexuality is ""based on me,"" because I am such a large part of it. He isn't demi, though.

Before I came out, he was not attracted to trans* people of any stripe, except perhaps ""post-op"" or ""very societally passable"" (I can't think of a better word for it, sorry :( ) trans women.

I'm a fan of putting labels on things and putting them in boxes, so I asked him casually what he would call his orientation. He said pansexual would probably fit best, but he didn't really know.
