I wear a lot of men's clothes, have a masculine haircut, wear a binder, don't shave my legs or pits, etc, but since I'm not on T or anything I just get read as a butch woman.

Anyway, recently it seems like all my friends are coming out as various non-binary gender. And for some reason this makes me feel very uncomfortable. I'm not sure if I'm afraid that other people will think they're ""transtrenders"" and then tar me with same brush (so far none of them have altered their gender presentation away from the gender they were assigned at birth - but then I haven't really either), or if maybe deep inside I actually think they're just trying on genders for the fun of it? (Note that I go to a very very liberal college and being gender nonconforming is definitely more of a positive trait here than a negative one, at least in my circles).

I wear a lot of men\'s clothes, have a masculine haircut, wear a binder, don\'t shave my legs or pits, etc, but since I\'m not on T or anything I just get read as a butch woman.\n\nAnyway, recently it seems like all my friends are coming out as various non-binary gender. And for some reason this makes me feel very uncomfortable. I\'m not sure if I\'m afraid that other people will think they\'re ""transtrenders"" and then tar me with same brush (so far none of them have altered their gender presentation away from the gender they were assigned at birth - but then I haven\'t really either), or if maybe deep inside I actually think they\'re just trying on genders for the fun of it? (Note that I go to a very very liberal college and being gender nonconforming is definitely more of a positive trait here than a negative one, at least in my circles).\n\nBasically I clearly have some sort of insecurity or internalized whatever going on - I was very happy when the same friends realized they were queer - and I\'d really like to feel supportive of my friends instead of uncomfortable.

2015-05-06 09:08:07,351gp1,10,4,"Hi,

I am here because I would really appreciate some unbiased thoughts on my situation. 

I am a married biological male in my early 30s, and for years I have been struggling with some gender identity issues. I look and act like the average man, but the truth is that I have a very strong... how shall I call it... ""unmasculine"" side. Part of me longs for everything that is commonly stereotyped as being ""feminine"" (or ""Yin"", if you will), from behaviour to clothing to sexuality, but most important of all, that part of me wishes to be acknowledged by the world. Thing is, I also have a male part, and that part is obviously more aligned with the kind of characteristics, behavioural, visual and sexual, commonly associated with manliness.

The net result is, as you can imagine, a mess: part of me wishes to grow a full beard, the other part wants his (her? Its?) legs shaved. Sometimes I'll see a pretty woman on the street and while part of me will picture her in a variety of lustful scenarios, the other part will think *""I wish I could fill that dress like that""*. And these are just simple, aesthetics-related examples. I could also discuss the emotional, behavioural and sexual aspects, but I think you get what I'm trying to say: I want things that are completely incompatible with each other. I want to be manly, but at the same time I want to be feminine. To make matters worse, these two sides never really balance out, but kind of fluctuate over time: I can go through a six month ""manly"" spell, and then one day, for no obvious reason, my other side will erupt and suddenly I find myself daydreaming of how nice, how *fulfilling* it would feel to be a housewife (please, feminists of reddit, don't hate me for this: believe me, I *know* being a woman is *not* defined by cooking, ironing shirts and making the husband happy at night, I *know* that women can be as ambitious and achieve great things as much as men, and I am in no way trying to suggest otherwise: I am only talking about what part of me desires, *please* do not try read any kind of gender role judgement into this).

My wife doesn't know. I'm pretty sure I would have told her if I had known at the beginning, but I only came to fully understand my feelings several years into our relationship and by then, I couldn't find the courage in me to tell her (and I don't intend to, either: I know for a fact that she would suffer greatly).

So, now you more or less know what my problem is. My questions to you are: what am I? Right now I only know what I'm not: I'm not a woman, but I don't fully feel like a man, I'm not gay, but I'm not heterosexual either, I'm not a crossdresser and I'm not transgender (because, honestly, I think I'd still not feel completely comfortable as a woman, although possibly slightly more comfortable than now). So what the heck am I? Is there a name for people like me? And also, is there anything I can do to give my ""unmasculine"" side some much needed relief while staying safely in the closet?

It’s just only in the past 3 to 4 years i ever really found the words to describe myself with any amount accuracy. So a few days ago told my two friends (who are brother and sister) to start using “they/them” pronouns… 

Now they knew I considered myself genderqueer/fluid I mostly used the term genderfuild with them. Since I could explain that better, in my option back then. That and when I first told them I tended to use genderfuild and genderqueer interchangeably. But I know now I am more in the genderqueer camp than fluid since my gender does not shift too much if at all. (Sorry tangent) 

Now when I told them to use “they/them” pronouns the sister started to right away, no problem few mistakes here or there but the effort to make the change was clear!

The brother on the other hand is refusing. Just straight out refusing. Here is a link to the skype talks we have in the past couple of days, I edited out my name (which I dislike), and his sister’s, his username is not his real one so I left it as is.

So all in all I’m just all sorts of frustrated right now and the thing is, I’m not sure if I am over reacting or not. I just feel justified since this is the start of me reclaiming of who I am. But I the same time I been his friend for a few years now and the way he is being too stubborn? Is I guess, is just disheartening to me.

I mean we had our clashes before on things, but I guess it was stuff I could let slide. But identity about who I am. Not a chance and mostly, I am wondering what do I do now. Just, continue to try reason with him, so he’ll use my proper pronouns, or do I drop the friendship like I have told him I would if he won’t use my proper pronouns? What do I do? 

TLDR: Guy Friend refuses to use my preferred pronouns, should I try and salvage friendship or no?

(Sorry tangent) \n\nNow when I told them to use “they/them” pronouns the sister started to right away, no problem few mistakes here or there but the effort to make the change was clear!\n\nThe brother on the other hand is refusing. Just straight out refusing. Here is a link to the skype talks we have in the past couple of days, I edited out my name (which I dislike), and his sister’s, his username is not his real one so I left it as is. [Link]( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nXJlhJenXdKA2cws1ij_Gz5tl9imEUWJRKwxhf6-4to/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nSo all in all I’m just all sorts of frustrated right now and the thing is, I’m not sure if I am over reacting or not. I just feel justified since this is the start of me reclaiming of who I am. But I the same time I been his friend for a few years now and the way he is being too stubborn? Is I guess, is just disheartening to me.\n\nI mean we had our clashes before on things, but I guess it was stuff I could let slide. But identity about who I am. Not a chance and mostly, I am wondering what do I do now. Just, continue to try reason with him, so he’ll use my proper pronouns, or do I drop the friendship like I have told him I would if he won’t use my proper pronouns? What do I do? \n\nTLDR: Guy Friend refuses to use my preferred pronouns, should I try and salvage friendship or no?\n\nEdit: ended up talking a little more to him, updated Skype conversation accordingly.

Background info: I'm 17, in a fairly small school with students that are relatively xenophobic towards anything not the norm. 

I decided to start with my science teacher since I trusted him. Handed him a note about it and so he asked if I could help him set up a lab after school which I agreed to. 

I proceeded to start a text conversation with my girlfriend about it, and had to explain the entire concept to her. She was confused and brought up a decent fuss about it, but I had to put the conversation on pause as we both had to get through class. 

So after school I'm setting up a lab with my science teacher (his biology class was doing a lab on fly genetics). We started talking about it and I was scared out of my mind but he was pretty accepting. He even agreed to use gender neutral pronouns if I ever fully came out (made me ecstatic).

So after I start heading home I continue the conversation with my girlfriend. Now, she's the one person who could say a word and break me with that word. We've been together in a long distance relationship for over four years now, and even met recently (I flew to her state for the weekend over summer break).

We get to the point where I ask her to start using gender neutral pronouns and here's where she flips the actual heck out. She calls me, yelling at me for it and saying she will NOT refer to me as anything but male, EVER. This is where I tried to end the conversation because I was starting to break down. I told her that I had to get started on my homework, which was partially true. As soon as the call ended I locked myself away and cried for ages. 

That hit me, and hit me hard. She was the one person I had hoped to accept me being third gender, but she didn't. I feel like a broken image of myself. I love her more than anything but I've been having a hard time dealing with just talking to her on the phone and I'm scared she'll leave me if I bring it up again.

I grew up going between the parentally enforced ""girly girl"" phase, and my self-chosen ""tomboy"" phase. I hung out with boys as a child and didn't fit in well with many girls, and then as I got older completely reversed that. In my 22 years of life I feel like I’ve been in a well matched Tennis match and constantly in a volley.
My earliest memory of not really feeling like a girl was around the age of 9. Leading up to this age I had an occurrence here or there of trying to “pee like the boys”, outside and everything. But when I was around 9 I had sat through my first sex ed class and started learning about male and female genitalia. I don’t know if it’s “penis envy” or what but at that point I had wished more than anything that I had been born with a penis. I even tried my best to fashion on out of an old doll bottle and tape, and actually use it to pee… That was an unpleasant, awkward, messy experience. 


Fast forward to the beginning of college. I had come out in high-school as a lesbian, then bi, and then as a lesbian, and then finally as pansexual (My sexuality fluidity is another story that will come up later). I grew into the butchy tomboy look in highschool and really started feeling comfortable dressing in men’s clothes when I started college, but every so often these short lived urges would come over me to dress and appear more feminine. I’d throw on a dress but it would feel like a charade. They made me feel uncomfortable and confining. My wardrobe slowly turned more and more masculine and I started shopping only from the mens section. I started becoming more comfortable with who I was and had the benefit of the reaffirmation from my boyfriend at the time, and that’s when I finally started to delve into my gender confusion. 


I remember all the conversation I had with my boyfriend, “would we be together if I was a guy”, “sometimes I wish I could experience an orgasm from the male perspective”, “Sometimes I wish I was having gay sex with you” were some of the topics and I’ve since come to think about those encounters. A lot of times when I am with men I am wishing I could be with men in a gay way. On the flip side when I am with a women I sometimes wish I could be with her in a typical heterosexual way. And then other times I’m completely fine with the way that I am having sex with them. Honestly I still haven’t figured it out.

My mom (father is out of the picture) is coming into town for the week for the occasion, which will probably be one of two times I see her this year because opposite coasts. She is liberal and openminded, pro-gay rights and all that jazz, but I doubt she knows about anything other  than the general mtf/ftm trans narrative which the media is fond-ish of. 




My family is not good at being close, supportive, or open. Think aspberger and social anxiety stereotypes and you won't be wrong. BUT she and I have actually been developing a mo-dau relationship over the last year or so and I think my coming out may bring us a lot closer. SO IDFK. I strongly think she would be supportive but would not get it at all.

 


This is directly relevant to the name change as she is partially a cause of the name change AND is bringing my birth cert and stuff so I can do it next week. She WILL notice and ask if I do something unexpected like the following.





On the name. I am for sure changing my last name. When my parents split, my mom took her mother's maiden and I stuck w/ my father's for the time being because money, but I want to embrace the family history of the name my mom took (crazy badass), and I hate my father and his name, plus I want to be proud of whatever name I have as Dr. ______.


ON TOP OF WHICH, I am keeping my first name as it is awesome, but am rather torn on my middle. I am genderfluid and have a male name which has seriously stuck over the last 2 or so months. I am strongly considering taking my male name as a middle name to embrace that part of my identity, but I have only had my dude name for a really short amount of time.


It flows s
uper well as (current first)(male)(Marie)(baaaadass last).




Yes of course I can wait a bit to actually do the change, but kinda have to do it in the next couple months so that I can apply to med school and update my passport and id easily.




**Actual input part**
(1) thoughts on using my male name as an extra middle name?
(2) I have only had my male name for a couple months, but it has seriously stuck and I cannot really imagine taking another name, but I cannot help but feel I would be rushing to take my male name when I take my last name because convenience, so thoughts?

First, I am not out to anyone but a few friends and my SO. AFAB and gq possibly ftm... Still figuring everything out.

I was feeling down yesterday and wore some of my moms clothes and dressed like she would, in honor of Mother's Day (she passed away last year) so today I wanted to be more of myself and androgynous. I put on a binder, packer and shorts and a tshirt. I looked in the mirror and all I could see was an ugly girl. I felt out of place and shameful.

 I changed into a pretty gender blending outfit with cowboy boots, a skirt and a flannel shirt. I'm still wearing my binder but no packer. Because of practical reasons (it's cold, the outfit is cozy, my packer is itchy), this outfit is better, but I feel like I'm betraying myself. I couldn't do it- I couldn't put on masculine clothes, I feared retaliation.

I tried to talk to my coworker on our daily morning walk about gender (she and I are both having endo problems for different reasons) but I couldn't do it. I got permission to leave early to run some work related errands and I'm just thankful I can get out of here sooner. I'm distracted and can't focus- plus I just feel shame and disgust towards my body. Mostly that I can't decide even how I identify. Can't wait for therapy tomorrow...

2015-05-13 06:34:07,35syym,8,4,"**TL;DR: FAQ to give people when coming out - silly idea? corrections? suggested questions?**

I've been thinking about coming out as non-binary, but there's something that's bothering me about it. For most people I know it'll be a new concept, so I'd end up answering the same questions over and over - or worse, people might make incorrect assumptions instead of asking. Is it a silly idea to prepare a kind of pre-emptive FAQ to give to people upon coming out? I've written one out as an exercise in thought even if I don't end up using it, so please let me know what you think and whether you would add anything to the list.

**Pre-emptive FAQ for coming out**

* What on earth is ""non-binary"" supposed to mean?

It means not identifying within the gender binary of male and female. In my case you can sort of think of it as being halfway transgender. For instance, if I was a transgender man, I would say ""I am not a woman. I am a man"". Since I'm non-binary, only the first part of that statement applies; I'm not a man either. 

* Nobody fits all the stereotypes of their gender; why do you need a word for it?

I absolutely agree that breaking stereotypes doesn't magically make you a different gender. That is not what's behind this. Gender is an innate identity that you don't choose, and when it doesn't align with how other people see and refer to you, that causes some degree of discomfort. More on that in the next bit.

* How long has this been a thing for you?

Ok, bear with me here. If I've sent this to you, you probably know me well enough to be aware that I'm a bit of a pedant when it comes to grammar. One of my pet peeves, as an example, is of people putting an unnecessary apostrophe in ""its"". Now, imagine one day someone wipes from my mind the awareness of the word ""its"" without the apostrophe. From then on, every time people use ""it's"" incorrectly, I get this vague feeling of frustration that they're wrong; an urge to correct them but without anything to correct to. That's what being referred to as female has felt like for as long as I can remember.  
In the last year or so, I've also noticed some physical dysphoria. For those of you that don't know, and somehow have access to this page but not google, physical gender dysphoria refers to the distress trans people (binary and non-binary) feel about their bodies not being how they should be. I'm not currently intending to do anything to help with this other than wear my chest binder, which gives the appearance of a flat chest.

* What should I do?

Honestly, from your point of view not much changes. I'm still exactly the same person and I don't want this to be a big deal. Please just don't refer to me as a woman, and don't freak out if it looks like my boobs are missing - it's just the binder. Pronoun-wise, referring to me as ""they"" (singular form) instead of ""she"" would be ideal, but I understand that it can sound a bit weird or ambiguous in some situations, and takes some getting used to. I'm not going to kill you if you don't.

* So, are you hexadecimal then?

Come on. I *just* said I'm the exact same person. Do you really think I hadn't already thought of that pun? :P

* I have more questions, can I ask them?

Sure. I almost certainly won't mind answering, and if I do I'll just let you know. Keep in mind though that any answers you're looking for can probably be found by googling as well.

* This is all bullshit/You're just a ""special snowflake""/Stop trying to get attention.

Ok, well, that's not a question, but I'll address it anyway in case some people are thinking it.  
Bullshit? I think it's perfectly reasonable. I'm not saying that my gender is mayonnaise here, and the concept of more than 2 genders is not a new thing; it's been around for a long time in many cultures.

'I find it funny how a smile can hide a broken heart,
and how the masking of your feelings is a secret art.

Would you have seen it coming? I know she hides it well;
the whole world is really under this girl's tragic spell.

Thinking nothing of the glare in her big brown eyes;
little do they know, they're a great disguise.

She wakes up, watches the sun rise, starts reeling off the bucket loads of sad lies.

""Are you alright?""
""Yes,"" she replies.

No one can hear the scream of her internal cries.

She thinks there's no hope and no faith left to give.

Feels no reason and no purpose for her soul to live.

Bully. How could you take this girl, and make her feel secure?
Then go grab your mates, and make her feel impure?
'Cause now she's damaged forever and her thoughts are stained;
With every memory you gave her you should be ashamed.

Bully. Did you like it when you heard her screaming out in pain?
I bet the thought of it, is driving the sweet girl insane.
One of the worst crimes that you could commit;
and for what? Just for your own selfish benefit.

And now she's thinking, ""do I even deserve to live?""
'Cause what you did there is no way she could forgive.
She was so innocent, until that event,
You made an indent, on her presence.:(

Now she's forced to travel down her life on this path.
Guess you really didn't think of the aftermath.
Was it intentional?
Are you delusional?
Did you understand what you were doing at all? Bully.
What a waste of such a precious girl I will admit.
You took advantage of her and now you've ruined it.
And I just hope that one day she will recover;
And a genuine smile she will discover.

Sometimes the outside, it don't mean a thing.
'Cause this girl she's beautiful when you start digging in.
And I'll admit that, there's nothing left to say.
But I promise that everything will be okay. Sweet girl.
And just remember that I'm here for you whenever.
It's gonna be that way with us forever.
'Cause you know that I'm never really very far.
And when you see this post, you'll know who you are.

So I hope you cherish the words that I wrote for you. Girl.
And I admire you for everything you've been through.
You are stronger than you'd ever know I promise you,
Just think back at all those awful things, you know it's true.
You're still standing here, healthy and alive,
And if you truly believe I know that you'll survive!'

The neutrois identity calls to me. Gender-neutral. It feels *so right* in a way nothing has ever felt right before. I feel free and clear and like I'm seeing color for the first time. This is *me*.

At the same time, I've been feeling... doubtful about it? Like I don't ""qualify,"" whatever that means. I thought I was FTM for a bit and tried to identify that way, but it sent me into a spiral of stress and depression and bouts of sobbing that I thought was fear and denial at the time. I now recognize it as dysphoria. I am not a man.

Objectively, putting aside how I feel and just looking at definitions and thoughts, I thought bigender made more sense. I've frequently said or thought I was both a man and a woman and sort of switched between the roles of those two. But it *felt* wrong, in the same way that male and female both felt wrong.

Today I think it's kind of hit me why. I'm not both a man and a woman. I'm neutral between the two. I am neither, with traits of both, and switching between the two was a way to get as close as possible to my real gender when I didn't believe I could be what I am.

I still kind of... worry about adopting the neutrois label, no matter how right it feels. I worry that my flipping back and forth in that way means I'm not neutral. I worry that I don't know if I want surgery or hormones yet. I worry that there's no space for me. I worry that I don't know how much I want to change my presentation. And because I worry about these things, I police them to try and force myself to be all the things I'm imagining a gender neutral person needs to be. I know I need to stop, I know it's counterproductive, but I'm not quite sure how.

The genderqueer and nonbinary labels aren't *wrong*, but they are very imprecise, and because of that, I feel like calling myself either of them is not *really* expressing my gender in the way calling myself neutrois is. And that's important to me, which is part of why I'm trying to get this all figured out.

2015-05-19 01:03:46,36fq75,10,2,"Hello, guys. I'm bipolar and identify as genderfluid (since I will go back and forth between male modes and female modes as well as having times I feel an odd mix of the two or even a lack of the two. It's hard to explain).

I started thinking back on it and realized the fluctuation between genders was a bit similar to my fluctuation between moods (going back and forth between mania and depression as well as becoming hypomanic or almost numb/mixed at times). 

The moods didn't have a direct correlation to my gender mode, as I can be a manic male or a manic female as well as a depressed male or depressed female, so I know the mood cycling and the gender cycling are not in tune with each other. I mention this because for a long time I questioned if it was just my bipolar causing these gender fluctuations, which, of course, made me worry about if those feelings were valid or not.

I started off wondering if they were caused by hormone problems (as starting birth control helped my moods stabilize a bit and I also seemed to have less extreme dysphoria whenever in a male mode (since I'm in a female body)). Because of this, I found that sometimes bipolar's symptoms have been linked to hormonal imbalances! [x](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/attention-please/201310/hormone-imbalance-not-bipolar-disorder) I began to look into if this could affect genderfluidity but seemed to come up with nothing scientifically substantial.

However, it was brought up one day when I was browsing some trans research that the amount of hormones the fetus is exposed to in the womb can possibly be linked to the gender issues one may have later in life. The exposure could change the white matter in the brain, possibly proving that it has a scientific explanation after all! I began looking into how this could possibly link to genderfluidity and found that the thought process of one hemisphere of the brain being more feminine and one hemisphere being more male could contribute to the switching back and forth between genders.

&gt;Finally, our survey found decreased lateralization of handedness in the bigender community. These observations suggest a biologic basis of bigenderism and lead us to propose a novel gender condition, ""alternating gender incongruity"" (AGI). We hypothesize that AGI may be related to an unusual degree or depth of hemispheric switching and corresponding callosal suppression of sex appropriate body maps in parietal cortex- possibly the superior parietal lobule- and its reciprocal connections with the insula and hypothalamus. [x](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22364652)

Those with bipolar disorder have been found to have this same type of hemispheric switching.

&gt;This is based on two lines of reasoning. First, bigender individuals in our survey sample reported an elevated rate of bipolar disorder, which has been linked to slowed hemispheric switching.

Because of this, I have to wonder, are the same things that cause bipolar disorder possibly playing a part in the cause of being bigender/genderfluid? What do you guys think?

I was raised in the United States where the vast majority of people are raised with very binary &amp; stereotypical notions of gender &amp; sexuality. (I feel like someone learning Spanish and am probably sounding like an idiot using terms all wrong without realizing it.)

I don't like being ignorant, and I really want to learn &amp; understand. I have noticed that some folks who aren't cisgender get tired of having to ""explain"" themselves, which makes sense to me, so I've tried to be a quiet observer.

I stumbled upon the Robot Hugs comic strip, which has really helped me to get a better understanding, and I even reached out to them to ask questions, but then they posted [this comic](http://www.robot-hugs.com/derail/) and so I decided to just start doing research.

But it's all so very confusing &amp; I wish I could just *talk* to genderqueer people. You learn more from talking to people &amp; immersing yourself in something than reading articles. I watched the Gender 101 video in the sidebar here, but I want to learn more.

When I wanted to learn more about autism, I sought out people who were on the spectrum, and learned directly from them. It was *vastly* more enriching &amp; informative than if I'd just read articles *about* people on the spectrum.

I respect that you folks aren't in some kind of zoo, and this sub doesn't exist for my own personal field-trip &amp; education, so I don't want to be an asshole and wreck your space. At the same time, I feel like that kid who gets picked last for dodgeball &amp; never gets invited to parties.

2015-05-22 02:52:12,36u0pw,12,2,"Hi. I've always been curious about you folks who don't feel as most seem to about being able to identify with a particular binary gender.

I cannot personally understand this since my worldview is admittedly binary and normative in that respect - being honest and straightforward about my position.

But, obviously, you have every right to be as you are and wish to be. And that brings me to my question.

If you could, through whatever possibly-scientific means might be, become able to unambiguously identify with a particular gender, whether ""appropriate"" to your physical sex or not, by taking resource to such technology as might become possible - i.e., modification of gene expression and gene network regulation, hormone and glandular attenuation, etc.... 

In short, more X or Y related stuff going on, or different brain architecture, neurochemical balance, hormones, neurohormones, polyamines, neuropeptides, whatever it may be that could cause you to feel more like some particular gender as the normative, ahem, discourse considers it, **would you then prefer to be gender ambiguous or would you prefer to settle into a particular assignment without ambivalence?** Or some third unstated?

Hello everyone,

I'm not actually trans* myself (I'm cis-male - if somewhat non-binary; homosexual orientation), but I consider myself an ally of anyone that works hard on finding their identity in a world that is overly fond of labeling us. So, please bear with me, and excuses in advance if I don't speak the lingo. I'll learn quickly, though, and I'd be grateful to be pointed towards more appropriate forms of address if mine is considered inadequate.

My professional background is that of a librarian / anthropologist. Since I have studied shamanic cultures fairly extensively (although mostly Asian ones), I'm well aware of the concept of Two-Spirit people, and the general high regard they traditionally receive among their own people. I also suspect that this is (in North America) tied to their adherence to the medicine societies, since certain aspects of the sacred medicine can only be performed by Two-Spirit people.

What kind of challenges do Two-Spirit people encounter that have abandoned the traditional medicine of their people, and/or have decided to reject the ""box"" they are expected to live in? Although much more respectful than the traditional Anglo approach (ie, berdache), it's still labeling. This would be both in their spiritual life, and in the social ties among their own First Nations kin.

Likewise, I am interested in learning more of First Nations Two-Spirit people's challenges when dealing with the imposed Anglo red-tape when it comes to healthcare and other forms of bureaucracy.

Clarification: I'm specifically looking for Two-Spirit experiences that are fully presenting but not necessarily transitioning, since that was not a traditional thing to seek out.

Thank you all in advance.

Then on some weekends (or when I have some free time), I switch to feeling female, and sometimes it lasts maybe a day, an hour, or a whole weekend.

I never feel 100% male or female though. Like, right now I'm in ""female mode"" I guess you could call it, but I only feel 65 - 75% female, and some goes for when I'm in ""male mode"".

My first name is female, but I don't feel it's super feminine. I also have several academic papers published under that name so I'm a little attached to it. The shortened form though, for whatever reason, just doesn't feel right. Maybe 95% of people called me by that nickname, so I decided to post a ""name-change"" announcement on Facebook: 

&gt; IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT: I have thought long and hard about this, and I've decided that I will no longer be going by the nickname ""[common nickname of female first name]"". My feelings toward that name have ranged from neutral at best (""I've been called this all my life; I guess it's my name"") to outright hatred (most of you know how much I HATE HATE HATE being called ""[nickname] [last name]"").

&gt; I've been using the nickname ""Tig"" in various places over the past ten years and many people find it fitting and easy to remember once I say ""Tig, like short for tiger or Tigger"". When I get a Real Job™, I will be going by the more professional ""[first initial].[middle initial]."" in the workplace. If neither of these names sound like something you can remember to call me, ""[first name]"" is still my name. But ""[nickname]"" is not. Thanks everyone for your support :)

I didn't expect any backlash, especially since I left my full first name as an option, but I'm a little overwhelmed at the positive response to ""Tig"" as my name. Even my parents are going to start using it! For those who know my whole gender issues package (including my parents) it feels really validating as I assume they know what is up and how I'm moving towards more gender-neutral things, and for my friends and family who don't know yet it feels really good to see them making an effort, and correcting themselves when they call me by my old name, even if I don't realize it before they catch themselves. It gives me hope that they can be so accepting when I come out and possibly change pronouns.

2015-05-27 14:16:46,37gnc1,1,5,"Fair warning this probably sounds really silly and irrational.

I recently got out of a bad relationship that lasted for about 5 years. It was during that time(or shortly before, not sure) that I had decided on my chosen name. I liked my name, it was unique but simple and it fit me well. I had entertained the idea of assuming the name I used for an online avatar game(which is a real name, not like cosplaykid14 or anything(sorry if that's someone's handle LOL)) but it seemed too cheesy or unoriginal. 

Anyway, I used that name and built this relationship with it. One of the things the guy would say to me whenever I was questioning myself was ""you're just [name] and you'll always be [name] to me"" which was comforting... However, now that we've split up I'm feeling negatively towards that name. I've caught myself feeling uncomfortable telling people that's my name, or when my sister uses it, or just thinking about it. 

I don't really feel like what I'm called is all that significant, I've gone by many different usernames online and respond to all of them. I feel like changing my name wouldn't be that big of a deal. I know there's legality to consider, but I haven't changed my name legally yet so technically I could still choose something else. I've been drifting back to that avatar name, even though I don't really play that game anymore. I use it as my Skype name since I created it to talk with those people from the game, and I use my Skype a lot. I really do like the name, I feel it also fits me... 

Would it be strange to sort of test run a name? Meet new people and tell them this new name and see how I feel about it? The more I think about it the more I want to get away from the old name and go with this new one. Am I crazy? Should I just get over myself and stick with the name I chose?

One of the things the guy would say to me whenever I was questioning myself was ""you\'re just [name] and you\'ll always be [name] to me"" which was comforting... However, now that we\'ve split up I\'m feeling negatively towards that name. I\'ve caught myself feeling uncomfortable telling people that\'s my name, or when my sister uses it, or just thinking about it. \n\nI don\'t really feel like what I\'m called is all that significant, I\'ve gone by many different usernames online and respond to all of them. I feel like changing my name wouldn\'t be that big of a deal. I know there\'s legality to consider, but I haven\'t changed my name legally yet so technically I could still choose something else. I\'ve been drifting back to that avatar name, even though I don\'t really play that game anymore. I use it as my Skype name since I created it to talk with those people from the game, and I use my Skype a lot. I really do like the name, I feel it also fits me... \n\nWould it be strange to sort of test run a name? Meet new people and tell them this new name and see how I feel about it? The more I think about it the more I want to get away from the old name and go with this new one. Am I crazy? Should I just get over myself and stick with the name I chose? \n\nEdit: I should mention I don\'t use my chosen name for work or official things since I\'m not ""out"" and I haven\'t legally changed it, so my decision won\'t really affect my profession life.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Mixed feelings about my name...', 'created': 1432761406.0}"

2015-05-27 21:00:27,37iahw,3,6,"Hey r/genderqueer!

I’m coming out to my dad.
Well, I guess I’ve already come out to him, but he doesn’t quite “get” it.

Luckily, my father is pretty supportive of transgender people. There are quite a few trans women at his church and plenty of gay couples. My deceased mother, the previous minister, counseled plenty of gay &amp; transgender people. Their interim minister is a transman. Neither of my parents really conformed to gender roles. My dad loves “girly” things and my mom loved “manly” things. They were always pretty open about that, and supported me in my gender expression.

What my dad doesn’t get is my desire to transition and identify as not a woman. His excuse is that he knows plenty of women who are very masculine, and that there’s nothing wrong with that. He confuses gender identity with expression and socially constructed gender roles.

The problem is, my father is not really educated on the trans* spectrum. So I need your help.

**First, a little about me:**
AFAB. 25 years old. Transmasculine. 
Still definitely figuring this shit out.
I think I’m more on the “FTM” side of things - but right now i’m happy just to be somewhere in the middle. I like suits and skirts.
I don’t really care for the term “genderqueer” personally, as it conflates gender and sexual orientation in my mind. Androgyne and bi-gender don’t seem to fit either... Anyways, not having the language is certainly difficult. All I’ve really told him is “I don’t feel female... I’m not sure I’m a man, but I know I’m not a woman”.
His response? ""Well, Baylemtree, I don't really see you as a man"" *ouch*

**I need resources to help explain non-binary transgender identity** and why this is important to me for him to change his pronouns around me, and why I’m even doing this. I’m writing him a letter to explain my personal situation and tell him my story. I’m still working out a lot of this with a therapist &amp; my spouse (who is super supportive), and I’m a long way from coming out to the rest of my family, coworkers and friends. However, I want my dad to be informed enough to be a support as I discover more about myself. SO - I need your help in finding resources to help educate him.

He’s an incredibly intelligent and science-y guy though. No tumblr or “Everyday Feminist” articles will do. Ideally, peer-reviewed abstracts would be great, but I’ll settle for what I can get. I want something that explains non-binary gender identity succinctly as well as why non-binary trans people need to transition. He loves academic stuff, but he’s pretty critical of new wave &amp; the SJW brand of feminism (hence why tumblr will not do). 

**Here’s what I’ve compiled so far:**

2015-05-27 21:15:08,37icu1,7,10,"I'm afab, and I've never really questioned gender before, as I didn't mean anything to me at all. I was just me. I usually wore neutral clothes. Baggy pants and a loose t-shirt and hoodie. I didn't really realize gender was that important to people, until the last year of college, when I realized that people gave me so much more positive attention and seemed to want to be my friend, when I was wearing girly clothes. I've always had a hard time feeling included, so I jumped on the opportunity of being more of a girl, to feel like I was appreciated and included.

So anyway, I've been dressing girly the last couple of years, but lately I just haven't felt so good doing that. I've just had such a hard time liking myself. I was super close to falling back into an eating disorder again, because I felt so badly about who I am and how I feel like I'll never be good enough. I felt badly about my body, and compared myself to other girls and never really got what was the difference between us. We did the same things, more or less, but they seemed to feel happy about themselves, and I didn't. I just thought it was stress and pressure from work and school that pushed me into some kind of negative spiral, but now I'm not so sure. I used to love dresses and such, but lately eveytime I wore one I just wanted to take it off, because it doesn't feel comfortable anymore...

About a week ago I woke up and realized I don't know how it feels to be a woman. Not for real. And after two days of upset and confused feelings, and nonstop googling, I found the term Genderfluid, and thought ""WHOA!"". I ever only knew about female, male and 50-50 mix of the two. I told my boyfriend that I was having these thoughts, because I thought he should know why I was so distant and preoccupied. I didn't want him to think I was mad at him or anything like that. And afterwards I felt so relieved that I didn't know if I wanted to laugh or cry. So I did both. But after that the feelings have become so strong and weird!

Now I'm just really confused. 

Can i really be genderfluid, or is this just some weird idea that's popped into my head and will disappear soon? 
Is it reasonable to notice this at 22 yrs old? Shouldn't I have known all my life? 
It seems like most GQ people have always known that about themselves..
If it's not a phase, will this get easier over time, or will it always be like this??

I kind of hope It's just a phase, because I feel so shitty about everything. I have changed gender several times a day, and everytime I do I feel uncomfortable and somewhat sad, and I also regret my choice of outfit that day. And everytime I feel like a boy I want to cut my hair off, and wonder how I can conceal my boobs, and then I switch to girl and no longer want to do that stuff. This makes me so sad and confused?? 

Sorry for such a long post. I just don't know where to turn, because I don't know any queer people and I know my friends think these things are weird and that they get annoyed with queer people for making everybody adapt by using a new pronouns for them... So obviously I don't feel safe talking to any of them about what I feel now.

2015-05-28 05:31:40,37k4og,5,9,"**The Background**

I identify as bigender.  I'm AMAB and I feel male probably 95% of the time.  And I never feel somewhere in between.  Because I only feel femme maybe one day every month or so, I basically can't do anything for my female identity.  Anything that makes her more comfortable in her own body is exactly wrong the other 95% percent of the time, so net dysphoria goes up.

That means that what I *can* do for my female self mostly centers around clothing, tucking, and maybe some makeup.  Until recently, I lived with people I was not out to, so I had to keep things fairly hidden.

I recently started talking to a friend, a young adult transwoman who has basically resigned herself to never coming out of the closet or transitioning due to family situation and other factors.  She too, would have to hide anything she could have to make things better.

**The Idea**

I've heard about programs that provide care-packages or starter-kits to transpeople who are just coming out.  Things like breast forms and makeup kits and such.  My idea is to do something similar, but rather than targeting people who are about to transition, target people who can't.

Basically, I'm about to send this woman a kit of the things that helps my female side feel good about herself while staying stealth.  I'll list a bunch of examples below.  And now that I'm done making up the shopping list for the kit, I'm thinking ""What if I pooled and bought this stuff in bulk for group discounts?  We can't possibly be the only two people who feel they can't transition but still want to not hate their bodies.""  Because even if transition is your end-goal, you still want to be okay in the meantime.

My question to the group: can you respond in this thread (or in PM to me if you prefer to be more discreet) if you or someone you know might be part of that target audience?  Specifically, if you identify as one gender but have to actively hide that (from parents, roommates, friends, etc) and live as another gender.  And if you're in that demographic, would you mind mentioning items that are easy to hide but also ease your dysphoria or other issues?

-----
**The Kit**

What worked for me and I hope will work for her (and others), is a collection of things that allow me to dress when I'm alone, to a certain degree.  Some of these are things I'm sending and some are ideas I have about what to send next.

* *Panties* - You can wear them under boxers.  Nobody knows the difference, but you can have an anchor.  A feeling of having at least one correctly-gendered garment on you for the day.
* *Stockings* - I know that many ciswomen don't feel the need to remove leg hair, but when you look like me (not going to pass any time in my lifetime), every bit closer to traditional femininity helps.  It's easy for a male-presenting person to always wear shorts that go below the knee.  This means you can shave knee-and-up, and then opaque thigh-highs means you can have a nice visual appearance.
* *Medical Tape and/or NuBra* - I used medical tape.  I literally cried in relief the first time I saw cleavage that was my own real skin.  I hope that she (and others) can have that relief.
* *Gel Bra* - This one isn't specially concealable, but it made me feel much much better.
* *Gaff* - The internet seems convinced that the pantyhose-top construction for a gaff is the best.  So either one of those gaffs or the ingredients for them to assemble their own.
* *Bathrobe* - A big masculine bathrobe.  A really fast way to cover nearly all of your body if you are dressed and get interrupted.
* *Makeup* - Even a basic set, just something they can use to soften.
* *Double-Edge Razor* - The more of you that you shave, the more expensive that gets.  A double-edge seems quintessentially masculine, so it raises no suspicion.  But comparatively the blades are so cheap that you don't have to choose between getting suspiciously-many-refills and using dull blades.",genderqueer,Care Package Idea,1432816300.0,"{'created_utc': 1432791100, 'id': '37k4og', 'num_comments': 5, 'score': 9, 'selftext': '**The Background**\n\nI identify as bigender.

And I don't know if there's an option to search specifically or additionally for people who listed their identified gender as something other than just male or female.

EDIT: So appurrrently, OkCupid DOES let you search for people of more specific genders and sexualities than just male/female/everyone/straight/gay/bi. That is nice.

I was amab, and I would be including myself in the women search because I feel more feminine than masculine. I would be looking for men.

I'm an AFAB in the buckle of the bible belt. I identify as transgender/transmasculine. I am not out as of right now, but hope to start T &amp; come out soon...

this leaves me with a bit of a dilemma. I'm pretty active in the feminist community here, specifically the art community. I've been asked to be vice president of a statewide women's art organization. The founders are some of my close friends and mentors, and I have the leadership and institutional knowledge to lead this organization (I have a pretty cool job in the arts, that is well respected).

I love this organization and want to be a part of it. But... how can I be a part of it if I don't identify as female? I don't want to publicly be seen as leading a women's art organization, because I don't want to be identified as female to my social groups.

The easy answer is, of course, that I would come out as trans and resign from the group because my gender does not match that groups gender.

But... gender is also fluid. I'm not a woman, but I'm not strictly a man either. I still wear skirts, and probably can't be fully out due to my job. There have never been any trans*people in this group (as far as I know), and it could lead it to a larger discussion. The president and I have talked about opening FRINGE up to all genders for similar reasons.

Right now, this organization is a safe space for women artists, especially those with children &amp; non-art jobs. I feel like I'm co-opting their space as someone who doesn't identify as female.

Holy crap... is this male priviledge?

2015-05-30 16:29:22,37uw9x,4,11,"So I never really identified with having a gender as a child - I was socialised as female and did a lot of typically ""girly"" things but also had times of being really ""boyish"" - and I was a bit of an outsider, not quite one of the girls but not one of the boys either. But I always was treated as a girl, and fit the role a some ways, so I assumed that I was.

When puberty hit, I felt really uncomfortable with my chest - I didn't like the changes and I didn't like the way people treated me or the attention I would get from guys re: my chest. But then when I was still quite young (9/10-12), I experienced some prolonged shittiness which was quite traumatic and related to the ""femininity"" of my body.  I do feel that I would be in denial if I said that that hasn't affected the way I relate to myself. 

I was purposely underweight for a long time and always felt freer and more relaxed in my body at a lower weight - recently I've been making connections and wondering whether that was because it allowed me to look more androgynous. Gaining weight has changed my body a lot and it's been a really powerful experience in terms of reclaiming my body and being visible in society in a way which I was really afraid of. It's led me to question whether my discomfort was ever about weight, and I have realised that I am comfortable in my body at a healthier weight too especially when I can bind. Binding has been helpful and enlightening for me because I really like the way I feel when I bind, and I wake up looking forward to wearing my binder even just for an hour before I go to work (for various reasons, I can't bind at work). Taking it off gives me a feeling of more appreciation for my chest, in a way that I have the choice to bind and so it feels less like a burden - and when I take my binder off then I do feel affection toward my body but I think the affection toward it is because the curves I have remind me of strong women in my life and I appreciate the association of myself with these women and the relationships we have had, and I'm not so sure if it's really about connecting with my own body or with connecting with the feelings I have toward other women, and taking comfort in the sort of societal legacy we share in being read as female and addressing the world from that position. I don't know if that makes any sense?

Basically, I don't know that I feel that I have any gender - though I do have affection for the female gender and the women I relate to irl, and I am appreciative of the ways in which I am ""stereotypically female"" because it has emotional value in terms of how I understand myself and others, and how living in a female role has shaped my life. I'm left wondering, though, just because I like these things, does that mean they are a part of me? Or rather, just because I identify with some stereotypically ""female"" things, do I have to also accept them in that context, or can these things (e.g. my body language, or taking on nurturing roles) be some part of a gender that isn't female? (I think they can. But does that mean that in this case they are separate from my understanding of my gender? Is any of this making sense or in anyway relatable?)

I'm trying to write this all before I go to work so sorry that it's very rambling and probably jumping around. I just feel stressed that I've got all these questions going around my head and no-one that I can feel quite safe enough to ask these things irl. I don't know what qualifies as experiencing oneself as non-binary and while it's a label that I like and that (I think?) I can relate to, I don't want to appropriate others' experiences if I'm projecting my normal ""binary female"" experience onto a label which actually means something a lot more to others. As in, how do I understand what dysphoria is and whether my experience counts as dysphoria? How can I differentiate between being someone who just doesn't identify with gender roles, and someone who is actually gender queer? I know that gender roles and gender identity are two different things, but I don't know how to connect with my gender identity, I don't know how to get a sense of it. I don't feel that there's anything there that's solid enough to go by or to connect to, and that isn't just an experience that's relative to my surroundings and the way I relate to others and the way others relate to me. (as in, people read me as female, so I act female, but am I really female or am I just used to being read as such and I've never looked at/connected with my own experience enough before to have questioned it so it's never seemed strange to me?)
