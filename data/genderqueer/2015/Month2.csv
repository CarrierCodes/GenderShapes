22 y/o female here.

I've been questioning both my sexuality and gender identity for a while. I'd say I'm much more attracted to men, but not quite hetero. I don't think I'd actually date another woman though.

But I haven't dated in general since early high school due to PTSD and social anxiety that stems from it. Like I can't leave my house alone, and I haven't had ANY friends since I dropped out of school at 16. Absolutely no calls, text, visits, nothing, for like 5-6 years now. I stopped seeing my therapist (for anxiety) because of anxiety too.

So... it's unlikely I will spend my life with ANYBODY, let alone another lady I'd like. So I don't think it's necessary I tell my family I'm bi. But... should I, anyway? They are open-minded and liberal, so they'd accept it. But I don't want their opinion of me to change.

And about being genderqueer: do everyday cis people even really understand it? I don't even understand it within myself, but I know I'm non-binary. In my past relationships I felt like a woman, I liked the female role in the relationship and in sex. But I have dreams of being male. I've always wished I'd been born one instead (though I wouldn't transition -- it's just a ""what if"".) Whenever I think about sex it's generally from the point of view from the male. Even male/male scenarios sometimes. It's like I have half a man's brain.

Since I was a teenager I've had hormone problems, it gives me facial hair and irregular cycles. Not sure if that is possibly influencing my brain chemistry, or if something messed up somewhere... Or if I've always been both... Docs couldn't find what was wrong.

2015-02-01 12:51:02,2ueiwg,13,11,"Hello everyone, So I wasn't sure where I should ask this &amp; I thought maybe this would be the best place.

So lately I've been in a sort of a pickle, some youtube peeps that I've watch for years ( Gigi gorgeous for example ) have came out as transgender. I know Gigi came out a while back &amp; her transition is going fabulously. but my problem is a question that made me wonder where my path was heading. The people that I adore to watch started off as slowly becoming more feminine. more androgynous. Everything about them just screamed girl each step forward. So, I felt as if I was heading down that same path.

What if I was transgender &amp; I just didn't know it or ignored it? Yes I've imagined being a girl &amp; if I was given the option at birth I would choose it. But I came to the conclusion that I don't think I am transgender, maybe 70% female. But not all there. I don't know what that's called or how to express that tho. All I know is I just feel  fine as how I am and being different is what I like. The thought that I might be something &amp; I just didn't know it scared me a lil. Because I fear wasting time being unhappy &amp; not fully satisfied.

So anyways, I asked myself, if don't want to transition &amp; I don't mind being a boy. Why am I still a little unhappy? I realized I just didn't like my masculine features, I don't have any chest or back hair ( I'm 18 btw ) &amp; the thought of growing hair there in a few years scares me. I was wondering if there is a way in HTR that can allow me to look &amp; feel a little more feminine? Softer skin, less hair, lil feminine  body adjustments. Is there a way to gain this without fully transitioning? Like a good balance? I don't want boobs &amp; very much like being androgynous.

I just want to feel less manly yah know? I just don't know where to start. Sorry for the whole back story. I really appreciate your time &amp; thank you!! &lt;3

Also I'd like to know for future use if there is anything I can do to better support nonbinary people and help be affirming to them? Obviously I use pronouns as requested, but I'd love to know any way I can support my NB community better.

2015-02-01 21:25:25,2ug2cl,4,11,"OK! ~~This won't be a long story~~, but I wanted somewhere to at least write this down. I'm in a super great mood, and I feel RIGHT for once. It's new for me, as I'm sure for a lot of us starting out.

Last night, after lying in bed restless for an hour, thinking about transness, I made that kind of decision where you never formed all the constituent parts in your brain beforehand, but you act quickly as though you know exactly what you want to do. I looked up ""gender therapy"" and found this helpful page of info and resources. (http://www.hemingways.org/GIDinfo/therapy.htm if anyone is looking for an international list of gender therapy providers)

I found a doctor fifteen minutes away! I thought I'd have to drive an hour and a half away. This bolstered my confidence a ton. And doing this simple research, and not being so afraid all the goddamn time, helped me formulate clear thoughts and ideas of what I wanted. I even suddenly remembered long-ago memories of wishing to god (and after I stopped believing at a very early age, the need for wishes still persisted - so I literally asked my ceiling every night haha). I remember wearing towels like a skirt, and how HAPPY I was. I didn't know I was imagining being a ""girl"" I never had a chance to conceptualize it. So, I internalized every nasty bit of rhetoric and idea behind queerness, and transness, and... went many many years of my life being utterly contemptuous of my surroundings.

ANYWAYS, a year ago I ""came out"" as trans, then kinda recoiled, then the feeling came back vengefully. This was last night. There isn't a shred of doubt anymore. So, I initiated the second such conversation with my mother this morning. She was absolutely accepting, asked to be in therapy with me (to which I said maybe... but I do want her there at some point) and asked about my sexuality, because I've only dated men. I'm ace, but she has no distinction between romance and sexual attraction - the latter which doesn't dictate my relationships. She has no idea what to expect in the next few years, and neither do I. She really wants me to be happy, and I could tell she was putting the pieces together in her head for the first time. The first time I told her about all this amid a breakdown, of course, and so she took me less seriously. When we were talking, it's like suddenly we had an answer to my behavior and periphery problems (depression, general anxiety, developing agoraphobia).

Ok, I think that's plenty off my chest. Thank you for reading and thanks to the community for facilitating this sort of sharing. Without it and spaces like it, I wouldn't have known any of this.

SO GRATEFUL to all the trans queens out there. You are my inspiration. You keep me alive. Stay fabulous and beautiful. SPECIAL THANKS to Laverne Cox what a wonderful wonderful human being.

2 months ago, I was fine being male and had no problem with it. I think girls are really pretty, most of the time when I see one I think that they look pretty/beautiful, this confused me because I thought I was gay. 

After looking at them, sometimes id think ""I wish I could be pretty"". This is what started my questioning, when I think about my confusion, my heart beats faster and sometimes I feel a stomach ache. 

tbh I don't think I want to be a girl, it does seem appealing at times, and the masculine parts of me don't bother me (I think), I have hair on my body and it doesn't bother me really it just sometimes looks... odd

I think I'm fine with how my body is, even tho I have some extra weight. I don't really like facial hair tho, well only the prickliness after shaving is what bothers me.

I think I'm fine with my penis, I'm a but conscious about the size and it can feel uncomfortable and annoying at times.

I'm not like most guys in terms of how I act and what I do, I'm not a typical ""bro"" and I'm a little flamboyant. I'm terms of personality, I'm definitely in the middle of masculine and feminine.

Hi, I'm DMAB, just turned 18 last month. I've had depression and anxiety for about 6ish years (idk might as well throw that in if it's important). Also please forgive me if I use some terms or say things wrong because I am new to all of this. For the last few months I've felt really... off? I realized a bit before reading/watching an anime/manga Hourou Musuko (which I really recommend) and reading/watching it helped me sort of figure out that most of the time (70%?) I feel ""male"", 10% I feel somewhere in the middle (but very confused), and then the other 20% definitely more ""female"". But I don't know if the ""male"" is just how I usually feel, not necessarily ""male"".

I'm just confused.

I am not necessarily upset with my current body, but I'm pretty hairy and have a strong jawline, so that's kind of ehh. I don't mind my genitals or whatnot. But sometimes I wish I could wear cute clothes (I'm really jealous of the options girls have for clothes), and I wish I could present as female and be female sometimes. I don't know.

I understand that I can be one or the other or both or neither. And I know I don't have to have a definitive answer to it.

I've only come out to two people (both of whom I only met like two weeks ago but they are both really cool and one is non-binary, so that help with making me feel more comfortable with telling them).

I feel like... how I currently am, presenting as male, I'm just okay with it. There are times when I know I would feel better as a girl and want to be a girl, but almost never I'm like ""YEAH LETS BE A DUDE"". I'm just okay with being born ""male"".

So what do you think? Are you interested in making art for or receiving art from other folks on r/genderqueer as a part of our support network? Also, would any of you like to be drawn? I can't promise brilliance or a short timeline, but I'm getting back into art and would love to dedicate some time to drawing the wonderful folks in my community.

As I've said to a couple folks in this thread, if you want to be drawn, just let me know which picture(s) I should use as reference, and what kind of style/clothing you prefer. PM me if you would rather not share that info here. We are a diverse community and I would love to draw all of you!

2015-02-05 23:00:13,2ux8km,0,1,"Wagwan friends, I hope this is allowed here. Over the past couple of months I've been combing the web for studies, sources and articles on LGBT+ phenomena for a new reddit project, but I need your help!

My project is focused on education and information, it will be a sub which focuses on the study of LGBT+ phenomena on a scientific level, broken down into the relevant categories, and hopefully if all goes to plan, it will grow to become the single best one-stop-shop for LGBT+ education and information in the world. 


I believe every person, LGBT+ or otherwise, deserves access to quality, unbiased information on LGBT+ phenomena and things like HIV from an LGBT+ perspective. I believe governments and schools around the world are drastically failing the people with this and much more can be done. I believe until people have a real education and understanding of LGBT+ phenomena, true equality will always be a pipe dream. I believe this is the next step for LGBT+ people and is massively over due.


I believe knowledge is power and I believe in empowerment through education. I believe the studies and sources scattered around the internet need to be collectivised into a one-stop-shop to provide a coherent consensus and curriculum for LGBT+ or non-LGBT+ persons to access and gain the education denied to them in schools, libraries and elsewhere. I believe the format of reddit subreddits are perfectly suited for collectivising and organising the material. 

I am asking everyone in the community to come together and share any studies, sources, articles and any other resources you can think of which have helped you personally, elevated your understanding in some way or otherwise stuck in your mind. 


I'm sure you'll agree awareness and understanding in the general public isn't as good as it could be, so I need your help to provide the best studies, sources, articles and other resources on non-binary, gender queer and gender fluidity for my project! 


I'm hoping everyone can come together and chip in their piece, and together we can build the biggest and best database of LGBT+ information in the world! Which everyone can benefit from and enjoy. 


 In doing so I want to provide a trapdoor for those who live in repressive regimes in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Russia, South America  and elsewhere to get access to the quality education and information they are entitled to and deserve. 

I doing so I want to deliver the smoking gun to myths, ignorance and prejudice in the form of an easily accessible database of facts and legitimate studies and sources which can be used in debate to prove or disprove something outright. I want this to be a community project which belongs to the community. The sub is for the whole world, everyone is a share holder.


The sub will be dedicated to strict quality control. I want it to have a reputation for being unbiased, no-nonsense, politically neutral and trust worthy when it comes to accessing quality, valid studies, sources and articles from legitimate bodies and websites. 

Subsequently, I am also looking for expert users to mod this sub; people who study genetics, biology, neuroscience, evolutionary psychology, and similar relevant fields. 


I am looking for homosexual, bisexual, transgender, gender queer, asexual and intersex users who are experts in their chosen field in order to ensure strict quality control and have one or two of each mod the sub respectively, and I need the mods to have the expertise to be able to comb through everything we have collected and flag the dodgy or outdated material to ensure strict quality control. 

You don't need to be an expert or student of such STEM fields; people who are learned in psychology, sociology, psychiatry and counselling as well as political activism are also needed. Sexual health experts are also wanted. If you think you know your stuff about anything like this please don't hesitate to apply. Students are welcome, you don't need to be fully qualified. 

I simply do not have the expertise or the qualifications to ensure quality control myself, and I know there are a few users here who know their stuff about such things. I really hope they come forward and volunteer to mod my new project because without expert users to ensure quality material my sub simply won't work. If you would like to mod, please PM me or email with a few paragraphs about yourself and I will contact you once the sub is up and running. 


I want everything. Give me everything. Don't worry if you're not sure if it's trust worthy or legitimate because we can sort that out later. Just give me everything, please! 

You can share them here or if you can email them to me at LGBTeducationproject@outlook.com 

Please tell your friends and get their suggestions also! 

Please note; my laptop is still busted until the end of the month, so I am allowing a period of one month or so for users to submit material before I start to build the sub. 


Once the sub is up and running and the mods chosen, the mods will then comb through the material and remove anything that isn't sufficiently valid. 


Once mods have cross referenced and the material archived into the relevant category, the sub will then be open to the public to read and share. Once the basic foundation has been laid, the sub will then be dedicated to hosting new studies or sources as they are released. I want it to be *the* go to place to find the latest developments in study of all LGBT+ phenomena. 


My vision is a digital library of quality, informative and interesting material people can browse through for hours on end. My vision is a one stop shop for a quality education on LGBT+ phenomena which will undercut repressive regimes and transform the quality of LGBT+ debate online. My vision is whenever someone comes out, the first thing people think of is ""you have to check out this sub!"". 

My vision is a sub which catapults education and understanding of LGBT* phenomena and lasts, hosting new studies and sources as they are released. Please help me make my vision a reality. I can't do it without your help! 


There will also be a section for asylum seekers and kids sent to conversion camps or conversion therapy and other similar things. Like I said everyone is a share holder and this is a community project and everyone's input is welcome and needed 


Oh and I also need names for the sub. Please suggest names! Any other suggestions for how the sub will work and what it could be about are also very welcome. 

Please note I will also cross post this to other LGBT subs. 

email: LGBTeducationproject@outlook.com   

You have the rest of February to submit material here or via email and apply for modship before we begin. If you would like to get involved in any way, please do as all are welcome and the more the merrier.

ANYWAYS, I have been dating my girlfriend for around two years now and we plan on staying together for the long run. Quite recently she (whom from this point on I will use gender neutral pronouns with) has come out as non-binary. They don't identify as a man, but just don't fully identify as a woman either. I completely support their decision, but I certainly was surprised on hearing about this. This doesn't affect how we feel about each other, at least I don't think so, it's just something I wasn't completely prepared for.

The way they describe it, they identify mostly with feminine traits, but also feel partly androgynous (no gender, although I'm not sure exactly what that means). They are also considering about potentially getting a chest binder for days where they feel androgynous. I am a cisgender male who until very recently was not aware of gender issues outside of being male and identifying as a woman or vice versa, so this mix of somewhere in the middle is all really new to me. They are straight and have no attachment to women, it's just the gender issue.

I searched this subreddit (and others) for a similar situation and drew a total blank. I'm wondering if anyone has had (or knows about) a similar experience and can share their story.

Quite recently she (whom from this point on I will use gender neutral pronouns with) has come out as non-binary. They don't identify as a man, but just don't fully identify as a woman either. I completely support their decision, but I certainly was surprised on hearing about this. This doesn't affect how we feel about each other, at least I don't think so, it's just something I wasn't completely prepared for.\n\nThe way they describe it, they identify mostly with feminine traits, but also feel partly androgynous (no gender, although I'm not sure exactly what that means). They are also considering about potentially getting a chest binder for days where they feel androgynous. I am a cisgender male who until very recently was not aware of gender issues outside of being male and identifying as a woman or vice versa, so this mix of somewhere in the middle is all really new to me. They are straight and have no attachment to women, it's just the gender issue.\n\nI searched this subreddit (and others) for a similar situation and drew a total blank.

2015-02-09 00:25:01,2v8vpk,5,9,"Hello all! 

Recently I've been thinking about the term genderqueer, and whether it could apply to me (now or in the future). 

Basically, I experience the tension of not really believing that anyone is ""male,"" ""female,"" or ""straight."" I recently attended a men's group and had a horrifying experience, as their entire structure of masculinity was based on their theory of complementarity with their idea of women. I won't go into detail, but it was bad. 

I know that's not all masculinity can be, but I'm not sure how I'd define it at all. Or femininity for that matter. 

At the same time, I have certainly internalized my masculine status and am aware of it every day. In particular, my internalized misogyny sometimes comes out when I am frustrated (usually with objects when I am alone). So I know that there is a lot of ""guy shit"" inside me, which is set up as opposed to the sense of femininity I have internalized. 

There's a lot more to say, but I don't want to go on and on. 

TL;DR does anyone else feel a tension between knowing they've internalized their assigned gender while intellectually and emotionally yearning to escape its confines? 

As an addendum, I have a hard time thinking of masculinity as anything but negative.

So I came out as transgender to my conservative yet very open-minded cis GF last week.  We talked about it and decided that we both want to stay together because we love each other.

Basically I'm wondering if this for me is similar to the the ""buy [bi] now gay later"" adage in aspect to gender.  It's very hard for me to not think of it in that way.  She wants to know now upfront whether I see myself as m2f because that's a different set of goalposts which will be more difficult for her (accepting a public life as a lesbian couple with children)

The big thing is that she is interested in having a family and while I am as well, it's not the same burning feeling in me as it is in her.  I cannot decide if she is convincing me that I'm not fully m2f because that way it's easier to stay together or not.  It's kind of nervewracking.  We have both acknowledged that at this point (5 months HRT 0.5 weeks being out) it's difficult to know.

Truth is I have no idea what I am at this point either really.  All I know is that I wanted to start medical transition so I did and I feel a lot better.

2015-02-11 11:19:58,2viy4e,14,21,"FIRST OF ALL apologies in advanced, I am new to gender (and sexuality) as non-binary, and I am also new to posting on Reddit in general. Please be patient with me, gentle critiques are appreciated. If this is the wrong sub, please point me to the right one.

SECOND OF ALL she is still in the process of picking a pronoun she feels comfortable with, so in this post I will try to just use the neutral “they” “them” etc.

My SO of 1 ½ years came out as genderqueer to me almost exactly one month ago. Due to a home life and past relationships that tried (and still try) to force them into a classic female role, they have never felt secure enough to really own and explore their own identity, I am the first (and so far the only) one they have come out to in person.

They explained to me that they never felt strictly “female” even from when they were a child, but rather changed from “male” to “female to “neither” at different times (unknown for how long or how often). There wasn’t really much else they could explain, besides the assurance that they said that they were attracted to me sexually, and that they didn’t mind my attraction to their female form.
I am a cisgender male who is new to the concept of non-binary genders, but I have no problem with it and I told them so.

Since then, our relationship has continued to develop. We laugh, talk, and get along just fine, I love them very much and we are hoping to make this last a lifetime.

However, how we interact physically has drastically changed since they came out to me. Before, we were taking it very slow, but steadily moved forward. I knew that in past relationships they had been sexually manipulated (possibly abused, I have not pressed the subject) so I wanted to make sure they were going at a pace they felt comfortable at, even at this point we had never had sex.
 But since they came out to me, we seem to be going backwards. Physical touch is rare, and barely beyond the platonic (holding hands, limbs brushing together occasionally). Intimacy is nearly non-existent, as they seem to be developing repulsion to it. The few times we have been intimate, they would show signs of discomfort – sometimes even pain, but never mention it, leaving me feeling stressed and worried that I’m hurting them and draining any joy we used to get out of intimacy.

Attempts to talk about it are quickly shot down or the subject changed.

I am confused and hurt by this, I don’t know what’s going on, but first and foremost I want to support them as they explore their identity. Can anyone clue me into what they may be experiencing? Are we dealing with physical dysphoria? Can they be developing different sexual preferences? What can I do to better understand and support them?

tl;dr: I want to support my newly genderqueer SO while dealing with the fear that they are losing interest in me.

2015-02-11 17:44:23,2vk1gc,5,4,"I (26GQ) been trying to figure out how to come out to my husband (26M) in a way that will minimize hurt feelings all around, and I am drawing a blank. I guess I just need to vent and get this off my chest more than anything.

I'm afab and genderqueer with a bit of fluidity in my presentation. I feel like my identity is more or less stable--not a woman, not a man, maybe leaning slightly feminine--but how I like to appear to other people fluctuates. I definitely have some days where I want to be as androgynous as possible, other days I want to wear all the makeup and try on all the dresses, and days where I am miserable that my body won't let me appear as masculine as I want to be.

When I met my now-husband at 19, I'd put myself in the female box by default (despite never really feeling like a woman at all), so female is how he's always perceived me. But two years ago, I started exploring the whole nonbinary business on my own, and started finally figuring myself out. I've slowly started experimenting with new things, finding out what I like and don't like.

Experimenting with my appearance has gone well so far--he's not precisely supportive, but he hasn't objected to me binding or cutting my hair. He's been less cooperative about word choice. I'm not picky about pronouns, but I dislike being described as ""womanly,"" ""feminine,"" or anything of the sort. Several times I've told him that these sorts of words make me feel uncomfortable, and his response has been a hurt ""but I love you and I love the way your body is shaped,"" or ""but there's nothing wrong with being feminine--are you sure you aren't being misogynistic?"" Then he'll stop using those descriptors for a few weeks before they seep back in and we have to have the whole conversation over again--it's infuriating.

I don't think he's deliberately trying to make me feel uncomfortable or invalidated, but rather that he thinks that there's nothing wrong with being a woman, therefore I should feel fine being described as one, like it's some kind of internalized misogyny thing that I have to get over. It's like he can't grasp the idea that being a woman is fine, but I am not one, even if I have breasts. I think he expects me to change my definition of ""woman"" rather than he change his definition of me.

To add to the pile of things to talk about, I am becoming more and more certain that I want to start a low dose of T and get a breast reduction to make my body more androgynous, and I know that if I were single, I would probably have started T months ago. I have an exaggeratedly feminine body--30G breasts, hourglass waist, huge child-bearing hips--the whole bit. While I haven't brought up the topic of HRT with my husband, I have been progressively more vocal about my dislike of my breasts; the response is always something to the tune of ""your breasts are a beautiful part of you and I love them."" Sigh.

It's becoming more clear to me as I write this that he perceives my whole gender-questioning process as a phase that I'll outgrow, like I'm some kind of flighty child. Or at least that he's forcing himself to believe that, because the alternative is that it isn't a phase, and that I'm not the same as the image of me he's crystallized in his mind, and that I might want to behave outside of the role he's imagined me into, or modify my body in ways that detract even the tiniest bit from its perceived perfection (he was also quite opposed to me getting a second set of ear piercings, for fuckssake). If I push too hard, he'll rail on how I disregard his feelings and don't care about the relationship, but if I don't push hard enough, he'll never accept that I'm a -person- who has my own desires and values that don't necessarily align with his. Agh, I just don't know what to do about this.

He is literally the only one that I really want to understand and accept this. I don't need everyone to call me by a new name or new pronouns, I don't care if my coworkers think I'm male or female, I don't care if my parents wonder why my voice is deeper. I do care that my husband stops seeing me as something I'm not, and comes to terms with who I am, and hopefully continues to love the person I am even if my body isn't as close to his ideal.

I've got an online survey that needs responses, and if you ID as anywhere outside of the gender binary and you've ever wanted to rant or rave about your health care experiences, this is your time to shine!

IN PARTICULAR, given the responses I've gotten so far, I really need responses from nonbinary people who are:
-people of color
-designated male at birth (DMAB)
-over age 25

The survey is an online, mostly open-ended/qualitative survey, so most of the questions allow you to type as much as you want. Think of it as an online, typed interview.

What do you get out of doing this? Primarily, the chance to ultimately share your experience in the healthcare system with healthcare providers, policymakers and researchers, and hopefully affect the way that they think about the gender binary in healthcare. Secondarily, you get my undying love for helping me finish my thesis. Also, you have the chance to enter a lottery to win one of 2 $50 giftcards to amazon.com (I really wish that I could pay everyone who took the survey, but unfortunately I don't have the funding for that).

Who can take the survey? Anyone who is 18 or over, a US resident, and identifies as somehow outside of the man/woman binary. Again, I particularly need respondents who are people of color and/or designated male at birth and/or over age 25.

Here is the survey link, feel free to share it far and wide! https://yalesurvey.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_en58ujewB485VKB Thank you all so much!

Live at home with my parents and am pretty much a failure - but hope to graduate from college this May.

I've pretty much IDed as ace since I had an ID (2007 or 2008), and then when I actually had a bit of a sex drive I got confused about that. I'm still super confused about that, so that's fun. Interest waxes and wanes in getting off. I dated one guy once in 2009. I'm not really sure why but I did the flustery fluttery thing and there was never real sex 'cause I was young and insecure and not ready and such. A few years after that I realized I was probably arom as well (and started questioning whether I was realy ace). 

During late 2013 and 2014 I explore my sexuality - not who I'm interested in, just stopping repressing it horrifically. Find out I do like vaginal penetration, amongst other things. Some kinky exploration - but still too scared to do that with people. End up masturbating for/with friends online once or twice. Only because flustered about friend. Not sure what feelings are. Flustered confusion about two friends continue to date. Every couple of weeks grumbled demands for living together and threesome orgies. Not sure if joke or serious. Probably would bury face and hide if actually confronted about this. Do bury face and hide when friends tease, including friends other than those two. Easy to fluster. 

Late December 2014 to early January 2015, I figured that maybe I was more accurately demiromantic and demisexual and for about an evening that satisfied me - uuuuntil I just realized ""wait FUCK THAT'S STILL NOT ANSWERING THE WHO, JUST THE WHEN"". So I started calling myself a demisquared because lol, two demis, and gave up on figuring out romantic/sexual orientation (again). 

Fast forward to February 2015: I start wondering if I'm even comfortable considering myself female. Do I even have a gender? I stop using gendered pronouns if I can help it. It's odd, but kinda nice to avoid it, I guess. Doesn't solve issues, but doesn't cause more. Got my hair cut to do spiky short hairs, but don't bother putting product in it, and ended up loving the androgynous look it gave me after a little growing in (it was Beiber-y at first). 

I've always been fairly tomboyish and not overly feminine - and I know that's not part of gender identity since gender roles, etc. - but I've never been particularly taken with boobs, since they're inconvenient (take them please), and I've always wondered what it would be like to have a dick. I'm not really dysphoric other than not liking boobs 'cause they're inconvenient as hell, and kinda wanting a dick 'cause convenience. I don't like... hate myself for what my body is. I don't hate having a vagina (though I hate the word). 

On a whim and because it was pretty (we will not discuss why I am not going to make myself look even crazier at first post) I bought a packer. I do enjoy having it. Not entirely sure if I'll ever be comfortable wearing it outside my room. It is pretty and comforting though. 

I don't exactly know if I have a gender. I don't know if it changes day to day. I don't know how I feel about aforementioned two friends: I get all fluttery and confused if I think about it too long. Not sure if possessive-platonic-would-not-mind-sex or there's something more or what. Aforementioned friends are female. Do not think this matters?

Trying to figure this out...feel like I am getting closer to some answers but the more I dig the more complicated things seem to get. 

I struggle a lot with internal identity. *A lot*.

I feel like the interface through which I process the world, the internal observer, doesnt have a gender. It's just me. I always thought I was male because of the parts, and I didnt believe that my desire to be a girl was any more than fetish. Now that I accept it's much more, I fear that I am not a girl. That I am really male. 

Why does this bother me? I dont know. I just know I dont want it. I feel like there is something truly female about my *flow*, and it's the way I want to lock in to this world and relationships with others. If I had the choice, I would have been born cis female.

But the identity feels like it comes and goes. When it's on I feel feminine and care free and happy. I love it, it's where I truly feel whole and like everything has meaning. When it's gone is when I feel like I am just a delusional male.

Cut to last night, where on valentines day I put on stockings for my girlfriend (I like being and feeling pretty). But my mood changes and suddenly the observer inside is telling me that I am pathetic, a sad ugly man trying to be a girl. 

These states are hard to deal with. In them there is no solution. I do not want to be a male in these states, I dont get relief by letting myself lapse into a male identity. My feminine voice begins to feel fake, and the observer tells me I am a fraud. My voice goes back to what is comfortable (doesnt require effort) and then I experience dysphoria from using the male voice.

In some ways, ways I dont understand, I feel like I am non-binary. Like Alyssa sits right on the outside of the female boundary, almost there but not. Sadly looking in on the inside and feeling like if she had been born inside that binary, these doubts wouldnt be here.

I am working with a therapist and hoping I can find peace. I am on hormones now for 4 months, and I like estrogen. I like that my body is becoming more feminine, and I like when I can feel emotion and sometimes I feel like a real girl and it makes me so happy.

What does this sound like? A trans identity and struggle aggravated by anxiety/depression swings, or a non-binary identity I am trying to run from? Or does it just sound like the mental struggle of being transgender?

However I don't think it is possible to be BORN as both genders.

I believe the people who say they are genderfluid are actually simply transgender. NOBODY wants to be transgender. Saying you are genderfluid is empowering and can make a transgender person feel better and more in control. Also being genderfluid is ""fun"" for some.

The people that have problems with their bodies and yet say they are gender fluid? I think they are just transgender in denial.

In order to be BORN as both genders, you would need two brains for that, which isn't possible.

There is no evidence of such a thing.

Lack of evidence doesn't mean proof of existence.

Otherwise, ""otherkin"" (like mentioned below) and any other idea would be considered real no matter what, because there is nothing that disproves it.

The brain develops with a set sex of male or female in the womb. The brains of males and females are physically different. This is an undeniable fact.

For ""genderfluid"" to be real, brain would need to go through a constant biological metamorphosis between male and female during the entire life of a person. This can not (and would not) happen once the brain has developed. Otherwise transgender people, MTF and FTM, would NOT exist. The basis of transgender concept is that gender can not be changed no matter what once the brain developed in the womb.

For ""non-binary"" to be real, there would need to exist another sex hormone that isn't estrogen nor testosterone. Emphasis in ""sex hormone"" medical term. This 3rd sexual hormone does not exist.

There is no 3rd sex hormone and its impossible for brain to constantly metamorphose once developed. Ergo, 1 brain sex that doesn't change.

The brain sex can only be physically male or female (there are no other choice outside of the estrogen and testosterone).

There is no 3rd option, not even for intersex people. Not even for transpeople. The sex hormones do not create a ""brain that constantly changes physically"" in neither case.

There is no precedent, evidence, antecedent of anything like a 3rd brain that is not male or female. (And no, an internet blog with the ""experiences"" of a teenager doesn't count).

Detractors may be skeptical, it may sound mean, it may make some internet blogs angry, but its a fact and shouldn't be hidden. That would only spread misinformation.

There is no fact or study that proves ""non-binary brain"" or ""genderfluid brain"" are real, its just suppositions and speculation.

Science has proven differences between male and female brain, but not the existence of other kind of brains.

About 4-5 months ago I started questioning my gender, and every passing day seems to make everything that comes with being assigned female more uncomfortable and stressful for me, not because I am ashamed with it or uncomfortable with my body but because I'm beginning to realize how drastically my biological sex affects my life and how I can't control that. It's fucking scary. I'm a confident person with skyscraper levels of self-esteem, and I have never had anything negative except stress/discomfort with being perceived as female come with my gender. But right now I'm so agitated with the assumptions that my head hurts. Why do people think they know what I like, who I'm attracted to, what I want to wear, or what I want to be called? Because they think they know what genitals I have? It doesn't make sense! How did we start this? What's the logic there? 

So, like most any nonbinary or trans person, I've had my fair share of mean people, bigots, or just people who are unaware that gender isn't two boxes. I thought I had brushed all those experiences off, as I've almost always been able to be myself regardless; now they're all replaying in my head. That I'm perceived as female isn't necessarily what's driving me crazy. It's the notion that my sexual organs really have such an impact on how I'm treated, the choices I make and the choices I'm allowed to make, where I go, what I do, the social situations I'm placed into and how I am expected to act in them, and the fact that if I simply reject all of this like I'd like to, I won't be taken seriously and/or the assumptions would still be there. I'm scared that I won't be able to deal with them anymore. I've gotten pretty good at it, but I don't know if I'll be able to handle much more. For example, I have a haircut tomorrow. My mother is going to take me to a women's hair salon, basically throw my biological sex in the hairdresser's face with my assigned name and the wrong pronouns (or at least that's how it feels), and probably hawk over it to ensure that the haircut isn't ""too dykey"". (&lt; actual quote) I want to join the Air Force. That's a lot of distinctly female treatment. The military isn't going to try to use gender neutral pronouns; that's a losing battle, at least for the next generation. I think Air Force formal uniforms require females to wear tights and skirts. Right now I feel like that would make me burst into tears. I'm so damn sensitive. I don't know what I would do. I'm starting to question whether I am making up all of this stress in my mind in a subconscious attempt to be special. Maybe if I force myself back into it, femininity will stop being so uncomfortable? I don't know. At one point I was fine with just being a tomboy, but now it's an emotional bomb I don't know how to deal with. Part of me wants this to be a phase so I can just be fine with being a girl. Is it wrong to feel that way? I have prided myself on self-respect; that thought just feels gross.

I'm going to cut this short before it becomes a novel. Writing this has helped me calm down. I'm pretty okay now. I'm not even sure if the above ramblings make any sense. I could just really use some words of wisdom on this stress and coping with the lack of control. If anyone has similar experiences to share, that would help a lot (novels welcome!).

2015-02-18 12:09:33,2wayw9,7,6,"I've been going through a huge identity crisis, and I have no idea who I am. It all started some months back when I fell into a deep depression, which I'll talk about later. 

A little about me: (sorry some of it is TMI)

I am a 22 year old male. After the past few months, I am pretty sure I am asexual, or some form thereof. 

When I was a kid, I always felt different from other guys. I was always more feminine than they were. I considered myself girly, but not a girl. I never thought I was a girl, I just thought that I wasn't as masculine as others. For a long time, I never connected with my gender. I didn't want to be a girl or think I was a girl, I just didn't quite fit in. So I didn't identify as being a guy. I always thought my being sensitive, small, and not liking sports made me not worthy of calling myself a guy. That

When I got to college, I really started identifying as a man. I started realizing that I could develop my own sense of masculinity. In my sense of masculinity, a man isn't the usual macho, insensitive, and aggressive person that society makes him out to be. Rather, a man is sensitive, loving, stands up for what he believes, loyal, etc. In addition, I thought that a man had both ""masculine"" and ""feminine"" characteristics. So I lived by that, and felt pretty happy when I was able to dress and act like the man that I thought represented masculinity.

I entered a depression last semester. To summarize, a girl I had once liked said some really awful things to me and told me that a real man doesn't wear nice clothes or act gentlemanly to everyone or cook (all things that I do/like to do). Combined with other circumstances in my life, I feel into a depression. After that, I started questioning my sexual and gender identities. 

I like women's fashion. I take an interest in what women wear, and like it when I see a well-dressed women. I also think men should have more variety in their wardrobe. To me, women have more variety. 

For the past few months I've been wondering if I'm trans. And I have no idea. I have never felt uncomfortable having a penis, nor have I ever wanted breasts or a vagina. On the contrary, I liked going into puberty and seeing more body hair and a deeper voice. I went to an all guys school, and I never felt uncomfortable being there. But I've been hung up on the idea that maybe I am trans.

I have a sexual fetish for women's and men's clothes. Not for everything, mostly women's hosiery, heels, and men's shoes. 

I really like how a few women look. So much so, that if I were a woman I would want to look like them. For instance, Audrey Hepburn. If I had to look like a woman, I would want to look like her. 

I am very self conscious about my voice. I really want to have a deeper voice, but I hate my current voice. 

I used to be really into men's and women's clothes, but recently I haven't been interested.

I don't mind having a penis, nor do I mind having facial or body hair. Actually, I quite like having facial and body hair. 

I've sort of lost touch with my own personal masculinity. I guess I just feel like I lost my identity or a part of me. 

I don't mind it when people see me as a man. 

I have thought about cross-dressing  for sexual pleasure and because I want to look sexy.

I also have a fetish for forced feminization and pegging. 

I have a bit of an odd relationship with my appearance. I like how I look (sometimes). But I always picture myself looking different. I always picture myself as a different, better-looking man. But then I look and I'm not. 

Most of my role models have been men. I always wanted to be a suave, well dressed man i.e. when I was younger I really wanted to be James Bond because he was good looking and just suave. 

I sometimes have trouble identifying with some men. I identify with some women, and I naturally get alone better with them and prefer their company. Additionally, when I'm around women I feel most like a man. 

When I'm around some guys, I feel they look at me like I'm weak or small or, quite frankly, a girl. And I don't like that. But when a girl sees me as a man, that makes me happy. 

Some other facts, I've freaked out and had breakdowns about other things. I had a period where I was afraid I was gay. My sister said I had homosexual OCD (HOCD). I once had an irrational and paranoid fear that I was going insane, when I was really just depressed. That being said, I wonder if my fear about being trans is just another one of those irrational fears I have. 

I'm really skinny, and I've had issues finding clothes that fit me like I would like. I am also extremely self conscious. As a result, there isn't much variety in my wardrobe. I fear that this combined with my interest in women's fashion makes me trans.

I have some ""feminine"" characteristics. I'm submissive, eager to please, I'm emotionally sensitive, and I like serving people. 

 I've always identified as being more feminine, but I've always known logically I was a boy. 

I've also seen myself as more masculine sometimes, as well. 

Last but not least, I've always been curious as to what it's like to be a woman.

With all of that being said, what do you think I am? Am I trans and in denial? Or am I just a cis guy who doesn't fit? Or am I something else?

*Trigger warning (again), the following features talks about suicide and the murder of trans/GQ/NB people. Read at your own discretion. 

I've had fragments of this poem floating around in my head since the passing of Leelah Alcorn back in December. I wanted to write something specifically on her passing at that time, but didn't feel I had much place to as I didn't know her. As this year has progressed and so many trans women (and in specific trans women of color) have died my subconscious decided I had to write something and woke me up at 4am. Anyway, this is kinda second draftish (it's kinda hard to edit without tearing up), but I hope it touches some hearts.

------------

""Dear You""

Dear you,

I wonder what you saw just before bright headlights 

made everything dim. 

I wonder if you saw the mirrored grace 

of a reflection that was almost yours. 

Dear you,

I wonder how the rope felt as you tied the knot 

that turned a closet into a coroners photograph

a picture of a frame that was never truly your own. 

Dear you,

I wonder what you heard between the chambered round ringing 

and the strike of the hammer. 

Was it a canticle chorus of ""God doesn't make mistakes"".

Dear you,

I wonder what you tasted as your fathers blade 

split into your stomach,

the foul bitterness of his words internalized 

that would spill across your tongue. 

Dear you,

I wondered what you smelled before fists
 
made matchsticks of your nose. 

Could you scent the panic he said he felt
 
before ending yours. 

Dear you,

I wonder what you were thinking as a dark alley 

made you disappear. 

Dreams of your future lived as yourself 

now entombed in those shadows. 

Dear you, I wish I didn't have these thoughts. 

Dear you, I wish I didn't have to write this poem. 

Dear you, I wish I could outstretch my arms,

Rampart my ribs and spire my spine 

to shield you from a world so filled with hate. 

But dear you,

You are no longer with us. 

And dear you,

I can only carry you in my heavy heart,

my mournful thoughts,

and my desperate prayers.

So dear you,

I write this as a record

And hope I never have

to add another line. 

Dear you,

I write this to your memory. 

Dear you,

I write to you with love.

Up until a month ago I identified as cis male and had 0 problems with that. I don't remember what caused me to question myself. I started asking myself things like, ""Am I ok with identifying as male?"" and every time I would answer ""I don't know"". I don't think I want to be a girl, I'm not sure.

I'm fine with my body and that I'm growing facial/body hair, have a deep voice etc, but I do get embarrassed when someone points it out (not sure if that has anything to do with this). Sometimes I look at girls (mostly in video games and anime) and think ""wow they are really pretty/beautiful or they have a nice voice"" I found this odd because I'm gay. I think I'm okay with male pronouns. Although, sometimes having body hair feels kinda... odd? I can't really explain it.


Ever since I first read about male puberty, I though it sounded cool and was excited to someday go through it, I remember in PE I used to look at the other guys armpits because I could see hair growing and hoped I'd get some soon.


I know you can't tell me what I am, but any help is really appreciated. Feel free to ask me anything.


P.S.Something that I don't understand is, how does someone know when they feel ""male"" and/or ""female""? I don't understand

2015-02-20 05:32:09,2wipls,4,3,"**Warning for discussions of mental health, self harm and transphobic/homophobic slurs I guess if that bothers you**

I've been wanting to say something about this on here for a while, but don't want to do it on my main account. Maybe see if anyone here has had near similar experiences, or maybe just to get it off my chest.

I've been generally confused about my gender and thinking I may be trans since last spring. The issue I'm talking about started last month.

I'm 16, afab (transboy? I don't know if I can claim that) and while I don't have a word for it, I've sort of got a voice. I mentioned it in the few other posts on this account (all of which I wrote in the middle of or coming down from an episode, so be aware). 

The voice, it's a male presence and he touches me (hardly ever in a sexual manner) and talks to me and sometimes makes me do things. The most recent issue is that he wants me to cut up my skin, which I do. But when we talk I don't feel like I'm really me or really real. I never see him. I think I do out of the corner of my eyes sometimes. He comes and goes. He can't understand me unless I respond aloud. He's not here now.

When he's good he's nice to me. He holds me and tells me I'm his good boy, his pretty boy, and that he loves me very much. He tells me if I do what he wants me to, he'll make sure I get a cock and a nice flat chest when I'm older. Says I'll be so happy. He'll call me a good girl sometimes, but that's less and less. He's so nice to me.

But when I don't listen to him or do something wrong or tell him he's not real, it gets bad. He makes me cut my skin when I do those things. He yells at me. Calls me a filthy tr*nny boy. A dirty f*g. Disgusting waste of space. Worthless. Says I'm a stupid bitch and I'm just pretending. It really fucking hurts when he does this.

I know its not normal to be hearing things, and I don't know if I'm actually trans or if its just a symptom of whatever else is happening. Looking in mirrors is hard but I don't know if I can't make the thing staring back feel like me because it has tits and fat thighs or because of how he makes me think. I'm scared I'm just like he said- pretending caught up in it.

2015-02-20 12:51:28,2wjjdz,4,18,"AMAB, I think I'm finally able to be honest with myself. When I think of how I feel about my gender, it kinda bounces from andro to effeminate of center. 

I suppose if you were to put it on a spectrum, most of the time it hovers around: M----+--F

But I also have a fairly masculine personality in many ways... maybe it's my current hormonal setup? Maybe it's just how I am, but I kinda like ""traditionally"" masculine hobbies/interests despite my gender identity on most days.

I've known I've been pansexual for a few years now, I've been dating a wonderful transwoman and I've tangentially followed a few trans* communities for a while now. I've always questioned myself because I've always had anxiety and felt out of place. But I kinda put it all together, and it's left me all-at-once exhilarated, scared and thinking.

The best way to explain it is that I feel like a tomboy born as a male. I would love breasts and a female body (genitals could go either way, I flip flop), and I would like to be generally recognized at least mostly femme (not sure on label but not too concerned.) But I want to still have short-ish hair, dress fairly masculine (jeans, male/female button-up, canvas shoes) and still have a fairly butch attitude (still following me? lol.) Sexually I can get into being a top well enough but most days I'd rather bottom... in fact many times both in prior relationships with guys and casual sex, I always liked the idea of being held/cuddled/fucked like a girl.

I have a fairly middle-of-the-road voice in terms of pitch, skinny, tall with decently wide hips considering my sex and frame. Other than some proportions (and huge feet/hands ugh) I feel fairly blessed considering my desired presentation. I think I'd like hormones. I've seen what they do countless times and in person, and... idk I feel like the mood changes, body changes, everything seems to just look so, I don't know, desirable? I can't say I ever feel super dysphoric 90% of the time and if I ever do it's mostly my size/frame. But there's something about it that just seems right in a way.

So, guess I figured me out for the most part. That's pretty great really, but now I feel stuck. I know I'd have support if I came out, but... I'm not ready at all. I'm barely able to come out to myself. I shudder at the thought of telling my gf who herself is trans. Oddly enough I trans family as well. If anything that makes it feel worse? I don't want it to be ""special"", my family made a huge deal of it (in a good way) last time, I just wanna put it out there and be done with it. I guess the idea of social transitioning scares the shit out of me since I feel socially anxious in the first place.

Then there's the whole living my life as a non-binary individual. that... The idea terrifies me. Scares me shitless. But I really want it. It's almost like an emotional feeling of an immovable object being hit with an unstoppable force. I want it so bad, but I'm not ready in the slightest. 

So that's my story I guess. Take it for what you will, I just really needed to write that. I guess I could use advice for where I should go from here, but I think I just have a lot to come to terms with still. My apologies for typos or clarity issues I'm hella sleep deprived.

[EDIT] - Corrected spelling

[EDIT #2] (All below this line)

So, I've been doing a lot of searching, and it seems like, contrary to my initial assumptions, posts along the lines of ""Can you help me figure out my identity"" would actually be on-topic here.  So I'm going to edit that in here.

So, up until recently, I identified pretty solidly as a cis-male, who was sorta hetero-flexible, and I identified as poly and a switch in the BDSM sense.  The bottom half of my switch is emotionally masochistic, and there was a lengthy period of time where I would get off on the sort of forced-fem fetish.  It was something I suppressed in myself, rather angrily, because I believed for the longest time that the only explanation for a forced-fem fetish was some messed up internalized mysogyny and trans-misogyny - I assumed that being turned on by these things was a moral failing.  Nonetheless, like any time you try to suppress an aspect of your sexuality, it wouldn't stay down and I'd have recurring moments of wanting it.

So fast forward to a few months ago, I'm having a discussion with a new kinky partner and we're doing the whole what-turns-you-on negotiation thing.  I'm talking to her about my emotional masochism, and giving examples of things that work, and sort of sheepishly admit this one.  I've never had a partner freak out before, but until this conversation I'd never gotten a response other than ""I accept that, but it's not my thing"".  So she's interested in trying it with me, a night of gender-bent stuff, she's even willing to don a strapon and gender-bend herself, even though it would be a new exploration for her as well.

In a moment of being overcome with gratitude at being accepted, I felt like I wanted to even put aside my emotional masochism to show her a good time - I felt like if we were going to try this, I wanted to be the ""best"" woman for her I could (not that I every truly understood what ""best"" would be).

Point is, we tried a night, it went well.  We tried a whole weekend genderbent, and it was amazing.  I got to wear lingerie, she dressed and acted more traditionally masculine.  I felt pretty, and it was strangely very validating.

So if that's all we had, I would mark this all up as a fetish and move on.  I have no desire to live that way full time, or even a majority of the time.  But there was more.  When I was in that ""mode"", I felt downright dysphoric about my penis.  I had to have sex with the panties on so I couldn't see it. I'd get upset-feeling if attention was drawn to it.  I'm a very hairy dude, and I positively *hated* my body hair.

So, I guess what I'm asking for input on is:
 (a) Is there pre-existing nomenclature for that - someone who feels distinctly masculine at some times, distinctly femme at others, and never any androgyny between.
 (b) I deal with a lot of guilt due to feelings that so much of ""femininity"" is socially constructed that my desires to be pretty and pleasing, to bake and to focus more on giving pleasure than receiving, etc are all just symptoms of a sexist worldview deep-down.

The person in question would also have full veto of me not publishing photos they do not want to be public.\n\nHowever, it's kind of hard to find these people, I don't want to ask people in a rude way and in worse case scenario give them the impression of seeing them as a freak show at my disposal.\n\nSo my question is now where do I find these people? How do I ask them in a non-rude way if they're interested? I'm starting to think I perhaps should start searching within the whole trans-community, not being this specific.\n\nFor that matter, if anybody here lives in Austria (or Germany) and think this project sounds interesting, feel free to send me a message! If there was interest I'm also up for involving more than only one person in this project."", 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': ""Where to find genderqueer's interested in my photo project?"", 'created': 1424720593.0}"

This is the first time I've actually spent time talking about my own gender issues using this account - it's usually devoted to talking about my relationship with my partner, who's a trans woman.

I've identified as genderqueer since long before it was ""cool"" - someone put the label on me twenty years ago and it stuck - but I haven't always been very visible or open about it. 

In the meantime, I ended up gravitating to other gender variant people, to the point where I have a really large number of trans friends (at least five of whom came out after I'd known them for a while). 

So now that I've been making moves toward being more openly genderqueer, I keep thinking to myself that I'm just copying people. I keep reminding myself that *I made friends with these people for a reason*, because we had things in common and gender variance is one of those things, but it still nags at me.

Personally, I would like to present myself in a way that would assuage my gender dysphoria, but for my own reasons, I've accepted that as an impossibility (and in all fairness, dealing with dysphoria seems to be reserved only for the beautiful). So I present as a guy who wears nail polish, and occasionally eye liner. 

Now that I'm trying to network with other queer people, I feel like an imposter, or an outsider. Because I am unable to tick all the boxes, people constantly want to label me, but it never feels like a label of acceptance, more ""you're not this, you're that."" 

What's arguably worse are those who want to accept me, but because I'm not beautiful, I make them uncomfortable. I'm like a living reminder to them that transgender is not fair, and transition is not possible just because you wish it.

If I were skinny and not balding, I feel like I'd be more acceptable as queer. I feel if I were assigned female at birth, I'd also be more welcome (and not questioned) in the community.

Okay uhm, I may not be completely coherent but sharing with my wall or car isn't as effective as normal right now, so I come to share with the oblivion here. 

A little background: 20, AMAB. The past few years I have given up on the dating world, not out of spite or anything like that, it just didn't make sense to me. I don't generally feel attraction and if I do it's usually satisfied by friendship, a simple hug keeps me physically satisfied plenty well, so dating seemed like a pointless complication for me. 

Okay about a month or so ago a new girl came into a gender related discussion group I attend weekly. I had a weird attraction to her and I decided to pursue a friendship and kinda explore this odd occurrence. She didn't end up returning to group as she's a teacher and pretty busy but we did end up friends on facebook and on one especially confident and adventurous day last week I asked her out. I've been on dates before but I was pretty excited to actually go on one as myself, in an adorably femme outfit.

The date was cool, to avoid going on raving about her geeky and pleasant atmosphere I will simply say that conversation was easy. We ate and then went to her place and played some videogames for a bit. On the surface it was all pretty straight-forward normal stuff for me, talking remained easy and we laughed and had fun... 

But wtf, I can't look at her face without wanting to simultaneously vomit and cry. The hug we shared before I left was not pleasant and satisfying as usual, but utterly painful and the last look on her face when we departed is like burned into my brain, she looked at me in the most direct way I've ever experienced and I practically ran away from it. I could only imagine it was an invite to kiss and usually that would have me worried in a completely different way, that I would have to clear up misunderstandings. Rather I have a million completely new worries, not to mention insecurities. 

I guess this is all kinda textbook romance shit but my confusion has been morphed and magnified. I can kinda understand where romantics are coming from now but I mean it's still essentially a chemical reaction to encourage procreation... I don't understand how this nauseous feeling is meant to be pleasant or encourage anything... 

It went fine, great even. I was not rejected, further connection is very much available, and she has no problems with my gender identity..
