So, I'd come across the term ""aporagender"" while browsing Tumblr, and I fell into a rabbit hole of Genderqueer blogs and Wikipedia articles on the topic. Of course, I emerged no wiser and filled with more questions. However, I think there's something that could clear up a lot of my confusion, which is learning how the Genderqueer community defines the word ""gender.""

Before my research, I'd used the word interchangeably with sex, rather than a differentiation between masculinity and femininity as it's been apparently used for the past 40-some-odd years. I'm getting more pieces, but I'm having problems making them fit (which is probably a problem in itself, thinking about it). 

Example: I read an aporagendered person does not identify as male or female or anything in-between, but still feel gendered. By gendered, does this person perhaps mean they don't fit in with any social roles but their own, or they don't fit in with any sex?

Any comments on this topic would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!

**EDIT**: *I really appreciate the responses I got here. I've definitely learned some new things. One of the things I've learned is, in spite of most of the commenters saying there was no concrete and/or tangible ""genderqueer community,"" everyone's practically on the same page as far as defining gender.

I'm so lost right now. I know we can't hold people up on pedestals but I've still never had this happen before so I have no response to it.

I am agender, pansexual, poly, queer. I live in a rural area and have experienced as much harassment as anyone. I am ridiculed every day that I leave my house or worse. I'm not here to talk about that though.

I am not comfortable around people who say things like ""die cis scum"". When I hear people simply turn around the kinds of words that have been hurled at me every day and aim them at cis people it brings me no relief or pleasure. That said, I don't generally say anything about it because I simply remove myself from situations in most cases where that kind of discussion is happening.

A few days ago a transwoman brought this kind of language into a space where I didn't expect it or feel it was appropriate. It is not a space about gender issues. So I said something, just about the fact that this kind of language isn't comfortable for me and that I didn't feel it was appropriate to throw that kind of speech around very publicly in a space that is about broader sexual issues with a lot of cis people in it.

I was extremely polite but made it clear that I didn't feel it was appropriate to do what she was doing (claiming that all cis people shouldn't be allowed to speak on a variety of issues many of which do affect cis people, basically wanting to throw all cis people out of a group that, again, is about broad sexuality). As soon as I said something I was viciously attacked by her and several other people and told I was in league with the oppressor.

Then my own identity was called into question, even though my identity is known and should not be a question. Several people ganged up on me at this point and told me I was just a cis person looking for attention and all kinds of other stuff.

I'm shocked and hurt than a transwoman would belittle/question my identity. I don't think I'm looking for advice, I just don't know who I can even talk to about this. One of my safest spaces (or so I thought) has been shattered, and by someone I just assumed would know better.

2015-12-10 23:19:47,3walzr,8,8,"He is, practically speaking, very smart, but he's also a little bit conservative.  He has essentially provided me with two reasons he is ""against"" the idea of Hormone Replacement Therapy.  I'd love to refute him, but I'm not exactly sure what to say.

1. He claims that HRT cannot possibly be good for you because you're injecting something into your body.  He compared it to smoking (T or E in your body is like smoke in your lungs - ""foreign substance"") and said that it can't possibly be good for you.  The only rebuttal I could come up with was that when people start out on a hormone blocker to stop their natural hormones from being produced, their body becomes ""unhappy"" without a primary hormone, and then it becomes happy again regardless of whether Testosterone or Estrogen becomes the ""primary"" hormone.  He, however, seemed focused on the fact that your body becomes ""unhappy"" and associated that with the blocking of T or E specifically rather than the absence of any major hormone, in general.

2. When discussing a more personal side of it, he also claims that he doesn't want me to take any kind of low-dose E because he doesn't want me to get harassed or judged.  While he claims he is trying to be kind (and he might be, I honestly don't know), what he's really doing is victim blaming.

He has essentially provided me with two reasons he is ""against"" the idea of Hormone Replacement Therapy.  I\'d love to refute him, but I\'m not exactly sure what to say.\n\n1. He claims that HRT cannot possibly be good for you because you\'re injecting something into your body.  He compared it to smoking (T or E in your body is like smoke in your lungs - ""foreign substance"") and said that it can\'t possibly be good for you.  The only rebuttal I could come up with was that when people start out on a hormone blocker to stop their natural hormones from being produced, their body becomes ""unhappy"" without a primary hormone, and then it becomes happy again regardless of whether Testosterone or Estrogen becomes the ""primary"" hormone.  He, however, seemed focused on the fact that your body becomes ""unhappy"" and associated that with the blocking of T or E specifically rather than the absence of any major hormone, in general.\n\n2.

2015-12-17 16:20:03,3x89et,14,8,"Hi, I hope this is the place to seek this kind of advice, redirect me if necessary.
Few months ago I realized that I’m gender fluid. But I do have a problem, for over 18 years I lived as a male in a conservative christian family. I was only able to finally realize who I am, because at that point (2 years ago, I’m 20 now) I moved out, became atheist, and had the opportunity to think about anything LGBTQ from and different perspective. 

Unfortunately those 18 years of anti-gay propaganda left a huge scar on my mind, there is a large part of me that still says it’s all wrong, it’s not right, it’s a sin, it’s evil and that no matter what I read and say I was born with a penis, so I’m male and nothing else. That’s on top of bullying and self deprecation between ages of 12-16 when I guess I first started to realize I’m not *just* male, but forced myself to be as masculine as I could.

I don’t know how many of you are or were religious, but I no longer believe in the existence of any god. Even if there is something more out there, the last thing on it’s mind would be what I wear and how I style my hair. But while I had no problem breaking many other rules and commandments, I still fear that how I dress, style my hair and what pronouns I use is exactly the one reason I will be punished for eternity.

This also causes a lot of stress now, if I had to put numbers to it I’m male about 60% of the time, while female only 10%, the rest of the time I’m in between genders or I don’t feel like any. But when I do feel not-male, and especially when I feel feminine, I tend to hide it, forcing myself to stop playing with my hair and staying in my room until my gender changes again. I’m not hiding from others though, I have not made a scene out of coming out, but with the changes I made to my appearance, the way I conduct myself and how I speak I know that if not already one day most people will realize I’m a bit different, I also never refer to myself as a man or male, but as a person or a human.  I’m hiding this because of the “I was male first” mentality, and I feel like if I could rid myself of it, I would not only have the courage to go out more, but the proportions of what and how often I am, would be different as well.

Will those thoughts ever go away? Can I be what I wanted to become for so long, without hating myself? Any suggestion how to undo and combat all those years of brainwashing is welcome.

2015-12-18 07:00:57,3xbfb8,7,7,"Hi /r/genderqueer!

You all seem nice and supportive so I figured I'd make an account just to post here. :) Sort of a throwaway but I might keep it around.

So, to keep things short, I'm AFAB and realized I am transgender about a month ago (after over a year of self reflection, examination, experimenting with labels, and experimenting with my gender performance)! Yay! This made me really, really happy, probably the happiest I've been in years. I felt like I found the missing part of myself. The first time I declared, ""I am transgender"" to my therapist I cried tears of joy. :')

A day passes and I'm still pretty happy, but quickly become depressed within a week. My baseline has changed from ""meh"" to ""happy,"" though. I smile when I think about being trans.

Then, I realize.. okay, so I know I'm trans. And trans is an umbrella term.

I'm trans, but I'm trans*what*? I have no idea. Up to this point, I had only heard about binary trans identities. Nonbinary was a very .. out there concept to me. Am I a transman? I don't know. When I think about being male, it makes me feel nauseous, and suicidal.. for some reason. I have no idea why. There's some little yellow flower of happiness in there, but it's so buried I can't see it. 

As for my identity: I guess right now I'm going with neutral because I'm figuring things out. I don't feel female but might feel male. I am 100% certain I am not female. 

To sum it up, my therapist has been a great help to me for over two years, for reasons unrelated to gender. But.. she didn't know the difference between gender identity and sexuality, misgendered and deadnamed her transman intern while telling me about him, and I feel that the two of us are at a strange point where she may not be able to help me anymore.

So, to end this rambling: does anyone have any resources to help me figure out the trans*what* part? I would like to see a gender therapist, but I am a very broke, poor, college student. The only reason I could see my current therapist is because my tuition already paid the fees.

Any advice is appreciated!!

2015-12-23 21:18:10,3y0a8r,6,11,"Last week I went to see Star Wars with some friends of mine. It was going to be the last time I saw that group of friends until after the holidays, so even though I was SO EXCITED about Star Wars I was mostly looking forward to spending time with people.

I'm out to them, so I didn't have to worry as much about presentation. A few weeks ago, I saw that there was [a line of Star Wars makeup from CoverGirl](http://covergirlstarwars.tumblr.com/). I picked up a thing of lipstick and mascara, plus some eye shadow. I figured it was a good way to experiment with femme presentation while ""dressing up"" for the movie (and doing so in a way that didn't flaunt [the new safety rules](http://www.dailydot.com/geek/star-wars-force-awakens-movie-theater-costume-policy-guide/) a lot of theaters have for the movie).

So I put on some of the makeup and went out wearing a t-shirt and a kilt. I was supposed to meet my friends for dinner but I got there early so I killed some time at a bookstore. I met them for dinner a while later, we had some really great pizza, I gave them their Christmas presents (which they really seemed to like) and then we meandered over to the theater. It was a really great night so far.

And then we stood in line.

A woman came out of a showing, probably an earlier showtime for Star Wars. She was older, very WASP-y, and was there with her husband. My friends and I were there minding our business and she came up to me and one of my friends (who identifies as male but also paints his nails and dyes his hair bright colors) and said with this sort of vacant smile, ""are you two in costume?""

My friend said we're not and tried to politely nudge her along but she was like... not taking the hint. And kept asking (in a fairly non-aggressive but nonetheless *insistent* way) why I was dressed the way I was.

I didn't really say anything, just shrugs and head shakes, and my friend did most of the talking. But man, she really didn't want to let it go. Her husband did finally pull her away.

I dunno. I know I should've brushed it off but it made me feel really uncomfortable. She wasn't even mean or confrontational. She was just very clueless and didn't know how to take a hint.

And it sucks because that night was one of the happiest I've had all year (especially after the movie, holy wow did I love TFA) and apart from that episode the evening was unambiguously good. But there was that *one thing* that made me super uncomfortable. Thankfully that friend sensed what was going on with me and kinda talked me down before the movie started.

I realize I'm just overreacting and that I should just brush this off. I think I'm just anxious about coming out in a couple months and freaking out about going out in public while presenting as femme (or at least more openly queer), and the incident at the movie theater just kinda foregrounded a lot of the stuff I'm anxious about (even if the incident itself was fairly tame).

2015-12-27 07:49:47,3ydnna,3,8,"Thank you for reading this. I could use some help and any at all would be appreciated. And I’m sorry I don’t know more about this stuff and if I'm being offensive or stupid.


First, I'm a 29 year old straight male. I feel like an old person struggling to understand a changing society. Ten to fifteen years ago, maybe it was where I lived, you never heard about any of this gender stuff. You were straight, gay, trans, or had a fetish. That was it.


In the last five years, I started hearing more about different non-binary(?) genders, but it first reached me via hearing about tumblrinas on reddit and always came across with negative connotations. Like Mr. Garrison on south park, going gay, trans, and then gay again while still being trans. That sort of vibe, maybe a bad example.


The situations could be funny, yet it always felt mocking as if these people were making it up and the concept itself was ridiculous. I had no real opinion, except ""Yeah, some people might make stuff up for attention or focus on it too much, and maybe some of it is a cultural fad I don’t know, but I’m sure it’s also 100% legit and very real thing like being gay that deserves support and understanding."" It was always an uncomfortable mix with mostly just not understanding. 


I knew in my heart there was more to it. But I kind of avoided thinking about it or applying it to myself.


Then a show came out. Steven Universe. And my own universe shattered. I realized I was a Pearl. Yes, absolutely. The similarities are often literal. Love for giant, giant women and everything.


I'm a straight male and I'm into girls who look like girls. BUT I'm not attracted to women being submissive and males being dominant. Gender roles are completely backwards for me to the point of ""normal"" being extremely uncomfortable. Like, I want to be the girl in the relationship, if that even makes sense. I love baking, cleaning, decorating, homemaking, and teaching! I’m like a 1950s housewife and mom. And in the bedroom I want my hair pulled and to feel claimed, owned. I'm extremely emotional, empathetic, and I often give my male friends relationship advice (that has landed them in long term relationships) based on WHAT I WOULD WANT DONE TO MYSELF. I’m literally telling my male friends how to romance me. It’s weird how different they are. That should make me think, right?


I don’t have an urge to dress like a girl, but I keep myself shaved and I hate body hair on myself as hair for the most part is icky. Thankfully my hair is super blonde and so it looks like I don’t even have any. I want to look pretty, but not look exactly like a girl because that’s what I’m attracted to. 


Yet I’m extremely envious of girls because they get to have all the fun with makeup and clothes!! Guy stuff is so incredibly boring. So in past relationships I would take my GF shopping, do her makeup, and express and enjoy this vicariously through her. But because I don’t want to dress like a girl like I see other trans folk do, I feel my feminine feelings must be less legitimate. Or something. Maybe… I should try a little light makeup on myself...


I feel alone, isolated, confused, and very uncomfortable. I wonder if I'm doing this to myself. Like that I've warped myself somehow, and I'm making things hard for no reason. Like, I'm doing this to myself, I'm making this up. That all men maybe feel this way at some point, but it's their job to be the men. I should just be a dominant guy, the ""real man"" that most women want if I ever want to find someone (it’d be so much easier if I were gay, but I’m not!). Would I be faking it as a “real man”? Or just being who I naturally should be? Do I need to man up, because all men feel this way at some point, and that’s why the expression exists?


And I don't want others to think I'm submissive because I want to do less work, or have the other partner make all the decisions, it's not like that at all. I want an equal relationship, but I want to be the little spoon, the one on the bottom. If I were a woman I'd be a strong, independent woman. I’M STRONG IN THE REAL WAY and I wouldn’t hesitate to fight for freedom! But I'd still want my partner to be the dominant one. http://i.imgur.com/ZGNryqX.jpg


Even as I write this I'm thinking ""there's no way you genuinely can feel this way, this is all in your head, just man up, you are a man, no man or woman will respect you like this. You're making your life needlessly difficult."" Can I respect myself like this? I’m kind of half out of the closet, but I’m confused if I’m in the closet, do I even need to tell others? Or am I pretending to be in a closet?


WHAT AM I DOING!?


I'm so confused. What am I? Are there others like me? AND HOW DO YOU DATE LIKE THIS?! I created an “honest” OkCupid profile and going through profile after profile of women who want ""a tall, real man who knows how to treat a women"" yet are 90%+ is so incredibly depressing it makes me want to just bottle up all this and be that “man.” It fuels the whole ""See, you're doing this to yourself and self-sabotaging"" I'm just embarrassed when they visit my profile. If there is a girl out there who would fit as my other half, it must be like finding a needle in a haystack and I'm sure there are more people looking for these needles than there are needles. 


Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I don’t have money or time for a therapist and I live in the middle of nowhere at the moment. I have to work through this on my own. I just want to know what I might be, or what I should do.
