2015-01-03 06:53:56,2r6n4b,8,6,"Long time lurker, first time poster, so hello. 

I'm quite shy, so it feels a bit unnatural to draw attention to myself with a story as I'm about to tell, but this subreddit seems so filled with kind and awesome folks that I decided it was time for an introduction of sorts. I'm AFAB, 23 years old, and never really thought of myself as any sort of queer until recently, when my queerness was called into question. 

I grew up quite the gender-nonconforming person, a little girl who loved dresses but only cared about bugs, dirt, and dinosaurs, and at age 8 cut her hair and started dressing as and wanting more than anything to be a boy, a stage in my life that lasted for about two years. Due to the pressure and confusion of adolescence and middle school, I started presenting more femininely for a time, but then reverted to more of a butch style by a year later. I think it was around that time I acknowledged that I was a girl, but with a little bit of boy mixed in, which was a mindset I stuck with until recently. I never had a problem with female pronouns or being called a girl, but my identity was always more of ""I'm a *different* kind of girl."" Thinking back at it now, I identified most strongly as female when in ""women in science"" discussions, but other than that, I couldn't really stand the societal expectations and stereotypes of women, because none of them fit me, and I never felt strongly attached to being female. None of this ever caused much tension, though, because society generally is accepting of tomboys or more masculine girls, and I was asexual at the time, so attraction and dating hadn't happened for me yet.

Fast-forward to a couple months ago. I work as a math tutor in a center located in a very affluent and conservative city, and one day received a call from one of my bosses that a parent had unusually specific complaints about the way I was dressing, including my Dc. Martens and blue hair (serious wtfs). Now, I am lucky to work under the people I do, as they had no complaints over my attire (casual dress code for tutors) and permitted me to have unnaturally-colored hair, so they were a bit bewildered as well, and told me just to be mindful of our very conservative clientele. I took it with a grain of salt, or I told myself I did. It actually hit me like a shit ton of bricks. It was then I realized how much pride I took in dressing androgynously, when I had to change out of cargo shorts and into an outfit I thought rich, conservative, private-schooled kids' parents would approve of. I wore some sort of blousey shirt and skinny pants, which felt too feminine and downright uncomfortable. 

After that, I struggled each day after that trying to decide what was appropriate, but not so much ""appropriate,"" really, when I thought about it. I was worried about what the complaints would be next. Am I queer? What if a parent or student realized I'm queer? How could I defend myself when this may actually be a problem for the people I serve? Being called out, even when I wasn't supposed to take it personally, became a very personal struggle of what being queer meant to me which I hadn't exactly breached before. It was never an issue at my very liberal college, with my friends, or with my bisexual boyfriend -- it never came up, it just *was*. I'm not even sure if I outright thought of myself as queer. My friends and I all acknowledged that sexuality and gender expression were vast oceans and not binaries. People were just people. I identified as just me, not really a specific gender, and not really straight. After the complaints, I realized I was definitely uncomfortable with cis-het, but didn't at first feel worthy of calling myself queer because I went so long without anything being a problem. ""Genderqueer"" was a new term to me I only had learned in the past year, but I lay in bed one night and noticed how it spoke to me, and how other genderqueer people's stories and experiences seemed so similar to my own. Both reading stories on the interwebs and talking to friends helped me validate the part of my identity I'd never bothered to slap a word onto. 

I'm feeling much better now, and after the shock wore off and I talked briefly with my bosses again, I don't worry as much about what I wear to work. (Unfortunately I can't wear ties (my favorite!) since it's casual, but oh well.) It feels so silly that there were several weeks where the issue of clothes was a tumultuous one, but realizing that my gender identity/presentation may actually be a problem to the people I interact with on a daily basis left me feeling slightly threatened. Of course that's all sorts of not okay, but I'd imagine gender expression in the workplace can be quite an issue for some genderqueer folks, even much more so than it was for me. It was such a relief to find genderqueer communities online so that I could know I wasn't alone in my feelings.

Sorry for the lengthy brainspew. I just hoped to share details so that others may relate. And feel free to share experiences, as I'd love to get to know some of you.

I met with a friend who does a lot of work in the community and spilled what I could. I was really anxious even though I knew he wouldn't judge me. I was able to get some really good resources in town and most importantly, talking through some of my uncertainty and questions gave me a huge sense of peace and more understanding of where I'm at in my process. I woke up yesterday feeling amazing!

Somehow through the last couple days I've had this wave of acceptance hit me so that, at least for right now, I feel really good with where I am. I got an appointment to start therapy in a week or so to help work through this. I even told my best friend that I'm somewhere in the trans* spectrum and am trying to figure out what that means to me but for now think I most closely identify with genderqueer. We talked about it for an hour or two and then ended up laughing and planning a shopping trip (something I've always despised but now I'm super excited because it's for clothes for who I am inside!) and she even asked what name and pronouns I wanted her to use.

It's so amazing to me, I know there will be ups and downs (especially when family finds out eventually) but for right now I feel like I have more clarity than I have had in so long and I just feel peaceful inside and like it's going to be OK. A week or two ago if someone told me this would all be happening would have thought they were crazy, it's amazing what happens when the blinders finally come off.

I was able to get some really good resources in town and most importantly, talking through some of my uncertainty and questions gave me a huge sense of peace and more understanding of where I'm at in my process. I woke up yesterday feeling amazing!\n\nSomehow through the last couple days I've had this wave of acceptance hit me so that, at least for right now, I feel really good with where I am. I got an appointment to start therapy in a week or so to help work through this. I even told my best friend that I'm somewhere in the trans* spectrum and am trying to figure out what that means to me but for now think I most closely identify with genderqueer. We talked about it for an hour or two and then ended up laughing and planning a shopping trip (something I've always despised but now I'm super excited because it's for clothes for who I am inside!) and she even asked what name and pronouns I wanted her to use.\n\nIt's so amazing to me, I know there will be ups and downs (especially when family finds out eventually) but for right now I feel like I have more clarity than I have had in so long and I just feel peaceful inside and like it's going to be OK. A week or two ago if someone told me this would all be happening would have thought they were crazy, it's amazing what happens when the blinders finally come off. \n\n\nTLDR; Holy shit, I came out to my best friend and it was better than ok. Today I feel like I could do almost anything."", 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Amazing day', 'created': 1420319691.0}"

&gt;You can play a male or female character without gaining any special benefits or hindrances.  Think about how your character does or does not conform to the broader culture's expectations of sex, gender, and sexual behavior. For example, a male drow cleric defies the traditional gender divisions of drow society, which could become a reason for your character to leave that society and come to the surface.
&gt;You don't need to be confined to binary notions of sex and gender. The elf god Corellon Larethian is often seen as androgynous or hermaphrodite, for example, and some elves in the multiverse are made in Corellon's image. You could play a female character who presents herself as a man, a man who feels trapped in a female body, or a bearded female dwarf who hates being mistaken for a male. Likewise, your character's sexual orientation is for you to decide.

Dierolls can be handled using /r/rollme. Shareable character sheets can be found at mythweavers.com. The usefulness of a play-by-post game is that it can accommodate players who might not be able to gather at the same time, be it across different timezones or problematic schedules.

I would be glad to offer my services as a Dungeon Master. I've been playing D&amp;D since 1996 and have experience with each edition from 2nd to 5th. I would recommend the 5th edition in particular for play-by-post since it doesn't rely as strongly on maps and grids for combat and combats are rather speedy in general.

2015-01-05 00:14:13,2rck8h,24,4,"Throwaway because I'm embarrassed. I'm FTM, 30s, pre-T, gay... and maybe genderqueer too. 

I met an adorable guy on New Year's Eve. I saw him, he was just my type, and then he spoke, and he was smart. I came out to him as trans and gay, right away, because I didn't want to be sad if he didn't like me. He still liked me. A lot. 

We spent most of the evening cuddling and talking... then kissing. We exchanged numbers, and we hung out again last night, just literally cuddling for hours. It was incredibly sweet and we confessed that we have huge crushes on each other. (I should add that the sexual tension between us was as thick as Beyonce's behind. We were powerfully attracted to each other. But we didn't go there, in fact we both expressed feelings of ""This is really important"" and ""I like you A WHOLE LOT"" and ""Let's not fuck this up, let's go slow"". So we did.)

The weird, weird, weird thing was that being with him made me feel... girly. I don't know what else to call it. I felt cute and tiny and sweet. His attention made me feel sort of... oh god, I don't know... attractive? Yeah. He made me feel pretty. I found myself wanting to hide in how he felt about me, turn his perception of me into my own. 

Part of it is that he's straight... and that I'm afraid that, when (if?) I start T, he won't like me anymore. We talked about it, and he wants to try anyway. He even talked about wanting to, uh... *do* a certain *thing* to *a certain male part of my body*... with his mouth. (!!!) But I'm still afraid with the body changes and my transformation, he won't feel like this about me anymore.

And the other part of is it that I do not want to be trans, I'd give almost anything not to be trans. I am afraid I won't be happy post-transition. I won't have a penis (I can't afford it, not unless insurance laws change). And T might ruin my voice: I'm a singer and I need to sing to be happy. 

Ugh, I promised myself I would never get with a straight guy again... 

**Have you ever experienced a shift in your perception of your gender (or a reduction in dysphoria) following a positive romantic and/or sexual interaction?** How long did it last? 

I have been trying to grok the idea that maybe I'm a genderqueer trans man. I don't know what to do about that. I feel incredibly confused. Is that even a thing? I loved feeling girly with him... but I still want my body to be masculine, just like I have for so many years. Does any of this even make sense? **Do any of the trans men here identify as genderqueer?**

I don't even understand what being genderqueer **is**, forgive me, but: I thought it was just some made-up Internet thing. Is it... me? What does that even mean? I don't deal well with abstract concepts. I am a very concrete thinker. I really don't know *how* to think about this. 

I don't want to be weird and different at all. I just want to be comfortable and at peace with myself. 

Whatever feedback comes to mind is welcome. 

Cross-posted to /r/ftm and /r/genderqueer (once new account allows it)

EDIT: I think his affection for me as a person AND his desire for my female body threw me for a loop. It felt like he was offering me love *and* a chance at normalcy. Like I could just slip into his arms, and be normal. Be a sweet man's girlfriend. Be loved. And I could skip all this painful and horrifyingly scary transition shit. (There's so much at stake, and it feels like I will never be sure enough to jump in and do it. I'm terrified.) 

I don't want to be different. I don't want to be different. I just want to be normal. I am so sick of being different that I could scream. I have Asperger's and ADHD and I didn't choose any of this, and I am *not* looking for attention. I just want to fit in to society and live a good life and be happy. I don't understand what's wrong.

Hi, I'm a 17 years old DMAB and Its been a long time since I wanted to wrote here, and I finally did it

So idk really where to start 

Since a long time I had a huge problem with my gender and stuff, like since I was ""young"" like 11 people started to mistake me for a girl, like very often I didnt know if it was because I started to let grow my hairs (I never cut them since) or something else, but at is age I wasnt really caring of that 

The real trouble with gender and sexuality started when I was 15 and I had my first love, It was an internet relationship and It was a boy, so first of all I thought I was ""just"" gay, so I did my coming out to my parent everything when good (It a chance to have very open minded parents) but during this relationship a crazy thought running trough  my head, it was ""If I was born as a girl?"" and since then I wanted to be a girl and I suffer of this incapability to be a girl, but when my relationship with him stopped I downed this tough deep inside my mind, but even tho I was drowning this idea, after I get into high school, I stared to act more like a girl, more feminine

Then after that the guy who I was sharing my dorm room with started to treat me more like a girl, calling me ""princess"" or kiss me on the cheek instead of hand shaking, and after this first year of high school i really wonder what I wanted to be, I mean gender speaking

But when I really started to think about it, I had a relationship with a girl (It was last summer) so at the first time I talked to her, but she was alot anxious about it, she was telling me thing like ""Im sure you preferred if I was a boy instead of a girl "" so I didnt want to mess up this relationship so I acted up like a male, but unfortunately at the end of the summer this relationship end up 

And to be honest It was the toughest break up I ever lived, since then alot of things came back, and then first I tried to avoid it, and I did regrettable thing ...

But after those thing I started to feel more comfortable with my non binary gender, I even brought a dress at a nearby animecon (It may sound a bit weird), but after sometimes I really wonder something (imo egoistic) and it was ""Am I gonna be desirable as a non binary gender ? ""  and since then this question is taking alot of my mind 


Even tho I talked about my non binary gender to my parents, and they was ok with it, I feel a bit confused and lost sometime

And since its a new year now, I decided to brought more feminine clothes like skirts, but still this question is really ruining my mood some time 

But to be honest I have no real purpose with this post I just wanted to share a bit to my life with you

2015-01-06 03:38:14,2rh5vh,1,2,"hello friends. this subreddit seems A LOT less intimidating / malicious / mean than some other online communities / resources on similar subjects. so i'm pretty glad this exists.

&amp;nbsp;
 
anyway, basically last night i told my girlfriend that i think i might be genderqueer / non-binary. she was perfectly understanding and supportive which made me feel really good.

&amp;nbsp;
 
regarding my identity though, i'm AMAB, but i've always had a slight aversion toward many of the main characteristics / traits that are generally associated with being a 'normal boy / man / male.' this sort of feeling has increased in intensity over time. 

&amp;nbsp;
 
identifying as non-binary seems to make sense for me because identifying as male has caused some upsetting internal conflicts for me. because a lot of the time (for one simple example) i will see something in a store that i like and i wont buy it because it seems 'effeminate' or something like that, like it doesnt align with my male gender identity. but if i were to identify non-binary, i wouldnt have this concrete 'rubric' that i have to put all of my likes / dislikes / actions / etc up against for comparison. if i identify this way theres no social construct telling me that my actions / feelings / expressions are 'wrong', and then im free to do whatever makes me happy, free to be myself.

&amp;nbsp;
 
i feel positively about they/them pronouns, but i'm also not against he/him pronouns -- to which my natural immediate response is to think that im not 'actually genderqueer' or something. i also feel comfortable with my girlfriend calling me pet-names that are strongly geared toward maleness. is it normal to not align with your birth given gender but still accept the pronouns / etc that are associated with it? does this make me 'not actually genderqueer' or something? im just having trouble validating this whole thing to myself, i feel like im being dumb or something. does this kind of thing sound like what it means to be queergender / non-binary / etc or am i maybe experiencing something else?

Alright, so, Non-Binary 101, let's go.

&gt;But how do you not ""feel like a guy?""

It is generally accepted in science that gender is a physical part of the human brain.  The most common theory is that it is affected by hormone exposure during brain development in the womb.  Remember that this is a field which hasn't had a *whole* lot of research done into it, because it's only recently been recognized as a real thing, so they're still working on figuring out the specifics.  A lot of the time you just have to take people at their word.

For more concrete evidence, try reading up on the [third interstital nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INAH_3) (INAH-3), part of our brains which has been found to be sexually dimorphic.  Namely, it's larger in men with more neurons.  In examinations of transgender cadavers, however, it's been consistently found to resemble what you would expect to find in individuals of their identified gender, regardless of if they had medically transitioned or not.

&gt;What would people say if I said I don't feel like I'm white?

Well, they'd probably laugh at you.  Unless you've got some rare skin condition, a white guy is gonna be white.  Remember that the same tumblrinas you're mocking are also the ones who get super upset about cultural appropriation.  Someone's skin color isn't part of their brain, of their perception of self; it's external and immutable.  The mental experience of being a person of color comes from having lived as a person of color--our brains are fundamentally the same.

&gt;But wtf does ""demi girl"" mean?

So, here's the thing.  There are a number of major non-binary identities accepted by the community at large.  Many of the ""gender of the day"" and ""snowflake"" terms you see on tumblr are just a result of kids wanting their own personal label, and I like to think they'll get over it eventually.  Maybe some of those terms will gain popularity and become more widely used, who knows.

The six terms you will hear the most often, that can be used by anyone, are as follows:

* agender, which refers to someone who feels they have no gender at all
* neutrois, similar to agender but considers that neutrality to be a gender on its own
* androgyne, being mentally ""in-between"" male and female
* bigender, simultaneously having a sense of being both male and female
* genderfluid, having an inconsistent or varying feeling of one's gender
* genderqueer, a catch-all term for anyone who doesn't feel as though any of the other terms work for them

There are also terms specific to certain cultures, such as *two-spirit*, which describes someone of indigenous American descent who fulfills both male and female roles within the tribe, and *hijra*, who are male-designated people from India who take on female identities and exist as an accepted third gender in their society.  Same with many *kathoey* in Thailand who might be more comfortable being seen as a ""ladyboy"" than just a lady.

Anything beyond that can almost always be safely ignored as tumblr nonsense.

In particular, ""demigirl"" and ""demiguy"" are some of those tumblr nonsense terms that have gained popularity recently and become more widely recognized as legitimate identities.  They are some of the few terms of that nature that I personally don't have a problem with.

A ""demigirl"" describes someone who is comfortable presenting female and using female pronouns to describe herself, but doesn't feel a strong connection to actually *being* entirely female.  This can either be someone designated female at birth who questions her gender but decides it isn't worth transitioning, or someone designated male that transitions despite not feeling *completely* like they're supposed to be a woman.

&gt;Dogkin, dragonkin, what does that mean, in practical terms?

Okay, so, otherkin.  Their existence is a perpetual thorn in my side, because they tend to make things more difficult for non-binary acceptance just by sounding so... nonsensical.

I tend to think of otherkin as being more of a spiritual identity than anything else.  It's someone who feels as though they have a strong connection with an animal, object, or concept, and that said connection has an effect on their personality.  Almost like a strange religion of sorts.

I respect their beliefs like I would any other spirituality or religion, but that doesn't mean I have to consider what they're saying to be legitimate.  Someone saying, ""I'm a wolfkin,"" is the same to me as them saying, ""Jesus loves me.""  I can sigh and agree with them, but that doesn't mean I have to drink the Kool-aid.

Think of gender as being a physical aspect of the human brain.  Something happened during the development of my brain to code it to run best on estrogen, but my body had already started to grow a penis and produce testosterone.  There's an innate, physical disconnect between body and mind, and it took me 20 years to figure that out--to realize why I was always unhappy.

Not all trans folk hate their genitals.  There's physical dysphoria, yes, but dysphoria can also be mental, social, emotional, and hormonal.  Personally, I'm indifferent to my penis, and I don't have enough of a problem with it to consider it worth tens-of-thousands of dollars and a number of medical risks to trade my original equipment for a close approximation of a vagina.

I started taking hormones as somewhat of a ""trial-run"" to see if it was right for me, and over a year later I've never been happier.  Having the *right* chemicals fueling my emotions was all I really needed.  Also, my hairline stopped receding before it became noticeable, so that's definitely a plus.  And boobs are certainly never a bad thing to be growing. 

Obviously some people fit the typical narrative of, ""I hate my genitals; I knew since I was a kid; I'm trapped in the wrong body,"" but for some of us it's more internal than anything.

2015-01-08 22:22:05,2rshiy,9,1,"Hello friends! I dearly hope it's alright to post this here - seems like one of the best places to get answers! (also very sorry for the amount of writing - I wasn't sure what to include)

I'm in the middle of writing a book and while I don't want to dive into detail, I will tell you that it's quite character-driven and the world surrounding my characters is very accepting. With this knowledge in mind I set about creating my characters and soon I discovered that while most my cast identified as male and female, three/four of my characters moved into a different zone. Let's call these characters Alex, Andy, Charlie and Paul - however I will not likely go in-depth with Paul. This book is also set in a time where there is royalty.

Alex defines as female, uses female pronouns, is introduced as female (""And my youngest, Princess Alex!"") and wears female clothes. She is MAAB though and doesn't seek to change her voice. My main character does notice this (and Alex's lack of chest) and somewhat informs the reader that Alex is male, but there is no further comment or disrespect. But later on there is a comment from a different character: She says 'prince' and then adds the 'ss' in a higher, mocking and hiss-like sound.

Andy defines as genderqueer/fluid, uses female pronouns, is introduced as another character's sister and wears female clothing. She is FAAB. She uses two names and corrects people on which name she is at the moment (one name is male and the other is female, the female name sounds neutral through); she is also called a 'handsome sweetheart' by her oldest brother. Andy and Alex end up getting together in the end.

Charlie defines as genderfluid/queer, uses the 'they' pronoun and I'm still working on how they'll be introduced. They are MAAB. Charlie was born into a family where everyone was respected - this included calling people 'sir' and 'madam'; Charlie's voice is also not what you'd say was kind on the ears and they come across as having quite a 'whiny, high-pitched English accent' that knocks off/replaces letters like a cockney accent (or at least my limited understanding of a cockney accent). But there's a problem; this world is very accepting of everybody, so I figured I'd use 'other' to describe the non-gendered nobles - but then I began using it on myself (I being genderqueer/fluid) and hated the term with a fiery passion. So I've switched it to 'mix'. Now, when Charlie is being referred to and introduced someone would say: Mix Charlie [..]. Charlie also wears a bow at some points when defining as more on the female side - I toyed around with them using a different name, too, but my beta reader has said it just confuses it.

Why am I writing all this and not asking a proper question I hear you ask? Well, these characters sort of *are* my questions; how do you feel about them?

With Alex-

* How do you feel about the main character clearly judging her on appearance but not being disrespectful when meeting her?

* How do you feel about another character (one who *lives* for causing trouble/drama) making a remark like this?

With Andy-

* How do you feel about her correcting people on her names?

* How do you feel about the 'handsome sweetheart' comments from her brother

* How should her siblings describe her? I've been looking towards the idea of 'broister' (brother and sister mixed); how does that sound?

With Charlie-

* Just how do you feel about this character in general?

* How do you feel about 'sir' 'madam' and 'mix'? Is there already something else I should consider?

And finally, is there anything about the characters that would put you off? The subject of gender is approached very softly in the book (it includes a scene where one character (who defines as male) is uncomfortably aware of having to put on a female voice to fool a noble - though I'm still not too sure on this one) and while it isn't the main focus, I don't want to draw people away from reading the book because of a word or because the main character is a bit stupid (looks Alex up and down and inwardly comments on her being flat-chested and again then informing the reader that, by Alex's voice, he believes she's actually male). I know I'm stepping on personal grounds here because gender *is* a very personal and important thing and I know I'll never be able to make everyone happy with these characters but I can damn well try!

2015-01-10 06:25:52,2rxxi5,5,7,"hello everyone, long time lurker but first time poster. i've been feeling really anxious about my gender identity and how it will put me at a disadvantage in life. 

for the past year i have been wrestling with myself about my gender - i'm afab and was fine with it for 20 years, but for half my life i was severely depressed and kind of just going through the motions of life. i did whatever people told me to do and didn't really have any plans other than survive and i just generally felt shitty most of the time. the good news is i've decided i want to get better but when i made that decision it required a lot of soul searching and in that time i learned i don't feel female all the time. in fact, most of the time i feel like i have no gender. and i can't stress enough *i don't want to feel this way*. i want to go back to feeling fine with being female but for some reason some inner part of me won't let me do that. i'll try to explain my situation further down.

basically this feeling is so strong that it's been extremely distressing and confusing for a few reasons - 1) i keep doubting myself 2) i don't really hate my body that much, i just wish i was built more gender neutral 3) i don't know what my gender is - i keep switching b/w feeling kinda ok w/ being female to completely not wanting to associate w/ that identity at all 4) i feel like maybe i'm making a big deal out of nothing and i wasted all my time feeling scared while doing nothing about it 5) i'm confused because i've known i was queer my entire life but i'm only just starting to reevaluate my gender 6) i fear i will be accused of being a ""special snowflake"" because i keep reading online that having a nb gender isn't real and no one would take me seriously 

don't get me wrong though - i don't hate the feminine gender identity. in fact, i want to embrace my feminine identity, but a nagging feeling inside me says i'm not a girl, i'm something else. i also don't hate the agender identity. if i lived in a vacuum, everything would be fine. but because of the situation i'm in, i fear i will never be able to accept that part of me. 

anyway, the reason why i want to just feel fine with my assigned gender rather than just accept myself is because i am terrified that if i make physical changes to look less feminine and start telling everyone to use they/them and call me my preferred name (all of which will make me feel more comfortable), i will not be able to find a high enough paying job that i can pay all my student loans back. i studied sociology bc i wasn't good at anything else at a private university my parents picked for me and am now 78k in the hole. if i am able to suppress my gender confusion then i MIGHT have a shot at getting a job that will pay me enough to pay my loans back, but if i don't, then no one will hire me and the loans will get bigger. i don't even know what i want to do w/ my life other than wanting to help people and make the world a better place. i feel the most content knowing i made someone happy, even though i hate myself.

anyway, i could use some advice on what to do. i am not out to anyone (i guess myself included?), i'm dealing w/ all this in addition to improving my mental health, i don't have any friends, and frankly i'm losing hope that i will ever be happy and live authentically. thankfully i live near an organization that provides free therapy to LGBT youth under 25, so my gender therapist has been so so supportive and helpful. but i'm under the wire here, i need to start paying my loans back but during my job search i feel like i have to either choose b/w my mental health (in presenting myself how i want) or my physical survival (in presenting how i'm assigned).

2015-01-11 23:15:37,2s3ty1,31,11,"Hi

I've spent like the last year questioning my sexuality and now I realise after surpressing it and lying to myself that I'm bisexual...and also in someways genderqueer. 

I'm male bodied and I love by body. I mad on triathlon and I'm really satisfied with my body - tummy, face privates and all. However occasionally I feel I'm neither gender, agender. So my questions are: 

   **1)** Can I be genderqueer yet still feel 100% content with my physical appearance and not get dysphoria?  

   **2)** Also would the correct word to describe this switching between guy and agender (in fact is that even possible?!) be bigender or is that reserved for switching between boy and girl? Would genderfluid or genderqueer be okay labels too? 

  **3)** Finally, to save hassle of explaining sexuality properly to people I mainly just say I'm a boy and use he/his/him pronouns, is that alright or would it be better say I'm bigender or genderfluid or genderqueer? 

And just food for thought: could my bisexuality be related to my genderqueerness/bigender-ness somehow?  Like given I feel agender could that influence my attraction to guys and girls?

We need:

* Moderators - people who can work on flairs and set up fun things to do and contribute

* Writers - people who will use the subreddit as a way of getting writing out there, critique out there, anything

**Some of the ideas put forward about the subreddit**:

* Prompts - anyone can submit a prompt, and other writers can answer it! *Idea from* /u/CedarWolf

* Writing Collection - where a mod would set a topic, have one person collect all submissions, host the submissions, and boom. *Idea from* /u/abandonthefort

* A weekly selfie post - to collect all selfies in one week of all the members who want to be involved! *Idea from* /u/Sixthsomatic

* Roleplay - two flairs would symbolise if it's an in-thread roleplay where people can co-write based on a genre or plot, and the other flair would be if someone is seeking a 1x1 type roleplay in PMs or off-site! *Idea from* /u/Hexacorpus

So, interested? Excellent! Come on over. And if you want to become a mod, please PM me and we'll get things set up! It'd be great to have someone set things up on a graphics/theme side too.

2015-01-21 17:42:04,2t6vi7,6,6,"Hello. I'm 19 and biologically female. I have presented myself as female for most of my life, except for the few times I tried to do otherwise and was discouraged from doing so by various authority figures. However, I don't always identify as female. Sometimes I feel like I'm female, sometimes I feel like I'm male, and other times I feel like both, or neither. I've always been referred to, and referred to myself, with female pronouns. I have an extremely feminine body, but really the only reason I dress in a traditionally feminine manner is because it works to my advantage, lol. Evidently, people think I'm attractive, and I can get free stuff XD. But that's beside the point.

I remember when I was in 5th grade, I asked my mom if we could go shopping for ""boy clothes."" She said yes, but that we had to go to The Gap (I hated the majority of their clothes, and in hindsight I think this was an attempt to deter me from cross-dressing). 

Anyway, we went shopping, and she picked out some ""boy clothes"" for me to try on. I did, but they were all extremely garish or didn't fit right, so I asked her if I could pick out some clothes, and she said yes, but we were in a hurry to be somewhere else, so if I didn't want the ones she had picked, we may not have time to buy ""boy clothes"" that day (again, I think she was trying to discourage me). Anyway, I remember I picked out some jeans, a few shirts, and a pair of camo cargo pants (I really liked the pants and wanted them so badly. They were so cool!). Unfortunately, as soon as I got back to the dressing room, my mother said that there wasn't enough time for me to try them on, and that we had to leave, empty-handed. I didn't ask again, because I think I knew that she didn't want me to wear ""boy clothes."" I got the hint.

Fast forward to 7th grade. I came out to my family as ""bisexual"" (I was aware of sexuality at a very young age). My mother said that it was just a phase and that I'd be ""boy-crazy soon."" She didn't forget to mention that ""being attracted to girls if you're a girl is wrong."" My father didn't really seem to care one way or another (he's always been way more accepting of that sort of thing than my mom). After hearing my mother invalidate what I had said, I never talked about it again. She had made me feel like I had done something wrong, like I was a freak. Shortly thereafter I became extremely depressed, started self-harming, and was hospitalized 3 times for suicide attempts.

Now on to 8th and half of 9th grade. At this point I was at an all-girls' residential treatment center (due to being a suicide risk) in Utah. I remember getting in trouble on multiple occasions for ""dating"" other girls there (dating was pretty much just cute nicknames and holding hands, because ya know, treatment. -.-*). I was notorious for being a flirt. Also at this point, I had chopped almost all of my hair off (I had a ""pixie cut"" with a long fringe). My hair had been almost down to my waist prior to this. I also frequently cross-dressed, which was discouraged at that treatment center, though they tolerated in more than my mother had. Unfortunately, they actually tried to incorporate what I like to call ""straightening-out"" into my therapy at one point. I eventually left the program shortly after one of the male staff was convicted of multiple counts of rape of one of the girls.

Now on to the rest of high school. I presented myself as a straight female throughout 10th-12th grade, because upon returning to my home state (in the Bible Belt) I learned really quick that high-school kids will rip you to shreds if they learn that your sexuality is ""out of the norm."" Needless to say, high school was an extremely difficult time for me.

But now, I've been out of high school for almost 2 years, and I've had some time to discover myself. I'm definitely going to keep my feminine appearance (at least for now) because I am able to get a lot of free things and favors because of it, not to mention I still live with my parents (I do still cross-dress on occasion, though).

But I'm not sure if I'm genderqueer or what. I've been told by some of my female friends that the way I act can be extremely masculine, or at least not feminine. And sometimes I feel like I'm female, sometimes I feel like I'm male, and other times I feel like both, or neither.

I never really explored my gender during that time, or expressed it - I was very comfortable to just acknowledge that I felt this way, but I would occasionally have periods of dysphoria. A few months ago, I moved to a new city, and ever since have been experiencing gender dysphoria very frequently. I would see women on the train or the street that fit my aesthetic/style, and would feel attraction; but as time went on, I started to feel like that feeling was lesser so attraction, but perhaps envy. Dysphoria became a pretty constant thing for me, and I started to think might be a girl. I talked to friends and roommates, who all encouraged me to experiment as I saw comfortable; my nails are now always painted (although playing guitar makes them  chip almost instantly), I regularly wear tights under my jeans, and I've started shaving my legs. My family and larger group of friends is aware of this, and don't seem to mind/notice. Within the closer circle that were aware of my dysphoria, I occasionally wear the couple dresses and skirts I have, and go by they/them pronouns. With every step I've taken - shaving, painting nails, wearing dresses - I've felt very comfortable with the results. That said, I've still never really felt a desire to present 100% feminine; I liked how I looked as a dude in a dress with painted nails and stubble. Earlier today, however, I took off my shirt, and I caught myself thinking how the image I saw would be better with breasts. I don't really know what that means, but I thought about it and figured it was as good a reason as any to experiment with presenting even more feminine than I have.   
Unfortunately, I'm aware I have some very masculine features - a very broad jaw and generally defined face for instance. Some of my features, however, like my weak shoulders and hourglass figure, can be interpreted as more feminine. So, TL;DR, do you guys think I could pass for feminine? I couldn't really pick one picture, so have a bunch:

I never really explored my gender during that time, or expressed it - I was very comfortable to just acknowledge that I felt this way, but I would occasionally have periods of dysphoria. A few months ago, I moved to a new city, and ever since have been experiencing gender dysphoria very frequently. I would see women on the train or the street that fit my aesthetic/style, and would feel attraction; but as time went on, I started to feel like that feeling was lesser so attraction, but perhaps envy. Dysphoria became a pretty constant thing for me, and I started to think might be a girl. I talked to friends and roommates, who all encouraged me to experiment as I saw comfortable; my nails are now always painted (although playing guitar makes them  chip almost instantly), I regularly wear tights under my jeans, and I've started shaving my legs. My family and larger group of friends is aware of this, and don't seem to mind/notice. Within the closer circle that were aware of my dysphoria, I occasionally wear the couple dresses and skirts I have, and go by they/them pronouns. With every step I've taken - shaving, painting nails, wearing dresses - I've felt very comfortable with the results. That said, I've still never really felt a desire to present 100% feminine; I liked how I looked as a dude in a dress with painted nails and stubble. Earlier today, however, I took off my shirt, and I caught myself thinking how the image I saw would be better with breasts. I don't really know what that means, but I thought about it and figured it was as good a reason as any to experiment with presenting even more feminine than I have.   \nUnfortunately, I'm aware I have some very masculine features - a very broad jaw and generally defined face for instance. Some of my features, however, like my weak shoulders and hourglass figure, can be interpreted as more feminine. So, TL;DR, do you guys think I could pass for feminine?

Super queer, run an underground LGBT club at my school because they won't allow us to have one, the idea of 'other' sexualities and gender identities is not something new to me at all.  Thought I was just a tomboy all my life, but fleeting desires to just *try* passing as male about three times in the past two years. But since September, I've really been finding that I don't really feel male or female. 

Looking into this more myself, I think that I'm probably genderqueer/fluid/something. Sometimes I want to dress and act like a girl. Sometimes I want to dress and act like a guy but not necessarily pass. Sometimes I want to dress and act like guy and want to pass. Haven't found a label yet but labels aren't entirely necessary to me. I've talked to a few people about this and they are (nearly) all supportive.

I'm talking to some friends, I decided that I was going to start wearing and buying clothes that felt more like me. But this means I have to try on and buy guys clothing. And wow... THAT IS REALLY STRESSFUL. Finding clothes that fit well will be an issue in seeing because of my body type. But that's a bridge to cross at a later date. I'm looking into getting a binder which is also for a later date.

I'm the new Chair of the Diversity Committee for an LGBTQ running group in New York City. I'm trying to put together a policy for enshrining the rights of genderqueer athletes, and I was wondering if I could get your feedback on such a policy — what would it include?

So far, I have (1) the right to self-identify as any gender; and (2) the right to withhold your gender from race sorting forms; but I'm having difficulty trying to identify rights in competition. Some ideas I'm having resolve around having mixed sex/gender neutral teams, but I'm wondering if there's anything else I should add.

EDIT: Here's a link to the document, which you are all welcome to mark up and make edits to. I've redacted the name of the Organization from this draft because this is still very much a new idea in the brainstorming stages and it may end up not going anywhere; so I don't want to create any unusual publicity where people thing ""Oh wow this is going to actually happen!""

I had a fun dream the other day that got me thinking about non-binary pride. Although I personally struggle with being proud of my gender, I am on my way to becoming a teacher, and I worry that my future genderqueer students (however few there may be) may not feel as good about themselves as they should. I realized that if I were to teach my 13-year-old self, I would not know what to say or do to make myself proud of who I was.

Now, I know that I could probably do a decent job convincing a genderqueer student that there is nothing wrong with them, or, at least, I have ideas.

That would have squashed some anxiety. :D) However, I am not just interested in making students feel less bad; I want them to feel good about being non-binary. This may seem a little contradictory, but I think there is a real difference between not feeling ashamed of who you are and feeling proud of who you are. I think the difference is evident when someone is not afraid to come out as genderqueer versus when someone wants to advertise that they are genderqueer. I want students to not just *not worry* about who they are. I want them to *celebrate* who they are.

I feel like this is a conundrum for the queer/LGBT+ community in general, hence pride parades and so on. However, I would prefer to hear something genderqueer specific.

2015-01-25 20:28:25,2tn9dv,5,4,"Hey all,
I'm trying to find someone who's been through this before. 

When I was a child, I was pretty agender. I identified as not-female. I never identified as male (but growing up in a small town in the 90s, that was never a possibility anyway). When puberty hit, I started to hate myself. There were some outside factors, but the biggest one was that I didn't want to be female. I didn't want to be seen as female. I hated it. I still do.

I get really moody for 2-3 weeks of the month. I can feel the effects of female hormones 2 weeks before my period. It's manageable then, but it's completely unbearable 7-10 days before my period and 3-4 days after it starts. I've talked to doctors about this. They've put me on different kinds of BC, which just made me slightly crazy all the time instead of very crazy most of the time. I tried antidepressants and I ended up with permanent, sometimes debilitating anxiety, so I'm not taking anything like that again. 

When I first got my period, and for a lot of my early adulthood, I would have done anything to have my ovaries removed. I now know they won't take your ovaries without putting you on some kind of hormone. So I'm thinking about T.

The problem is, I don't want to be male. I don't identify as male. I could live as a gay man, but I've lived all my life presenting as female. I don't know where to start. I don't have a support network. I tried going to a non-binary support group, I met a really cool person there, but I just don't have the energy to make friends right now. I don't really want to be male, and I don't really want to be in between. I know how society treats us, and I don't want that experience. I've already started dressing more masculine, got a male haircut, and I am treated completely different. I don't like it. I hate being seen as female but it's easier than this. Except for the inability to function 2-3 weeks out of 4.

But I keep thinking that T is the only way out of this. I just have to accept the consequences so I can get these toxic hormones in check. I'm afraid low-dose won't give me the experience of living with testosterone in my body, and I'm afraid the effects will be permanent if I go with a higher dose. My doctor is supportive, but clueless. I know everyone says it takes a while for the changes to be permanent, but I'm sensitive and aware of my body. I'd notice and I'd hate myself if the T didn't fix the moodiness.

So, anyone been through something similar?

throughout my life and ever since coming out, i've been having particularly bad mood swings (...to put it lightly. like, suicidal thoughts and anxiety x 10000 when i already have been diagnosed with a myriad of anxiety disorders) about a week or so before shark week rolls around.
since i'll be on very low dose t i can't imagine my ~monthly cycle~ will stop for a long time and i really am not sure that i can keep feeling this terrible for a solid quarter of my life basically.

In general, I'm talking about children aged 3-12 years old (once they're around middle school age, they start inserting discretion; i.e., they are more likely to go along with the gender that they think someone is going for). I  consider myself agender: no label seems right, but for whatever it's worth, I'm part of the AFAB group. Depending on hair length, I can pass as male or female. I successfully pulled off both in high school and college amongst people my age and older. What's weird is that even when adults are confident in gendering me female, children are reluctant. I've had dozens of embarrassed parents trying to correct their kids subtly. Just last month I had a child no older than four ask her mother very matter-of-factly why someone who wasn't a girl was allowed in a girl's bathroom. She was emphatic that I wasn't female, but she never called me male. Now maybe she thought I was male, but being the genderqueer person I am, it stayed in my mind that she never said ""boy"" or ""male"". She just kept repeating ""not a girl"".

So here's my question: on average, do you think children are honest sources and a good representation of what people really think for how well a person passes as a gender? Are their observations accurate feedback?

I keep going back and forth with this because part of me says, ""Yes! Young kids don't filter. What you see is what you get. If a five year old calls you sir, you must look male."" But then another voice pipes up and says, ""Children are inundated with gendering information: cartoons, toys, story lines in books and movies--there are a lot of messages for young kids about what it is to a girl or boy. Girls wear pink. Boys like sports. They see and hear these stereotypes all day long. If they called you sir, maybe you had an outfit on that wasn't pink, and they went with the simplest explanation that their young mind could provide. Maybe they went with the easiest answer. Girls wear make up and have purses. This person does not have make up or a purse. This person must be a man."" 

I keep going in circles, and I can't decide what's more true: that kids are accurate or easily misled?. Sure, there will be some kids in both categories, but as a whole, what description seems most realistic?

Since I started questioning my sexuality around a year ago there's been this confliction between my orientation and gender identity.

This got me wondering whether my confusion about my orientation caused me to question my gender identity also. Can anyone make sense of this or relate to it?

DMAB (Designated male at birth?) am I doing that right? I'm 22 and have lived and expressed myself as a guy ever since I was born. However when I was 11-13ish (I can't remember, sorry) I remember being home alone and dressing up in my sisters clothes. It felt right and I was very happy. 


I thought it may have just been something with a crossdressing thing of sorts, but recently I took the fetish part out of the equation and found I'm still really happy when i'm dressed in feminine clothing. Part of me feels complete, and happy when I'm dressed. 


I'm naturally very hairy and I'm quite a bit overweight compared to people my height (5'5 - 185lbs). I've grown to hate seeing my body hair on my chest, legs and face. While I hate seeing my hair on my face, up until last night I had quite the full beard. I'm not sure if it's because I'm lazy or just part of me hating it I'm like 'fuck it, i'll just let it hang'.


So more background, my sister is a lesbian and is married to admittedly a wonderful girl for her. It took me far longer than I'd like to admit to come to terms with that because we were raised in a conservative, christian family. I was taught that gay was a sin and such. I've become more liberal and I am all for peoples rights now. 

But... I'm struggling to come to terms with what my feelings mean about me. I'm having some sorts of an existential crisis. I feel like I want to be a girl 20% of the time, but the other 80% I'm all guy. 

Last night after I had talked to my non binary friend (how I learned of the terms/and started looking into it, it brought up more questions for myself) I shaved literally everything I could and I felt really really happy. 

What does this mean? Can someone help me with how I can get answers?

I'm sure a couple of you saw my previous post about my mother's unwillingness to use my preferred name and pronouns. This week my S/O and I were discussing the possibility of me going on T for a period of time to achieve a more androgynous/masculine look. However, as you all know, therapy is the first step in the process. 

So last night I was up, riddled with anxiety over what was happening. This morning my mother asked me what was up and I told her I need to go back to therapy, because I had so much on my mind. She asked the inevitable, ""What's going on?"". And so I let it out, I told her that I need to see a gender therapist to discuss things. She asked me bluntly, if I was going to change my gender to male. I took this opportunity to explain to her that gender is a spectrum and I fall somewhere in the middle, but not on either side comfortably. She was surprisingly receptive, even to the idea of me taking T for a period of time, she just wants me to happy it seems. I'm so relieved and so happy. I'm wondering what will happen if I mention going on T to my doctor on Monday (an unrelated appointment) and gauge his reaction. Apparently in my state there are ways to work around the 1 year waiting period? Not really sure how all that works. But I'm nonetheless excited to have her support. I feel like it will help my father be more accepting as well.

2015-01-31 00:03:58,2u95xd,13,5,"I looked around the sub but didn't find anything that really answered my question, so I hope it's okay for me to ask here.


I've wanted to change my name pretty much ever since I knew it was possible to do so. Both my names are overly feminine, and my middle name has religious connotations I do not agree with. For a while now I've been going by the name Sascha, a name I chose mainly because of its gender neutrality. (In French, my first language, Sacha is typically male and Sasha is typically female - to me, Sascha does a good job of being both.) Right now, my plan is to change my current middle name to Sascha and ""demote"" my current first name to my middle name (swapping them around) - though I don't like my current first name much, I figured it'd be convenient in the long run to at least keep it there.


Though I perceive it as neutral, I know that name is more commonly seen as a male name. Could this cause me trouble when I change my name? Is there a possibility that my name change would just be seen as ""look at the silly girl who wants a boy's name"" and be rejected? It's probably a silly thing to get worried about... I'd just like to know what to expect and how to prepare for this situation if there's a chance of it happening.


Thanks in advance to anyone who can help!

-I am biologically male.
-I don't really identify with typical male stereotypes, but I do not identify with any female either. However, I do lean a little more to the male side. (this is where I am confused. Am I agender if I don't identify with either, but am totally cool being considered a male (even though I don't fit the typical male stereotypes) Or dies that make me non-binary?)
-People use he/they pronouns for me. Are he pronouns agender?
-I do am not genderfluid, I have never felt like a girl and have never felt like more of a guy than usual.
-I dress/ act androgynous. If you only saw my clothes/ saw the way I acted, (other than my deep voice) you wouldn't be able to tell if I was male or female.

Less important facts:
-I unintentionally act a little feminine. I like cute things, and care about how I dress. I do not dress female or act female on purpose though.
-I'm asexual with a preference for girls.

I was born male with male parts but an intersex spectrum genetic disorder. I took testosterone from when I was 9 to when I was 18. I never was hypermasculine and always felt way more femme so at 20 I started taking estrogen and transitioned to female.

However its 6 years later, Im almost 27 and I dont really feel overly feminine, Some days I like to be femme but others I like to be androgynous.

I prefer female pronouns and I have a name that is ethnic and very feminine in my culture but most people seem to think is very androgynous.

Nope.
