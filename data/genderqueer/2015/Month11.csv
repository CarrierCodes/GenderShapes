I know autogynephilia and autoandrophilia are despised terms, so I'll use ""cross-dreaming"" instead.  There are people who don't have dysphoria about their physical body, or their assigned gender, most of the time.  But when it comes to sex, they do.


Although these people are not genderqueer, I don't think it's right for us to say ""oh, they *only* suffer in one aspect of their lives; we suffer in all aspects, therefore, they aren't like us.  They *just* have a fetish; we have a whole identity that's not recognized as legitimate.

Because, their sexual identities are also not seen as legitimate.  We should be seeing these people as allies in the fight for individual expression and legitimacy of all identities.

I'm 17. I'm female physically. And for most of my life, I was perfectly happy being a girl. Then I got a bit older. I became a teenager. I discovered that things aren't in black-and-white when it comes to gender and sexuality. I cross-dressed as a man (Wolverine) for dress up day at school. I liked it.

I started having doubts. I wavered between being suicidal and dysphoric, and being perfectly happy with life. The depressions were usually related to realising I would never be good enough for the boys I liked. 

And I'm still wavering today. Every few months, I experience an intense longing to be a man. I'm currently feeling that now. But apart from that, all the time I want to dress in suits and look sharp. Any man looks sharp in a well-fitted suit. I want to cut my hair short, just like David Tennant. 

I fucking hate being short and squat. I don't understand why anyone could find women attractive. We're weak, small, less useful. But I still find the female figure attractive? But not so much with interacting with other people. It's men that make me breathless, who make me excited and happy. 

I guess I also have some beef with my height. I have had for a while. I despise being 5 foot nothing and having to wear heels just to feel normal. All part and package of being born female. Hah.

I don't know what I am. So I've come here. It's my first post here. I'm sorry if I've used wrong terminology or offended someone. I don't mean to hate on women either or generalise. I'm in one of those dark holes right now and I really hate everything about being a woman right now.

AFAB. I've been dealing with depression since I was 10. I went on meds in 2011 after feeling in a very low self-loathing place, and was pretty well controlled after that. 

However, I also have a lot of problems with my ovaries leading to intermittent debilitating pain - my specialist suspects endometriosis. The only way I've been able to manage the pain is through hormonal birth control. I've taken 4 kinds (Yaz, Ortho, Loestrin, and currently Nuvaring.) All of which severely mess up my depression. 

I've taken a really bad turn over the last couple months. I've been hitting and scratching myself and I purged on halloween and the day after. But I'm afraid of choosing between my mental health and my physical health.

I know that I have trans and genderqueer friends for whom a change in hormones had an impact on their mental health, and I'm wondering if the hormonal impact has anything to do with that. I don't know... I feel like I'm just rambling now.

I'm worried that having that ovary removed may end up being the only course of action and then I'd be taking estrogen anyway... god I don't even know...

I wrote a few lines recently, about how I feel those days, and before, and about my fears for the future. It is not exactly a ""classicist"" poem, but more meant to sound like a rap or a slam (there's no fix length of verses for example). I would love you guys to read it and tell me what you think of that basically :) maybe I could use it for anything, tell me that too :D 

Also, it's not copyrighted, but please, don't copy/paste it somewhere and say you wrote it, it's just not how people should do. You can ask if you really like it, but don't assume I'm ok with it (even if I doubt it's anywhere near good).

Anyways, here it's is:


In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth;
it was to the strictest universe He was giving birth;
the light, the dark, the liquid and the dirt;
 
God created the man, but quick gave him his lady;
and here he was perfect and in harmony;
and here it was the life, and it was binary.

But ""hey"" here I am, like a fool;
without even knowing it I am breaking the rule; 
I was thrown in the sea, and told not to drown;
but this burden is now constantly keeping me down;

I can't do anything, but just accept it;
as if it were easy, like if I had a choice;
now there is this sensation to just not fit;
I am trying to shout but I would first need a voice.

In my body I feel claustrophobic;
it might seem like I am fine but really, i am getting sick;
just like Heracles who went to hell and came back;
I am closer to Satan, but try to climb that track back;

This is the struggle between the real and the chosen;
the first one I really feel was stolen;
mister Hyde is the hidden while Jekyll is the real evil;
one, a true Armageddon, I am trying to win the battle.

But I am alone in that wrong body;
The only one who knows, I am lonely;
Some of course give me compassion;
But as hard as they try, only I can take action.

And it is hard, really it's devastating;
All around me I have help, and understanding;
But unfortunately they can't do anything;
I am the only one who can save me from drowning.

I am transgender;
Born as a male, but always been just a pretender;
I see the two genders as such a splendor;
But ultimately lost, and ready to surrender.",genderqueer,"I made a kind of poem, would you read and give thoughts please?

-----------------------

Hey. I'm AMAB, I recently turned 18, and over the last couple of months I've been wondering about my gender a lot. It first started in May and has continued for most of the time since then. I first came to the conclusion that I was simply a trans girl (even posting a 'coming out'/introduction post on /r/MtF). Almost as soon as I came to that conclusion, the doubts started to come back and I felt more like a gay guy (my attraction to men is something I've repressed since early puberty and am only slowly getting used to the fact that I am not a straight guy after all). After that (about a month ago now) I started to identify as genderfluid. That word seemed to make the most sense to me - the first time I saw the word used in a positive light it seemed to fit me, which just binary trans didn't seem to do as much - but now I'm having these doubts again.

I noticed what I *think* are changes in my internal gender. (Note that I can't really play around too much with gender at the moment and probably won't be able to for a while.) **Right now, it seems my genders are on a spectrum between feminine guy and female... which is where the confusion sets in.** All of those are more feminine then anything else. I've also been having a lot more dysphoria these past couple of days and when a family member came out with a shirt that was too big for her, I put it on and it felt... comfy. Like no other clothes have before. It felt like *my* clothes. It was a really cute shirt... I've wanted to wear dresses, skirts and the like for so long but this was an experience like no other. **That has basically led me to think that I'm simply a trans girl in denial about her gender.** (Also: on pronouns, I seem to prefer female pronouns, regardless of internal gender. That may be a problem.) 

I don't know what I am anymore. **Sometimes I feel like a femme guy, and sometimes my dysphoria is so strong that I *need* to transition, like any other trans person.** On top of that, I was scared to identify as non-binary for a while, and I think it's because of an anxiety of hate crimes and people invalidating my gender. I'm quite a timid and not-very-confrontational person and I know that I won't be able to fight as much. I felt like to survive in this cruel, cruel world I needed to be a binary gender. I'm also kinda worried about not really being genderfluid, and just being trans in denial. Or vice versa. (A comment I saw on another subreddit hasn't helped this very much.) I also think that my family will get confused if I come out as genderfluid/non-binary, and won't believe me, or that non-binary genders actually exist. I'm not ready to move out, and I can't really crossdress or anything like that here... (although, I have a feeling they already think I'm a closeted cross-dresser and to be quite honest I have no real problems identifying as such a lot of the time, which further adds to the confusion.) I think that the real cause of my confusion is that **while genderfluid feels like it *should* be me, I don't feel like it is my identity very often.** I feel like a trans girl, or a feminine guy, not just genderfluid. I have an obsession of labelling myself and I'm not sure that I'm ever going to just 'be me' without a label, as much as I would like to. All this confusion is doing my head in at the moment, and I suppose the purpose of this post is mostly to get it all off my chest. The other purpose is just a kinda ""DAE?"" sort of thing. If you've managed to read this incoherency this far, thankyou &lt;3

----------------

TL;DR: AMAB, thought I was binary trans, now switch between femme guy and full on female but don't feel genderfluid, super confused about my identity.

2015-11-10 11:17:31,3s9efg,6,4,"Hi everyone, i'm new here. So, for some time now i have been trying to better understand what exactally i am, if trans, non-binary, just a feminine guy, or something else. And i thought it wouldn't hurt post about myself here, to see what others think about my situation. But first, let me just say: english is not my first language. I will do my best, but i will probably make a lot of misspelings (heck, i probably alreadly did a lot). I hope you all can still understand.

Now for my problem... Over the last couple years/months, i notice that i really have... some issues with my male traits. I absolutly HATE body-hair (and to my [un]luck, i have a LOT... thanks genetics ¬¬'), and i also don't want to grow muscles (i'm very thin and want to say like that). Also, i would want a flat belly (i don't want a 6 packs or anything, just want it flat).

And i also notice i would like to have many tipically woman traits. Like long hair, tight waist, little muscle, a bigger but... And i also preffer woman's clothes to men's one (honestly, if i could i would only wear woman clothes, men's ones are just... boring).

But all that said, i don't really have any problem with my genitalia, and i also don't know if i would want breats (maybe some REALLY small ones, MAYBE). And on top of that... people who i have talked have told me to figure out what gender i feel like, but i can't really understand what it means to feel being a gender.

Over the last couple years/months, i notice that i really have... some issues with my male traits. I absolutly HATE body-hair (and to my [un]luck, i have a LOT... thanks genetics ¬¬'), and i also don't want to grow muscles (i'm very thin and want to say like that). Also, i would want a flat belly (i don't want a 6 packs or anything, just want it flat).\n\nAnd i also notice i would like to have many tipically woman traits. Like long hair, tight waist, little muscle, a bigger but... And i also preffer woman's clothes to men's one (honestly, if i could i would only wear woman clothes, men's ones are just... boring).\n\nBut all that said, i don't really have any problem with my genitalia, and i also don't know if i would want breats (maybe some REALLY small ones, MAYBE). And on top of that... people who i have talked have told me to figure out what gender i feel like, but i can't really understand what it means to feel being a gender.

2015-11-13 05:33:02,3smpyw,2,7,"Hello there /r/genderqueer, I’ve been lurking around a bit lately and just want to get my feelings and thoughts out there and see if anyone has gone through similar things or guide me in the direction of figuring out myself. Here’s a little background on myself: I am a 19 year old heterosexual male college student and I feel like transition is not what I would ever want to do.

My earliest memories of crossdressing go back to when I was about 12-13 years old.  I can’t really recall what inspired me to try dressing for the first time but I remember once I started I kept going at it.  I have always been a relatively small guy (5’6” and very skinny) so I just stole clothing from my younger sister (1.5 years younger) since she has always been the same size as me in everything (even feet).  But from the beginning until recently crossdressing had always seemed to be more of a sexual thing for me.  I was always easily aroused as soon as I dressed and it was 99% a thing I did for masturbation.  For the other 1% of the time I would be either lounging around in a dress and playing video games or something while my family was away or just trying on different outfits for the fun of it.  

After having kept this side of me as a secret for like 7 years , I finally chose to come out to two close female friends (one of which is an ex) two months ago.  I didn’t go to much in depth but gave them a pretty basic rundown (crossdressing but not the whole gender questioning side). They both appeared supportive and didn’t really seem to care but for some reason I was kind of disappointed with their reactions even though they had pretty good reactions. Then about a month later I somewhat accidentally came out (just about crossdressing) to a pretty close male friend after smoking a little too much but his reaction was good.  At this point I was still feeling depressed because even though I had told three different people, I felt uncomfortable really talking about it with them. I feel as if I may be annoying the first female friend, with my ex I have sensed slight disapproval and I just feel very uncomfortable talking about it with my male friend.  I decided at this point to come out (both crossdressing and gender questioning) to one more person who I knew identified as agender and bisexual thinking that I may be able to somewhat relate with him since he also is outside of the binary gender.  He was the most supportive of all my friends and said he was willing to talk about it with me at any time but still for some reason I find myself uncomfortable talking about it with him.

For some reason I keep feeling the need to open up to more people but at the same time I don’t want to because I’m kind of scared.  I know that like most of my close friends who don’t know yet as well as my family would be supportive of me but for some reason I still just can’t.  I feel bad when I’m saying this considering the fact that so many genderqueer people/crossdressers live in much more conservative families and have to deal with much rougher situations. 

Now when it comes to gender, I always have seen myself as a male that is very feminine but at times I can sense a much stronger feminine side to myself than masculine side.  I had never really thought too deeply about this stuff but since I have done so, I have really started to think I might be genderfluid. At times I feel masculine but also there are times where I act much more feminine.  Examples include In high school I swam so unfortunately I have very broad shoulders which at times I wish would just go away but sometimes I don’t seem to mind.  Another example is my body/facial hair which I most of the time just wish would all just go away.  I feel as if at times I believe women have much more desirable bodies than men as well as get to openly express their feelings much more and sometimes that upsets me.

I have never really be exactly sure on what to classify myself as and I currently have been trying to explore myself and figure out who I am.  From the beginning until just recently, I sorta just tried to forget about this side of me and think “I am just your normal male with a slight feminine side” denying to myself that I was a crossdresser or gender fluid or anything of that sort.  But after restraining this side of me and beginning to open up a little for friends, I keep having this slight feeling that I kind of want to open up even further but at the same time I want to figure myself out more first.  Lately I have been researching a lot into what it means to be genderqueer, transgender as well as I have finally started buying my own women’s clothing and casually wearing it around my room (when my roommate is out).

But about two weeks ago, I woke up one day and suddenly my mind just started rebelling against me. I was anxious and feeling depressed and the only conclusions I could come up with is ""it must be my gender"" even though there wasn't much evidence to support the notion. And I'm sure at least a few of you know how anxiety likes to take ideas and just run away with them. Ever since then, I keep putting myself and my gender under a great deal of scrutiny which has been making me anxious and stressed out. Every day my mind is just coming at me from all angles with thoughts like ""you're a man"", ""you're a woman"", ""both"", ""neither"", etc. If I get so much as a tingle in my side or a slight pain in my genital area, alarms go off in my head screaming ""DYSPHORIA"" even though there hasn't been any point during all this where I truly felt like my body, appearance, and genitals are wrong. It sounds silly, I know, but this is what I've been experiencing and I don't know what to do about it. For years, I've been well informed and accepting of the ins and outs of being trans/gender nonconforming and very open to the idea that maybe one day I'll fall somewhere under the trans umbrella. I was never big on gender stereotypes either, prior to this, I was perfectly okay with stepping outside the expectations that come with being a ""man"" and doing things like taking on more ""feminine"" mannerisms and painting my nails, etc. But since all of this, things I was perfectly okay with before seem scary.

Phase 1 involved coming out to close friends and people I trust. Like the title implies, I got to everyone on my Phase 1 list.

A few things:

- Everyone I've told has been so great. Some were very effusive and congratulatory, others were more laid back, but everyone has been really supportive.

- Other than offering support, the most common response when I told people was something along the lines of, ""yeah, I'm not surprised."" Which I was taken aback by at first but eventually I realized that was great. One thing I was anxious about with coming out is that people wouldn't believe me. That so many people were so unsurprised with the news eased those particular anxieties.

- Some people have offered to help me learn How To Girl (which is great because gosh this is confusing and intimidating).

- A few people I told are trans or gender nonconforming themselves, and that's made a lot of difference over the past few weeks. One of the last people I told is a trans woman and literally one of the first things she asked me, right after name/pronouns, was ""are you safe?"". I kinda teared up at that? (And yes, I'm safe, I'm fine.)

- I didn't do it consciously, but the other day I counted up the number of people on my Phase 1 list and realized [I inadvertently made a *West Wing* reference](http://westwing.wikia.com/wiki/17_People).

- I feel exceptionally lucky to have friends this understanding and supportive. And I also feel sad because I wish everyone had the kind of people I have in their corner.

2015-11-17 22:29:03,3t7thj,11,36,"So this mini-story is accurately summed up by the title above.

In amongst all my gender-peculiarity, high heels are definitely something sitting in the look-but-don't touch box, and for a whole heap of reasons.

I have a friend of mine who I am out to who says anything I feel like doing I should just do and not care what people may think, but that is just straight-up on another planet from my comfort zone, and that pretty much rules it out before I consider other factors.

Anyway, another friend of mine had a frankly genius theme for his birthday celebratory drinks, which was to wear something weird or unusual. I will already wear eyeliner and/or nail polish, so I was looking for a way to take advantage of being able to experiment with a different form of gender expression, and thus the heels idea was born. I said to myself I wasn't going to do it, but then lack of a better idea, the date approaching fast, and a pure coincidence of several people suggesting it (without knowing I had planned it) talked me back into the idea, and from somewhere I found the courage to go ahead.

So thus I did, and I have to say, it was great. The response was really positive - almost surprisingly so. I had the excuse of the occasion to fall back on as to why I was wearing 5½ heels, but there was definitely a level of release in being able to do it and not having my fears of ridicule realised. However, I'm not sure it's broken those fears for a repeat performance without some sort of reason why.

For the vast majority of my life, I thought I was a cis female, and it wasn't until I started lurking here a few times that I began to feel temporarily agender after reading some of the posts here (I've read that gender changes can sometimes be triggered by random events; in my case, it was reading about others' experiences about being GQ). The first couple of times this happened, the gender change only bothered me a little and when I woke up the next morning, I would forget about it and I would default back to female shortly afterward.

However, when I went to this subreddit a couple of weeks ago and started to feel agender again, I started freaking out a little bit, and started to experience severe dysphoria. I wished that I was cis and all I wanted was to revert back to female permanently. For two thirds of this week, I was feeling mostly female, but last night when I was agender, I started to think of other pronouns and then suddenly, my gender identity became a shitstorm, cycling through agender, gender neutral/neutrois, female, non-binary. and skoliogender. This shitstorm really, *really* freaked me out, a lot. I cried a little bit because I wanted this shitstorm to stop and I just wanted to be female.

I realized earlier this week that I need to accept my gender identity, but I don't know how. Dysphoria prevents me from being ok with it.

I used to lurk this sub a few months ago and gave up on my gender identity (FAAB) until I took a class exploring gender identity which sort of forced me to re-examining it. I'm cutting this post short because I'm not in a good place right now..

Anyway, I came out to my therapist as trans* today.. but she's not really experienced in these things but was very supportive and happy for me. I cried tears of joy. Thing is.. I don't think I'm FtM. I'm FtN.. Female to Neutral.

I feel so alone in this. r/asktransgender is basically all trans women.. and I don't feel like I fit in r/ftm. 

I would want to take low doses of T and would consider top surgery if I could ever afford it..

Anyway, any advice is appreciated. Sorry this post is short/lacks details, I'm just feeling really alone in this right now. I feel like people will never accept me as FtN and will just ask when I'll be FtM.. I don't know.

2015-11-23 20:39:03,3tzjq9,13,2,"So I have been struggling with confusion for the past month. I am a 20 year old male and lately ive been wondering if I want to be a girl. This question came out of left field and I'm really struggling to understand whats going on. It first started when a question popped into my head, ""Am I Transgendered?"". I have been worrying about this question and its causing me great distress. It's the question thats bothering me because I can't decide who I am. It feels like im losing myself.

I've never entertained this thought before and it is scaring me. The more I research the more unsure I become. I cant really say that I have dysphoria because I am a very hairy guy, and I like this about myself. I have a beard and I love the way it looks on me. The only problem I've had with my penis is it being too small. (I have always wished I had a bigger penis). It feels like the voice that keeps questioning isn't ""me"". Everytime I drink I realize that I am just worrying for no reason and I like being a man. However the next day the questioning starts again and it become even more intense.

It feels like there is a voice in my head I can not reason with. I sometimes ""snap out of it"" and realize I am a man and like being a man. However eventually i keep coming back to the questioning. I've always been one to think in black and white and for a time thought I was gay. However I came to accept that I am bisexual and am just attracted to more feminine men. I just hope I can get some sort of advice with what I am dealing with. 

Edit: I should also add that I have Gyno (male breasts). This has always been a thing of great shame and i've had intrusive thoughts of cutting them off. When I think about this it makes me realize that I dont want breast.

2015-11-27 04:25:31,3uferg,16,5,"TW: Doctors, depression vibes (sorry for the length)
I’m 19 and AFAB, and have identified as “gay” (I’m uncomfortable with the word “lesbian”) for a long time, but am just having an awful time trying to figure out how I feel about my gender. I have always identified with “butch” to some extent, but it doesn’t sit quite right with me. The whole thing is confusing because I just cannot wrap my mind around how sex assigned at birth has anything to do with how I would act or feel about my gender. I just cannot understand why the two are related, at least in my case.
      But on the other hand, I feel horribly distressed (possibly dysphoric) about some characteristics of my body that are associated with my assigned sex. It is extremely troubling to me, and I live in constant fear of having to go to a doctor for these secondary sex characteristics or problems that they might cause. I also don’t think I would ever be able to have sex with my body, partially because I am so uncomfortable but also because then I might be more inclined to go to a doctor about them (more diseases that could affect me.) I am so uncomfortable that the thought of another person seeing (much less interacting) with these parts (a doctor more so than a partner). I do have an anxiety disorder (GAD or OCD, not entirely sure- the diagnosis changes with each appointment), which does make these worries more extreme. It’s just so confusing because I don’t think these parts have anything to do with how I feel about how gender, but I feel so uncomfortable with these parts and I have a hard time believing that it has nothing to do with gender. I’m not so much concerned with how people perceive my gender because of them (although I do think about it), but their very presence on my body is extremely distressing to me. I don’t know if I would feel any better if I was AMAB, though.
I don’t know what to make of all of this. I want to experiment with different presentations and see how that feels. In terms of pronouns, I don’t completely feel comfortable with she/her/hers pronouns, but I haven’t been referred to with anything else really so it’s hard to gauge. In the same way other gendered words make me feel- I have never experienced anything else. I have been referred to with he pronouns in public (I have short hair and I guess I have an androgynous appearance), and this makes me somewhat uncomfortable, but partially because I am not intending to be read this way. I would ask friends to try out different pronouns, but I am not sure I am ready to bring that up. I do go to some trans clubs at my college, but it is hard to experiment with pronouns there (but I state my pronouns as they/them.)  I do not identify as a man, but saying “I identify as a woman” makes me extremely uncomfortable (more than saying I identify as a man.)  When I imagine what my body should look like, I see my chest as flat but I have a hard time really pinpointing anything else. The image of how my body looks now is very upsetting to me. It’s more the body than the social aspects that are troubling, but both definitely play a role.
I’m just so lost and sad about this. It has been affecting me more after a medication change, and I just cannot imagine the rest of my life feeling so lost or with this body that I grow to fear and hate more and more each day. Has anyone experienced anything like this? Why, if sex and gender do not seem related, might my assigned sex be so distressing to me? Is there anything I can do to feel better? I’m not necessarily trying to pinpoint a label for my gender, just some insight if anybody can offer some. I’m sorry this is so long and all over the place, and if there are any typos.

I have always identified with “butch” to some extent, but it doesn’t sit quite right with me. The whole thing is confusing because I just cannot wrap my mind around how sex assigned at birth has anything to do with how I would act or feel about my gender. I just cannot understand why the two are related, at least in my case.\n      But on the other hand, I feel horribly distressed (possibly dysphoric) about some characteristics of my body that are associated with my assigned sex. It is extremely troubling to me, and I live in constant fear of having to go to a doctor for these secondary sex characteristics or problems that they might cause. I also don’t think I would ever be able to have sex with my body, partially because I am so uncomfortable but also because then I might be more inclined to go to a doctor about them (more diseases that could affect me.) I am so uncomfortable that the thought of another person seeing (much less interacting) with these parts (a doctor more so than a partner). I do have an anxiety disorder (GAD or OCD, not entirely sure- the diagnosis changes with each appointment), which does make these worries more extreme. It’s just so confusing because I don’t think these parts have anything to do with how I feel about how gender, but I feel so uncomfortable with these parts and I have a hard time believing that it has nothing to do with gender. I’m not so much concerned with how people perceive my gender because of them (although I do think about it), but their very presence on my body is extremely distressing to me. I don’t know if I would feel any better if I was AMAB, though.\nI don’t know what to make of all of this. I want to experiment with different presentations and see how that feels. In terms of pronouns, I don’t completely feel comfortable with she/her/hers pronouns, but I haven’t been referred to with anything else really so it’s hard to gauge. In the same way other gendered words make me feel- I have never experienced anything else. I have been referred to with he pronouns in public (I have short hair and I guess I have an androgynous appearance), and this makes me somewhat uncomfortable, but partially because I am not intending to be read this way. I would ask friends to try out different pronouns, but I am not sure I am ready to bring that up. I do go to some trans clubs at my college, but it is hard to experiment with pronouns there (but I state my pronouns as they/them.)  I do not identify as a man, but saying “I identify as a woman” makes me extremely uncomfortable (more than saying I identify as a man.)  When I imagine what my body should look like, I see my chest as flat but I have a hard time really pinpointing anything else. The image of how my body looks now is very upsetting to me. It’s more the body than the social aspects that are troubling, but both definitely play a role.\nI’m just so lost and sad about this. It has been affecting me more after a medication change, and I just cannot imagine the rest of my life feeling so lost or with this body that I grow to fear and hate more and more each day.

Grammatically, the pronoun ""they"" is conjugated as a plural verb. Like saying ""They *are*"" rather than ""They *is*"", the way you would say ""He *is*"". In english at least, this doesn't seem so bad, since we really don't have that many verbs with weird conjugations like you would have in romance languages. 

But the fact that the verb ""to be"" is one of our most used verbs makes using ""they"" in casual conversation feel weird. I'm by no means a grammar nazi, so this has nothing to do with me being pretentious.

So, in all of your experiences, how do you feel about this? Do you feel awkward when using it as well? Does it get easier the more you work on it? Or is this why some people prefer xe and hir, because you can conjugate like a normal singular pronoun?

I ask mostly because a good friend of mine recently came out as GQ and wants they pronouns. I'm more than happy to do it, but I feel like I stumble over my words a lot and accidentally end up using a gendered pronoun because it's awkward. I easily switch between he and she, but I feel like I need a lot more practice this time around, so I wonder. What advice do you all have?

I think using one pronoun for everyone would be so much easier, like in Tagalog.

I'm biologically female. My parents have never been ones to enforce any traditional gender roles on me/my siblings, so since I was a child, I could pursue whatever interested me and dress however I liked, free of any kind of pressure to conform to anything.

When I was around ten, I started wearing men's shirts (I was a tall kid) and when I was thirteen, I started wearing entirely men's clothes (which I still do) whenever I could. My parents had no issues with this (though my mom would sometimes complain about how ""men's clothes don't fit you because they're cut for a male body""). I bought my first men's suit two years ago, when I was sixteen, and for the first time in my life, I fell in love with ""dressing up""--wearing formal clothes. I've been drawing over my thin, neat eyebrows to make them thicker and scruffier since I was ten because I feel they make me look more handsome; I loved every inch of my body hair, which I've always kept.

I've gained a lot of weight since school became more stressful for me (stress-eater); it's given me a huge waist to hip ratio. I hate it. I've hated it since it happened. It's the major motivator for me to regain muscle and drop weight; I want to reduce how feminine I look. I don't bind--haven't gotten around to buying a binder--but it's incredibly appealing to me, and it's only a matter of having some spare cash, really.

I don't care what people call me--she, he, miss, mister, lady, man, whatever--but I, myself, cannot bring myself to call myself ""she"" or ""miss""; I choke--I physically pause involuntarily when referring back to myself as such--on the word because I don't feel like it really... belongs? I don't like being ""pretty"" or ""beautiful""; I prefer ""handsome"", if anything, though I don't like my appearance talked about at all because I feel it's such a huge disconnect between how I look and how I ""should"" look--buffer, taller, with less hips and more shoulders, more stereotypically masculine.

I've never questioned my gender before because... I've never really cared? I never paid attention to gender before I saw all of the nonbinary, trans, etc. people here and on tumblr and on other social media outlets and made some trans and nonbinary friends in person; for me, I wasn't a boy or a girl or anything, I was just me, and I never knew that I was supposed to feel an affinity for one gender or the other or any label at all, really.

I'd wouldn't call myself trans because I feel like that doesn't fit either; I've been calling myself ""very, very butch"" for a long time, sans ""man"" or ""woman"" or even ""person"", but I feel like even that doesn't fit anymore given my feelings and I just...
