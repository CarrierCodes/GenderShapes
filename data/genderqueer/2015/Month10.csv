2015-10-01 19:50:29,3n54dp,0,4,"A wee while ago I read an article about a genderqueer peoson on Another sub... It was the first time I had ever heard the term, and I identified with it immediately. 

I am identified male at birth, but I have never felt typically male. I've always been skinny, with long hair. AS a teenager, this made me self-conscious, and I tried to act hyper-masculine. I passed off the hair as being a heavy metal thing, but really I just liked long hair. Now that I am in my thirties, I am much more comfortable with who I am, and not being typically male didn't bother me, even before I found a label for it.   

But still, finding a label felt pretty cool. I thought it over for about a week before telling my girlfriend. Her reaction was not as I had hoped at first. At first she told me that, being straight, it would be a problem for our relationship if I wasn't male. I told her that it was more about finding who I was, rather than transitioning to something else; she accepted that, but I could tell she was a little uncomfortable. That was then, though, in the weeks since, she seems to have gotten more comfortable. This is helped by the fact that we've been together for a long time, I've never acted like anything other than who I am, so a new label doesn't really change anything.   

She did say something, though. She asked why, if I feel this way, I'd never let her paint my nails. I told her it was because when she asked, I assumed she was joking, so I humoured the joke, by acting in a ""manly"" way about the proposition. She accepted that. Then she asked if she could paint my nails the next day. I let her, and I've had painted nails ever since.   

painted nails, I took as tacit acceptance.   

Now I have started looking at where I could take it. I have always felt like I have a feminine body type, which I like (since being an adult, anyway); I've been conflicted between liking showing it off, and being scared to. I have a couple of deep-V t-shirts, that I think were made for women, but most of my tops are schlubby and male. Same with trousers. I have exactly one pair of figure-hugging jeans, which are worn through from being worn a lot. And as much as I would love a more feminine wardrobe, I just don't have the energy for one.   

There's also the job situation. I have just started a new job, and I really need to be taken seriously there. I have had a really bad few years with employment, and so I am a little justifiably paranoid about losing it. So I dress like a professional man, but it really depresses me going in every day in loose-fitting slacks and a button down.   

I also get lonely working long hours there, so I would appreciate someone to talk to. This is an alt. I'll save the post to my regular account, so I'll be able to see comment replies (just not PMs). So, if you'd like to chat, comment below. I'd love to hear how you'd deal with this.   

While we're on the topic of sexual identity, I am also demisexual, and I do find myself attracted to androgynous people. That's important to my identity, but I couldn't find a way to fit it in otherwise.

Hi all.  This is long, but I wanted to include a lot to make sure I got the whole picture and situation.

So, I have this boss at work who is a very feminine lady.  Always dressed very nicely: pencil skirts, heels, everything color coordinated, nicely styled hair, the works. Very put together.

I, on the other hand, have more of a gender neutral presentation.  I'm always clean and my clothes are always washed and pressed, but I'm a nice khakis and polo shirt person.  I have [short hair](http://images.amcnetworks.com/amc.com/wp-content/uploads/mt-legacy/the-walking-dead/TWD-S2-Melissa-McBride-Interview-325.jpg). I don't wear heels or skirts because the work I do doesn't allow for that (shelving books, bending down and standing back up quickly), and also I don't like wearing them.

What I wear is definitely within dress code and no one else has a problem with it.  Other people (men and women) dress as casually or even more so than I do.  Yet any time this boss and I are working on something together, just the two of us, she always brings up the way I dress.

At first, it was phrased as constructive criticism.  Some of it was constructive and helpful, but the majority of it was not.  Example: ""Those pants you wear don't really look sufficiently professional."" I was wearing cargo pants.  At the time I had a low ranking but active job in which the cargo pants were acceptable.  Once I moved up in the company, I switched to more formal khakis. ""I'm not really sure you've thought through the image you're trying to project.""

Um, okay. Thanks.  A few months pass, I've gotten my promotion (which I heard through my former boss that she tried to block me from getting), and I've upgraded my wardrobe accordingly.  No comments, I thought everything was fine.

We are paired together to work a table for a few hours.  During this time, she tells me about when she was in middle school and she went through a phase where ""she wanted to be different from her sister, so she wore a lot of boy's clothes"" and ""didn't fix her hair,"" but she stopped because ""I was afraid of...(long pause)...giving off the wrong impression"" and pointedly looking away from me.

She repeatedly used the ""(long pause)...wrong impression"" about clothing repeatedly through the evening, even though I tried to redirect the conversation.

Y'all, I know what I look like.  I look like a soft butch/androgynous/what-have-you, and I'm working in a conservative area of the southern US.  But you know what? I'm good at my job, I dress professionally (if not very femme), and I maintain a professional, friendly demeanor at work.

I shrugged off her weird comments initially, but they've been getting more and more pointed.  Is this harassment?  If so, is there anything I can do about it?

I'm not out completely at work.  Some of my coworkers know, but my bosses are varying degrees of religious and I just don't bring it up.  And most of them don't either.

What do y'all think I should do?  I'm inclined to ignore it, but on the other hand I'm worried about it escalating.  Any advice is appreciated.

I\'ve considered doing so, if only because I\'d feel more comfortable seeing M on my papers instead of F.\n\nQuite frankly, I dislike both, but F just feels wrong to see, whereas M would be more ""eh, this\'ll do until I can get my real gender marker"". I live in a province that\'s so backwards and so far behind on simple things like trans rights that I fully expect we\'ll never be able to have a marker other than M or F... so I figure I might as well go with the lesser of two evils.\n\nI\'m looking forward to hearing (or rather, reading) what you all have to say.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'What do you do when it comes to legal gender markers?', 'created': 1443840836.0}"

Anyway, today I attented a small meeting, with people I don't know very well at all, but that I feel quite comfortable around and like. There was a new guy there and when he learned that my name is Eli he said "" wow, really? It is a pretty name. My son is named Eli. It's just not a very common name for girls to have here in Sweden"" and I explained that it's only a nickname, but that I don't like to be called by my old name, and then he added ""...If you are a girl!

2015-10-05 22:35:39,3nmssl,2,3,"Firstly, I just wanted to say hello. I am quite  a lurker on reddit. I tend to be as shy on the web as I am in real life. Lurking on this subreddit has shown me what a supportive and positive group of people are on here. So I thank all of you for that, but unfortunately I am going to share something kind of dark; not only because it's one of the few places I feel I can appropriately vent it, but that I feel many of you here could identify with it. 

Anyways, it basically comes down to this; after a lifetime of struggling with my gender and sexuality, I've essentially given up on any semblance of my true gender expression. It's a very long story to say how I've reached that decision. But  I can pretty much say that due to work, location, and family, as well as a variety of other circumstances, I feel resigned to basically take very important part of myself and lock it away. I'll just have to let it be a screaming little voice in the back of my head. I feel like I've just been crushed into the mold this world has selected for me. 

What has helped me greatly through my life in times like these is art and media, whether I'm creating it or consuming it. I'm pretty into death metal and my all time favorite band has recently released an album. One of the songs, called Abysmal, describes being stranded alone with nothing and no one. It's lyrics perfectly express how the part of me I'm abandoning feels right now. So while I can't say I'm offering anything that's feel good, I thought I'd share those lyrics since I know a lot of us can identify with the themes. Thanks to anyone who took the time to read all this. Here they go:

The world has turned and left me here
Alone with nothing but my fears
I feel the stares of ancient cracks
Mirror reflects just what I lack

I am standing here dying to be
To mean anything to anyone but me
I am naked now bereft of love's beginning
I am a shadow of what was

The victims of contempt
There will be nothing left
Secrets of my being are from me kept
There will be no resolve
For this wreck of nerves
Just to the ends of those
To the end that I deserve

I am standing here dying to be
To mean anything to anyone but me
I am naked now bereft of love's beginning
I am a shadow of what was
A shadow of what was
You are dead to me
I am dead to me
My pulse has stopped you see
-? -
And for eternity
As Satan laughs, we will burn forever
Scream abysmally

The world has turned and left me here
Alone with nothing but my fears
I feel the stares of ancient cracks
Mirror reflects just what I lack
I am alone
I am alone
I'll die alone
Beneath the bitter stone

I am standing here dying to be
To mean anything to anyone but me
I am naked now bereft of loves beginning
I am a shadow of what was
I'll tie this noose up just because
Such life ends abysmally

Hello my genderqueer siblings! So this is my first time ever posting a thing on reddit. Feels like a big moment

Anyway I've been asked to talk at a panel where they will be talking about non binary identities in sci fi. This looks like its a bigger deal than I thought I was signing up for so I thought I'd turn to you guys for help. 

So the title of the talk is ""genderqueerness as a marker of the other"" and the description is: ""Non-binary gender identities and expressions are not something we see protagonists getting to have, and too often we only see these identities being used for aliens or villains. How do we change this? Are these alien characters positive representations, or is the constant outsider status damaging to real people?""

I don't really agree with the idea that we don't see characters in science fiction having non binary gender identities. I myself was hugely inspired by the Hunger Games trilogy. Also japanese rpgs and cartoons like legend of korra are pretty inspiring to me. I think that it depends how loosely one defines science fiction or even genderqueerness. On a philosophical level I also wonder if one could have genderqueerness in a society that isn't based on a human male female binary. 

also I'll probably mention eths skin

I am a 19 year old natal male who has had gender issues since I was a small child. I have desired to be a girl as far back as my memory serves me, but I have never ""felt"" like I already was a girl. I feel comfortable as being considered a guy. I am OK with ""he"" and ""him"", and ""male"" being on all my IDs. Nonetheless, I still want to look like a girl.  

I am fine with my genitalia and lack of breasts, but any other masculine attributes give me dysphoria. I am fortunate in that I have a naturally feminine body and mannerisms, and I think with HRT passing would be very easy. It's just, where does it end?  

If I start HRT and work towards the body I want where does that leave me? Because at that point things would become way too complicated. Like, what bathrooms would I use if I identify as a male but look just like a girl? Would I not get sick and tired of explaining to everyone in public my situation every time I open my mouth, confusing people?

In March I had a pregnancy scare that ended in a miscarriage. The whole ordeal was stressful, but generally not too bad. I made the ""mistake"" of telling the person who got me accidentally pregnant about this (we had just began seeing each other and I DID NOT WANT TO GET PREGNANT), and well, it really put a damper on our fledgeling relationship. Over the summer, we were in different continents for work, and we were not in touch over social media but we did email each other a bit. I guess he didn't want to get trapped. Anyway, we are back in town, I tell him about how the trauma of the pregnancy really shook up my agender identity and stuff, and he is unsurprisingly not as affected (#BanMen). So I guess we are basically drifting apart now. While I'm in the process of coming to terms with it, I realize this isn't going to be like a normal breakup, because it feels that the pregnancy simply broke us up, and more than anything the trauma due to the loss of attachment (the possible future child, and the burgeoning relationship to its father) and I don't know how to deal. 

My therapist suggested I get busy and ""move on"" and I have taken that advice to a whole new level by becoming a manic workaholic. In the last three weeks, I have written the GRE, mastered German, written 3 PhD application (and many others are pending) and interviewed for the UN 3 times. You probably think this is awesome right? Nope. I can't relax if I tried. I can't have fun -- I can only work. I don't know what it would look like to be open and emotional with another human being, even romantically, at least around this time in my life. Usually, I'm alright. I'm buried in work from morning till midnight and then I'd get triggered by something random and start crying at 3 in the morning. Welp. 

Another thing complicating this entire business is that I was super in denial of the pregnancy, like lalalalalala, this isn't happening, this can't happen, i may be physically a woman but i only identify sociopolitically as such.

&gt;As some who know me may have noticed, my appearance and expression has changed a bit over the last year or so.  This being national  #comingoutday, I figured I may as well add a bit more visibility in coming out as transgender.  Now if I were to follow a traditional narrative of what people think of as a trans person, I would then go through a quick recap of all the ways I have always known that I was really a “woman trapped in a man’s body,” but this isn’t right.  Statements like these are massively reductive in that they generally ignore the large and varied breadth of experience that actually makes up the whole of reality that trans people live.  Transgender is somewhat of a catch all for those who find that they experience their body or their desired social expression in a way other than what is considered acceptable for someone of their assigned at birth gender.  If I were to to use generally accepted terms by the community to describe my experience of my own body and my own expression, “non-binary” would probably be most applicable.  In my case, this means to me that I have never really seen myself as a boy or a man other than all of the awkward expectations of masculinity placed on me by society where the choice becomes to conform or be ostracized.  On the other hand, I have also never seen myself as a girl or a woman.  This places me somewhere in between the false concept of a gender binary, or the idea that men and women are a set of two mutually exclusive groups with very little in common.

&gt;If anyone wants some light reading on the basics of trans stuff, I would suggest http://transwhat.org/ as a great basic source of information to people seeking understanding and guides towards how to be supportive of trans people.  It has a nice glossary of terminology and go over a bunch of myths that our media and culture tends to propagate.

&gt;So what does this all mean to those that know and interact with me?  Not really all that much.  My name is still Tony.  I still am a parent to 3 wonderful children and a spouse to my amazing wife.  I still have all the same interests and I would like to think generally the same personality aside from the personal growth that comes from opening oneself to a rather profound realization.  If you want to be nice, avoiding gendered pronouns would be cool as I would prefer to go by they/them/their as opposed to he/him/his.  That said, my desire to not have to teach human gender and sexuality 101 with every person I meet combined with my easy going nature and the fact that in many ways, how I’m perceived socially isn’t really the highest concern for me, all has the result that I won’t be all that concerned about policing the language of others.  Also, I would encourage anyone who has any respectful questions to feel free to ask me, as I will be happy to discuss further with more depth than the quick blurb here can do.  As far as how this goes at work, at this point I really don’t care all that much how this message percolates through the rumor mill, and I’ll just allow that to happen as I work on something a bit more formal for that environment.  Overall I believe the best expectation that I have for how everyone reacts to all this could be summed up as “polite indifference.”  If nothing at all changes about how i’m perceived and interacted with, great.  If this presents me with an opportunity to help break down the harmful social construct that is gendered expectations, even better.

&gt;Finally I do feel though I must put the postscript on some statements above to say that my lax nature when it comes to pronouns and my willingness to calmly discuss things with those that have questions does not make me one of the “easy” or “good” trans people, just one with a less drastic disconnect between my perception of myself and desire to be perceived that way by others.  Please don’t take my personal opinions of how I prefer to interact with others as a blanket statement for what is considered respect.  If a person tells you their name and pronouns they wish to be referred by, not doing so is considered very rude and hurtful.

2015-10-12 08:09:55,3offzc,10,5,"I'm writing this mainly as a way getting my current headspace in writing, but also getting the thoughts of others who may be in similar situations.

Okay, for a while I have identified as genderfluid. My lengthy definition for it is that I am a person born with a typically male body that, at some point, developed an interest in some activities and clothing seen as typically girly. I also developed a more feminine self identity and sexuality, while still being sexually attracted to girls, I want to be a more feminine sexual partner, maybe not even using my penis at times.

While I don't mind being seen as a guy at times, there are times I wish I could be seen as a girl. That brings me to my current social status. Right now, with how I look on any given day, if you were to see me at a Walmart or the mall, you'd see a typical guy. I have an awfully thin spot on the top of my head for one thing, I have kinda thick eyebrows, more often than not are sporting some shadow, and typically am wearing jeans (either girls slimmer fitting jeans or semi-relaxed type guy type jeans) and a semi loose-fitting t-shirt. I partly dress and present like this because it's low maintenance, but also helps me not stick out in a typically more conservative area.

Now, as for the shadow, I have darker hair and paler skin, so I'd have to put a lot of work into that. That's not to mention having no idea where to truly begin on my brows and having to resort to the idea of using a wig. That adds a bit of work that I don't see myself wanting to do every time I just want to go to the store.

Now onto other aspects of my social status. I'm a Christian and regularly attend and am involved with a local church. While they seemingly are somewhat liberal, I'm not at a position right now where I want to test how they are in LGBT acceptance. I also see myself having a potential to do a lot there, so I'm not sure I would want to mess that up.

Now about how I reconcile my faith and my gender identity? Well, I do know about Deuteronomy 22:5 as well as the verses about homosexuality. I view them as correct, for their time. I don't view me wearing girls clothes as wrong because I'm not using it to trick people. I'm not sexually active, so I'm obviously not seeking to trick some guy into having sex with me, nor am I using it to defraud or trap someone. I also don't want to use it as a ""voyeur"" type thing or something where I cross the line into typically female only environments to just spy on girls.

If you can make sense of all this, great. I hate if seems like a long rambly thing with no clear end, but sometimes ADHD will do that to your writing.

2015-10-15 21:43:57,3owtbt,15,10,"I'm a huge fan of herbal teas.  Since when I was pretty young, I drank a lot of certain herbal teas both hot and as iced tea in the summer.  As I got older, I started to pay attention to how I felt after drinking different herbal teas, and I noticed that I liked how I felt after drinking certain ones, disliked how I felt after drinking others, and felt neutral after others.

Mint teas were some of my favorite and my favorite two mints were spearmint (*Mentha spicata*) and the very similar apple mint / wooly mint (*M. suaveolens*). I loved how they smelled, and I'd drink both of them in quantity, especially during the summer, often making big batches of iced tea, blending them with other herbs like lemon balm.  I also use spearmint a lot in cooking, typically adding it fresh to salads and sometimes to soups or cooking it in dishes with meat, fish, or vegetables.

Later, I became fond of drinking true tea, i.e. black, green, or oolong tea from the *Camellia sinensis* plant.  I also especially love blending black tea with spearmint.  I have been drinking lots of tea and herbal teas for years now. I don't like how I feel as much after drinking coffee, so I don't drink it.

Recently I started researching the influence of various herbs and herbal teas on hormone levels and I was surprised to find that spearmint has anti-androgen effects, see [this source](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ptr.2900/abstract).  This study, which was actually studying the use of tea to treat hirsutism (unwanted / excessive body hair) in women, was interesting in that it observed fairly strong effects even with a modest (and completely safe) level of consumption of spearmint tea: about 2 cups a day.

[This NIH review](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3693613/) also cited green tea, spearmint, licorice, and many other herbs as having anti-androgen effects.  These different herbs seem to act differently too. For example, licorice seems to decrease total testosterone levels, whereas spearmint seems to decrease free testosterone levels, leaving total ones less affected.

I was thinking about how many trans people feel like various HRT regimes make them feel better or more like themselves, and how this is related to their gender identity.  I am AMAB and have always felt more on the feminine side for a biological male, and I've also felt a desire to be more feminine or embrace or express more feminine qualities than I do.  I wonder if my affinity for spearmint (and perhaps green tea and other true teas) is related to a combination of not feeling a fully male gender identity, and the anti-androgen effects of these plants.

Does this seem far-fetched, or plausible?

I'm curious to know if anyone else knows anything about this topic, or is at all interested in it.  I find it interesting because spearmint is a flavor that a lot of people enjoy, it's inexpensive, and widely available, and if it has the potential to have a directly observable effect like reducing body hair, that might be attractive to a lot of people.

2015-10-20 17:26:09,3pim1s,9,6,"Hello. I am an AMAB individual who is questioning their gender. At the moment I am using the term Genderqueer, but I really don't know what I am.

I have never felt entirely comfortable with male, but instead I've always just found my own way to do me, so I've never usually been at odds being in a male body. I think most my conflicted feelings come from how others perceive me, and the limits that sometimes places on me. If I'm around guys, I'm often treated as ""one of the guys"", with expectations that make me uncomfortable. If I'm around girls, I'm often treated as an outside, which makes me feel like I'm unable to share certain things with them. It also makes it difficult to ask to be involved in things like ""girls nights"" when I'd like to be. There are times when I'd like to explore my femininity, but I feel trapped and prevented from doing so.

I've always had an admiration and curiousity for trans people and their ability to cross the gender boundaries that we are forced to live in. Recently, I've started exploring my gender more fully. I don't feel like I really identify as any gender in particular. When I try to look inside myself and ask ""what gender do I feel like"" I get nothing back. I wonder if this means that I'm cis, or still questioning, or something else.

Ideally I see myself as a gender non-conforming female. A ""geekgirl"". I think this would portray how I see myself best to the rest of the world. I also sometimes feel like I can identify a lot with the ""lesbian"" identity, but then I get this awful feel like I'm trying to take that identity away from someone else. If I were to transition, I would want to transition to female, but present as androgynous from the female side of the spectrum. I'm not comfortable presenting androgynous from the male side of the spectrum. That presents something completely different to me.

2015-10-23 16:34:59,3pxahz,7,16,"I've been kicking around ideas about my gender identity for a long time, and just came out to my new therapist about it, and in talking to her I realized this has been a key question to me for at least 7 years.  That's a damn long time, and I kind of want to do something about it.

I've been thinking a lot about how I want to present myself, so that I can better reflect what my inner gender identity is, when it seems impossible to me to come off as anything but a cisgender woman, especially when I'm dressing in women's clothes.  I'm fine with that, to some degree – it's easier to live that way – but at the same time, I'm not.

When dressing up in hyper-feminine clothing, I somehow feel more like a boy, and when dressing masculinely, more obviously like a girl, or lately, more neutral- I know all of these things are something I put on, though, and not a part of me, and I think the gendered clothing just brings out the feeling that it's all a performance.  I LOVE getting to play around with it, but I want that to be just the window dressing on my body – not something that has to represent my identity to the world.  And while dressing masculinely automatically queers up my presentation, dressing femininely, which I like more, a lot of the time, doesn't – my hair (an undercut) is probably the only thing that could cause some confusion.

I've been thinking that maybe, instead of giving up some of the more feminine 'dressings' on my body, I could somehow make my body itself more masculine – basically making it harder to pass as female. But I'm small and short, and gaining weight. I'm kind of babyfaced and I want to keep my boobs.  I wish I could just kind of stretch myself out, get taller and leaner and more angular, but I know that's not really possible (and probably has something to do with standards of beauty as much as it does any perceived 'maleness.')  I'm afraid that if I were to do anything hormonal to my body, I would wind up with facial hair, acne, and skin changes that I don't want, and lose my hair early like my father did, and lose my breasts.  I'm basically at a loss, because I don't think a physical transition that I would WANT is truly possible, and I feel like I must be crazy to want to give up passing privilege, in a way. I don't know if my physical appearance is so important, in the end, and if changing it would make me any happier.  I do know that working out again to get stronger would make me happy in and of itself, gender issues aside, so I think I will try to start with that. 

But basically, tldr – AFAB genderqueer wondering if physical transition is something attainable or desirable so that I can be look like the inbetween person I feel like, on the inside, no matter what I'm wearing on the outside.

I am an openly trans pre-school teacher. I work at a wonderfully accepting school with co-workers and a boss that support me 100%.

*****

A young faun who is outwardly male, but Twin Spiritish.   Lithe body.  Stone hooves, sapling antlers, and feral paws for hands.  Attracts flying insects and moss.  Smells of loam and pollen.  He practices animism, and is something like a faery knight-squire errant, though often he's even more like a matchmaker, helping spirits and creatures.  The opposite of a darwinist, even in nature.

He himself has a tiny always-companion: Rosamatthias, a celestial fennec fox who calls himself a kitsune and functions as a bard-thief and the faun's guardian angel.

He makes faery darts from spirited thorns and mushrooms, never more harmful than charming someone into dreamful sleep.  He might turn into a bluebird, fawn, or hare to escape a hunter or romp through the forest.

The faun's name should ideally be original, soft and sonorant, lightly suggestive of his rustic origin as a wild fae, but even more in tune with his nurturing personality.

2015-10-26 07:41:03,3q95aw,3,3,"So! I think I'm going to start journalling about my ongoing process of transitioning as genderqueer and coming out. I realize this is something I should've started a while ago, but, eh.

I'm going to set up a private blog. (I realize everyone says paper journals are better for this stuff but I write better on a computer than by hand.) 

So here's the thing I'm hoping to get feedback and suggestions on.

I don't want it to just be a feelings dump.

Feelings dump journals are good and useful, but I already have stuff for that.

I want it to be more like a fitness journal or a therapy journal. I want it track progress, insomuch as that's possible given there are a lot of intangible goals associated with this sort of thing (and some things transcend ""goals""). I want my journalling to *do something*, if that makes sense.

Here's a couple things I'm thinking I could do with it:

- Feelings dump. I know I said I don't want to do that, but I mostly just don't want it to be the main point. Transitioning and coming out induces a lot of feels. And that's ok.

- Work through thoughts on how presentation, and maybe bookmarking some valuable resources (like where to buy femme clothes in my size).

- Consolidate some random documents I already have online related to this process, like the list of people I want to come out to in [Stage 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/3hx3a6/i_have_a_tentative_plan_for_coming_out_but_i/) and the rough draft of my coming out letter. (Right now they're documents sitting in my Google Drive.)

- Work through or rehearse difficult conversations. A lot of them will follow the same script, more or less, but some of them are going to be more fraught. As an example, I write for a national publication, and while I'm not famous by any stretch I do have a public identity and followers on Twitter who follow me just to keep up on my work. (Which is SO WEIRD.) So at some point before I go public I need to get in touch with my editor and ask to change my byline. He will undoubtedly ask why.

- I want to start going to GQ discussion group thing. They have weekly meetings at a big LGBT resource center near where I live. (Thank goodness for living in a big city in a blue state.) I know a lot of discussion groups send people home with homework, so if this group does that I'll have a space to do that. And if not, just write through some of the stuff we talk about and my reflections.

So these are things I *could* do, but I don't feel like there's a structure here. 

What do you think? Did you journal during your discovery/transition/coming out process? What sort of things (broadly speaking, you don't have to share specifics) did you talk about? Is there anything I missed that you think I could do well to document?

2015-10-30 04:09:45,3qsskq,8,31,"Putting this on a throwaway.  I'm kind of unsure about myself and just need to vent a little.

I'm a transman.  Been on testosterone for three years, no surgery yet but I want at least top surgery.  I never really wanted bottom surgery.  I enjoy the way I have sex, and feel like I might want children one day so it's not something I'm really into.  For the most part I'm happy with my body after the changes from HRT, except for my boobs.

The thing is, I feel like my decision to transition wasn't because I felt fully male, but I thought if I had to choose one gender over the other, I'd rather be a guy.  I felt like it would be much harder to be taken seriously and get HRT and surgery if I publicly identified as genderqueer/neutral/idk.  I probably convinced myself that I felt more 'male' than I actually did.  Lately I've found myself wishing I could be more feminine.

2015-10-30 04:39:22,3qsvmz,6,7,"This is my first post here so if anybody knows a more fitting subreddit for this, please let me know.

So basically, I have two best friends and we all hang out together a ton. One is a cis male and the other is a non binary FtM. (I'm a cis female, if it matters.) 

Anyways, my non binary friend has recently chosen a more gender neutral name for themselves and has expressed their desire for gender neutral pronouns as well as slowly coming out to a small circle of people.

The issue is, my cis male best friend claims he does not and will *never* accept my friend as they are. He will not address them by their desired name since it is not the name that is on their passport/drivers licence. He also thinks gender neutral pronouns are simply ridiculous. He believes my friend is doing this simply because it is ""trendy"" and is nothing but a ""phase."" All of which, I disagree with.

I don't know why this bothers me so much, maybe it's just because I'm really passionate about feminism and gender studies. 

This is kind of hard because while my guy friend sounds like a total asshole from what I've described, he's actually really awesome (excluding his transphobic persona.)

I often feel very torn and like I am in the middle of this situation and I really don't know what to do. I try to avoid the subject when we hang out together as much as possible but is there any other ways to calm the waters?

Any advice or similar experiences would be appreciated.",genderqueer,I'm not sure what to do,1446205162.0,"{'created_utc': 1446179962, 'id': '3qsvmz', 'num_comments': 6, 'score': 7, 'selftext': 'This is my first post here so if anybody knows a more fitting subreddit for this, please let me know.\n\nSo basically, I have two best friends and we all hang out together a ton.

I more or less just avoid sex altogether because of how awful it feels to try and sexualize any situation where I have to deal with my own body in that way.
