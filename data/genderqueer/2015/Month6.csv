**Background:** I've been questioning my gender and identity for a while now, the strongest was during senior year of high school. Over that summer, I read up on personal stories, news from the community, etc.. Then college starts, an I get my first girlfriend. She liked referring to me as her boyfriend, and I didn't have a problem with that, so I never brought it up. Then, near the end of the semester, I shaved my legs, something that I never did before, something that makes me feel really good, and more comfortable, and yes, feminine. And I talked with her about it before, and she kept saying things like, ""You don't have to,"" and ""it's not easy, y'know,"" to discourage me, but politely. But after I shaved, she liked it, and was really turned on. And she had the same reaction when I talked with her, very briefly, about questioning my gender. 

**Situation:** last night, I tried to articulate how I felt over text and I waited for her response in the morning. Come morning, she talks to me about it, and is very supportive, talking about letting me try on her clothes, and helping me do my makeup and nails when I'm female. And she was more than supportive, she was also really, really turned on. More turned on than by thinking of me as a guy, I think. And she just loves thinking about me in lace panties and lipstick, and I like thinking about all of this too. But after sexting for a while, she composes herself. And while composed she brings up how it makes her feel. She feels a little weird, but she does really like it. She likes that I can be her boyfriend, and her girlfriend, and whatever. She is also worried about what this means about her orientation, because she's always defined herself as straight, and was surprised by how attracted she was to the thought of me expressing myself as female. I don't really know how to describe what I'm feeling right now, or what I'm expecting to happen by posting this.

I can shave and do makeup, work out, wardrobe, etc., but there's not much I've found so far I can do about my head hair. I know there's a trend for more androgynous or gender neutral hair styles right, and I've seen a lot of ideas for people with straight or wavy hair. But for myself...

Well, this is what we're working with here: [Wonderful Jew-fro goodness](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B5nYW3gIgAAXjLg.jpg)

I've messed around with the thick stretchy hair bands before [(Proof)](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BecjARZIgAAiwg6.jpg) but that doesn't help me at work or if I'm just...in a mood at home. Wigs are ok but that means having them on any time I'm feeling on that side of the spectrum.

But recently I've experienced a rather disconcerting shift. For reference, for the past two to three years, I've been leaning very heavily towards the feminine side.

I've gone to all the lengths which I can possibly go to express it, without endangering myself excessively. 

This slipping away has been subtle, yet rapid; towards my masculine side. Something which I freely admit I don't feel discomfort in, but I don't necessarily feel ready for it's re-emergence.

Anyways, this has been something I've been struggling with my entire life but more so now that I'm growing into an adult and am finally starting to understand my personality (younger me would probably never expect me to be the person I am today, that's for sure) and one of the problems was my gender identity especially in the more recent years. Until recently I actually had no idea there was a difference between gender and sex, and I thought gender roles were just something women did and men did and that was it, no straying from that path.

So I did a little research recently and discovered a whole new world  of possibilities in my personality to more understand just where I fit in, stuff that was confusing now started to make sense with who I was and now I just would like some help from more experienced individuals. Basically I was born male, but I've always had a more feminine side to me that liked to come out.

2015-06-05 19:21:19,38piu6,0,1,"So my whole life, I've struggled with gender.  When I was too young to buy my own clothes, I fought my parents tooth and nail about whether I'd get clothes from the boys or girls section.  I hated that my brother got cool toys like Batman shaving cream and I got American Girl dolls.  As a child, you're pretty willfull and lacking a sense of self consciousness, and some of the first memories I have of becoming self conscious stem from being told I wasn't acting the way I was supposed to for my assigned sex* - don't play upstairs in that boy's bedroom alone with him, wear this type of underwear, go to a different bathroom than your friends (who were boys), wax/bleach my mustache and your underarms, your bra strap is showing, etc.

Now, I say sex, because of course as a kid, your parents and teachers and well-meaning adults describe this stuff to you in ""scientific"" terms, right? They say, this is a girl, this a boy, you have girl parts, this makes you a girl.  End of story.   So I grew up thinking being a girl was like having blue eyes or brown eyes.  And also like telling all the blue-eyed people that they had to use a  separate bathroom, or wear certain clothes, play with certain toys.  The gender binary was as evil to me as racism, a separate but equal system that must be abolished if I was ever going to live comfortably.  

Enter many years of dragging my mother into the boys' section and shamefully trying on pants that never fit right while she looked embarrassed for me.  Why couldn't girls have t-shirts that were looser and without stupid frills? What made cool Oxfords for ""guys"" and stupid heels for ""girls""?  I put my hair up into a greasy pony tail because I didn't like it long and hated the act of brushing through all the knots after a shower, and wore guys' shoes 2 sizes too big because they didn't sell small enough ones in the stores near my house and the idea of buying clothes on the internet wasn't something 12-year-old me knew how to do.  As my guy friends got older, I started getting shunned by them because I wasn't just ""not pretty"" or ""not stylish"" - I was a disaster.  Everyone was telling me how to be a ""pretty girl"" but it felt impossible to be that thing, not only because it didn't appeal to me, but because it was also just not compatible with many of my natural features.  And everywhere I turned a different sort of aesthetic seemed to evade me - it was ""ugly"" to be ""too butch"" and I was filled with shame for experimenting, and the stores never had clothes that fit me anyway.

Finally, I gave up.  I wanted to feel good about myself, for once, and feel attractive, and I had no idea how to do that while staying authentic to myself.  The clothes in the guys' section continued to not fit properly, I continued to receive messages from my parents/schoolmates/media/etc. that masculinity in AFAB people was gross and undesirable.  So I wore dresses and heels and looked at myself in the mirror and felt like I was in drag, but suddenly people were telling me I was beautiful for it.  I was intensely unhappy, but I was before, too. 

Enter...learning about trans people.  Learning that ""gender identity"" was something that you felt innately, from inside, not something that was assigned to you like a race because you had certain arbitrary features in common with other people of your sex/gender.  Suddenly, my world exploded a little, and not in a good way.  I was intensely intrigued, but also angry, at first.  Yes, I had wanted all my life to be seen as a ""boy"" - if that meant being able to be considered attractive even with short hair and facial hair, being able to shop in the sections of the stores I liked most, be friends with the people I wanted to be friends with and not feel like some invisible line in the sand divided us.  But it angered me that I had to say I WAS one, to get everything I wanted.  Like a black person having to insist they were white to use the same water fountain.  And by this point, I had grown to take a certain pride in being a girl, in weathering sexism and misogyny and the patriarchy, even if I didn't ""feel"" like a girl anymore than I felt ""white"". Also, people were taking T to grow the facial hair and leg hair and hard chin and facial features that I had spent years loathing because people hated me so much for being different for it? As long as these things were part of ""transitioning"" to being a ""male"" they were attractive and desirable, something to strive for and post timeline pictures about.  If they just ""were"".....well good luck. 

Yes, this is where the radfemmy in me came out.  I asked a thousand embarrassing and politically unpopular questions about being trans to my increasingly inpatient queer friends.  ""How do you feel your gender identity? How?"" I would demand.  They would say, ""I don't know. Cis people don't know.  You only know if your trans."" Great.  So I'm a ""girl"" internally, and it has nothing to do with all my vagina or my ovaries or chromosomes or the only thing had ever defined being a girl for me.

Eventually, the anger around trans issues faded.  I saw trans people everywhere breaking down barriers for me as a gender nonconforming person - a non binary person rocking femininity and a beard,  a trans man rocking a button down and jeans and jacked arms and being 5'1"", a beautiful trans woman with a hard/large chin.  I saw that as curious as I was, it wasn't helpful to anyone - not even me - to question trans identities.  Trans people were on my side.  We were having to fight a lot of the same battles, and break down a lot of the same walls.

But my own confusion over my gender remains.  It remains tied up in years of shame I'm sure I'll never shed about certain natural features that aren't seen as womanly or beautiful, years of constructing my identity as a ""woman"" around only experiences of marginalization and what's in my pants.  I've picked up tricks around where to buy ""masculine"" clothes that fit better, and have in the last year cut my hair for the first time ever, and shed some of the more feminine things that I had forced myself to ""like"" and ""feel beautiful"" in.  But I still look in the mirror and see someone unattractive. My girlfriend didn't assume my gender identity at first, and would call me ""wildly attractive"" instead of gendered terms like ""handsome"" and ""beautiful"" and I liked it for awhile...but one day she looked at old pictures of me on Facebook when I was playing up the femme thing, and said that I was ""very pretty""  back then.  It felt like a punch to the gut, and so I said, ""Am I not pretty now?"" She's started calling me beautiful but now I cringe every time.  I feel like I'll never be comfortable in this world as I am, but that there's nothing to ""transition"" to or ""become"".  I don't know if I'm happier now dressing more masculine, because I also feel less ""sexy"" and ""desirable"" again.  I'm afraid I'll always feel ugly and out of place in my own body.

2015-06-05 21:10:03,38pyi0,2,17,"My sibling (FAAB) came out as genderqueer very recently. I guess I'm wondering how I can be the best sibling to them and how to help both my sibling and the rest of my family adjust to this smoothly.

I came out to them via drunk text a few months ago (I am cisgender but queer) and in return they came out to me. I accepted that without a second thought and I am 100% supportive of who my sibling is. Recently they came out to our parents and on facebook.

I have not come out to my parents and have no plans to do so in the near future so I am immensely proud of my sibling for having that courage. I know that my mother loves ~~her~~ them so much and is supportive but she is struggling with it. On the phone today she mentioned something along the lines of ""I don't have two daughters anymore"" and it is obvious that this was a huge surprise to her. I want to help my mother understand better and help her adjust to it so that my sibling can feel completely accepted in their own home.

My sibling has been depressed for at least the last year and I'm sure that struggling with their gender played a part in that. On the bright side they are on antidepressants and in therapy and it seems to really be helping.

So I guess I'm not sure how else I can help my sibling other than being there for them and making sure they know that I love and support them no matter what. I am still slipping up with pronouns occasionally but I'm trying my best.

And I also want to know how I can help my parents. They are immigrants from a very conservative part of the world and although they are very accepting of queer people I don't think they know how to handle having a queer child.

If it matters at all my sibling is still in high school for at least another year and will probably be living at home for at least the next 3-4 years.

I'm AFAB and I've been genderqueer for nearly my entire life without ever acknowledging it. I learned fairly early what a transgender person is, as opposed to cisgender. I never felt fully male, so passed off my discomfort and dysphoria as normal.

Fast forward, and I'm 18 years old, on the cusp of a new beginning, one I'm hoping will be as the real me. I only came out to myself and my friends in March, but I feel ready to tell my parents.  I've acquired some make clothing, a binder is on the way... And I'm doing research into packers for male days. I've changed my pronouns and officially go as my nickname for my birth name (it works both ways) and all I have left to do in this huge transition is tell my parents, and I'm so scared.

They even had trouble accepting that I was bisexual. Now mind you they were supportive and great about it, they just had a hard time wrapping their heads around it. They also mentioned in their shock that I shouldn't wave it in people's faces or attend pride because it was unnecessary flamboyancy. *Queue human and gay rights rage* But seriously... They aren't intolerant... Just a bit uneducated and uncomfortable with half naked people parading around in the streets. (Lol). But to my main point:

How do I come out to them? Should I do it in a creative or funny way and then educate them on what it means to be genderfluid? How much do I tell them? How do I explain how important it is for them to call me they/them? I'm just very vulnerable right now and I want to seek my dads help in dressing myself.

So sorry if this post seems kinda out of place or something.

So basically this is what the experiment is: I went on Steam and changed my name to a somewhat female name ""A Random Vixen"" To see how my mind would react to people thinking of me as female. 

I guess you can kinda consider it exploring the more feminine (or as feminine as a tomboy can get heh) side of me where I've explored and discovered a lot of things I didn't know about myself: in video games. And honestly, it felt pretty awesome having people think of me as female. I even unleashed a side of me I haven't seen in a loooong time: the funny, joking crazy person that has seemed to have been locked away somewhere until I did this. 

I did the same thing in a couple other places that allowed username changes, and somehow I started to feel less stressed somehow. 

After all of that I decided to run a small experiment within the current one. That experiment was to go back to Steam and change my username back to my previous, masculine sounding name.

The results: Didn't like it. At all. That less serious side of me disappeared and was replaced with the same ole' dark side that's led me to some dark places in life. It just didn't feel... right I guess you could say. It didn't feel wrong, but it felt off...

I changed it back to A Random Vixen immediately, and all the stress I could feel building up in me just melted away.

I decided to keep my username on Steam as A Random Vixen and might work on re-making an account on another site to sorta fit my more feminine side, because I feel better with people seeing me as a female than a male.

Sorry if this was typed completely incoherently, it's almost 5 in the morning on my end (insomnia is fun hahah), and I hope the people of r/genderqueer don't mind me sharing my odd experiment.

2015-06-13 14:36:14,39pjyx,10,10,"So, as a disclaimer this is going to be rambly. I just feel like I've got to get this off my chest because right now it's just too much and I'm upset and I can't really talk to anyone I know irl.

I'm afab and genderfluid, and finally I worked up the courage to tell my therapist about it, and she was very understanding and great, and she said that she takes me seriously and that I didn't have to worry about her thinking that it's just a phase or anything like that. Anyway, I told her that I regularly experience doubt regarding this. I'm really good at getting in my own head and messing with myself and I think the doubt comes from two things. One being that I've found ways to avoid dysphoria. I've learnt to think that I've got a healthy body, and that's really all I could ask for. And then I distract myself from thinking about it any further. I also think it's because I really would like to be cis, so therefore I constantly challenge myself and push myself into thinking that in reality I am female. It's just body insecurities etc... I also think that my father's words got to me. I tried telling him about genderfluidity and he said ""Well, it doesn't really matter what you feel like, does it? I mean you'll always be 100% female. It's just biology!"". I know he didn't mean to be mean, he's just kind of set in his ways, but it still felt like what I'm feeling isn't valid because I've got female genitalia and breasts... And then it got me thinking ""but he is right! I do have a female body... what if this feeling is invalid? What if gender is in fact just biology and these feeling are just part of my personality and that I'm prone to anxiety??""

Anyway, my therapist said that it was probably because I've lived my whole life in a society that only sees everything as binary and therefore I'm used to subconsiously thinking that way too. And that means that I have to come out to myself too, and learn to accept myself and get to know the part of me that I've been neglecting, and that it's a process and it takes time. She said that whatever I'm feeling, I should not have to feel like I'm a fraud or that I'm making things up, or that I'm not queer enough etc. 

I know this should make me feel great, but it doesn't. I did at first, but then it shifted. I took her words to heart, and today I decided that I wouldn't let myself put myself down by thinking ""you are weird and it's not real""-thoughts. At first it felt great. I went for a walk in the city, and I felt proud of myself for finally letting me be me and I even stopped slouching! However, that feeling didn't last, because as the day went on I felt less female than I've ever done before. I think it's because I've constantly pushed myself into thinking that it's just a phase and that I'm really female. Anyway, this is the farthest from female I've been and I feel like shit. The last couple of weeks I've started to feel uneasy when being called a girl and such, but I thought I was just imagining it. Anyway, today the feelings that I've been trying to hold back kind of pushed through and hit me with full force. I've started feeling more physical dysphoria again. Not very much, but more than before. Definitely wanting a more andro/male body build. And I also experience more social dysphoria. It makes me feel sad and hopeless that I know that no one will ever look at me and see something other than a female. And that everyone will assume that I am female. Always. 
I've been toying with the idea of picking a new name and introducing a it as a nickname. I didn't do anything about it though, because I thought I was just being silly and bored with my birth name. But now I feel really sad. Like I really don't want my name anymore. I want a neutral one, and since I'm swedish there aren't many neutral ones to choose from. Not that I like anyway. (srsly, apart from the two I've been thinking about, there's only kim, robin and elliot. And I really don't feel like they would fit me, and the rest of the swedish GN names all sound kind of made up. At least I think so...) As I said, I only like two. The first one is charlie, but that isn't really an option, because my cousins name is charlie. If it wasn't already taken I'd choose that one straight away, since I've liked that name since I was a small child. But since it's a no go my other option is Eli, which feels like an okay name. But not, like charlie, which feels just right... And also I'm afraid that people will think my name is Elin (which is a girls' name here) because it's pronouced exactly the same, except for the N at the end. And that makes me feel hopeless too, because since I'm unable to choose a name that I like, I have to keep getting called by my birthname and it makes me so sad and upset. I'm on the verge of tears everytime I think about it. It feels like no one except my boyfriend will ever see the real me...

2015-06-14 00:18:17,39rc0g,9,3,"I need help. I have such terrible anxiety and depression, and on afraid a lot of it hinges on my sexuality and sexual identity. I'm so confused, and thanks to a very conservative and repressive ""traditional"" upbringing, I've always been confused and never known how to feel. I know now not to feel ashamed, I think.

Anyway, into the nitty gritty. I was assigned a male at birth, and I find the female form more sexually appealing than a man's. But, and of course there has to be a but otherwise why would I be here,  I can't say that I feel that in a man, not wholy, nor do I feel like I am straight. In highschool I explored being transgender. I had a lot if female fridge and would ""begrudgingly"" let them give me make overs. Very soon I became increasingly melencholic, it's part of my being, but when it gets bad and turns into depression that's a different story. I felt like it was easier to be Gothic because I could get away with more effeminate clothing and make up, and instead of my super conservative and religious mother and step father, or my super traditional father and critical step mother thinking there was something wrong with me mentally, they just thought it was emotional, which was easier to coup with.

But I still wasn't attracted to men. I was attracted at women, I was shy so if course I had plenty of friends but was never in a relationship because even then I didn't quite know what I wanted. I dated for the first time as a 17 year old senor because the girl was just very forward and dominant. These days I don't like dominant, but I do like forward. Needless to say it didn't last long, but I got more bold and more social. I finally had sex when I was almost 19, had to wait until I was at least over the are of 18 right? Both parents would be proud of that if they believed it. And honestly I loved it, the beauty of the act, the intimacy. I'm an artist and a romantic, what can I say. But I learned then that I truly love the freehand form. It inspires me as well, there were plenty of times I would paint while watching a naked lover sleep, but it is mostly sexual attraction I realized. Because soon I started to club, which is where I got away from standard make sterotypes and saw ask the other faces of humanity. Especially feminine men. To which I took an instant liking.

I've never been with a man, the closest I've ever gotten was making out with our shirts off, most of my friends thought it was a stunt, but I thought he was beautiful, not handsome, beautiful, that's when I found that it wasn't the female form I was attracted to, it was the softness, glowing, the more ""effeminate"" nature that I was so attracted to. I found that I could have crushes and love men that fit in that niche I had created, and there are plenty in it. But transsexual women and Cross dressers are very attractive to me, but do are women, but not all women. I feel almost petty, but it is all about how they present themselves, how they take care of themselves. Things like weight and make up didn't matter so much to me as simply taking care of their appearance, and being genuine in their actions. Something I can say I don't do. But maybe this is of topic, I'm here for me, which sounds selfish, but I need to say this and hopefully find some insite and solice.

Now I get very strong urges to be a woman, though other times I feel almost genderless, and yet other times I want to be a man, a manly man. The gender less feeling may come from a confused sexuality as well as identity, but I wouldn't know. Maybe if anyone comments they will. I'm married now, to a woman, she knows how I fell and is fine with it which is great to know, but being as confused as I am, she is equally so. I do love her, we even have a perfect daughter who is 1 year old today actually. And all of that makes me happy. But that is a single aspect of my life, my identity as a whole has always been cracked, muddled, confused. When I have sexual urges, sometimes I imagine men, well mostly transgender women, there have been maybe a handful of men that I've ever known or even seen that I was attracted to as just men, but I also fantasies about women more so. So I feel bisexual, but again I've never been sexual with a man. And when it comes to my gender, I just don't know, I love my penis, I mean I totally love it, it's perfect and great. But sometimes I imagine having breasts and identifying as a woman would feel so great. Which in itself sounds like im transsexual. But other times I think, I'm meant to be a man, maybe those other thoughts are a testosterone deficiency or something. But I'm 27, well past the time in my life that my hormones would cause that big of a deal, and I'm conscious of my sexuality daily which I know is not standard.

I just don't know what to do anymore, and I need help and insite from the lgbt community that hopefully can relate to what I'm going through or have been through.

2015-06-14 03:38:09,39rumz,11,16,"Context: 16 year old AFAB

I have a feeling this is going to be kind of long. So.

I honestly don't know whether I'm genderqueer anymore, or more, if I ever was.
I first started considering myself non-cis about this time last year, if not a few months more. I'd taken on the identity of demi-girl, which I later thought was acting as a stepping stone more or less as I was further exploring my identity.

And then… it seemed to get more progressive. At that time I was still basically a girl, expect kind of not. I still used she/her, still had long hair, didn't feel uncomfortable using the girls bathroom, etc. But then those kinds of things started to show up as I moved towards a more trans masculine identity. I broke down when my girlfriend called me a girl. I cut off my hair after being looked at as feminine. I started to experience dysphoria: anxiety about my chest, phantom limb feelings in my crotch area, and every period would make me suicidal.

Lately I've been entertaining the idea if going on low-dose testosterone. At first I was uncomfortable with some of the changes, but then they didn't seem as bad. But now…? I don't know. I have no idea if this is a phase or what. I mean, what if I was just doing this to fit in on tumblr or something like that? And the whole chest dysphoria thing is mostly just because of the way people see it as feminine. And there have been women who just don't like their periods, to the point where they feel disgust of the word 'woman'. And I've been known to have phases my whole life? Is this just another one?

I just feel so feminine lately and I have no idea if this is just my identity being fluid or if I'm really just cis.

At first I was uncomfortable with some of the changes, but then they didn't seem as bad. But now…? I don't know. I have no idea if this is a phase or what. I mean, what if I was just doing this to fit in on tumblr or something like that? And the whole chest dysphoria thing is mostly just because of the way people see it as feminine. And there have been women who just don't like their periods, to the point where they feel disgust of the word 'woman'. And I've been known to have phases my whole life? Is this just another one?\n\nI just feel so feminine lately and I have no idea if this is just my identity being fluid or if I'm really just cis.

Well, all started very recently, like 3 months ago. A oerson from my Facebook made a post saying that from that moment on, they wanted to people use neutral pronouns, shaved their head, etc. This got my attention, and since I got addicted to RuPaul's Drag Race, I started to see things differently.
I play online games since I was 10, and I used to use nicknames with my name (a obviously feminine name...) and didn't care, but about 2 years ago the harassment I was suffering for being a ""girl"" started to bother me, and more, I simply hated when my friends (whose were playing w/ me) yell at the chat that I'm a girl, so I changed my nickname to a neutral nickname and asked them to not call me by my name while playing, nor saying in the chat anything 'bout my gender.
But the inconfort only grow more and more, and I used to hate too when people refer to me as ""woman"" and stuff like this (out of the game, in real life too), and there is some time that I used to think ""wow, I want to be a boy so bad!"" like, if in the moment I was born I get the oportunity to being asked if I want to be a ""boy"" or a ""girl"" I surely would say ""boy"".

But then I realized that I can also be agender, because there are days who I doesn't want to be any gender in specific, but there are days that I want to be a boy, etc...
Oh my god, I am so confused! I swear I've read a lot already, but the more I read about, more questions pop in my head... And some of them are: gender fluid and genderqueer are different things?

So this is my face &amp; hair right now: http://imgur.com/a/u1aPf

I don't hate my hair, but I feel like it could look a LOT better. I quite like having the hair on top a bit longer (although I think it's getting too long) and the sides short, but I dislike the fact that one side is shorter. It's also shorter in such a way that makes my  head look really round, imho. Also, the longer hair on the back of my head just needs to go.

Does anyone have some suggestions? I'd prefer pictures that I can show to my hairdresser if you don't mind. I'm dutch and I don't know how certain terms translate to dutch hairdresser jargon. I'm kind of clueless.

Other tips &amp; tricks are also welcome and appreciated since, again, I'm absolutely clueless and kind of just figuring it all out.

However, how I would cope with the inevitable reactions, mostly from the friends I was with, terrified me.

So, I'm back from Download and I have a nice long post to make. It was fun (and a bit wet), and I was half-dead by the end of it.

But anyway, an opportunity arose on day one, when there was just me and one very close friend at camp - the blame for me being 'out' at all lies squarely at her feet, and she's been great. With everything, her viewpoint has been 'do what you want and don't care about what people think' - she's probably bored of telling me that now, and if only I could embrace that, life would be so much easier. Anyway, she repeated that mantra to me when I told her what I was thinking of doing, and so eventually with everyone else away, I went and put the dress on. This was mid-afternoon, and I'd been drinking since about 08:30, so Dutch courage definitely helped too.

So, I sat down again, immediately feeling very self-conscious. But I then very quickly settled down again and we carried on chatting and had a bit of a giggle. I was however, still very much aware of the fact that I was wearing a dress, but didn't care. But anyway, slowly the others returned to camp (and generally looked at me quizzically), and I still had enough of a tipsy wit about me to give a half decent response to each - a truth, but just a part concealing the real truth. Although I'm ready now to answer a direct question, if asked, I'm not openly volunteering it, yet. I'm sure, much like I was before, that those peeps may have guessed that there is something to it, but none have said anything; for what it's worth, acceptance is not what I'm worried about - I have great friends - it's more a case of the more I step out and the more people 'know' rather than suspect, the harder it may get for me to control it, and having controlled it resolutely for a long, long time, I think it is that thought that scares me the most.

However, of the group that I was with, there is one person that I have been waiting for the right opportunity to come out to, and finally the chance arose a couple of nights back. He himself is straight-leaning bi, and an all-round good egg to boot. So we had a bit of a chat and his reaction was about as expected - ""you're still you."" As a bonus, in amongst the fogginess of mind that you get by having conversation being conducted while absolutely munted at a festival at 02:00, there were a couple of salient points that have stuck with me.

So I've just had an awesome week. There was the festival itself, which is just so much fun, but I also had personal success too - at so many points I caught myself smiling about the fact that I was further outside of binary box I've lived my life in than ever before. Even when I was just dressed in more standardised clothing, I was still wearing eyeliner and my nails were painted, and this just wasn't even something I was conscious of to the point it almost felt normal. Now if only that part would carry on to the real world.

The bigger picture though, is will this change anything going forward? After the first time I confronted my gender it took me a few weeks to settle back down, into the place where I've been for the last year. I have been comfortable enough there, but I'm just hoping I don't get a longing for more, or at least not before I'm ready to address it. But that is a story for another time...I'm good for now. :)

I mean, I\'m 30 now.. as a kid I was never ""girlish"". But I didn\'t feel like a boy, either, you know - just not so much like a girl, either. And then my aunt entered the picture, saying such things as ""you\'ll never be a mother, you\'re just not the type"" because apparently tomboys can\'t want to have kids, and ""you should just get a sex change"" .. I don\'t know, I have a feeling that might have been a little damaging, or at the very least.. spooky to hear. I recall that around the time she said it, I had just come out as bisexual (now pan) to a friend, and it had got around school very fast, and I was getting a lot of shit for that.. both for not being straight, as well as getting shit in the form of ""you\'re only saying you\'re bi for the attention"".

I first developed a crush on a girl at age twelve. I had a relationship with a trans boy before he officially came out at fourteen. I've always felt for boys. Like many people, I thought bisexuality was some kind of lie, like people were either gay or straight. So I was rather confused for a long time. 

Now I'm in my early twenties. Within the past month I came out to my mother and stepfather. I told them what nonbinary means and how I felt it described me. They're very accepting. 

Yesterday I made a post on Facebook defining myself as nonbinary and pansexual. I got a lot of love and support and it feels so good!! 

I noted that, to me, sexuality and gender is a spectrum. Everything is a spectrum in my eyes, there is no B&amp;W. 

I've spoken to my mother about changing my middle name to the male equivalent of my first, but that will be a while down the road.

I'm worried she's offended because we share the same middle name... And I love her and I love sharing her middle name. So if possible, I may consider adding a second middle name. I don't know about the legality of that.

Im trying to come to terms with what it means for me to be non binary. Early on I had worried (and I still do) that I might not be a girl and that my trans identity is false. Well...

Im definitely trans. But I dont know what I am.

My gender identity is murky at best. I am AMAB and have lived most of my life believing that I was male because ignorance of trans identity coupled with a male body and societys expectations. I just thought I might be gay and had a weird kink for crossdressing and wanting to be a girl sexually.

Eventually I embraced the possibility that I was trans. And actually transition was the obvious choice.

But I struggled with feeling like one. Instead I spent a lot of time worrying that I was wrong, and that I was just a guy who wanted to be a girl.

Now I dont know what I feel.

My identity is hazy. I know Im not a guy. But I also know I may not be fully a girl either. I dont like masculinity. My expressiom leans all the way femme and sometimes dips back to slightly masculine.

Still sometimes I feel that if there were no other option I might be ok with being a feminine guy. But I know I would still wish I was a girl.

I feel like I am non binary. And I want to be ok with that. Im Aly, I go by she/her. But am I woman?

2015-06-21 02:07:12,3akgnu,3,3,"Long story short, I have a friend I'm very close to, and we both have a romantic and sexual interest in one another, though our current situation doesn't really allow for a relationship (we live too far away from one another and both agreed long-distance was a bad idea right now). If it helps to know, I'm an AFAB agender person and my friend is a cis man.


Right now he still sees me as ""a girl"" *[shudders]* because I have yet to explain my situation to him. I just... don't know the right way to bring it up. That, and I'm also afraid of how he would react to it all.


The main things I'm worried about are these:


- I don't even know what his opinion/position on transgender and non-binary people is, or if he even knows what non-binary means in this context. I don't know how open-minded he'd be, or if he'd truly accept me.

- I'm afraid to bring up the fact that I'm considering hormones, voice training, etc. to bring myself more on the masculine side, because I fear he won't be attracted to me anymore, or wouldn't want anything to do with me anymore because of it. (As you can probably tell, he's very, very straight, though I do look somewhat masculine/androgynous already and he seems to like that. Though I'm agender, the things/ways I'm most comfortable in are ones typically associated with males and masculinity.)

- In his native language, my chosen name is male-only. I'm well aware that he will *never* call me by my name unless I really forced him to, and I don't want it to feel forced.

- I'm afraid he'll feel like I was lying to him and get angry because of it. It's only in the past few months that I really figured out my gender and stopped feeling ashamed of how I felt about myself, when we met I hadn't even started questioning anything about my gender identity, though I started soon after.


The irony in all this is that he's one of the people I feel most comfortable around overall, but I'm still too scared to bring this up...


I was recently talking to another close friend about these worries, and we both agreed that I need to tell him everything sooner or later. It'd feel dishonest to hide everything from him, and he needs to be aware of it so he can decide if, well... if I'm still worth his time or not. I'm scared, I really am. If I lost him, it'd break my heart. There's a part of me that feels like it'd be easier to just stay ""a girl"" and spend the rest of my life pretending to be one for his sake, but I've already spent twenty years faking it and I don't feel like I can live another twenty years like that. I fear that I will have to choose between being loved and being myself...

2015-06-24 05:33:13,3ax610,5,5,"Sorry, I had to make a throwaway for this, because my main uses a username that I use on other sites, so I might get outed.

Anyway, I'm just so sick lately of being labelled according to my so called gender by society. I was assigned male at birth, but since I was born I felt like I had to meld to these ideal male standards, both in terms of physical appearance and expected behavior. It feels incredibly obvious that people treat me as a ""guy"" - not even limited to things like calling me ""sir"" or ""gentleman"", but also how people just treat me in general, like having a man perform a body search on me when I'm at the airport, female friends not making as much intimate physical contact with me (like holding hands) as they do towards other girls, and getting creeped out if I make physical contact with them, etc. I'm sure to people who don't really understand the complexities of gender, like /r/genderqueer does, people would think that I was a creep and making unwarranted sexual advances, but in these situations I honestly just want closeness in my friendships. Having to keep my distance from certain people physically also makes me feel like I have to keep my distance from them emotionally. And I think it's because people misinterpret and overgeneralize.

That all aside, it constantly feels like people are imposing a gender identity on me. I understand that this is the *norm*; people simply treat others based on their physical appearance with innocuous intentions. Most of the time, they'd be right, because most people identify with the sex they are born - so probably at least 9 times out of 10, if you went to a grown man and called him 'sir', he wouldn't mind. But I think I'm different. I have no idea on where my gender identity actually lies, but I can tell you without uncertainty that being constantly treated 'male' rubs me the wrong way more than a little mildly. It's not that I necessarily identify as female either right now, but maybe what I really want is for people to stop labelling me by gender so damn freaking often. I have certain ways to get myself out of situations where I'm labelled 'male'. For example, if I go to a department store, and a clerk calls me sir, I'll reply, ""You don't have to call me sir"". And then they'll just look at me a little weirdly, but generally oblige. But there seems to be absolutely nothing I can do *preemptively* to ensure that others don't label me by gender. Like, unless I pass as female or andro in terms of physical appearance (I don't because of things like facial hair), people will just call me 'sir' if they run into me. It's an automatic, almost Pavlovian conditioned response I get from people, although I have no idea what sort of reward they even get out of labelling others. Maybe it sounds more polite to say ""Excuse me sir"" than ""Excuse me""? No freaking idea.

Even if I do decide to accept maleness as part of my identity eventually, why make such a big deal about it to begin with? I'm East Asian, and people hardly bring that up when they talk to me. Like, the way someone would greet me formally is ""Hello, sir"", not ""Hello, Asian"" or even, ""Hello, person with dark brown eyes"". It almost seems arbitrary that we label others **primarily** by gender - pronouns, job professions, familial titles (aunt, uncle, etc). Maybe it's because humans are a sexual species, and without differentiating by gender, things like sexual orientation would be difficult to navigate. But why does it have to pervade so many aspects of human life? There's a thread called ""Why's everything so gendered?!"" which addresses a similar topic as I do here, but I wanted to tackle the entire, cumbersome concept of gender distinction. I want to challenge the dichotomy, just like many of you do in your daily lives. 

Going back to the body search example, I suppose it makes sense that having someone who presents as the same gender as you do search you is almost infinitely better than having someone who presents as the opposite gender - because in the vast majority of cases, people's presentations are consistent with their gender identity. You might have the occasional closeted trans man who feels uncomfortable when searched by a cis woman, but these are so few and far between that it's simply easier for everyone to assume that everyone who walks through those metal gates is cis. Of course there are a lot of institutional barriers when it comes to gender neutrality, some of which is based probably on misinterpretation of others' intentions, but a lot of it which is definitely based on real, societal issues - like men groping women on the subway. To be honest, I don't even fully understand what I want out of life. To ask for true gender blindness sounds a bit impractical and even unsafe, but when I get my credit card statement, do you REALLY have to affix a ""MR"" in the front of my name? Is it that important that I integrate gender as a core component of my identity?",genderqueer,The seeming impossibility of being treated gender-neutrally,1435149193.0,"{'created_utc': 1435123993, 'id': '3ax610', 'num_comments': 5, 'score': 5, 'selftext': 'Sorry, I had to make a throwaway for this, because my main uses a username that I use on other sites, so I might get outed.\n\nAnyway, I\'m just so sick lately of being labelled according to my so called gender by society.

For example, if I go to a department store, and a clerk calls me sir, I\'ll reply, ""You don\'t have to call me sir"". And then they\'ll just look at me a little weirdly, but generally oblige. But there seems to be absolutely nothing I can do *preemptively* to ensure that others don\'t label me by gender. Like, unless I pass as female or andro in terms of physical appearance (I don\'t because of things like facial hair), people will just call me \'sir\' if they run into me. It\'s an automatic, almost Pavlovian conditioned response I get from people, although I have no idea what sort of reward they even get out of labelling others. Maybe it sounds more polite to say ""Excuse me sir"" than ""Excuse me""? No freaking idea.\n\nEven if I do decide to accept maleness as part of my identity eventually, why make such a big deal about it to begin with? I\'m East Asian, and people hardly bring that up when they talk to me. Like, the way someone would greet me formally is ""Hello, sir"", not ""Hello, Asian"" or even, ""Hello, person with dark brown eyes"". It almost seems arbitrary that we label others **primarily** by gender - pronouns, job professions, familial titles (aunt, uncle, etc). Maybe it\'s because humans are a sexual species, and without differentiating by gender, things like sexual orientation would be difficult to navigate. But why does it have to pervade so many aspects of human life? There\'s a thread called ""Why\'s everything so gendered?!"" which addresses a similar topic as I do here, but I wanted to tackle the entire, cumbersome concept of gender distinction. I want to challenge the dichotomy, just like many of you do in your daily lives. \n\nGoing back to the body search example, I suppose it makes sense that having someone who presents as the same gender as you do search you is almost infinitely better than having someone who presents as the opposite gender - because in the vast majority of cases, people\'s presentations are consistent with their gender identity. You might have the occasional closeted trans man who feels uncomfortable when searched by a cis woman, but these are so few and far between that it\'s simply easier for everyone to assume that everyone who walks through those metal gates is cis. Of course there are a lot of institutional barriers when it comes to gender neutrality, some of which is based probably on misinterpretation of others\' intentions, but a lot of it which is definitely based on real, societal issues - like men groping women on the subway. To be honest, I don\'t even fully understand what I want out of life. To ask for true gender blindness sounds a bit impractical and even unsafe, but when I get my credit card statement, do you REALLY have to affix a ""MR"" in the front of my name? Is it that important that I integrate gender as a core component of my identity?', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'The seeming impossibility of being treated gender-neutrally', 'created': 1435149193.0}"

Plus I have a decent life as a female, with a boyfriend who accept me as I am, so it's overall not too bad. 

But what I dislike FAR more than the gender of my body, is the  social construct and hypocrisy around ""femaleness"". And today I got a full blast of it in the face. I work in a field where being prudish and squeamish gets you nowhere: Agriculture. You work in dirt and/or shit all day long, it's freaking hot and hard work so you get smelly and sweaty. Having a wet bra (and it gets wets FAST because having anything on top of it prevents it from drying out) means you're likely to get fungal infection under your breast or on your back, which is NOT fun.

Couple all of this with the fact that I am VERY sensitive to heat stroke for some reason, when it gets too hot I have NO problem ditching the shirt. I wear thick sports bra that squeeze the boobs down and shows absolutely NOTHING(because I hate to feel them move when I work), and if women can get practically naked and wear see-through clothings all the time without problem, I don't see why it would matter for me to work in a bra that hides absolutely everything but leaves my flabby hairy belly out.

In exchange, I help by tending to the cow in one of his stable for a few hours everyday. One especially hot day, I was tending to my field when I noticed he was nearby. I waved him hi, to be polite, before returning to my work. I'd had a heatstroke a mere few days before, so of course, belly was out.

2015-06-27 13:18:05,3bauxb,8,18,"Okay, so, to set the scene: I live in a house with 4 other people, two of which are a gay couple and they of course have a butt-ton of LGBTQ friends. When the SCOTUS decision in favor of same-sex marriage came down, of course we had to party. A bunch of people were invited, many of whom were strangers to me but some of whom are mutual friends (but I still wasn't out to them, at least not blatantly).

Because of reasons that aren't really relevant, I wasn't around for the first half hour or so of festivities. So I don't know how this happened or what exactly was said. But apparently I got outed as ""gender neutral,"" which isn't quite right but, y'know, whatever, close enough. The night went no differently from the way I'd been expecting it to, for the most part. But I didn't even know I'd been outed until the conversation led in a direction where I played dumb about a comment someone made and, one roommate, realizing I was playing dumb, said, ""oh, yeah, we told them about the gender thing,"" and then something I forget along the lines of ""we thought it might make you more comfortable."" I haven't yet insisted on they/them pronouns but I've asked for no blatantly gendered terms like girl/lady/ma'am/etc. so I think what my roommate meant by this was that they told them with the intention of helping me avoid those things.

It's clear it wasn't a big deal to any of the people present, because, again, I might not have even known had it not been for that (and another incident where someone asked of my partner and I, ""oh, so you're boyfriend/girlfriend? oh wait, shit"" and was apologetic, haha.)

On the one hand, I feel like my roommates genuinely meant well and I don't think any harm came from outing me to this particular group of people. On the other hand, I don't know that I'm comfortable about being outed to people I barely know, especially because I *just* finally accepted I was non-binary about a month ago and am really, really early in the transitioning process (i.e. I got a short haircut and some sports bras and am getting a binder soon but I haven't even bought any more gender-neutral clothing yet and I'm not even quite sure if I'm doing HRT or any of that other stuff). And I don't even know for sure who knows and if that includes our mutual friends or not, because I wasn't exactly given a list.

Part of me feels like I would like full control over the coming out process, even if that means I have to deal with misgendering from people I'm not out to. That part of me is slightly peeved that this happened, because that control was taken away from me. But part of me feels like they did me a favor, because I'm still shy and skittish about this stuff and speaking up and the thought of coming out to people still makes the negativity committee in the back of my head go into overdrive. So I think it was useful to see that, hey, a bunch of people knew and it wasn't a big deal to anyone and no hateful bigotry happened and the world didn't end.

I'm just not sure how to process it, I guess. I don't know if I tell them not to do it again, because I don't know if the little bit that it bothered me is worth getting misgendered by friends of roommates (and they have people over *a lot* so it would be pretty frequent). I think I trust them to use good judgment in who they tell or not, since they're also LGBT and so have navigated the whole closet mess/""let's find out who's secretly a bigot!"" game. But I guess my main concern is that eventually they might tell someone who's not so okay with it, and then I have to deal with it, whereas if I'm the only one outing myself to people then I know exactly when and where I'm taking on that risk and the only thing I don't control in the coming out situation is the other person's reaction.

Sigh, IDK. My head's a bit of a mess right now. Thoughts?

EDIT: Thanks, all. I've given it some thought, and while I don't think I have a problem with them telling friends who come over, I'm going to ask that I'm notified who gets told and we're going to have to have a talk about what to do if anyone ever has a bigoted reaction (and if they're not willing to boot persistently bigoted people out of the house, they don't get to tell people anymore). I'm also going to ask that they limit it to friends who are coming over *only*, and not anyone else.

I had to really debate how I wanted to deal with it because I'm also bi, but I've known that for much longer and am much more ""settled"" in that identity so to speak so for that I seriously don't care who knows as long as they don't out me to my own family.

2015-06-28 09:12:28,3bdzjs,9,15,"I was born female and mostly identify as such. However, for a good while I've been questioning a few things.

Growing up I was a tomboy who disliked girly things, nothing seemed unusual or dysphoric there. However I started growing breasts around age 9 and I remember figuring that out and crying all night and praying to anything that would listen to not let this happen to me. 

As I grew older and went further in sports I really started noticing how the girls and the boys were separated more and more as we got older. This separation was not just in the obvious ""separating girls and boys teams at age 13"", but in social stuff too. Suddenly I realised I could not interact with men the same way they interacted with each other, there was always a separation. And I found myself wanting to be male so I could have that friendship. And I wanted to be seen as a boy and related to as such by others. 

I started dressing in masculine/androgynous ways. I cut my hair short and messy. I was proud whenever I was mistaken for a boy. I was upset when people called attention to my ""real"" gender. 

I grew up and figured I put that behind me. I went forward with the notion of ""all being female means to me is that I have a vagina, other than that I am free to do what I please."" And it's been freeing. I now enjoy expressing femininity as well as masculinity, as our society defines these things anyway.

However, it never really went away. I'd still get so angry if someone drew attention to the fact I was a girl or woman, though I tried to brush it off as me being sensitive to feminist issues. But no, the dysphoria(?) would come in waves. 

Just tonight I was looking at a man wearing a button up shirt, and I felt such an overwhelming longing to look that natural in a shirt like that, to be accepted and viewed as he was, as a pretty average and sociable man. 

However, I still enjoy being a woman as well, and expressing myself as such.

My SO is incredibly straight. He's wonderful, but bringing up this subject has always been real sensitive to him. I think he doesn't understand that I still want to be a woman, and I don't want hormones or surgery.

However, for a good while I\'ve been questioning a few things.\n\nGrowing up I was a tomboy who disliked girly things, nothing seemed unusual or dysphoric there. However I started growing breasts around age 9 and I remember figuring that out and crying all night and praying to anything that would listen to not let this happen to me. \n\nAs I grew older and went further in sports I really started noticing how the girls and the boys were separated more and more as we got older. This separation was not just in the obvious ""separating girls and boys teams at age 13"", but in social stuff too. Suddenly I realised I could not interact with men the same way they interacted with each other, there was always a separation. And I found myself wanting to be male so I could have that friendship. And I wanted to be seen as a boy and related to as such by others. \n\nI started dressing in masculine/androgynous ways. I cut my hair short and messy. I was proud whenever I was mistaken for a boy. I was upset when people called attention to my ""real"" gender. \n\nI grew up and figured I put that behind me. I went forward with the notion of ""all being female means to me is that I have a vagina, other than that I am free to do what I please."" And it\'s been freeing. I now enjoy expressing femininity as well as masculinity, as our society defines these things anyway.\n\nHowever, it never really went away. I\'d still get so angry if someone drew attention to the fact I was a girl or woman, though I tried to brush it off as me being sensitive to feminist issues. But no, the dysphoria(?) would come in waves. \n\nJust tonight I was looking at a man wearing a button up shirt, and I felt such an overwhelming longing to look that natural in a shirt like that, to be accepted and viewed as he was, as a pretty average and sociable man. \n\nHowever, I still enjoy being a woman as well, and expressing myself as such.\n\nMy SO is incredibly straight. He\'s wonderful, but bringing up this subject has always been real sensitive to him. I think he doesn\'t understand that I still want to be a woman, and I don\'t want hormones or surgery.\n\nBut I also wonder if this really is that much of a big deal.

So I wrote a post a few hours asking if there is anyone that also identify themselves as pangender. (I will delete it after posting this, because this post feels more relevant.) But now I kind of realize why there might not be any, because I was told that it is problematic, and cultural appropriation, which I hadn't thought of before, but now I can see why people would say that it is. 

I *really* don't want to offend anyone or be politically incorrect, and seeing as pangender is apparently problematic, I was wondering what my gender identity would be called instead?

(I just want to say beforehand, that I am sorry if I got it wrong when I tried to describe my view of any of the gender identities below. I've tried learning what everything is, since I've struggled with my identity for a while now. But I might have misunderstood some things, because no matter how many youtube videos I watch and blogs I read, people always describe the same things a bit differently.)

I thought for a while that I was genderfluid, but then I got the impression that it's mainly used by people who are fluid between male and female. And then I thought Genderflux, but that also seemed to be largely connected to the binary genders, mostly drifting between neutral and a binary gender. And then I thought of bigender, but I just don't feel like two genders. And I don't just feel like three either, so trigender isn't really who I am either. And then I thought of multigender, but the thing is I'm not *always* several genders at a time either. It shifts a lot. Sometimes I'm just one gender, but other times I'm five at the same time. And sometimes I feel like gender identities don't axist and then I thought, mayb I'm agender. But the next day I'd feel something else entirely...

I'm kind of upset, because I feel like I find security in having a label for myself. I know that others may not care, but I do. I want to know what I am, for my own sake. And trying to fit in to one of the identities I described above, made me feel like there was something off, and I constantly doubted myself, because one day I'd think ""I'm agender, I'm sure of it!"" And the next day I'd think ""Wait, that was wrong, I'm bigender!"" and so on and so forth. And the constant self doubt made me feel really bad about my self, because it made me think ""Am I just a fake?"" Because not even non binary people seem to believe that this is a thing, at least not from what I heard. One of my favourite youtubers have a video about gender identities, and in that video they say that you don't really have to bother to remember trigender, because they's never heard of someone being trigender, and it's just one of those ""be sure to include everyone""-identities, that no one has.. And that made me feel like shit, because I really look up to that person, and if they say that no one sees trigender as a real thing, then what would people think of the way I feel about my gender? And I'm also kind of afraid to post this, because I'm scared that people will react the same way and say things like ""that's not a thing"" or tell i'm trying to be a special snowflake or something.

But the next day I\'d feel something else entirely...\n\nI\'m kind of upset, because I feel like I find security in having a label for myself. I know that others may not care, but I do. I want to know what I am, for my own sake. And trying to fit in to one of the identities I described above, made me feel like there was something off, and I constantly doubted myself, because one day I\'d think ""I\'m agender, I\'m sure of it!"" And the next day I\'d think ""Wait, that was wrong, I\'m bigender!"" and so on and so forth. And the constant self doubt made me feel really bad about my self, because it made me think ""Am I just a fake?"" Because not even non binary people seem to believe that this is a thing, at least not from what I heard. One of my favourite youtubers have a video about gender identities, and in that video they say that you don\'t really have to bother to remember trigender, because they\'s never heard of someone being trigender, and it\'s just one of those ""be sure to include everyone""-identities, that no one has.. And that made me feel like shit, because I really look up to that person, and if they say that no one sees trigender as a real thing, then what would people think of the way I feel about my gender? And I\'m also kind of afraid to post this, because I\'m scared that people will react the same way and say things like ""that\'s not a thing"" or tell i\'m trying to be a special snowflake or something.\n\nIf you read through it all, thank you for taking your time to do that. I really appreciate it &lt;3\n\n(Edit: corrected some spelling errors and grammatical mistakes)', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Is pangender problematic??
