2015-08-01 00:57:39,3fcxsd,3,6,"I'm not really sure why I'm posting this - I already sent the letter yesterday, and my therapist doesn't even come back from vacation until Monday. I haven't been able to function at work this week at all. Yesterday I was very frustrated and impatient - I have the medical go-ahead to start T, why do I have to wait?!? But today I guess I'm back feeling blah, wondering if this is the right decision.

Anyway, I guess I'm posting this in case it helps any other guys/genderfolk who need to write something similar. I'll update next week with my therapist's response.

&gt; Dr. [therapist] -

&gt; July has been a very rough month. It has been very difficult to function at work/school. The next available appointment I could get with you was [8 days from now], but if you have any thoughts on what I'm about to say, please let me know before that? Even if it's only what I should expect when we next meet.

&gt; Around the time of our last meeting I made an appointment with an endocrinoloigist for continued sleuthing on my abnormal PCOS. This endo, Dr. [endo] at the [hour drive away from me] office, also works with transgender patients, so I asked my PCP to add gender identity disorder to the referral. I explained to her that although I am nonbinary, I feel very strongly about starting a low dose of testosterone. My motivations may be different than most: I believe my brain is wired to run off of a certain mix of hormones, and my current T levels are too low, which I believe is at least partially causing the persistent depressive disorder I have suffered from most of my life. (I have not been diagnosed specifically with this or its pre-DSM-5 counterpart dysthymia, but I read up on it and it seems spot on to my experience.) I think this is also the cause of me feeling really ""off-balance"" recently that I had mentioned (and has continued throughout July). I'm not a doctor, but my bioavailable testosterone last week seemed to be in the low end of even the ""female"" range, [number] compared to [range] for adult females. In March it was [slightly higher number], and Jan 2013 it was [double that but still in middle of female range], so this is the lowest I've ever seen it.

&gt; I have researched the potential physical changes that may come with even a low dose of testosterone. There is practically nothing in the scientific literature so I have to rely on what other nonbinary people have posted online about their experiences with low-dose T. Some of the changes I would like, and the rest I can accept. Of the permanent effects, I DO want a lower voice and larger genitals, more body and facial hair wouldn't bother me (I already have to shave my face), and male pattern baldness isn't great but I'm starting to get that anyway. With a low dose, I can go slowly and stop if things begin to develop in a way I don't like.

&gt; Dr. [endo] said she has not treated a nonbinary person before, but seemed open. The biggest relief was when she agreed immediately about the mental benefits of HRT being more than just happiness at starting a transition, since ""hormonal dysphoria"" is the part I feel the most strongly about and has NO research on it yet. I gave her a printout of this link http://neutrois.me/2012/08/27/low-dose-testosterone/ and she took it and said she wanted to do some of her own research. When I told her I could probably get a letter from a gender therapist she said that would be very helpful, asked if you have worked with other nonbinary people (I wasn't sure), and said if you consented she might want to speak with you on the phone. My impression is that this is new to her, but she's open to it and wants to make sure she does it right, and follow any established guidelines that she may not know about.

&gt; I forgot to tell her how in 2011, version 7 of the WPATH Standards of Care had significant changes made to it such that it accomodates nonbinary people seeking medical transition. Gender therapist Dana Hoffman-Fox talks more about that and specifically what it means for HRT letters here: http://darahoffmanfox.com/ask-gender-therapist-can-transition-im-non-binary-genderfluid/

&gt; To sum up: I have thought about starting a low dose of T for almost a year now, and very seriously for the past month or two, for the purposes of mental balance and some physical androgynization. I have done my research and understand the side effects, both beneficial and not. I can accept the not-so-wanted permanent effects happening to my body, not as a distant risk factor but as a real probability. I believe using a low dose of T would give me time to asses its effects before many physical changes take place. Dr. [endo] has looked over my bloodwork and said I am physically okay to start testosterone, and we know which medical complications I should keep an eye on. I have discussed this with my partner, my mother, my live-in brother, and my closest friends, and they all agree with my assesment and decision. I feel very strongly that this is the right course of action to treat my dysphoria and dysthymia, and want to pursue it without further delay. If your professional opinion agrees, will you write me an HRT letter?

Hi all, I'm what I thought was a straight female until about a year or so ago. I don't know exactly when it started, but I was always attracted to only straight guys until I realised that I wasn't.

It's not that I don't like them anymore -however, since about a year ago, all the feelings have started to get a bit messed up. For starters, I really like gay guys, and not just in the friendly sense of way. Seeing two guys together in more than just friendship way just makes my heart beat fast. Seeing pictures of guys kissing makes me excited. But I read lots of slash fanfiction, so at first I thought maybe I was just fetishising. But then I realised that I didn't just want to watch two guys together, I wanted to be them.

I grew up in a developing country where gay people aren't as common, or at least not out of the closet. I'd never even seen a live gay person until I moved to another country a year ago. I stood in line behind a gay couple at a supermarket, and just seeing them made me happy. I happily told them they make a cute couple, paid for my things and went home. And broke down in tears. It was then that I realised something might not be right about me. I wanted to be like them; I wanted to have what they have. I had a bit of a panic attack. Now, looking at gay guys makes me both elated and sad, with a feeling of longing and confusion.

The thing is, I don't mind being a girl. I like having my female assets, yet at the same time, I also want to be a gay guy. I just don't understand?

Also, I think I might like girls too, but mostly if they look somewhat androgynous. I mean, there have been girly girls that I think I could've developed a crush on, given some time, but I quite like if their appearance is androgynous or ambiguous. So there's that too.

I don't understand what's going on. I'm only 18, so is it some kind of phase or whatever? Am I making too big of a deal out of it? Am I supposed to just ignore and see how it plays out?

2015-08-03 08:24:31,3flk3h,6,7,"Hey all. You may have guessed from the title that a) I'm considering top surgery and b) I am kinda lost. I'll try to put all my relevant information here so those who may reply have more to work off of.

I currently live and am employed in Oregon, but I am still under my parents' insurance (Blue Shield of California) and am going to be legally independent next calendar year, as my parents did not claim me on their latest tax documents. However, I am only out to my parents in terms of sexuality and not gender identity, which is one of my largest obstacles other than the 20% of the surgery I'd have to pay even if insurance covered it (I heard someone with the same insurance had to pay $3K copay which I can't do right now (and doesn't mathematically make sense considering the average total costs I've heard but whatever)). I don't know if insurance things would be sticky due to ""medical non-necessity"" because I'm non-binary or because my dysphoria isn't life-threatening at this point, but the wording on the documents is inconsistent at best. At this point though, even with insurance it's not pocket money for me.

What I do know right now is that I really don't like having bewbs and this heat wave makes my dysphoria worse on top of making binding more uncomfortable even with just a sports bra. I can't stop thinking about top surgery and how beautiful and awesome a flat chest would be. I just don't know how to navigate the parents/insurance thing. It's highly recommended I go to therapy anyway so I can just play that as personal need, so is this what I should do first and foremost? Perhaps they'd have more information but I'm unsure. 

Would I be better off trying to change insurance? This may be difficult as I'll have to carefully navigate the issue with my parents, who in the past have told me that I need them to make my decisions for me, that I'm ill, that I'm punishing them, etc, but when it's all said and done they pretend they never said such things. The problem is getting to the ""all said and done"" part, here. (My stepdad flipped out like that when I texted my sister something shitty my mom said about her, so, imagine their reaction to surgery.)

Then, there's timing and location considerations. This summer I am just teaching math and doing physics research (theoretical, so computer work thus sitting) which would give me flexibility for recovery. My school year will be very busy, so that time frame's out. During this year or so I'll be in northern Oregon, for which I've found two surgeons, but after this year everything's up in the air as I don't know when or where I'll be attending grad school. Thus I'm feeling a sense of urgency to take advantage of Oregon's relatively less-transphobic laws. 

So I don't really know where to start with all these seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Coming out to parents? Telling parents I want to transition? Keeping insurance, saving up, and waiting? Or changing insurance if something cheaper is possible so I can start sooner? Even if I can fund the surgery no problem the parents part is an issue -- they are the loose cannon type. I realize you can offer advice on how to navigate coming out, but it is ultimately up to me. The insurance thing I could use some advice and guidance on, because I keep seeing these copays for top surgery under $100 and I can't figure it out.

Apologies for all this brainspew. It's a result of my tiredness and frustration. 

Bonus: I found one of my post-op burning questions asked on a forum but unanswered: In places where it's illegal for females to be topless, would it be legal for someone not FTM but with a masculine chest to be topless?

But yeah, title is basically it. As someone who has been applying for jobs in IT, it was sorta difficult to deal with being the only ciswoman (who happens to be also the only person of color) in my IT group, but since I recently came out as genderqueer, I'm really having an extra hard time trying to figure out how to deal with ""professionalism"" and well...bathrooms while I'm applying for other IT jobs.

By professionalism, I mean the whole thing. From clothes, to mannerism, to social media (linkedin), etc. For clothes, I'm fortunate that IT is pretty casual (I mean as casual as polos get) but I'm honestly thinking of going into law and the only trans* lawyer I know are Dean Spade who is pretty binary (as in, does not really push against the expectations of gender attire as far as I am aware of). What kind of jobs y'all have? What do you wear? Use any tailors? Where do you get your clothes?

My voice is so fucking high pitch, I could legit be in a children's cartoon for the squicky side kick (maybe that's my life purpose?). So I feel this pressure to be professional as a woman when interacting with customers (in terms of pitch of voice, actions, etc.). Like, it's so obvious to me that I emulate my mother rather than my father when I interact with customers. I thought of following advice that's out there to change my voice, but...I kinda don't? My squeakiness is my so part of me that I just want to keep it but be the professional that I /want/ to be. Uuuugh, i don't know how to explain it. Any thoughts?

Last bit, while my FB is in lock-down, there's the issue of LinkedIn. My side job is related to gender and sexuality advocacy so I have so much work experience in queer issues, but I have a whole other side of experiences in IT, design, coding, etc. Is it common to have two LinkedIn accounts? Any issues of employers seeing both? I mean, I guess if you don't use a picture then you could deny the other is you...but, having a picture is so common in LinkedIn. I've thought of going to my career center in my university to ask questions on resumes/linkedin since they put a lot of workshops on it, but I feel like it'll be the usual where the staff person just doesn't what to say because they see me as some rare fabled unicorn that they never thought they'll see in the wild.  

Side thing, but my side job is constantly asking all staff to post up a bio and pic to be more visible to the public and of course, I just so happen to be the only person who isn't cis who happens to be also the only one who has an issue with public pics of myself. Has anyone had any experience with this? I'm tired of having to remove myself from this job just because of future job concerns because I take pride in my work and well...my presence in my position.

So I feel this pressure to be professional as a woman when interacting with customers (in terms of pitch of voice, actions, etc.). Like, it\'s so obvious to me that I emulate my mother rather than my father when I interact with customers. I thought of following advice that\'s out there to change my voice, but...I kinda don\'t? My squeakiness is my so part of me that I just want to keep it but be the professional that I /want/ to be. Uuuugh, i don\'t know how to explain it. Any thoughts?\n\nLast bit, while my FB is in lock-down, there\'s the issue of LinkedIn. My side job is related to gender and sexuality advocacy so I have so much work experience in queer issues, but I have a whole other side of experiences in IT, design, coding, etc. Is it common to have two LinkedIn accounts? Any issues of employers seeing both? I mean, I guess if you don\'t use a picture then you could deny the other is you...but, having a picture is so common in LinkedIn. I\'ve thought of going to my career center in my university to ask questions on resumes/linkedin since they put a lot of workshops on it, but I feel like it\'ll be the usual where the staff person just doesn\'t what to say because they see me as some rare fabled unicorn that they never thought they\'ll see in the wild.  \n\nSide thing, but my side job is constantly asking all staff to post up a bio and pic to be more visible to the public and of course, I just so happen to be the only person who isn\'t cis who happens to be also the only one who has an issue with public pics of myself. Has anyone had any experience with this? I\'m tired of having to remove myself from this job just because of future job concerns because I take pride in my work and well...my presence in my position. \n\nSorry, while I am legit looking for advice, I think I ended up venting more than anything.

2015-08-06 20:34:26,3g1rgu,4,1,"I'm an AMAB non-cis person in my early twenties. 
 
So, I have been struggling with gender issues for about an year or so. I know I'm not cis, and yet struggle to decide what I am due to wanting to be true to myself. What I have read around the internet, it seems that many people who come to this realization automatically assume they are binary and not the gender they are assigned at birth, and thus are the other binary gender. 

For me this made sense and I thought of myself to also be this way. But then the confusion came. As I had identified with trans-women and thought I'm like them, I came to the realization that in my (obviously ignorant) mind a trans-woman was not the same thing as a woman at all. Thus I believe I had not read them correctly. Rather I had viewed trans-women as sort of being outside of the binary.

Similarily I cannot imagine myself to be a woman, in a sense that for example my mother and sisters are. I can't believe any cis-woman could be like I am. I know I'm feminine, but I can't help my mind being somehow male or without gender. I believe I have always been like this, and am somehow afraid of losing myself if I were to live solely as a woman. Trans-woman is better because it includes the possibility that the person is not a woman as AFAB women are, but if I would identify as that, would not it be offending to trans-women who see themselves as fully women?

As I explored my gender and identified as a trans-woman I tended to be pressured to think that any masculine or ""male""-labeled feeling is labeled such because of my life as a male, or as internalized sexism that women can't be masculine. I felt strange pressure to do this. But then I noticed that while I was thinking that a female can have any kind of masculine feeling ever, even wanting to have a penis, I didn't notice that I never did the same other way around. This I think is because I already had contributed to the traditional binary trans narrative, which claims that binary gender is somehow essential (my being not that which I had been assigned and thus the other one), and had not thought of any alternatives. Also I think this is highly encouraged, because transitioning ""just works"". This has still confused me to no end. 

Sometimes I came to the conclusion that I'm not a trans at all, and then felt really good about being a male and remembered moments in my life when I was feeling really good about being a man. I tend to think that if I was born a female, I would have gotten similarily dysphoric at some point. I don't believe my mind or soul or brain is essentially female in any sense, nor that I was meant to be a girl. I want to be able to be seen feminine, but it doesn't mean to be seen as a woman or all-female. I believe I could be seen as a ladyboy or anything that (btw for me a ""ladyboy"" or some similar being is the only form of androgyny coming from the male side that I know of) expresses femininity in a plausible way. 

Many seem to claim the main point to be comfortable, and to be outside the same as inside, and to be true to oneself, and to just be yourself. I don't know how I would be comfortable or to be myself. The idea of losing my body or getting by balls chopped is intuitively horrifying, but sometimes when dysphoric, I want to transition to the female body, but not to be female or woman, but to be feminine. Dressing as a woman feels good but the thought of everyone seeing me solely as a woman feels wrong in some way, because I feel trapped. Many times it also seems that masculinity is followed by pressure to be feminine. I have had this go both ways, sometimes after being really feminine some masculine energy flows back to my body strongly only to make it go the other way again.

Has anyone though similar things? I'm hoping for any kind of pointers or information.

Genderfluid is the closest thing I've come to describing how I feel, and I've been on a mild female swing (internally) for a few weeks now (probably the longest I've ever been this side of centre, but not the strongest).

For the last few years, I've had a small beard - I've long ago concluded my face needs it. However, I'm very critical of my beard-growing potential. My male side is quite happy with one, and wants it to look good. But sadly, my face disagrees, and usually I think any attempts at growing a beard, beyond the basic goatee I had until lately, look naff.

So after going clean shaven for the first time in years, a few weeks back, I've since attempt to grow a more substantial beard. However, my latest attempt, currently sitting at around a month, started to feel out of place in the last couple of days, so I decided I was going to get rid.

However, I have considerable peer pressure to keep my beard, as all I agree I look better with. So I decide to groom and style the beard a bit first, to see how it would look. And so now I'm stuck with a beard that I think looks awesome, when I'm also sitting here feeling I'd rather not have a beard at all.

2015-08-08 06:06:40,3g7vn6,2,7,"This is more of a confessional than a question, but I just feel like I need to put my thoughts down somewhere. 

My whole life I've been very confused/conflicted about my sexuality and my gender. I am AMAB but I have always had ""feminine mannerisms and interests."" When I was little I loved dressing up in my mom's clothes and would always wear her old dance costumes to put on shows with my cousin. My parents divorced when  I was 3 and I lived with my mom and little sister. I have always felt more comfortable around women than men, and just generally get along better with them. 

When  I was in high school I came out as bi, but after college and being exposed to a wider world view, I now Identify as queer. I dropped bi because I don't like it's reliance upon a gender binary, especially since I am particularly attracted to people who fall in the middle, though gender expression and identity really have no bearing on who I find attractive. 

Now that I feel like I understand my sexuality, I have started thinking about my gender identity. I definitely identify as male, though I don't feel like I identify as a man, if that makes any sense. I have a very feminine affect, which makes most people just assume I am gay. It's more than  that though. I love styles and fashions that are typically seen as feminine. I also feel really empowered when I dress in ways that challenge gender norms. This really started in high school. I loved the way thongs looked on women so I convinced my step mom to buy me some men's thongs. I started only wearing them around the house and on weekends, but eventually started wearing them full time. By the time I got to college, I was only wearing thongs and bikini briefs, but I was tired of paying a fortune for them and not being able to find them in my size. My girlfriend at the time was really supportive and encouraged me to try women's panties. After wearing that first pair, I never went back. At first I thought it might be a sexual thing or a fetish, but I realized that it wasn't that wearing panties turned me on, it was that they made me feel sexy. For, really the first time, I felt attractive. After that, I started wearing women's skinny jeans. Now I wear mostly men's slim fit jeans since they fit a bit better, but I recently started wearing leggings. I love wearing clothes that have feminine silhouettes and are especially feminine. I would love to wear dresses and skirts, but when I have, I felt like they don't look right. Unfortunately, my physical features are not feminine. I am fairly overweight, and have really thick facial and body hair, while balding at the age of 26.

This combination of issues has me really frustrated with my wardrobe. The looks I want to achieve, I can't pull off. I know I need to lose weight and I am hoping these realizations will help give me the motivation I need to get healthy, but in the meantime I wish I could fine a way to dress more feminine. The other issue that compounds the clothing conundrum is that I am a high school teacher in a fairly conservative area. I am the drama coach and have worn leggings to several rehearsals and my drama kids have been amazingly supportive. The one time I wore skinny jeans to work though, I overheard a lot of ignorant, childish comments. I'm fine with having two separate styles but it does get frustrating when I really want to get my nails done, but know I can't because of school. 

Anyway, I don't know what I am looking to get out of this, but it did feel good to manifest these thoughts in writing. Thanks for giving me a forum! 

Tldr - 26 years old, AMAB, exploring my gender identity and expression, trying to figure out how to be the truest me.

I know I need to lose weight and I am hoping these realizations will help give me the motivation I need to get healthy, but in the meantime I wish I could fine a way to dress more feminine. The other issue that compounds the clothing conundrum is that I am a high school teacher in a fairly conservative area. I am the drama coach and have worn leggings to several rehearsals and my drama kids have been amazingly supportive. The one time I wore skinny jeans to work though, I overheard a lot of ignorant, childish comments. I\'m fine with having two separate styles but it does get frustrating when I really want to get my nails done, but know I can\'t because of school. \n\nAnyway, I don\'t know what I am looking to get out of this, but it did feel good to manifest these thoughts in writing.

2015-08-08 07:57:56,3g83j3,4,3,"I'm trying to sort shit out, I hope you guys can help me understand both myself and the world better.

First, stuff about myself.  I'm 23, and a man though I have never actually identified personally with that notion.  I have realized recently that it is my personal sense of justice and my ideals that dictate pretty much everything I do, not my gender, and contrary to what I used to think, I'm not a very logical person at all, my gut is definitely captain of this ship.  The pursuit of beauty and truth are sacred to me above all else, and I would do anything for that quest.  When I need to be masculine and in control, I am, but naturally I am very gentle and more feminine.  I have no desire to control others or to be controlled, and I have as many masculine habits and hobbies as I do feminine ones.  In bed I care most about pleasing my partner, and am willing to do whatever to that end.  I am tall and athletic but have been mistaken for a female by cat calling males (they called me sexy and babe...I don't even know) a couple times since I grew my hair out down to my traps.  In High School I had thoughts about guys, once I got flushed and my heart rate shot up just from looking at a guy I only saw once, but as I have gotten older that's never happened since and I never went for anything cause raised Catholic (now agnostic).  I am now only attracted to girls, but I have a pretty good feeling that I would go for a guy if he was feminine enough, never had the chance to test that though.  Sometimes I imagine myself as a woman in my head, it's strangely calming and sometimes helps me understand what I need to do to satisfy my personal justice, and often I hate being treated or acting like a 'man'.  That being said, being a man or being a woman don't mean anything to me at all really, and in the end, I'm left a tad confused.

On to my current understanding of wtf gender is doing.  The ways I sees it, the binary is a load of shit that came about because it was easy, necessary even.  In a world of war and strife, two things mattered, strong soldiers and the means to make more.  Thus men fought and killed, and women made more poor sods to fill their shoes.  Derived from this, men naturally became solely providers and women homemakers.  Now that our world isn't quite so crazy, and these gender roles no longer necessary in the slightest, I feel that we will maybe create a new system of gender roles to suit what I believe are our natural social tendencies, as opposed to our biological imperatives.

If you're wondering wtf I want, I suppose I just want some feedback.  How should I think of myself, how should I get people to treat me like me and not like what they want me to be.  What do you think of my views, or rather, where do you think this whole trans queer shebang is heading?  What is this communities goal and endgame?

2015-08-11 23:08:58,3gnknd,3,6,"Hi, I'm FAAB and find it useful to call myself genderqueer. The gender I feel can vary on the day and moment. Sometimes male, sometimes female, sometimes other genders, sometimes a blend of genders, and sometimes I feel completely genderless. I experience body and social dysphoria. Often, but not always, unpleasant. It seems to me that many binary folks who experience dysphoria have a set path of changes: permanently changing their name, pronouns, and body. And if they do those things, the idea is that they will definitely probably help. My perception regarding that may be idyllic. For me, my gendered state is not permanent, so most options don't seem like they'd be useful to me. Additionally, each procedure comes with its own set of risks.

So I listened to a [Radiolab podcast](http://www.radiolab.org/story/invisibilia/) where they interviewed someone AMAB who switched between genders in a binary sort of way. However, when they checked in with her later she said she always felt female. This was attributed to her doing hormone therapy.

I'm wondering if my hormones are off and if taking estrogen will be the path of least resistance to having my gender bother me the least. I know some people take low doses to help with acne. Whereas testosterone will change me in ways I may or may not want and also fairly permanently.

For as long as I could remember I was a tomboy, even when I was very young. Most of my friends were boys and I would throw a fit when forced to wear girly clothes. Senior year of high school I was still with the same man and was pretty decidedly straight/cis (or so I thought). I wore tons of makeup, wore my hair down, wore a dress almost every day, etc. When I got to college, something changed. I started to wear less makeup, spent a lot of my time wearing sweatpants/basketball shorts and loose fitting t-shirts and looked pretty ""masculine"" as far as others thought. Everyone I met assumed I was gay, and I neither confirmed nor denied their assumptions. I broke up with with my boyfriend about a month into college. Now single, I began to get very confusing. Some days I'd wake up and do the same shit I used to do and look all feminine, but I'd feel strange all day. Most of the time I'd dress androgynously. I was still interested in men and women, consistently dating/seeing both. Recently I've been more comfortable dressing/looking androgynous, and while I'm dating a man, I've been finding myself more and more attracted to women (physically). I've started to identify as genderqueer, because I enjoy looking androgynous and I feel like I don't fit either of the traditional gender norms completely.

I started to wear less makeup, spent a lot of my time wearing sweatpants/basketball shorts and loose fitting t-shirts and looked pretty ""masculine"" as far as others thought. Everyone I met assumed I was gay, and I neither confirmed nor denied their assumptions. I broke up with with my boyfriend about a month into college. Now single, I began to get very confusing.

2015-08-18 04:45:40,3hep59,6,5,"**Hi. I recently posted this to AskGSM and was told to post here as well for more insight, so here it is.**  

I apologise for any mistakes I may make in posting this. I am inexperienced in posting things on Reddit. I also apologise if I use the incorrect terms; I am admittedly not well-versed in a lot of LGBTQ terminology, but I shall try my best. *This is a long post without a TL;DR that may be a pain to read so if that sounds like something you're not willing to deal with you should click out now.*  

As the title states, I am feeling increasingly confused. Over the years, I have gone through many self-discoveries and after every single one of them I've thought, ""That's it. There's nothing left. This is who I am."" But there's always something that comes after and poses a new question of my identity.

I haven't said how I identify yet, and that's because I'm finding it hard to pinpoint exactly *what* I am. I feel like I don't know the words. So what I'm going to do is describe to the best of my ability (keeping in mind that I'm not good with the terminology) what I thought of myself as a year ago, when I last felt like I knew all there was to know about myself. I suppose that I would have told you I am a cisgender, bisexual, transvestite, 19-year-old male.

I don't particularly like the term 'transvestite' as I feel that, ideally, clothes would not have to be assigned to any specific gender and there would be no question of anyone wearing a specific item (such as women wearing jeans now.) But I acknowledge that I have had an interest in wearing female clothing for most of my life. I am not a very fashion-conscious person and I am constantly wearing men's underwear, jeans, and a t-shirt. It's not uncommon for me to be interested in a some women's clothes though, and I find myself wishing I could wear them. In particular I have always wanted to wear a wedding dress, simply because I think they are elegant and beautiful (though I am indifferent to marriage itself).

This is coupled with some confusing bouts I have had with gender. I am a fan of video games, and since Pokemon FireRed I have always played as a girl when given the option. I can offer little explanation as to why this is except that I just prefer it to playing as a male.

I have also posed as a woman online in two instances. The first was in an online game, where I created an alternate account claiming to be a friend of myself that used my computer occasionally. The second was on a small forum created by an online friend. I was originally going to do it jokingly, but as a 14-year-old I pretended I was a 21-year-old woman who knew my online friend. Again, I can offer little explanation as to why I did these things. I simply wanted to at the time, and if I were to analyse it now I might say that perhaps I was exploring my own gender identity. I did not catfish anyone or anything like that; it was purely for myself.

I have been with my girlfriend, who is also bisexual, for almost two years now. I have disclosed everything that I have here with her. She is the only person I feel I can claim I have had any significant sexual or romantic attraction to in my life. I have found that on occasion I will feel quite jealous of her body, in the sense that I wish I could be as beautiful and feminine as she is. And I think that, hypothetically, if I could have her body as my own, I would be absolutely happy to do so.

I have tried wearing my girlfriends clothing (which she approves of) at times, but as she is very small and petite (5'1"") and I am tall and lanky (6'2"") I do not fit very well or at all in any of them. The best I've done is some of her stockings which make my legs feel sexy.

In many instances I have said that I am comfortable with being a man, and that I wouldn't mind being a woman, and I think this is true to some degree. Some days I find myself looking in the mirror and being proud of my appearance and masculine features I have. On others, which are fewer, I find myself upset that I am not more feminine and wishing that I could be a woman.

For the record, I do not attempt to appear androgynous in any way. I have grown out facial hair and do not wear make up, which kind of brings me to what has recently been bothering me...

I have always thought that makeup is unnecessary and I prefer when my girlfriend does not wear it, though she very rarely does anyway. However, recently on one of my 'wishful' days, I shaved my facial hair off and secretly used my mother's makeup, wondering how I would look. I inevitably did a poor job of applying it but I found that I was overjoyed to see how feminine I looked and felt with it. After admitting the incident to my girlfriend, she happily offered to help me put on makeup and we had fun doing so together.

I've rambled on a lot about all of these things that muddle my thoughts about my gender identity, and I feel like it should be clear to me how I should identify, but it isn't. I've never looked into LGBTQ communities, honestly, and I've previously felt like I did not need to bother with labels or terms, but the more I think about it, the more I become frustrated that I just don't seem to know what to call myself. It makes me feel like I don't know what to say when I explain these things about myself to other people except weak phrases such as ""I'm weird"" and ""I don't know"". I guess I wish I could safely say I was one thing or another, but I don't know enough to do so, and what I have read I feel like I can't relate to, which is strange. I feel like I'm too ignorant and that using any labels to describe myself would somehow be insulting those people, like people who self-diagnose mental disorders when they truly are able-minded.

Already in this post I feel like I must have said a number of things to offend any amount of people, as much as I hope that I haven't. Perhaps I'm being paranoid though.

long story short:


back then: born female, somewhat heterosexual (as in: not feeling real sexual attraction but having crushes over and over), heavy social phobia and depression


later: transition started, identifying as gay (as in: still no sexual attraction, but still having crushes), depression is gone, but still feeling insecure in a lot of social situations.


now: post-op ftm, but identifying as no-gender and realizing I might be asexual. No signs of depression and I don't mind being around people anymore.

I'm a rather happy person now, I enjoy life, but I feel incredibly alone.

I've never been in a relationship, am still a virgin. I never really did care as I was too busy figuring out both my sexual and gender identity. 

Now, that I know who I am and what I want I start feeling like there's hardly anyone out there that might fit my preferences as well as I most likely won't fit anyones preferences.

I'm an asexual post-op ftm identifying as no-gender who is into guys but doesn't really identify as gay... and I live in a rather smallish town...

2015-08-20 10:55:07,3hpdkk,13,11,"""Before I start, sorry if this gets a little long, I figure the more back story to my situation the better.

I was born and raised male, and for the most part I have been ok with that, but I feel like I am just now realizing that a piece of me is missing. I understood from a young age that I am attracted to females, my first crush what when I was in kindergarten. Growing up I liked typical ""male"" things like playing in the dirt and building things with legos, but a tiny piece of me also like pretty thing. I wanted a Barbie, I had no idea why I just though she looked pretty, so I am pretty sure these feeling stretch far back even if I don't know why or remember them that well.

I was never bullied, for being girly at least, and for the most part I seemed like a typical boy. I don't know why or how but I started avoiding girly things because I thought they weren't meant for me. TV shows that had lots of female characters like, Cardcaptor Sakura, Sailor Moon and the Powerpuff Girls thrilled and enchanted me, yet I felt like I had to watch them in secret otherwise people would think I'm weird.

My senior year in high school was the first time I watch the Rocky Horror Picture Show. I loved it, everything about it. It was like a whole new world had opened up to me. I wouldn't say I was homophobic, I was always open minded and accepting, but gay things up until then had made me feel very uncomfortable. I felt more open and eventually discovered pornography of the transsexual genre.

A few years later, around age 18 or 19 I discovered the comedian Eddie Izzard. I have always loved comedy, and to see a successful male transvestite... made me think. By now I had, in some capacity, already thought about potential trans things and admitted to myself I was potentially bisexual(I had no idea what pansexual was back then, such ignorance).

I bought some panties to wear, not in connection to anything sexual just to feel pretty. I had tried a bit of eye shadow, and some lipstick and foundation but shopping over the internet was less than fruitful. I was discouraged by makeup, and lack of opportunity to use it seeing as how I was still living with parents. I felt, nervous in ladies underwear but at the same time so incredibly powerful.

I put those things away and locked that part of me up when I met my second (now ex)girlfriend. Well years later I reopened the door to that part of me when a (former because she is a crazy lair)friend came out as trans. Told me about how she hates her body and wants to be a guy. Turns out that was a lie to make her self sound more interesting than she really was, but it was enough to re-spark my interest in self discovery. I experimented with guys, and loved it.

With the help of my then girlfriend now fiancée I tired crossdressing. I never really went out in public but did so in the company of a few friends, with mixed results. Apparently I ""look great until you get to my face."" Aside from that, while it scared the crap out of me I loved it.

But, eventually I stopped because it was a lot of work to get all dressed up when I had no place to go. I would still paint my toes every once in a while but that was about it.

For that last year my fiancée and I have moved back in with my mother, we lost my stepfather to cancer and agreed to move back to help her out.

Well, I recently discovered the movie Hedwig and the Angry Inch, and the spark or self discovery has been relit yet again and it now burns brighter and hotter than ever and I am having an existential crises because I realize that even at the age of 26 I have no clue about who or what I am. The best labels I have found are pansexual, gender fluid and occasional crossdresser, but those feel like just words. They don't feel like they have meaning. And I feel lost in this scary nebulous world I don't understand. I feel like a man, and a women, and like someone who is both and something not quite described by either. I don't think surgery or hormone treatments would be right for me because those would just change what I am physically into something physically different. I know, realistically, being both sexes at the same time isn't possible. There is no surgery or hormone treatment to add the genitals I wasn't born with to what I already have to work with. I don't feel myself go into girl mode very often or very strongly, but this now feels like something beyond ""boy mode"" and ""girl mode.""

This new flair up has left my fiancée feeling uncertain about our future(fiancée does love and support me in this, it is just a bit of culture shock for her), and with my current living arrangement I feel I have no future to explore my true self. I am lost in a sea of pain, scared and confused by my total lack of self understanding.""

- Stage One: Start telling close friends and trusted confidants one-on-one. I'm going to start the process in like mid-October (I'm Pagan, so Samhain (Halloween) has significance for me) and just take it slow. It may take me a few weeks, maybe longer (although I want to get to most people in this circle before the holidays, for obvious reasons). I'm going to ask them to keep it under their hats for the time being.

- Stage Two: Group hang-out with as many people in the aforementioned close friends circle as possible. I'm tentatively scheduling that for my birthday weekend (early March). A few days before then I'm going to do a bit of self care by treating myself to a salon day (mostly to get a rainbow swirl dye job I've wanted for a long while, but I'll also get a hair and beard trim) and picking up some makeup and nail polish. I'll show up with a more femme-y presentation and say, ""btw guys, it's okay to talk about this now.""

- Stage Three: Going public. Openly acknowledging, changing relevant info on social media, dealing with work, etc. (The last one will be weird because I freelance so there's no HR department to work with, which I guess means doing it on a client-by-client basis.)

I should say that there's already like 2 or 3 people who know, they're people I *deeply* trust and I told them a few months back because I was still in ""I'M SO CONFUSED SOMEBODY HALP"" mode and I needed to talk to *someone* about it. I call them my Alpha Testers. lol

So I think the part I'm struggling with most is the one-on-one convos. I'm trying to think of, like, an FAQ I can have in my head to respond to questions and I can't think of what I might be asked. (Other than ""are you sure?"", which I don't think will be asked but I'm working on a response just in case.) 

So, idk, what questions did people ask you when you came out? (Assuming you did come out, it's cool if you haven't!) What should I prepare for? Also, for a couple people in Stage One I had planned to tell them over coffee or brunch, but I'm not 100% sure if coming out in a public setting is a great idea and I'd like to hear your feedback on that.

2015-08-24 13:29:19,3i7769,1,17,"I am posting here to get input. I question maybe I am gender queer.  

I am told I am a handsome man.  I say gee thanks.  I have a hard time accepting that.  In my mind men who accept such things.  They are self centered and egotistical.

I think to myself.  It sure would be nice to be a woman.  In my mind, I would feel so much better.  I may never be them but I would be happier.

You know I lived as a woman.  I was born a boy.  I lived as a woman for 4 years.  Took E for about 5.  Developed breasts.  Become fem.  But more a Tomboy.  In the end you could say I was like a lesbian who was wearing denim shorts and T's.  Long hair and no or very little makeup.  I remember saying.  Wow you are not so fem after all.  You are more like the butch lesbians you admired.  I liked it.  Yet my genetic male body had feminized I felt like people would read me.

As time went on I felt like I was wrong.  As if I should not be here.  In the wee am hours I would go pee and sit and hear this thought or kind of voice in my head say ""I just don't know, I just don't know.""  What?  It sounded like my moms dad.  Where is this coming from?  Is this god?  Oh now whats going on?

Oh my god.  I then started thinking I was wrong for who I am.  For how I am living.  After all this society can be cruel some times.  When one doesn't have full passing privileges as a trans woman, they are at times on full on vigilance.  Who is it gonna be and are they gonna try to hurt me?  Sad huh?

I meet a Jehovahs witness.  Yay.  Not really.  I think maybe I am meant to go back and this person is a message to do just that.  I become a witness.  And yes I transition back.  Oh boy.  Oh no.  Wait.  Now they think I am gay or used to be gay and they treat me with homophobia.  Wait I am one of you.  But the male leadership.  Some of them don't treat me like one of the guys no matter what I do.  Oh no.  I feel betrayed.  All the things they told me.  They are not true.  I tried for almost a decade to prove myself.  To no avail.  I was a freak to some of the male leadership and would de treated this way as long as I am part of their faith.  It would follow me.  They network.  Sad.  I leave.

I am now back to living as a boy.

I had my breasts removed.  I have no testicles.

I am on T.  Masculinizing.  Hmm.  :/

I am now male.  Okay.  I pass okay.  Yet I don't feel male totally.  I try to live male.  I try to accept male.  Yet when I meet a woman as a male and she talks to me (as I am interpreting) like I am an egotistical walking erection I feel ashamed and I get upset.  I feel I am wrong for who I am.  I feel I am a bad person for being male.  I feel that if I was female I would be so much happier and fit in.  Yet my body now has issues. Health problems.  I struggle with my health.  I have lost over 100 pounds.  Wow.

If I could I would love to take E again.  I tried but got sick.  I cannot take T and E at the same time.  Coming off T is hard.  I have no gonads.  I feel stuck.

I wrote out on the white board in my therapist office.  Pre Trans woman.  Cutting, mutilation, attempts at amputation, masterbation and fantasizing being female, guilt, cross dressing and all other things that go along with trans.  

As a trans woman.  It all stopped.  Except wanting to be genetic female.  That was never gonna happen.

Wen I transitioned to being a boy.  Or a secondary trans male.  I developed a desire to be female again but not all the time.  I thought I could be happy as a boy.  Appreciate being boy.  In some ways I did, but I have a hard time accepting being stereotyped as a masculine man and treated like I am a walking erection or typical male.  I find it insulting.  It doesn't fit how I feel or who I want to be even as a male.  I get treated like I am expected to be a slob or a Neanderthal.  YUK!!  Stop please!  Ma'am I am not like that!  Please don't put me into that category.

I journal on my phone.  Identity now.  I make entries during the day.  Male, female or both.  Some male or some female.

It sucks.  There are two there.  I usually enter in the male name and the female name.

In some ways I like masculine.  It gets me privileges.  But in others I like the feminine.  It has things I love.  More than the masculine.  I like the fact that I can hide safely behind the male persona.  I won't get harassed.  But I prefer female.  At times, I wished I can be both.  Or androgynous.  Then choose.  Today I am...  Or I want to be this  ... today.  I want my breast back and want to look female.  And then again.  I enjoy the male presence as it is safe.  Yet I do not like the male role I feel men put me into when I am in their presence.  Competitive and talking about women in ways tat I find offensive.

Our brains seem to be programed in some way.  Our domestication, upbringing.  Society.  We are trained to think one or the other.  And even ourselves we struggle.  We know who we are yet we struggle thinking it has to be one or the other.  As if there is this Program or software virus saying no you have to be this or this.  You cant be both.  A primal brain thing.  I read some of your posts.  I wonder if our bodies are the issue.  Maybe out spark is one and the body is another.  Maybe we can have dual identity and they are separate yet bound to this reality?  Maybe it is reality that causes our confusion, reinforcing it constantly through visual and audible bombardment.  Maybe we struggle because we are a type of gender god in this society and we never really will fit in in our lifetime.  Even when we make efforts, in some way, we will still be our worse enemy.

I try to think.  I am a woman in a male survival suit with a PhD in masculinity.  Hmm.  :-/  Does that fit?  I think the jury is still out in that one.

I may never be them but I would be happier.\n\nYou know I lived as a woman.  I was born a boy.  I lived as a woman for 4 years.  Took E for about 5.  Developed breasts.  Become fem.  But more a Tomboy.  In the end you could say I was like a lesbian who was wearing denim shorts and T\'s.  Long hair and no or very little makeup.  I remember saying.  Wow you are not so fem after all.  You are more like the butch lesbians you admired.  I liked it.  Yet my genetic male body had feminized I felt like people would read me.\n\nAs time went on I felt like I was wrong.  As if I should not be here.  In the wee am hours I would go pee and sit and hear this thought or kind of voice in my head say ""I just don\'t know, I just don\'t know.""  What?  It sounded like my moms dad.  Where is this coming from?  Is this god?  Oh now whats going on?\n\nOh my god.  I then started thinking I was wrong for who I am.  For how I am living.  After all this society can be cruel some times.  When one doesn\'t have full passing privileges as a trans woman, they are at times on full on vigilance.  Who is it gonna be and are they gonna try to hurt me?  Sad huh?\n\nI meet a Jehovahs witness.  Yay.  Not really.  I think maybe I am meant to go back and this person is a message to do just that.  I become a witness.  And yes I transition back.  Oh boy.  Oh no.  Wait.  Now they think I am gay or used to be gay and they treat me with homophobia.  Wait I am one of you.  But the male leadership.  Some of them don\'t treat me like one of the guys no matter what I do.  Oh no.  I feel betrayed.  All the things they told me.  They are not true.  I tried for almost a decade to prove myself.  To no avail.  I was a freak to some of the male leadership and would de treated this way as long as I am part of their faith.  It would follow me.  They network.  Sad.  I leave.\n\nI am now back to living as a boy.\n\nI had my breasts removed.  I have no testicles.\n\nI am on T.  Masculinizing.  Hmm.  :/\n\nI am now male.  Okay.  I pass okay.  Yet I don\'t feel male totally.  I try to live male.  I try to accept male.  Yet when I meet a woman as a male and she talks to me (as I am interpreting) like I am an egotistical walking erection I feel ashamed and I get upset.  I feel I am wrong for who I am.  I feel I am a bad person for being male.  I feel that if I was female I would be so much happier and fit in.  Yet my body now has issues. Health problems.  I struggle with my health.  I have lost over 100 pounds.  Wow.\n\nIf I could I would love to take E again.  I tried but got sick.  I cannot take T and E at the same time.  Coming off T is hard.  I have no gonads.  I feel stuck.\n\nI wrote out on the white board in my therapist office.  Pre Trans woman.  Cutting, mutilation, attempts at amputation, masterbation and fantasizing being female, guilt, cross dressing and all other things that go along with trans.  \n\nAs a trans woman.  It all stopped.  Except wanting to be genetic female.  That was never gonna happen.\n\nWen I transitioned to being a boy.  Or a secondary trans male.  I developed a desire to be female again but not all the time.  I thought I could be happy as a boy.  Appreciate being boy.  In some ways I did, but I have a hard time accepting being stereotyped as a masculine man and treated like I am a walking erection or typical male.  I find it insulting.  It doesn\'t fit how I feel or who I want to be even as a male.  I get treated like I am expected to be a slob or a Neanderthal.  YUK!!  Stop please!  Ma\'am I am not like that!  Please don\'t put me into that category.\n\nI journal on my phone.  Identity now.  I make entries during the day.  Male, female or both.  Some male or some female.\n\nIt sucks.  There are two there.  I usually enter in the male name and the female name.\n\nIn some ways I like masculine.  It gets me privileges.  But in others I like the feminine.  It has things I love.  More than the masculine.  I like the fact that I can hide safely behind the male persona.  I won\'t get harassed.  But I prefer female.  At times, I wished I can be both.  Or androgynous.  Then choose.  Today I am...  Or I want to be this  ... today.  I want my breast back and want to look female.  And then again.  I enjoy the male presence as it is safe.  Yet I do not like the male role I feel men put me into when I am in their presence.  Competitive and talking about women in ways tat I find offensive.\n\nOur brains seem to be programed in some way.  Our domestication, upbringing.  Society.  We are trained to think one or the other.  And even ourselves we struggle.  We know who we are yet we struggle thinking it has to be one or the other.  As if there is this Program or software virus saying no you have to be this or this.  You cant be both.  A primal brain thing.  I read some of your posts.  I wonder if our bodies are the issue.  Maybe out spark is one and the body is another.  Maybe we can have dual identity and they are separate yet bound to this reality?  Maybe it is reality that causes our confusion, reinforcing it constantly through visual and audible bombardment.  Maybe we struggle because we are a type of gender god in this society and we never really will fit in in our lifetime.  Even when we make efforts, in some way, we will still be our worse enemy.\n\nI try to think.  I am a woman in a male survival suit with a PhD in masculinity.  Hmm.  :-/  Does that fit?  I think the jury is still out in that one.\n\nThanks for reading.  :-)', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'ID Gender Queer?', 'created': 1440448159.0}"

 * People will think I'm doing this to get attention

This is my biggest fear. I'm worried I might be making too big a show of it, that people might dismiss me or feel uncomfortable around me because I'll be ""the person that made a huge deal about coming out for nothing"".

2015-08-31 17:00:38,3j3t5y,14,26,"CW: transmisogyny (from an afab trans person)

Hey all. Throwaway account for gender stuff, because this is something that has bothered me for at least a few years now.


I'm non-binary, afab, 21. Honestly I don't feel like my gender is impacted by my birth gender--so like, I'd be non-binary always regardless, and having the gender would feel the same even if dysphoria would be different. 


What gets me is that like... so obvs when trying to figure out how your gender&amp;dysphoria work, you often ""picture an ideal version of yourself"" right? And for me... like, I know this wording isn't great, but the best way I can find to phrase it is always like, ""my ideal version of me would be a non-op trans woman on HRT""?


Like I have pretty bad dysphoria over my hips and shoulders (or lack thereof) and hand and foot size, over my genitals (especially this, probably in part because I know there's No Fix atm), some over my chest (that's been getting worse, but it's Complicated tbh). My bone structure drives me nuts and made me want to die a lot over the past few months.


But skin and some things with body hair and less muscle mass and idk, I know this list sounds shorter but that's because I have many of those features already so I don't think about them so much, but just a lot of physically ""female"" traits and then, the ability to engage in ""girl"" things without judgement (which isn't related to/restricted by gender I know but still), is also a huge desire. 


It all kind of coalesces into me feeling like my physical body should be the 'opposite' and I should have been able to make modifications from there, instead of the other way around, where most modifications I can make via medicine/etc. just fuck shit up more and most of the things I need to change I can't. But I've never heard anyone else feel this way, so I was wondering if people do, or if it's just me? Like is it not just a ~weird nonbinary thing~ but actually just a ""weird me thing""?


The worst thing for me about this, outside of it just makes the dysphoria and anger worse, is it makes me irrationally jealous of a lot of my friends who are trans women. Like, I'm obviously friends with them just because I enjoy them as people and gender is secondary, but it doesn't mean if we're hanging out that I won't be struck with this really stupid mess of uncomfortable, jealous feelings like ""wow fuck you I want this I want that so badly please,"" and it is awful to feel that way about people I love (especially when they're talking about their transitions, which I should be thrilled for them for! but instead I'm just jealous?? in ways that don't even make sense since like, duh, I don't want spiro or e but my brain feels confused). I'm FWB with a girl right now who's trans and like, it's mostly chill and we talk a lot about gender and body shit re: both of us, but there are still moments I just get so stupidly jealous of her body (which feels even worse than just being jealous of other people because I know pretty intimately how awful that body is for her).


**tl;dr: I'm angry at myself for having the wrong body in a way that is not fixable, and also am jealous of people I care about. How do I deal with that/advice in general on this stuff?**

Throwaway account for gender stuff, because this is something that has bothered me for at least a few years now.\n\n\nI\'m non-binary, afab, 21. Honestly I don\'t feel like my gender is impacted by my birth gender--so like, I\'d be non-binary always regardless, and having the gender would feel the same even if dysphoria would be different. \n\n\nWhat gets me is that like... so obvs when trying to figure out how your gender&amp;dysphoria work, you often ""picture an ideal version of yourself"" right? And for me... like, I know this wording isn\'t great, but the best way I can find to phrase it is always like, ""my ideal version of me would be a non-op trans woman on HRT""?\n\n\nLike I have pretty bad dysphoria over my hips and shoulders (or lack thereof) and hand and foot size, over my genitals (especially this, probably in part because I know there\'s No Fix atm), some over my chest (that\'s been getting worse, but it\'s Complicated tbh). My bone structure drives me nuts and made me want to die a lot over the past few months.\n\n\nBut skin and some things with body hair and less muscle mass and idk, I know this list sounds shorter but that\'s because I have many of those features already so I don\'t think about them so much, but just a lot of physically ""female"" traits and then, the ability to engage in ""girl"" things without judgement (which isn\'t related to/restricted by gender I know but still), is also a huge desire. \n\n\nIt all kind of coalesces into me feeling like my physical body should be the \'opposite\' and I should have been able to make modifications from there, instead of the other way around, where most modifications I can make via medicine/etc. just fuck shit up more and most of the things I need to change I can\'t.

* I wear 1"" inseam short shorts as you see on the photos. I have no problem wearing those but I'd also like to wear things like thigh highs, shorts that look like skirts, tank tops, etc. Im still collecting the courage to wear the latter things.
