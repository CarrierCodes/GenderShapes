Now, I obviously have my own experiences to go on, but I want more perspectives, voices, experiences, even horror stories if you feel comfortable sharing. This isn't autobiographical or biographical, it is completely fiction; however what you share could be used as inspiration for what happens to the character. I want to make it as fictional as possible but I will let you know if I will be using a situation that hits very close to what you shared with me to make sure that is okay. The very last thing I want to do is plagiarize the lives of you beautiful people and make you feel like I used you. I would share bits and pieces as they come into completion in order to get feedback from the community to make sure I do a good job of representing who we are. Even if you identify as genderqueer and not fluid, your story could still be very valuable!

Everyone would of course be credited in the preface of the piece even if it's just something I post online, whether you wish to mentioned as ""a lovely reddit contributor"", ""u/soandso"" or ""insertyournamehere"". Even if you want to remain completely anonymous I'm okay with that. If by some one in a billion chance I ever got published I would give you guys copies too. lol.
I just want a deeper look into the life of a genderfluid/genderqueer person, beyond my closeted experiences to bring to light the problems we experience in romance, life, careers, friendships and more to really create a rich, emotional and even educational piece of writing for those who don't know what it means to be genderfluid.
So if you are interested, give me a PM. If this garners enough interest, I'll set up an email account to receive your stories.
Please send me your name (if you want, remember this can be COMPLETELY anonymous), age, where you live(could be as vague as a country or as specific as a city. I'm not a stalker, I just want to learn about experiences also as they relate to location) and then whatever you wish to share with me about your life as a Genderfluid/genderqueer person.
Thank you so so much for reading and I'm sorry this is so long! I hope to be reading lots in the coming days and for anyone that submits I love you, and I wish I could give you a kitten.

2015-07-01 03:20:50,3bpm4q,0,0,"Been trying to understand all my piercings as I transition.

My sack is small and what I have left easily moves out of the way.  My dick has always been small, though I have always satisfied my partners in that regard.

Two more frenums on the bottom completed what I now have.  All have been upgraded to 8g with heavy 1/4 and ½ inch end balls.

Now my cock rings out as I walk! And, hangs between my legs.

My nipples are easier to understand - they are so much bigger than they once were. At 8g, the black niobium rings with 1/4 inch stainless steel captive beads, swing as I walk and jolt me to remember their sensuous presence.

How could I not help the fall of crystal that hangs from my navel.

2015-07-01 06:01:08,3bq2f1,19,9,"I am a male, but I find myself wishing that I had a body that is  feminine. In other words, more curvy, less muscle mass/definition, softer features, wider hips, smaller shoulders, smooth skin, no body hair, etc. However I do *not* desire a sex change or to grow breasts. Basically, I'm seeking to combine male primary sexual characteristics with female secondary sexual characteristics. 

This desire presents itself in the form of dysphoria. I feel unattractive and ugly with a masculine body. I don't like being hairy, muscular, and burly. I would much rather look sexy and curvy and cute.   

Sometimes the dysphoria is a vague desire, but other times it's so severe that I have panic attacks, cry, or get depressed all day long. Thankfully, it's very rare for it to be that bad. 

Anyway, I'm not sure what my gender identity is. We call men who are happy with their masculine body cisgender, and their gender identity is male. We call men who want a woman's body transgender, and their gender identity is female. 

But it's not so easy when someone wants a combination body. So what in the world would you call somebody like this? I'm not happy having a body that is 100% male, but at the same time it's not as if I'm saying that I want a 100% female body, that I'm a woman, or that I want to be a woman. The body I want isn't a man's, but neither is it a woman's. It's something that combines qualities of both. I have no idea what you would classify this body as. As far as I know, no one has ever named it. 

Like, for example, would you say it's male because it has male genitals and flat chest? Or would you get technical and say it's not really a man because it has female traits?

The thing is though that I don't believe I'm a woman at all. I believe I'm a male, because I am. To my perspective, I don't see why someone can't be like this and still be a guy. But at the same time this dysphoria isn't something normal cis guys struggle with either.  

Anyway, what's my gender identity? Man, mtf transwoman, bigender, androgyne, gender fluid, third gender, genderqueer, or something else? To be honest I don't understand most of these at all. All of these gender identities are very confusing and vague to me.

I don't really get what genderqueer means so I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to post this question. Somebody referred me to here saying you might be able to help so I thought I'd give it a go. 

I'd really appreciate your help. I'm at my wits end and I think I've tried everything else already. Thanks in advance for your responses.

2015-07-02 01:24:04,3btmio,8,19,"So my story is that I am AMAB and for a year I was hellbent on full transition. And then once I finally got on T-blockers my emotions went wild, and I was dealing with relationship issues and loneliness and I decided to stop a month later. I started again a month after that only to stop once more. Now here I am looking at the bottle of t-blockers that I picked up yesterday and I'm terrified. 

Because so often I find myself wanting so badly to have a feminine body. But I'm afraid I'm making the wrong decision for myself. I'm worried about having to take meds for the rest of my life. I'm worried that I won't be as attractive to as many people (which is a ridiculous thing to worry about when it comes to trying to love yourself, but seriously my ego and vanity is a massive problem). 

Then on the flipside I'm terrified of every day that I'm not taking hormones or at least T-blockers, because I get that little bit more masculine; testosterone poisoning is relentless. I feel that every day I wait is a day that will make hormone treatment less effective. I'm currently just paralyzed in fear of both taking hormones and not taking them and I have no idea what I'm doing. My therapist hasn't gotten back to me about my appointment which is why I guess I'm freaking out on reddit; sorry about that. 

I wish that I identified as some sort of binary, because that would make the decision easy. But the problem is I find myself so often day dreaming lately about having femme characteristics but my voice never changes. My voice is something that I don't think I could ever change or train, simply because it's a huge part of who I am as a musician.

2015-07-02 03:46:05,3bu1k7,4,3,"Okay... So mentally, I can very comfortably feel how I feel, but when it comes to verbalizing it I am at a complete loss for words. I don't care about the judgement I'll receive at all, I just don't know how to define it, so I need some help. Here it goes.

My sexuality is definitely bisexual, but I am more picky about men than I am women. I generally watch straight porn just because it's easier to find someone I'm attracted to. Most gay porn or even solo dude stuff, the guys are either too jacked, or too skinny for me to be attracted to. I like athletic guys, but not someone who's super muscular.

Physically, I'm male, and am comfortable in my body as a male. I'm tall, blonde, grey eyes, and a strong facial structure. I LOVE my body. Mentally though I'm a mix of genders. I even have a social media account that I switch between male/female on using the excuse that the male is ""my boyfriend"" and the female is the girlfriend so that I can be both at times whenever I want.

I'm not at all interested in doing any kind of conversion though. I'm very happy as a male, and am not at all repressed or shy. I'm kind of normal. I like sports, am approachable, but am definitely not a pushover and will defend myself if I have to.

2015-07-02 03:58:36,3bu2w5,4,3," I am someone who identifies as genderfluid. However, one of my closest friends believes that I am not genderfluid. This isn't because he dislikes people who identify as genderfluid or anything, he's a feminist and accepts people and is very open minded. The reason why he believes I'm not genderfluid is because he knows my history with my ex, and believes that I'm only lying to myself out of pain and internal misogyny. 

 Let me explain. I once dated someone who was emotionally abusive and overall a jerk. This links to my current issue because he dumped me for his male best friend and from here on went back and forth from me to him, constantly telling me he's gay one day and then not another day. From this experience, I remember that I hated myself for being female and that I desperately wanted to be male so that he would love me. At one point I did wonder if I was genderfluid, but I decided that I only wanted to be male to make my ex happy. A few months passed and before I finally began to officially identify as genderfluid I tried identifying as a guy for a day. It was overall very nice and I felt comfortable, and I decided that male or female or no gender at all, I really didn't mind what my gender was and began to identify as genderfluid. My friend, however, is not convinced.

 The reason he's so adamant on it is because he thinks lying to myself is damaging and that I need to accept the facts. He also thinks that I have internalized misogyny and that I also need to fix that issue after I accept that I'm not genderfluid. However, I feel comfortable the way I am now, and even if I don't feel dysphoria anymore, I believe I am genderfluid simply because I'm comfortable as any gender I identify as. And that's why I need opinions, because I'm not too sure myself and I promised my friend to think about it and be honest to myself.

We're staying together as this doesn't bother me at all, I've always been a huge supporter of the LGBTQ community and I'm very happy for her! :) 

However over the past month I've been trying to re-figure out my identity, since I went from thinking I was a straight woman to realizing I'm totally not. I think this has to do a lot with me suppressing and trying to fit in with the straight women community for YEARS and never being able to. (I've always been a tomboy and have masculine features, sometimes I get mistaken for a transwomen/or called a lesbian because I guess people think I look that way?) So now that I've actually been confronted with thinking about my gender/sexuality (instead of assuming I am straight and cis which is what I've always told I am/should be) I've been able to realize I'm definitely NOT straight and now I'm realizing.... maybe also not so cis. 

I don't exactly know how to explain it but I feel totally free now that she's come out to me and I know soon/eventually I'll be in a lesbian relationship in society's eyes. I feel like I don't have to hide/play down the things about me that were more ""lesbian"" or ""boyish"" like I used to. 

And then I found the term genderqueer and BAM. I feel like I identify with being genderqueer above all else. (Specifics like agendr, etc I don't know if I'm into, I like the term genderqueer because its non-specific) I don't mind being a woman or labeled as such or she pronouns but I also don't feel like totally a woman or a man. I enjoy looking androgynous and I just feel freer now that I realize I don't have to try to be a cis straight women. Its awesome. 

I am scared though to tell my girlfriend. It's not that I don't think she'll be accepting, but I'm just worried she won't believe me or something. I want to share with her how amazing and helpful it's been to be able to figure these things out about myself, but I'm nervous to do it!

I also found [Chrysalis Lingerie](http://www.chrysalislingerie.com/) (beware of the autoplay music) and an Etsy shop called [LeoLines]( https://www.etsy.com/listing/156470529/sample-pair-reduced-price-transgender); both sell feminine underwear for people with penises, though the Etsy shop is only selling them while they last.\n\nWhat do you recommend for people who want underwear not necessarily shaped for their bodies?\n\nEdit: a word"", 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'In search of underwear', 'created': 1436007528.0}"

I was AFAB but always knew I was a little different.  I didn't like ""girl"" things and I did ""boy"" things instead.  Looking back now, there was more naunce than such a black-and-white statement would suggest.  Anyway, I thought I was a lesbian and then I was introduced to trans* and I began hormonally transitioning in high school. Before I was eighteen, I had surgery to remove my breasts.  The result was (and still is) not pretty and it brings me a lot of shame. 

I went to college and learned a lot--about myself and about my values.  In the summer between sophomore and junior year, I stopped taking hormones and began to detransition hormonally.  It's been a year since then.

I have come out to myself and my family as genderqueer.  This is a little different than how I came out as FTM (over facebook... god); this time, I don't feel it is as important to make a statement.  

I have a lot of regret about my transition and a lot of envy.  I wish I had given myself time to grow up, to celebrate myself.  I thought at this point in my life, I would be okay.  I have a lot of trouble with my clothing (not enough nice things!) and with wearing more feminine clothing in public.  I am also very uncomfortable with my male privilege and secondary sex characteristics (hair).  On the flip side, I'm uncomfortable expressing all of this--I've never experienced harassment for being a woman and I feel like gross impostor for even wanting to feel pretty and feminine.

Since detransitioning, I haven't felt very masculine at all.  If anything, the most ""masculine"" I feel is a confident neutrality in my gender.  A large part of me identifies with femininity.

I'm not really asking for advice--though I would welcome any!--I am just expressing.  It seems too overwhelming to completely detransition (but I think about it a lot).  Learning to express myself without fear seems like an easier step.

I've been yo-yo-ing and ping-pong-ing on this one for many years, but I've finally come out to myself as ~~Neutrois~~ Genderqueer/Agender. (sorry for the edit. I've since learned that Neutrois usually means body dysphoria which I do not have.)

I've had a lot of pent-up sexual dysfunction that finally resolved once I uncovered the memory of my childhood rape. Since then, all the back -and-forth-ing I've been experiencing snapped into focus and I started doing some researching.

Turns out there are a lot of resources. Lots of forums and a lot of LGBTQ groups to join. There is also a lot of latent anger toward straight males, and I'm more than a bit afraid to dip my toe into those waters. There was one thread at TransYada in particular that came across as bitter and biased.

So would TransYada be an okay place to do some research? Or Susan's Place? Laura's Playground.

Are there other, more inclusive sites that anyone can recommend?

I could really use some suggestions.

2015-07-10 19:28:39,3ctz2k,4,13,"Hey everyone, this is actually my first ever post on the site. I've been hanging around for a while but I finally decided to make an account because of this sub. So, nice to meet you all :)

Unfortunately I'm here to make a serious post. First, the whole ""background of my gender ID"" thing. I've been questioning my gender for a long while now. I'm pretty solid with thinking of myself as ""nonbinary"" at this point, but I haven't found any more specific labels that fit perfectly yet. I've considered a lot of things, and I still have a lot of insecurity at times but I am always 100% sure that I don't ever want to be considered a woman (I'm dfab). I'm lucky enough to mostly fit into society's ""ideal androgynous person"" look, and I try to present as neutrally as possible. Most of my close friends, including my partner know I am questioning but I haven't officially come out yet. I am using she/her pronouns in my everyday life but I would actually prefer to switch to they/them, I'm a little insecure about people not taking me seriously but I am sure my friends will be cool with it and I plan to ask them soon.

The problem is I am scared to talk to my partner about it. They are also dfab, nonbinary and transgender. They are further on the masculine side of the gender spectrum than I am. We both love each other and I know it is very irrational to be afraid. But there's some things from the past that are holding me back. They know I've been questioning for a long time. I think when they came out to me before we were dating, that may have been the catalyst for my own realization because before then I still sort of had the idea (like many GQ people I'm sure) that as a dfab person I had to be FTM and since I wasn't, I had to be a girl. I confided in them that I was questioning and couldn't figure out if what I was feeling was because I was nonbinary or if I was just a girl who isn't feminine. They told me right away I was probably just not feminine but still cis. This was about a year and a half ago and since then I have had the opportunity to explore myself further, change my presentation to fit me further, I even bought a binder to try it out (I don't need it every day but some days it is definitely nice to have). I'm sure now I'm not cis (though I find it difficult to take the label of trans, because I feel like I don't have much in common with a lot of them, but that might just be because I'm nonbinary. I still have a ways to go as you can see). I'm still scared that if I tell my partner, they'll shut me down again like they did way back then. They've also expressed some frustration in the past about how being trans is ""becoming a trend"" and all of that. One time they said stuff about that I got upset and they said they would do better to be understanding of how I feel. But I'm really unsure that they've changed their opinion. I'm scared because they have physical dysphoria that is very major and causes them a lot of pain. I have given my support but as we are long-distance, it's hard for me to give them physical items (like a binder) that might help. Even if I could, they work long hours so it may not even be possible at this time for them to bind safely. My own gender feelings (I hesitate with the label of dysphoria as well because it's not debilitating) mostly involve my clothes and presentation (which as I previously explained, I have already mostly hit my ideal with that) and a tiny bit about my chest (mostly in social situations) and sex organs (only figured that one out when I had a gyno appointment and was shaking uncontrollably after the doctor left so I could put my clothes on). Since theirs is causing them a lot of pain and suffering I am nervous that they will think mine isn't real or be resentful of me for not suffering as they do. We haven't really talked about my gender since I got upset at them that one time. I think they are waiting for me to bring it up myself but I don't know if I can, I am just too anxious about it all. I don't want to keep it in (hence this post) but I can't push past these mental blocks either.

I don't want to paint a bad picture of my SO, I am sure we could work through it even if it went badly at first, they are a really great person and I love them and I know they love me too. We have a great relationship and communicate well for the most part about our feelings, their mental health issues and everything important. I feel terrible that I need to post this online to strangers before I tell them, but I just can't overcome this anxiety. I just need to talk about it with some third parties and maybe it will help me gain courage.

TL;DR my partner is nonbinary, after they came out I began to question my own gender, now I am sure I am nonbinary as well but because of past disbelief, medicalist ideas, etc. on their part as well as the fact that their dysphoria is objectively much worse than mine I am too afraid to come out fully to them without help.

2015-07-11 01:41:36,3cv9ix,5,6,"Hi r/genderqueer! Im a 16 year old trans girl*, but im still having a lot of daily confusion about my gender identity. I decided I was trans a little over a year ago, but things havent been any clearer for me. 

I feel like I *want* to be female, and when I see people say things like ""Im ok being treated and referred to as female"" i get a feeling like its something i want/should have. I dont have any kind of phantom genitals, and i dont mind mine as long as literally nobody but me knows they exist, but otherwise im like, 100% i want/should have a female body with female secondary sex characteristics. I want people to see me as female. And that sounds simple enough?? But its not. 

Internally, I misgender myself a lot, like echoing in my head whenever i gender myself correctly. I have constant obsessive thoughts (literally probably equivalent to pure-obsessional intrusive thoughts), like ""the thing you just said/did is something a boy would say/do so youre really a boy!"" and a constant fear that nobody *really* sees me as female, and that im a fraud whos ""pretending to be a girl"" even though all i want IS to just *be* a girl. I guess i also have a lot of masculine personality traits... i intentionally developed them as a child because i thought I had to and it seriously disgusts me. My inner voice is also masculine and it feels so invalidating. Most of my interactions because its summer have been with my family who thinks im a boy and refers to me and treats me as one, so could that impact on my self image?

-

Basically, Maybe my personality might be appropriate for a boy but i REALLY REALLY dont want to be a boy. I just ""feel like a boy maybe"" and it takes a LOT of self talk before i can start to feel like a girl. 

So I guess what im asking is, how much should I pay attention to those things when considering my true gender identity? Can I change those things about myself (and how?) and will I still be authentic (real) and valid? Would those things make me not female (at least partially), and should I consider identifying differently, like maybe bigender? 

Thank You!!

2015-07-12 05:12:55,3czjms,2,10,"So I'm mostly posting my story because I want to get it out in the open for people and, well, I could use some support during this time. It's time to come out of the closet, and it's going to be a complicated coming out. Just about every person in my life is going to be surprised in some way.

I am 34 amab. When I was 20, I began coming out to selected people I felt safe with as bisexual. It was a time when my friends from high school had left for college and I found what I felt was intense support within the gay world. But some people in the gay world exhibited biphobia towards me and called me a fence sitter or confused and such. I didn't want to lose the gay world so I felt the need to conform and started identifying as gay. I think I even believed I was gay at one time. I've lived like that, convincing myself I wasn't really attracted to anyone but men, until fairly recently when I started reading queer theory. I realized I couldn't deny it any longer.

Along the way, I started realizing that I don't always feel like a man. I realized that I'm a male presenting genderqueer, specifically a demiboy. I've started experimenting with different ways to express gender and I've come to realize that I really like being a gender outlaw. It's become part of who I am.

I've never told most of my family, including my mother. I don't believe my mother will reject me, but a part of me has been scared to death. I don't want to lose her and even the slightest possibility of that destroys me inside. I don't have a good relationship with my father so she's been my primary parental figure for many years. Much of the rest of my family are extremely politically conservative and regularly post anti-queer stuff on Facebook. I don't really care what they think but I haven't wanted them to get it back to my mom.

Most of my friends and colleagues believe I'm gay. Very few of them know I'm genderqueer and almost none of them know I'm bisexual. 

It gets even more complicated. I'm a minister with a very open and affirming religion. I've just been called to a congregation in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, a very rural and conservative area. They thought they were calling a cis gay minister. I thought they were calling a cis gay minister at the time. I think they will support me. My fear is they will feel deceived when I start to talk about all this.

I don't know what I want out of this post. If you have experiences or advice to share with me, I'm more than open to listening. Mostly, though, I need to be heard right now and I need to know other people hear my fear. It could all come crashing down on me...it's a very unlikely chance, but still possible.

I'm sure I've left stuff out. If there's anything confusing in all this or you have a question, feel free to let me know as well.

It's time to come out of the closet, and it's going to be a complicated coming out. Just about every person in my life is going to be surprised in some way.\n\nI am 34 amab. When I was 20, I began coming out to selected people I felt safe with as bisexual. It was a time when my friends from high school had left for college and I found what I felt was intense support within the gay world. But some people in the gay world exhibited biphobia towards me and called me a fence sitter or confused and such. I didn't want to lose the gay world so I felt the need to conform and started identifying as gay. I think I even believed I was gay at one time. I've lived like that, convincing myself I wasn't really attracted to anyone but men, until fairly recently when I started reading queer theory. I realized I couldn't deny it any longer.\n\nAlong the way, I started realizing that I don't always feel like a man. I realized that I'm a male presenting genderqueer, specifically a demiboy. I've started experimenting with different ways to express gender and I've come to realize that I really like being a gender outlaw. It's become part of who I am.\n\nI've never told most of my family, including my mother. I don't believe my mother will reject me, but a part of me has been scared to death. I don't want to lose her and even the slightest possibility of that destroys me inside. I don't have a good relationship with my father so she's been my primary parental figure for many years. Much of the rest of my family are extremely politically conservative and regularly post anti-queer stuff on Facebook.

2015-07-12 06:18:45,3czoud,4,6,"Man... So let me start by explaining just a little bit, because I'm mega confused. 

Recently, like the beginning of this year, I've been feeling feelings. I'm starting off when I first started to feel this way, like openly in my mind (started back in December 2014). I had chopped off all my hair and moved back into my mom's place, then got my first job. My head was shaved nearly bald, so I had no hair. I've always thought of myself as a generally feminine person, but then I would look at myself with my short hair and my baggy shirt and I loved it. 

Now, I'm not saying feminine people can't have short hair and baggy clothes, but this was a new feeling. At work I had started to be called 'sir' and 'young man'... And I didn't mind it. 

One thing that confused me, though, was that other than my short hair I had thought that I looked 'obviously female', as I'm a bigger girl with... feminine body parts. But I didn't think about it too much. Then I started having dreams where I would have male parts, ya know? The first dream I had was just last month. This all seems obvious to me now, it's hard to explain but it just seems normal. Like all my childhood I hadn't always felt /fully/ female.. I really don't know how to explain this. Are any of y'all getting this? Hm. 

But here's the thing, right? So I have those feelings. I'll look in the mirror and pretend I didn't have boobs and shit, but it's not always like that. Sometimes I love the way I look (disregarding my self-esteem issues for this explanation) and I'm perfectly fine with my body parts. 

Anyway.. I bought a binder... I feel like I wouldn't go as far as to purchase something if these weren't real feelings I am having, you know? So, I'll see how I feel with that on. 

Does anyone have any idea what this could be? Is it totally a phase (I normally hate calling /anything/ a ""phase"", but who knows...) Any advice for me to know? Anything at all? Right now what I'm thinking is genderfluid... Maybe even agender? egh. I don't know. Are labels even necessary? I would feel better knowing what I ""am"", though...

2015-07-12 06:57:21,3czrjh,34,19,"I posted here a little while ago about telling my gf and all that came with that. Don't remember? That's okay, clean slate for me.

In short, I've been struggling with my gender identity for maybe 2 years now, though I've had vague feelings before I had the vocabulary to describe it. Now I'm going to say I identify as genderfluid and leave it at that unless there are more questions.

Anyway, I told my girlfriend about this, and she has felt a whole sort of emotions: confused, accepting, uncomfortable, scared. We've been together for almost a year now, and then, when I asked her, she told me that once the semester started, she'd help me do make-up and clothes and things, and I thought it'd be great. Fast forward to now, semester is 2-ish months away, and that doesn't seem like it's going to happen.

I was really, really afraid to come out to her. It's been really tough to tell myself that I'm not ""normal,"" let alone reveal it to someone else. What happened today was I approached her about her frequenting /r/TumblrInAction. The first time I brought it up, and how the community on there made me feel uncomfortable and invalid, she went to their defense, and then telling me it doesn't matter, and then telling me that she deals with racists and misogynists, and she doesn't let them get to her. And today, after a post on the front page, specifically invalidating genderfluidity pops up, making me feel even more like shit, I bring it up to her and she tells me to grow thicker skin. And when I told her that her frequenting it was what made me feel like I couldn't come out to her, she told me to ""grow the fuck up.""

So, I told her I don't trust her to talk about this with. And it sucks.

I don't have anyone at college that I think I could bring this up with, let alone friends from hs. I think next semester I'll check out the LGBT support on campus, but that's, again, months away. And my feelings about this have been really strong, lately, so having no one to talk to is bringing back self-destructive tendencies and self-invalidation, and I really don't want it to. 

TL;DR: Came out to my girlfriend even though I was afraid she'd be transphobic. Right now, I feel like that was a mistake, and now I have no one to talk to.

UPDATE: So now, I wrote a letter thanks to some suggestions, and sent her it. We discussed the points of how I feel and what I need from a relationship. She was wary and said it was weird, at first, but now says she'll support me. Of course, this support is coming from her missing me for a few months, so I'm still wary. She even responded to me asking her if she supports me in this with ""If I'm not will we break up?"" So, I don't really know what to make of it.

I managed until today to wear my bikini but now I'm majorly depressed and feeling horrible in my body...

I don't have binders with me, so I don't see how to cope with body dysphoria except for wearing baggy clothes to hide my curves, but it just not possible with this heat...

2015-07-16 16:06:45,3dinq0,13,31,"This is a ridiculous wall of text, but I feel better for writing it and don't know how to clean it up. If you can make it through it, I could really use some thoughts, advice, or vaguely supportive sentiment.

So, I'm pretty sure I'm agender or neutral/neutrois (faab), but I am feeling very confused about it and don't believe that gender has any significant biological basis (I am aware of the studies that show differences in brains, but brains are plastic as all hell and those differences will look the same either way), and am a bit worried I might just be adopting the label for convenience. And since I started questioning my gender some things (being called by female-gendered words, having boobs) have started to bother me a lot more than I used to (is this normal?), and other things I remember from my past make more sense from this perspective

Arguments in favor of my being agender:

1) I have never thought of boobs as anything other than inconvenient and annoying, have often wished them smaller, and have never used anything other than compression sports bras, and I am recently outright hating them and planning on binding them. 

2) I want to be muscular and have fewer curves, and I think I'd rather my voice were deeper. 

3) I've always worn men's clothing almost exclusively, although I cannot remember if that was originally my choice or a parent's choice that then became habit (it definitely remains my strong preference though). 

4) I've hated and actively avoided my reflection for years, thinking that my face doesn't look like me and shouldn't be that round or soft looking, since way before I started really questioning my gender. Although maybe I just need to loose weight.

5) But I don't want to be hairy or have a beard, I don't want a penis (either set of genitalia works for me, I think), and I don't want to be large or wide-set or otherwise super manly looking. If I woke up as a man tomorrow, assuming that everyone accepted that I had always been that way and there was no social issues as a result, I think I'd be happy about it if I were slender, not super hairy, and generally more on the relatively feminine looking side, but if I were extra wide-shouldered, heavy-set, hairy, or macho looking I'd probably feel as wrong as I do now, if not more so.

6) Lately, I don't like being called ma'am or pet names or sister or girl, and I enjoy it when I am mistaken (usually briefly but fairly often) for a man or am called ""sir"". I'm not sure if my enjoyment of that is because of being taken for something other than female for once or if I tend towards the masculine end of agender or what. 

7) Also, I prefer, although I have often been ashamed of the fact and tried to deny it to myself since I assumed it just meant I had an internalized sexism problem (maybe it does mean that, I don't know anything anymore), male characters in games and other media, and when I dream I am often a man, though not always myself, in those dreams.

8) I roomed with a whole bunch of very gender-conforming women and neighbors a while back, and I actually independently thought, to paraphrase, ""I'm not one of these people, but I'm not a man. I wonder if agender is a thing,"" and typed that word into the subreddit search and found you and so discovered that it is a thing. Point being I independently made up the word 'agender' as a possible descriptor for myself, before I knew anyone else called themselves that or about other varieties of genderqueer. And as soon as I found out that it was an actual thing I felt enormously relieved.

But for all that, I'm confused as hell. I genuinely believe that almost all of the differences between the genders are social in nature. So for most of my life I've just assumed I'm an unusually manly, non-gender conforming woman, and in retrospect there have been many times when I've suppressed or tried to 'overcome"" things like wishing that my voice was lower. And I used to think (not anymore, please don't kill me :(    ) that transgender people, though they had every right to do as they please and are equal human beings in all ways, were basically just people who were like me but who thought that gender roles were biologically based, and I thought they were just reinforcing gender stereotypes by declaring themselves to be men if they liked manly things or women if they liked womanly things, etc (in retrospect, stupid. I'm sorry). 

I am only getting more sure that I am not a woman as time passes (it's been 1-2 years since I started actually questioning it), but I still have this doubt that I might just be thinking that for convenience's sake. If I think of myself as gender neutral, I feel like peoples' sweeping statements about how women are this or men are that feel less personal and infuriating. I don't have to worry about looking traditionally hot or beautiful. I don't have to feel uncomfortable around both women and men because I'm not womanly enough. It makes me feel free and unencumbered. For most of my life I've been very angry at all the gender roles and stereotypes that tell me what I ""should"" be but am not and don't want to be, and if I'm not even female at all and those ""rules"" don't even apply to me then I don't have to be so angry anymore (though not completely, since I do still believe those roles and stereotypes are baloney). Thinking of myself as agender soothes a bunch of my problems, so how am I to tell that it is an actual thing that I am and not just a way of getting out of those problems?

I don't know if any of that makes any sense. I'm just tying myself in knots about everything to the point that I'm only getting more and more confused. Everyone who made it through the wall of text gets an imaginary but delicious cookie. Thank you for even reading this.

2015-07-17 12:04:40,3dm7br,2,29,"Short explanation before I start: Two of my friends (both trans men) live in a city in the south of my province that has a big transgender and non-binary network, as well as a health system specifically for these people (specialised clinics, doctors specialised in trans issues, etc.). It's been an immense help for both of them ever since they moved there. When I ran into them last month after my psychologist appointment (his office is in the same city) and told them about my gender issues, both suggested that I tag along for a meeting sometime. When one of the two texted me on Tuesday afternoon ""We're having a trans-only meetup tomorrow, would you like to come?"", needless to say I went. :p


The group was a bit small this week (10 people, I believe), but that's because not everyone shows up every week. The first thing the group leader (a really awesome trans woman) said to me was ""you have the most fucking rad hair I've ever seen!"" It made me laugh :D It was really freeing to be there, though. It was my first time properly ""out"" as Sascha, and it was my first time meeting other trans people face-to-face other than my friends. Being called by the right name and pronouns was both refreshing and comforting, and being surrounded by people like me made me realise that what I go through is a lot like what they all go through. The group was mostly binary trans people this week, though there was another non-binary person there too, and they seem to be pretty nice. The group leader was happy to see another non-binary person show up and really appreciated hearing my point of view on everything we discussed.

Being called by the right name and pronouns was both refreshing and comforting, and being surrounded by people like me made me realise that what I go through is a lot like what they all go through. The group was mostly binary trans people this week, though there was another non-binary person there too, and they seem to be pretty nice.

So quick background, 19, Maab, living at home. Back in like April I figured out I was genderqueer, it felt nice to have a broad label I could use to explore and express the non masculine parts of myself. I started regularly painting my nails, I stole/borrowed an old makeup kit of my mother's and have messed around with that when I go out on my own, I changed my online profiles to say they/them. I've only come out to one friend but a few people noticed the profile changes and everything's been mostly positive.

So in this process of figuring myself out I naturally considered one extreme, what if I'm trans? For some reason I can't get over this idea for a handfull of reasons. I don't in any way feel attached to being male, other than the obvious social ease. If I could choose a sex at birth I would choose female no doubt in my mind. I tried cross dressing when my family was out of town and I had the house to myself, just the sight of myself as a woman made me giddy.

I dunno though, I have my doubts. I don't think I've ever experienced a strong dysphoria about my body.

When we started dating, I was a totally different person. I don't know if I was straight even then, but for religious reasons I didn't even consider anything else as a possibility. Now, I'm an adult with different feelings, less raging hormones, and no religious barricades on the way I view sex. I completely reject the notion of binary gender, and I don't feel like sexuality is a black and white issue.
Already being in a relationship when my views on sexuality and gender changed makes it kind of difficult to figure out how I really feel. In no way do I want to be with anyone else, I just kind of want to talk about it and figure out who I really am. For starters, the reason I think I am better described as pan than bi is because I don't care about gender at all. I don't care about genitals, identity, etc. of my current (or hypothetical) partner. Even my sexual attraction to people is not an attraction to their body, but to who they are as a person. When I am in a relationship, the reason I want to have sex is not to satisfy a physical urge, but the desire to bond emotionally with the person I have feelings for.
It's really frustrating to try and explain this to people. A lot just don't understand that pansexuality exists. If I try to explain it, people will say I'm just bisexual and need to be a special snowflake, and talk about identifying as some made up, inanimate object gender.

2015-07-23 11:22:27,3eb7wr,13,12,"Hi everybody--MAAB here, currently coming to terms with something I've experienced pretty much my whole life without having the words for it: gender dysphoria. I've begun identifying as genderqueer because that label comes closest to describing the way I feel about my gender, and I've started trying to externalize that identity by making my wardrobe a little more androgynous, which mostly feels good.

The problem is that I'm a teacher. I work with teenagers. I don't have much desire to bring this androgynous look into work, but I've been living with a pretty constant fear of being ""caught"" dressed more androgynously outside of work by a student, students' parent, etc. I know there's nothing shameful or weird about wanting to dress the way I want to dress, but I think for a lot of people--especially younger people in the pretty conservative town where I work--a man dressing in, or shopping for, women's clothes comes off as really creepy or even perverted. And even if it doesn't, the fact that I don't present that way at school makes it seem like something shameful and secretive.

I'm sure a lot of people have to deal with situations similar to this, where they have to present one way at work and other ways in other parts of their lives, but it feels especially difficult when the people I work with are teenagers, and the success of my work in the classroom has a lot to do with their respect for me...something I feel like I'll lose if they see me ""out.""

2015-07-24 09:41:57,3effcf,10,3,"So, I'm new to this. Well.. not really new. Up until recently, I identified as transgender, and I had since I came out to my parents in 1996. I know some of you weren't even born then (heck, some of my doctors haven't been in practice that long!) I'm in my early 40's now.

Recently I pulled back the veil on a secret I'd been keeping from myself, the fact that I don't *really* feel any drive to be, or maintain, a feminine presentation, and truth be told, I've only pursued a feminine identity because I really loathed the masculine one put on me. But like I said, 1996. The whole concept of non-binary genders only existed in Science Fiction.

Anyways, after 19 years in 'lost in transition', I'm realizing that ""Trans Woman"" is only roughly half right.. and that really ""I"" fall into a strange grey area between the genders that's hard for me to fully describe.

Conveniently I'm still pre-op in all of this, so thankfully I've had time to really come to grips with this stuff BEFORE making any changes I might regret. In terms of what I'm 'after' in terms of medical transition...well, not meaning to be appropriative, yet I feel like the term ""Intersex"" is a lot closer to my target sex. I don't mean hermaphroditic, with genitals of both.. nor am I seeking an absence of genitalia. Rather what I guess my ideal would be is inbetween, or ambiguous genitalia.

I'm struggling to find language for all of this, so please be patient as I step on everyone's toes here. I'm trying not to.

I've poked around the internet a lot trying to find some words for where I fit, or words that fit me, but the words I'm finding, are kind of like me trying on hats.. the only things that fit, don't look good, and the things that look good, don't fit.

I'm not ""**Genderfluid**"". This identity or presentation really doesn't change at all.

""**DualGender**"" is a similarly ill fit (**Pangender**, **Bigender**, etc). I'm not both, I'm between.

""**TransMasculine**/**Feminine**"" doesn't fit. I'm not really either.

""**Genderqueer**"" is an ill fit, I don't have the ""in your face"" gene, and I'm not really interested in 'challenging people's notions about gender' per se.

""**Nonbinary**"" is really more of a catchall term. It doesn't identify me.

""**Androgynous**"" is a fair fit, but it's only a presentation term, and doesn't speak to the gender identity issues. ""**Androgyne**"" feels weird to say, and my mind can't decide how it wants to pronounce it.

""**Agender**"" and ""**Neutrois**"" are both kind of an issue, because I don't feel specifically that I have 'no gender'.. just that the gender I have is.. 

* ☐ Male
* ☐ Female
* ☐ Both
* ☐ None
* ☒ Other.. please describe: ___________________

...if that makes sense. 

""**Intergender**"" feels right from a linguistic standpoint, but from what I can tell, there's some disagreement about whether Born-Dyadic individuals should use that term, and I don't want to be considered appropriative of intersex issues and labels. Even if I can get genital reconstruction to my tastes.. it won't change the fact that I was born Dyadic.

I don't like something about ""**M-t-I**"" (""**Male-to-Intersex**""). part of it is just the **M** being there (gross).. but again I don't want to run too far afoul of intersex folks' sensibilities. I know that appropriation is a hot-button issue for many intersex people. I don't want to co-opt their terminology, but I'll certainly support their struggles. But I'm just trying to be me.

And so on.

The words I'm finding seem to have so many variations for ""people with both genders"" or for ""people who flip back and forth"" or people who ""mix and match""... and a few for ""no gender at all"". But when it comes to people stuck in 'no man or woman's land'.. I'm having trouble finding a word that doesn't sound super weird, or isn't going to get me into some pointless internet fight.

Rather what I guess my ideal would be is inbetween, or ambiguous genitalia.\n\nI\'m struggling to find language for all of this, so please be patient as I step on everyone\'s toes here. I\'m trying not to.\n\nI\'ve poked around the internet a lot trying to find some words for where I fit, or words that fit me, but the words I\'m finding, are kind of like me trying on hats.. the only things that fit, don\'t look good, and the things that look good, don\'t fit.\n\nI\'m not ""**Genderfluid**"". This identity or presentation really doesn\'t change at all.\n\n""**DualGender**"" is a similarly ill fit (**Pangender**, **Bigender**, etc). I\'m not both, I\'m between.\n\n""**TransMasculine**/**Feminine**"" doesn\'t fit. I\'m not really either.\n\n""**Genderqueer**"" is an ill fit, I don\'t have the ""in your face"" gene, and I\'m not really interested in \'challenging people\'s notions about gender\' per se.\n\n""**Nonbinary**"" is really more of a catchall term. It doesn\'t identify me.\n\n""**Androgynous**"" is a fair fit, but it\'s only a presentation term, and doesn\'t speak to the gender identity issues. ""**Androgyne**"" feels weird to say, and my mind can\'t decide how it wants to pronounce it.\n\n""**Agender**"" and ""**Neutrois**"" are both kind of an issue, because I don\'t feel specifically that I have \'no gender\'.. just that the gender I have is.. \n\n* ☐ Male\n* ☐ Female\n* ☐ Both\n* ☐ None\n* ☒ Other.. please describe: ___________________\n\n...if that makes sense. \n\n""**Intergender**"" feels right from a linguistic standpoint, but from what I can tell, there\'s some disagreement about whether Born-Dyadic individuals should use that term, and I don\'t want to be considered appropriative of intersex issues and labels. Even if I can get genital reconstruction to my tastes.. it won\'t change the fact that I was born Dyadic.\n\nI don\'t like something about ""**M-t-I**"" (""**Male-to-Intersex**""). part of it is just the **M** being there (gross).. but again I don\'t want to run too far afoul of intersex folks\' sensibilities. I know that appropriation is a hot-button issue for many intersex people. I don\'t want to co-opt their terminology, but I\'ll certainly support their struggles. But I\'m just trying to be me.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThe words I\'m finding seem to have so many variations for ""people with both genders"" or for ""people who flip back and forth"" or people who ""mix and match""... and a few for ""no gender at all"". But when it comes to people stuck in \'no man or woman\'s land\'.. I\'m having trouble finding a word that doesn\'t sound super weird, or isn\'t going to get me into some pointless internet fight.\n\n---\n\n***TL;DR:*** Is there a word for someone \'inbetween\' like me? Someone in the grey area of inbetween, but who wants to have erogenous organs to match?\n\nAny thoughts or discussion is very welcome.

2015-07-24 19:08:46,3eh7xf,8,16,"Hi.

I'm new to reddit. I've never actually used this site before (the horror stories of trolling has kept me away until now). I hope I'm not breaking etiquette by writing here. 

I'm 30. I have never really questioned my gender before but I have always felt different from who everyone tells me I ought to be. I don't have very many people to talk to about this and I don't have any genderqueer friends. I have lived in a very... whitewashed community all my life. By that I mean, almost everyone I know is white, cishet, english speaking. While many are accepting of other ways of life, no one I know really knows what it means to question the fundamental ingredients that makes a person identity. 

I have always known that I am bisexual. My sexuality is probably the one thing that I am most certain of. It's my gender identity that makes me confused. I don't feel like a woman. I don't feel like a man. I don't care about clothes that reflect my gender, I don't care about make-up, I don't care about what pronouns are used towards me. I'm neither femme nor masculine. I feel like there is no one out there who can identify with who I really am. I call myself a woman but I feel like a sham. I have this idea in my head of what a woman ought to be and I'm not it.

I had surgery a few years ago- breast reduction. I asked the doctor to take as much as he could off of me. I didn't want breasts. I don't want them now and I hate them. And last year, I was having severe gynecological issues and options were presented to me after ten months of dealing with nonstop bleeding and pain. So I asked the doctor for a hysterectomy instead of the other options- ablation, IUD, etc. When I look back at this, it looks like I'm trying to erase my gender. That thought scares me but at the same time, sort of confirms that I don't feel right about myself.

 I wish I could just say who I am and find others like me. Others who feel the same disconnect. After reading this, what do you think?

2015-07-30 05:06:09,3f4ing,3,4,"Hi everyone, 

Thanks for reading. I'm sexually female, and I've always identified comfortably with the female gender. I really try hard to acknowledge and stand up for those who are gender queer--I can't imagine what it's like to have to wade through the ignorance that is this gender binary system. I truly admire those of you who are strong enough to stand up to it. 
Yesterday I was at the grocery store. The person checking my groceries appeared to me to be gender queer and they had an androgynous name on their name tag. As they were bagging my groceries, they asked about my shirt, which had a logo of some men wrestling on it. It had the name of a high school above the logo. They asked if I wrestled, and I said that no, I had gotten the shirt from a thrift store. They said that they had done wrestling in high school, and I responded ""oh that's so cool! Did you have to wrestle in the guys' league?"" Immediately I felt weird about what I had said. My subconscious had assumed that this person identified as female, and I really didn't want to make the person uncomfortable or reinforce the binary with what I had said. They responded that yes, the wrestling team had been co-ed so they'd had to wrestle with guys. 
I fumbled with my change and didn't say much after that but when I got to my car I just couldn't stop thinking about it. I didn't want to be another ignorant person that the checker had had to deal with that day. So I went back, got back in their line and apologized for making that assumption. They brushed it off and then I introduced myself so it would be less weird, but I felt bad about bringing it up while they were at work (especially because another customer came up behind me as I was apologizing.) I really hope I didn't embarrass them. Did I make too big a deal of this? I really just want to be aware and conscious of how I treat gender in my life.
