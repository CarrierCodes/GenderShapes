2015-04-02 20:57:53,318h8k,0,1,"Hi. I posted this on /r/nonbinary and someone said that I should post it here too. 

I think I'm non-binary, and probably agender, but I don't know if I should tell anyone. 

The pro would be: I dislike people referring to me as a man and even just thinking of me as a man, which everyone does now. I don't know why, it's just uncomfortable. So if I told people, then they would hopefully stop and I would feel a little better sometimes. 

There are a bunch of cons though: I don't have any pronoun preference so for the most part I currently don't have a problem with how people talk about me (unless they specify the gender they assume I am). Also since I wouldn't be asking people to change pronouns they might think me telling them is pointless and be annoyed or confused and forget to stop thinking of me as a man. Also no one in real life will understand it like everyone here does and I'll have to explain it and many people just might be like ""So what?"". And I'm really unconfident so when they question its validity I probably will too and make myself seem ridiculous and I'll end up just telling them to forget I said anything. Also I'm not even totally sure that I'm non-binary and I don't think I ever will be sure. It's difficult for me to grasp my own gender. I'm only like 50% sure I'm non-binary and 50% questioning. Also I don't ""look"" typically non-binary, which of course doesn't mean anything, but you know people.

Does anyone maybe have any advice? Thank you all so much.

I'm 20, dfab and have been identifying as genderqueer/demiboy for about 2 years now. My gender is kind of a weird thing, I get dysphoria pretty bad, and I can definitely best describe it as ""I should have been born male, but I'd still be genderqueer."" 

Because of this transmasculine thing, I've really seriously looked into hormones and legally changing my name to the one I've been using for the past couple of months. (It's Rhys,pronounced ""Reese"", which I like for a few reasons.)

The only thing with actually transitioning is that I'd only be interested in partially transitioning, that is, I don't want any physical surgery. I don't mind my binder, and I actually really enjoy my body, even on some of my more masculine days. As much as a penis sounds nice, It's not what I'm most dysphoric about. 

I've done some research into HRT and I know I'd like a lot of the changes. I also know some of the changes are reversible if you stop. I'd like my voice to be deeper, and my periods to stop. I wouldn't mind facial hair, since that can be shaved or not. 

I also wouldn't mind a more male body, but I still like my breasts and hips sometimes, which is where all the questions come in.  

Can you actually partially transition that way? By starting HRT and stopping after a while so that the irreversible changes are there, but the rest goes back to normal? I know it says facial hair growth is irreversible, so would it just keep growing and have to shave it if you stop taking T? Has anyone else done a partial transition this way or am I crazy for considering it? I know my periods would come back if I stop hormones, so would there be any other ways of stopping it for good? Are hormones even my best bet for this or should I look into something else?  I've also been told that working out would definitely tone me up and make me look more masculine, I'm naturally pretty short and scrawny. So could I just keep up a somewhat masculine body type that way after lowering my voice and such?

My gender is super complicated and it makes all of this super frustrating. I'd just rather be seen as male/androgynous rather than female/androgynous, but still have my feminine body when I want it. Maybe I'm just being crazy. Also, I am out to my mom and sister, but no one else in my family yet.

2015-04-03 19:49:52,31cg8f,17,19,"Pretty much what it says on the tin. I'm totally cool with just using the term genderqueer but I kinda want to figure out more about what am I beyond just focusing on identifying beyond the gender binary. I just feel that genderqueer is too broad a term to fully define me.

 I'm biologically female but I really identify more male, I guess. But I don't feel like I'm a transman who wants to transition. I do sometimes feel dysphoria but I can usually make that ""go away"" by playing a video game or whatever with a character who I created as the ""perfect"" me. (Saints Row is perfect for this). Like if there was a pill that I could take and wake up with a penis and beard and flat chest the next day, that'd be awesome, but I also don't mind my female bio parts so if the pill wore off I would be fine with that. I'm kinda weird in the fact that I'm ""hoping"" for an excuse to lop off my breasts (like my mom has cysty breasts and that always leads to a cancer scare so if I develop that I've already sworn to just get rid of them so I don't have to go through that). But like 77% of the time I'm cool with them. So I don't really WANT to get rid of them, but if the opportunity comes, I will take it.

I tend to wear more masculine clothes, too. I've identified as a lesbian for years so I guess you could describe the way I dress as being ""butch"". 

I'm fine with having long hair and wearing make-up on occasion. It just feels weird. I feel like if I was presenting male 24/7 I'd still have the long hair because I love man buns so I find myself wearing that. It makes me feel sexy and confident. And I don't feel weird wearing make-up except when it's eyeliner and mascara...but that's just because it makes my eyes feel weird and I don't like it. Generally I only wear make-up when I have to ""look pretty"" at some sort of grown-uppy setting (like when I went to the career fair at my university or when I went to a VIP event for a guest speaker or a job interview).

I'd love to grow a beard but know that you have to go on HRT to do that and that seems a bit much. 

And as for pronouns...well I've been called feminine pronouns all my life so I don't mind them but IDK if I'd prefer male pronouns. I don't think I'd like to use the gender neutral of their/xir/etc because it just sounds odd to me when speaking and writing. Of course, I'll still use those pronouns for someone else if that is what they prefer, but it just isn't for me, I think. 

Also, where does my sexuality fall in with this? Am I a mannish type person? Does that still mean I'm a lesbian? Am I straight? IDK what to even think.

As for the one thing I have figured out: the name. Alex is unisex and I've always loved it because it can be short for either Alexander or Alexandra. I kinda but don't refer to myself as Alex. Like, I call myself my birthname on occasion but Alex is new so I sometimes I forget to refer to myself as Alex but at the same time, opportunities to refer to yourself as anything other than I are few and far between.

I\'m totally cool with just using the term genderqueer but I kinda want to figure out more about what am I beyond just focusing on identifying beyond the gender binary. I just feel that genderqueer is too broad a term to fully define me.\n\n I\'m biologically female but I really identify more male, I guess. But I don\'t feel like I\'m a transman who wants to transition. I do sometimes feel dysphoria but I can usually make that ""go away"" by playing a video game or whatever with a character who I created as the ""perfect"" me. (Saints Row is perfect for this). Like if there was a pill that I could take and wake up with a penis and beard and flat chest the next day, that\'d be awesome, but I also don\'t mind my female bio parts so if the pill wore off I would be fine with that. I\'m kinda weird in the fact that I\'m ""hoping"" for an excuse to lop off my breasts (like my mom has cysty breasts and that always leads to a cancer scare so if I develop that I\'ve already sworn to just get rid of them so I don\'t have to go through that). But like 77% of the time I\'m cool with them. So I don\'t really WANT to get rid of them, but if the opportunity comes, I will take it.\n\nI tend to wear more masculine clothes, too. I\'ve identified as a lesbian for years so I guess you could describe the way I dress as being ""butch"". \n\nI\'m fine with having long hair and wearing make-up on occasion. It just feels weird. I feel like if I was presenting male 24/7 I\'d still have the long hair because I love man buns so I find myself wearing that. It makes me feel sexy and confident. And I don\'t feel weird wearing make-up except when it\'s eyeliner and mascara...but that\'s just because it makes my eyes feel weird and I don\'t like it.

I seem to be, finally, (actually after a mushroom trip) finding myself and solidifying a style that actually feels like me.

 I identify as agender but find myself leaning towards a typically ""feminine"" presentation, usually with a more ""masculine"" cardigan. I really enjoy having boobs, but most of the time I like having them concealed with a sports bra.

 I kinda modded a lot of my clothed recently, cutting off the awful crew neckline and making something a bit more femme-andro. One problem, however, is that the only two sports bras I possess are really ugly, and you can see the straps now.

 I also bought a couple of tank tops to be worn under flannel. However, I want the ability to take the flannels off and still have a cohesive outfit underneath.

 So like all this text, for which I greatly apologize, has basically been leading up to the question: does anyone know of any bandeau style sports bras that would look nice under a tank top, are neutral in colour (black or beige), pretty but not frilly, and andro-esque?

It seems like there are a ton of ways to live as openly genderqueer but I'm trying to get a better sense of what some of those are. I have a lot of questions and some of them might be a bit personal, so you can pick and choose questions to answer or just answer all of them. Thank you for your responses in advance!

1. How do you identify / explain your identity to others?

2. How have you physically transitioned, or how do you plan to transition?

3. How do you present (male / female / androgynous / gender fluid / etc)? Is it closer to your assigned gender or the opposite gender (if this is a relevant question, I know it's usually frowned upon to ask this)? Do you ""pass"" or have different people read you as different genders, or do people always read you as only one gender?

4. What pronouns do you use? How strict are you with making sure people use them and how vital are they to easing dysphoria?

5. Do you use a unisex/gender-neutral name, or a male/female name, and did you pick it yourself? 

6. How soon after meeting someone do you explain your gender and ask them to use non-gendered terms and your preferred pronouns?

7. How do people generally react? What would you say the ratio of positive to negative responses is? What are some questions you usually receive? 

8. What is dating like? How do you use dating sites and such?

9. Did you or do you plan to legally change your gender / name? (sub-question: in your country, does an ""other"" gender option exist?)

10. When there's only a male/female option on forms or for bathrooms or whatnot and you're forced to choose, what do you generally pick? How uncomfortable does it make you to choose? 

11. How do doctors tend to react to you being nonbinary, particularly doctors that specialize in trans stuff? Does it throw them off? Or do you always seek out NB-friendly doctors?

12. Do you yourself have trouble thinking outside the binary and seeing people as neither male nor female? Or are you closer to being ""gender-blind,"" as I've seen it called?

13. How active are you within the LGBT+ community? How much acceptance or resistance to nonbinary identities have you found there (particularly from the trans part of the community)?

14. What labels do you apply to yourself? Do you call yourself trans or just nonbinary / genderqueer? What about terms that imply gender like heterosexual / homosexual / gay / lesbian?

15. Do you have dysphoria? If so, what types, if not, how did you discover your identity and decide to transition (ie become openly nonbinary)?

16. If you have kids, what do they call you? Like mom instead of mother, dad instead of father, what have you found as a gender-neutral alternative? 

17. How and when did you discover your identity, and how soon after did you come out?

18. What are the biggest troubles or inconveniences that you've ran into in not being binary? Do you have any fears or concerns in relation to your gender?

I was wondering what's the different, if any between agender and neutrosis/androgynous?

My worry is (admittedly slightly petty) that if I am actually neutrosis then people will judge me more because I'm more towards the girl end of the scale and I want to be feminine. I worry they'll do this because I'm male bodied and I feel it's less socially accepted for a male to cross the gender boundary than it is for a female. Can anyone console my worry?

2015-04-14 16:23:06,32ktfv,3,5,"Hey all.  I just want to get this out of my head: today I am dysphoric and none of my usual fixes are working.

I am somewhere in the demigirl-genderfuck-fluid-queer range and usually I am either comfy as neutral-fem or have an easily satisfied but strong inclination towards a particular gender set or aspects of gendered expression. It is like a persistent itch that I can scratch and usually, if I scratch the metaphorical itch fairly quickly and stop scratching if it fades, I feel really good. I do not typically consider myself to experience dysphoria in the sense of discomfort.

Today however, nothing is working. 

My day thus far: 
yay! it's sunny, 
&lt;hyper-fem mode activate&gt; let's dig out a sundress and maybe throw on some lipstick... 
&lt;brain switch flipped HARD&gt; NOPE.jpg let's put on khaki cargo shorts and a tshirt, 
&lt;still itchy&gt; apply binder and swap panties for boxers and junk, 
&lt;STILL itchy&gt; sat with it a bit to try to understand,
&lt;boy mode fading&gt; decided to try to force fem mentally, ended up changing into the dress but keeping boxers and junk.
&lt;blegh&gt; now I have scratched so hard I just feel uncomfortable in my skin.


In the past I've dressed androgyn or mixed and matched my presentation and that's been comfy but today I don't know what else to try.

Interestingly, I can usually use my self-perception of my face in the mirror to help figure out what I am feeling, but in each variant I felt I looked perfectly androgyn, 50/50 down the middle.

I am not sure if I am feeling agender right now or just some funky discomfort, nothing feels wrong per say, ie i am not dysphoric about any given body part or feature, but nothing feels empowering or 'right'. I am not finding that 'fuck yeah my outsides are AWESOME and totes match my insides' feeling. I know I am really lucky that I can very frequently achieve that, but it makes today worse as I have little/no practice in dealing with unresolved dysphoria.


Thanks for reading; hope you all have a good day.

I have some questions and a lot of confusion.

Lets start: I am a 19 year old pansexual male (curently sex wise) and I'm all confused about my gender and sex (or what I want it to be). I was hoping you the people of /r/genderqueer  might be able to help me.

Gender stuff: I don't really feel like any gender, just... Me. I don't know how to describe it. I'm not a boy, man, girl, or woman. Nor am I a tri-gender pyrofox. (Hehe) i am just a human who likes lots of behaviors about what society ascribes to the two ""normal"" genders and I take what I like from both. I am me, not any label that I know of can describe ""me"". Do you know what that is?

Sex: sometimes I imagine myself as a woman, sometimes a man, sometimes a FtM transperson, sometimes a MtF transperson, and sometimes any combo of genitalia and body shape (masculine or feminine I mean) when I am aroused. What I feel I am fluctuates depending on mood and what sexual situations I'm (imagining myself) in. I feel trapped as just a male but with any other body eventually I'd feel trapped eventually too (or so I think).

What am I? How can I feel comfortable with my body? Halp.

Can **you** help me out today? Please...

How can I **shift** to a more androgynous style? I am 21 years old. I was born in a male body. I dont feel like a boy inside though... 

I am going to a hair salon next week to get my hair dyed/highlighted. What should I dye/highlight my hair? Im also going to get a haircut. What haircut should I get? What are good androgynous choices... 

I want everything unisex and androgynous. I got the money and time and freedom. 

I am pretty slim/skinny. I am average height. White. Blue eyes. Lazy-eye. Long face. Natural brownish dirty blonde hair. Little of mild achne. Short-ish mid-length hair right now.

[Here are 12 recent photos of me that I just took today, with no filters. Maybe seeing me and what I look like right now, can help you give me advice/help/suggestions on getting a androgynous style!!!!'](http://imgur.com/a/gL3zS#0)

Please help as much as you can. I will be forever thankful. Feel free to write a huge comment or even comments telling your honest thought/tips/suggestions! :) I love long, very long helpful comments. 

Where could I shop online/in-person? What clothes should I get? What should I know about shopping for androgynous things......!??

What rings/bracelets/etc.. should I get???

What are some nice androgynous underwear? Are there even androgynous underwear.

Do you personally think I could personally pull off the androgynous look? I hope I dont look to boyish....... O_o

What should I know about androgynous style? Am I forgetting to ask anything?????????! 

How can I look 100% androgynous without surgery/hormones? :) Or atleast pretty androgynous. 

Please feel free to add anything else that you think I may want to know. 

:) &lt;3 :)

Hmmmmmm. My achne is slowly going away. My face used to be covered with achne, it is nearly gone!!! :) 

I may fix my lazy-eye someday. I got the money. I dont know though. Im starting to kinda like my lazy eye, I may just leave it. Im not worried about my eyes. They are big and blue and pretty I think. :D

I hate my current hair. Im excited to change it up next week. My hair texture is soft and wavey, I have my mom's hair.

I am 21 but I look younger than that. I look around 15-18 I think. I dont mind that. How can I play up my youthful looking body? That has to help me somehow. Maybe it will help me pull off a androgynous look..??? Lol.

I like indie old-fasioned old-soul hopeless-romantic type of fashion. How can I merge that with a androgynous look overall?

2015-04-25 08:11:24,33svzw,0,7,"Okay everyone I thought to write here after really coming to terms what I really am and what are the issues that have been bugging me for a long time. A lot of soul searching has been done. I would like to here your voices if the stuff I write makes any sense to you? 


I'm a 28 year old guy and I have idenfied as a guy for my whole life. But still I have felt for a really long time that I'm not really that typical man – this led me to doubt my gender and now here I will elaborate my thoughts and conlcusions. I maybe wouldn't go so far to say that I'm bigender. 


Best word I can come up with is being in between. Male but still...


Just look at ying and yang. I have both in me. 


What really clicked in my head recently was and interview of Tom Hardy, a really macho guy at least by his film roles and apperance. It makes so much sense to me. I feel like he just said something that makes me shout aloud ”bingo!”. There are others as well. And people who are just fine the way they look and with their bodies. Here's a quite from him: 


”In an interview with Now magazine, the former party-boy who has battled drink, drugs and crime to turn his life around, added: 'A lot of people say I seem masculine, but I don’t feel it. I feel intrinsically feminine. I’d love to be one of the boys but I always felt a bit on the outside.”


I wouldn't say I feel ”feminine” all the time. I feel that I'm a mixture of both – yet so aware of my feminine side that I can't claim I would be like ”other guys”.


Here's a chart I just created. The left corner indicates no dyshporia and the right corner dysphoria as its extreme form, maybe experienced by transsexual people.


Body dysphoria


|-x-------------------------|---------------------------------|
  
 

I'm totally okay with my body. No anxiety about body hair or beard or genitals. Or body shape. I've always like it and actually been thankful for it for being as beautiful as it is. But on some occasion I do shave my chest and down there...but never my legs. It is silly because when you shave and feel sexier but after few days I start missing the hair I already shaved! 


Social dysphoria


|-----------x---------------|---------------------------------|


I prefer male pronouns for myself and like my name given at birth. Having a female name would feel just not fitting...


I experience social dypshoria in the sense that in my heterosexual relationships I'm afraid to show my feminine traits especially in the bedroom. I prefer sex that is more diverse. The role thing with male aggression and female submissiviness doesn't feel righ. I like to play both roles myself as well. This also affects gay relationships because many gay men have a distaste for male feminity. Kind of in a passive role I like to play the feminine role and enjoy it. My best experience have been with women who were bisexuals as well. That's the ideal. 
I have experiented with crossdressing but full famale attire and makeup...doesn't feel that good. Although there is no denying that to dress in a androgyneous way makes me feel sexy. In public I wouldn't still like to do that. 


My social dysphoria also comes from my own ideals about what masculinity should be. I always have had really high standarts for myself. Now I am starting to feel that there is no one way of being masculine. It makes me feel relaxed. 


I have an insight that soul really does not have gender.

**I wanted to ask:**

- When did you realise that there was a term for how you connect to gender?
- How did you/how are you going about the mental and social transition into identifying yourself as nonbinary?
- Have you found people have made a big deal or has everybody been fine?
- Do you differentiate and/or make a point of stating the difference between your biological sex and gender? Why, why not?
- Have you or do you plan to take HRT for some effect or is recognising the difference within yourself enough for you personally?
- Which pronouns do you use for yourself and what are your feelings on the various gender-neutral ones?
- What do you feel about the terms 'girlfriend' and 'boyfriend', as well as 'groom' and 'bride', and 'husband' and 'wife'?

2015-04-25 18:29:31,33uc26,12,6,"I think I had some internalized bullshit (not phobia, but definitional) about the asterisk-usage trans\* and what it meant for trans day of visibility. I was fairly new to my recognition of being NB at the time (first post Feb 14, decide ""maybe I don't have a gender"" - aka I didn't have a word for me; 1 month ago I was like ""uhhh gfmgh GQ is just an umbrella what doing""), and I didn't feel like I should be involved, since I ""wasn't trans"" (my thinking at the time being that trans was FTM or MTF basically) and didn't want to appropriate anyone's spaces.

Now I'm beginning to wonder if NB is a kind of trans? Because... it's not cis. I keep dithering about changing my name to something gender-neutral (""but all my branding! my domain name!""), and I feel weird about the fact that I called myself mom's daughter last night (without thinking; I keep musing on the fact that *mom has two kids, and at least 1 son*, and that is how I mentally phrase it). I'm doing a lot of dwelling on this. I still haven't told mom. Hell, I still haven't shown mom the documentary I did on my depression. 

Maybe the reason I was conflicted about asterisk-usage trans\* is I actually did belong under that umbrella and I wasn't used to the idea, so I rejected the idea that that was okay? I know it's also fairly controversial in some quarters. So... maybe I am, kind of. I don't like thinking of myself as female. I would be happier without my boobs, and would absolutely not mind not having a uterus (my mind likes to dwell on the fact that my grandmother had breast cancer and mom had a hysterectomy, so it's plausible that I might eventually have a reason for them to get gone). I know boxers don't mean much in this regard, but they're comfy, and right now my favorite pair of pants is a men's pair of cargoish shorts. I would not mind magically having a dick, but don't have the balls to wear my packer in public even though it's kinda comfy/comforting (which is funny because it does have the balls). 

It doesn't hurt when people who don't know **ME** refer to me as a woman/miss/whatever, but it bothers me when I accidentally do (identity inertia is a thing, tho, and it's hard to overcome). I don't need to be a guy (and would probably prefer strangers read me as such?), but I don't want to be a woman (and would prefer not to be read that way). But... it's hard? And I'm non-assertive in strange environments and for fuck's sake I freaked out about having to order a sandwich at a restaurant I don't normally go to a few weeks ago. With mom there. :|

I was fairly new to my recognition of being NB at the time (first post Feb 14, decide ""maybe I don\'t have a gender"" - aka I didn\'t have a word for me; 1 month ago I was like ""uhhh gfmgh GQ is just an umbrella what doing""), and I didn\'t feel like I should be involved, since I ""wasn\'t trans"" (my thinking at the time being that trans was FTM or MTF basically) and didn\'t want to appropriate anyone\'s spaces.\n\nNow I\'m beginning to wonder if NB is a kind of trans? Because... it\'s not cis. I keep dithering about changing my name to something gender-neutral (""but all my branding! my domain name!""), and I feel weird about the fact that I called myself mom\'s daughter last night (without thinking; I keep musing on the fact that *mom has two kids, and at least 1 son*, and that is how I mentally phrase it). I\'m doing a lot of dwelling on this. I still haven\'t told mom. Hell, I still haven\'t shown mom the documentary I did on my depression. \n\nMaybe the reason I was conflicted about asterisk-usage trans\\* is I actually did belong under that umbrella and I wasn\'t used to the idea, so I rejected the idea that that was okay? I know it\'s also fairly controversial in some quarters. So... maybe I am, kind of. I don\'t like thinking of myself as female. I would be happier without my boobs, and would absolutely not mind not having a uterus (my mind likes to dwell on the fact that my grandmother had breast cancer and mom had a hysterectomy, so it\'s plausible that I might eventually have a reason for them to get gone). I know boxers don\'t mean much in this regard, but they\'re comfy, and right now my favorite pair of pants is a men\'s pair of cargoish shorts. I would not mind magically having a dick, but don\'t have the balls to wear my packer in public even though it\'s kinda comfy/comforting (which is funny because it does have the balls). \n\nIt doesn\'t hurt when people who don\'t know **ME** refer to me as a woman/miss/whatever, but it bothers me when I accidentally do (identity inertia is a thing, tho, and it\'s hard to overcome). I don\'t need to be a guy (and would probably prefer strangers read me as such?), but I don\'t want to be a woman (and would prefer not to be read that way). But... it\'s hard?

2015-04-26 01:50:37,33vntf,8,5,"So, growing up (AFAB), I was not a typical girl as I didn't like wearing overtly feminine clothes (though I was VERY fond of wearing overalls with cars on them and a jacket with an airplane design...tbh, I don't recall them ever being referred to as ""boy clothing"" so I probably just liked how they looked).  I played with matchbox cars a lot, as well as stuffed animals; I played with Barbies to an extent, but had no interest in baby dolls (my mother thought this was a sign of abnormality and was yelled at for not being ""normal"" over this).  Through elementary school, I mostly dressed like a tomboy though there were some times where I wore girlier clothes to fit in with my friends or popular girls.  When I could pick my own clothes, I wore girls' versions of masculine clothes (it was the 90s so I wore cargo/carpenter pants and square t-shirts, fleece vests, bucket hats, skate shoes, etc.).  When I was in middle- and high school, I ""was gothic"" and wore a mix of clothes from the boys and girls sections and referred to myself as ""gender neutral"".  I also had a male persona I would sometimes adopt (I pretended to be him, it's not like I had MPD); I posed as him online on a message board and I suppose it made me pretty happy to interact with people as a(n albeit androgynous) boy.

I dressed more feminine in college, but I was super uncomfortable, awkward, and just trying to blend in.  Shit was going on in my life, shit bombs going off left and right, and I started drinking to deal with stuff and did so for about 4 years.  After college, I drifted back toward being more androgynous.  Having been sober for 2 months as of this week, I've realized I have to actually start *dealing with* stuff I feel.  I have to figure out *why* I feel uneasy and what I have to do to get over it, not just go ""LOL BOOZE MAGIC TIME MACHINE""

When I have to select on a form if I'm a Mr., Mrs., Miss, or Ms. I hesitate because I don't feel like any of those describe me.  If it's for something that doesn't matter, I call myself Rev. even if that is inaccurate (or is it? I'm an internet-ordained minister...)  Going back to school so I can go by Dr. is out of the question (j/k).

I feel more like a peer around men than around women.  When I presented myself more femininely (), I got frustrated because men went into well-meaning-though-pedantic chivalry-mode around me and acted awkward when all I wanted to do is be a peer.  Around women I feel more detached like an observer, but sometimes I get all ""Guuuuuuuurl! Muh bitchez!!!"" but I feel more like a really camp gay man than a honest-to-all-gods woman.

Physically, I feel more attractive for my masculine traits (broad shoulders/chest, muscle tone, prominent/angular facial features, etc.) than I am about my boobs and stuff.  Thankfully, I'm not super curvy, but I pretty much just ignore my boobs and hips.  They're not my favorite but they're attached to me anyway.  I got bangs/fringe in January and though it looked really good, it was too feminine for me to deal with looking at, and I'm impatiently growing them out so I can look like myself again.

Despite all that, I'm ok with my body and don't want to change it, but if by magic or something I could have a male body with average male height (I'm 5'4""), my family would act as though I were always their son/grandson/nephew, my job acted as though I was hired as a man, and my s/o turned gay and still felt the way he does now, I would probably do it though I'd probably still wear skinny jeans, and have long hair (I'm sort of gothic so this would probably not be outside the realm of gothic maleness).

However, I feel this is too difficult for my s/o to talk about.  We talked about it before, and he acted afraid I was going to get a sex change.  I've explained my male alter ego to him and he had some questions in the vein of ""Are you actively trying to become him?""/""Is that who you actually are?"" and I sense a bit of uneasiness in him.  Now he gives me side-eye of any discernibly masculine sartorial choices.  I bought some patent-pleather oxford shoes to wear to work and when I told him I thought they were sexy, he implied he didn't like them at all.  Maybe he would have hated them, regardless, but I haven't gotten these kinds of reactions to my appearance before I brought up gender...I probably did the equivalent of ""don't think about pink elephants"".

Does anyone have any (nice) thoughts? (No ad hominems please)

Any advice for me?

Please excuse any incorrect terminology, I am new to this.

Welcome to tonight's ramble and the usual 'Does anybody else ____?'

I still feel fairly new to expressing the full range of my gender and that has been great overall but a few times now I have found myself slipping into full dude-mode when I am not wanting to deal with being upset or some stressful situation that I can't do much about.
I don't want dude-mode to become dissociative or be just an escape from my normal life. I also feel a bit bad about this because I feel like I'm engaging the stereotype/expectation that men aren't emotional, which is shitty and stupid.

The obvious thing is to just not let myself dude-out when i'm upset but then idk if i'll be dysphoric or what.

Since, anything i do that's mildly feminine she's suspicious and on my case like a tonne of bricks. She'd say she's accepting but far from it. For example, sticking with this prohibition on femininity:

* I buy some new clothes, a short and a t-shirt with a floral pattern, she calls them gay and feminine, even before I buy them she asks if I like floral stuff in particular [because I feel I'm a girl]. Tbh I've not stopped asking her opinion on clothes I buy. 

* I'm getting changed and she just come swanning into my room and catches a glimse of my chest. She grabs my shirt living it to and upon seeing my bare chest, asks if I shaved it. What the fuck does it matter!? I say no, (I had) knowing that if I say yes she'll rant about me possibility wanting a sex change and to be a girl even though I've told her in don't. 

* I still cycling to focus on my exams but continue shaving my legs because I've grown used to it and continue to swim, she asks if I'm doing it because I want to be a girl. I'd previously told her I don't want to be a girl thus I'm clearly just shaving my legs because, as a *person* I prefer it. 

* I comment on a person on TV saying she has a lot of makeup on. My mum  says ""why you saying that!? So you wanna wear makeup?"" I say no, knowing that if I say yes she'll instantly assume I'm actually a transsexual, insist upon buying me some and assume I'm depressed if I then don't wear it because I've lost my 'coping strategy' for dysphoria which I've told her I get very little of and I actually am fond of my body. 

* she asks a periodic intervals, maybe every week, if I'm still having ""those feeling"" and if I've had anymore thoughts about my gender and if I still don't want a sex change. It seems all she cares about is preventing me at all cost from getting a sex change even though I never will. She then doesn't accept no as an answer. 

* she assumes I'm going to get a girlfriend as if she can read the future, she still calls me her ""little boy"" even though I've given her many resources of various forms that tell her explicitly - as well as telling her myself - that agender means I'm not a boy or a girl and thus she should infer from that that calling me boy is pissing off...let's not even start on pronouns, just no. 

* I say I want to grow my hair to be longer like that of [Dan Croll](http://hangout.altsounds.com/geek/gars/images/2/2dancroll.jpg) and she has a fucking hissy fit. ""Oh why do you want to grow your hair, is it because you want to be a girl!? Well, you can't! Your hair won't grow like that, it's the wrong type of hair!"" Bullshit! She's a fucking control freak birch.

Now idk about you but I'd say that's not a very accepting mother, would you? She moans that its all too much for her to take in and that my coming out letter - in which I said I was gender fluid and also included an overview of trans stuff including that some get surged and that I don't want that - was a big shock. That was a year ago. Since I've talked to her, given her general info on trans stuff and specific agender stuff in the form of articles, blogs, videos, diagrams. Honestly, I dint know what the fuck to do. She says when I no longer refuse to answer her silly self-centred question of ""do I still want a sex change again"" that I'm being rude and inconsiderate. Fucking inconsiderate! How about me!? She's far from accepting and even when I slap it in her face the information that she's not accepting just goes over her head. I hinges,h cannot wait until university in September but until then, please....help? She's just driving insane. My dad just stays out of it and seems not to want anything to do with it. :( I just wanna be myself and that doesn't involve too much: more feminine/indie clothing, makeup, longer hair, my neutral name and pronouns, shave legs and wax chest, is that too much to ask?
