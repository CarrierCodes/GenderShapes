Only I can tell you what my gender is, right? But what if I'm lying? What if I'm lying to myself? What if I just desperately want to feel like I'm part of something special and awesome (the genderqueer etc. community)? What if just hate my real gender so much that I now have a delusion that I'm not a man? This is what I've been feeling like recently. Gender, just like sexual orientation, is not a choice, right? Gender is who you are, and what you feel internally fits you. You don't choose it. But I feel like I might be trying to choose my gender. If I was honest about what gender I feel like, regardless of what I want to be, I would say that I feel no gender. I don't grasp the concept of feeling a gender. I certainly accept people who do feel a gender. But when I try to search in my mind/soul/whatever for a gender I see nothing. I don't really 'get' gender. Does this mean that I'm agender? I would love for that to be the case. But that's exactly my point. I want to be agender. I want to be anything but a man. When I think of myself as a man, I hate myself. I won't accept the male gender for myself. But what if I am just a man who hates that part of myself? What if my true gender is a man but I just wish it wasn't? Can I then choose to be not a man? Can I refuse to be a man?
I'm sorry for the ranting sort of. I'm just really confused and sad that I might be a man who just wants to be special. I hate it. I certainly hate the physical maleness of my body, but that's a different issue than gender. I wish I could choose, but I can't, right? How can I actually know? Do I have to be a man? Also the fact that being a cis man is the easiest and luckiest thing to be in our world makes me feel bad for rejecting that. Lots of people would love the privilege that I have, but I'm just trying to throw it away. 
Anyway I was just wondering if any of you lovely people could maybe provide some insight into this issue and maybe help me. Thank you so much. I'm really sorry if anything I said was offensive or if I seemed like I was trying to invalidate anyone else's gender. I'm not, I promise. I respect all of you.

2015-03-02 02:57:39,2xmnlb,3,12,"Hey, so, this may be a long post. 

I've never felt an association/identified with 'girl/woman/lady'.  When someone would call me that, I'd be surprised, and have to remind myself that that's what I was. I've never been feminine or girly in the slightest; I always preferred masculine hobbies/toys/clothes/etc. as a kid. I never wore dresses or skirts, or anything floral/pink. Also, my parents were always very gender neutral with my brother and I. If I wanted Lego (which I did), I'd get it. My brother and I would play together, and I'd never feel like I had to play with certain toys or wear certain clothes. I'm thankful to my parents for that. 

I don't wear makeup, very rarely do my nails, and have very short hair. I always wear [masculine attire](http://i.imgur.com/EVDreU0.jpg), and have been mistaken for a boy/man several times in my life. I've also been told I have an androgynous face. 

I think maybe one of the reasons I don't associate with being female/a woman, is because I've never been feminine. I've always been very tomboyish. All the things that 'women' are 'supposed to be', I'm not. 

Also, I'm asexual and don't want kids, so I really don't associate with my female body either. I don't mind it, but I don't feel connected to my genitals, either for sex or procreation, which might also contribute. 

I don't think I have a specific question, I just wanted to type this all out. It's my first time admitting any of this. 
I'd just like any opinions/resources/advice you can give. I'd also like to hear your story, what made you realise you weren't binary? 

I'd also like to thank you all for this sub, just briefly browsing your pictures has made me feel like I'm not so alone in thinking I might not actually be 'normal' in regards to gender.

I apologize in advance, this is more of a word-vomit for my benefit. I just need to get all my feelings out in words...

I found myself reading through r/genderqueer after a not-so-great conversation with my longterm girlfriend. I don't know how to explain to her that while I'm FAAB, I don't feel like I fit in as a woman. Or man. I ended up crying like a baby last night when she tried to understand me by asking questions about my feelings on my gender. The topic has come up on and off throughout our 4 year relationship, but I usually just end up brushing it under the carpet because I don't know how to explain it to her (a cis-woman). She's really worried about me, because it's obviously not getting any better.

Honestly, I feel lost. I like dressing as a man, I don't like my body's curves (luckily they're minimal), and I wish my voice were lower. BUT I wasn't one of those kids that knew from an early age that my body was wrong. I don't think I'm trans, but I wish there were a way to take a male body for a test drive. 

At the same time, I don't mind female pronouns, or my obviously feminine name. I avoid public bathrooms at all costs, because I'm afraid to use the men's room and I usually get the stink eye in the women's.

I guess in the end I'm just wondering if anyone else is/has felt this conflicted about themselves. And how do I explain my gender uncertainty to my girlfriend?

2015-03-02 19:25:26,2xp6lr,4,4,"**1) How to accept I'm agender?**

I recently (like 6 months ago) realised that I am agender. this may sound bad but I feel like I'm some weirdo and freak. I'm worried others will think the same and this I'm just attention seeking too.  How can I accept that this is me? It's still an odd feeling knowing I'm not a boy or girl. How can I live as agender and be happy with myself?

**2) Who else here is out and why did you decide to come out? Should I come out?**

I'm struggling to decide if I should come out. I'm amab agender and I dress masculinely and people view me as a cis guy which i'm perfectly fine about. I even don't mind he/him pronouns, I just wish people could know I'm not a boy. I worry if I come out that people will judge me :?

**3) How will I ever get a boyfriend or girlfriend if I'm out as agender?**

I'm off to university and I'm imagine (proably wrongly) that it'll be this utopia where I (or anyone for that matter) can live openly as anyone they want. However I'm worried that people will think I'm abnormal and not date me because I'm agender and take the approach of ""eww i'm not dating them, they're not even a boy or girl"" even though I look masculine as if I were any other cis guy

**4) Lightening up my parents**

I told my parents *ten whole months* ago that I'm genderqueer and they - particularity my mother - haven't quite accepted that I'm not uncannily anomalous and want a sex change. She even kept asking essentially if I'm still GQ, that is until I gave in and told her I'm not just to get her to shut up. How can I get her to stop freaking out if I tell her again that I'm agender?

I'll just jump right into this as to not waste your time

I'm a male and still in highschool and thus, still under my parent's care.

Now, they know about me being gay and whatnot (Mom is okaaay with it, dad is on the fence about it), my mom also knows that I'm striving for a more feminine body, but not wanting to transition or anything. My body shape is another story, but as the title suggests, I need some tips on what hair style to go for.

I have been growing out my hair so when I go to a stylist, they have more hair to mess with, but I still don't know what I should get. Personally, I would LOVE something like [this](http://imgur.com/a/FyEWJ) (Shortish hair and longer bangs, you get the idea) And yes I know they're models and mine might not be as perfect, but it's just to give you an idea. (Oh and my hair is  dark brown, I've thought about maybe coloring it/bleaching it)

But my parents (my dad especially) aren't the most accepting people in the world. My mother MIGHT be okay with it, but I doubt my dad would.

My questions are: 

1.) What hair should I go for as to avoid too much confrontation with my parents and others will still getting that girly hair I want?

2.)How can I find a stylist willing to do it? (I don't want to embarrass myself!) 

3.)Should I show them a picture of the hair I want? (I don't think I have the guts to show them a girl model) 

4.)A BIT off topic but, should I do my eyebrows? It'll look much better with the hair I want but I feel like people would pick on me at school (I don't really care what they have to say, but you have to admit, it is pretty annoying)

5.) Not really a question but ANY tips about this general topic would REALLY be appreciated!

So yeah... it needs to be kind of unisex but thrown more to the feminine side. I can also post pictures of my current hair/face if you would like. (The reason I didn't post this to a hair subreddit is because I feel like you people would understand more)

Sorry for the wall of text but that's the shortest I could keep it!

Also, if there's a better subreddit for this post PLEASE tell me!

Love you guys and have a great day! :)

How much function do you retain downstairs? I know that female hormones and AAs can really mess with your libido and cause some shrinkage. Have had that happen on AAs when I was on a higher dose. 

But I mean are you still capable, after feminizing to have good penetrative sex with your partner if you're feeling particularly masc?

There are days when I really love to dom someone (And penetrating someone is part of that experience for me, not sure how else to explain it) and even though I desire to be more femme in body I also don't want to lose a lot of masculine sexual function (this opinion might change for me once/if I start hormones). But I'd just like to see if I can get some info on what it might be like if I did. 

Any insight is appreciated. Feel free to PM me if you don't want to comment.

2015-03-11 00:43:09,2ymi83,23,28,"Alternate (maybe throwaway) account since I'm kind of well known...

I fucked up.  I fucked up hard.  I should have had top surgery instead of that first boob job.

Note: If I offend anyone with anything I say about gender, orientation, roles, etc, please chalk it up to ignorance.  I'm still working on figuring this stuff out.  

About me:  I'm a transmasculine individual, AFAB, still trying to figure out where I fall in terms of gender and how far I want to take myself in terms of transitioning.  Could be FtM.  Could be genderqueer.  Could be demiboy.  There's some fluidity there, but I pretty much always stay on the androgynous to masculine side.  Even in boy mode, I'm well aware that I'm pretty femme in presentation.  Think Visual Kei.  The point is, I've done something terrible to myself and feel completely trapped.

You see, as a female, I'm considered extremely attractive.  I'm a rather famous professional glamour model.  I did actively pursue this career for the financial benefits.  No one forced me into it.  I saw an opportunity and took it.  Who wouldn't, assured an income well into six figures a year?

I thought that would be enough.  A fat wallet, and (as I once remarked to a friend of mine, laughing bitterly all the while) all the men I could eat.  

Note, I'm pretty damned gay.  Let's just assume I'm solidly masculine for a minute.  I'm really really really gay.  To the point where straight cis guys have been freaked out by me and said I ""make them feel gay,"" even when nothing as overt as a strapon or roleplay is involved.  The people who are most into me long term are bi, non-binary, or (in a few cases) gay males.  I like men.  I like a great variety of them, as many cute ones as I can get my hands on, and I don't like them in a hetero way.  That's abundantly clear to me, and I can tell from responses that, to a degree, my partners are picking up what I'm throwing down.

And no, this is not simply a reaction to my career.  I lived as a man for a few years before I heavily pursued this job.  I would say the modeling career is more strange to who I truly am.  

I want to transition so much.  I'm hitting middle age, and while my career is showing no signs of slowing down yet, I'm abjectly miserable.  My entire life's work is predicated on being female.  But I am not female.  It's a lie I've been telling for far too many years.

The worst part is, I've had a lot of plastic surgery to enhance my female looks.  This was a calculated business move.  It's paid off very well, but in the mirror, I am the most hideous of monsters.  I used to be able to pass as male.  Now, with these breast implants?  Not a fucking chance.  Not even with the best of binders.  This augmented ass?  Yeah, well done.  Good luck with that.  The most clever men's suit in the world couldn't save me.  My face?  Don't get me started.  I'm very pleased with the aesthetic result, and it is fantastic surgical work, but this body is 100% at odds with who I am inside.  It looks worse now, than at the beginning of my life!  Worse still, because I asked for it, paid for it, suffered the procedures for it.

I feel like I'm suffocating.  I'm having a hard time working any more.  My residual income is fine, and I'm far from broke, but I am completely trapped by the persona I've created for myself.  What the hell can I do now?  What the hell will I do if I transition?  I could afford it, but what about afterwards?  Counselors don't get it.  Lovers don't get it.  Friends don't get it.  ""Oh, you're so and so.  The famous whatsit.""  Yeah, whatever.

I want to have my implants removed, my ass lipoed back off, cut my hair, move to a foreign country, and start all over, but that doesn't seem very practical, does it?

If anyone knows of a surgeon who has done top surgery after implants, (A cup breasts before very large implants) then that would be EXTREMELY useful info.  Other than that, I am not really sure what I'm asking for, other than the vouch that I'm not totally nuts.

I'm depressed.  I feel stuck.  I can't take it any more.  Not for any princely sum.  Kindness would be majorly appreciated.  Any ideas what to do next, so I don't freak the fuck out would also be appreciated.  I've got financial resources and an ok living situation.  The only thing that would be potentially difficult is escaping my own celebrity.

Thanks for listening.

I can relate to trans folks' stories. I'm biologically a male, dress as male (for the most part, with a few flairs on) and identify with both male and female personalities.

I've thought ""how would it be if I were a girl"" ever since I was 6. It was always there. I used to like ""girly"" cartoons, like Sailor Moon and Sakura Card Captors. I felt it was pretty normal, until I was told those were for girls, and I was a boy, so I shouldn't like that. I also used to be a crybaby and pretend I was a girl. My parents told me to ""man up"". 

At 10, I started paying attention to high heels. Enter 13-years old me. I realized I liked girls (and hated boys, ended up kissing my brother at 11, it was awful). There was this class where we hugged the classmates, and I always felt good hugging the girls, never the boys. I also started cross-dressing with my mom's clothes, until she found out at 18.

I remember the day pretty well. She came to me and asked ""were you wearing my dress??"". Later on, my dad came to me and said ""look, I can't arrange a girlfriend for you, you have to do it, we could go to a hooker"". After that, I didn't do it anymore, also because I think my mom's clothes are too ugly.

I took an interest in fashion, makeup and nails. I'm not embarassed to talk about this very much, but other people feel that way... I had a girlfriend, but all she had to say about it was ""you might have been a woman in your past life"" and ""you're the man here! Act like one!""

Now I'm an adult, and gave some more thought about it. I experimented with having female alter-egos, and that brought some more light into things. Right now, I don't feel the urge to be a woman like most transgenders do... it's more like another side of me that melded with my current self. I ended up taking the best of both worlds and walking on that fine line. Girls I talk to love me because I can speak their language and ""get"" their feelings.

If I could start everything from zero, I'd choose to be a woman. But I realized the path I am taking is much easier for men.

And no, I don't like guys at all. Being harassed by bullies sexually at 12 and 16 was horrible.

When I think about my gender I feel like there's a weight on my chest pushing hard. When I first accepted that I was gay, I felt really happy and that it fit me perfectly.

There are reasons that I could just be male, but there are also reasons that I could be something else. I've seen guys and wanted to look like them on wear what they're wearing, I don't want to get rid of my body and facial hair completely, I like puberty and when I first saw chest/armpit hair I was excited, before this I had a low self esteem and when I thought of my desired body it was always male. I I had the choice I would still chose to be born male. 

I remember looking at some guys not long before my questioning and thinking ""I want to look like that"" so it's confusing me.

_________________

I'm AFAB and identify mostly as a woman (socially), but I don't fit the (stereotypical) gender role of women perfectly so I feel like I don't fit the label ""woman"" perfectly.  Basically, even though I pretty much identify as a woman, I *also* think that gender roles are inherently limiting and kind of stupid because of that - if that makes any sense...  I also often wish I had a more androgynous body - or that I could easily switch between masculine, feminine, and androgynous looks and be gendered accordingly.

Could that mean that I am genderqueer?  Or am I just a confused, weird ciswoman and I shouldn't appropriate the term?


_________________

[As a background to my gender:  When I was young (maybe 7-13), I dressed like a tomboy, wore my brother's hand-me-down clothes, and often wished I were a boy (but not to a point of being miserable with myself or my own body).  In high school, I started to dress feminine out of social pressure and didn't mind it, but I was not super feminine.  Now, post-college, I dress both masculine and feminine.  I feel physically comfortable and cool in masculine clothes that fit me well, and I feel sometimes sexy but sometimes awkward in feminine clothes that fit me well.  

Socially, I am a lot more (stereotypically) feminine - I squee at baby animals, I relate better to women, I enjoy romantic comedies, I am empathetic and emotional, etc.  I'm not entirely stereotypically feminine, though:  I like video games, I like adrenaline sports, I am not interested in fashion or makeup, I can be very strong willed, etc..  But I'm definitely not (stereotypically) masculine either - like *at all* - I'm not athletic, I'm not aggressive or confident, Im not that into cars or sports or science, I have a very low libido, I am more socially anxious around men, etc.  

Physically, I'm really drawn to (both attracted to and wish I could better portray) androgyny.  I wish I had  both a female-bodied and a male-bodied version of myself that I could switch between whenever I wanted, and I wish that I was gendered as a woman in my female body and as a man in my male body.  More realistically, I think I'd like to be perceived in public as a guy sometimes, a woman sometimes, and an androgynous person who can't be gendered sometimes.  I don't have gender dysphoria that makes me miserable, but sometimes I wish I had a flat chest instead of breasts, sometimes I wish I had a slightly more androgynous face, and sometimes I wish I had no genitals... (I hate having a vagina not because it's a female part but because not being able to see what's going on in there terrifies me)].

^Does anyone else feel this way?

I'm not like some gender fluids that slip into starkly different mannerisms depending on their current gender. I'm just me most of the time, a petite, highly feminine person that passes pretty well as male, female, or androgynous. I think I spend the majority of my time male/masculine. I dream about it too.

Reading about gender fluid people who seem to move back and forth on the spectrum more heavily can make me feel invalidated.

I even get nervous just posting stuff on Reddit :S I am quiet in general and on days I present male, I don't want to be noticed in the slightest.

And last of all, I feel lonely. I don't know anyone in real life like me. The fact that I'm alone makes me question myself too. Like, ""No one else thinks like this, why in the world are you?""

Maybe gender fluid isn't the right label for me. I don't know. But I feel like if I do decide on a different label and try to take back the one I told people before, they'll judge me a lot. And they'll stop trusting me with what I label myself and just cast me off as some attention whore.

2015-03-17 23:52:42,2zet8m,1,1,"...two steps back is how the saying goes. Or you have today, where I feel more like I've been playing Dance Dance Revolution.

So, I spent a long, long time questioning my gender, and then I eventually came out as 'probably' genderfluid to a good friend last summer. That I did that still surprises me occasionally even now, but mostly, having someone I can lean on if I need to is something I do feel thankful for.

Anyway, part of my questioning was in the way that the whole feeling behind my gender would come and go, and my appalling attempt at having a normal adolescence. There's the whole gender and orientation not being a choice thing, but I couldn't and can't help but wonder if that doesn't mean they're fixed. I didn't do the usual teen thing of throwaway relationships, etc, so in that regard I still now have no idea what I'm doing. So I'm loathe to disregard that as a factor as much as anything else.

So when I was in the process of spilling my deepest secrets, I came to the conclusion that I was at a fork in the road. I had begun to start thinking that a relationship is something I might like - I'd never been too fussed before - the whole gender thing playing a non-exclusive part in that. This wouldn't really be for the sex (which gets into a story which will be for another time), but just the closeness with someone, which I've never truly had but have had something close enough that I'm pretty sure I know I want more of it. I couldn't help but contemplate that if I were to finally go down this road properly, the gender questioning would lessen (and there have been extended periods in the past when it just hasn't been an issue).

But I also reasoned that this whole gender thing wouldn't really just go away, given what I knew about the nature of gender &amp; orientation. So I talked about the idea of going down the gender exploration route. I've not gone to any real extreme, but I have taken small steps to blur the lines a tiny bit. I'm quite distinctively AMAB, but being part of the alternative scene has given me the opportunity to add a touch of makeup to an otherwise masculine appearance. I don't think I'll ever publicly go much further than that, but that I've reached a point that I feel able to do it is somewhat uplifting.

So the latter option was the easier, at it was reliant on just myself, rather than getting anyone else involved. The limit of my experience in the former goes as far as two occasions where it didn't even get off the ground, and as I need to be able to do more than just be friends with someone, therein lies a difficultly.

Anyway, long story short (ironic, given the length of this post), there is a girl from work who I've for a while been potentially interested in, but the idea of actually being interested in someone in this way is almost a completely alien concept. Anyway, she's mentioned that she doesn't have as much of a social life as she would like, and I used this as an opportunity to suggest we go out for a drink sometime. She liked this idea, so I can definitely move forward, but I obviously don't know yet if this will be just drinks with a colleague/friend, or if it can develop into something more. Either way, I will be out of my comfort zone in a way, but relaxed too, as we do seem to get along and chat really easily.

Anyway, to bring this all back around, I realised that this line of thought threw me around and off the track I thought I was on. While the whole genderfluid thing that I think I have identified does throw me onto some part of the female spectrum (although I don't at all come across as effeminate or camp), I'm also too strongly tied to the male part; however, I've never felt truly attached to maleness and masculinity. 

As I began to contemplate the idea of what could lead to what with situation I've described - something I'm predisposed to do with just about everything that happens in my life - I realised that exactly what I had been ponderous about back in the conversation with my friend in the summer was possibly going to happen (i.e. swing more strongly towards male than I would do otherwise). It wasn't just a case of being comfortable being male, but actually feeling and wanting to be more masculine - something that never, ever happens as I'm already more than masculine enough for even the days when I'm feeling my most male. And with everything that has happened in the last year, it kinda caught me by surprise (and hence the DDR comment at the top).

So it's another wall of text I've put here, and once again, I'm not really looking for any specific responses, if there are any to give.

It's hard to describe how I've always felt. Since 14, I've always thought ""why couldn't I be female? oh well"" and moved on with my life. It's never been a big deal to me just an annoyance. I've had a cross dressing/feminization fetish since that age as well(it doesn't help that I by no means have a feminine build.)

I'm happy with being a male, don't get me wrong. I like being masculine 75% of the time. The other 25% it feels wrong. I have no problem being male in day to day life. 

At the same time, I know that if I had a choice at birth (like a video game) I would have chosen female. At this point, I have the desire to ""own"" my given gender(mostly due to societal pressure).

2015-03-21 16:27:34,2ztexh,7,9,"So, I have been confused for a long time now. I guess many of you can relate.

If i have to label myself it likely becomes 'intersex masculine androgynous androphile'.

I am intersex, having a condition called 48xxyy, which is mostly chromosomal (hence invisible), save for some not quite typically male curves.
I am masculine, I have no desire to be female (no offence) and was assigned male at birth. I am more or less comfortable with male, or at least from a binary perspective it is the most comfortable option for me.
I am androgynous, as I do play with my appearance and mix what others consider typically masculine and feminine (though I look at things void of gender).
I am androphile, as I am attracted to men. If you assume me male you could call it gay too.

My face, if I shave properly, is perfectly in the middle of masculine and feminine. You just can't tell. Depending on my clothes my body leaves you confused too. These are just my chromosomes and genetics and have little to do with how I choose to present myself.

I've been trying to answer the question if my ambiguous gender identity stems from being intersex and having an appearance which could go either way. Or could it be from my rebellion against the world? Could it be because I am actually comfortable being male but not with what society expects a male to be? And also, could my attraction to men (which took me years to accept) have somehow caused me to not consider myself male in some twisted way and an attempt to find an acceptable state of being?

Of course none of you can answer these questions for me and that is not what I ask. I guess this is the first time I write it so explicitly and I had to get it out, but also I am wondering if there are people who can somehow relate to these questions and have walked, or are walking, a similar path.",genderqueer,How queer exactly?,1426980454.0,"{'created_utc': 1426955254, 'id': '2ztexh', 'num_comments': 7, 'score': 9, 'selftext': ""So, I have been confused for a long time now.

Or could it be from my rebellion against the world? Could it be because I am actually comfortable being male but not with what society expects a male to be? And also, could my attraction to men (which took me years to accept) have somehow caused me to not consider myself male in some twisted way and an attempt to find an acceptable state of being?\n\nOf course none of you can answer these questions for me and that is not what I ask. I guess this is the first time I write it so explicitly and I had to get it out, but also I am wondering if there are people who can somehow relate to these questions and have walked, or are walking, a similar path."", 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'How queer exactly?', 'created': 1426980454.0}"

2015-03-25 11:01:42,308nip,5,9,"It’s a rainy day in Rome. Partner’s at work, and I’m recovering from a weeklong cold. During my time alone I’ve been reflecting about my genderqueer identity. It isn’t that I feel illegitimate to refer to myself as GQ, but because I am AFAB and used female pronouns, it felt safer. It even felt like an okay fit, since my identity and expression leaned prominently in the feminine arena. But I love my female body. I’ve only experienced body dysphoria once, and I’m enjoying the process of exploring what and how I express my gender spectrum.

That being said, it feels like my *baseline* pronouns if you will have shifted. Thinking of myself as she/her suddenly made me really uncomfortable. And yet, being referred to as they/them just seems so new and scary. I’m testing the waters with neutral pronouns, but I’m still feeling shaken by the shift. 

I worry about the backlash of exploring different pronouns only to find it didn’t work out for me. But talking with my partner, I also learned to remind myself that, first and foremost, I refer to myself as “I” and “me”, and instead of searching to what to call myself, the better way to phrase it is “what part(s) of me do I want others to acknowledge when addressing me?”
 
Initially, I was feeling limited and unsure what to call myself. My gender identity is, as we say, Facebook official and public, so it felt unnerving to change the GQ pronouns from she/her to they/them. The only problem is that neither pronoun group seems to fit… kind of like when you have this word to describe something: you know it's there, it's in the back of your mind, on the tip of your tongue, but you can't place it. 

So yeah, that’s my Wednesday morning. I wasn’t looking for anything more than just calming the growing panic by writing about it on here while talking to my partner at work. But if you have a similar story to share or maybe some advice, I’d love to hear about it.

Part of me wants to go to like a man-man barbershop and ask them to cut my hair or something but mom might be freaked out even more about that. She was asking me if I was trans or something the last time I got it cut because of me not knowing what the lady meant when she said she was gonna use the clippers. I REALLY liked it like that. Mom did not. She said she'd be open to it, but she'd want to know. Mooom, I don't even know???

I also want (and have wanted for a couple months now) to make my hair blue. Light blue around the (shorter) sides and a darker navy on the top where it's longer. Mom bought the bleach and the lighter blue a while ago (she was okay with doing it for me, buying the supplies, etc.; I just haven't asked her to do it yet) and I bought a navy from the same line when I decided I wanted two-toned. I bought some blue eyeliner/eyeshadow and stuff today and I wanna play with that.

I'm not really comfortable with calling myself feminine. I like my binder (but need a non-full-tank one because of my previous discussion with Underworks about sizing and fitting the right size over my body) even though it sort of just monoboob squishes. I wear a hoodie over it. The one time I forgot to take it off immediately when I got home/wear my hoodie while still wearing it, mom was like ""what bra are you wearing? it's doing weird things"" (since it was monoboobing hard that moment) and I just told her it was a sports bra. I just find boobs inconvenient. If I could wake up tomorrow and not have them with no surgery or whatever, I'd do it. 

I also kind of want to try wearing a binder under some of my more traditionally feminine clothing. IDK. I don't go in for dresses or skirts often. Mostly I wear hoodie ('cause comfy, lazy, easy, and warm) and jeans or whatever.

     If you'll recall a conversation we had about a week ago, you'll remember that you 'taught' me that 'they' can only be used in its {fading, archaic} usage and that 'he' should be used when referring to a person of indeterminate gender.

http://gender.wikia.com/wiki/Transfeminine

interested in being able to ""pass"" as female (or at least come close enough) but some of the transitioning to being a trans woman is bothersome to me.

i guess i should just describe what i want and what i dont want, and maybe you guys can give me some tips on how to accomplish these things.

i do NOT want:

+ sterility or genital shrinkage / malfunction

+ UNSURE about boobs.

i do want:

+ better skin tone, tighter, smoother, smaller pores, women's skin basically

+ changing facial features to be feminine(already doing laser hair removal on face and going to start on my legs)

+ more feminine figure, wider hips

+ NO BODY HAIR

+ currently growing my hair out long.

pretty much out as a vague and generic ""trans"" to everyone, made a new facebook profile with my femme name.

however, the ""dysphoria"" for me isnt really there.  for me its mostly just an absence of how i feel when im being /me/ and feminine.  everything just feels so congruent and my emotional being lines up with the rest of me like it never has before.

people have told me i was beautiful and i didn't believe them, i thought i looked ugly.  one of my friends said ""wow, you really are a woman then.""

i dont really know what i want.  i just want to be able to be myself.  i dont mind having to go into ""boy mode"" for certain things, although it is a drag if i have to do it too much.  the prospect of ""full time"" is exciting and terrifying at the same time.  im trying to not over think this and kill my own vibe, i dont have to be making all these decisions, and i can change my mind.

im just getting comfortable with myself after years of denial

so that is why there are certain irreversible things that i am not willing to do.  i also do not trust surgery.  what can i do?

here are some pictures of me:

I feel a deep discontentment with my female body 95% of the time.

I think some aspects are quite amazing (like menstrual cycles and the potential to give birth!), but that doesn't detract from my general unease and disgust with femaleness to the degree that I feel pinned down by it (or trapped in it!).

I was born female. I am heterosexual. I don't know where I fit on the gender spectrum, but I have always been weary of the binary norms. Despite this, I am frustrated with myself for being uncomfortable with being female—something strictly biological. I think that I shouldn’t feel one way or another about it. It’s not some role forced onto me. It just is what it is. But I do not like my body, and it causes me great unease. 

When I look in the mirror, I can't accept what I see. I hate my hips and butt and breasts. My thighs just seem generally shapeless. Overall, I have a weaker composition than most men. I hate how ""soft"" I look. My facial features are soft as well and I am drawn to sharper, deeper features (otherwise more masculine ones). To be brutally honest, I am repulsed by what I see. I don’t think that generally speaking women are ugly or anything like that. I just don’t get why it’s in the mirror. 

I have had an obsession with men from a young age. I have always picked up on their privilege. To me, they seemed more free, more successful, funnier, braver, more outrageous, more lighthearted, and less complicated than women. I looked at men and I saw power and movement, joy and grounding. I looked at women and saw sacrifice, pain, accommodation and anxiety. Men just seemed like the half that had it figured out.

Obviously looking at that now, I realize there are so many things that have traditionally held women down and still do. I hate the expectation of some effervescent personality, of that need to feel accommodating, of acting stupid when you're not. Of women congregating over things like consumption and trends, instead of more enduring things. (Again, this is what's reflected in the media, but it's also experienced. I simply did not fit in with girls my age, nor do I feel I fit in with college-aged women today. I find their interactions surprisingly vapid, maybe even scripted, and dissatisfying.)

Does this make any sense? Is my disgust with gender norms bleeding into how I literally perceive the female figure? 

Is there someone out there who can help me piece this together? I would greatly appreciate input.

I have lived the majority of my 20+ years as a cis female who always felt a really ""off"" about gender, and who, as a child, experimented with gender fluidity (as least as much as my conservative parents would allow). 

As I read more and more in an attempt to better understand myself, I am realizing that I actually probably identify somewhere in the genderqueer/genderfluid/neutrois zone: some days I am male, some days I am female, but mostly I'm just a person-shaped creature who couldn't identify with either gender to save my life.

I actually really like myself, way more than I did when I was younger. And on my female-leaning days, I feel really gorgeous and amazing about how I present myself in public. HOWEVER, between those rare periods, the dysphoria is BAD. I try to be positive, but on my neutral days I feel so unstylish (my gender-neutral uniform is a men's polo and women's ""mom-jeans"", light makeup and no hair styling, not exactly eyecatching attire), and on my male days, it hurts to get out of bed because I know I will have to spend the rest of my day managing/hiding/trying to ignore curves I wish I didn't have.

Also, I should note that I have zero sense of style (see ""mom-jeans"" above), but at the same time I really, really crave a style that would be suitable for me, that I could manipulate slightly to control and increase/decrease the masculinity/femininity when needed, but ultimately which just generally says ""I am not trying to ascribe to either gender.""
