As a child, i felt confortable being a girl and never asked myself if i was a guy, i was just a happy girl after all. But things started to change when i was 11. I started acting like a guy, i would dress like one, and i hated girly names that people used to treat me as,but i ignored it. Some months ago i started questioning myself even more. I started wearing men clothes,when my chests started appearing i feel disgusted and too feminine, and usually i hide them the best i can with baggy clothes and i wont let anyone see them, even my mom, i started wanting to cut my hair short, wish i was higher, wish i had muscles etc. Since thos started i have been wondering if im trans and i end up labing myself different genders, wich confused me even more. Nowadays i just want to know if im cis or not, know if im trans or not.

However I really am feeling I need to tell her— and that’s the hard part. 

I feel she’d be accepting— although she did just the other day say she thought Trump is handling this Coronavirus thing well, and that has me nervous— but that doesn’t make me any less nervous. 

I am AMAB and am perfectly fine doing my every day male life, and I don’t intend on letting any of that change.

I also have really enjoyed the women’s clothes when I’ve put them on. I have no intention of ever going into public in women’s clothes, I just don’t want the attention and I would never be able to pass wearing them (5’10, 195lbs, broad shouldered man with a beard and a gut) but in the privacy of my own home, I’ve enjoyed them. I wouldn’t even wear them when she is home since I don’t want to make her uncomfortable. Mainly I’ve really enjoyed putting them on and using the faceapp to transform them into my girl self. 

All in all, I could get away with not telling her, however there’s always the chance she will notice things out of place and I may have to explain. Also I feel guilty doing this behind her back.

2020-07-07 04:01:17,hmnc75,16,1,"Hello, I've been contemplating posting on here for a while. There are however a few reasons why I've held back. For the longest time, I've assumed that whatever negative thoughts I have had, are just my way of trying to conform to the society around me. I grew up to listening to my mother talk about how society and social media is influencing kids to be gay and trans, so even though I'm born into a much more open and developed world, I have a very hard time understanding myself and lately it's caused a lot of problems for me mentally. 

For some background; I'm 22, cis female¿, I realised I was bisexual early on in life and have always had a thing for women. I've never come out to my parents, and don't intend to. However, ever since I've been thinking more and more about my gender identity I find it hard to imagine a life where I can remain in the closet or whatever.  
Now to the gender identity bit; I've never felt feminine in the strongest sense, however, I've never felt masculine either. The thing that bothers me though is: if my mother or anyone comments on my behaviour or how I'm dressed and they relate it to one of the genders it really upsets me: for instance ""You should shave your chin you're looking like a boy"" or if my boyfriend says ""you're my strong boy, you shouldn't cry"" 

Now the reason my boyfriend calls me a boy now and then is because, I've expressed in the past that it made me feel nice. But, the more I think about it, it doesn't. It's like, when I'm being associated with either of the genders I feel broken. I don't know what this means? I definitely have traits of both the genders, and I don't really know what that means either because it's not like men and women have 'traits' beyond our societal perceptions of gender roles. 

I've been really really mentally worked up over this since the lockdown began especially since I'm no longer being forced to wax or do things that I feel uncomfortable doing. 
I feel this growing urgency to ""figure myself out"" and quickly label myself. I feel like if i were to understand what or who I am, I'd be happier. But I've also actively always avoided being thrown into a specific label, because I've been afraid of getting it wrong. 

I thought it'd be a good idea to reach out to the community, and ask you what your opinion is. Even though I realise, nobody can put you under a label but you, I just really wish someone would tell me who I am, or how I want to be seen, because I don't understand it at all. 

The closest label I've come to associating myself with is ""nothing"" and I'm not sure that's a relevant gender identity.

Lastly, how do I ever feel better about this? will I have to open up to my friends? because it's obvious that being treated or perceived as a specific gender really takes a toll on my mental health, it makes me shut down and I'm starting to realise I've been a very silent kid my entire life just be virtue of feeling out of place, whether I was with men, or women. How do I get people who have known me for over a decade to understand that I'm not who they think I am. Especially since people think that they know you better than you know yourself.

Recently I've been doing research about gender, sex, and, sexuality. I have female-sex characteristics and identify as a woman who likes men.

My question is, what does non-binary mean really? It seems that anybody who you ask has their own definition of a variety of self-identifying labels such as genderqueer, non-binary, non conforming, etc. The idea that there is a spectrum of sexuality and that gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals identify as such is perfectly within my realm of reasoning.

However, if people say they are non-binary, I understand that as the idea that they don't feel like they fit within western gender roles and expectations. Maybe, this is a man who likes to wear dresses, use makeup, and have long hair\*\*. However, if that is the case why can't we expand the masculine gender role to include typically female associated characteristics instead of having a they / them pronoun?\*\*

It is clear that men expectations and roles such as 'be the provider' and unemotional are being changed with stay-at-home dads, for example, and therefore paving ways to understand masculinity that differs from strong-man archetypes.

I've already considered labels like agender, bigender, and genderfluid, but I'm still not 100% sure if any of these match and/or if I'm really just cis and thinking about it too much.

I'm afab, but have always had a hard time understanding exactly what gender means. Like, I know I’m female because that’s what my body parts tell me I am, but I don’t feel any sort of inherent and long-standing happiness, or anything really, towards being female (or any gender). I do have little moments of euphoria when doing certain ""feminine"" things (i.e. wearing rings/jewelry, doing my hair a certain way), but I also have little moments of euphoria when doing more “masculine” things as well (i.e. cuffing my sleeves to show my arms/muscles, wearing men's boxer briefs). In other words, certain things I do evoke gender-y feelings in me and make me feel more ""feminine"" or ""masculine"" and bring out those sort of energies. But nothing that makes me identify strongly with either male or female the same way other people seem to. It's almost as if my baseline is nothingness (or maybe it's just my cis brain not having to think about gender?) but every once in a while I feel small surges of masculine or feminine energy and it makes me happy. Is this a thing?

When it comes to pronouns I'm most comfortable with she/her, but idk if that's because I'm actually female or if it's just because that's what I've used all my life and it's what I'm used to. I'm mildly repulsed when I think of male pronouns being used for me, and they/them doesn't feel right either. 

I guess my biggest question is, for those of you who do feel gender, how often do you experience it? Is it a constant knowing/feeling that you are a particular gender? Or is it more the little things that remind you of it, like I described? Again for me, aside from those small moments of masculine/feminine energy, there really is no constant feeling that I am any particular gender, I just feel like me and don't think about it all too much.

Anyways, I’ve been with my partner for 8 years now, and we have two very young kids together.  When we first got together he had told me that he enjoyed cross-dressing, but expressed that it was purely a “kink”.  We tried it out in the bedroom and it’s just not my thing and made me uncomfortable but I expressed to him that it is totally okay to express that side of himself.  He was understandably upset about it, but agreed that if it was making me uncomfortable it wouldn’t be part of our sex life.  In hindsight I totally admit that it is very repressive of me, but, guys, I don’t typically want sex.  When I do I’d like it to be as bland and quick as possible.  Maybe that’s my own trauma, but I’m not here to talk about that part of our lives.  

Which brings me to why I am here.  Recently my partner has come to me and expressed that he wants to dress “more feminine” and asked me if I was okay with this.  I, trying to be as supportive as possible, told him that I support him in however he wishes to express himself.  It began with feminine lounge pants and nail polish, and has slowly been evolving into what I believe is considered “genderqueer” or “NB.” I’m an educator so while I am an ally and fully support my students, I never thought it would be so close to home.  

My partner is now talking about shaving his legs and his facial hair—wearing crop tops and women’s underwear.  He is trying his best to accommodate my fear of all this change, but it’s just a lot and I don’t want him to feel like I’m repressing him again.  I’m trying to be as supportive as possible but I’m struggling to moving past my own negative emotions.  I don’t believe it to be transphobia, but rather a fear of the colossal stress this transition is putting on our relationship at a time when I’m feeling very deep underwater managing my anxiety.  

I want to be a supportive partner and guide him down a path where he can, eventually, feel comfortable with himself.  I want to set up boundaries so we stop miscommunications before they happen.  I have no clue where to start. I don’t have a clue where to start the conversation about pronouns. I don’t have a clue how to appropriately express my anxiety about how he will be treated.  I don’t know where to even begin as we go through this together.  What questions do I ask?

**Thinking beyond the binary.**

Not all of us are fluent in the language of gender, and too often, we confuse gender with sex, which can leave room for a lot of confusion.

Many agender people also identify as genderqueer, non-binary and/or [transgender](https://gender.wikia.org/wiki/Transgender). However, some agender people prefer to avoid these terms, especially transgender, as they feel this implies identifying as a gender other than their assigned gender, while they, in fact, do not identify as any gender at all.

Pride month is always an avenue to find resources to discover your gender and sexual identity.

In an ideal society, I believe that kids should grow up gender-neutral, because 1. this makes sure they don't miss any development in an area that is normally assigned to the 'other' gender (e.g. not learning to nurture or build), and 2. this makes 'choosing' a gender more pleasant.

Also, in general I believe that the typical gender roles in society should disappear.

However, a major part of our existence is finding someone to love. If you prefer to have sex with/ love someone that has a vagina or penis, how can this be shown from the outside?

I believe that this is the main historical point why gender appearance has evolved (i.e. what is typical male/female clothing / fashion / hair style), such that people can easily recognize the 'group' that you are part of. How could there be a perfect society, where you can't see any difference between any gender, where people still know what is in your pants?

I enjoy dressing in feminine clothes, lingerie makes me feel very sexy. I also have a host of kinks, I identify as submissive, which I think are healthy to explore.

2020-07-19 03:45:05,htu45b,4,5,"Title sums it up. I'm going to try to lay out everything here, so please forgive me if this gets long and a little tmi, I'm trying to be detailed without being explicit.

Lets start in the beginning. I am AMAB, but ever since I was a little kid, we are talking as young as 5, I was fascinated by gender bendering (such as that one Fairly Odd Parents Episode). I had the occasional dream about changing genders, the earliest I can recall was at 6 or 7. Around 12 I started watching mtf makeup transformation videos. I thought I ws getting in trouble when I was caught watching them, but in hindsight I think my parents were trying to discern my feelings on such things. Predictably, I gave them little.

At 12ish I began occasional crossdressing in my moms stuff when home alone. I did not get a sexual thrill from it, I just enjoyed it. I do not know if it was because it was taboo, or because of what it was. I eventually stopped after trying on a friends short-shorts at a pool party. Got caught, then was taught the birds and the bees (in hindsight, I think my parents thought something more explicit was occurring there). I did try on my cousins stuff a few times, and it felt like an enjoyable action.

I discovered self-pleasuring at 13, and began doing so almost exclusively to gender bending and feminization content. This remains true to today. As I matured, I slowly began hating 3 things about myself: my weight (entirely my fault there, and still is. I like food and I like eating), my deep voice (singing any popular song in the last 10 years is not easy with a voice as deep as mine. It's also not a great sounding one anyway), and my build. I'm literally 2 feet across at the shoulders. That's not hyperbolyMy whole torso is a box. And so any clothing looks poor on me, let alone feminine ones, which I sometimes daydreamed about getting.

I'd day dream throughout high school, and from time to time, it would be about wearing feminine clothes or makeup. As time went on, and I matured sexually, I realized I was bi, and primarily attracted to feminine guys. Then comes college.

Three things occurred: I a) bought a piece of feminine undergarment, and b) began having such dreams again, though rarely. One sticks out as two people, both of whom are me, but don't look like me, seemed to be debating my gender. One for boy and other for girl. I can't recall the ending, but I think it was either resolved on boy, or no resolution was found. and c) I became increasing interested in methods that could alter my appearance without spending my money too much.

Then comes this virus. I am home, not on campus, and over the last month and a half, 2 months, dreams about gender bending or dressing as the opposite sex, it is hard to tell on account of not looking at my nethers, have been significantly increasing in frequency. I've had several back to back, but on average its now once a week at least. I enjoy these a lot, and are often sad when they end. There increase, however, also coincides with making a friend who is a crossdresser/femboy, and discussing some of my experiences with him. So I have no idea if it was just cause it was in my mind to cause a dream, and then having such a dream has spawned more as I think about them.

Additionally, I notice that when I look at women around my age, it is often with as much jealousy as admiration, usually at their clothing and way of acting. Like I want to be wearing that, or be able to wear that and look good in it.

Overall, I'm trying to sort these feelings out. I'm I just turned on by such things (thinking about crossdressing or any of this usually excites downstairs, though not always) and are conflating a fetish to something bigger. I'm a projecting my desired partner onto myself, or vice versa, my desired self onto a partner? I'm rather fond of my buddy downstairs and its function, and I am content with my pronouns, but... I feel like I'd be happier if I present more femininely. Feminine clothing, mannerisms, and a lighter voice. But then I wonder if its a desire to just be skinny (or as skinny as my build can healthily permit) being combined with a fetish or desired type of partner, and a general want to be seen as cute, not handsome or manly. So I'm doubting myself, and doubting my doubts, and it is just becomes a circle.

So I think that is everything, and I know no one can come to a conclusion but me, but some help on what this may be could be nice. And I also know professional help would likely help, and I intend to get some soon, before the end of the week. Interestingly, the thought doesn't fill me with anxious excitement, like something like this usually would, but an anticipation excitement.

This might get a little long I just don't know what I feel and it's honestly so difficult for me to figure out. 

Start off I am afab and also moved out so I'm safe in that regard. I have pretty amazing parents in the sense that even though it was rocky at first they accept and love me for being a lesbian. But I've had some real issues in the past with my parents. Not to get into past trauma but basically being called a ""drama queen"" or ""attention seeker"" was quite common for my mom to call me. I never felt this way and I never wanted attention on me? I have been a shut in since I was young, I hate attention. With my childhood and my mom and I's relationship I have an issue being able to tell if I'm actually feeling something? Like it's hard to discern whether I am feeling for me or feeling for/against her. 

One of the biggest reasons I am having issues is that back when I was 16 (21 now) I thought I was ftm trans and I came out to them. My dad was fine with it but my mom basically ended up telling at me that if I was she would have known so I stopped wearing my masculine clothes and kinda slammed down the button of femininity. So it's really hard for me to think about gender and I shoved it down for 5 years and having a girlfriend who is an enby and multiple supportive friends I have been able to feel for the first time in a long time. 

One more big aspect, I have always hated my chest, I ""developed"" early on in life, and I have always hated them. Everyone knows this, but when I was a preteen and trying to be like all the other kids I started to dress we will say ""less conservative?"" And I was showing off cleavage and all of that, then I went back to hating my chest when I realized the attention I was getting was not wanted nor did I feel any better about flaunting myself. Basically I have always wanted my chest to be flat. And I guess that is a dysphoria in itself. 

Now my issue is, I have talked to my support systems and they all say the same thing of constantly thinking about gender and wishing things were different isn't something a cis person would generally do? So I want to believe that I just know I have disconnected my feelings in such a way that I can't feel what I am?? I'm a bit uncomfortable when people refer to me as girl or she/her but I always equated that to what I believed was just internalized sexism. I feel like a fake, a fraud, like I am attention seeking and in 5 months I will be back to being cis. I will never like my chest and I have wanted top surgery since I found out you could get it (13/14) I don't experience bottom dysphoria, but I wish I could be more masculine. 

I am sorry this is a lot of rambles and I don't know if I'm coherent. But basically:

TLDR: If I constantly want to be something different from how I am perceived, am I just doing it so I can be a ""special snowflake""? And how do I know if I'm not just faking it?

And also any advice on how to talk to parents would be wonderful, because I really need my mom's support through this and I don't want it to happen like last time.

I've been thinking about this stuff for *years*, and I've sort of hit a stumbling block. I know that gender identity and gender expression don't always line up; there are masculine women, feminine men, feminine genderqueer people, etc. of all biological sexes and transition paths. It is possible for two AFAB people to have the same exact masculine gendered traits, but one identifies as a woman while the other identifies as genderqueer.

But gender identity and expression aren't *totally* unrelated, right? Otherwise, how could dressing to ""match""--implying that certain ways of dressing are seen as girly or boyish--one's felt gender identity relieve dysphoria? I feel funny when I cut my hair very short, but I also feel funny when I wear a very pink dress or high heels. The feeling might even be something like dysphoria, I'm not sure. But I've thought about it a lot and I am 110% sure that I identify as a woman, even though my relationship to womanhood is somewhat different than what is ""typical"". 

I know dysphoria =/= trans all of the time, but why would I feel dysphoric if my gender identity matches the gender people perceive me as--which I *know* it does? (Except when I get misgendered as nonbinary, which actually makes me really uncomfortable.)

i love my tits when im naked, they bring me so much pleasure in sex &amp; kink, they look amazing tied up in jute. if i could walk around shirtless without being sexualized, i would bc i feel so confident &amp; powerful when im naked. i hate seeing myself in the mirror when clothed &amp; not binding, the lumps make me wanna vomit. i hate that there is so much *feminine energy* that culture &amp; society has nestled in my bosom &amp; i can't get it out of my mind that losing my tits would be losing a piece of my womanhood, my wisdom &amp; intuition, the resilience ive developed bc of my experiences as a woman. i love snuggling my lil spoon, pulling them closer and smushing them in my boobs. 

most partners i have don't touch my tits enough anyway, i havent had a rope/sadistic top that played a them the way i crave in ages anyway, I'm holding on to them, holding out for that future pleasure but the pain, every day, the intense self hatred, binding in the summer is awful, i could swim at the beach &amp; not think about it, it would be so comfortable slipping deeper into my masculinity... 

my tits, the only relationship to femininity that made me feel good, that made sense to me, i love my body, i cant grow a dick but i have my tits. i love being daddy w tits, fucking w gender expectations is intensely satisfying.

but... every day... so much emotional, mental energy on the presentation of my tits. such love for parts of my body. would getting rid of them bring on a new daily pain? the idea of playing w feminity when i have more markers of masculinity sounds appealing to me... what if i regret it. god then id really have to come out to mothership, relationship already sooo tenuous, we just started talking again after a year no contact... i dont want an inauthentic relationship w her, but covid depression is already so debilitating i cant handle a bigger falling out w her, i mean do i HAVE to tell her, she doesn't know abt the T, god let gooo. transitioning is self care, transitioning is saying yes to yourself.

no more fear in men's room if im not binding, oh my god my closet of button ups, to wear men's shirt without battling my chest. MY CLOSET OF BUTTON UPS. well fuck, there's the enthusiastic yes i forgot about. sign me up for surgery.

venting to vent helps. feeling extremely sensitive, please no advice. seeking warmth, acknowledgement of these feels, space to just feel. if you've felt similarly &amp; want to share your own relationship w your body, what your dysphoria felt like, decision around y/n to top surgery, or just to vent similarly... i welcome your words.

2020-07-24 07:53:30,hwxr7o,15,6,"Hello y'all

So back I few years ago, I really struggled with my gender identity. I'm AMAB, and when I questioned my gender identity I really focused on the femme parts of my self I wanted to express, but couldn't (mainly due to still living with my parents because I was 14). 

I came out as Bi to my mom, and thru the last few years I really feel less awkward and wierd with my body. I used to have really bad social anxiety witch I believe helped fuel this self hating fire in me that made me so uncomfortable with my male presentation, and as a result I completely rejected my masculinity. 

I had a life changing experience with Psilocybin Mushrooms and as a result I'm not socially anxious anymore. in the year and a half that's followed that, to put in blunt terms, I didn't feel like I was ""a girl"". but when I think that, if I'm not a girl, then I must be ""a guy"". I don't feel like I'm ""a guy"". I figured out that I don't fit into the cisgender binary.

but, I don't care that I don't? I used to feel so convinced that I was 100% a girl, so positive and so willing, but now I'm completely fine that I'm not either. I get to express myself how I want to. I have no inhabitions when it comes to my gender identity. I'm me. I used to cry became I wasn't born AFAB. Now I don't feel any negativity or euphoria in knowing that I'm not cisgender. I don't know if I just don't care about my gender identity at all, or if I'm not feeling how I ""should feel"" about my identity.

TLDR; thought I was trans, wasn't, did mushrooms, now I don't care about my gender identity

It's a feeling I can't remember not having, but have always dismissed and pushed aside. Lockdown has made me think a lot more about it, and now it's on my mind a lot. I guess I just want some reassurance that I'm not going crazy, and to figure out if there's a label that fits me and the way I am - I like labels a lot, I find they help me to make sense of things.\n\nYes, I'm stressing a bit about posting this, but I'd just like some reassurance and I know I can talk to you lot about this when I can't turn to anyone in my life right now. So thanks in advance, I guess."", 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Questioning my gender, wondering if you could help me figure things out', 'created': 1595773832.0}"

2020-07-26 23:47:54,hyhhcp,11,1,"Hello friends, I just needed a space to express my complicated feelings about my gender. With so much time isolated in quarantine these past few months, I've noticed a lot of what used to be 'background noise' when it comes to my gender identity coming to the forefront in a way that's become more difficult to ignore. I'm both excited and terrified because I'm 31 and in a very healthy long-term relationship with a cisman that I love very much who describes himself as 'mostly straight', and there is a lot I love about how I've developed my life and the wonderful friends and family I have around me. I feel like coming out about my complicated gender feelings would make my life even better and strengthen my relationships, but there is definitely a lot of fear about people, especially my partner, not taking it as well as I think or asking questions I don't have the answers to yet. Luckily, my partner has a circle of close cismale friends, including several who are gay and bi, one who is questioning his gender himself, and another who is dating a transman, so I think there is openness there that I might not give him enough credit for. He probably won't even be very surprised, but I hope he will still love me and find me attractive. 

Anyway, my complicated gender feelings are that I love my body and take a lot of pride in being a woman, but I'm not very feminine and cringe more and more that I am called 'Ms.' and 'Ma'am' at work as a martial arts teacher for kids and adults. I'm a high level athlete, and my whole professional life is martial arts, and part of what has felt at home to me there is embracing my masculine side and getting to spend all day in 'neutral' clothes like martial arts uniforms and workout gear. My gender expression has shifted over the past few years to have more masculine elements at times, and I've had a buzz cut for 3 years that instantly made me feel more at home in myself, and I stopped shaving my legs and armpits. I've questioned my sexuality and casually dated women as well as a transman, but I'm mostly straight and am physically attracted to cismen. I spent many years trying to 'play up' my femininity in order to get guys to date me. Although my current partner started dating me after I had made some of these changes to my presentation, he does respond very positively when I 'play dress up' and wear more feminine clothes for formal events or in the bedroom. Dressing up femme is fun for me sometimes, and sometimes I do feel sexy, but it mostly feels performative like I'm in drag. He also likes it when I'm more dominant, so maybe he is fluid like me in that way too. 

I think what I want is to feel accepted in choosing to keep experimenting with masculinity and for this facet of fluidity or queerness to be acknowledged more publicly. I recently ordered my first binder, which should be coming tomorrow, and I want to talk to my partner before he sees me wear it. I want to be called 'Coach' rather than 'Ms.' I still want to be a woman, but that's not all I am -- I want to expand the definition. I'm sure I'm not the only one here to feel this way.

Maybe I’m just venting or something. I don’t mean to take up space. I just want to write this down. It’s okay if you don’t read this, especially if it might be triggering.

I’m amab, almost 26. I’m attracted almost exclusively to women and/or people who present in a feminine way. I don’t think it’s appropriate to discuss my sexual feelings in depth, but. I can be attracted to men’s bodies but RARELY their faces. I don’t hate my own body, but I’m not always okay with my face. Maybe if it was the right guy. But I love women so deeply, I love women as intensely as a tiktok lesbian loves women. That feels kind of wrong to say since my SO is agender. I don’t know.

At some point my SO started jokingly saying “wow, look at my lesbian girlfriend.” Why did that feel so validating?? I’m not sure why they started saying it. They pick up on a lot of things, they have this sort of intuition about things. Maybe they picked up on something. I realized recently that I’ve had romantic contact with three different people who directly told me they were a lesbian while still showing interest in me, if that means anything. 

But I don’t mind being called “he,” or I don’t think I do. And I don’t mind my body, I just want a prettier face. Less angular eyebrows and eyes. I always hated the idea of being called a “man,” but I think I’m getting past that? Was that just because I felt guilty for being a man, because when men are attracted to women that feels inherently predatory to me? I wish it wasn’t so easy to accidentally talk over women, mansplaining and stuff.

Is it normal for kids to not identify with their reflection in the mirror? Isn’t that typical for kids, you only recognize your reflection as yourself when you start puberty?

I think I’ve spent a good amount of my life somewhat dissociated. I mean, maybe that comes with inattentive type ADHD. I guess my face still doesn’t seem like “me.” I forget I’m real a lot. I forget a lot less than I used to, though.

Sometimes I like my face a lot, like in cute selfies or on certain days.

Maybe I’m just looking for reasons to explain why life is so hard. But I know that I’m queer, I have to be. I always have been, and I don’t know why. I don’t know if I would even want to be a girl, and I don’t think I could ever look okay. Trans women are so beautiful and I love their hands and their skin. But I like my forearms with hair, the hair on my forearms is soft and... feminine? Fuck, that really sounds like the transest reason for liking my arm hair. There’s no way I’m not just making this up. 

It probably doesn’t help to be dating someone who is actively uncomfortable with being seen as a woman. I don’t want to be fetishizing femininity or trying to be someone else just because I don’t like myself or something. And I think I should be able to be comfortable with being a man who just likes feminine things because clothes don’t have a gender and stuff. This is fucking stupid, this sounds like stuff someone in the closet would say. And now I’m crying for some fucking reason. 

I’m really waiting for this fucking phase to pass. I never wanted to wear dresses or anything as a kid. In kindergarten I would daydream about falling in love with a girl who would rescue me from some danger and raising Pokemon in the forest together, isn’t that a hetero thing for a boy to think about???? But I remember hating my legs in 12th grade gym class, and telling my friend “I’m not a boy today” and then wondering what the hell I meant. And I remember telling my parents I was trans when I was like 13, when I barely knew what that meant, which I thought was a joke. But that was a WEIRD joke, I don’t make jokes like that to my parents and I ESPECIALLY didn’t back then. 

If you read this, thank you. I don’t really expect anyone to, it just feels good to say it.

2020-07-31 19:22:38,i1dr3b,14,1,"I need to share a bit - it feels like I need some ye' ol' validation.  I have had a rather confusing life gender wise, and it's led to a lot of pain.  I just want to walk through it a bit.  Maybe someone can help me learn the right word(s) to describe myself.

First - I'm not young.  I'm 50.  To be going through this now is - 'very'.  Therefore - with so much history - this post is going to be a wee bit long.  Sorry 'bout that.  It's still only a snapshot.  So much history...

I believe I felt I was different all my life - I can remember dressing up as an undead monster for Halloween when I was six years old, and walking around with a scowl and my arms out however with my hands all limp like that old fashioned zombie walk - and inside, in that costume - I felt I was a \*female\* monster.  I was a \*girl\* creature.  That feeling came with the exploration of 'pretend' and was very strong, and no one noticed me pretending because - I was a monster.  

When I hit puberty, things got rough.  I was emotionally abandoned by my parents - my mom started working evenings (intentionally - she didn't want to be a mom/wife anymore) and pretty much left my life, and - while I'd been the 'golden child' up to that point - suddenly it was like I had no parents at all.  I went through a terrible depression in 5th grade over that, and that abandonment led to many awful things that is a long post in its own right if not an outright book.

I became best friends at the same time with a fairly popular kid who was a 'punk' and folks thought he was cool, and it became codependent - I was so lost from feeling abandoned, and needed someone to guide me, and suddenly the person guiding me was another 11 year old.  He was also a toxic and manipulative fuckwad.  The creature that I am was coming out - and he made it a point to let me know that I was 'effeminate' and that 'everyone thought so too'.  

This was the 80's, in a conservative area of Southern California.  To be anything like a 'f\*\*' was the social kiss of death - our world was hyper-Christian and awful.  For an abandoned kid to be told they are 'effeminate' and 'everyone thought so too' - and there was a part of me that related this to my abandonment - 'is this what is wrong with me?' - it was very painful.

It's when I first started really hiding myself.

When I was 18 I entered the punk/goth scene and \*loved\* it.  As I evolved into that culture, I found a realm where androgyny and bisexuality were badges of honor.  It was a 'safe place' to explore.  I ended up joining some punk/goth bands (I played bass) and often dressed as a goth woman - fishnets and miniskirts and the such.  It was 'controversial' of me to do, and so much fun.  I felt sexy and free and funny and just - I loved it.

I so loved wearing women's things that I began to think I was gay.  This is now the early 90's - we had no idea about sex and gender and orientation being different things.  And it was the goth scene - therefore, finding out if I was gay was easy enough as men flirted with me often - and so, some experimentation happened.  And - guess what? - I \*wasn't\* gay.  Men just don't really do it for me.  Conversely, by that time, I'd had many girlfriends - at least one for a couple of years - and \*loved\* sex with women.

Deep inside, this made me feel as if 'Okay, if I'm not gay, then I must be tricking myself into thinking I like dressing as a woman - I must just be,...you know...some sort of deviant type person...'.  It's like I gaslit myself into thinking I was just 'being weird'.  And so, as I got older, and the scene died, and suddenly I had a job at a friggin' warehouse offloading trucks, and so on - I lost any cultural freedom to experiment any longer, and suddenly I'm back to being a cisgendered male (supposedly).

Lots of life happened, and I eventually married a beautiful and extremely funny and sexy and very popular cisgendered woman.  She was also a sociopathic narcissist and horribly emotionally abusive.  This is another very long book - well, part of the same one.  I never revealed my inner gender to her - I always let her think I was cis-gendered - something inside me told me it wouldn't be wise to share.  And I was right.  The marriage got brutally toxic and awful and nearly anything I'd shared about myself to her over the years was used against me.  There was tons of reputation slaughtering at the end - she spread so many lies about me - it completely and utterly destroyed my life.  I lost most of my friends through her, I lost my job of 18 years, and my fake 'cis gendered' personality completely imploded and died and I lost my freaking mind.

I went through nearly two years of solitary living.  No one visited me; no one knew me.  I trained Muay Thai and got really good at it - and I'm in ridiculous shape.  Training combat sports is all I did.  It was so hard.  The battle with depression and the urge towards suicide was phenomenal.  The only way I got through it was to dissociate and train.  It's how I still get through it.  It was CPTSD - to give it a name - and I don't know how many here have dealt with CPTSD however I will say that it is a very difficult experience.

Over the last year and a half I've finally made new friends.  Theater friends.  I do crazy shit now (yet another long post).  We do 'immersive theater' which is like a play - except for only one person - and they are made to get involved.  The stories we do are dark and violent and bloody - like a crime noir story.  I usually play someone scary - it's so fun.

I could very much go on about that as I love what we do - however, point is - it is an \*extremely\* supportive group of people and everyone is very accepting.  One of my best friends in the group is big in the kink scene, and she's helped educate me a lot about sex and gender.  Further, this quarantine time has given me an excess amount of time to 'experiment' and so - I think who and what I really am is finally starting to come out.

I haven't fully come out to all my friends, yet.  I have said I am 'non-binary' on social media, however haven't posted pictures or described what I mean by 'non-binary'.  However, at home, as I work my remote job - I'm pretty much doing it as a woman, wearing a dress, and letting myself be who I want to be.  And it's amazing.  And frightening.  I look ridiculous - I feel - my body is very male (30 inch waist, 42 inch chest - 'V' shape) and so women's clothes are a bit of a challenge.  

(As a side note, I want to mention my last testosterone measurement from my doctor - 1000.  This is apparently 'teenager' levels of test, and I'm 50.  It's probably high from all the combat training - however, my point is - obviously test does not define internal gender, as here I am with a teenager's level of it and OH that dress looks pretty I want to try it on.)

I'm rambling.  So much to say - the core of what I wanted to do in this post was attempt to describe my gender.  I just wanted to give the backstory a bit.  I've lurked here and other related subreddits and I've seen others phrase things in a certain way, and I want to try.

Please let me know if this sounds 'reasonable', or if it sounds like I'm a crazy person: I feel as if I am a rather fierce gay woman, who so much wanted to be a man that she managed to grow a cock and broad shoulders and everything else that a man has, and this allowed her to fake a cisgendered male life and take up straight women as partners.  However, in gaining this man's body, she also lost who she really was - she lost her womanhood.  And now she has to try to learn to live in this man's body while being honest about who she is, and to never hide it again.  She needs to let herself be herself.

I teared up when I wrote that :(  It is the first time I wrote that.  This is very confusing and difficult.

I have a long way to go in this evolution.  Seeing that I am a woman on the inside is like seeing a destination on the horizon.  I see it now.  But it's a drive.  It's going to take some time.   

Thank you for reading.  I'm sorry I ramble.  I just wanted to try to describe what is inside me, to someone who might feel empathy for me.  I hope you understand.  :\\",genderqueer,I am undergoing an evolution and it is both terrifying and exhilarating...,1596248558.0,"{'created_utc': 1596223358, 'id': 'i1dr3b', 'num_comments': 14, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""I need to share a bit - it feels like I need some ye' ol' validation.  I have had a rather confusing life gender wise, and it's led to a lot of pain.  I just want to walk through it a bit.  Maybe someone can help me learn the right word(s) to describe myself.\n\nFirst - I'm not young.  I'm 50.  To be going through this now is - 'very'.  Therefore - with so much history - this post is going to be a wee bit long.  Sorry 'bout that.  It's still only a snapshot.  So much history...\n\nI believe I felt I was different all my life - I can remember dressing up as an undead monster for Halloween when I was six years old, and walking around with a scowl and my arms out however with my hands all limp like that old fashioned zombie walk - and inside, in that costume - I felt I was a \\*female\\* monster.  I was a \\*girl\\* creature.  That feeling came with the exploration of 'pretend' and was very strong, and no one noticed me pretending because - I was a monster.  \n\nWhen I hit puberty, things got rough.  I was emotionally abandoned by my parents - my mom started working evenings (intentionally - she didn't want to be a mom/wife anymore) and pretty much left my life, and - while I'd been the 'golden child' up to that point - suddenly it was like I had no parents at all.  I went through a terrible depression in 5th grade over that, and that abandonment led to many awful things that is a long post in its own right if not an outright book.\n\nI became best friends at the same time with a fairly popular kid who was a 'punk' and folks thought he was cool, and it became codependent - I was so lost from feeling abandoned, and needed someone to guide me, and suddenly the person guiding me was another 11 year old.  He was also a toxic and manipulative fuckwad.  The creature that I am was coming out - and he made it a point to let me know that I was 'effeminate' and that 'everyone thought so too'.  \n\nThis was the 80's, in a conservative area of Southern California.  To be anything like a 'f\\*\\*' was the social kiss of death - our world was hyper-Christian and awful.  For an abandoned kid to be told they are 'effeminate' and 'everyone thought so too' - and there was a part of me that related this to my abandonment - 'is this what is wrong with me?' - it was very painful.\n\nIt's when I first started really hiding myself.\n\nWhen I was 18 I entered the punk/goth scene and \\*loved\\* it.  As I evolved into that culture, I found a realm where androgyny and bisexuality were badges of honor.  It was a 'safe place' to explore.  I ended up joining some punk/goth bands (I played bass) and often dressed as a goth woman - fishnets and miniskirts and the such.  It was 'controversial' of me to do, and so much fun.  I felt sexy and free and funny and just - I loved it.\n\nI so loved wearing women's things that I began to think I was gay.  This is now the early 90's - we had no idea about sex and gender and orientation being different things.  And it was the goth scene - therefore, finding out if I was gay was easy enough as men flirted with me often - and so, some experimentation happened.  And - guess what? - I \\*wasn't\\* gay.  Men just don't really do it for me.  Conversely, by that time, I'd had many girlfriends - at least one for a couple of years - and \\*loved\\* sex with women.\n\nDeep inside, this made me feel as if 'Okay, if I'm not gay, then I must be tricking myself into thinking I like dressing as a woman - I must just be,...you know...some sort of deviant type person...'.  It's like I gaslit myself into thinking I was just 'being weird'.  And so, as I got older, and the scene died, and suddenly I had a job at a friggin' warehouse offloading trucks, and so on - I lost any cultural freedom to experiment any longer, and suddenly I'm back to being a cisgendered male (supposedly).\n\nLots of life happened, and I eventually married a beautiful and extremely funny and sexy and very popular cisgendered woman.  She was also a sociopathic narcissist and horribly emotionally abusive.  This is another very long book - well, part of the same one.  I never revealed my inner gender to her - I always let her think I was cis-gendered - something inside me told me it wouldn't be wise to share.  And I was right.  The marriage got brutally toxic and awful and nearly anything I'd shared about myself to her over the years was used against me.  There was tons of reputation slaughtering at the end - she spread so many lies about me - it completely and utterly destroyed my life.  I lost most of my friends through her, I lost my job of 18 years, and my fake 'cis gendered' personality completely imploded and died and I lost my freaking mind.\n\nI went through nearly two years of solitary living.  No one visited me; no one knew me.  I trained Muay Thai and got really good at it - and I'm in ridiculous shape.  Training combat sports is all I did.  It was so hard.  The battle with depression and the urge towards suicide was phenomenal.  The only way I got through it was to dissociate and train.  It's how I still get through it.  It was CPTSD - to give it a name - and I don't know how many here have dealt with CPTSD however I will say that it is a very difficult experience.\n\nOver the last year and a half I've finally made new friends.  Theater friends.  I do crazy shit now (yet another long post).  We do 'immersive theater' which is like a play - except for only one person - and they are made to get involved.  The stories we do are dark and violent and bloody - like a crime noir story.  I usually play someone scary - it's so fun.\n\nI could very much go on about that as I love what we do - however, point is - it is an \\*extremely\\* supportive group of people and everyone is very accepting.  One of my best friends in the group is big in the kink scene, and she's helped educate me a lot about sex and gender.  Further, this quarantine time has given me an excess amount of time to 'experiment' and so - I think who and what I really am is finally starting to come out.\n\nI haven't fully come out to all my friends, yet.  I have said I am 'non-binary' on social media, however haven't posted pictures or described what I mean by 'non-binary'.
