2020-05-03 16:29:57,gcth6i,3,1,"  Hi, fat afab person here, age 20. I have been questioning if maybe I'm agender or demiwoman for half a year now and I haven't seen much people that share my experiences, so here I go.

I've been fat since I can remember and I've felt disconnected from my body since I can remember. It was a survival tactic. If the real me was in my head/ a spirit, then when kids were bulling me for my appearance, they weren't REALLY hurting me, just the body I wore. Being fat I had to learn that I will never be considered attractive and my body is either nothing or an obstacle. The only way I can win over people is with my mind/soul. 

So I've been a soul since I can remember. And lately I've realized that there isn't much femininity in that soul. Why be a woman, when I could just be a person, you know? I'm fine with she/her pronouns, but more so in my native language than English (where you have to say ""she"" every time you talk about someone and have the option of they/them; in Polish ""she"" can be skipped as changed verb already tells people someone is a she and there is no they/them). Whenever someone calls me ""a girl"", ""a lady"" or ""a woman""  I get confused and don't realize they talk about me or I feel the sense of danger and wonder how they would use it against me. I don't feel dysphoria, bc my body doesn't matter to me/is not me, but that still doesn't stop me from feeling body dysmorphia bc of my weight, so idk. I also hate the thought of someone seeing me in a sexual way - these are the times when suddenly my boobs stop being gender neutral and start being feminine, and that's when I hate them.

I've never liked overly feminine things, hate dresses, tried doing make up for like a month before I gave up and have had the same long ponytail that makes me look like fat nerdy guy that lives in his mother's basement since forever. 

The only way I think I connect to femininity is through my kind of being a witch (with crystals and tarot cards and all that). I want to look like one, with gothic aesthetic and lace and the whole shabang.  For a while I thought that maybe I just had to find my way to be a woman and that was it. 

Six months ago I started questioning, came to reddit and wrote about it, and told a friend about it. I never wrote/told about the fat part as I have a lot of internalized fatphobia and don't like to talk about it with anyone. I was told both times that I was overreacting.

I stopped thinking about it for a while, so I thought maybe they were right, but then three months ago I started thinking about it again, more and more often and recently I realized that the fantasy I had since high school about being amab femme-presenting genderqueer person that I could never figure out, was maybe me wishing I could be treated as non-binary even when dressing in witchy/gothic/feminine way.

I was told both times that I was overreacting.\n\nI stopped thinking about it for a while, so I thought maybe they were right, but then three months ago I started thinking about it again, more and more often and recently I realized that the fantasy I had since high school about being amab femme-presenting genderqueer person that I could never figure out, was maybe me wishing I could be treated as non-binary even when dressing in witchy/gothic/feminine way.\n\nAnd I came back to square one', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Feeling disconnected from my fat body and being agender', 'created': 1588548597.0}"

--

Afab, 21 years old. I have a hetero cis gendered boyfriend of over 4 years. I've addressed my gender issues with him, and he seems to be supportive. I have thoughts of possibly being trans, but my family is extremely unsupportive and so I would never be fully safe to transition unless I broke all ties with them when I move out, which I don't want to do. I have chest dysphoria and would be happy to have my chest reduced if not have complete top surgery as I have very large breasts. Bottom surgery however absolutely horrifies me. I am dysphoric about my lady bits, but nowhere near as dysphoric as I am about my chest. My boyfriend is also attracted specifically to lady parts, but has previously mentioned he's totally fine with top surgery and even me potentially changing my name. He didn't seem to keen on the testosterone though, which I'm not so sure if I want that yet either. I would never ask him to change his sexuality, that's just unfair. Not to mention, I don't want bottom surgery anyways from fear of complications. 

I have a feminine name and use feminine pronouns, both of which I hate. I go by they/he pronouns online where I'm anonymous, and those feel pretty good. But at the same time, he/him almost feels weird, and I'm unsure if I like that or not.

I have to wear 2 sports bras to make my chest look even slightly smaller (can't bind because of my family), but I also have 2 expensive nice bras that I occasionally feel like wearing that do the exact opposite of flattening my chest. I also have cute feminine vests and cardigans I love wearing on a rare occasion. Otherwise I normally wear baggy men's shirts and women's leggings or shorts since my family won't allow me to wear men's pants. I'll happily wear a masculine-like outfit but add cute hair clips and little makeup hearts under my eyes on an everyday basis. 

Growing up I've always liked the traditionally considered 'boy stuff' and I have many memories of my mom saying ""you know you're a girl, right?"" I've never identified with feminine, well, anything I guess. But there are times I don't feel masculine at all either, and I just simply am. I wish I felt that lack of both all the time to be honest.

--

I'm just not sure what to do or how to identify at all. On some rare days I wanna be fem, but on the majority of days I wanna be masc or just androgynous. I've heard over and over again that you'll ""just know"" if you're trans, but I'm so unsure. I feel very lost about my identity and feelings, and thought maybe non binary or genderqueer was for me.

Thanks so much for reading. I'm super shy so I probs won't reply to many comments if any at all, but please know I will read any at all and I'll be so thankful for your input!

2020-05-05 22:51:15,ge82ma,15,1,"So I've been explaining away signs of gender fluidity and dysphoria for years. But this week I had a breakthrough that I couldn't ignore. I realized that the idea of dressing and presenting femme or gender-noncomforming made me *really* happy. Looking back I'm starting to laugh at all the times I jumped at a chance to *ironically* crossdress or present differently.

But here's my roadblock, I'm incredibly masc presenting. Like, every single one of my features and mannerisms that people know me for are masc. I'm a hairy mixed-POC with a thick beard that grows back in days. There are days when I feel really confident in masculine presenting and some days where all I want is to present as femme. 

I feel like everyone in my life knows me as this broad-shouldered bearded arab guy but sometimes that's the opposite of how I feel inside and I'm paralyzed by the idea of even one person knowing this side of me, even though everyone I know would be incredibly supportive. It just feels like so much work to try and be more androgynous when every part of my features and genes seem to work against that. 

So I guess the point of my ramblings are to ask if anyone else who started as masc-presenting people have any advice on socially and physically easing into a more femme or androgynous presentation, and how to reconcile your outward appearance with how you feel inside.

2020-05-07 05:22:09,gf0hxn,1,1,"So I've been on the fence about this for a few months now and I'm not sure if this is a case where I actually am genderfluid or if I'm just over complicating my feelings about how I view myself.

The more I look into trans and non binary information the more I start to question myself.

When I was young I was definitely more of the tomboy type. Not really the down and in the mud type of girl but often really rejected most feminine things like dresses and anything pink and so on.

Though when I was in Jr. High I instantly fell in love with the lolita fashion though have never made the move to really give the fashion a chance on myself both because it's an expensive style and I always feared what my reaction would be to seeing myself actually in any kind of outfit.

You see, even now I seem to have a 50/50 chance of...how to put it...rejecting myself when it comes to traditional feminine clothing I guess I could say. Like despite if I absolutely love the clothing as an aesthetic, I don't always love seeing it on myself. Like even if I own or have worn something vaguely familiar and love it both as a clothing item and how it looks on me, others can just enact a ""no, this is wrong, I don't look or feel like a girl while wearing this"" even if there aren't many differences between some article of clothes. I don't think I would classify it as dysphoric because I don't feel like I'm rejecting the gender I was born as. But more so a random toss up of what does make me feel good and happy when presenting more strongly on the feminine spectrum. And it's confusing because it's so random.

Though it's not like I really present strongly on the masculine end either? Like I do love just existing in comfortable clothes, stuff that's much more loose fitting and often those tend to be men's clothes. Still, I also know that it's not as if I feel like I'd have to present as any kind of hyper masculine appearance if my masculine feel is more geared towards low effort and ease of living. But at the same time I'd wonder if such a loose sense of masculinity in terms of presenting would warrant considering myself as gender fluid or if it's more akin to tomboy. Though I also then wonder if tomboy in and of itself could be a small aspect of gender fluid.

I guess a bigger question would be, is it possible to consider yourself as genderfluid even if you may lean heavier towards presenting as one gender over another, especially if that gender coincides with the sex you were born as? Or maybe it's better to ask if it would be okay to consider myself as genderfluid in that case? Like if it's more a case of being a tomboy who has instances of being able to feel and present more traditionally on the feminine side? Or if that in and of itself could be seen as genderfluid?

Before I started questioning my gender I thought I was a cis bi girl. I never really liked guys, but I thought that theoretically I could like a guy. I realized now that I'm actually nonbinary and probably gender fluid. 

I had a conversation with a friend once who was asking me if I was really bi since I only seemed to be interested in girls. I told her that I do like guys, but that if I was in a realtionship with a guy, he'd be straight and that's not right? Like I could never be in a straight relationship with a man. It just doesn't make sense to me. She was really confused by this and so was I. If I liked a guy I'd want him to see me as one as well?

Liking girls makes me feel so feminine and liking guys is so masculine. When I'm in boy mode I feel more attracted to guys and not interested in girls. But in girl mode I don't understand how I ever liked guys. I feel like a lesbian. I like nonbinary people regardless of my fluctating gender.

2020-05-11 03:16:38,ghfq84,2,1,"My appointment is next Thursday, I’m absolutely terrified because on one hand part of me wants it so badly but the other part of me is terrified. I only plan on going on a low/“microdose” of gel to keep the changes as slow as possible but I really need input of other people’s experiences with low-dose?

For one, I‘m nervous about how I might look? Unfortunately I place most of my value in my appearance as I don’t have much else going for me (not that I think I look good either lmao) but it feels difficult for me to predict anything of what I may end up like. I’m 19, turning 20 next Friday. My dad is a muscular gym buff and super masculine type of guy but my mom says he used to be very skinny. My brother is 17 and I look wildly similar to him, he’s very lanky too. So that’s fine as I don’t want to gain a ton of weight.

I guess what I’m asking here is how much of T is really genetic? Is my brother a good idea of what I may end up like roughly? 

My other questions are regarding acne and facial and body hair. I never had acne in first puberty, and going back to my brother he never had any either. Is severe acne completely inevitable or is that more generic too? On low dose, when did you start seeing facial hair come in and is laser hair removal / electrolysis effective while on T? How likely is head hair loss on a low dose?

If you ever went off T, did you go through menopause? 

ALSO the “puffy face” thing is concerning too? Did you experiece your face getting really puffy on a low dose? 

I think those are the main things I’m concerned about, everything else is smaller or controllable. I’m concerned about increased sex drive as I’m a very sex repulsed ace with a lot of negative feelings towards sex. Changes in smell are concerning but I can shower, and as long as the smell isn’t bad its honestly probably going to be completely fine with me. I haven’t really seen anyone saying if they felt they smelled worse, just that they smelled different. 

I know listing out all my concerns makes it sound like I don’t want T. What I do hope for is fat redistribution, a more masc-leaning face, a better voice, etc. My dysphoria is extremely extremely severe surrounding the shape of my body and its anatomy, but I guess some effects of T seem scary because I place so much value on appearance but I know I can’t keep surviving in my body as it is now, so its a catch-22 of wondering if I should be miserable but not deal with the potential discomfort of change or have a chance at looking more like myself but have it be unpredictable. 

I plan on asking these things to the endocrinologist too but I’m looking for as much anecdotal stuff as possible too.

Hey guys, I need help. I came out to my parents as queer and they did not take it well at all... They’re actually kicking me out at the end of the month. They wanted to sooner but I managed to make them let me stay for a little while at least since I already paid rent for the month of May with the last of my savings. I’m disabled and chronically ill so it would be hard for me to find a job normally, never mind with this whole pandemic happening. I’ve had to get into sex work just to survive but it’s barely enough to keep me fed, let alone get an apartment. As of May 9th they’re cut off my food, cause they’ve “wasted enough money on me already.” I have a possible roommate but even if they don’t fall through, it’ll be $400+ a month for an apartment, plus I have to buy my meds out of pocket since my parents have taken me off of their insurance plan. I don’t want to be homeless and I don’t want to end up hospitalized. Anything you can contribute is really really appreciated. I hate to ask like this, but I have no other choice and I’m desperate.

Partly due to that upbringing and taking a while to more or less wrap my head around things, I’ve not fully come out, especially in work related areas. 

I initially started out as a high school teacher, again in a fairly conservative rural area and I’ve since transitioned to being a children’s librarian. Where I’m currently at is a more accepting community overall, but still riffe with issues.

2020-05-14 13:50:13,gjmprk,2,1,"Hi, everyone. I’ve never been here before. For the past couple of weeks I’ve been lurking on reddit in search of a safe place to ask for advice, and I’ve found this community, which seems filled with welcoming, warm and supportive people. I’m not sure if this is the right place to ask for advice.. or vent my fears, but if it’s not, I apologize.

To get to the point: I am a pansexual guy, who suffers from various psychological disorders, some of which are tied directly to my overactive imagination. I fantasize a lot, in short. About everything. Most of the times I think I realize which things I actually fantasize about because of personal desires, and which instead are just aimless fantasies I play with for fun. Other times, it gets more complicated. I always fantasized sexually about other men, but It was just about five years ago that I accepted that I was not straight. Not because I had any problems with being anything else. I was just completely oblivious of the fact, even though when I think about it in retrospective, it was quite clear. 

Now, I’m having similar doubts about my gender identity. I fantasize sexually, and have for a long time, about being a woman. And sometimes, I get a voice in the back of my head that whispers ‘what if you are?’ I’ve just always refused to listen. It terrifies me. I say sexually, since it is thanks to those fantasies that I’m having doubts, because I fantasize about being other people, with different genders, from different nationalities, all the time. But I never really disliked being me. So I always told that to myself, whenever the doubt rose. ‘I’m just playing with my mind, like I always do’. 

But then, recently, I gave in to the voice. I listened to it. And asked myself ‘what if I am? Do I want to be?’ And I do. Of course, I do. It didn’t help. I want to be everyone, if you ask me. I would’ve liked to be born.. well, everywhere, just to experience life from a different point of view. So I asked myself ‘would you rather be male or female?’ And I don’t have an answer to that. I started fantasizing, dreaming a possible future in which I identified as a woman. And I liked it. I loved it, in fact. Of course, I saw all the trouble that would come along with it. I imagined the harassment, the transphobic assholes I would meet, the reactions of my dearly beloved. At some point I was unable to get into a lesbian bar because I wasn’t considered a woman. A similar thing happened to a friend of mine IRL, so I was afraid it might happen to me. I cried as I pictured telling my parents. I looked in a mirror inside my mind and couldn’t fully picture myself as a woman. All I saw was my big nose, the gap between my front teeth, my hairy legs. In my fantasy I had a supporting girlfriend named Sofia. She always told me I looked lovely. Called me by my name, Delilah. Always bit the butt of her pens. It was so cute. And in my fantasy, despite all those hardships, I also loved myself. Often pictured myself in skirts. I never knew I liked skirts so much and yet I always tell my girl friends how I envy how much more beautiful their clothes are. 

Then I came back to reality.. I always have to forcefully pull myself away from my fantasies before I spend days in a comatose state, dreaming of life but never living it. I looked in the mirror and disliked what I saw, because I was still Delilah in my mind, you see? But Delilah wasn’t me. I never disliked my body. When I was younger, I disliked my nose, the gap in my teeth, yes, but then I grew up and saw that I actually looked rather handsome, with those features. Generally, when I look in the mirror, I like what I see. I’m skinny, rather short, for a guy, I’ve always been told, but it never really bothered me. But then seeing myself as a woman, I hated all of it. My messy beard, the nose, the teeth, my lips, the hairs over my body.. Yet I chucked it away. Can’t do anything about it, now, I told myself. My plan was to tell my therapist. As soon as we can actually meet each other, I will, but with this covid stuff, we’re restricted. I don’t feel safe, talking about this in my home. 

Still, it won’t go away. Sometimes I take back that fantasy, or create another one. I always have to stop myself. I don’t create fantasies that are too convoluted most of the time. It always hurts a bit to come back to the real world afterwards. Don’t know if any of you can relate to that. Porn is ruined for me.. well, not ruined, ruined, it’s just that now, I often look at the girls and envy them. I get sad and the moment’s gone like smoke in the wind. I want to have sex with them, you see, but at the same time, I want to be them and have sex with the person they’re having sex with. It was always like that, now it just feels more real, rather than just fantasy. 

The other day my sister went out for a while with my mom. I went into her room and tried on some of her clothes. A dress first. I liked it. It made it seem like I had boobs, even though I’m flat as a plank, obviously. But then I tried on a shirt, with a skirt. And I loved it. Especially the skirt. It was strange. I loved the feeling of being in it. Like when I walk down an empty street at night and I’ve got a long overcoat, and the wind blows it behind me, making me feel like a mysterious badass from a detective story. It was like that, but I didn’t feel just cool, I felt cute too. But then I looked at myself and saw my beard and my nose and I didn’t like it. I don’t know if this sounds offensive, I apologize if it does. Nothing wrong with a guy in a skirt. I just wanted to be a girl in a skirt. 

So here I am. Because I still can’t take it off my mind. I apologize profusely for the length, or if my english is confusing (not a native speaker). I just get really caught up in my writing. Anyways, I don’t know what it is exactly I am asking. I’m really confused. Do I identify as female? Do I identify as male? Or maybe as both? I am soo confused. Kinda scared. Also a bit sad now, but that’s my dear old friend depression, knocking on my door. I don’t want to be offensive by seemingly taking this lightly. I’m not. I don’t know if I appear to be. I’m sorry. I get panicky. This is hella long. Thanks for reading.

TW for mention of female body parts, internalised h/mophobia, aph/bia and tr/nsphobia.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know who I am. I was so sure I was a girl. I am a girl, aren't I? I have to be a girl. Being outside of the gender binary is bad. My dad would hate me forever if I was not a girl. I am a girl, what am I talking about?

I have always been supportive of the Trans and Non binary community, ever since I first heard of them. If someone tells me they are transgender, I am ride or die for them. I will always be the first to start using their new names, new pronouns and supporting all they do.

But with non binary, it is different. I struggle far more with keeping to the non binary pronouns they/them. I always correct myself, I try practicing using they/them pronouns, but I always seem to slip up, much to the disdain of my sister \[who is LGBT\].

I live in a very h/mophobic, aph/bic and tr/nsphobic environment. I suffer with internalised h/mophobia towards myself constantly, I hate being asexual so much, why can't I just be normal? It took me years to accept my bisexuality, but I still struggle with the - what if it is all just a phase? Mentality. I wish I was just normal.

I first questioned my gender at age 13, coming out as a trans man named Lucas before realising I just hated myself so much, I was trying to be someone else. So I went back to being a girl, a normal human being. I wasn't a boy, so I was just a girl, right? Nothing else to it.

But yet, something still wasn't right. I know I am a girl, why do I keep asking myself if I am non - binary? I'm just a girl. Yet my feelings will always resurface.

I don't hate my small t/ts, yet I would rather they weren't there than they were. I also think my own genitals are disgusting. But that's just because I'm asexual, right? Society oversexualises these parts of females, so that's why they are so disgusting to me. It's not because I am not a girl, surely?

I am always wearing shirts, jeans and a jumper. Wearing dresses fills me with an overwhelming sense of discomfort, and skirts are just as obnoxious. But that's because I am tomboy, surely? I just want to try and fit in with the non-binary crowd because that's the trendy thing to do. So I believed.

&amp;#x200B;

Please, help me. Do you think I fall under the non binary umbrella... I just wanted some answers.

Is this normal? I realised I was trans about five years ago (I'm AFAB) and went through a ftm gender transition. Two years on t and top surgery a year ago. I was so uncomfortable as a woman and so euphoric when I could finally transition but now I'm starting to question that (I'm 26 and my life is finally going ok)

My fiance is AMAB and recently came out to me as NB, he presents like a long haired bearded femme guy and uses he/him pronouns. I'm wondering if I might be the same? Or if maybe I'm kind of fluid and feeling like a girl sometimes? 

The scariest thought is that I might regret transitioning. I'm not buying into the TERFy bs and I know it's really uncommon to genuinely regret it. But I'm wondering if I might and what to do if so. I'd just be a girl without boobs and with a deeper voice, but now I feel so good with my new muscles and broad shoulders and narrower hips and more angular build. I used to be super curvy and hated it. But in saying that I've had an ED for 15 years and I'm wondering if I wasn't dysphoric so much as dysmorphic. 

I'm wondering if it's partially because I had such nicer interactions with queer women than queer men. I know it's not representative but the queer men I've known have rarely been decent whereas most queer women are amazing. I'm bi and identified as a bi woman for about five years. I miss the solidarity of queer women compared to the pettiness and nastiness and judginess of the queer men I know. 

Does anyone have any advice? Have any of you been through anything similar? I thought I was finally done doubting myself but now it's back again and I don't know what to do.

Now, of course, nothing in  my life can be a trend and I have to commit to everything. &lt;-- This is an entirely different issue that I'm discussing with a therapist but it does play into what I'm experiencing about possibly being non-binary.

I always go back to the pink bike incident in my past. It seems so superficial...But like.. it’s a ""what could have been"" kinda thing.

When I was 6 dad took me to get my first bike so he could teach me to ride. I got to pick it out.

Well

I was supposed to get to. I wanted the pink bike with the streamers coming out of the handles. This, uh...This did not go over well with my father... I know that kinda sounds like a “I put on my mom’s heels and I just knew” kinda thing but it’s not so much a me knowing as it is a.....if I’d been allowed to be me...how different would that be? Would I be comfortable being male if I'd been allowed to just be me? Is it because I wasn't allowed to do and say and act how I wanted that now maleness feels weird and disconnected from who I could be/want to be? Would I have been nonbinary even if I had been allowed to live out my life as myself? The pink bike thing is seriously one example of many I could pull but it's the first instance where I remember having my expression dictated by my assigned gender.

Of course I was looking over non-binary genders and found demiboy and demigender and was like ""oh. of course they have genders that appear to align with what I'm feeling,"" haha.

I can say that.. typing all of this out.. there’s some comfort in my brain about at least admitting I don’t feel comfortable in my gender/gender expression. There's still a lot I want to explore mentally and most of it is just those extremist kinda questions that arise from never having thought deeply about these things before. I'm very afraid. And, ya know, ""fear means it's real"" or something like that, haha.

But I guess what I really want to know from people who have lived a non-binary experience and been learning what that means and looks and feels like is... Does this sound like gender dysphoria? Am I allowed to explore being non-binary even if I do ultimately decide I'm comfortable living as a male who's gender expression just varies from the conventional; the binary?

For as long as I can remember, I have been a tomboy. I used to like boy and girl toys as a kid, but always enjoyed the boy toys a bit more. As a kid, I befriended girls easily. But as I grew older it became harder to relate to girls my age and easier to relate to guys (but I can't relate 100% to them either). But I still act in ways that would be considered feminine, like I think with my emotions, I am not a big fan or working out. These are just some things that I can think of on the top of my head, had some writers block with this section.

Hated pink and stuff that was very girly. I grew to hate dresses and skirts. I used to look in the boys section for cool t-shirts. My mother bashed me wanting to wear mens clothes. This made me want to do it more. Over the years she grew to accept it more but she is still against it. This isn't entirely her fault I guess, she was raised in a time where this stuff wasn't really heard of. Anyways this isn't about her, this is about me! 

This isn't the first time I've questioned my gender identity. In 8th grade I thought I was trans. Looking back, this was just a gender expression crisis rather than a gender identity crisis. I tried out the name Nick with some close friends but it just didn't feel right. As previously mentioned, I want to wear mens clothes. Or more likely I basically do. I dress pretty androgynously - either wearing unisex or mens clothes. I still hate dresses and skirts and a lot of things that are feminine (clothing and in general). Right now I guess I slightly feel disconnected from the idea of being a girl. I am fine with she/her pronouns. But if people ever thinks of me as like a girl who likes wearing dresses and acts like a girl that would make me feel bad.

I hate makeup and jewelry as well. I have a deep hatred for jewelry as it's something that disgusts me for unrelated reasons (sensory). I hate the way makeup feels AND looks. I don't think I will ever like those things. And thinking about the fact that I can make children urks me. I never want to have my own biological children (unless I freeze my eggs). It feels unnatural and something I'd never want to do, besides from the pain it would cause. But everyone else probably thinks of me as getting pregnant and having children one day and it makes me feel uncomfortable. I am also not a big fan of my boobs, I wish they were smaller and less noticable. I often wear smaller bras to achieve this. But I don't want to medically transition or alter myself or anything.

If I come to the conclusion I am an enby I'm not sure what would change. I would use she/her because I've been called that my whole life, and it doesn't make me feel uncomfortable per se. I like being called he online but its a little weird in a way and pretty weird irl. I don't think I'd use neopronouns for myself either. I am not sure about the use of they/them or possibly giving myself a nickname, it sounds weird in my head but I might try it out on some online community so if it doesn't work then I can go back to using my current name and pronouns no problem.

2020-05-21 16:31:34,go03bc,35,7,"So, I came out to my family as nonbinary recently. I thought they accepted me. They said they did. Then I had the following text conversation with my father. I don't know what to do, or what I'm doing wrong. Can anyone give me some advice, or even reassurance? Conversation is detailed in full below.







Dad:

Ok - we are concerned about all of the changes that we see in you. 



Me:
It is natural to be concerned. My counselor says that being concerned or even a bit sad is natural when a child transitions. It is a big change, and will take getting used to for sure.



Dad:

I can only speak for me ... and never saw this coming. This is confusing to me. I will always love you and care about you... You confuse me sometimes... You told us on Facebook that you were Binary (spelling) and now it seems that you want to be a girl. I have no idea what it is that you want to be. To me you will always be Michael my son, the smartest man I ever met. That person that when he puts his mind into achieving something— he never fails. 



Me:

And I am still that person. I am still that person, and that won't change. I just have a name and pronouns I prefer. But that has to change absolutely nothing about me. All it does is let me be more fully open. I can love glitter and guns, and like nail polish and still love martial arts. It is just me being fully honest with myself about what makes me myself, but none of what you know is changing. I am still your child, still the same person you know, just happier and more open with myself. Also, to clarify, ""nonbinary"" means that I identify completely with neither gender, but gravitate between both. So some days I may feel/be more feminine, and some days more masculine. But just because I prefer a name and different pronouns does not change my past or my future, it doesn't change the person you know me to be. It just means that I am happier and much less stressed because I can be open about those things.



Dad:

When did you decide to make the change? My concern is that you are loosing interest on all the stuff that you loved(guitar, writing, working out, tattoos, your religion,the love of wanting to be with others. You don’t have to be someone else to be accepted, you have to accept who you are.... you are a great person. This is what I see from someone looking from the outside: When you were dating [girlfriend] you love tattoos, meat and Viking things, [other girlfriend] you liked to workout, healthy kicks, With [wife] — lock picking, girls things—- I see you adapting to what they want you to be. You have to adapt to your partner, but not lose you. You have so much untapped potential and abilities that most people will never have. You have to believe in yourself and yes, adapt to your partner .... don’t lose your personality. I don’t know if it makes sense or not. Don’t want to be hurtful- my intent is to give you my point of view.



Me:

I get your concern. But [wife] isn't even into girly things at all. She doesn't like that sort of stuff, so that would have no bearing on me being into it. Does that make sense? As for losing interests, I certainly am not. I still game, I still own guns, I still pick locks, just not on YouTube because I got bored doing the same type of videos. You tell me I am smart, but then believe my partners are making all of these choices for me. I couldn't be smart if that was true. What I mean is trust me, trust me when I say that I am happy, and that I am doing this because I want to, not because anyone is manipulating me. Like I said, [wife] doesn't even like girly things, so that wouldn't even be a factor. :) Plus, I've been working through this since before [wife] and I met; since after I left [girlfriend]. I came out to [wife] first because I trusted her, but not because she made me; she didn't even know me yet. And I have been going by Zoe my entire time at work; my coworkers all embrace that aspect of me openly. But my point in all this is that I'm not being manipulated and I'm not losing interests. I still play the guitar at least once a week; same for the piano and even my old harmonica—I carry that around with me a lot. I still pick locks, I still enjoy my guns. None of those interests have gone away, I can finally just be open about all of my interests, not just some of them. So it's not losing some interests, it is gaining many new ones. I hope this all makes sense, and that you two aren't blaming [my wife] for something that was occurring before she even knew me. I love you guys, and that will never change. The only thing about me that is different is my preferred name and pronouns. Otherwise, I am the same person I have always been, just happier and more free. Oh and as for writing, one of my stories was just published as an audio book. I have not given up on that either. Just because I haven't talked about a thing does not mean I have lost it at all. But I hope both of these messages help you make some more sense of it all.



Dad: Ok — I do think that you are smart.. that doesn’t mean you can’t be manipulated or influence by others. My point is that you continue to seek approval by others on Facebook or any other media that you use, or making such a public thing... why (shocking factor) I cannot ever claim to know how you feel— I know that both you and your sister are the bravest people I know. You get up every day to face a cruel world with a disadvantage that I will never understand... both of you have manage to be successful in spite of mine and your mom’s ignorance of how to best help/guide you to be happy and successful in your life. Why do you want everyone in Facebook/media to know...My friends that ones that count already know... they talked to me about it. That ones that know you are very supportive of us/you, me. When you say transitioning— does that mean that you want a sex change... again here is my confusion.. when you explained binary... you said that you don’t gravitate to either sex .. on the previous text you say that parents get sad when their children are transitioning ... transitioning into what, since everyday you may feel different. I am sad that you are so unhappy and feel the need change your name and your sexuality on a daily basis. Has the name Michael giving you so much pain that you have to change it. Why to do this so publicly? Again, it seems to me that you want the shocking value... and that I don’t understand or agree with you. You may think that I am embarrassed of what my friends would say... again the ones that count... they could care less .. to them you are my child and they are still my friends. I am not asking you to stop posting on Facebook/media... that is up to you how you handled your situations. I am telling I don’t know why you feel the need to deal with this situation in such a public manner. I am not blaming your wife   for anything that you choose to do... just letting you see what I see from my perspective. 



Me:

Ah, I get where you're coming from. To address transitioning, no I definitely do not want a sex change. That had never crossed my mind, trust me on that one for sure. :) As for Facebook, it is not about approval or about shock factor. Being openly nonbinary is still new to me, so I'm still excited to be able to be able to talk about it. It feels liberating to finally be open about it, not because I want others' approval. I don't care what others think of it. It's more because I can finally be open about it, and so I can share all my interests with people, not just some of my interests. To give an example: when I post about gaming, or when I post some writing I've done, like I did a few days ago, it isn't about seeking approval for my gaming or writing. It was/is because I like to share things I am passionate about, and things that are part of who I am. And any of my posts about being nonbinary are the same exact way—not approval-seeking, just me sharing one more aspect of who I am.

To clarify about the word ""transition,"" in this case it has nothing to do with a sex change or anything of the sort. It, in this case, is just is referring to the change of being nonbinary, nothing more than that. No sex change and definitely no sexuality change, just about the change of preferred gender pronouns and name.







So, that is it. What am I doing wrong here? Why would they act accepting of me and then say all of this? For the record, the disadvantage he is referring to is that my sister and I are blind.

I thought they accepted me. They said they did. Then I had the following text conversation with my father. I don\'t know what to do, or what I\'m doing wrong. Can anyone give me some advice, or even reassurance? Conversation is detailed in full below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDad:\n\nOk - we are concerned about all of the changes that we see in you. \n\n\n\nMe:\nIt is natural to be concerned. My counselor says that being concerned or even a bit sad is natural when a child transitions. It is a big change, and will take getting used to for sure.\n\n\n\nDad:\n\nI can only speak for me ... and never saw this coming. This is confusing to me. I will always love you and care about you... You confuse me sometimes... You told us on Facebook that you were Binary (spelling) and now it seems that you want to be a girl. I have no idea what it is that you want to be. To me you will always be Michael my son, the smartest man I ever met. That person that when he puts his mind into achieving something— he never fails. \n\n\n\nMe:\n\nAnd I am still that person. I am still that person, and that won\'t change. I just have a name and pronouns I prefer. But that has to change absolutely nothing about me. All it does is let me be more fully open. I can love glitter and guns, and like nail polish and still love martial arts. It is just me being fully honest with myself about what makes me myself, but none of what you know is changing. I am still your child, still the same person you know, just happier and more open with myself. Also, to clarify, ""nonbinary"" means that I identify completely with neither gender, but gravitate between both. So some days I may feel/be more feminine, and some days more masculine. But just because I prefer a name and different pronouns does not change my past or my future, it doesn\'t change the person you know me to be. It just means that I am happier and much less stressed because I can be open about those things.\n\n\n\nDad:\n\nWhen did you decide to make the change? My concern is that you are loosing interest on all the stuff that you loved(guitar, writing, working out, tattoos, your religion,the love of wanting to be with others. You don’t have to be someone else to be accepted, you have to accept who you are.... you are a great person. This is what I see from someone looking from the outside: When you were dating [girlfriend] you love tattoos, meat and Viking things, [other girlfriend] you liked to workout, healthy kicks, With [wife] — lock picking, girls things—- I see you adapting to what they want you to be. You have to adapt to your partner, but not lose you. You have so much untapped potential and abilities that most people will never have. You have to believe in yourself and yes, adapt to your partner .... don’t lose your personality. I don’t know if it makes sense or not. Don’t want to be hurtful- my intent is to give you my point of view.\n\n\n\nMe:\n\nI get your concern. But [wife] isn\'t even into girly things at all. She doesn\'t like that sort of stuff, so that would have no bearing on me being into it. Does that make sense? As for losing interests, I certainly am not.

2020-05-22 19:01:24,gopirb,12,2,"Hey all,

Today I had my first gender-related appointment, and was taken though all the risks and potential rewards of going on testosterone (I am AFAB, either transmasculine NB or male, I can never quite figure that out). My gender journey has been a bit of an emotional rollercoaster. I've been aware that I am definitely not female for the past 5 years at least, and have been living and passing as a guy in public for the past year or so, and it's been really good. Going forward, I definitely want to live socially as a guy, or at least an NB person who heavily leans to the male side of things, if that makes sense. I see my future as being an uncle, husband etc, or something neutral like a partner.

I'm a very careful person and so I've been agonising for five years non-stop over what I want to do. I know that socially at least I am much happier living and passing as a man than I was as female (I dress completely in men's clothes, naturally have a goatee I can grow and really like, love getting my hair cut short at the barbers etc), but I'm also somewhat cautious about making permanent physical changes. All of the changes on testosterone sound great (although I'm a bit embarrassed and deal with internalised shame for thinking that), except the only change I'm worried about is my voice. There isn't any going back once it's changed, and I'm a bit scared to take a leap of faith. At the same time, I already talk as deeply as I can in most circumstances, so maybe it wouldn't really be as drastic of a change, and maybe I'd really like it.

I've had a few instances where I feel quite intensely scared and embarassed/repulsed by my situation, but at the same time, I've never gone back to feeling female in all those years, so repressing doesn't work. To make matters extra confusing, I don't really have bottom dysphoria, I mainly have social dysphoria and dysphoria about my chest and any curves. I wear a lot of layers every day to keep my chest looking flat, but I miss swimming, and I also know that I'll never feel comfortable dating if my chest stays this way. I find that I constantly try to present as masculine as I can, and that makes me feel the best.

Is it normal to feel a bit frightened of transitioning, despite also knowing it may really help you? On my worst days, I desperately wish I wasn't trans, and a lot of internalised transphobia makes me feel like me transitioning is repulsive. But also I seriously don't want to be my birth sex forever either, so it's awfully confusing haha. Transmasc people who take hormones, were you scared about your voice and such? How can you tell what doubt is worth listening to, and what is just anxiety/internalised transphobia/fear of being different from everyone else etc?

TL;DR: Frickity frick gender is confusing. I've socially transitioned completely, but how can I tell if a physical transition is right for me, when I feel sometimes excited and sometimes scared of it?",genderqueer,"Transmasculine, how to know if it's right to physically transition?",1590199284.0,"{'created_utc': 1590174084, 'id': 'gopirb', 'num_comments': 12, 'score': 2, 'selftext': ""Hey all,\n\nToday I had my first gender-related appointment, and was taken though all the risks and potential rewards of going on testosterone (I am AFAB, either transmasculine NB or male, I can never quite figure that out). My gender journey has been a bit of an emotional rollercoaster. I've been aware that I am definitely not female for the past 5 years at least, and have been living and passing as a guy in public for the past year or so, and it's been really good. Going forward, I definitely want to live socially as a guy, or at least an NB person who heavily leans to the male side of things, if that makes sense. I see my future as being an uncle, husband etc, or something neutral like a partner.\n\nI'm a very careful person and so I've been agonising for five years non-stop over what I want to do. I know that socially at least I am much happier living and passing as a man than I was as female (I dress completely in men's clothes, naturally have a goatee I can grow and really like, love getting my hair cut short at the barbers etc), but I'm also somewhat cautious about making permanent physical changes. All of the changes on testosterone sound great (although I'm a bit embarrassed and deal with internalised shame for thinking that), except the only change I'm worried about is my voice. There isn't any going back once it's changed, and I'm a bit scared to take a leap of faith. At the same time, I already talk as deeply as I can in most circumstances, so maybe it wouldn't really be as drastic of a change, and maybe I'd really like it.\n\nI've had a few instances where I feel quite intensely scared and embarassed/repulsed by my situation, but at the same time, I've never gone back to feeling female in all those years, so repressing doesn't work. To make matters extra confusing, I don't really have bottom dysphoria, I mainly have social dysphoria and dysphoria about my chest and any curves. I wear a lot of layers every day to keep my chest looking flat, but I miss swimming, and I also know that I'll never feel comfortable dating if my chest stays this way. I find that I constantly try to present as masculine as I can, and that makes me feel the best.\n\nIs it normal to feel a bit frightened of transitioning, despite also knowing it may really help you? On my worst days, I desperately wish I wasn't trans, and a lot of internalised transphobia makes me feel like me transitioning is repulsive. But also I seriously don't want to be my birth sex forever either, so it's awfully confusing haha. Transmasc people who take hormones, were you scared about your voice and such? How can you tell what doubt is worth listening to, and what is just anxiety/internalised transphobia/fear of being different from everyone else etc?\n\nThanks in advance! Hope you're all doing well!\n\nTL;DR: Frickity frick gender is confusing.

2020-05-22 19:27:02,goq0a6,3,0,"Hi all - my first post in here.  I throw myself at your feet for counsel.  :)

I'm a mid-40s mom of a couple of kids, my youngest is 12 going on 35.  She's been talking to me about changing up her style, which to this point has been primarily tee shirts and shorts, lots of her brother's hand-me-downs, and pants-NOT-jeans (very specific).  At school she wears button-down shirts with plain pants pretty frequently and has a couple of ties and a sport coat for school concerts.  She has been very clear that she ""feels like a girl and doesn't want to be a boy,"" she just wants to dress like them more.

Since she was 8 or so she has consistently rejected anything ""girly"" in style or fit, though she still has her days when she'll pull out a favorite glittery or cat tee shirt that is getting too small for her, or today she's wearing pink and purple running shorts that have seen better days.

Knowing that she's wanting to figure herself out I'm trying to accommodate her everyday wardrobe, but the trick is that she's quickly reaching the end of girls' sizing, but only the very start of womens'/juniors' sizing.  There is a lot of frustration over basics being not-at-all basic, ruffles and eyelets and that kind of bullshit.  However boys' and young mens' clothing isn't tailored for female puberty, and frankly she's got a shape that doesn't fit the clothes she wants.  She still has some serviceable boy's button-downs but they tend to be way longer than she needs, and her hips aren't the same size as her chest so the fit isn't comfortable.

We did a bunch of browsing online and I know what she likes, but everything she likes is $$$ (naturally!).  I'm hoping to get some advice as to where I could find alternatives that are cheaper especially as she's due to sprout a couple more inches this year (she just grew nearly three in 2019), and if she continues to take after me she's going to have a lot of chest to deal with.

She really wants a suit and we were planning to take her to get fitted right before C19 landed.  She loves everything on this site but adores this one, in particular:  [https://kirrinfinch.com/collections/androgynous-suiting/products/androgynous-dapper-navy-suit](https://kirrinfinch.com/collections/androgynous-suiting/products/androgynous-dapper-navy-suit) 

Which would look great on her and I love it too, but yikes, I can't afford that kind of scratch.  For everyday wear, plain pants and button-down shirts.  She used to like polo shirts but I think they're officially out.  No bow ties, even though I tried to get her interested because I think they're adorable.  My son won't wear them, either.

I've come to the realizing that while I don't necessarily regret transitioning, I regret how I transitioned.

I've always noticed there was this weird disconnect between myself and transgender people, especially transgender women. I always dismissed this as internalized transphobia, and then simply the fact I don't have a lot of common with the majority of transgender women (I meet zero in-group stereotypes.) Eventually, it grew to the point where I stopped calling myself transgender again. While I do think there is a bit of internalized transphobia and cringe, like what Contrapoints talks about in her most recent video, I can't help if I wonder if my therapist and I were onto something several years ago...

I almost transitioned when I was 23, but even though I technically meet the criteria for gender dysphoria, I was so comfortable, confident, and authentic living as a guy that even my gender therapist doubted if I was really trans or maybe was nonbinary. What I mean by that is that I was much less gender nonconforming as a guy than I am now, and was 100% perfectly okay with that. I think there was really was at least some of my masculinity which was authentic. It was less ""I'm not my real or authentic self, but I'm not my whole or complete self."" To this day, I feel the same about who I am now versus before.

For about two years there, I called myself that though I no desire to ever come out because I didn't see the point since I wasn't going to transition. Honestly, I was fairly content with that I identity, I didn't know if I was bigender (what my first therapist said) or gender fluid (my dysphoria came in waves I learned and gender fluid actually fluctuate and I never once felt dysphoric from femininity or being female. Plus, my identity has always felt stable and it was the dysphoria that got worse or better). I called myself a ""guy with gender dysphoria"" and was quite okay with that term.

Then there's also about that time from about 4/5 months into transitioning until about a year into it when I started going full time. I didn't necessarily feel more myself during this time, but I didn't really care if I got misgendered. I told myself ""Well, I'm rather androgynous right now and can't really blame."" Well, over time I started to care because I was sort of, indirectly told, to start caring because it's not okay to misgender trans people.

Honestly, full time has been stressful. I'm constantly worried about how well I pass, suddenly hate being gendered male, and something doesn't feel right thinking of myself as a transgender woman.

I, an AFAB person, feel less cis-ish than most cis women (I think). Gender has been a wild ride for me and I'm not sure that identifying as a woman does anything for me. I have a strong connection with womanhood from being socialized as a Black woman. But that's about it.

On bios, I write something like ""GNC girl"", which feels comfortable for me. The rationale behind this is multi-faceted: a) the linguistic productivity of the word ""girl"" usually leaves more room for ""tomboy"" antics and non-normative behaviors and b) while I can't confirm my own psychology I think part of my reasoning is that still identifying as cis to some extent saves me from constant discrimination and questioning, even though I feel no strong attachment to being a cis woman.

In case any other background is helpful, sexuality-wise I'm queer/pan, my gender presentation is pretty masc and rotates between tomboy casual and stemme fuckboi. I'm a big fan of men's streetwear! I used to be very dysphoric about my breast (which are large) but since sex (TMI) I've been more accepting. I'm opposed to being called things like ""lady"", ""beautiful"" when used as a noun, and any pet name--but that could just be an overall opposition to cis men's creepiness.

Some questions to promote discussion --&gt; 

Has anyone here ever wavered between the categorical instances of identifying as nonbinary vs. gender nonconforming?

Does anyone or did anyone ID as a gender nonconforming cis person? And for the latter, what was the process of relinquishing the ""cis"" part of that identity and claiming a new identity, presumably nonbinary?

What is the relationship or equivalence you see between people who ID as gender nonconforming or nonbinary or both?

Also, are there any communities I can follow where more people might share my experiences/thoughts?",genderqueer,"Not struggling per se, but I wanna talk about my personal gender identity.",1590530915.0,"{'created_utc': 1590505715, 'id': 'gqyrt2', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ' \n\nI, an AFAB person, feel less cis-ish than most cis women (I think).

I\'m opposed to being called things like ""lady"", ""beautiful"" when used as a noun, and any pet name--but that could just be an overall opposition to cis men\'s creepiness.\n\nSome questions to promote discussion --&gt; \n\nHas anyone here ever wavered between the categorical instances of identifying as nonbinary vs. gender nonconforming?\n\nDoes anyone or did anyone ID as a gender nonconforming cis person? And for the latter, what was the process of relinquishing the ""cis"" part of that identity and claiming a new identity, presumably nonbinary?\n\nWhat is the relationship or equivalence you see between people who ID as gender nonconforming or nonbinary or both?\n\nAlso, are there any communities I can follow where more people might share my experiences/thoughts?', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Not struggling per se, but I wanna talk about my personal gender identity.', 'created': 1590530915.0}"

So basically, I've never really taken any time to actually think about gender as a whole until recently, I had multiple conversations with my partner and he asked me if there might be a reason why I get myself so confused over it.   
The thing is, I found it a bit weird that he can so easily say he knows he's male cis, now I don't have any issue with this but the only thing I could really say to him was I think of myself as an individual and for whatever reason don't like the idea of giving myself a gender title. I guess part of it might be a fear of being vulnerable (past history won't go into detail), but I'm in this, what my bf calls confusion, over it.

in the end I didn't do any of that and at some point I just kind of... stopped feeling the ""boy"" side of myself? stopped feeling the need to hide my boobs. no longer wondered about how nice it would be for someone to call me ""sir"" by accident. and just fully decided to stick with calling myself a cis girl and using she/her pronouns.

2020-05-30 20:52:31,gtlljv,6,1,"Hello, everyone. So for a long time, I've always felt a disconnect with the fact I am AFAB. When I was a toddler, I was usually referred to as ""an adorable boy"" by strangers at the supermarket or at parties and that always made me feel happy. As I got older, I continued to do things that are considered feminine and eventually liked them. I enjoy wearing skirts and dresses when I don't feel like wearing pants and I would describe my relationship with makeup and nail polish as just enjoying it now and then. 

However, I also usually feel most comfortable when I bind my breasts and when I wear men's clothing. Most of my sexual dreams -- I lean more towards the asexual side because I rarely feel any sexual attraction to anyone -- involve gay sex. When I have packed, I feel this sense of joy that I don't feel usually. I saw a therapist who told me I was a trans man and had me start testosterone, but I realized I (a) do not want body hair, (b) did not enjoy the societal expectations placed on me as a man, and (c) was afraid of losing my prominent cheekbones while on HRT. I also found I became horny while on HRT, which made me distraught because I'm so used to feeling no sexual attraction and little arousal. As a result, I stopped HRT dosages and figured that coupled with how I feel about skirts/dresses and makeup meant I'm not a trans man. 

After some time and thought, I realized I'm somewhere likely as non-binary. I even explain with my pronouns (they/them) that it feels appropriate because I feel like my identity is bigger than the binary.

2020-05-30 21:05:07,gtltzs,0,1,"Hey! Honestly I don’t know why my questioning has gotten so bad over the past few weeks. Maybe it’s something to do with quarantine and stress. I’m afab. See I used to be very confident I was a trans guy, but now I’m just- confused. What threw me off is don’t want to take steps to physically transition. Presenting too masculine just doesn’t feel like me, and I wouldn’t enjoy the effects of testosterone- it would make me uncomfortable. Being seen as a man also makes me uncomfortable because of society’s expectations of men. Even as a trans guy I don’t see myself as a man, only as a boy. I am not “manly” nor am I ever the “man” in any relationship I’m in. Being assumed so or forced to be also makes me very uncomfortable. 

Okay. So you’d assume I’m just a feminine boy who doesn’t like being held to a manly standard. The problem is recently my boyfriends family (who I am not out to) referred to me as his “girl” and for some reason I found myself liking that. Which completely threw me for a loop.

I love being treated as female in some ways, especially by my boyfriends family, in terms of being treated more gently and being seen as kind and nurturing and in need of being protected and just in general being seen as more of myself and my feminine personality. But “woman” doesn’t feel 100% correct either. It also makes me uncomfortable in some ways. For some reason I really enjoy being called a girl, though- maybe it’s because I’m only still a teenager?

Okay. So I’ve been trying out trying to see myself as a girl. But the problem is I can never imagine asking my current friends and boyfriend to call me she/her or “girlfriend” because I don’t feel unattached to he/him pronouns, in fact I like both. 

Being seen as a woman makes me uncomfortable because for some reason I feel sexualized. When I identify as a girl it feels like everything I do isn’t my own. I feel like I’m showing off for other people and people are going to see me as an object and not as me. What’s even more complicated, I am still extremely dysphoric about my chest. I hate the thought of anyone ever focusing on that part of me or touching it. Although I don’t mind my chest too much as part of my body, what society views it and makes it out to be makes me extremely uncomfortable and so even when trying to identify as a girl I bind. But I feel like I shouldn’t if I was “really a girl”.

What should I do? What am I? I want to be a girl and be treated as one but I love my current pronouns and couldn’t imagine the people close to me calling me anything else but a boy- because they don’t hold me to the standards of one. I couldn’t imagine them changing anything in the way they address me because I do enjoy hearing he/him and boyfriend. But on the flip side, I definitely don’t mind the people who already know me as female calling me a girl- because I know they won’t sexualize me for it. 

I hate the thought of anyone ever focusing on or touching my chest. But if I identify as a girl, anyone who is interested in girls is going to be thrown off by the fact I absolutely hate having my chest touched or seen by anyone. My current boyfriend is okay with it and understands because he is trans and feels the same way about his chest, but what if something happens between us? How am I going to find someone as accepting of the fact I don’t like being touched there?

How can I be comfortable with being treated like a girl and called a girl but also enjoy being called a boy by some people at the same time? How can I be okay with being called both but be uncomfortable with choosing only one thing to be called? I need to be called both to be comfortable with myself, but want to be called he by some people and she by some people— yet always be treated “like a girl”. I just desperately want to be seen as myself. But I don’t know what label that would be, and how to find other people like me or that would want me— because I feel like a mess.

How am I going to find someone as accepting of the fact I don’t like being touched there?\n\nHow can I be comfortable with being treated like a girl and called a girl but also enjoy being called a boy by some people at the same time? How can I be okay with being called both but be uncomfortable with choosing only one thing to be called? I need to be called both to be comfortable with myself, but want to be called he by some people and she by some people— yet always be treated “like a girl”. I just desperately want to be seen as myself. But I don’t know what label that would be, and how to find other people like me or that would want me— because I feel like a mess. I’m sorry if this rant makes little to no sense or is contradictory at points but it’s how I feel at the moment and I hope someone else can relate.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'I’m not sure what I am', 'created': 1590897907.0}"

I’ve been identifying as non-binary for a couple months and it feels right, and I used demigirl as well but that doesn’t feel right. I think besides being non-binary I’m gender fluid or something I can quite seem to describe what I’m feeling. Some days I’ll feel really androgynous, other days I’ll feel masc or like a soft gay boy and really want to be a guy in a gay relationship, and other days, rarely I might feel a little fem, which especially happens when I’m on my period.

I grew up in a conservative family and there was no one in my life I could really talk to about issues like silexuaoity or gender. I'm not sure which appropriate subreddit to bring up a subject like this but if you know a better one other than this, please feel free to suggest it. 
But basically, I completely recognize that I'm female although most of the time I feel like I should not be female. I'm not wishing to be another gender but most of the time I just feel like I'm not completely male and I'm not completely female either, its always a mix. It's just been something that I've learned to live with and never bought up with anybody. So it's like every day I look in the mirror I'll never just look at a single person, some days I look like a woman and other days like a pretty boy with long hair lol. 
This might not be related but body wise, I'm short, I've got a small face, broad shoulders, square hips, I'm a but hairier than most females, and the sound of my voice is a but more androgynous. And I've got an Adams apple lol so I guess in a way, I think I look like a mix between the two. 
I was just wondering if anybody here may know a specific or certain word to describe what in feeling like intersex? Transexual? I'm not very sure. It would be nice to know. Thanks :)
Edit: a lot of times I though, okay maybe I'm just a tomboy?
