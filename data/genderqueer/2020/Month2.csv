I came out to my closest friends recently after a long time wrestling with my gender expression. My whole life has felt like a tug-of-war between the soft butch style I now employ and a very femme style.

I think I was kind of taught growing up that, in women, attractiveness can’t exist without femininity, and it was only recently that I realized I can dress how I’m more comfortable and still feel attractive asf. Now, I often do.

But this is what’s weird - I still, like, wish I was femme. I just look at pictures of all these beautiful femmes and wish I was more like that, but I just know I’m not, and I know when I make myself look more femme that I just feel weird, weird, weird.

As a kid there were many times when I'd wondered why I didn't get to choose my sex, and thought it would have been better if I was born a girl. Early on I definitely believed in reincarnation, and I remember hoping that next time I'd come back as a girl, so I could experience both sides of things.

So when I learned about what being transgender was, I had to give some serious thought to my own gender identity. However I kept hearing this idea of gender dysphoria, and that transgender people felt discomfort due to their biological sex. That's where I was left scratching my head: I didn't feel that. I didn't feel bad about my current identity as a male, I just felt good about identifying as female.

Over time and through exploration with accepting friends and partners, my understanding of my identity has evolved, and I've come to the conclusion that I seem to have two distinct gender identities. It's like I'm two people sharing one body. I don't feel like a man who also has a female side, or a woman who also has a male side - I feel like a man and a woman, sharing a body. 

The two identities have distinct names (for the sake of anonymity, I'll just call them Mister and Miss though). Mister prefers male pronouns like he/him. Miss prefers female pronouns like she/her. 

They have distinct romantic and sexual preferences. Both are pansexual, but Mister is heteroromantic, while Miss is panromantic. Mister is a switch, while Miss is exclusively a sub or vanilla. Miss is pickier about female presenting sexual partners, while Mister is pickier about male presenting ones.

They have some differences in hobbies, and interests. 

They also have very different ideas of body image. Mister's ideal body image is quite masculine, short dark hair, a full beard, muscular, typical male clothing, etc. While for Miss, it's almost the complete opposite: long light hair, slim build, skirts/dresses etc. 

Neither identity really wants to be androgynous, and so I'm forced to pick one or the other. Of the two, I'd probably prefer to present female, but given that I was born male, live in a place that's notoriously anti-LGBTQ and bigoted, and since I don't experience gender dysphoria, I instead present as Mister's ideal body image.

Now that my vent is over. I have so many questions. 

Firstly, is this normal? Do others here feel this way, like their gender identities are distinct separate people? 

I'd also like to know. How do you deal with this in relationships? Particularly those of you who have different romantic/sexual preferences depending on which gender identity you currently identify with.

I’m a non-binary AFAB, and feel comfortable wearing menswear and having an androgynous haircut, EXCEPT I don’t always know how to express my sexuality when I do so. I see a distinction between who has power in a sexual dynamic verses who penetrates or receives, and I definitely love running the show while being penetrated / worshiped / being the center of attention (i.e. total power bottom).  But I feel like that distinction isn’t often made by others — doing the penetrating is generally conflated with being in control and with masculinity, while being penetrated and relinquishing control are conflated with femininity. I definitely pull those elements apart into separate concepts and DON’T bucket them all together, and I want other people to understand that about me too! But how? I feel like if I dress too masculine people will think I want to wear the dildo (which I usually don’t) but if I dress too feminine people will think I’m submissive (I’m still not that either!) Wat do! Is this just part of the journey? Does anyone else relate?

Side tangent, sex with men or butch women sometimes feels dysphoric if, while receiving penetration, I start to view myself in the stereotypical “submissive female” role.  Similarly, wearing a strap-on and going to town on someone, or being expected to always top and call all the shots in a relationship with a woman makes me feel icky too.  I’m still figuring out how to negotiate this — fucking other enbies or androgynous-leaning people is one way to circumvent the issue and maybe that’s my answer?

2020-02-17 09:58:06,f56lad,0,1,"I just joined and feel encouraged by reading about some experiences I can relate to. I’m 35, AFAB, asexual and while I’ve been aware of the term genderqueer for years, I just recently began questioning whether it might pertain to me. 

I’m person who presents more or less as a feminine woman these days but who doesn’t always feel like one. The reason I’ve started to explore my gender identity lately is because of the discrepancy between the way I feel and the way that people treat me. I’ve always been comfortable just being myself without necessarily having to conceptualize my experience of gender but the way I present can confuse people and I have found myself feeling compelled to find a way of communicating about my experience. 

Since I was young I’ve had both masculine and feminine interests and proclivities and am comfortable having a range of appearances from feminine to masculine to androgynous. My breasts are on the larger side (making it harder to pull off masculine and androgynous looks) and I think people have felt put off by me not wearing a bra or wearing a messenger bag with the strap smooshing my breast. For the most part I don’t think of my breasts or experience them as anything feminine (even if I’m presenting in a feminine way at the moment). I’ve had anywhere from long hair to a fauxhawk to a shaved head over the years, currently long hair.

These days I pretty much present as feminine. This has led to frustration on my part when other women were put off by my sometimes masculine ways of sitting or told me, “See, you look pretty when you wear a dress” on the occasions that I would wear one (heavy third eye roll). 

I’ve never experienced gender dysphoria and am happy w/ my body parts. I’m also comfortable with my experience of gender but it often leads me to feel like I don’t fit in socially. I often feel awkward around women, like I can’t relate. I wish the men I relate to could see me as more like them - sometimes I want to have a beer or work on a construction project together or shoot the shit in a chill, non-toxic-masculinity kind of way. At the same time I sometimes feel feminine when I wear a cute outfit or am feeling nurturing and that’s a part of myself that I value equally to my masculine side. As a POC who grew up within my sheltered community in a rural, conservative town with no real model for how someone who experiences what I do would look and act, I got used to sticking by myself. Being a romantic asexual / demisexual and not realizing it until the age of 35 on top of it all has moreso made gender and sexuality kind of a grey, amorphous area of my life experience that I just ignored for many years but this isn’t something I’m willing to do anymore. I’ve been primarily attracted to cis het men my whole life but they don’t seem to return the sentiment except for the ones that bring out my feminine side.

I’m 35, AFAB, asexual and while I’ve been aware of the term genderqueer for years, I just recently began questioning whether it might pertain to me. \n\nI’m person who presents more or less as a feminine woman these days but who doesn’t always feel like one. The reason I’ve started to explore my gender identity lately is because of the discrepancy between the way I feel and the way that people treat me. I’ve always been comfortable just being myself without necessarily having to conceptualize my experience of gender but the way I present can confuse people and I have found myself feeling compelled to find a way of communicating about my experience. \n\nSince I was young I’ve had both masculine and feminine interests and proclivities and am comfortable having a range of appearances from feminine to masculine to androgynous. My breasts are on the larger side (making it harder to pull off masculine and androgynous looks) and I think people have felt put off by me not wearing a bra or wearing a messenger bag with the strap smooshing my breast. For the most part I don’t think of my breasts or experience them as anything feminine (even if I’m presenting in a feminine way at the moment). I’ve had anywhere from long hair to a fauxhawk to a shaved head over the years, currently long hair.\n\nThese days I pretty much present as feminine. This has led to frustration on my part when other women were put off by my sometimes masculine ways of sitting or told me, “See, you look pretty when you wear a dress” on the occasions that I would wear one (heavy third eye roll). \n\nI’ve never experienced gender dysphoria and am happy w/ my body parts. I’m also comfortable with my experience of gender but it often leads me to feel like I don’t fit in socially. I often feel awkward around women, like I can’t relate. I wish the men I relate to could see me as more like them - sometimes I want to have a beer or work on a construction project together or shoot the shit in a chill, non-toxic-masculinity kind of way. At the same time I sometimes feel feminine when I wear a cute outfit or am feeling nurturing and that’s a part of myself that I value equally to my masculine side. As a POC who grew up within my sheltered community in a rural, conservative town with no real model for how someone who experiences what I do would look and act, I got used to sticking by myself. Being a romantic asexual / demisexual and not realizing it until the age of 35 on top of it all has moreso made gender and sexuality kind of a grey, amorphous area of my life experience that I just ignored for many years but this isn’t something I’m willing to do anymore. I’ve been primarily attracted to cis het men my whole life but they don’t seem to return the sentiment except for the ones that bring out my feminine side.

2020-02-24 04:29:57,f8ltxk,5,1,"Hey all, new poster here.

I’m pretty new to the genderqueer scene and am still trying to find my true identity. I’m AFAB and the only real thing I know is that I’m not a girl or a guy, but I lean masculine. Im leaning towards demigender/demiman but I’m still working things through and therefore I’m only out to my friends and people I trust.

Anyway, I’ve always hated myself without any reason. I’ve never liked the way I looked and always strove to be more and more feminine because I was convinced that was the problem. I never felt like I was enough and shifted through personalities/styles rapidly. Turns out, i was exploring the wrong gender.

Since accepting that I’m not cis, I’ve become more confident. I’ve always had mental health issues, and recently I’ve felt less hopeless. I actually look forward to things now. I don’t know what the end of this journey will be, but there’s something so satisfying about being me.

And then, I was talking to my mom about a male interest I have. I mentioned that we’re just friends and, as a joke, said “yeah we’re just dudes being bros.” And she immediately interferes with “you shouldn’t refer to yourself as dude. He might get the wrong idea.”

My mom knows I’m bi, and recently I’ve clearly been presenting masculine. She hasn’t said anything, but this kinda let me see exactly how she feels about my new appearance. It hurt. She didn’t know what she was saying, she didn’t mean it like that, but it just hurt. It definitely confirmed that I’m not comfortable being identified as female.

I know that many of you have had similar and worse experiences, so I guess I just wanted to share my thoughts and feelings with a community that understands. I don’t plan on coming out to my mom any time soon, and definitely not until I’ve settled on an identity. If anyone has any advice about not being hurt by careless remarks while still in the closet, I’d like to hear it.

She/her pronouns, being separated by gender, being called a woman/female to my face, etc. Makes me feel sick to my stomach and a little mad. He/him and they/them pronouns feel pretty neutral to me. 

I usually wear clothing you might imagine a flamboyantlg gay dude might wear, but when I dress up, I usually do so in a very feminine way. When I do dress in that feminine way, I feel good about myself, but usually change soon after when I've had too much of feeling like the people around me are viewing me as feminine. 

I think some part of me feels like if I'm afab, look feminine, like having long hair, and wear dresses when I go to a big party, it would be silly of me to ask people to think of me as anything but feminine. Also, the people who have known me for a long time don't see me as feminine despite those things - and even though I haven't said any of this to most of them - just because they know me. 

Why correct people if all it does is make people look at me weird when I could have just let them look at me in a way that makes me sick?

I've had a buzz cut for a long time for health reasons, and I used to feel the need to overcompensate to make the rest of my appearance more feminine, wearing makeup, skirts, etc. But for the last year or so, I've been skipping the dresses and makeup and just wearing leggings or pants.
