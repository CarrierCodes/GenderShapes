I'm completely new to reddit, as I actually just made an account to ask this question. So go easy on me :)

I'm currently working on a research project within the field of obstetrics, which is already VERY gendered. I realize that this may be difficult for trans and non-binary/non-gender conforming people who are pregnant. So I really want to try and make my paper (which will hopefully be published within the next year) gender-inclusive. I've been reading some articles which suggest using the term ""pregnant people"" rather than ""pregnant women"", which I have incorporated into my writing. However, I am facing some difficulties with replacing the words ""sister"" and ""mother"" as well as ""maternal"" in the contexts where they are referring to medical history (e.g. the participant was asked if their mother or sister had a history of X illness), as replacing these words with ""parent"" and ""sibling"" would make the statements inaccurate. 

I also realize that the topic of gender in relation to childbirth is probably much more complex than what I currently am aware of.

First of all, I hope I am posting this in a correct sub. I also asked this in r/nonbinary. 

So this isn’t for me. I (23 F) am raising my 13 y.o. sister. I am trying to be a good faux parent. Recently....like yesterday..... my sister came out to be as nonbinary. Now, this isn’t super shocking. About a year ago she came out as bi and since then she’s been wearing mostly “men’s” clothing. 
Now I love her and make sure she knows that she is supported and that I will always be there for her. But she said she wanted to start wearing a chest binder because hers is quite large and it makes her super uncomfortable. As a cis female, I know nothing about this and am looking for a place to start. 
Should I have her start to wear sports bras to ease into it? Are there certain ones that are better? I know that if they are not worn correctly they can affect breathing.

2020-06-06 21:36:50,gxzju2,0,1,"Kia Ora, sorry if y’all are sick of seeing these kinds of posts. I’d just like to see if anyone can identify with my gender story and if anyone has advice for me.

I’ve never been very good at being a girl. I’ve always expressed androgynously and been very gnc even as a child. I always played with boys throughout primary (elementary) school, I never got my ears pierced, I always hated makeup. I’m even biologically not very good at being a girl - my menstruation has always been sparse and erratic so every period feels like my first, my breasts never really grew in, and I have a deeper voice than the majority of girls. These factors all make me a very strange woman in the eyes of society, and they also have always stopped me from identifying with women. Being in all-girl groups makes me feel like an alien, and being referred to as she or with my feminine birth name feels like a clash.

For a few years I repressed any gender questioning and was a TERF, because in my head if there was no gender and only two sexes, that was the best way to exist as a woman. I’ve now seen the light lol, but that also means I’ve been questioning my gender a lot.

Basically, I’m not sure if I’m genderqueer, or if I just need to come to terms with being a gnc woman. Of course I believe that anybody can do whatever the hell they want and they’re valid, but I can’t escape the feeling of being ‘wrong.’ If anyone understands this it would be great to hear from you, especially if you’re secure in your gender identity (whether that is trans, nb, or cis).

I'm AFAB nonbinary, and I started out still being comfortable with presenting femme. With the progression of time though, I now find myself being uncomfortable with almost anything relating to femininity. It's actually kind of upsetting to me, because I feel like some of it is internalized misogyny, and there are still a lot of things typically associated with femininity that I still feel close to.

I know that I should be my authentic self, but sometimes it feels like if I try to assert my status as not male or female, I just kind of get stepped on because people don't understand it, so they just revert to whatever they assume I am, which is usually female. It feels like right now I want to be literally anything other than my assigned gender, but that in order to feel validated, I have to be as far away from that as I possibly can, which I don't think is really me. I know I will always identify as nonbinary, but right now I feel comfortable just being referred to as male. At the same time, I keep feeling this guilt like I'm not valid for that though, because I'm ""hiding"" who I am or that it's just a cover to feel more acceptable to society.

I\'m scared that the only reason I want to present more masculine now is because it\'s the only way I\'ll be taken seriously. \n\nI know that I should be my authentic self, but sometimes it feels like if I try to assert my status as not male or female, I just kind of get stepped on because people don\'t understand it, so they just revert to whatever they assume I am, which is usually female. It feels like right now I want to be literally anything other than my assigned gender, but that in order to feel validated, I have to be as far away from that as I possibly can, which I don\'t think is really me. I know I will always identify as nonbinary, but right now I feel comfortable just being referred to as male. At the same time, I keep feeling this guilt like I\'m not valid for that though, because I\'m ""hiding"" who I am or that it\'s just a cover to feel more acceptable to society. It just feels like no matter what I do it\'s an act. It feels so good to be referred to anything as female right now, but I feel like I\'m wrong for experiencing gender in that way.\n\nDoes anyone else ever grapple with this? I know every person\'s experience is going to be 100% unique to them, but I\'m curious on how other people have dealt with this.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Resentment of birth gender', 'created': 1592178732.0}"

2020-06-15 01:22:07,h96554,5,2,"I’ll apologize for the novel that lies below. I’ve been a little reflective lately about some things, and today someone I follow on Instagram came out as genderqueer and double checking the definition so I knew exactly what she was describing, got me reflecting some more. 

So I’m a guy— a male— a he/him. I’m in my early 30s and am married. I’ve kind of taken to thinking of myself as asexual as I don’t have much if any sex drive, although I do consider women attractive. 

So probably ever since I was a kid, I’ve been interested in stories and things of guys becoming girls, my first experience with it was the anime Ranma 1/2, and to this day I still enjoy good stories of guys becoming female. Usually more per mystical effects rather than realistic methods like going through transition. 

At the end of my teens and into my early twenties, I write a webcomic that was fairly popular that followed the subject of what I wrote about before. A teenage boy being turned into a girl and then following their reluctance and eventual acceptance of their situation. I was always very reluctant and anxious to talk to people in person about it. ‘Hey, what’s that comic you wrote online?’ Oh— uh— it was...

I dabbled in a little bit of cross dressing in my late teens and through my twenties, I liked feminine clothes, and follow many female cosplayers and while yes I do think they are attractive and follow ones I think are attractive— I also watch them enviously thinking ‘damn It’d be awesome to be an attractive girl like that’. I’m fairly tall and masculine so the idea of cross dressing or being trans does not appeal to me. While I’d be interested in being an attractive female— the idea of looking very masculine ‘just trying to look like an ugly woman’ does not appeal to me. 

I do live in a very red county, and for probably 2/3 of my life been involved with Motorsports, which have a VERY alt right way of looking at things, and I always cringe seeing my Facebook light up with things against LGBT or BLM depending on which group is fighting for rights at that time. I am terrified of anyone I know fighting out about what I’ve written here. My wife is one of very few people I know in person who is even aware of my inclusion of the brony or furry communities. Another is actually from the race track and is actually apparently a well known brony. That was a surprise for me when I saw that guy pop up on a tv show which was showing a brony convention. 

When playing games, I want to play female characters. My main characters in world of Warcraft were almost all female. I played a few male characters, but they were my alts. In D&amp;D I kind of bounce back and forth between male and female characters, as I don’t want these people I know wonder why I’m playing so many female characters. My current character is actually a 10 inch tall little pixie girl. I love her and the other players find her absolutely adorable. Other players had already gone over the gender barrier so I felt it a little bit easier to bring her in, although it’s the first female PC they’ve seen me played. I get to have some other female characters as I DM another game. I’m perfectly comfortable playing a guy— it’s easy afterall since that’s who I am. However if I get opportunities I definitely would pick to play the female characters over males.

I’m not uncomfortable with my gender. I don’t think of myself in a way that I can’t stand being a male, that this isn’t who I am. Nope, it’s totally who I am. However— if I found a magic lamp and a genie came out, or some serum was invented, that’d allow me to become a girl, I’d definitely be interested in doing it. I’ve also recently had some dreams lately, probably spurred on my some of the things I’ve been thinking about, which has my wife and I having swapped genders and us enjoying our new rolls. 

Ever since I’ve gotten Instagram I’ve followed cosplayers and some models and stuff and I think about how pretty they are, about how I’d love to try wearing some of the things they wear. But I know I’m a guy and I’ll never be able to wear any of that stuff. Even if I opted to get some of those clothes and wear them when no one is here, I’d definitely not look good in them and probably be ashamed of myself about it. The recent faceapp allows me to take some photos and do a pretty dang convincing gender swaps, I can’t tell you how many pictures I’ve got of female me on my phone now. 

A few years ago my older sibling came out trans. Born male, and I knew *him* for 30 years or so. I never really considered the idea of them being trans, even though they were the one who originally showed me Ranma. However combined with knowing them one way for like 30 years and then also not really presenting much as female, this looking more masculine than feminine, it’s been hard for me to really get into their chosen gender identity. A lot of times in texts with family I just use a first initial rather than using their new name. Even here I’ve opted for gender neutral pronouns instead of feminine as it’s been hard to view them as female. Them having falling into drug problems which overlapped with their coming out really caused me to struggle to support them as I’ve always been a staunch anti drug person. Even though I know realistically that dealing with the gender dysphoria is likely what lead them to the alcoholism and drugs, their inability to let family help them through multiple attempts to get them to rehab and watching them just ruin their previously successful career has caused a rift with them from the family. 

I’m fairly confident my wife would be accepting if I told her I was genderqueer or something. I’ve got no intention of ever wanting to do a transition or anything, so I’m not trans— I’m not really sure what I’d be classified as, I’m posting here because I’m curious what people part of the LGBTQ (yes I know there’s more letters now, but I don’t know them all) community who are more familiar with peoples different classifications would have to say about it. 

If you’ve read this far, bless you.

2020-06-15 12:38:10,h9fig8,3,1,"I'm technically cis female, but I've never felt completely ""right"" in my body. I don't wish to transition to a man, but if by magic I found myself with also a penis, that would be fine with me. I've never really told anyone this aside from my husband and even there I've kinda tried to open up, but not really? I don't think he really understands just HOW much of an issue I have with myself, or certain things considered ""feminine"". I'm honestly afraid to share more, because I don't think he really grasped just how much of an issue it can be for me. I know that's kinda my own fault at this point as I just ""let it be"".

I have NEVER liked my boobs. They are on the large side, and he likes them. I can't tell you how much I HATE wearing bras. The comments I have gotten from men in the past make me feel gross. Yeah, I don't like the stares/cat calls, but it's more than that. I do not like being looked at like that because I don't really feel feminine. It makes me uncomfortable. If it were up to me I'd just get them removed. I've thought about a breast reduction as a ""compromise"". I haven't talked to my husband about this, but I do believe it'd bother him if I just up and ""got rid"" of them. Which is fair enough. If they're small enough to not keep me from doing physical activities, I'd be able to ignore their existence so it doesn't feel like a big compromise on my part.

I also DESPISE the idea of being pregnant. I told him I wasn't sure I wanted kids before we got married (he does), but the truth is it's waaaaay more because I get grossed out by the idea of being pregnant, to the point I have had nightmares in the past. I also really hate the idea of being ""Mom"". Not parent, but ""Mom"". Idk, the whole thing makes me uncomfortable. I wish I could just have a kid, and not do the whole pregnant thing.

I also have a disconnect with some things seen as feminine. I almost never wear makeup, shaving is overrated, and I feel really weird wearing dresses/skirts. I've tried to force myself out of my comfort zone at times, as I think part of that is the way my Mom would talk about what women are ""supposed"" to be, which is the exact opposite of who, and what I want to be. I still have a vivid memory when I was a kid, and before puberty, taking off my shirt when I was playing in a sprinkler, as my male friend did. We lived next door to said friend and my Mom noticed, and was absolutely LIVID. She was PISSED, and told me in under no circumstances should women reveal themselves like that. I can on one hand understand her reasoning, but I also STILL feel the disconnect and I'm in my early 30s now. Boobs are so sexualized, and I feel completely disconnected from mine. They exist, get in the way, and I really wouldn't mind if they disappeared tomorrow.

When my husband and I were just friends, he tended to go for the ""typical feminine"" girls before we got in a relationship. Makeup, nice clothes, etc. Yet I feel like I fit almost none of that. We almost never have sex, and he seems to prefer to do the deed alone. I find myself wondering if it's because I'm not his usual ""type"". It's hard not to when it's really obvious he's once again went to porn, almost every day at this point. I've tried talking to him, but it doesn't really seem to change, and he admitted in therapy he tends to tune me out. I hate to admit it, but I've gotten so bitter, and brought it up in ways I am not so proud of. I feel like I am constantly completing with something I can never be, and I feel I am always on the losing end.

Idk how much of that is because of my own disconnect in my own body, vs what he's doing. I am a very sexual person, so it's REALLY starting to bother me. Part of me is almost considering bringing up me having casual sex with other people. A huge part of me really doesn't want that, as I wish HE would want me, but I've almost given up all hope of much of a sexual relationship with him at this point. I want to feel wanted, and I don't. I feel like my self-esteem is in the gutter. I am finding it really hard to not wish I was dead sometimes.

I feel at least part of it is my own fault for not laying everything on the table right at the start.

I\'ve never really told anyone this aside from my husband and even there I\'ve kinda tried to open up, but not really? I don\'t think he really understands just HOW much of an issue I have with myself, or certain things considered ""feminine"". I\'m honestly afraid to share more, because I don\'t think he really grasped just how much of an issue it can be for me. I know that\'s kinda my own fault at this point as I just ""let it be"".\n\nI have NEVER liked my boobs. They are on the large side, and he likes them. I can\'t tell you how much I HATE wearing bras. The comments I have gotten from men in the past make me feel gross. Yeah, I don\'t like the stares/cat calls, but it\'s more than that. I do not like being looked at like that because I don\'t really feel feminine. It makes me uncomfortable. If it were up to me I\'d just get them removed. I\'ve thought about a breast reduction as a ""compromise"". I haven\'t talked to my husband about this, but I do believe it\'d bother him if I just up and ""got rid"" of them. Which is fair enough. If they\'re small enough to not keep me from doing physical activities, I\'d be able to ignore their existence so it doesn\'t feel like a big compromise on my part.\n\nI also DESPISE the idea of being pregnant. I told him I wasn\'t sure I wanted kids before we got married (he does), but the truth is it\'s waaaaay more because I get grossed out by the idea of being pregnant, to the point I have had nightmares in the past. I also really hate the idea of being ""Mom"". Not parent, but ""Mom"". Idk, the whole thing makes me uncomfortable. I wish I could just have a kid, and not do the whole pregnant thing.\n\nI also have a disconnect with some things seen as feminine. I almost never wear makeup, shaving is overrated, and I feel really weird wearing dresses/skirts. I\'ve tried to force myself out of my comfort zone at times, as I think part of that is the way my Mom would talk about what women are ""supposed"" to be, which is the exact opposite of who, and what I want to be. I still have a vivid memory when I was a kid, and before puberty, taking off my shirt when I was playing in a sprinkler, as my male friend did. We lived next door to said friend and my Mom noticed, and was absolutely LIVID. She was PISSED, and told me in under no circumstances should women reveal themselves like that. I can on one hand understand her reasoning, but I also STILL feel the disconnect and I\'m in my early 30s now. Boobs are so sexualized, and I feel completely disconnected from mine. They exist, get in the way, and I really wouldn\'t mind if they disappeared tomorrow.\n\nWhen my husband and I were just friends, he tended to go for the ""typical feminine"" girls before we got in a relationship. Makeup, nice clothes, etc. Yet I feel like I fit almost none of that. We almost never have sex, and he seems to prefer to do the deed alone. I find myself wondering if it\'s because I\'m not his usual ""type"". It\'s hard not to when it\'s really obvious he\'s once again went to porn, almost every day at this point. I\'ve tried talking to him, but it doesn\'t really seem to change, and he admitted in therapy he tends to tune me out. I hate to admit it, but I\'ve gotten so bitter, and brought it up in ways I am not so proud of. I feel like I am constantly completing with something I can never be, and I feel I am always on the losing end.\n\nIdk how much of that is because of my own disconnect in my own body, vs what he\'s doing. I am a very sexual person, so it\'s REALLY starting to bother me. Part of me is almost considering bringing up me having casual sex with other people. A huge part of me really doesn\'t want that, as I wish HE would want me, but I\'ve almost given up all hope of much of a sexual relationship with him at this point. I want to feel wanted, and I don\'t. I feel like my self-esteem is in the gutter. I am finding it really hard to not wish I was dead sometimes.\n\nI feel at least part of it is my own fault for not laying everything on the table right at the start. I love him very much, but I don\'t want to live my entire life feeling unwanted, or scared to be 100% of who I am.

2020-06-21 05:44:58,hd1m2m,0,1,"So... I'm a male, in that that is what it says on my ID card and that I can, and have passed as cis and het since ever. But its a skin that I've never really worn... correctly,  I guess? By way of metaphor, I have always felt I've worn and ill fitting suit of a man. Never quite comfortable, arms are too short and binds in the nether regions. But I wore it none the less. Whether out of fear of ostracization, or simply that is was the option that maximized self preservation, I learned to wear it well.

I remember when my sister and I were little, around six or so, she would demand we play house. I would put up a fuss, or cut deals, and make a show of disinterest. But, it would be a lie to say there wasn't some part of me that enjoyed the 'girls game'. So she would assign her role as the baby, and me the parent. I'd often choose the role of the mother. 

We were a single parent household. Our father a scum bag... maybe in some way it allowed me to feel the lack of maternal influence that caused me so much grief in my early life... hell, in some ways I still feel the scars 30 years later.

I remember being that age, when you cant quite tell if a child is a boy or girl. I was asked a number of times... I protested, asserting juvenile masculinity. As I grew older, I missed the question. 

I've always known that I never quite fit the molds that so many seemed to have been created with. I assumed I was a pot made to be broken. I've always had some strange fascination with people who didn't quite fit the mold. Girls that were a little like boys, and boys that were a little like girls. Maybe it was something in me that I was searching for in them. 

I learned about sex to young. I thought, for years, some of my fascinations were just fetishistic aberration. For a long time I was ashamed, occasionally sickened. But eventually came to understand that shame was unneeded...  I still hide though. Then I considered that I might be trans... but that didn't fit. I read the accounts of dysphoria and found their severity absent in me. And I don't want to be a woman...nor a man. I want to be me.

Transhumanism and science fiction lead me further. Evolving my conception of gender, among other things. In an ideal world, I suppose I would be light. Starlight traveling at impossible speeds sailing through a strand of glass or plastic, dipping and shifting and morphing to fit what ever whim or impulse took my fancy. Or the fancy of someone I fancied. 

RPG's helped. Allowed me to alter my conception of self, if only for a time, and shape it to fit what ever story I had in mind. But I found, the more stories I told, the more the kept falling upon a central theme. A person trying to find and be themselves. A declaration. ""I am.""

I am... disquieted. Not who I am. Born into the wrong skin, or wrong century. I am what I was made into. A pot made to be broken... an aberration. Maybe it is all spawn from a lonely childhood. Or a lack of a maternal role model. Or some sick fetish...

Or maybe the fetish helps me feel part of myself. Like I'm connected to my body, not only some passive observer in an ill fitting meat suit. Or I'm attracted to attractive things, and things which share a similarity to me. A touch narcissistic perhaps, but normal... God, what I would give to shed this skin and be that which I am...

Maybe I'm just repressed. Psychically constipated... or just full of shit.

Its stupid, I know. My partner is nonbinary. And if I told her all or any of this she would welcome me with open arms, I know... But still, I can hardly say a word of it. I'm afraid to be what I am.

Why? I've always been one of those ""I don't care what no one thinks..."" sorts... an illusion. Apparently a convincing one if  I'm going to believe what other have told me I am... I wish I could convince myself. But even if I could...

Testosterone is a hell of a drug. Worse than meth... I have a hard time looking at myself in the mirror. Shaving is a bitch... But, every so often there is a glimmer of something else. A mirage of... beauty? A whisper of I am. Even if I could admit to it, it would be a hallow victory. Followed by a sigh of defeat. Im not clay. Or light. Or... 

I'm not I am. And never will be...

I'm sorry. This rant has gone on too long, half coherent rambling with a half baked point. I'm not even sure why here... I just needed to vent  I guess. Or hoping someone slaps me upside the head. Or spouts all that biological existentialist bullshit that I discarded long ago. Or maybe I just need someone to talk to under the veil of anonymity.

So I consider myself something of a ""male-adjacent"" non-binary, meaning I present relatively masculinely and identify with masculinity to an extent, but overall I reject conventional gender norms and identify with how I feel based on the particular day. I use they/them pronouns and consider myself largely gender-neutral.

But enough about me, on to my current issue: I work at a pizza store that's pretty diverse, people tend to be nice and easy going, but political discussions tend to hang on the conservative side.

Everyone but my brother (whom I'm out to and works at the store with me) use he/him exclusively, which doesn't exactly ruin my day per se, but it is pretty annoying. Folks associate me strictly with masculinity and manhood. 

I guess my problem is that I feel like I'm limiting myself by not being out to people that I see almost all the time?

- I don't experience dysphoria of any kind

- I feel perfectly comfortable with she/her pronouns. Matter of fact I would feel comfortable with literally any pronoun.

- I don't want to be ""hopping on the bandwagon"" of gender stuff, so to speak.

- Changing my gender identity would be a very inconvenient, uncomfortable process for me and the people around me.

That being said. I would feel much more powerful with they/them pronouns, thinking about it gives me this warm feeling in my chest.

That's a confusing and terrifying prospect for many reasons. Also, I thought you needed dysphoria for that? Or at the very least discomfort with your assigned gender, which I only have the regular amount of. But I have finally begun to aknowledge that it's at least a possibility.

I've never let myself question my gender before earlier this week because of the aforementioned comfort with my body and pronouns, so now I'm trying to figure out how I feel about myself at all. I know a few things:  
1. I am a girl  
2. I am not a boy  
3. I'm not only a girl

Even if I don't end up using a specific label, maybe I'll get a pretty flag to buy merch for. Who knows.

I mulled over demigirl for a couple days, and honestly...I hate it. I don't know exactly what it is, but something about calling myself a demigirl just makes me uncomfortable.

I feel inside a man, and in my inner world and fantasy I am a man, I identify with male characters and so on... as long as the outside world is not involved I have no trouble being a man. By that I mean an androgynous man, a man who is freely effeminate, with long hair, a masculine voice, a flat chest and no extra focus on private parts. Basically a neuter-man with no emphasis on macho-hood but a he.

The biggest problem is that I see a man in the mirror. People says they see a woman and this trigger a crisis: I'm not, why they can't see? I truly see a guy in the mirror, exactly as I am. Ok, I ignore some female-like shapes, but I want to get rid of that. The other problem? I don't want to go the medical route, no hormones or surgeries. I weighted pros and cons and how I feel deep down, and I'm sure I don't want it. 

The only reason to be biologically male would be to have the lovers I dream of, because I like men and I get shunned as the ""lonely lesbian who is here by mistake"" at gay events. But I can't have that body in a safe, functional way with no side effects so I have decided not to go the surgery/T way.

The other thing besides not wanting the medical transition is that I am not macho at all. If you want a pop-culture reference, think about Tolkien's Elves or K-pop androgynous artists. Long hair and everything. I want a supple lean body, more rhythmic gymnastics than judo (I did martial arts a lot, no bashing here).

Aaaand... I am jealous of some female clothes. Part of it is because I'm bickering with male clothes a lot: the top part looks oversized, the lower part has given me varicose veins due to constriction.

Probably the trousers feel better on my legs too, blood-circulation-wise. But that invalidates my gender a lot, I could pull off that or goth/emo makeup if I was on T or had surgeries, and I won't.

I've been questioning my gender since I entered high school back in 2017 when I was 14, and I was looking for some advice. Since January of 2019 (at age 16), I thought I was a trans man. It was not well-received by my parents, and one of them is actively trying to force me into living my life as a woman because of it. Lately, with the whole pandemic happening, I've been becoming accustomed to living with parents who don't accept me as a trans man. The frequent excuse for me not being able to be a man is either because I act too feminine or them assuming that I can't *possibly* understand my gender because I'm Autistic (when this is not the case).

Today, I woke up and thought about my gender. I've thought I was genderqueer once before, but it only lasted a week and was a result of similar transphobic shenanigans. However, I think that with being genderqueer, I am okay with my more feminine mannerisms while also still dressing more masculine (as much as possible). I still have a masculine name and pronouns that I chose for myself and would still like to be seen as a man, or at least not a woman.

Unfortunately I gained 10 kg that I am still trying to shed, so there is nothing that can make me look good really. I don't really like the dime-a-dozen sport's clothes look but that's what is comfortable with my shapes now... I look like a kid or a particularly sporty butch lesbian, and I am very unhappy with that. 

The point is that I also want a dainty ethereal look, like a refined elf or vampire or k-pop idol, something lithe. Yes, I need to lose weight. But I also missed something less aggressive, less ""construction worker"", something dainty and light so I thought that buying female clothes would be a good idea. Nothing girly, sports things, and underwear because the men's underpants have elastic bands that were creating a tourniquet on my hip joints that gave me varicose veins (I regret this hard). 

The result is that I am buying and throwing away cheap clothes for both sexes, and it's expensive given the turnaround. I am not comfortable with female underwear because I'm not a Barbie doll down there and I need the space allowed by male underwear, but there is the elastic band problem. I refuse to wear XL sizes, it's too humiliating and I also want something with as little fabric as possible.

I feel uncomfortable going around with nothing on and people stare, I'll do that when I'm flat-ish enough to do so, but everything I can wear screams ""you have boobs... woman"".

It's untenable, I have been here for 3 years and counting and there is 7 of us in just enough space. I have my own room but I have to hide my laundry to avoid showing male underwear etc. I'm going to go now that job-wise I can (deposit to be paid plus permanent contract).

However, I cannot afford anything in this city (I work here) unless is 25 sq mt in a dirty dangerous periphery with run down buildings, nothing else. So I think I'll move either in a 130k city that is 15 minutes by train or in one of the many 20k towns at the same distance by subway. 

My huge problem is the small-town mentality. I already feel terrified, like trying already to deny my gender identity or my passion for multiculturalism just to fit in in my future neighbourhood. I shouldn't give up on myself like this. I grew up in a 80k city where conservatism was rampant, 1 h from this big city. I hope that 130k and 15 min from the city will make for a better mentality, but the city has a reputation of rich-and-bigot inhabitants. 

The 20k towns are places where there is nothing, and I would like to avoid that. At least the 130k city has kung fu, bharatanatyam, ballet for adults and swimming like the big city. But... can I go there as a man, dancing male roles in male clothes or swimming in trunks plus top? I don't know. 

My best friend says that I will be closer to nature and make friends more easily (here is a fast paced stressful social-status place) but I wonder if I can make friends as my true self. And yet... here in the big city I have received shameful treatments in gyms, barber shops, hair salons, bad stares from children because of my trousers, things like that, and two forced attempts to make me transition medically against my will by employers. So, is it really better than a smaller city? 

On the other hand, my best friends assume that I will live outwardly as a ""woman"" and I'm not sure I can deal with that. Even if to be honest here in the city my all neighbours and flatmates have no idea about my gender identity, so what gives?

Then there is the difficulty of going to queer clubs, they are only here in the big city and I don't have a car. And yet... gay men at this clubs shun me as the ""lonely lesbian here by mistake"" instead of welcoming me as a fellow dude, so what is the point?

Through a discovery of me getting turned on by MtF (i believe girls with dicks is a appropriate term) i dove in to the terms.

I am biological a women but arent femine.. At least most of the  time.
I feel not like i am only onething a woman i feel more... dont know just more.
I can experience the feeling of a orgasm just by feeling/seeing my husband come, or read yaoi or watch gay porn not like turned on no i almost feel my spirit cock get turned on and come.

I am certain i do not wish to be a man, i am super happy with my body. 

One day i feel like wearing colberts and nice shirts (i always complain about me wanting the formal shirt  from men departement because they are more my style) the other time just androgynous clothing and sometimes i like pink dresses and lace.

I searched some terms but i am a bit confused what exactly the difference is with gender fluid, genderqueer and bigender.

I am guessing from what i read that bigender is soly identify as male and female while fluid and queer are more about all gender forms but whats the difference between those two then??

Also anybody reconize my story and can help me find my identity?

Hi friends and family, happy pride month!

Having done this before doesn't always make it easier, unfortunately. I made a realization about myself in the last few years that I would like to share with all of you. I am trans. Specifically, I identify as a genderqueer person. 

I have been living my life in this identity for a little while now, and the truth is that I am a happier, healthier person for it. I have become a harder worker, a better partner to my wife, and I don't think I would have been able to be the parent that I am without first learning to love and accept who I am. And in coming out I want to acknowledge that while I did come out to some folks personally, each time is just as difficult for me as the last. My intent was never to leave anyone in particular out of the loop until now.

""Oh wow, this is exciting news!"", you might say. To that I say thank you! I feel more like myself than I ever have.

""What does this mean?"", you might also say. Well for me it means a few things. I have more than one pronoun for example. I personally use any of these: he/him, they/them, and she/her. Any of those are completely appropriate to use when referring to me, regardless of what I am wearing. This also means for me that in time you may see me looking different on here. Sometimes I will look more masculine and what you are already familiar, sometimes I may appear more feminine, and sometimes it'll seem somewhere in between the two. Regardless of how I look, I am always the same person.

""Will this change our relationship?"", might cross your mind. Not at all! I am still the same person you know and love. Please just continue to be the same, loving people I know. I know who I am. And your love and kindness is all I need here. And if you have any genuine questions, please feel free to ask! Even though I am the one going through this, I still don't have all of the answers, but I will do my best. 

Thanks for being the awesome group of people that I am honored to call my family and friends. Again, reach out to me as necessary and I will be happy to try and answer your questions. My only request is that the questions remain respectful and to respect my boundaries if I feel it is too personal.

Much love,

I\'ve often seen things like ""you can\'t make trans people carry the burden for this"" but feel like that\'s also shrugging off the burden to GNC people.\n\nFor clarity: I don\'t have a problem calling people by whatever they want (I don\'t deadname and have no problem with changing pronouns etc etc though for political reasons I generally refer to everyone by \'they\' unless there\'s a particular reason I need to pick them out for their gender) and I don\'t have a problem with body modification (and I can understand the body dysphoria that drives it on a personal level) and I don\'t have any problem with people wanting to change how they present etc as they please. I just don\'t understand why we have to keep using the old language and stereotypes.\n\nI just really want to talk to some people who can help/are interested in this kind of thing/that can just spam me with socio-political reading to get my head straight.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Trying to untangle my thoughts on feminism, gender and sex.

2020-06-30 17:49:56,hisask,5,1,"Hey there, 

So I'm [32] fairly comfortable with male pronouns (assigned male at birth) and as a hairy dude that seems right. I present male, am openly bisexual and my fiancée is cis female (also bi, check us out hahah). 

I don't experience any dysphoria about the way I look, but I reject masculinity, I paint my nails frequently, I like having my hair in a plait, I'd like to play with makeup (but I worry about how people would react to me out and about... I know my fiancée wouldn't care... And then again, I barely go out, I'm a homebird) 

Most of the time I feel cis, but then again I frequently feel enby at the same time.

Is it possible to be cis and genderqueer? Am I non binary? 

Would appreciate any advice ʘ‿ʘ",genderqueer,Am I enby/genderqueer...
