Since childhood I’ve identified as a girl and felt very comfortable in my body. I like being a girl and doing things that make me feel feminine and pretty and I am definitely heterosexual. The thought of associating myself with a different gender never even crossed my mind... until today when I saw someone’s instagram bio say “she/they.” I am very uneducated about this stuff so I never knew you could use both pronouns, but I nearly had an epiphany when I read it. 

I remember starting in third grade I would want to wear “boy” clothes instead of traditional girls’ clothing. I’m 20 now and since then I’ve felt more comfortable dressing like a guy, talking in a deeper voice, and being around guys. I definitely get along better with guys than girls and I prefer to be friends with the “bruh girl” over the “girly girls” any day (I’m not sure how significant this is but just thought I’d throw this in there). I don’t have body dysmorphia or anything, but my face looks very androgynous, and I can look like a full blown male on some days depending on how I dress. I embrace all of these parts of myself and have no interest in looking or acting any more feminine than I already do. I also don’t really care to look or be called pretty/gorgeous or any of those adjectives that women typically get complimented. If I’m aiming to look good I just want to look good period. 

I definitely know that I am not meant to be fully male because I do enjoy and take pride in some parts of being female. I am attracted to males and love the idea of being in a male-female relationship.

But I guess I do seek attention because I feel very confused and illegitimate right now. So without further disclaimer, here is my story and why I needed to put it down in words.

I am AMAB and bigender. My male name is Ywan and my female name is Eowyn; I use only the latter on the Internet. I'm French and currently 22 years old. I'm not going into much detail here but you can browse [my website](https://eowyncwper.com/) to learn more about me.

# My dad

My dad used to be an awesome person. He made incredible choices for my life: I was homeschooled and the goal was for me to be myself. For the very large part, it succeeded. He also taught me open-mindedness and respect and I will always be grateful to him for all these things.

However, he was never much of a sociable man. In 2001, we moved out from our little town and went to live in an old house in the countryside. I was 3 so I grew up relatively isolated from society. But that's not the issue I want to discuss here, because it was to my father that this isolation did the most harm. He was fed up with the world when we moved out, and I recently realised that ever since 2001, his acceptance and respect for everything has been drastically diminishing.

Thus the Captain Fantastic who raised me and whom I admired is now a homophobic and transphobic man, overall full of hatred for the world. He's 64 and it won't do any good to try and change him; I've tried, it just ended up hurting me and I couldn't go on with that. I still live with my parents and don't worry, almost everything is going fine; you've got only the bad side here for the sake of conciseness.

# Me

While this is all not very enthusing, there is a bright side: I've started building myself outside of my dad's values for a couple years now. And most importantly for those who take the time to read what I have to say now, I've started questioning my gender identity in May 2019.

I was fully male then, and my goal was to get rid of all the bits of machismo my dad had transmitted to me. But I quickly ended up trying out feminine pronouns with close friends. And very soon after that, I entered my genderfluid phase. I didn't feel legit at all but it felt great nonetheless.

On February 27th of this year, I pushed the experience a step further and entered my trans phase. This is when I began using feminine pronouns on the Internet, everywhere and all the time. I was feeling more legit, but somehow it didn't feel as good as my genderfluid phase. I had no body or voice dysphoria. I know it's possible to be trans and have none, but it did not fit in. It felt like right in between genderfluid and trans. I was not on the right track.

Then I “found out” about being bigender. I had known what it was for a while but it took some time for it to feel right when applied to me. And so, on July 27th, I began identifying as bigender. I had never felt so legit and good about myself.

My experience of being bigender has been very comfortable thus far. Ever since February, I'm female on the Internet and male IRL. You cannot misgender me. I don't need to come out to anyone IRL, most importantly to my parents, because I'm fine with my masculine identity and mentioning the *other* would be upsetting for literally no benefits. Some fluidity is involved so I wish I could switch any pronouns on and off, and while I know I can, I don't feel confident to ask because… well, my gender identity never hurts me. Or, at least, never did until yesterday, October 2nd.

# How my separate identities met

I am a mapmaker (if you want to know what that is, there's still the link to my website). On August 1st, I got a commission from a writer. Let's call him S. (surely you can find out who he is in a couple minutes if you know where to click but I don't mean to advertise or embarrass either of us). I had been recommended to him by another mapmaker who assumed I was female (and of course she was right), so S. assumed so as well.

S. and I talked through emails throughout our collab, so everything was fine. Unlike French, my native language, English doesn't have gender agreements on verbs, nouns and adjectives, so my gender identity wasn't involved as we exchanged messages, and I didn't even have to know that I was female to him. But of course, there are pronouns. And of course, once the map was done and integrated to the books, I wanted to get copies of them for myself. So I ordered the books. And yesterday I've received them.

Here's [a photo](https://snipboard.io/lRqY1A.jpg) of how S. credited me.

If you recall that I'm AMAB, that I live with my parents and that I didn't come out to them, you can guess the part that comes next: why was I credited as female? I explained that he “assumed”, English grammar not having written gender agreements etc., although not implying that he had assumed *wrong*, nor what he might have assumed it from. In the inside, I was exulting. But it didn't last for long. My two gender identities had met and I was thrown into introspection again.

Coincidentally, last weekend, my girlfriend (LDR) told her parents that she had a girlfriend of her own (meaning me). So within a week, my feminine identity seeped into the “real world” twice. I had emotionally managed it the first time, but the books were the straw that broke the camel's back.

# Why I needed to put it in words

I know I'm genderqueer. I have thought it over long enough that that is a certainty. Also, being bigender has felt so right that I still think it defines me pretty well.

Yet, it practically made me lie to my parents about my gender identity. They barely know what gender identity means and my dad is too dramatically left behind compared to social progress to understand it anymore.

I've had a lot of anxiety lately, sometimes thinking things like “why do I bother, being male is easier”. Which… it would be, if it were the least bit applicable to me. But it is not.

At first, I sought some comfort in the late r/bigender subreddit, but everybody looked so androgynous on their photos it made me feel worse. I like how I look, and I look definitely male. And I know these are plain legitimacy issues that I have all the reasons in the world to dismiss, because I'm allowed to feel how I feel and to be myself. But for the first time in months, I don't know what I am anymore, because two identities that I kept separate suddenly met and it shook me.

Thank you for reading this. It helped me organise my thoughts a bit, but I'm craving for advice too. If any of you have had similar experiences or if you think you know something that relates to what I have to overcome right now, please do share. :)",genderqueer,Why yesterday was important for my bigender identity,1601761189.0,"{'created_utc': 1601735989, 'id': 'j4g3v6', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""Hello everybody.

I had no body or voice dysphoria. I know it's possible to be trans and have none, but it did not fit in. It felt like right in between genderfluid and trans. I was not on the right track.\n\nThen I “found out” about being bigender. I had known what it was for a while but it took some time for it to feel right when applied to me. And so, on July 27th, I began identifying as bigender. I had never felt so legit and good about myself.\n\nMy experience of being bigender has been very comfortable thus far. Ever since February, I'm female on the Internet and male IRL. You cannot misgender me. I don't need to come out to anyone IRL, most importantly to my parents, because I'm fine with my masculine identity and mentioning the *other* would be upsetting for literally no benefits. Some fluidity is involved so I wish I could switch any pronouns on and off, and while I know I can, I don't feel confident to ask because… well, my gender identity never hurts me. Or, at least, never did until yesterday, October 2nd.\n\n# How my separate identities met\n\nI am a mapmaker (if you want to know what that is, there's still the link to my website). On August 1st, I got a commission from a writer. Let's call him S. (surely you can find out who he is in a couple minutes if you know where to click but I don't mean to advertise or embarrass either of us). I had been recommended to him by another mapmaker who assumed I was female (and of course she was right), so S. assumed so as well.\n\nS. and I talked through emails throughout our collab, so everything was fine. Unlike French, my native language, English doesn't have gender agreements on verbs, nouns and adjectives, so my gender identity wasn't involved as we exchanged messages, and I didn't even have to know that I was female to him. But of course, there are pronouns. And of course, once the map was done and integrated to the books, I wanted to get copies of them for myself. So I ordered the books. And yesterday I've received them.\n\nHere's [a photo](https://snipboard.io/lRqY1A.jpg) of how S. credited me.\n\nIf you recall that I'm AMAB, that I live with my parents and that I didn't come out to them, you can guess the part that comes next: why was I credited as female? I explained that he “assumed”, English grammar not having written gender agreements etc., although not implying that he had assumed *wrong*, nor what he might have assumed it from. In the inside, I was exulting. But it didn't last for long. My two gender identities had met and I was thrown into introspection again.\n\nCoincidentally, last weekend, my girlfriend (LDR) told her parents that she had a girlfriend of her own (meaning me). So within a week, my feminine identity seeped into the “real world” twice. I had emotionally managed it the first time, but the books were the straw that broke the camel's back.\n\n# Why I needed to put it in words\n\nI know I'm genderqueer. I have thought it over long enough that that is a certainty. Also, being bigender has felt so right that I still think it defines me pretty well.\n\nYet, it practically made me lie to my parents about my gender identity. They barely know what gender identity means and my dad is too dramatically left behind compared to social progress to understand it anymore.\n\nI've had a lot of anxiety lately, sometimes thinking things like “why do I bother, being male is easier”. Which… it would be, if it were the least bit applicable to me. But it is not.\n\nAt first, I sought some comfort in the late r/bigender subreddit, but everybody looked so androgynous on their photos it made me feel worse. I like how I look, and I look definitely male. And I know these are plain legitimacy issues that I have all the reasons in the world to dismiss, because I'm allowed to feel how I feel and to be myself. But for the first time in months, I don't know what I am anymore, because two identities that I kept separate suddenly met and it shook me.\n\nThank you for reading this. It helped me organise my thoughts a bit, but I'm craving for advice too. If any of you have had similar experiences or if you think you know something that relates to what I have to overcome right now, please do share. :)"", 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Why yesterday was important for my bigender identity', 'created': 1601761189.0}"

So. For 7 years of my life thus far, I have understood myself to be a gay trans man. I did an assload of questioning myself in my middle school/highschool days and settled on the idea that I'm only attracted to men, and then *much* later, that I was a man myself. I was closeted for two years, and then shortly after starting college came out to my family. Overall supportive- and I've been on testosterone for two years.

Except,

I've always liked girly things. I went through a brief very feminine phase before really accepting that I was a trans man. And when the dysphoria wasn't too bad in the early days, I was still doing ""drag"" but had to abandon it because the dysphoria became too strong. But, within the past year particularly, I found a resurgence of my femininity. I started going out to the clubs with all my (majority cis) friends in the wigs and makeup and fem clothes and heels. And at the time it was just drag and I was still Allan and I didn't feel any different than any other gay man doing drag. 

But then we picked out a name for her. And things started to fucking change.

It was a painfully slow realization that I loved being called this new feminine name, and I loved being perceived as a woman and- (tmi) that I even loved being intimate with men as a woman. I liked the she/hers and the ma'ams and I liked being an extremely passable sexy woman. This, naturally, made me immediately fucking panic.

It literally feels insane to be ftm and be on testosterone and have so much dysphoria about your old feminine name and the way you used to look- but to have a feminine character you like to inhabit- and frequently. I also realized that my feminine half is blatantly bisexual. Just very obviously bisexual. And it's bringing my sexuality as a man into question as well, and this is the most distressing part because if I think about my own gender and sexuality every day and I still don't know anything about myself- I feel like every part of my identity is crumbling around me and I have no sense of stability in any part of my identity anymore. And none of my cis friends could understand at all.

My dilemma right now is trying to figure out if I also identify with an identity in the female spectrum. I am extremely feminine, the only changes I want in my body are a flat chest and male genitalia. I want to wear feminine clothes, act in a feminine matter and have feminine features on my body.

2020-10-05 18:23:39,j5othb,0,1,"Hi everyone! This is kind of an update, I guess? I’m the amab from a few weeks ago who wants to stay a man but also have a vagina instead of a penis. [Here’s a link to my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/hyc5he/what_am_i_feelingwhat_do_i_do_about_it/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) if you need a refresher or haven’t seen it in the first place. Basically, something happened that I want to talk about.

I was at work a few days ago and I just suddenly started thinking about my (nonexistent) vagina. I kept imagining my crotch suddenly being empty with a vagina in the place of my previous parts. It was so vivid that I could feel my (nonexistent) vaginal walls. This isn’t the weird part. This happens to me all the time. The weird part is that I suddenly started looking around me at all the male customers and imagining that they also had female parts (creepy, I know. I couldn’t help it). Everyone but me had female genitals in my mind and I started HYPERVENTILATING. Like, I straight up couldn’t breathe (I’m having trouble taking deep breaths just thinking about it 😅) I tried my best to stay out on the floor and keep stocking for about three hours, but it just kept getting worse and worse to the point where I had to sit down in the cooler to calm down (it helped a little bit). As I said, my vividly imagining myself with a vagina has happened before and happens frequently, and I usually feel somewhat short of breath when that happens, but I’ve never imagined other men around me as having vaginas or started hyperventilating because of it.

This is just a side note, but I very recently realized that the only reason I’ve ever been afraid to damage my penis and/or testicles is because I want kids someday. Take that as you will 🤷‍♂️

I know I can’t get evaluated without my parents finding out (I wouldn’t tell them if I got the surgery anyway because they would hopefully never see my vagina and it’s no one’s business but mine and my future partner’s 😂), so I kind of want to try “living with a vagina” for a while to see if,

1. This is something I actually want

2. It helps with whatever is going on in my head

I’m looking for preferably a prosthesis that looks like a vagina that I can also pee through so I don’t have to take it off during the day. I’m pretty sure they exist, but if I can’t find an affordable one, I would just make or buy a gaffe (I’ve done it before, homemade ones are hard to wear for more than a few hours). If you have any recommendations, I’d love to hear them!

I'm AMAB, bigender and I've gone through a trans phase and a genderfluid phase before that. Between mid-July and early October, being bigender suited me perfectly but lately I've been feeling like there was something more to it.

2020-10-06 18:47:48,j6ax35,4,2,"Hello all! I'm kinda  questioning my gender identity. I think I may be genderqueer. I’ve been thinking about this for like a year, and feel like I don't really identify with being a guy (to a full extent). It's really fluid, sometimes, I feel completely non masculine, but sometimes I would just rather be a normal guy. (TMI AHEAD) Some days, I would rather have a female lower anatomy. But I never want to be a girl or use she/her pronouns. 


Today, I just told my professor that I would rather use they/them pronouns.They were supportive, but it felt super weird, and almost didn’t seem like the entire story. I still like he/him pronouns! But, I also like they/them?? IDK, and I know some people switch between the two, but that just seems like such a hassle for both myself and others. I don’t wanna change myself  in any way, I don’t wanna make my gender identity such a big part of who I am, I just wanna be authentically me. Perhaps I am just gender non conforming? But honestly, I just pass as a gay guy (I’m bi, just better taste in fashion). I'm not huge on makeup, though I love painting my nails, and sometimes I wear more explicitly feminine clothing so I don’t really think I’m GNC.

I honestly really like the term genderqueer. I like how straight forward the word is. Gender, queer. Im queer, but in the sense of my gender identity. (not to mention, yall have the best flag in the community.)


I'm also scared of what my family will think. Which is honestly pretty silly. I live in a very proggresive household, and I have a few trans family members. I'm just scared they won't think what I'm feeling is valid. I'm even a little scared that I don't even know if what I'm feeling is valid.

2020-10-10 18:50:35,j8pymi,8,1,"I'm 27 years old and I'm in the process of coming out as nonbinary. I came out as bisexual at 19 in what feels like a totally different world. I wanted to say how impressed I am by all the Gen Zers who are figuring out their identities - y'all are so introspective and brave, asking yourselves these hard questions and grappling with the consequences in spite of everything else going on in the world. So I want to tell y'all about my experiences and give a little bit of advice for anyone struggling right now  💜 This is my story of growing up queer in the South in the 90s/00s. 

**1. My Story**

(tl;dr: Grew up in a conservative town in the South, repressed my identity for many years, came out as bi in college, coming out as nonbinary now with a serious partner and full-time job.)

I grew up in the 90s in the South. My parents were relatively liberal, but I was surrounded by conservatives that are now right-wing extremists. (I went to high school with a mass shooter that targeted a Hispanic church.) Some of my earliest memories were of me telling my mom that I hated dresses and skirts and the color pink. I remember being sooo mad that in the summer my brothers could play outside with their shirts off but I couldn't. 


My whole life, I gravitated to girls and boys equally. My friends were always split 50/50. I had my first kiss with a boy on the playground in preschool. I had my first kiss with a girl in gym class in the 1st grade. I had a crush on a boy in the 5th grade, then I had a crush on a girl in the 6th grade. I thought I might be bisexual, but bisexual was a dirty word, so I shoved those feelings deep down inside. 


Meanwhile, I was dressing in boys clothes because I hated the feeling of growing a chest and wanted to hide it. I had no idea this was dysphoria at the time - my mom put it down to me being a stubborn tomboy and just wanting to rebel in some way. We finally compromised on me wearing a wardrobe strictly consisting of jeans, t-shirts, and Converse. 


I graduated high school in 2011, so I was there from 2007 - 2011. My friends and I were deeply closeted, but we still managed to find our fellow queers. The first two guys I dated both turned out to be gay. I think we could feel that we saw each other and understood each other in ways other people didn't. I don't know if they were truly attracted to me or if they just felt pressured to get a girlfriend so people wouldn't suspect they were gay. Nowadays one of them is settled down with his partner of 6 years in the mountains in Colorado, and the other travels the world.


I went to a big public university in the South. I came out my sophomore year. I was dating a guy and told him about a sex dream I had involving a woman. He looked confused and asked me if I was bisexual. Something clicked. I told him yes, I guess I was bisexual. He told me he was bisexual too. We threw a coming out party and like 6 of our friends came out of the closet at once. It was nuts. A few months later, he broke my heart when he broke up with me because I reminded him too much of his mom. It be like that sometimes.


I dated a couple girls, but nothing turned into anything serious. I ended up moving to San Francisco after I graduated and dating a guy here for several years. I remember one conversation we had that pushed me further into the closet. I mentioned that I went through phases where I wore guy's clothes and in no uncertain terms he told me he found that unattractive and would leave me if that was the case. So I grew my hair out and wore more skirts to keep him. I finally broke up with him because he was dead set on having biological children, and I knew I couldn't make myself go through that. (As I would later learn, I have dysphoria around pregnancy/childbirth/breastfeeding.)


So that brings us to today. I've been dating a really great, supportive guy for several years now. We were on the same page about wanting to adopt kids. But something in our sex life was off. It finally clicked one night when he grabbed my boob and I screamed at him. I _hate_ my chest being touched. I have chest dysphoria. Suddenly, a whole fucking lifetime of signs made sense. 


My partner had some trouble processing it. He's a cishet so he hasn't had much exposure to gender issues. It took us a few weeks to get to a place where he really accepted it. Then I told my close friends. They were all very happy for me. 


I start a new job next week. I'm going to ask them to use they/them pronouns. I'm so nervous and excited. 


**2. Advice**

1. You are lovable. As the queer person you are, you are whole. You do not need to change to fit societal ideals so somebody will love you. People will tell you you need to dress a certain way and look a certain way to find a partner. The SF dating scene proves that that shit ain't true. Strive to be the best version of yourself and the rest will fall into place.

2. It gets easier. As you get older, you have more control over the people you surround yourself with. I live thousands of miles away from my family and don't plan to tell them any time soon. 

3. Take it one day at a time. These things may feel pressing but you have your whole life to figure it out. 


My DMs are always open if anyone wants to chat. 💚

I gonna meet my dermatologist today, to see if I'm able to start laser hair removal on my face.
I met him a month ago and he told me I had too much tan to use the laser safely.

He gave me few things to use to help my tan to fade, a peeling and an exfoliating cream.

But I have few questions you may ask.

-what will happen if he uses the laser on my skin if I still have a light tan (my skin is Mediterranean, it's hard to tell what comes from the sun and the natural skin tone).

-I'm very proud of my skin, it's bright, smooth (thanks to god, I never had acnea). Is there a risk that my skin could be damaged by the laser?

During this time, my spouse has been indifferent but uncomfortable (when you are with someone a long time, you can read and know).  Last night we talked about it and I was genuinely surprised at how open-minded she is as a person to progressive ideas of sexual orientation and gender identification BUT how uncomfortable she is with it in her own home.   She is clearly uncomfortable in a way that translates to me feeling very isolated and alone.

Yes, I understand change, especially change in a long, long term relationship is hard and takes time.

I went from being somewhere in the 160s (I'm 4'10) to now under 100 pounds.

After I had lost all of the weight my chest was non existent and I noticed a feeling of confidence that I carried myself with.

During this semester of college, I’ve been taking my first Women’s and Gender Studies class and we have had lots of discussion on the social construction of both gender and sex, as well as learning the difference between gender acquisition, gender identity, and gender expression. Because of this, I’ve started questioning my own gender identity and have come to one conclusion: I have always identified as a woman because that is the label the rest of the world has applied to me. When I try to think of what my gender identity is, or ask myself the question “What does it feel like to be a woman?” my thoughts come up blank, because I only know that I just experience the world as myself and not as a category of person. 

This is when I reached another conclusion: If the world  identified me as a man or as non-binary or as another gender, I wouldn’t be uncomfortable with that because there is no personal connection I have with any of these labels. I’ve never felt my gender identity, so it is entirely dependent on others perceptions of me. 

However, this feels like it’s somehow “incorrect”; that I should really care about how I feel as a gendered being, but I can’t identify what the feeling of a specific gender is. I’m not uncomfortable being identified as a woman, but I also don’t think I’d be uncomfortable being identified as a man or another gender identity (I’d be shocked if these were someone’s first assumptions about my gender because I’ve always been identified by others to be a woman, but I don’t think I would feel the need to correct anyone who assumed I wasn’t a woman).

I often feel both like a man or woman, sometimes more one gender than the other.

I came back to my dermatologist in August and he told me my skin got too much tan and that I had to wait.
He gave me some peeling to do twice a week and some exfoliating cream to use everyday.

I went back yesterday and he told me my skin was OK and ready to be lasered.

But I chickened out.

I told him I had to think more.

I'm afraid my transition won't go well, and that in few months/years I'll detransition and look weird as a man with smooth skin
I'm afraid the laser will burn my skin.
I'm afraid I'll spend thousand of euros in laser sessions and won't have results.

Thank you for accepting me in. I’m a straight CIS female, and I have a real life situation that I would like to ask advice on, if I may, please? If I use incorrect terms, please correct me - I’m here to learn.

I have neighbours, a couple - one a male, and a the other a non-binary person who was assigned female at birth. They use their given name, but they openly identify as gender fluid.

I am always careful to use the correct pronouns when talking to, and referring to them. However, I became unstuck during a conversation with a third party. I wanted to say (not real names) “oh you know Dave and Becky - they’re Jessica’s mom and dad”.

But then it hit me. Is there a correct term for a gender fluid person who is a parent, but identifies as they? I don’t want to offend by referring to “mom” if there is a more appropriate term. I haven’t heard how the daughter refers to them.

However, I became unstuck during a conversation with a third party. I wanted to say (not real names) “oh you know Dave and Becky - they’re Jessica’s mom and dad”.\n\nBut then it hit me. Is there a correct term for a gender fluid person who is a parent, but identifies as they? I don’t want to offend by referring to “mom” if there is a more appropriate term. I haven’t heard how the daughter refers to them. \n\nI’m sorry if this sounds stupid. I don’t mean to offend - I genuinely want to learn. \n\nThank you.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Question about non-binary naming', 'created': 1603589232.0}"

2020-10-28 05:51:38,jjibzu,9,1,"Hi!  

So terms have me confused.  They always have.  I’m 41.  Recently I have come to understand I am intersex (aromatase condition as well as a genetic abnormality which did not have its associated effect of xy sex reversal).  In addition I am a retransitioner (MtFtMtF).

So here’s the thing...I have always wanted to be a woman/female.  But I’ve also in the same breath identified personality wise with men (INTJ type is the rarest among females).  I’m sexually and emotionally attracted to feminine energy.  So recently for the past year or so I’ve started to refer to myself as a tomboy...a trans female tomboy.

But I’m also a bit more feminine..I mean I like to play with my hair and practice my makeup skills; paint my nails. 

I don’t fit in the stereotypical places for gender but I feel like I fit in as I would normally had I been born female and just had some masculine traits and hung out with the guys while still saving a good chunk
of my femininity.  Another thing...I need to transition..my dysphoria isn’t overwhelming but it’s there and I can’t live the rest of my life as a guy.

I also don’t want body hair, face hair.  Want breast.  Want bottom surgery but I’m married so thats difficult.   I have a fear of being stuck in-between between male and female. 

I’d prefer she/her but I don’t pass now and pronouns don’t really matter to me.  Being considerate and respect do.

What exactly are my terms; I can’t figure out a term to describe me; I am really from before all these new terms but I fear they don’t fit me or are too broad where I am lumped with something I’m not.

Does girlygirl tomboy transgender intersex lesbian woman sound confusing to a listener? 

Am I gender queer or non binary or just trans only.  Should the masculine/feminine personality type be separated from the gender identity?

I told him to go away since I needed time to recover. He kept insisting that we talk as I kept telling him to go away.
