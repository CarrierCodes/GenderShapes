2020-09-01 01:35:46,ikb6h6,1,1,"Hey y'all,

So, I've identified as genderfluid/non-binary for the past year or so. Before that, I was exploring things and seeing if it was right for me (short answer: it was). I have been using my preferred pronouns since then and been more non-binary in my presentation, both at work and around town.

However, up until now I've never fully ""come out"", so to speak. Except for my wife, her family, and a co-worker, I haven't sat down with anyone to tell them about my gender identity. I've been who I am, using my pronouns and presenting how I want. When people have asked about it (e.g. ""Why do you use they/them?""), I told them. Basically, I didn't shout it from the rooftops, but I didn't hide it either.

That being said, I'm getting to the point where I want to tell more people, at least my co-workers and a good portion of my friends. I have been using my pronouns on Twitter and have had ""non-binary/genderfluid"" on my bio for a while. So, I figure there might be a good place to start since it's entirely co-workers and colleagues from other schools. I can't on Facebook yet though; my family are on there and they are very conservative, very Christian. I'm honestly dreading that day.

So, I guess I'm asking y'all, how have y'all handled, as I call it, ""partial' coming outs? Any advice or suggestions? 

I hope this post made sense. Thanks for any advice!

As a kid I was very much a tomboy. Had no interest in makeup or jewelry, wore my long hair in a ponytail until at 13 I cut it to 2-3 inches long.

In high school I didn‚Äôt have much of an interest in ‚Äúgirly stuff‚Äù until I had a bf. I wanted to look and feel attractive so I wore heels and miniskirts and low-cut tops. But I always felt like it wasn‚Äôt me and I was putting on a costume or was just massively overdressed. I also eventually grew my hair out &amp; even wore it down occasionally. I wore men‚Äôs clothes for the first time, a suit for a presentation. I was expecting to feel weird but it felt perfectly comfortable. Around now is also when I started wearing men‚Äôs shoes because many women‚Äôs shoes (especially sneakers) felt completely garish and wrong. I still wore heels and flats, but a lot of daily wear shoes were men‚Äôs sneakers or loafers.

In college I started wearing makeup and dresses/skirts got more comfortable, mainly because I wore spats underneath. I chopped my hair super short again and decided to let it grow again. I realized I hated bras and now only wear bandeaus or sport bras to stop the jiggle and clap if I‚Äôm going out. I‚Äôve also tried a few men‚Äôs shirts and pants and realized I quite like the way I look in them, especially if I‚Äôm mixing it up (men‚Äôs shirt with a bubble skirt and leather boots are üëåüèª). I also love wearing my bf‚Äôs shorts and tanks, and not just bc they are his.

Now I‚Äôm at a point where I feel comfortable enough to really stop and think and try to change into who I really want to be. I realized I‚Äôm asexual and panromantic, and honestly I don‚Äôt really see gender, just people who wear different clothes or use different pronouns.

If I could create myself irl with like a Sims template, I would choose a thin but toned, small-chested, short-haired person who dresses in everything from pretty dresses and makeup to men‚Äôs polos and cargo pants. I‚Äôm planning to cut my hair short again because as beautiful as my long hair is now (sounds vain I know but I finally figured out how curls and product work), its so much effort and I miss having it short. I‚Äôm also planning to get a breast reduction (34F to 34B) because I like the look and feel of smaller boobs, and these jugs really don‚Äôt look like me.

‚ÄòWoman‚Äô feels like ‚Äúthem‚Äù rather than ‚Äúus‚Äù. I don‚Äôt feel like woman is the wrong word, but its not entirely accurate either. I definitely don‚Äôt feel like a man, but I have masculine traits and love wearing men‚Äôs clothes and am fine with looking for androgynous.

2020-09-04 04:25:44,im9cz6,1,1,"Hi, hopefully this doesn't come across as controversial or offensive, but I would really like the community's opinions on mine - after posting this on a few LGBT subreddits and having it being taken down (but idrk why ?? I'm just trying to learn and understand myself and the LGBT community) I think I might identify best with being a demigirl but it's not super important to me and I think identifying as a demigirl publicly will be more stressful than not (especially since it's not widely known) ? so..

I'd like some answers as to how to know if I'm really a demigirl and ? I think most people don't even know what a demigirl is ! There are soo many terms out there so I am feeling kind of overwhelmed. I want to know how people deal with their own situations / what it really means to be a demigirl / nonbinary.

I think on the spectrum of 0 being female and 1 being male I am probably somewhere like 0.3 so I don't really think I am perfectly in she or they. In the past growing up I was probably more like 0.4 - 0.7 but over time I've conformed with society and puberty..? lol

*(but also what does that mean?? why do I care about what society deems to be a woman and why does it matter to me can't I just do whatever I want without caring about pronouns and just expect the same treatment as any other gender?)*

Throughout my life I have thought that if I was born as a male I probably would not transition to a woman. As I have gotten older I have become more comfortable with being a woman and my appearance/preferences/behavior nowadays are more of what society expects a woman to be but I don't think I'd consider myself to be gender-fluid/nonbinary either.

There has been a lot of push to encourage people to state their pronouns when introducing themselves. Personally I am not super comfortable with introducing myself with my pronouns, mostly because of sexism (**how I am treated/regarded as since I'm not an abled rich straight cis white man**) but also because I don't strongly feel associated as any of the 3 categories.

I identify as mostly(?) female and I am uncomfortable with stating that because I think it puts an emphasis on my gender - I do not like being treated as a female just because I'm a female, and all the social expectations that come with being labeled as a female (even though a blind man could probably tell that I'm a woman (since I've conformed over time and with puberty)). **But is there any other reason to identify as a certain gender?** I think *certain actions, appearances, behavior, etc. should not be associated with any gender.* But obviously eliminating the concept of gender is impossible, especially with our society and the English language.

I do not get offended if someone misgenders me (I have a cultural name so I have been addressed as Mr quite often in email correspondence and when I was younger quite a lot of people thought I was a boy from my appearance/behavior) (**passerby have literally asked if I was a boy or a girl and I would reply that I was an alien when I was 6**), and would **honestly prefer it if people didn't know what my gender was**. Ultimately, I do not really want to be outright associated with a certain gender, but do not want to be labeled as nonbinary either.

And I'd like to point out - a lot of parents choose to name their daughters with a gender-neutral name to avoid gender biases as much as possible - and I feel the same way - so wouldn't stating your gender/pronouns be defeating the purpose?

Ultimately I guess I would identify as she/they but I'm not sure what the purpose of identifying as that would be since I don't want any different treatment or attention than if I said I was male/female.

2020-09-06 11:47:01,inkpgc,3,1,"I'm AFAB, and for the longest time I've always disliked presenting feminine. There were times that I wished that I were born a guy, and on the internet I do my best to present masculine. But the thing is, despite wishing I was born a guy, I don't want to transition into one. It would've been nice if I was a boy from the start, but since I was born a girl, I don't.. particularly want to transition? I'm fine with being a girl and I'm fine with people who see me irl (whether it be strangers or someone close to me) calling me she/her and such.

The thing is though, on the internet, if someone correctly guesses she/her, I get sad. I guess it's like, since they're not seeing what I look like and yet still correctly guess she/her, it makes me feel that I didn't present masculine enough online. I keep my pronouns hidden with the hopes that people would mistake me as a guy. When people online refer to me as he/him, I don't correct them. If anything, I feel giddy and happy, as if it's almost like a guilty pleasure or something. I guess what I'm trying to say is, I personally wouldn't label myself as male or put he/him in my bio, but if someone were refer to me as being male or he/him, I wouldn't correct it.

I've thought about maybe being non-binary since I'm distant from femininity, but that doesn't really feel right either. I should clarify that, with people who are close to me + acquaintances, I want them them to use she/her. For me, it would feel weird if they used he/him or they/them or called me by another name. It might be a ""worried about stigma"" thing, but again, I don't feel sad or offended by the people around me calling me female; I'm okay with identifying as female around them. The reason why I say I don't really think non-binary is the right label is also because if people on the internet were to see me as non-binary, that doesn't... really give me the same happiness I feel from being called he/him?

Like, err, recently I became acquaintances with an online friend group (no one in the group is anyone I know irl) and when introducing myself, I used he/him instead of the usual she/they or ""any pronouns"" and it felt... really nice?? Like, it felt liberating almost. I know gender =/= pronouns, but I know they would see he/him and likely view me as male or at least masculine, and the thought of that really made me happy.

Recently, I saw a cute drawing from this genderfluid person who described their different genders. One was labeled ""The Female Me"", which is how they present with their female friends. One said ""The Non-Binary Me"", which is how they present when they're at work or with their male friends. And one said ""The Bigender Me"", which is how they present when they're with someone very close. Seeing the drawing made me think of myself. When I'm with female friends, I'd be okay with presenting both as a feminine or as a masculine girl (I wouldn't mind wearing skirts, but I probably still wouldn't wear anything girly or frilly). When I'm with my family, male friends, or most anyone I have some sort of relationship with (i.e. coworkers, etc.), I want to only present as being masculine/androgynous, but while maintaining she/her (so possibly non-binary but with she/her pronouns? though, I probably wouldn't tell most people that I'm non-binary, I'd probably just be female). And when I'm with online strangers or in general how I present to the general public, I want to be called he/him (I would be okay if someone called me she/they, but I would vastly prefer he/him). This could be me presenting as bigender? Or at the very least, masculine leaning. I would be okay with people referring me as being any gender, and I would be okay with presenting both feminine and male aspects of myself (i.e. talking to some people in a girl-ish way, but in general I'd talk/act in a masculine way), I would just vastly prefer being called a guy or being called he/him.

To summarize it, I experience different things depending on who I'm with. I wouldn't call it gender dysphoria per se, but a close friend calling me she/her and an online stranger calling me she/her would elicit different emotional responses. I don‚Äôt know if a label like non-binary would fit me because even if someone were to call me male/female, I wouldn‚Äôt feel upset (and I want to be called male in some cases), which is why I‚Äôm thinking I might be bigender or genderfluid? I guess I'm asking because it seems that for a lot of genderfluid people, their gender differs based on day and not based on who they're with? So I didn't know if genderfluid was the right word, or if what I'm feeling/experiencing has a different label.

I‚Äôve identified as a straight guy for my whole childhood.

Boys can‚Äôt say another man is attractive unless they‚Äôre gay. So after all this time, I have to say, I‚Äôm quite sick of being a straight dude. And I don‚Äôt know what that means exactly. Is it possible that I‚Äôm just fed up with society and that I should simply be a very feminine straight man? Or recently I‚Äôve been questioning whether or not I‚Äôm genderqueer, or demifluid. 

I wore makeup the other day and I‚Äôve never felt more free and less anxious. I‚Äôve had dreams of being in a girls body and loving it. I like painting my nails. I want to get my ears pierced, yet, at the same time, I still feel kinda like a guy.

So what does that mean? Because I don‚Äôt want to conform with my gender role, does that mean that I‚Äôm gender nonconforming? I feel free when expressing myself in the ways I want to. And I know it‚Äôs up to me to decide what label I give myself that allows me to do that freely. 

I was hoping maybe some of you might have similar stories, or share some things that have helped. I appreciate your time.

2020-09-07 20:59:41,iofzxk,6,1,"My whole life (23 years) I have identified as a cis woman. Growing up, it was hard for me to relate to other girls, and the few times when I would join in and play house, I would always take on masculine roles like the dad or uncle. Mostly though, my friends were guys and we played video games or did other nerdy stuff. I was always very artistic but I didn't share this part of myself with others. When puberty eventually hit, I hated it. I developed way earlier than other girls my age but I rejected bras and makeup. It took me years to ask for a bra because it felt so... not me, but it felt worse to not cover up.

Fast forward to the end of high school and I realized I was bi. I always had long hair but I decided to cut it off into a pixie cut and I never before felt more like myself. I thought this bi realization explained everything but now that it has been about 4 years I've realized this may not explain everything. About a year ago, I really started thinking about my gender expression and the different ways I dress depending on how I'm feeling on a given day, and I've tried to talk to others about it, and they mostly could not relate. My boyfriend gave the example that since I don't bind, I am probably cis, but at the time I thought to myself ""Oh shit I totally would bind though"". It hit me that back when I played sports in school, I LOVED wearing a sports bra because it made me completely flat. I would even wear my sports bra for the rest of the day after practice because I loved how I looked so much. What got me questioning my gender identity was my boobs lol. I woke up a few weeks ago and snapped my friends that I would love if I woke up one day with no boobs and they were like ??? can't relate.

I have always had an androgynous personality, I feel like I have a lot of stereotypically male and female traits. So although my outer gender expression may lean more stereotypical female, internally, I feel completely in the middle if not more masculine. 

Another thing that has now struck me is that sometimes when I picture sex, I think of it from a man's perspective. Like how good it would feel to have a dick and fuck someone??? I'm a super sexual person and I always thought this was just a weird kink but now I'm like wait a second...

And I guess the hardest part about all of this for me is that it is making me realize my internalized transphobia. I definitely have internalized stigma against trans/nonbinary people that I was unaware of. Personally I have 0 bottom dysphoria and I like the pronouns she/her, which also makes me wonder if that is okay for a nonbinary person, or if this is how my stigma is manifesting.

Personally I have 0 bottom dysphoria and I like the pronouns she/her, which also makes me wonder if that is okay for a nonbinary person, or if this is how my stigma is manifesting. \n\nAnyway, I just needed to get this out somewhere because I don\'t really know anyone irl who relates.

Hey, I‚Äôm really new to the idea of there being multiple genders, transitioning, and the whole concept of being gender queer. 

To my understanding, sex is being born either male or female (with parts that correspond), and is used mainly for medically (or otherwise) identifying reasons. Universal to pretty much all animal species correct (save a few lol)? 

So I‚Äôm confused on what gender is supposed to be... I understand that there are preexisting gender (I guess sex?) roles and that it‚Äôs generally conformed to or followed but wouldn‚Äôt being gender queer be to stray away from those roles and is to feel the way the other sex is?

But if so, I‚Äôm confused on why straying away from the stereotypical gender (sex) roles or feeling unlike the sex you were born results in wanting to be biologically labeled as the other sex. For what I understand, there are more feminine guys or Tom boyish girls. What really makes the gender queer community want to alter their preexisting body to that of the other sex, or change their hormones? Is sex something above the concept of a biological label in which one sex has a penis and the other has a vagina?

I don‚Äôt really know where to start, I think my whole life I haven‚Äôt really felt like I fit into one gender, although I always just considered myself a cis woman.

I never felt like they were trying to put me in a box so that probably helped me feel like I was able to express myself freely and fluidly.

Once I got older I realized I wasn‚Äôt straight and came out and I‚Äôve been openly queer for a few years. I now have a solid group of lgbtq+ folx in my life who have taught me a lot and helped me to learn and also unlearn a lot and give me space to start to question my gender. 

I started to realize I probably fell more into non-binary but I‚Äôve always felt weirdly invalid in that as some of the time I present pretty feminine.

I recently decided to change my pronouns publicly to ‚Äúshe/they‚Äù as that‚Äôs what feels most comfortable right now.

2020-09-17 05:14:29,iuczvn,0,1," So I've been thinking more (i know, that doesn't seem possible to think  MORE about this thing when i already think about it enough..). I've been  feeling a lot more like a boy recently, or maybe im crazy. I don't  actually know whats considered 'masculinity'. like at all - unless my  guess of like football, being competitive all the time, demanding, and  rude  is correct - which i hope is not. 

Basically sometimes I feel  more like a dude, sometimes im just like whatever, i dont really think i  have a gender today, but i never really feel like a girl. some people  might be thinking 'oh well demiboy right?'. but idk ;/  because to be demiboy (and correct me if im wrong) is going between boy  and enby fluidly, never reaching the girl side of the spectrum, right?   
and  while i never feel like i am a girl, i never really feel like im NOT a  girl? like theres still that part of me thats says you're still a tad  bit girlll. and i don't know if this is internalized trans-phobia or  something, maybe i just have some sort of bias saying ""no youre still a  girl somewhere deep down, even if its mainly boy""  


when i think of  being like demiboy, and not at all girl, not even close to feeling like  a girl (other than the fact that id still wear skirts if i felt like it  because id feel fucking cute, but that has nothing to do with my  genderrrrrrrrrr) i know that id be super happy, id be thrilled if people  reffered to me as he/they. but currently theres still a part of me that  thinks maybe im just genderfluid or something, and that im still partly  girl.  
 But just thinking of being genderfluid confuses me because it  just seems more ridgid than demigirl/boy, because its more of a ""girl,  boy, enby, pick one tahts you for the day."" obviously its not that  simple, just picking and chosing, but it feels more rijid than  genderflux.. i dont know but genderfluid definetly doesnt suit me, but i  dont know yet if im actually demi boy for sure. ill definitely be  overthinking this for the next few years.

I'm still struggling to effectively explain some of the details about how my like, masculinity/femininity meter shifts on an everyday basis to my loved ones, and maybe to myself.

I've recently met a really great guy that I've hit it off with, we're long distance so it's only messages and sometimes calls.

But here's my thing: How the hell do people even think about eventually having sex with someone as the gender they weren't assigned?
We did basically written roleplay with the guy and it was great and I still beam like an idiot every time I think back to it, and just how loving and nurturing that entire situation felt. But I always get anxious when I think about doing more stuff when I'm feeling masculine. Bc it feels like, ideally I would just, shapeshift like Loki in the comics or something.

I'm here today because even though I'm AMAB, I've always struggled with this whole ""being a man"" thing. I'm mostly okay with my body, and I'm okay with presenting myself as a male, since I feel like my gender identity is no one else's business except mine and people like my closest friends and my SO.  
But I've always felt like something was off with me. I've always felt like I wasn't entirely a boy, but I never fully seen myself as a girl either.  
Instead, in my mind I've often labeled myself as a mixture of both and I've always agreed with that.  
Although I have stereotypical male hobbies like skateboard, computers, video games etc, as a kid I always enjoyed to play with dolls, or anything that is stereotypically female.  
And with time I also developed interest in makeup, nail painting, especially when I started a relationship with my current significant other who is quite open minded and actually enjoyed me being genuinely interested.  
And all of this situation lasted until tonight, when I was in quite an observation of myself, trying to figure out once and for all who I want to be.   
And I came to a realisation that I really do not identify my gender as fully male, and that I needed to put a name on it for real. Actually acknowledging it sparked a million questions in my head and so I've looked things up, but definitions I've read all seem really abstract to me and instead of getting answers, I only got more questions.

I'm 36, AMAB and I've known since probably my early teens that I didn't feel comfortable with my gender identity. I happily embraced it during my late teens and early 20s and would dress and present however I felt: dresses, skirts, makeup, whatever, but largely masc. I settled down, married and have really spent the last 15 or so years hiding behind a mask of well...masc! I've gained weight, a big manly beard and an unhealthy dose of dysphoria and self loathing. I have no style and basically dress as an amorphous blob in a t-shirt and shorts. 

Lockdown has given me plenty of time to self reflect and has led to crippling dysphoria and anxiety.  I've had enough of hiding how I really feel. Last week I came out as *not cis* to my wife of 13 years. She's super cool with it, and was like ""yeah, that doesn't surprise me"". Just having the conversation lifted a huge weight. My wife is awesome.   
 I want to present more femme. I don't *think* I'm trans. I'm just not happy identifying as cis male.  Genderqueer seems like a better descriptor for me than enby, so that's what I'm going with.   


So, I know how I feel and I know how I want to appear, but I don't know how to do it. I've spent the last week experimenting with eye makeup and today I felt confident enough to wear subtle eye makeup out to meet some friends. They didn't comment on it, so I guess that's a win. My hair is I think easily feminised, being bright red, shoulder length and undercut. I'm going to a fantastic gender neutral barber next week to see what can be done.  I don't know if I want to keep my beard, trim it short or bin it entirely. To be decided.  I'm playing with pronouns. He/him doesn't feel right. They/them feels like a plural.  It was far easier to be femme 15 years ago before my weight went up.   


I wish I had better support networks. Despite living in probably the most LGBTQ friendly city in the UK (Manchester!), I have absolutely no idea where to go next. I don't know where to get clothes that won't make me look like a fat bloke in a frock. I don't know where to get non-judgemental advice on makeup (my wife isn't very femme, so isn't really able to advise!).

It feels dumb to say, but I've thought about this my entire life but yet I've never thought about what would happen should I actually come out. Now I have, I'm at a loss! Can anyone help?

I'm just done with my life. So let's start this off with that I'm a closeted pansexual and genderfluid/genderqueer person (These terms mean the same for me personally). I am born in the South where people like me don't exist (unless you want to be attacked or disowned). I've been living in the closet for like 3 years now. I kinda sorta come out to my CLOSEST friends that I'm pan during my highschool sophomore year. I've never told them I'm trans since I've discovered that about myself 2 years later. Either way I've never trusted them to tell them cause of my fear of being outed and ""exposed"". So with being in closet, I've had my superlows. I remember one period of my life where I've felt out my body and in space. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forwarding to about Jan-Feb. 2020 (Pre-Quarantine), my mental health worsen and it continue to be that way throughout Quarantine until my first week of college. Why did my mental health worsen? Well, because I don't feel happy wearing this mask for my family. This mask is a different person. I don't enjoy life being this person. I want to be myself and be happy, but my family will not accept a s\*ssy or f\*g in their home. Based on how they look at people who are similar to the real me, they call them slurs and have a negative attitude against them. One instance was my cousin calling a gay man a f\*ggot at my high-school graduation. I was expecting the reaction, but it still hurts. 

&amp;#x200B;

So moving on to my first week of college, my mental health got slightly better because I was living in the dorms alone and I could be myself a bit. Not too much though cuz I am in a college that is very close to my family so they can come and visit at any time. Things were looking ok. 

&amp;#x200B;

Until a fucking hurricane came and struck the next week, lol. So as of right now I've been living in a hotel with my toxic family. Been having thoughts of just jumping out the window, k\*lling myself, and funny thing I would never do it cuz I'm afraid of suicide. I can't even pulled myself to do my college work cause like what's the point of continuing if I can't truly be myself in this world. I just want to die and be reincarnated into something else.

However my parents still slip up quite a lot. Is it normal for them to be unable to start viewing me subconsciously as their child not their daughter? It makes me sad every time but maybe I'm being impatient :/

Also I personally like having long hair because I feel comfy with it but it's widely perceived as feminine. Any tips on appearing more androgynous without cutting it? (I already wear a binder)

Another thing I've been thinking about a lot is my name. It's Marishelle, which is very unique but also feminine sounding sadly. I think I want to change my name to Mars but idk how to make it official/legal. I'm 17 and in the UK for context. Is this straightforward to do?

Okay finally, I'm interested in microdosing on testosterone (or other hormones that'll help me masculinise a bit). I was afab and I hate my chest and thighs etc. Thing is I only want to change my fat placement to give me a more androgynous figure (I can't afford top surgery rn).

2020-09-26 05:54:04,j00hq7,4,1,"Hi all! So early this morning I came out to my girlfriend. I've been struggling with self-doubt about my gender for a long time, and I've finally decided that I'm somewhere in the non-binary spectrum, to put it loosely. The label that I've been using (though not to full satisfaction, based on indecision and uncertainty) is demigirl. However I'm not sure that's the ""correct"" term to use as far as definition goes, and I'd like some opinions on what suits the description of my gender best.

To be as short and concise as possible ~~(spoiler: I wasn't, I'm sorry)~~, I am an AFAB person who identifies as a woman about 65% of the time, and non-binary for the other 35%. Of course that may not be an entirely perfect percentile range, but you get the idea. Basically I (usually) identify as a woman more often than I do non-binary. Which I feel applies to the ""demigirl"" label.

However, I don't feel these things at the same time, and I think that's what ""demigirl"" is trying to imply; that you feel like both at the same time, but... have a stronger connection/preference to being a woman? Please excuse me if I'm wrong, I am an absolute baby-queer when it comes to this stuff and I'm still trying to figure out my own feelings, let alone how to accurately describe and/or understand certain concepts/labels (I'm very open to learning though!!).

To me, it seems more like I might be ""genderfluid"" in that I don't really experience both at the same time--I still normally express myself androgynously while feeling a stronger connection to being a woman, but I don't see that as experiencing both feelings at the same time; that's more just an expression of who I am as a person. I've never been particularly feminine or masculine; I've ridden the middle line for most of my controllable (yay for LGBTphobic parents!) life. 

I have times where I love looking more feminine and being called a woman, using she/her pronouns, etc, and there's other times where I'm okay with she/her pronouns because that's what I'm used to, but I don't really identify or *want* to identify as a woman, among other things (which are still hard for me to explain right now; I've fought being nonbinary for a long time and have a long road ahead of me until I'm more comfortable and secure trying to ""explain"" that part of me, especially since it's still largely misunderstood by me; thankfully I don't have to ""justify"" myself here).

I've also heard mentions of a label called ""bigender"" that sounds kind of similar to me, but I don't know a lot about that one yet, honestly. One of my biggest hang-ups about not using ""bigender"" (if it's even applicable) or ""genderfluid"" is because it seems like there's a lot of bias that it's mostly used by people who feel both male and female, and I'm *definitely* not male. That I know for certain, and I *never* want to be taken that way. Are they still ""usable"" for people who identify as nonbinary and woman?

Any opinions, advice, resources, etc, are all extremely welcome. And if there's need for more information to base opinions on labels, I'm more than happy to provide!

This discovery came from being pregnant with a female fetus and finding that everyone wanted to immediately assign gender norms to my daughter. It made me feel incredibly dysphoric for months and I couldn't even leave bed or shower because I was so depressed. Figuring out this identity is the only thing that broke me out of it. I'm 22 weeks with her now and feel this horrible pressure to figure everything out before she arrives. My pronouns are still she/her. 

Basically, the way that I feel is, sometimes I'm both masculine and feminine at the same time, sometimes I'm neither, sometimes I'm feminine and, sometimes I'm masculine. 

I always try to incorporate a hint of femininity in my presentation because I'm having a huge problem with the erasure of my old identity as a CIS woman. I feel like I'm erasing all of the struggles and triumphs I've gone through as a woman and am struggling with it. I feel like an imposter as a CIS woman but, I'm terrified of experiencing gatekeeping as a genderqueer person. I thought of saying that I'm a genderqueer woman but, that doesn't sound right. That isn't how I identify. 

I just feel like, if I'm not mostly masculine presenting everyday, no one will actually believe that this is my identity. I just don't understand the erasure of femininity in gender neutral/genderqueer presentation. I have alot of questions as I'm still learning about my identity. 

I'm indigenous and what led me to the genderqueer identity is the term Two-Spirit. It described me perfectly and genderqueer was the most synonymous to that term. I'm not trans and I'm not nonbinary but, I've noticed that most of the people who identify with this term are one or the other or both. I feel very confused at this because I see genderqueer as separate from those identities for me.

2020-09-28 15:57:03,j1enx6,4,1,"I have not really questioned my gender before to be honest. I used to think you could be male or female and there was no in-between. Now I know this is not the case. I did used to worry that I was transgender and spend days trying to figure it out, but I always came the the conclusion that I was not. 

However, now I know better, I am thinking that if I were to label myself as non-binary or explore that side of myself it might help. The next bit is to explain why and get it off my chest as I haven't spoken to anybody about this before. I appreciate that this post is long - if you do read it, thank you so much.

I've struggling with my identity and gender as far back as I can remember. However, it has always been in very insidious ways. For example, as a child I was very picky about my style. Like if my mother made me wear a dress, I would style them with wellington boots or something. 

I have always been quite skinny but a few years ago, I gained a bit of weight and it sent me down a negative spiral and I became really depressed - it was only a stone but I felt like I couldn't recognise myself. I lost that weight and ever since then I have kept my body as skinny as I can. I think one of the main reasons is that any more weight would make me look more feminine. I have a very 'straight up and down' figure but I still look at my breasts and wish they were smaller. 

I do exercise quite often, but I remember as a teenager, doing exercise occasionally made me feel sad because I knew it didn't matter how hard I worked, I couldn't get the desired figure (the figure being a fit male torso). However, I do feel differently now, I have come to terms with a more feminine athletic body. 

I came out as lesbian a few years ago. This was a really empowering moment for me. When I have crushes on girls or a girlfriend, it makes me feel more in tune with the masculine side of me, it's not that I feel female or male, I just feel like neither. 

The thing is that's weird as well, I am a 'typical girl' in many ways, even though I hate when people think of me as a typical girl - I do have a lot of typical feminine traits like I am nurturing and sensitive etc. However, I am also extremely ambitious, like the idea of being the breadwinner at home and love to be in leadership positions at work, not because I love the power, but because they make me feel less dysphoric. 

However, I do think gender is complicated, my understanding of gender used to be very rigid, and now it's much more fluid, which has helped calm my dysphoric feelings a lot. I think in my head, I'd love to be a 'tomboy' type girl, which I suppose I am - but possibly the phrase 'tomboy' waters down the experience that I have with my gender? 

I feel like I've always related the most to effeminate males and androgynous females. When I'm with cis straight women, even though we look similar, I feel I'm from another planet. 

Over the past year, I've been on a journey of being more accepting and comfortable with myself (possibly an outcome of social distancing). I have started to accept that feminine clothes just aren't for me and that's okay. Luckily, fashion is becoming a lot more androgynous - I have personally been obsessed with cargo trousers. However, I do struggle with dysphoria, but much less than I used to now that I have found a few ways to accept the masculine side of myself. 

Sorry if I have offended anybody during this. Honestly, my understanding of gender is not that vast, only my own personal experience. If I have said anything offensive, please correct me.

I used to think you could be male or female and there was no in-between. Now I know this is not the case. I did used to worry that I was transgender and spend days trying to figure it out, but I always came the the conclusion that I was not. \n\nHowever, now I know better, I am thinking that if I were to label myself as non-binary or explore that side of myself it might help. The next bit is to explain why and get it off my chest as I haven't spoken to anybody about this before. I appreciate that this post is long - if you do read it, thank you so much.\n\nI've struggling with my identity and gender as far back as I can remember. However, it has always been in very insidious ways. For example, as a child I was very picky about my style. Like if my mother made me wear a dress, I would style them with wellington boots or something. \n\nI have always been quite skinny but a few years ago, I gained a bit of weight and it sent me down a negative spiral and I became really depressed - it was only a stone but I felt like I couldn't recognise myself. I lost that weight and ever since then I have kept my body as skinny as I can. I think one of the main reasons is that any more weight would make me look more feminine. I have a very 'straight up and down' figure but I still look at my breasts and wish they were smaller. \n\nI do exercise quite often, but I remember as a teenager, doing exercise occasionally made me feel sad because I knew it didn't matter how hard I worked, I couldn't get the desired figure (the figure being a fit male torso).

I just finished writing a ballet about gender fluidity, even though I was too afraid to admit to myself that thats what its about for the 2 years I worked on it.

My biggest apprehension is the women in my life who are gonna feel like I am ""abandoning"" the club of women. Like it's the ""easy way out"" of being a woman, to declare being queer.

We are living in such an incredible magical period of opening up our self-expressions and collective understanding of gender, and if people try on terminology and explore their identity, isn't that ultimately GOOD? maybe I am way off, but I wanna live in a society where you have to get to know each person to learn who they are, how they wanna be treated, etc. without the weird assumptions that come with the two party gender system. Does this make sense? 

It just makes me really sad that women I know and see online can view queerness as a threat to their fight for equality, or something that can only be true for a few people while others are """"faking it as a trend"""". It makes me scared that I'm gonna get interrogated. Especially after I've been interrogating myself about this in my head for years lol
Has anyone else experienced this? Any recs for if it comes up? I don't just wanna kick people out of my life - I've had similarly problematic thoughts at times in my process, and who's to say some of these people aren't repressing a more complex gender experience of their own?
