2020-08-03 14:16:45,i2xswu,13,1,"Hi everyone!

I (21, AFAB) am currently in the process of questioning my gender. I've been calling myself non-binary for a few years now but I'm wondering if there is more there.

I've always felt more like a guy. When I was young, I got annoyed by ""girly"" things like dolls and instead spent most of my time outside, learning about nature and animals / insects and such. Most of my friends are either non-binary or guys; I don't have any particularly close female friends.

However, I haven't really put any effort into presenting myself in a more masculine way, and I'm not sure that doing so would actually make me happy. I tried growing out my body hair and it just made me uncomfortable (registered as ""disorganized"" in my brain). I did recently cut my hair to chin length which made me extremely happy, even though the haircut itself is rather questionable. I have also been toying around with the idea of shaving my head. I think I would also really, really like a binder, but I am worried about the impact it may have on my chest / lungs. I think I still look feminine enough that when I incorporate more masculine things into my appearance, it just creates inconsistencies and brings attention to my feminine features, if that makes sense. For instance, wearing button-up shirts makes me notice that my chest isn't flat.

Pronouns have been kind of a mess... I don't think I really mind she / her (although certain words, like woman, lady, ma'am, etc. really get under my skin). I think they / them feels most right, but I honestly still think of myself as she / her just because that's what everyone around me uses. I definitely don't actually think of myself as female though.

Hey Folks, I had my T-versary a month ago. 28 Assigned F on testosterone. I'm going to describe a bit of what's going on for me, I'm putting also some medical stuff, because maybe somebody has having same issues. 

Positive first: I enjoyed pretty much all the changes I got and they have been plenty. Voice, bottom growth, lots of body hair, tits deflated and most of their cyst disappeared (bonus: with a custom made bra I have no need to bind, they look like pecs under clothes).  I had muscle and a fair stereotipically masculine shape already but my neck got thicker and my shoulder and torso even wider. I am very happy, I have one wish tho! I hope to grow some beard because I want to grow my hair long and I like to have secondary masculine traits showing, especially in a country where is so unusual to see men with long hair. I was lucky to pass before T and had no much trouble once started, I said goodbye to all that after I started to grow my hair out. Some friends reassure me that whatever the dose I'm doing facial hair will show up eventually, even after 3 years, but they are all binary trans men who do ""standard"" dosage.

I wondered if somebody here had some insight, because looking up online I see only nb people who don't want facial/body hair going on low dose testosterone. 

My endo is on the binary position but in the end she listen to me. I started with two puff of 2% gel with a result of 300 (3?) T level. My E has been the same from pre-T and I kept my period. Due to many reasons - one of them being no op - I prefer to keep it. She wanted me on 3 puff to lower my E, and I gave it a try anyway: I had so important health improvement on T - on 2 puff - but I seem to have bad reactions to 3. Some more blood pressure was life changing for my low blood pressure problem, but on 3 is a bit too much and it mess my heartbeat. I felt sleepy and the only noticeable change was my period disappear on that dosage.

Now of course my heart is more important than a beard. I'm switching back to 2 soon (long story short, different gel give me very different numbers, trying all of them also because there is an eternal problem with T shortage in my country).

I asked the endo about minoxidil, but she's not keen on the product. I know I can buy it on my own, but I also don't feel very at ease just ""try"" since it can mess even more my heartbeat. Am I worrying too much and should try? I have a fair amount of hair on my face, they are still blonde tho!

I started with two puff of 2% gel with a result of 300 (3?) T level. My E has been the same from pre-T and I kept my period. Due to many reasons - one of them being no op - I prefer to keep it. She wanted me on 3 puff to lower my E, and I gave it a try anyway: I had so important health improvement on T - on 2 puff - but I seem to have bad reactions to 3. Some more blood pressure was life changing for my low blood pressure problem, but on 3 is a bit too much and it mess my heartbeat. I felt sleepy and the only noticeable change was my period disappear on that dosage.\n\nNow of course my heart is more important than a beard. I\'m switching back to 2 soon (long story short, different gel give me very different numbers, trying all of them also because there is an eternal problem with T shortage in my country).\n\nI asked the endo about minoxidil, but she\'s not keen on the product. I know I can buy it on my own, but I also don\'t feel very at ease just ""try"" since it can mess even more my heartbeat. Am I worrying too much and should try? I have a fair amount of hair on my face, they are still blonde tho!\n\nTLDR: Can I hope in some beard on low dose T and typical pre-t E? I passed my first year. I would ask what else will change but at this point I think I can expect only more subdle changes.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Changes on low T after first year.

2020-08-08 10:28:30,i5wytc,17,1,"Hey everyone, so since lockdown ive been learning a lot more about genderqueer people, and i get so genuinely excited when doing so, like something just resonates with me.
Ive always been more of a tomboy, and when i was younger i would say i wanted to be a boy when i grow up! In the past few years now (im 21) ive gotten into wearing dresses and pink and floral, but that tomboy side of me is definitely still there.

Ive thought a lot about if maybe im genderqueer, and i feel like it fits me, since looking back on my thoughts/behaviours, it seems to make a lot of sense

I live in Egypt (conservative af) and i have very short hair, so im often confused for a guy, and im ngl i enjoy when that happens. Ive always envied mens' legs and their shape. When im in more boyish clothes i think to myself 'i hope im walking more like a man'

Sometimes i wear dresses, other times i wear more boyish clothes, but i always want to be recognised as being a 'tomboy' even when im in a dress. 

Ive wanted to find the label that fits me best, and speaking to a enby friend, they suggested trying out genderqueer for now since its the umbrella term. I think how I'd best describe myself is: i feel like a mixture of both/ somewhere in between but just embracing one or the other sometimes. However i fully believe that gender differences are made up by society, which gets me thinking more like am i non binary then...?

I have some questions/ thoughts which might seem silly haha but here goes:
1. Am/ can i still be considered genderqueer if i am comfortable in my body as a woman, and also with she/her pronouns?
2. There feels like this pressure to go out and buy more clothes from the mens' section in order to make it more obvious to people that im not fully female. Im trying out they/them pronouns but they feel a little impersonal for some reason. I want a way to make it clear somehow without this pressure.
3.

2020-08-13 01:46:46,i8r0lr,15,1,"These are my thoughts and opinions on masculinity, drawn from my experiences. So take that with a grain of salt. :)

So to begin, I identify as a transmasc woman-presenting person. I feel like a guy by ""default"" when societal expectations aren't in the picture. Some examples include: I had a very tomboy-ish childhood, I always fitted in with the boys but not the girls, I enjoy being in a ""masculine"" profession (engineering), a lot of men's conversations make more sense to me than women's, the list goes on. This isn't to say that women can't do these things, but I find with all these things combined, I feel more like a man than a woman.

 I also do enjoy ""dressing up"" as a woman as if I were performing her identity. It feels like I get to have this brief fantasy where I'm cisgendered and born to be accepted for a brief window of time. I have a very short, feminine body and have found that 1) I get far more social advantages being a short woman and 2) the story/struggle of womanhood is something I want to advance and improve upon, alongside the story/struggle of manhood.

From age 11-20, I expressed my gender to be non-binary or transmasc until I started being comphet (lul) and then from 20-24 I explored my femininity. Now about half a year ago, I'm realizing that I'm really, really missing something and that was my core masculinity.

My current boyfriend met me when I was a pure ABG (lolll) and since then I've changed a lot. For one, my long, silver hair grew tf out and because of quarantine, I've just let my appearance be and to come back to what I was in the years before I tried fitting in so much. I've been worried if that would turn my boyfriend off, but he said he didn't mind so much. So I was very curious why.

Well, we had an interesting discussion on what masculinity \_is\_ to each of us. For him, being from North Vancouver, it meant chopping down trees, driving trucks, fixing cars, being really handy, and knowing how to survive nature and the elements. For me, being from an Viet refugee family, it meant making big decisions, making a lot of money (this being VERY important), having authority and power in your community or company, and having irrefutable opinions about the world.

This relationship has taught me so much about perspective and how culture informs so much. For a lot of our relationship, I would see him through Viet-American lenses and think that he wasn't ""masculine"" enough or that he wasn't trying hard enough, when really in his eyes he was perfectly masculine as a Scot-Canadian. So realizing this has made me appreciate him a lot more.

I imagine that these values served different needs in our cultures--in Viet culture, the idea is, why be handy when you can just hire a bunch people to do it for you? Whereas in North American culture (from what I can tell), the idea is why hire people when you can build or do things with your own raw strength? Viet people are collectivist and generally have not colonized other peoples or lands and so didn't need individual raw grit, strength or survival skills in order to meet their needs.

In terms of being in public together, he wouldn't feel like I was being really masculine because my style of masculinity is aggressive streetwear, which isn't masculine to him. He's more of an organically-torn jeans and gray hoodie guy. Asian masculinity and femininity is less dimorphic than Western, so that's not really surprising to me. He gets the most excited when I present ultra feminine, which while understandable is also disappointing, and that's something I'm still tryna figure out.

So this is all to say that I've experienced a sort of intersectionality in our relationship between sexuality, gender and race that all ends up gelling surprisingly well together. It's not perfect, but it ended up resulting in more tolerance than I expected it to!",genderqueer,Reflecting on masculinity as an Asian afab enby through my relationship with a cishet white male,1597308406.0,"{'created_utc': 1597283206, 'id': 'i8r0lr', 'num_comments': 15, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'These are my thoughts and opinions on masculinity, drawn from my experiences.

So realizing this has made me appreciate him a lot more.\n\nI imagine that these values served different needs in our cultures--in Viet culture, the idea is, why be handy when you can just hire a bunch people to do it for you? Whereas in North American culture (from what I can tell), the idea is why hire people when you can build or do things with your own raw strength? Viet people are collectivist and generally have not colonized other peoples or lands and so didn\'t need individual raw grit, strength or survival skills in order to meet their needs.\n\nIn terms of being in public together, he wouldn\'t feel like I was being really masculine because my style of masculinity is aggressive streetwear, which isn\'t masculine to him. He\'s more of an organically-torn jeans and gray hoodie guy. Asian masculinity and femininity is less dimorphic than Western, so that\'s not really surprising to me. He gets the most excited when I present ultra feminine, which while understandable is also disappointing, and that\'s something I\'m still tryna figure out.\n\nSo this is all to say that I\'ve experienced a sort of intersectionality in our relationship between sexuality, gender and race that all ends up gelling surprisingly well together. It\'s not perfect, but it ended up resulting in more tolerance than I expected it to!', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Reflecting on masculinity as an Asian afab enby through my relationship with a cishet white male', 'created': 1597308406.0}"

2020-08-14 21:36:24,i9uvpm,5,1,"Over the last few days I've been heavily questioning my gender identity. I used to think that I was your typical straight guy until I learned that everyone else was actually actively trying to have sex and romantic relationships. Long story short over the past months I've come to realize that I'm asexual and aromantic. 

I did a lot of soul searching while figuring out my sexual and romantic orientation and noticed that I had internalized quite a lot of toxic masculinity. I also used to subconsciously try to present 'manly' i.e. suppressing emotions, being 'cool' and crap like that. For years I've been in the process of learning that I shouldn't just accept the self image that I feel like society imposes on me and this was a major step forward. 

That was when I started to try and listen to what my inner self actually wanted. Over the course of a few weeks I started shaving my legs and painting my nails and I cut open an old pair of pants to sew myself a skirt.  
I also noticed that I would rather be seen as female because I always thought that males were not supposed to show and talk about feelings while females are (I do realize that this is wrong, I've since then talked about my feelings on multiple occasions and that feeling that I want to be seen as female because of these reasons isn't nearly as strong anymore).

I finally informed myself about the different gender identities and learned that people usually feel a clear connection to their respective gender. The only thing connecting me to my agab was that I was just used to being seen as male. If I was just an immaterial conscience I probably wouldn't have a gender. I also (think I) wouldn't really care if people used she/her pronouns instead of him/his and I feel like they are pretty interchangeable. That's why I decided to use the agender label.

So here's where the confusion begins (anew). I usually like to go commando but I quickly realized that that wasn't going to work with a skirt and male genitals. I was curious and so I bought a pack of panties which I find to be pretty comfortable (definitely more comfortable than male underwear). When I wore panties for the first time I simultaneously felt good because I looked girly and I was extremely self-conscious about my genitals. I'd love to be able to just retract them and have a flat and feminine groin.

That was a few days ago and I've since been thinking about how I feel about my body. I've read a bit about HRT and SRS and while I kinda like the idea of having a more feminine body I'm not 100% sure if I  would want to have medically induced changes. What I do know is that if I had the chance I'd definitely swap my body cause I want to know how it feels to be female and if I prefer that (in your typical ""You can be a different sex for a day, what do you do?"" kind of scenario).

So, dear binary trans folks, how do you know? Do you have a distinct feeling that tells you what gender you are? Am I maybe just curious how it would feel like being female because I've been male all my life? Or maybe a little bit genderflux switching between agender and somewhat female/male?

I’m AMAB— So ever since I was in my teens I’ve had fascination on what it’d be like like to be female. Usually just scratching that interest with light cross dressing or by representing myself online as a female. 

However a couple months ago a cosplayer I follow came out as genderqueer, curious what they meant I looked more into the term, realized that it was along the lines of how I’d felt, and found this sub. From there I read other people’s stories and found myself relating very strongly with a lot of people’s views on this sub. About that same time I began doing more with cross dressing around the home between the times I got home and when she’d get home. 

I’d been struggling hard with wanting to tell her how I really felt, but was not able to work up the courage to tell her. I was fairly sure she’d be okay with the revelation, but that didn’t make it any easier. For weeks i agonized over  working up the nerve to explain it to her.

Finally I got the first couple sentences out leading towards the subject. When she asked if that was a Segway to a subject. When i became hesitant trying to figure out how to explain it, she got really worried that I was coming out as gay or something that could hurt our marriage.

But admitted to what I’ve done at home and that I would try to not even do any of that when she was home, she said it was fine if I wanted to.

The remainder of the drive I was still a bit nauseous. She told me that I don’t need to worry about it any more since I’d told her how I felt and that she was okay with things. I told her it was like getting off a roller coaster. I still needed time to settle from the experience of coming out.

Or is my understanding completely incorrect?\n\nThanks."", 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'I got a question about gender.', 'created': 1597679459.0}"

For example, certain ‘feminine’ things give me this irrational disgust. Like jewellery or nail polish. Hearing or talking about them makes me feel weird. I also dislike any ‘mature’ terms that refer towards a female, such as ‘woman’ or ‘lady’. 

So, those things probably just sound like normal tomboyish things, even though I (sometimes) like to dress in a more feminine style. But recently, things have been a bit different.

It started when one of my friends gave me the idea to make myself look masculine. You’ve probably seen videos where girls put their long hair inside the hood of their hoodie or something, and it looks like they have a more masculine hairstyle. Well, I tried it. And I liked it... a lot. Almost like I wanted to look like that forever. But of course I still wanted to be a girl at the same time. 

I kind of brushed that moment off for about a week, until the other day. I was sitting in my room at night, and I had this sudden urge to ‘be’ a boy. I ended up wearing a cap to look more masculine, but I also really wanted to be referred to as a boy for some reason. I was talking to my friend at the time, and I asked them if they could refer to me as he/him for a while, and if they could use a masculine name. They agreed and, well, it felt really good. I liked being a boy.

It has taken me a few years to understand fully that there really aren\'t any good arguments against being who we are with respect to gender and anatomy, and that peace of mind makes it so I don\'t get flak from people- they are startled at first, and then since I am behaving perfectly normally, everything smoothes out and life goes on! \n\n[Yes, I am a mirl](https://preview.redd.it/iijk421rpyh51.jpg?width=1288&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5346fa4af8654aecd97e725f9febbaf25b4abbc4)\n\nFull disclosure, the exception is with my wife, who really is opposed and even after 5 years does not want to acknowledge my genderfluidity.

2020-08-21 03:54:18,idpl55,37,1,"Hi, my situation is that I am interested in low-dose T, but extremely confused about to what end I want it for. I don't have any close friends who are trans, and talking to my partner just makes me even more confused. I have been spiraling and spiraling recently and can't think about anything else.

Below I describe in a lot of detail where I am coming from, but **the tl;dr is:** *what is the difference in your experience between ""I hate being a woman because of all the things people think being a woman means and want to escape that"" and ""I identify as not-a-woman""?*

Usually a few times a year, I experience days where I utterly loath my body and wish strongly that I had a different one, either androgynous or masculine. This started when I was in 7th grade, when everyone went through puberty, and I could not stand what my body turned into. Especially the growth of my breasts. All I wore for years was super baggy tshirts and oversized fleeces, and bore nonstop vitriol from my mother about not dressing correctly, and was so delighted when anyone thought I was a boy upon first encounter. All I wanted was to look like what the boys around me had suddenly grown into, I felt like they had left me behind.

Sometime in high school, I felt that I more or less grew to accept that this body is the hand I was dealt. And then partway through university, I started to sometimes like what I saw in the mirror. Since I graduated, I have thought about it less and less, but still regularly have days where I know if I don't completely shut the thoughts down right away, they would spiral into an obsession. I never knew about the concept of being trans until late high school, and didn't know about non-binarity until university. My feelings now center much more around how others perceive me and how I go through the world as a woman, I rarely have body dysmorphia anymore.

A few days after I turned 23, I bought a binder, because it marked about 10 years since I started feeling the way I do. It came in the mail a few weeks ago, and I have worn it a few times since.

I was devastated by it - it didn't do anything at all; it flattens my chest a bit, but I look the same. I don't know what I expected, this all is something I rarely let myself think or talk about, and getting a binder felt like such a huge deal to me, and it just. It's just a really tight sports bra. It didn't change anything.

A few nights ago I had a bit of a weepy breakdown talking to a friend about this, who asked if I had ever considered taking T. I had gone on internet dives of looking at people's documentations of their FTM transitions, but I had never considered it for myself, because I don't identify as a man. I also thought I would never pass as anything but what I 'am' - very feminine looking Asian, 5 foot nothing, really curvy for my height, and really round and soft features.

After the thought was in my head though, I just couldn't stop thinking about it. I have also recently followed some people on social media who are genderqueer and present purposefully ambiguously, which I hadn't realized people could do. I live in NYC and I found out that it's comparatively accessible to get on T through Planned Parenthood here. I started looking into booking an appointment, but was still unsure.

I had a conversation with my partner last night where I told him about these feelings. He asked why I wanted to change my body - and I listed all the reasons I didn't like being a woman, a lot of which are about how other people perceive and react to me, and how it affects how I move through the world, and how it affects how I behave in reaction to other people's assumptions. One thing we ended up discussing, which sent me spiraling further, was, the idea of changing your body because of how other people react to you and what other people think. He said, 'isn't that their problem and not yours?', and also that the things I hated about being a woman, all come from the made-up idea of a 'woman' that people have pushed onto me. An analogy he made was, if someone bullied you for your clothes, would you go buy a new wardrobe?

Because I don't experience as much body dysmorphia, my fixation on low-dose T is solely about changing how other people react to me, and not to cure dysmorphic feelings. Though I would love to have my body be more androgynous or masculine, I have long accepted that it is unlikely with my body type. I do agree with many of the things that came up in the conversation with my partner. Afterwards though, I have been struggling with feeling that changing my body to make people treat me different would be because I'm not strong enough to just not care. I am able to shove all these feelings back into a box, from which they will only burst out a few times a year. I just don't know if I should. My instinct is that, if it's just society, maybe the true middle finger to gender is not to transition because of it. But also, I am sometimes miserable how I am.

I know this is really a lot of jumbled thoughts, I just don't know who to talk to about this. I would really appreciate any thoughts from anyone that empathize with any of these feelings!",genderqueer,"I am extremely confused, at the core of everything I cannot figure out for myself what is the difference between ""I hate being a woman and wish I wasn't one"" and ""my gender identity is something-other-than-woman-or-man"".

Never mattered how long or short my hair was, I would time and time again get mistaken for a boy - even if I was wearing a dress! Just two weeks ago I had a man try to prevent me from entering a women's restroom because he thought I was a man; I was wearing a hoodie and daisy dukes and carried a big purse on me, so not exactly traditional masculine clothing. I've also gotten people confused about whether I was a boy or a girl - some were scared to ask while others would jeer from a distance and call me a ""he-she"" or ""tr***y"".

I had considered getting tested for intersex conditions because of my rather non-feminine features, but my genitalia look normal (or at least I think they do?

i'm 20, bisexual and afab. very very recently i have come to realize that i might be genderfluid. ever since i was a child, all of my friends were boys and i always wanted to be considered one of them, and as a kid and early teen, i found much more enjoyment in socializing with boys rather than girls. 

after puberty and sort of ""awakening"" sexually, i started to love my female body; i love having a tiny waist, wide hips, and i love having breasts. i like my feminine features very much, and i like presenting as a woman.

but lately, more and more i've been feeling anguished over the fact that, while i love my female body, i also want to have a male one. i want sooo bad to be a man, to have wide shoulders and tiny hips and a square face; to grow facial hair and have a penis, and the fact that having it both ways isn't physically possible makes me really depressed. 

i like dressing male a lot too--low-hanging jeans, large shirts. my breasts aren't really big so i can bind them with a sports bra pretty easily. sometimes i'll look in the mirror and lean back to expose my hipbones, trying to mimic that V of the male pubis, and the sight of that gives me confidence for like, a microsecond.

i don't want to transition because, as i've said before, i love my body as it is. my sadness stems from the fact that there isn't such a thing as a ""switch"" i can flick to instantaneously switch from a male to a female body. can that feeling be considered dysphoria? i am so confused right now and don't know how to deal with my feelings. i've been watching tutorials of drag king make up and contouring, and i've had to stop mid video because it brought tears to my eyes, the fact that i can't have that bone structure naturally.

i really don't know what to do. therapy isn't really an option for me right now (money is tight; also i'm brazilian and the pandemic here is hitting like the apocalypse) so any words of encouragement or reading reccomendations would be immensely helpful in quieting down this very confusing swirl of emotions inside me.

basically, since about 4th grade (for context, i'm in 11th now) i've had bouts of bottom dysphoria that i would make me upset and that i would vehemently deny because i had no idea what gender dysphoria was, and growing up in a homophobic and transphobic household i would naturally be scared of these things.

I've been questioning myself a lot recently, and generally feeling quite confused. Recently I've been wondering if I'm genderfluid, but I'm not sure if that's really what I am? There's a lot of terms I'm not familiar with, so I'd really appreciate anyone's input on things to research. 
I'm afab, but I've always been quite tomboyish. Generally I've been better friends with boys, and I've always wanted to be considered 'one of the boys'. However, I don't necessarily feel like I want people to use he/him pronouns. 
Really recently, I've been having a lot of days where I want to bind my chest, and generally present more masculine, but again, at the moment I don't feel a strong need for people to use he/him, or they pronouns. 
Some days I want to present more masculine, and some days I want to present more feminine, and there are some days I just feel in-between, but I never feel strongly that I want different pronouns to be used. It's more that I don't really mind what pronouns were used? If someone said he,they, or she, I don't think I'd mind either way.

Hi everyone. 
I’m 23 years old and am AFAB and almost 3 years on T. I pass 100% of the time and have done since I was about 7 months on T. As I’ve become more comfortable with myself I’ve come to realise that sexually I feel more comfortable with my body without any surgery etc. I like having breasts and feel like they are a part of me. Sexually I feel female and am completely happy with that, I’m in a long-term relationship with a pan AFAB person (who isn’t 100% sure on a label but presents as a cis woman), but I feel like the term “lesbian” suits our relationship as it’s a same-sex relationship. To the outside world we’re just another cishet couple but I find that our queerness really cements our relationship and makes me feel happier in an intimate sense. 

Sorry if this is too much of a ramble. I’m not too sure how I feel about everything but I’m beginning to feel like I’m socially Male but in an intimate setting I feel genderqueer or genderless.
