2020-12-04 17:12:45,k6p1gf,1,1,"I've made posts about my experience with emotional incest and my parents... specifically my mother.

I believe that my unhealthy attachment to my mother, to both of my parents, negatively impacted my sexuality and gender...and my whole self.

I am in a heterosexual marriage but I feel like my sexuality is...I don't know? I grew up thinking I was bisexual but then maybe just a lesbian because any time I'd get a crush on a boy I would feel repulsive... and excited? I only wanted to have sex with girls.

When I am around groups of women I feel the need to 'act masculine'. I want to be read as masculine. I don't want to be seen as a 'woman'. I cringe at being called a woman. Now, I actually prefer for people to just use my name and not use 'she/her'. 

I dress similarly to my mother. I've recently only just discovered the style of clothing I would feel most comfortable in and that is more masculine. 

I have a large chest a d this was frequently commented on by my mother growing up as well as others. I do not want top surgery but I do want to be able to wear a t-shirt without a bra.

I don't know how I should feel about all this...because I know it is a result of trauma. I am not transgender. I don't want to be male. I don't want to be read as female? All the time? Maybe only sometimes? I'm sorry...this is so confusing. I like when my older child calls me Mama...but I hate being referred to as a mother because that is womanly. I avoid saying 'my husband's because that makes me a wife and that word is disgusting to me.

When I was pregnant I felt ENTIRELY separate from my body. It's hard to describe. I knew there was a baby growing in me and that was exciting but the fact that my body, my female body, was doing the most female thing made me feel like everyone was staring at me...eyes bulging...judging, disgusted. It felt wrong. My body wasn't supposed to do this...have a baby, be married...I'm disgusting...not a woman.

I definitely don’t like being identified fully as a “women” or a “lady”. “Girl” actually fits way better than those terms but just isn’t completely right. “Non-binary” also sort of fits me but still doesn’t complete me.

2020-12-11 19:08:00,kb91yg,3,1,"Hi all. So recently it has occurred to me that I (21 afab, bi) might not be as cis as was once thought. I'll go into why a bit more in a second but as a TLDR, does anyone have any ideas about places/ways I might try out pronouns/presentation/etc. (pref online bc I'm not really ready to take this irl yet) to see how it feels?

The Why:

It's not that I'm super uncomfortable being seen as a woman; I like dressing a little bit feminine and I'm okayish with my body. She/her doesn't bother me all that much. But something about being called a woman or a girl feels... off. Like it's referring to someone right next to me instead of actually me. I kinda just assumed that was how all women felt for a while until...

I started playing D&amp;D a lot. As a bi person, I never really got to see any fairytales and stuff growing up about people like me, so I have a rule that all my characters are LGBTQ+ . Now, those of you who play D&amp;D know that elements of irl you tend to show up in your characters whether you want them to or not. This is probably why I play so many emo nerds, but that's beside the point. One of my friends I've been playing with for a bit pointed out that I play a lot of NB/GQ characters and the ones that aren't usually have a very loose conception of gender and qualify it at every turn. It hadn't even occurred to me until I started thinking about it and realized that the easiest characters for me to get into were all GQ in some fashion and used they/them, which came sorta naturally to me. So I started messing around with how I presented in other games (avatar stuff mostly) and discovered that I like falling more in a neutral zone than I expected. I wouldn't want to change too much physically irl but there's definitely what I thought was just a butch streak in my ideal style. 

The idea of being something other than a cis woman doesn't bother me really beyond the worry that I might just be misinterpreting something. I just don't know what to call it or how to figure out wtf is going on here. If you made it this far, thanks so much for reading.

Hello,

Yesterday my son* told me he thinks he’s non-binary. I told him I support him whatever or whoever he is. He asked what he should do and I told him he didn’t have to do anything. But I also asked him if he felt like he wanted to do something. He replied that he wanted to explore the matter. I said that that sounded like a good idea and I would seek out resources that he might find helpful or that we could look at together.

If you have any recommendations for resources that he/we might find helpful, I’d really appreciate it. He’s 12. What I would say is a pretty young 12, if that makes sense and matters. That is, he’s very much into kid things like kid-focused anime, video games, etc.

Thank you.

2020-12-13 19:51:10,kchbvh,19,1,"I've been on 10mgs/week subcutaneous. The reason for the low dose is I am on the small side, as well as quite sensitive to medication of any kind. Being nonbinary, I didn't want anything to happen too fast; yall know the deal. 

I'm getting my levels checked this week to see if the doctor's hypothesis is correct that 10mgs for me is not as small a dose as it would be for most. Curious what will be revealed. 

All in all, I really like it so far, and doubt I'll be stopping. In fact, part of me wants to up my dose soon, if the doctor allows, but I think I will give that one more month at least. 

Here's the effects of one month: 

Physical:

\-I'm starting to smell a bit different/more

\-Some slight bottom growth. Not visible but palpable. Orgasms are very different (and much better!) 

\-Got the ""t cold"" immediately, and lost a little bit of my upper vocal range singing in the car. No other perceptible change to my voice. For a couple days, I thought I was going to break every world record for how soon it could crack, but it turned out to just be a coincidental case of bad acid reflux. 

\-I think it increased my appetite a bit, but my depression munchies have gone away, so no net change there, lol. I track nutrition closely and it hasn't been harder than usual to stay at maintenance calories.

\-WATER RETENTION. OH GOD IT IS BAD. I have ibs already, so I'm no stranger to it, but this is on another level. If someone saw me naked and I said I was pregnant, they'd probably believe me. 

\-I've actually felt weaker than usual when working out. I think this is simply because I was overdue for a deload week, which I took. 

\-I feel a sort of body high often, in the few days after the shot when my levels are supposedly highest. I don't think it is a placebo, because I didn't actually want to like t, if I'm being honest. 

\-I'm a little bit oiler. I have a couple zits where my face mask goes- had not happened before. 

Psychological: 

\-Overall, SO MUCH BETTER. I've described it to people thus: ""imagine if your brain was a big, old school clockwork machine that was kind of rusty and clunky, and then you just blasted it with WD-40."" My adhd meds work better. I feel motivated and hopeful even though the pandemic is really bad where I live right now and I'm isolated from my loved ones and all of them are in a very bad place. 

\-The first couple weeks, I did have pretty brutal mood swings. In particular, the day before the second shot was so bad that I'd liken it to a bad acid trip (and I've had several of those). Seems to have stabilized a lot at this point.

\-I feel actually connected with my sexuality for the first time ever. In addition, I've become about 5% more bi per week. I expected this, but don't know where it'll plateau, lol. 

\-In general, feeling more certain of the term ""trans-masculine"" to describe myself. My doubts are leaving me very fast. I'd likely be over them already were it not for the fact that I can't see many other humans currently, and thus am in my own head too much.

I feel like because I haven’t had that experience that maybe I’m just going along with what I’m seeing.

K so I'm really making this too exrated and dirty. It has less to do with what I like and more to do with the fact that I like it.

This is just a reflection of my life experiences in particular my drive and orientation. 
Why do these things matter to a genderfluid transperson? Well I for one would really like to know. Cause I always seem lean towards feminine. And yes that includes transwomen who have functioning equipment. However I was never aware of how to meet such a person. And it seems wrong to just meet for sex. I guess im wierd but I have to like the person, and have an affection gor them, or it's not going to work.

So anyway, never really pursued it to much. But ive always ki da been interested in that, also a transman. For some reason the idea of calling him my daddy, just makes me ridiculously giddy. I do not understand why this appeals to me but not really anything cis manly. Except sometimes there are guys I become attracted too, I don't know why.  It's wierd for me too because I can never tell them. So I don't.

I'm AMAB but I don't feel any connection to it. Being called a man feels weird, like it doesn't give me any dysphoria but I just don't feel any connection in it like my brain instantly reacts with a ""me =/= man"". It's like hearing a person call a spider, an insect; it sounds wrong but I really couldn't care less they used that word. But I don't mind being called a guy but I don't think I would care if people called me a girl or any variation of pronoun.

I did a gender personality test recently and I got almost no masculine and a lot of feminine. And honestly it was not a surprise in the slightest. I have always been pleased with my more tradional feminine qualities, it makes sense to me to be more caring and compassionate and I don't like competiveness, arrogance, assertiveness. I work in a very female dominated career and I like being friends with women and being ""one of the girls"".

This said, I don't know if I feel that feminine, I have my feminine moments but they feel more like just a part of who I am rather than pertaining to gender. As I am not straight, I don't feel like I need to maintain gender roles so I just like what I like. Like I wouldn't mine rocking some black nail polish but only because I like the look.

I'm not really metrosexual or camp, I'm sort of this uncoordinated, unstylish, weird lump who can barely remember to shave my face let alone maintain a more feminine outer personal. I'm not a fan of the girly girl look or the camp gay look. I suppose if I had the choice I would like to have been born a Tomboy. I also really like my tallness, deep voice and my face with a bit of stuble. 

I have bought female clothes for, let's say bedroom reasons but I have started wearing naturally around the house. They feel comfortable and enjoyable but it's not like I don't like my boy clothes (though I find most boy clothes so bland and boring). I also wouldn't wear those clothes out in public as the uncomfortable of worring about people staring would defeat the purpose of my wearing them for my own enjoyment.

It's kind of like when Todd in Bojack describes his asexuality where he says ""maybe I am nothing"". I just don't feel like I have a gender, like I am just me and the things I like are what I like.

2020-12-22 10:55:37,ki3519,4,1,"Hey !


I'm a 17 years old girl (?) who recently came out as lesbian (to… like… myself and a few friends). It has been a pretty overwhelming time, I think it was for everyone, but this wasn't particularly expected (I broke up with my boyfriend… yeah, it was really overwhelming). 

Since then, it has been a few months, and I started questioning my gender identity too. I'm really not sure what, or who, I am anymore, but I don't know if it's a real feeling, or if I'm just being more sensible(?) because of my new found queerness. By the way, I'm sorry for my English, it's not my mother tongue and I am quite ankward with it, I'm scared of not using the correct words.

So yeah, I've never been particularly feminine, neither was I masculine, but it never really bothered me as I know there's a big difference between my gender identity and my gender expression. The thing is, depending on the day, I feel like my body isn't really mine? Like, there are days when I look in the mirror, and I'm like ""gosh my shoulders are so big, I have no hips I look like a man I don't feel good I don't feel pretty"" and then, there are others days where I'm more like ""I'm so small, my hands feel tiny, I feel so rounded and feminine and it bothers me"". Objectively I'd say I have quite a feminine body and a kinda androgynous face, but it still bother me. Those stuff actually make me feel bad about myself, whereas I am usually quite confident. It makes me very self-conscious. I don't know what I should do, but I'm almost thinking of buying a push-up bra and a binder (even though I'm not sure if I have the ""right"" to get one if I'm not trans?) when I'll have my own money. It's a really weird feeling I'm trying to understand but I can't really get around it.
Plus, sometimes, I tell myself I may be doing this for attention? I don't know how to explain it. Especially since I have not tell anyone about those questions... I'm wondering if I really have gender issues or if I'm just not self-confident anymore for some reason?

However, more and more studying revealed that it seems that when some cis people take up the identity of genderqueer what they are typically doing is performing a kind of gender subversion, whereby they identify as a different gender(s), perform different gender roles and the like for the sake of subverting patriarchy, kyriarchy, etc.

I am an AMAB guy who in the last six months or so has been exploring his gender identity in earnest for the first time, after very low-key questioning for basically his whole life. I don't think I'm trans, in the sense that I don't think I am in any sense truly a woman (i.e. having a female mind or spirit), and I don't have any intention of transitioning to living life as a woman.  


I'm really enjoying embracing a more soft or feminine side of myself, wearing skirts and babydoll-cut t-shirts, chunky-heeled boots, different things that I think make me look and feel cute in an androgynous or softboi (or maybe even flatout feminine) sort of way, rather than struggling as I always have previously with both failing to be manly at all, and not wanting to try or succeed at that.

In addition to just clothes, though, I've come to really enjoy wearing fake boobs - silicone breastforms in a pocket bra.... but frankly, I'm still struggling to figure out just what it is I like about it, or what I get out of it, which is why I thought I'd ask here. I figured maybe if I could read your answers it might help me figure out what my answer is. Apologies again if this is a private/personal/awkward sort of question, but: **What do you get out of wearing fake boobs? Why do you like it? What does it do for you, mentally or emotionally?**  


I know that for me, it's:  
\*NOT a sexual fetish sort of thing. Let's get that out of the way first and foremost. I don't get off on merely wearing them, touching them, anything like that.  


\*NOT a coping mechanism for any kind of severe dysphoria. Maybe to a mild extent, yes, I'll admit that. But I imagine that a lot of people (esp. people who unlike myself do identify as transwomen) feel far more strongly dysphoric than I ever have. I don't need to wear them to make myself feel like I'm me, I don't get sad or upset when I'm not wearing them (except, a little bit, maybe, sometimes).  


\*NOT merely, solely, just a fashion accessory, an item of clothing that I would put all the way in the back of the closet until I need it for a particular outfit. I did buy them initially because I thought (correctly) that wearing them would make me feel better about how I looked in certain clothes, that it would help me stop seeing myself as quite so mannish, and start seeing myself as looking good. But it quickly became something more, or something different, from just a utilitarian thing, i.e. that I wear them only because i need them to make an outfit look good; no, I wear them because I like it.

2020-12-29 22:59:31,kmp570,5,1,"So, some background, I am AFAB, but I identify as an androgyne/non-binary. I am masculine of center mostly, but I do have some very feminine qualities and I tend to present in a more feminine way. 

When I was growing up I was raised as a ""girl"" with all the feminine trappings. I was always dressed in dresses, skirt, and frilly things. As a teen I started having some insecurities in my gender identity (although I didn't really realize that was what was going on at the time) and I pretty much refused to wear pants and would dress and present ultra feminine. As I got older I started wearing pants and such, but still very feminine. I felt attractive and people always liked me presenting very feminine and wearing dresses.

A few years back (around 5) I had figured out that I was non-binary/an androgyne. After I figured that out, I started wearing and presenting more masculine than I have, but still strongly leaning towards the feminine. Now I am to the point where I am really uncomfortable wearing skirts and dresses and I am way more comfortable in clothing that is more ""masculine"". I actually like wearing makeup, but other than that, clothing that tend to be associated with femininity makes me feel really uncomfortable. 

Now here is where the problem comes in. So, due to my socialization, culture, and experiences, I feel like I don't look attractive to other people unless I am presenting particularly feminine. When I wear things like skirts and dresses, I get compliments and people tend to treat me kinder/are more friendly. When I wear things like pants, tshirts, tennis shoes, ect. I get weird looks and people are way more stand-offish. I feel like I am perceived as unattractive and people would prefer me to be feminine. I hate that so much of my self-esteem is based in my looks, but after years and years of being in a culture that tends to value that most about AFAB/women/females on their attractiveness has apparently affected me. I feel like I am stuck between feeling attractive and feeling uncomfortable in my presentation/clothing, or feeling unattractive and comfortable in my presentation/clothing.

It's like I wanted a lake cottage in the woods but ended up in a beach house. Sure! The waters right there, but it's not the same.\n\nDoes anyone else feel the same? Dysphoria lite?

Today hasn't been a good head space, after a couple nights of bad dreams, I woke up feeling a little vulnerable and was confronted with clothes from my old life. Seeing tops that I used to fill out that sat on my like I was wearing my dad's clothes, clothes that even though they were huge on me I can remember wearing feeling like a small boy lost inside of. Which in a way I was,  constantly confused and being told that the very things I've come to know make me the person I am were terrible, hurtful things. Being denied female friends just because men shouldn't be friends with girls, I shouldn't want to hang around with girls when now my life is surrounded with trans, gender queer, bisexuality and lesbians.
 Being told no one ever thinks or acts like you  is soul destroying. Thinking your a monster for simply existing and believing it whole heartedly broke me. I'm not ashamed to say I still struggle most days with accepting who I am, some days are made worse when my dreams are so vivid and I have to relive some ofnthe worst times in my life. So how do I cope with my emotions or feelings when my usual defence mechanism of my masculine side is the part that damaged? Or is it really that way around.
