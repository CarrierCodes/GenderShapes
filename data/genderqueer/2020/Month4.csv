Just wanted to preface it saying that I'm very happy a space like this exists, and I'm very glad to be able to learn from you all &lt;3
the question i have today is: does anyone have an idea to modify a chest binder so that it meets the skin underneath the breasts? i made a bad choice of buying a short one instead of a full-top, and with my chest size it just. sticks away from the skin underneath, which bothers me a lot. (i have sensory processing issues, and it makes me unable to wear it, which leads to dysphoria...)
is there a way to pull it together slightly at the bottom, or add some fabric so that it covers my chest area entirely?

Both my gender and my sex are female, but I have this sort of hard to explain feeling. I basically feel like I'm a woman in a man's body, even though I am in fact female. Maybe it's the way society demands certain traits out of women, maybe it's imposter syndrome, but does anyone else have this Russian nesting doll sort of gender experience?

And I don't experience it strongly all the time, most often when I'm around more traditionally ""girly"" women who seem to feel very naturally ""girly""

(There are a lot of societal expectations of womanhood meaning being perfect, too, which I think may also factor in)

Also, I'm bi, and I find myself feeling more masculine when I feel attracted to said traditionally ""girly"" women, which might just be internalized heteronormative roles?

2020-04-05 23:12:45,fvnjbt,5,1,"I've gladly been part of the LGBTQ+ community for almost a decade now through discovering my sexuality, but only recently have I been even more involved in the gender side of it all. My girlfriend came out as trans within the past few months, so naturally I've simply become more aware of new ideas and what else is out there to identify as. I knew what non-binary was before all of this, but very loosely. I never fully understood what it meant at the time, as I was still fairly young when originally learning about the entirety of the LGBTQ+ community, but just the other day I was doing one of those, ""I want to understand her side, too"" obsessive research moments in hopes to find ways to help her be more comfortable as herself. Shortly after, I found myself going down a rabbit hole of all sorts of terms that I never understood in the beginning, landing myself back at non-binary.

The difference between me back then and me now is that I somewhat understand what it means now as compared to before and I've become more self-aware in the world as is in regard to how I feel about myself. Back then, I never considered it at all. Now it's torn my life apart for almost 3 days straight as I question my entire being and whether I'm really cis or not.

HERE'S THE GOOD PART: I think I might be somewhere on the spectrum of gender, but I'm so insanely confused about where I actually belong, or if I do at all. I'm born afab and have been raised as a ""girl,"" but I've never felt truly connected to those types of words to describe myself. Woman does not feel 'me' enough, but neither does man. I guess the best way to describe it is that I just feel... like nothing? A cloud? A glass of water? After a few days of stressing over it all, I can only comfortably say that I am not cis, but not what I actually identify as. It's less-so what I am, but what I'm not at this point.

I don't hate feminine pronouns, but male ones wouldn't hurt either, nor would neutral ones. I've come to realize that when I was first getting into the community, I wasn't completely comfortable in being a girl, either; It's not something that has just now started apparently. I remember going through what I thought was a phase of wanting to try binding (Never went through with it out of fear. I now regret not having tried once.), trying to wear more 'masculine' clothing, and just simply not feeling like I was myself. I've been able to ignore it all for years up until now. Since then, I have somewhat found a style that I enjoy that's not necessarily masculine or feminine or even androgynous? (I know it's horrible to think that nb people have a ""style,"" but that's one major reason as to why I'm so confused.)

I don't feel *not* cis enough to be called anything but cis, but I still don't feel like whatever being a woman means. It may be just a result of my mental health issues, but I can't stop finding reasons as to why I'm just faking everything. I don't think I'm particularly as dysphoric about things as ""real"" non-cis people are. Obviously, I don't like my chest, I don't like my monthly visits of the annoying, freeloading cousin Stan, I don't like things like my jaw line or voice in recordings, but it's not bad enough for me to count it as what I see people explaining as dysphoria. I would absolutely be happy if transplants for those things were possible to give my girlfriend (or honestly anyone else) the parts that I don't want, though.

I don't really know how to go about figuring out where my place is in terms of gender. I'm trying to get my friend group to try changing the pronouns they use for me to they/them to see how I feel about that, but nobody in the group really uses pronouns as a whole, we just say things and hope the right person is listening. I'm interested in getting my hair cut to something pretty neutral, but there are... obvious reasons as to why that can't happen until further notice! A name change/nickname (Alexis is nice. Neutral, similar to birth name, favorite letter x is in there.) would be fun to try too, but again, nobody in my group really use names when we talk to each other so I can't see it having any impact if it won't really be used much. I would love any suggestions and am welcome to DM's if anyone is interested in helping further, or maybe even questioning themselves and just need someone to resonate with.

My girlfriend came out as trans within the past few months, so naturally I\'ve simply become more aware of new ideas and what else is out there to identify as. I knew what non-binary was before all of this, but very loosely. I never fully understood what it meant at the time, as I was still fairly young when originally learning about the entirety of the LGBTQ+ community, but just the other day I was doing one of those, ""I want to understand her side, too"" obsessive research moments in hopes to find ways to help her be more comfortable as herself. Shortly after, I found myself going down a rabbit hole of all sorts of terms that I never understood in the beginning, landing myself back at non-binary.\n\nThe difference between me back then and me now is that I somewhat understand what it means now as compared to before and I\'ve become more self-aware in the world as is in regard to how I feel about myself. Back then, I never considered it at all. Now it\'s torn my life apart for almost 3 days straight as I question my entire being and whether I\'m really cis or not.\n\nHERE\'S THE GOOD PART: I think I might be somewhere on the spectrum of gender, but I\'m so insanely confused about where I actually belong, or if I do at all. I\'m born afab and have been raised as a ""girl,"" but I\'ve never felt truly connected to those types of words to describe myself. Woman does not feel \'me\' enough, but neither does man. I guess the best way to describe it is that I just feel... like nothing? A cloud? A glass of water? After a few days of stressing over it all, I can only comfortably say that I am not cis, but not what I actually identify as. It\'s less-so what I am, but what I\'m not at this point.\n\nI don\'t hate feminine pronouns, but male ones wouldn\'t hurt either, nor would neutral ones. I\'ve come to realize that when I was first getting into the community, I wasn\'t completely comfortable in being a girl, either; It\'s not something that has just now started apparently. I remember going through what I thought was a phase of wanting to try binding (Never went through with it out of fear. I now regret not having tried once.), trying to wear more \'masculine\' clothing, and just simply not feeling like I was myself. I\'ve been able to ignore it all for years up until now.

Hi, all!

I have decided that it's time to buy a binder. I don't necessarily need to look completely flat, and so far I've just been using sports bras to make me look flatter. The effect is *okay*, but it gives my chest that 'pushed-up' look that I do NOT like. This is what I am hoping to fix by buying a binder. But how would I even go about buying a binder that doesn't make me look completely flat? I mean, I wouldn't mind that, but I have an idea that a looser one would be more comfortable to wear, and having a slightly bigger chest would be worth it, I think.

My challenge here is, I have to buy it online and I'm very insecure are choosing the size without having the possibility of trying it on in real life. I just feel at a loss having to do all this online. Especially bc I'm a bit particular about the style too.

I just got dumped on Sunday by the most amazing bi-woman on the planet. She was the first partner I ever had that made me feel seen as genderqueer and not only accept me for it, but love me and make me feel attractive as my true self. 

Part of the problem, and why she ended it, was like I was previously in a marriage with a cis hetero woman who was fairly emotionally abusive (because of their childhood trauma) and about 4 years into the marriage I tried to slightly come out as genderqueer. I admitted I sought out androgynous clothing and preferred to wear underwear designed for women. 

I didn't really get into the other parts of my gender, because honestly I can't put words to them. I tried to explain it to a friend once as, when I listen to albums by women I connect with them deep in my soul or some other trite and confusing explanation, but shortly after halfway coming out, she left me. It was out of left field and I was crushed. 

I processed the divorce but not really the underlying trust issues. So in this relationship that just ended (after a little over a year), I wasn't the best partner as they were suffering from a disorder that would often cause them to be depressed to the point of having little to no energy. They told me this early on and I accepted them for it. Unfortunately, I couldn't help but take it personally when they would need space, or boundaries or take a long time (half a day to day sometimes) and would push for more time. I never really explored WHY I did this and just assumed it was normal for a couple to need to work on the amount of time they spent together. She referred to my need for togetherness and her need for space as a fundamental issue. 

When i'd feel like wearing a dress or any other non-gender conforming clothing she actually seemed just as attracted to me as when I wore gender conforming clothing. She even helped me do makeup for the first time in my life for Halloween which was just the best feeling in the whole world. We were the same size and she'd even let me try on some of her clothes, which was so nice since buying clothes in stores is terrifying and online is such a shit show. I even got to wear one of her dresses around er roommates and one of their boyfriends and nobody minded. It felt so amazing I can't even begin to describe it. 

I was bullied a ton in high school, constantly called a fag, beaten up, just really not a great time (including a failed sleep pill suicide attempt), so it's super hard for me to put this out there. 

Honestly this only like the second time I've even put it out there on Reddit.

So I'm mourning not just a great relationship with an amazing partner, but the first time in my entire life I've felt like my true self and I have no idea how long it'll take before I'm back there. I accept myself but I'm not sure I'll ever feel comfortable in public alone as myself. I had a safe place to interact with others and now it's gone. I can't even tell her about this because I don't want to make her feel guilty for ending a relationship in which I was not being a good partner at all in terms of respecting and supporting her mental health.

2020-04-12 01:02:37,fzn136,7,6,"Hello there!

I'm an AMAB individual. A lot of days, I am completely comfortable and happy in my assigned gender, and others I just wish I was born a cis female. Sometimes, I'm not so sure, and feel like maybe a mix.

At first, I thought I was just a cis male crossdresser, but it became apparent to me that it was beyond that. Then I starting doing research online into the gender spectrum. For a long time now, I've considered the possibility of being (strictly) trans, but the problem with that is that I don't *always* feel that way.

So, sometimes I'm more cis male, others, I'm more trans female. I'm kinda tired of going through labels, trying to find one that fits, but I feel like I'm finally zeroing in on what actually fits me. So, would I be genderfluid and/or bigender? As far as pronouns go, ""he/him"" or ""she/her"" feel good. I guess I just want a term or set of terms to point to when I come out to people, like ""Hey, I wanted to tell you that I'm \_\_\_\_\_"", you know?

Lastly, I'm afraid to come out to anybody I know, but it's kinda slowly eating me alive. Most people around me are very narrow-minded about gender. I only have one friend I could possibly trust about it, and I've known him for many years. Everyone else I know would mostly likely be unsupportive, and I'm not exactly sure about the one friend I mentioned either. He's very accepting for the most part, but he doesn't think trans people should get mad for being misgendered if they don't pass, which is pretty rude. I have no idea what he thinks about genderqueer or non-binary people either.

So, I guess the question is, what best describes me and where do I go from here?

Then I starting doing research online into the gender spectrum. For a long time now, I\'ve considered the possibility of being (strictly) trans, but the problem with that is that I don\'t *always* feel that way.\n\nSo, sometimes I\'m more cis male, others, I\'m more trans female. I\'m kinda tired of going through labels, trying to find one that fits, but I feel like I\'m finally zeroing in on what actually fits me. So, would I be genderfluid and/or bigender? As far as pronouns go, ""he/him"" or ""she/her"" feel good. I guess I just want a term or set of terms to point to when I come out to people, like ""Hey, I wanted to tell you that I\'m \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_"", you know?\n\nLastly, I\'m afraid to come out to anybody I know, but it\'s kinda slowly eating me alive. Most people around me are very narrow-minded about gender. I only have one friend I could possibly trust about it, and I\'ve known him for many years. Everyone else I know would mostly likely be unsupportive, and I\'m not exactly sure about the one friend I mentioned either. He\'s very accepting for the most part, but he doesn\'t think trans people should get mad for being misgendered if they don\'t pass, which is pretty rude. I have no idea what he thinks about genderqueer or non-binary people either.\n\nSo, I guess the question is, what best describes me and where do I go from here?

So I was pretty sure I'm genderfluid, however...

A lot of times people describe their gender fluidity as what sounds like a switch being turned off and on. I see this example a lot ""I'll wake up in the morning as a woman, put on a cute outfit, walk out the door and suddenly I'm uncomfortable cause I'm a man in a skirt.""

For me, I've never felt like that. When it comes to the idea of gender (and I admit I absolutely have fragmented and damaged pieces of my psyche that might contribute to that), I can't ever really firmly say ""I feel like a man"" or ""I feel like a woman"" or ""I feel like A or B.""

I feel like... I'm me. That's all I can describe it as.

I have times where I absolutely present as a woman and think in a way as a woman in terms of social, sexual, clothing and other avenues. There are other times where I feel masculine, and start thinking in different ways, in terms of social, sexual etc.

I never learned any of those hard lines of demarcation in terms of expression. I can't use makeup past extremely elementary basics. Because of a physical condition I do sprout longer hairs on the underside of my neck and sometimes I let these grow out just because it makes me more comfortable when my masculine side gets more prevalent.

But I don't know if that's the literal term of genderfluid, or if I'm just something else that enjoys wearing men and women's clothing. I thought I had an identity but I don't feel like so many other people describe it as so, call it a mild identity crisis.

If I'm not GF, any idea what I could be?

So this is the first time I've really said this but I always felt like I never really identified as male. I still don't know if I'd consider myself nonbinary or genderfluid or what, but yeah. For a while I've really wanted for other people to know about this, because whenever I'm referred to as male in any way I just get extremely uncomfortable about it.

I sort of have a reputation for being quiet, like I have social anxiety and often go entire days without talking to anyone. I don't have many close friends (well I used to but none of them lasted), but there are a few groups of people that generally accept me and let me talk to them. They're really supportive, but I don't know if we're really friends yet.

Basically my problem is this... I really want to tell somebody about my gender identity because it's so uncomfortable having people mislabel me every day.

If you're asked what your gender is and you tell someone you are ""non-binary"", what exactly do you mean by that? I consider everyone non-binary, because gender is a spectrum, not a binary, but I don't understand why (or if) people use the term non-binary to describe their gender experience or just their ideology.

To me ""non-binary"" also implies that other genders are binary, which is wrong according to modern gender theory. What are your thoughts? Is language still evolving here?

[I am 16, AFAB and queer (not straight)]

‚Ä¢Now i know (if anyone actually comments here) everyone is gonna tell me that ""it's not a choice to be genderqueer/nb"" and I KNOW! But hear me out (I've been questioning for months now).

‚Ä¢When i was in middle school and i started realizing i wasn't straight, i also started dressing like male singers i was a fan of (aka dressing more ""masculine"") and i liked it! Because i had no idea people expected me to ""dress like a girl"", therefore, I thought that my parents didn't like it so I stopped after a few months of dressing like that (worth mentioning: in this stage i started getting into the LGBTQ+ community, and i genuinely thought i was gender fluid for a few months, but later dismissed it)

‚Ä¢A few years later (now), I'm REALLY into fashion (unisex fashion, if that changes anything), fashion design and art in general, you may be asking ""what does this have to do with being GQ?"", well....Coincidentally 95% of people I follow for fashion and design inspiration on Instagram are non-binary (mostly AFABs), and when I found this out, I thought it was so cool to be free from gender roles and ""rebel"" against this cisheteronormative world: to just ""look like a girl"" (in the eyes of cisheteronormative society) but not feel like one; to look androgynous, so people have no idea what gender to assign you; to wear whatever you want, without having to prove your gender.

‚Ä¢I want to be a part of that world so bad, because being a ""woman"" and being treated as one feels way too limiting for me (same goes with being a ""man"", which i haven't even thought of, because it doesn't feel right for me).
On the internet i present myself as she/they, because i'm not 100% sure about they/them pronouns.

‚Ä¢Basically I just wanna be free from the gender roles and cisheteronormativity that comes with being a girl, including the fact that women are CONSTANTLY being sexualized by society (men mostly), but i'm scared that i'm just influenced by the nb people i follow and i wanna be like them.

‚Ä¢Also I'm Spanish, and we don't have gender-neutral pronouns such as they/them, therefore it would be a LOT harder for me to tell my loved ones to refer to me with gender-neutral pronouns.

CLARIFICATION: i know that it's not like nb/GQ people wanna ""feel special"", because they're born like that, but i'm scared i wanna be nb because i wanna be ""not like most people"", i don't know how to explain this.

EDIT (WORTH MENTIONING): Because i wanna look fairly androgynous while still wearing both ""boy AND girl clothes"", i have decided that i don't really like my chest, but i don't wanna completely get rid of it (i just wish i had a smaller chest), so i wanna get a binder (for now i can't get it because i can't get a job and i cant ask my parents for it either), so that's that.",genderqueer,"I wanna be genderqueer/non-binary because i'm tired of the expectations/gender roles that comes with being a woman, but i'm scared that i just wanna be ""special"".",1587160445.0,"{'created_utc': 1587135245, 'id': 'g33hwc', 'num_comments': 38, 'score': 21, 'selftext': 'LONG POST!!\n\n[I am 16, AFAB and queer (not straight)]\n\n‚Ä¢Now i know (if anyone actually comments here) everyone is gonna tell me that ""it\'s not a choice to be genderqueer/nb"" and I KNOW!

Hi. I‚Äôm AFAB, and my wardrobe is mostly shirts and pants. No problems there. I‚Äôve been gender questioning for a while though. (That‚Äôs a can of worms I‚Äôll probably post here or some other nb subreddit soon.) 

Starting with last year, buying a men‚Äôs jacket (not visibly/obviously, the store associate mentioned it offhandedly when talking about fit, and I tensed up at the thought). I thought I looked masculine in it, and I really liked it. For a short while my dresses and jumpsuit felt like a betrayal. I didn‚Äôt look much manlier but it just felt nice. Nowadays any gender association with that jacket has diminished. 

After that, I started to swing back and forth. It‚Äôs less I wanna look masc or femme, it‚Äôs more like sometimes I want a jumpsuit/romper, sometimes I explicitly don‚Äôt. Sometimes (a lot of the time) I don‚Äôt care. Wearing the jacket generally was a masc day, church (because I normally wear dresses) was a femme day. 

The thing that confuses me is this one black tee I have. Plain, female tee with a shirt pocket. When i wear this shirt, I think ‚ÄúI could be called he/him in this shirt.‚Äù Outside this shirt, that pronoun tends to feel weird. 

Is this odd? That my shirt could change my idea of my pronouns?? (Honestly, how are you certain you‚Äôre not cis to begin with?)

not looking for medical advice, just wondering if anyone else was in the same position as me and wondered what were some of the deciding questions that led you to your decision to get/not get top surgery. full disclosure, it's been something that's been on my mind for months, but i've started seriously thinking about it in the last week or so. i'm genderqueer (? considering agender as a label that might feel more comfortable atm but that's neither here nor there). 

so, a big part of my dysphoria revolves around my chest. it impacts how comfortable i feel when i'm being intimate (even though my partner is super cool about asking/following my requests if i don't want to be touched there), how comfortable i feel in my clothes, and because of this, i've started heavily considering top surgery in the last little bit. my only real\* point of concern is that sometimes i do like my chest, but it's usually when i'm alone that this happens. like i don't fully hate my chest, but i'm pretty unhappy with it in the majority of scenarios. whenever i think about myself, (which i tend do do a lot -- i'm an actor and i think about different roles in theatre i want to play) i never see myself with my chest, and generally put myself in more gender neutral/masculine positions. i also realize my chest might affect my ability to exist in the world the way i so desperately want to.  


at the same time, i also don't bind often. i have pretty bad ocd/anxiety regarding safety and it's not worth it to risk a panic attack when i have a binder on for me. i do wear a lot of compressive sports bras and thoroughly enjoy how i look when i wear them, but also can't help but remember that means i don't have a flat chest. 

if anyone has any advice or thoughts you had or questions you asked yourself, i would appreciate that a lot! if anyone also has any more neutral-leaning/non-binary articles that discuss top surgery, i would also love to read those! thanks for reading

-I can't go back to my teen years and experience a normal male puberty.

-I can't have a functional penis that works just like cis-penis. I don't trust the current phalloplasty/metoidioplasty approach.

-There are certain things transitioning can't change. my height, my bone structure, body shape and jaw line cannot change.

-My transphobic (lgbt-phobic actually) will never accept me. I came out to them 8 years ago. It didn't work well ""at all"", to the point that I went back into the closet and I'm still there.


Anyways, I would be more than happy if there was a surgical option/magic pill/etc that could make me a guy, or If I was born again as a cis-guy. but I can't trust the current methods.

I also at this *same time* imagined myself suave and cool, like a ‚Äúbad boy,‚Äù in a leather jacket, catching all the ladies, smooth, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry baby, I‚Äôll take care of you,‚Äù with a mischievous smile, and a motorcycle. 

And this was pretty much at any given time. And I‚Äôm not talking about like, my dreams for my future. I‚Äôm talking about *I fully expected this to be my adult self, all three of these, simultaneously*. I didn‚Äôt think about the idea that being a suave leather jacket character contradicted with being a fluffy sparkly princess or with being barefoot and pregnant with my 6th child. 

I do remember struggling with loving girly things and feeling frustrated because I *felt* like a ‚Äútomboy‚Äù in a lot of ways but I believed I couldn‚Äôt describe myself as one because I also liked really girly things and wearing pretty dresses.

Oh, and ya‚Äôll, this is the funniest part to me but unrelated to gender- despite having this image in my head of being some kind of smooth operator for the ladies as an adult, *it didn‚Äôt click for me that I was in fact bi until I was 23 years old* despite the fact that I never forgot that I‚Äôd had that aspiration, I even went through a short time in high school where I wanted to be a motorcyclist covered in leather and recalled my interest in the style itself, and later as I started college chuckled to myself when I recalled it, thinking, ‚Äúhah, that‚Äôs so funny I would have imagined myself that way, I‚Äôm not even into girls.‚Äù .__________.

I don‚Äôt know how I would label myself. I feel very feminine and I definitely don‚Äôt have gender dysphoria. I just feel like a tomboy princess, if that makes sense? I wouldn‚Äôt want to be clocked as a guy, although it doesn‚Äôt offend me when young kids misgender me due to shorter hair and more dude-ish clothes and no makeup- it might offend me a little bit if adults did, unless I cut my hair the way I‚Äôm planning to and happen to not wear makeup and to dress a bit more comfortable that day(in which case it wouldn‚Äôt bother me one bit). 

I don‚Äôt know, I didn‚Äôt expect to deal with any level of gender confusion at age 25. 

Do I even have to label myself? Like I‚Äôm so cool with being born a girl, and being always perceived as one, I‚Äôm not sure what to think of this. I just want to be me and to be able to express my masculine side as a feminine woman.
