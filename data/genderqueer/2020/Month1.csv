After spending so much of my life being angry and upset at my relationship to masculinity, I finally cracked open the HRT question with my therapist. And here we are two years in, the first being just spiro  and the second a rising dose of estrogen. 

I honestly can’t really afford to nuke the facial hair. I toy with the idea but i have other Unfortunate financial realities I need to confront. 

My best friend is trans and I feel like such a colossal fuckup in comparison. Because I am kinda stumbling into being an outright queered up genderfuck. 

I’m happy with some of the physical and emotional changes hrt brought. I had the sex drive of a potato before so I don’t miss it. 

It’s just, today, I was out at the museum and saw my reflection in a glass case, from a funny angle, and was kinda jaw dropped at the way I looked, just, my cans looked kinda huge, and I don’t know what that struck me so hard but it did. 

I love my boobies but at the same time I feel guilty having them. I feel guilty and ashamed that I’m not together enough to make the push Into real female passing, although for -anyone- else I’ll die on the sword the passing is a tyrannical oppressive expression of patriarchally enforced binarism. 

But for me I just. It hurts and I won’t let myself exist in this liminal gender space. I feel so upset and sad and hurt that I can’t make myself into a woman. And how hard that makes it to relate to people. My best friend, who has been so supportive, still struggles with me as a transfemme but not passing woman. I don’t blame her but sometimes it can be difficult to cope with her offloaded anxieties as she tries to fill me in on the course, at least the one she took. 

Part of me wishes I could have just been happy as a man but I tried for 40 years to do that. I just now have to live with not being a woman. In a world that barely understand that trans people exist let alone have nuanced conversations about binarism and passing and not-passing. 

I’m sorry if I’ve lost the plot I’ve just, I’m tipping to a point I can’t enter control what people see of me, something I’ve tried all my life to do, and it’s half liberating, all terrifying. 

For all the silliness I just wish I had a squishy life partner to have these moments with. Someone to call me their girlfriend, no matter how broken-male I present. 

Maybe it’s stupid to wish for someone to understand me when I can’t understand myself.

Because I am kinda stumbling into being an outright queered up genderfuck. \n\nI’m happy with some of the physical and emotional changes hrt brought. I had the sex drive of a potato before so I don’t miss it. \n\nIt’s just, today, I was out at the museum and saw my reflection in a glass case, from a funny angle, and was kinda jaw dropped at the way I looked, just, my cans looked kinda huge, and I don’t know what that struck me so hard but it did. \n\nI love my boobies but at the same time I feel guilty having them. I feel guilty and ashamed that I’m not together enough to make the push Into real female passing, although for -anyone- else I’ll die on the sword the passing is a tyrannical oppressive expression of patriarchally enforced binarism. \n\nBut for me I just. It hurts and I won’t let myself exist in this liminal gender space. I feel so upset and sad and hurt that I can’t make myself into a woman. And how hard that makes it to relate to people. My best friend, who has been so supportive, still struggles with me as a transfemme but not passing woman. I don’t blame her but sometimes it can be difficult to cope with her offloaded anxieties as she tries to fill me in on the course, at least the one she took. \n\nPart of me wishes I could have just been happy as a man but I tried for 40 years to do that. I just now have to live with not being a woman. In a world that barely understand that trans people exist let alone have nuanced conversations about binarism and passing and not-passing. \n\nI’m sorry if I’ve lost the plot I’ve just, I’m tipping to a point I can’t enter control what people see of me, something I’ve tried all my life to do, and it’s half liberating, all terrifying. \n\nFor all the silliness I just wish I had a squishy life partner to have these moments with. Someone to call me their girlfriend, no matter how broken-male I present. \n\nMaybe it’s stupid to wish for someone to understand me when I can’t understand myself.\n\nPardon the self indulgent dump, I just needed to throw this message in a bottle out somewhere where somebody might resonate with it, and talking into my phone is, ya know, feels sorta safer. \n\nThanks for listening.

2020-01-04 06:39:56,ejt3ly,1,6,"A few weeks ago, I had made a promise to myself to come out in the new year. And I actually did! On New Year's Day, I put up a post on Facebook informing all my Facebook friends that I'm NB/GF/GQ and ace. I didn't just come out of the closet—I leapt out of it headfirst without a parachute.

And I don't regret it even the tiniest bit. The amount of acceptance and validation from my friends was overwhelming! Many of my friends didn't say anything, not even a default FB reaction, but the multitudes of those who validated my choice was absolutely rewarding!

There's still two hurdles to jump, though. First, tomorrow evening my local friends are having a get-together which will be the first time I've interacted with any of them since coming out. I don't expect trouble, but a few of those I know will be there are among those who didn't acknowledge my post and who I know are not likely to approve. I'm not planning to rub anyone's nose in it—I'm not going overboard on the queering—but I do hope that this doesn't hurt any of those friendships.

The second hurdle is with my family. Some of my more distant relatives (cousins and such), and the bulk of my spouse's family, were among those who eagerly validated my choice. But among my immediate family, only my brother-in-law reacted (he's cool with it). In particular, I've seen no reaction from my sister. My father's in a nursing home (no, I'm not going to try to explain it to him), and my mother's not on FB. So I will have to deal with my sister and my mother not knowing how they will/do take this.

On the one hand, my sister has been part of the local theatre community for years, so people who push the gender and sexuality boundaries are nothing new or repellent to her. But dealing with the idea that her younger brother isn't simply her brother anymore has got to be difficult for her to deal with. And I'm concerned that if she's taking it badly, that will affect how my two nieces (her daughters) will take it.

As for my mother, I genuinely have no idea how she will handle it. Part of me suspects she'll passively refuse to acknowledge it, because that's how she has dealt with both my and my sister's psychological issues (depression, anxiety, ADD, and, for me, Asperger's Syndrome). But another part of me thinks she may actively react badly, and a smaller part of me is hoping that she'll be okay with it, probably not immediately but after some discussion and thought. After all, she  noticed when I will little how I enjoyed playing with my sister's toys as much as with my own, and didn't discourage me from that. So maybe she's more open to that than she is to mental health disorders.

I have heard that there will be rounds of therapy that are required  for each phase (hormone treatment, then surgery) before a Dr will start ... is this true? I’d like to understand what that might look like.

We are already using the female pronouns and have looked into the legalities of the name change so that part is clear and we are currently looking into whether his parents’ health care will cover it.

2020-01-05 19:13:40,ekhhzn,4,1,"I feel like I've definitely felt gender dysphoria ever since I started questioning my gender identity a few months back. I'm AMAB I've recently taken up a feminine name and she/her pronouns, and it's really made me feel better. So far I've been id'ing as transfemme/demigirl for the most part as I don't wholly identify with being a woman, just with femininity though. I had a dream today where I was a male and I was hanging out with my crush, though I have no intention whatsoever to pursue this relationship irl. She doesn't really know that I've been questioning my gender identity and such, and that's why I feel that when I do dream about her, I'm always a guy.  


Any who, I always wake up from dreams like those feeling happy despite it being my male self. After thinking about the dream and thinking of my self as male in hypothetical situations, I feel that there are aspects of my male identity that I'm happy with. I feel that is probably the main reason why I haven't experienced dysphoria until I was 22 (I'm 23 now) as I was content with a part of my gender identity. I also think this is a reason why I still don't mind wearing men's clothing (and be okay with it being a bit feminine). I did try *some* women's clothes and I really didn't ""feel anything"" to be frank. I think this is also another reason why I find it so hard to express my gender the way I want to, because there are masculine aspects of myself that I can't seem to let go while trying to see myself as female. 

I was thinking if maybe I see myself as male in some aspects and female in others? I don't really experience bottom dysphoria, but I do experience social dysphoria if someone calls me he/him instead of she/her. That's why I seem myself as a transfemme/demigirl rather than me being fully a woman as there are male aspects of myself I can't deny despite identifying myself with femininity. I've been thinking of a label such as bigender as there are male aspects I like of myself despite me having an affinity of ID'ing myself as female. I still like to imagine myself as a male at time too. Though, I don't know if that's wholly accurate to say that I'm bigender however. As I essentially am okay with thinking of myself as a male and female, but I prefer telling people I'm a female. Sometimes I wonder if it's just femininity I identify with rather than being *actually* female which is why I might like she/her pronouns better than he/him ones.  


Right now the biggest problem I face is the gender dysphoria I experience because I'm not sure how to express my own gender physically irl in the way I want to in a way that represents my gender identity. Perhaps something that represents both femininity and some masculinity too. I've tried woman's clothing and it didn't really sit right. I always wear male clothing, but it doesn't make the dysphoria go away either. This is why I'm really confused.  


Anyone have some ideas and could share some thoughts on this?

I feel that is probably the main reason why I haven\'t experienced dysphoria until I was 22 (I\'m 23 now) as I was content with a part of my gender identity. I also think this is a reason why I still don\'t mind wearing men\'s clothing (and be okay with it being a bit feminine). I did try *some* women\'s clothes and I really didn\'t ""feel anything"" to be frank. I think this is also another reason why I find it so hard to express my gender the way I want to, because there are masculine aspects of myself that I can\'t seem to let go while trying to see myself as female. \n\nI was thinking if maybe I see myself as male in some aspects and female in others? I don\'t really experience bottom dysphoria, but I do experience social dysphoria if someone calls me he/him instead of she/her. That\'s why I seem myself as a transfemme/demigirl rather than me being fully a woman as there are male aspects of myself I can\'t deny despite identifying myself with femininity. I\'ve been thinking of a label such as bigender as there are male aspects I like of myself despite me having an affinity of ID\'ing myself as female. I still like to imagine myself as a male at time too. Though, I don\'t know if that\'s wholly accurate to say that I\'m bigender however. As I essentially am okay with thinking of myself as a male and female, but I prefer telling people I\'m a female. Sometimes I wonder if it\'s just femininity I identify with rather than being *actually* female which is why I might like she/her pronouns better than he/him ones.  \n\n\nRight now the biggest problem I face is the gender dysphoria I experience because I\'m not sure how to express my own gender physically irl in the way I want to in a way that represents my gender identity. Perhaps something that represents both femininity and some masculinity too. I\'ve tried woman\'s clothing and it didn\'t really sit right. I always wear male clothing, but it doesn\'t make the dysphoria go away either. This is why I\'m really confused.  \n\n\nAnyone have some ideas and could share some thoughts on this? I would wholly appreciate it as I\'m pretty lost on this at them moment.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'What would make sense as a description in light of my gender identity?

So I have always been into more masculine things since I was young. Don’t get me wrong I did play with dolls but also trucks. I was a huge superhero, Star Wars and sports fan (still am). I played football and rugby as a kid and into my teens. I really feel like I act like a guy. I have always been hyper competitive, loud, aggressive, I always was in charge as a kid when play games. I’m very vocal and dominate. Wrestling with the boys was always more fun than playing house as a kid. 

At age 4. I do this thing with my hair where I twist it and used to rip it out. So my mom shaved off all my hair. I remember me refusing and her tempting me with a new toy if I did it. So I did and it was freeing. I had lots of hats like my bald dad because our heads got cold, this made me feel closer to him. And at 4 kids don’t judge if u have hair or not. 

Cut to now I always have my hair tied up because I hate it in my face. I hate how long it takes to blow dry, how if I air dry it i looked like I’ve been electrocuted, how my head is always adored with a crown of long frizzy baby hairs that won’t stay no matter what. To solve this I have cut my hair into a bob before but then my hair becomes more poofy without the weight and those baby hairs still unruly. My hair feels like dead weight. It gets in my way and I hate it but also if I take time to do it it looks nice but Is still annoying.  I want to go bald but I also love my hair and am fearful of criticism. 

Also when I was 11 I found the grunge style that is very androgynous. I dressed like that till I was 13. I figured it was my emo faze or something. 14-15 I wore crop tops, high waisted jeans, leggings, skirts was very into makeup but barely wore it. I have struggled with hating my body and was at my heaviest at 14. I lose 50 pounds safely over the nine months. Even after the fifty lost I still hated my body. The summer before I turned 16 I gained 20-30 of it back.  A few months after 16 I went back to the edger look. I wear a lot of oversized men’s pieces. I would joke with my friends and say my socks are woman’s so it negates the rest of the men’s clothes. Most days my underwear, bra and socks are the only pieces of female clothes.

2020-01-09 11:47:43,em8k2t,0,1," I’ve tried to post about this to support groups before (the types that need admission fees and days to get accepted into), but by then I’ve worked myself up so much I don’t do anything. It’s 4 a.m., I’m emotional, and if I don’t do this now I don’t think I will for a long time.

Hello, my name is Frankie, I use any pronouns. Why do I use any pronouns? Because I have an intense anxiety when it comes to enforcing anything on people when it comes to my gender identity, even through the privacy of a screen.

Even the small act of lying about my name online (a name I have only recently admitted to myself I am more comfortable with than my given name) makes me feel guilty, and am only doing it because there is no chance in hell anybody will ever see this that knows my actual name.

Without giving you an entire fucking history lesson, here’s stuff you should know: I am biologically female. I used to have a ton of misogyny towards traditionally feminine women, (the whole “I’m not like other girls” mentality) and rejected feminism as a whole. I used to bind, wear exclusively masculine clothing, and hated “girly” shit. It is only just recently I’ve reclaimed my feminity, and let myself enjoy having tits and wearing skirts, and the color pink. I’ve never felt more like myself.

At the same time I was experiencing this rejection of femininity, I was exploring my gender. At the same-same time a very close friend of mine and my brother both came out as trans, one nonbinary and the other a man.

I constantly compared myself to the experiences these two people described to me while exploring my gender. I thought stuff like “well I don’t experience physical dysphoria, so I can’t be trans” and (as I was getting out of this state of misogyny) thought that nonbinary people couldn’t have boobs, as if ciswomen had a monopoly on tits??? I thought stuff like changing my name would be “disrespectful to trans people” because I don’t need to, and that asking someone to use difference pronouns for me was more work than it was worth.

Even though I’m more educated now and understand that dysphoria comes in all shapes and sizes and boobs belong to everyone, I still find myself constantly doubting and undermining my own gender identity, to the point where I convince myself none of it is even real and that I just want to be relatable to my brother and friend.

Like, I feel more comfortable being called “Frankie” than I do my given name. And some days I want to be called different pronouns than the she/her everybody sees me as. But do such things even count as dysphoria?

The point I’m getting at it I don’t identity with either cis or trans, and have hesitantly adopted the genderqueer label because I feel it’s just safe enough to skirt by on, and I’m terrified of discussing any of this with anybody for fear of being called out as just a “cisgirl wanting to feel special” or some dumb shit like that.

….I feel like this has escaped me. Here’s a little anecdote to summarize all this.

My trans brother and I were discussing gender and names. Hesitantly and casually, I admitted to him that I had a preferred name, “Frankie”, that I had been thinking about for a very long time. He asked me if he should refer to me as that for now on. I said yes. One day later, he invites a friend over, and when introduces me to them said: “This is my sibling \[birthname\]-- sorry, I mean Frankie.”

I had to excuse myself to have a panic attack in my bedroom. With tears in my eyes, I texted him to just drop the whole “Frankie” thing altogether.

If you’ve read all this, just thank you for listening. Despite my fear I really do want to at least tell someone.

Thing is, while I'm biologically male, I don't consider myself either gender and will answer to any pronoun. He, She, They, etc - all good.

I'm wondering if other amab folk like me, identify with the female autism traits - esp the ""chameleon"" trait ie the ability to blend/mask enough to get by and be fairly successful but not entirely relaxed.

The other night I watched Colette(2018) and had a revelation. I feel confined by my gender. I am a woman but the gender binary feels awfully confining and I have been experimenting with gender expression for a long time, wearing whatever makes me feel comfortable. I was definitely tom-boyish growing up, I began to identify as bisexual when I was 15 years old, but I had known for a while that I was not straight. I now identify as queer/bisexual.

I am 21 now and as I have had non-binary and GNC friends come out, I have had moments of panic where I wonder. Does this mean I'm not cis? Does this mean I am questioning my gender? Am I going through the self-realization/coming out process all over again? (I just came out to my family and on social media in the summer of 2019) I love dressing outside the norm, I love making people wonder about my sexuality and my gender. I think I look cute dressed in a lot of different and expressive ways, but I don't think that makes me non-binary? But it definitely makes me wonder.

I’m male, and I don’t assume to understand how lesbians relate to each other, but the dynamic is curious to me. I often don’t like what I see in hetero relationships.

But I am a little worried, can I identify as genderfluid without dyphoria? 

I say this, but there are a few things to keep in mind- 1) With my recent discovery, and subsequent feelings about it, I have noticed that what I previously considered 'body discomfort', or just flat out insecurity has been solved by dressing and acting as my preferred gender that day. For example, when I feel uncomfortable with my breasts or feminine aspects, binding and wearing layers/dressing masc has helped. I used to just pass it off for insecurity, but this has helped my feelings significantly. 2) When people describe dysphoria to me, I never identified with what they describe, I never felt so intensely negative, just bouts of insecurity here and there. Instead, I feel an inverse, and just feel borderline-euphoric when I have recently accepted this as my identity. 

I have recently felt a lot more confident in myself and my identity, and I am fairly sure that I am genderfluid. But so many people describe dysphoria before a transition into a new gender identity, and I simply don't think I had outright dysphoria before. The best way to describe my feelings before was being trapped in my gender, that things were expected and stereotyped of me just for being female, and I have recently felt more freed from those feelings of doubt and hate of myself for not living up to those standards. I'm not trans, because I am comfortable with my biological sex for the most part, but my identity has never been so sure.

I am not even out to anyone yet except one friend who is trans, because I knew he'd be more open to it, but I still feel changed for the better. Have any of you experienced something similar?

2020-01-13 01:59:11,enxdtj,0,1,"Hi all! Maybe you lovely people can help me sort out the confusion I've had my entire life that I've really been questioning for a while now more seriously.  
Let me start off by saying I'm a cis female. Growing up, I've always felt disconnected from my female counterparts. Now, you can potentially chalk a lot of this up to social conditioning and norms--for example, when I was a kid  I didn't like babydolls and barbies or dresses, was never interested in makeup or hair,  or playing any of the stereotypical roles and games a lot of girls are expected to play. I even claimed I hated the color pink; which I don't, I think I just didn't like people assuming I did just because I was a girl. Again, a lot of this kind of thing could just be not adhering to social norms and it meaning potentially nothing, and if this was all there was to this story, then perhaps the conversation would stop here.  


But, I always felt a part of me was meant to be a boy. I don't not how to explain it other than just a feeling I had inside. It wasn't just because I was into more 'boy' things like skateboarding and media more aimed to boys and boys clothes. I would see myself in these male figures, imagine myself as one. I always felt like a lot of girl clothing was far too frilly for my tastes when I was young and always secretly would try on my brother's clothes to see how I would look. Occasionally my parents would allow me to have one boy's shirt and the rest from the girl's section, but even those were less feminine--or at least as unfeminine as children's clothes could be.  


But at the same time, I never felt like I was necessarily put in the wrong body. I don't want to take testosterone or wear a binder or change my body in any way; never have.   


And as I've gotten older I have embraced more 'feminine' things that I enjoy. I don't reject them automatically like I did when I was young, again I think when I was a kid I just hated people telling me what I was supposed to like. But I've always had my hair long, and I always upkeep it well. I wear makeup and love doing it, I even worked at Sephora for a bit while still in college a year ago. I like wearing dresses on occasion; but I still love feeling like a boy when I wear men's clothes or women's clothes that appear more masculine. I feel comfortable and like myself. Most of my clothes are this way. I tend to wear either a more street style, or more of a preppy/business causal type of dress. All men's or resembling such. And I love cologne, and doing activities that make me feel more masculine. I like that my girlfriend allows me to embrace these fantasies, particularly in the bedroom.  


But I say all this to say that I don't know how I feel about using other pronouns, if I have to, if I truly am part of the non-binary spectrum or if I'm something else entirely, if anything at all. All I know is, whenever I fill out forms and I have to select a gender, I never feel 100% when choosing female but also don't feel 100% to choose the 'other' option, either.   


If anyone could maybe help me with these thoughts and what it all means, I'd be greatly appreciate. I know at the end of the day a label doesn't TRULY matter, but after over 20 years I'd just like to be able to have an idea on my identity.",genderqueer,I'm struggling to understand my gender,1578905951.0,"{'created_utc': 1578880751, 'id': 'enxdtj', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""Hi all!

Now, you can potentially chalk a lot of this up to social conditioning and norms--for example, when I was a kid  I didn't like babydolls and barbies or dresses, was never interested in makeup or hair,  or playing any of the stereotypical roles and games a lot of girls are expected to play. I even claimed I hated the color pink; which I don't, I think I just didn't like people assuming I did just because I was a girl. Again, a lot of this kind of thing could just be not adhering to social norms and it meaning potentially nothing, and if this was all there was to this story, then perhaps the conversation would stop here.  \n\n\nBut, I always felt a part of me was meant to be a boy. I don't not how to explain it other than just a feeling I had inside. It wasn't just because I was into more 'boy' things like skateboarding and media more aimed to boys and boys clothes. I would see myself in these male figures, imagine myself as one. I always felt like a lot of girl clothing was far too frilly for my tastes when I was young and always secretly would try on my brother's clothes to see how I would look. Occasionally my parents would allow me to have one boy's shirt and the rest from the girl's section, but even those were less feminine--or at least as unfeminine as children's clothes could be.  \n\n\nBut at the same time, I never felt like I was necessarily put in the wrong body. I don't want to take testosterone or wear a binder or change my body in any way; never have.   \n\n\nAnd as I've gotten older I have embraced more 'feminine' things that I enjoy. I don't reject them automatically like I did when I was young, again I think when I was a kid I just hated people telling me what I was supposed to like. But I've always had my hair long, and I always upkeep it well. I wear makeup and love doing it, I even worked at Sephora for a bit while still in college a year ago. I like wearing dresses on occasion; but I still love feeling like a boy when I wear men's clothes or women's clothes that appear more masculine. I feel comfortable and like myself. Most of my clothes are this way. I tend to wear either a more street style, or more of a preppy/business causal type of dress. All men's or resembling such. And I love cologne, and doing activities that make me feel more masculine. I like that my girlfriend allows me to embrace these fantasies, particularly in the bedroom.  \n\n\nBut I say all this to say that I don't know how I feel about using other pronouns, if I have to, if I truly am part of the non-binary spectrum or if I'm something else entirely, if anything at all. All I know is, whenever I fill out forms and I have to select a gender, I never feel 100% when choosing female but also don't feel 100% to choose the 'other' option, either.   \n\n\nIf anyone could maybe help me with these thoughts and what it all means, I'd be greatly appreciate. I know at the end of the day a label doesn't TRULY matter, but after over 20 years I'd just like to be able to have an idea on my identity."", 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': ""I'm struggling to understand my gender"", 'created': 1578905951.0}"

After first questioning if I was trans way back in 2005 I finally came out as Genderqueer in October. (To be fair, I didn't realize it's not an either/or deal in 2005) Now i'm considering changing my name to something more gender neutral but... i'm still on the fence.

Idk if that's being vain or if it feels like i'm ""doing it for attention""... idk.

I do quite like the 'JJ' initials though so that's going to be my starting point if I do change my name. I happen to share my first name with my nephew so I'll lose that (but I was named after a character from a soap opera my mom liked so yeah, no real loss in meaning there), 

...But John was my grandfathers name who died less than a year before I was born. So if I change that i'm worried my mom might feel like i'm ""Taking that away from her""? Which idk if even she would im just kinda inside my own head about things. 

Just had a thought that instead of a gender neutral name I could have a 'feminine' first name and keep 'John' for the middle.  ""Jade John""? ""Joy John"" Idk.

The other hurdle (apart from lots of updating things and paperwork) is that if I do change my name i'm going to have to address the fact that I ""came out"" to my family by putting a They/Them cover photo on my facebook and hoping they'd notice and figure it out from there... so that'll be a fun conversation especially considering the political positions of my step-dad...

But although I've never felt dysphoric or like I absolutely, 100% wasn't a girl, I've also never felt particularly attached or connected to that gender. Whenever I considered my gender, it was always kinda like ""Yeah, I guess I'm a girl, that's fine, I guess."" But it's always felt like it was kinda just...there, not really *part* of me. However, I had never really seriously questioned my gender until recently. Recently, I've begun feeling more and more like I'm something other than 100% female. I've never considered being a boy, I know that's not it. I had been considering non-binary, and parts of that seemed to fit, but it didn't feel completely right, either. But then, I started doing research on being demigender. And as I started reading about that, it kinda felt right in a way nothing else I'd considered had. The first page I found was the Gender Wiki page for demigirl ( [https://gender.wikia.org/wiki/Demigirl](https://gender.wikia.org/wiki/Demigirl) ) and I read this sentence on it: ""Demigirl can be used to describe someone assigned female at birth who feels barely connected or disconnected to that identification, but usually, does not experience a significant enough dissociation to create real physical discomfort or dysphoria."" When I read that sentence, I was just like, ""...That's me."" It described pretty much exactly how I feel. And the more things I've been reading about it, the more things I've found like that that matched my feelings. 

So, I guess I'm just trying to be sure that this is really what I am. I'm fine with she/her pronouns, but I feel like I would also be fine with they/them pronouns.

I also like the idea of going by a more gender-neutral shortened version of my name, and possibly being more androgynous in my appearance. Everything I've read about being a demigirl makes sense to me, and when I think about it, it just feels right. However, there are certain insecurities I can't shake. I can't help but worry that some people might think I'm just a cis girl trying to be special, or that some non-binary people might not accept me.

So my daily life (AMAB) I am mostly seen as GNC male.

I wear what I want and that is mostly feminine or androgynous, I stay away from masculine stuff because it makes me uncomfortable.

Since around 14-15 I started to self explore more and more and slowly added feminine things in my life because it would feel like me. In that self exploration I started to think I am maybe trans, I don't feel comfortable with being seen as masculine or male but don't see myself as a woman either.

I would choice to live life as a woman even if I was the only one around and it was just me on a island. In my daily life people seeing me as feminine makes me extremely happy.

I feel discomfort with my Secondary sex characteristic like beard, body hair, masculine body / face and just neutral feelings with my primaire male characteristic, its just there doesn't really bother me. I am already planning to laser my facial hair and keep waxing my body for now. But the rest just feels wrong in some way I would be much happier with more Female characteristic.

This body ""dysphoria"" comes in waves and sometimes it can interfere with my daily life and on the other hand its managable or not noticeable, But as you can tell its mostly a social aspect.  
I don't feel right with me being masculine and seen as masculine/male in daily life I just want to be seen as feminine and technically ""female"".

In perfect scenario me being seen as GNC female or Feminine-enby would be great.

the dysphoria is hard to tell, GNC for me is my body is a tool for me to express myself to others. If they don't like it well fuck them.

I am really considering to start HRT to get to the point I feel happy because that is what counts in the end, I guess?

Someone said ones to me ""HRT"" is a option like any others and why not do it if its a tool to become more yourself. if I end up being seen as a woman well I don't really care because in the end that means femininity and if I end up as just feminine male well all good.

TLDR: How do you know your gender itself is fluid? 

I’ve been thinking about my gender for a while, a couple of years now. I used to get a lot of gender dysphoria and I would constantly try to look masculine and hide my chest. I eventually realized I was non-binary and that I didn’t just identify as male since it felt as though I was denying my female side. I tried to leave it alone after that since my dysphoria lessened. But recently I’ve been wondering if I’m a trans man. It took me a while to get back to the same realization that I’m no one gender. I enjoy the idea of dressing up super feminine, but I also am actively trying to find ways to pass as a man. I’m not sure though, am I gender fluid? Or is it that my expression is gender fluid? It’s strange cause sometimes I love the idea of wearing a pretty dress and heels and styling my long hair. And then some times I want to chop all my hair off and have a lower voice and use different pronouns. I keep trying to pass as a man, but the idea of making any lasting changes to my body isn’t appealing.

2020-01-26 05:09:46,eu2iqg,0,1,"I don't think being anything but cis is an option for me, but I'm just aiming to fulfill expectations that have never been me, but I only really know what I'm not?

the facts: I'm a ""cis"" male in my late 30's, 6 foot 7 inches, masculine or at the least very unfemme features, I have kids and a wife.

the feels: I've always been bad at being a boy, but being aware of it meant I could act in the ways I knew I was deficient.  I've always had dreams of being a woman, but never felt like a girl either though I also never thought of that as an option in my rural very christian childhood during the '80s.  Additionally, I was very tall and for my late teens and all of my 20s reasonably handsome so it was easy to lean into the role as I frequently got rewarded for it.  I want to be elegant, well adorned and striving to be beautiful, I want to wear flowing gorgeous clothing, I want to let out my tears when I feel them and be consoled, to let out my joy for that matter, I want to move free at my own discretion but not have to be a leader, I am shy and I want that to be just a trait not a flaw, but is my thinking that is femme is that sexism?  Am I just reacting to the pressure of toxic masculinity, is it just some sort of need to be desired instead of the desire-er, if I could be sentimental, emotional, the little spoon and be told I'm pretty by my partner would I still feel like I'm not myself?  I don't feel right in my body, but also I've never fit in it, I had to have physical therapy throughout my childhood and that only really ended because my dad got cancer.  I've never been comfortable enough with having a body, to get to the point where I could determine if I was comfortable with my body's sex.  

I've floated statements past my family and friends, like talking about my recurring dreams where I'm a woman, or how I wonder if I'm trans, and it is just so understood that I'm this giant guy that I've only ever gotten chuckles or ""you're so crazy, \_\_\_"" responses.  They're all liberal trans friendly people, some of them are even trans themselves, but even they pass it off as just not aligning with social expectations of performative masculinity, which is true but feels more than that. I did have a few experiences where I was able to dress/act like a woman and it was amazing, other than it being perceived as just a joke/costume or kink.  

At this point I've lived my whole life pretending to be masc, engaging with my femme thoughts through writing, role-play, etc, they also all know me as being the super positive optimist despite me being very depressed (in general, unrelated), so I'm no stranger to living up to expectations that aren't real.  I guess the main thing I'm hoping for here isn't advice on how to transition or come out as much as I'm hoping for suggestions on things to do that help me cope with the fact that I probably won't ever be able to?

I'm currently spending a lot of time to finally find some kind of genderlabel I feel comfortable with. I know it shouldn't be that important and it isn't the best idea to put labels on things but I really want to show who I am.

I'm AMAB and basicly thought I was a het cis male until I met my current girlfriend who was pan (now questioning) and also was the first one who introduced me to the whole LGBTQIA+ community. I saw myself as an ally before but after my partner took me to my first CSD it strengthened my courage. I had a lot of moments in my life from early age where I tried and wanted to dress very feminine just for myself in my room, door locked - even though I wasn't really happy with it since I'm way too much of a perfectionist - and sometimes just had this strong urge to just 'switch' my body to a more feminine one and back to a more masculine one like in an instant. I always struggled to accept this as any way of 'normal' since I grew up in a small town where most people are very biased and rather conservative.  Even though my family is completely open minded I never had the courage to talk to them about it and most of my friends at that time would've never understood. So I repressed the urge to do these things with all my strength. Well until I met my current partner. She was the first one I had the courage to tell how I felt. We tried makeup, nail polish and even wearing more feminine cloths but I just wasn't comfortable with myself. Still I made some progress in accepting that I'm definitely panromantic/pansexual.

So since I kept that strange aversion against myself and condemned this feeling that I sometimes just want to 'switch' between bodies, I snapped back into this cis male 'role' that I was used to for another two years until I finally took some time for myself a few weeks ago and read a lot about gender identity, gender expression and the reddit posts of people asking for help just like me now. It didn't take long until I found the genderqueer terms genderfluid, bigender and genderflux which I think kinda fits how I feel but I don't know which one fits best (or maybe they don't even fit at all) since I mostly wear 'neutral' to masculine cloths and it's a more of mental thing to me - even though I want to try dressing a little bit more feminine from time to time again now that I'm feeling way more comfortable with myself knowing that there are so much more people struggling with similar or even harder problems than myself.

At this point thank you so much again for helping me getting this far.

Hello, I came out as two spirit today. I am a 33 year old being. 

I know this isn't as intense as somebody coming out as gay perhaps, but I do feel such a weight lifted.

The things is, I didn't know I COULD be two spirit, it's such a beautiful beautiful way to put it.

My fiance and brother in law have been supportive! 

I am part Cherokee, but even still, I think this term needs to be brought in....it's amazing how badly Anglicisation is at creating honest terms....

It's also amazing how many times I've been queer-bashed and didn't totally realize what was going on......and frankly it's happened from gay men and straight men....so there's this huge disconnect forming ....

I see now how important it is to create equality
...and to be a person who promotes it.....

The other weird part is that I do not consider myself as part of straight culture or lgbtq culture, though I would lean toward 'queer' ..... It's a unique feeling being what I am....

On a lighter note, I love wearing yoga and compression pants...and If I did rock makeup i would not wear any of that disgusting base , take it easy with that....

I could see wearing cool compression pants with a sort of robe, and eye makeup , this would feel normal....",genderqueer,Came Out as Two Spirit Today,1580444557.0,"{'created_utc': 1580419357, 'id': 'ewcjsx', 'num_comments': 5, 'score': 6, 'selftext': ""NOTE: I'm going to go ahead and cut off doubters NOW.

2020-01-30 22:07:21,ewd9un,21,3,"Guy, almost 30.  Since I was a child I've had fantasies of becoming a woman, and they became especially intense once I hit puberty.  Not only did I get aroused by attractive women, but I wanted to become them too (or become a copy of them...think shapeshifting).

I'm not sure if I ever crossdressed before puberty, but during that I definitely did.  I'd try on bras and underwear, whatever was around.  I'd feel comfortable and good about myself.  Then...I'd masturbate and quickly take the clothes off after finishing, for fear of being caught by someone.

From high school on, I can count the number of times I've privately crossdressed on two hands max.  It's just not something I do, though I'm open to trying again, albeit privately.  

A constant is that I've had plenty of dreams where I'm a woman, almost invariably a concrete woman from real life, and not a female version of myself.  Generally they're sexual but not always. I remember an endearing dream I had where I was  a somewhat famous woman and just enjoyed daily life.

I can say confidently that it isn't just a sexual thing, though I do stil masturbate thinking about becoming women I find attractive in my daily life, on top of the ""normal"" masturbation I do when fantasizing about sexual acts with women.  Related to the former, I can also get aroused by any media with guys becoming women...think bodyswap movies and similar.  The thought of them going from their dull guy selves to beautiful women is captivating, and clearly alluring to me.

In general I'd like to explore femininity more.  I can't imagine ever disclosing this to the more politically conservative side of my family, forget the more open ones.  Just the thought makes my heart sink.  

Does all this suggest I'm a transwoman in truth? Possibly.  But it would seem I have to take steps to be non-binary in my life before I really know. I'm trying to be more open with myself about it.  One thing I've done is wear a gender-neutral scent, which is nicer than wearing an overtly strong masculine cologne.  I've also incorporated more bright colors into my wardrobe, like red pants etc.  And I do like that over traditional dude garb.

I ""get by"" being a guy and I don't want to lose my penis...so I sure as hell don't want to do anything impulsive.  Another shitty thing is I'm bald, so wigs it is if I ever go all-in on experimentation.
