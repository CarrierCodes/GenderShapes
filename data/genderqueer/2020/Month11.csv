I like making myself appear like a woman, but I have never lost my sense of self and masculine identity. Came out to my wife as a cross-dresser last month, showed her my full feminine side last night. For the first time ever, it made me feel like a girl. Still learning about myself, so am I really genderqueer?


At the beginning of last month, I took the biggest step of my life and came out to my wife as a cross-dresser. I have been fascinated by clothes that ‚Äúweren‚Äôt for me‚Äù for as long as I can remember. I‚Äôve always been a ‚Äúman‚Äù. Reason for the quotations? Gender expectations are total bullshit and I hate them. Yes, I was born male and identify wholly as male. No, I don‚Äôt feel like a woman trapped in a man‚Äôs body, and I don‚Äôt feel dysphoria when I see that I am physically male, and not physically female. No one in my life ever had any indication that any part of me is feminine. That was until I came clean to the only person on Earth who knows about my feminine side, my literal feminine side who we‚Äôll call Ruby.

Every man has a feminine side. A soft side, a sensitive side, something that will make a huge, burly man break down like a ton of bricks. I‚Äôve never been one to stray away from my emotions, even if I do my best to suppress them. My feminine side is a different side of me, a side of me that I believe to be not only feminine, but female. I call her Ruby to give her a sort of pseudo-human identity, even though I don‚Äôt believe she actually has her own identity or personality. She doesn‚Äôt even technically exist outside of me, because she is me. I bring her to life by wearing clothing for women and wearing a wig to make my appearance become her appearance. I don‚Äôt transform into a different person, I don‚Äôt do it to a disguise myself, I do it simply because I like it. The closest term I found until now is gender nonconforming, which defines me to a point, but in other ways I feel like it doesn‚Äôt. You can call me Ruby, you can call me a girl, you can use female pronouns to address me, I don‚Äôt mind it. In fact I find it incredibly flattering to have enough of a feminine appearance that it completely masks my masculine experience.

If none of this makes sense, that‚Äôs because it hardly makes sense to me. This has been such a different month of self-exploring and discovery that I‚Äôm still learning new things about myself everyday. And last night, Halloween, I learned yet another new thing. I had a totally new experience last night. This past month, my wife had learned about my wig and my clothes on my terms. I couldn‚Äôt risk having her catch me in the act without me being honest with her about it. She had seen everything that makes Ruby what she is, but never on me all at once. Last night, I introduced her to Ruby. I was nervous, she had never seen her husband as anything else but her husband, a man. I didn‚Äôt not look like a man, and I couldn‚Äôt imagine what he reaction could have been. She loved it. She thought I looked adorable. I was a bit overwhelmed with emotion and anxiety that she held me in her arms and kissed me, reassuring me that she loves me and accepts me for who I am no, matter how I look. That‚Äôs when it hit me.

For the first time in my life, 28 years of being a guy, I felt like a girl.

2020-11-02 18:18:57,jmsy3u,0,1,"I'm stuck between FTM transman and non-binary. I need help.



‚ñ™ Background :


I live in a very concervative LGBT-phobic area and can't explore things much! I also can't trust the therapists that live here, so I can't go tho therapy sessions.

My family is also somewhat LGBT-phobic, specially if the LGBT person was someone in the family. I'm an adult, in my 20s, but currently live with my mother. 


‚ñ™ Family Issues :


My family/relatives cannot accept me. I'm still in the closet, but I cut my hair short and wear gender neutral/boyish clothes. 

They (especially my mom) are ashamed of me, and they keep telling me that every once in a while, specially whenever I cut my hair short.

Basically, I know I'm going to face a big argument, drama or hear a lot of nasty things everytime I cut my hair short.

About 9-10 years ago, I told my mom that I might be FTM and want to transition, she cried and made a big drama out of it until I decided to go deep into the closet.

A few years ago, I got over my guilt and anxiety, and started expressing myself again. I started cutting my hair and wearing neutral/boyish clothes ""without defining myself"".


‚ñ™ My Identity Issue :


I finally found out about non-binary/GQ, and while it sort of fits, I have two issues with it ;

a) I'm not sure If I'm doing it because I'm truly non-binary, or out of guilt, shame or compromising for my family and the society, and finding a middle ground between pretending to be a female and keeping other pleased but feeling depressed and dysphoric, and comming out and having to face a lot of things.

b) Non-binary/GQ is not really accepted yet. Where I currently live, it's not even a thing. And in other places, some people deny or make fun of these identities. 


‚ñ™ Me :


I have dysphoria, both body dysphoria and gender dysphoria.

I prefer to leave where I currently am and I'm working my way towards it but It's really hard.

I can't afford physical transition at the moment. I definitely want mastectomy and hysterectomy when I can afford it.
But I have doubts about HRT and bottom surgery.

I wish I was born as a cis guy, but I also have height dysphoria and know that transitioning cannot give me cis-male life experience.

I kind of think non-binary and they/them would be a better identity for me based on my overall situation and doubts. It also makes me numb, so I think less about gender and gender dysphoria and get less depressed.

However, I'm afraid of not being taken seriously as non-binary, and still being treated as a girl due to being AFAB.

Especially that I'm mostly into men (used to identify as gay, and still prefer gay-dynamic relationships), and I'm worried about only attracting straight men who see me and treat me as a girl.",genderqueer,Is non-binary a better label for me (than FTM) ?,1604366337.0,"{'created_utc': 1604341137, 'id': 'jmsy3u', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'I\'m stuck between FTM transman and non-binary.

‚ñ™ Background :


I live in a very concervative LGBT-phobic area and can't explore things much! I also can't trust the therapists that live here, so I can't go tho therapy sessions.

My family is also somewhat LGBT-phobic, specially if the LGBT person was someone in the family. I'm an adult, in my 20s, but currently live with my mother. 


‚ñ™ Family Issues :


My family/relatives cannot accept me. I'm still in the closet, but I cut my hair short and wear gender neutral/boyish clothes. 

They (especially my mom) are ashamed of me, and they keep telling me that every once in a while, specially whenever I cut my hair short.

Basically, I know I'm going to face a big argument, drama or hear a lot of nasty things everytime I cut my hair short.

About 9-10 years ago, I told my mom that I might be FTM and want to transition, she cried and made a big drama out of it until I decided to go deep into the closet.

A few years ago, I got over my guilt and anxiety, and started expressing myself again. I started cutting my hair and wearing neutral/boyish clothes ""without defining myself"".


‚ñ™ My Identity Issue :


I finally found out about non-binary/GQ, and while it sort of fits, I have two issues with it ;

a) I'm not sure If I'm doing it because I'm truly non-binary, or out of guilt, shame or compromising for my family and the society, and finding a middle ground between pretending to be a female and keeping other pleased but feeling depressed and dysphoric, and comming out and having to face a lot of things.

b) Non-binary/GQ is not really accepted yet. Where I currently live, it's not even a thing. And in other places, some people deny or make fun of these identities.

‚ñ™ Me :


I have dysphoria, both body dysphoria and gender dysphoria.

I prefer to leave where I currently am and I'm working my way towards it but It's really hard.

I can't afford physical transition at the moment. I definitely want mastectomy and hysterectomy when I can afford it.
But I have doubts about HRT and bottom surgery.

I wish I was born as a cis guy, but I also have height dysphoria and know that transitioning cannot give me cis-male life experience.

I kind of think non-binary and they/them would be a better identity for me based on my overall situation and doubts. It also makes me numb, so I think less about gender and gender dysphoria and get less depressed.

I\'m still in the closet, but I cut my hair short and wear gender neutral/boyish clothes. \n\nThey (especially my mom) are ashamed of me, and they keep telling me that every once in a while, specially whenever I cut my hair short.\n\nBasically, I know I\'m going to face a big argument, drama or hear a lot of nasty things everytime I cut my hair short.\n\nAbout 9-10 years ago, I told my mom that I might be FTM and want to transition, she cried and made a big drama out of it until I decided to go deep into the closet.\n\nA few years ago, I got over my guilt and anxiety, and started expressing myself again.

Where I currently live, it\'s not even a thing. And in other places, some people deny or make fun of these identities. \n\n\n‚ñ™ Me :\n\n\nI have dysphoria, both body dysphoria and gender dysphoria.\n\nI prefer to leave where I currently am and I\'m working my way towards it but It\'s really hard.\n\nI can\'t afford physical transition at the moment. I definitely want mastectomy and hysterectomy when I can afford it.\nBut I have doubts about HRT and bottom surgery.\n\nI wish I was born as a cis guy, but I also have height dysphoria and know that transitioning cannot give me cis-male life experience.\n\nI kind of think non-binary and they/them would be a better identity for me based on my overall situation and doubts.

2020-11-09 11:15:39,jqvtnx,11,1,"Hi, i'm 31.
I started my transition at 27 yo and on hrt for 3 and a half years.
My plan was to come out as a female as soon as the hrt would be effective and change my body.
But it never happened.
I had a few changes: mentally, i have never been better. I feel happy, less depressed.
But physically, i have a small breast, not something that could catch people eyes. My face didn't really feminized.
I'm 6.1 ft, 190 lb (gained 40 lb since i started hrt and cant loose it even with eating better and exercice).
I have an appointment next week to start laser removal of my beard.
But that a big irreversible step.

I came to a point where i ask myself if i should go further in the rabbit hole, go more in feminizing myself with irreversible things (beard removal, ffs). Or if i should quit everything and go back to a normal cisgender male life.

I can't stop asking this to myself since i took the appointment. ""and if i made a mistake"", some times, i can't sleep.

I really don't know what to do. Should i go for this beard removal and try to do my best to look feminine, or should i stop everything and quit my transition.

I feel like my next step will be a way of life i'll have to follow forever.
If i get my beard removed, it will change my face, and i won't be able to go back, but it can also help me to look more like a female.
If i stop my transition, in few month, my body will remasculinise, i'll loose my hair (every man in my family is bald a 30-32 no exception), so i'll be stuck in masculinity.

For my life I've had no issues with assigning myself as male, as a little kid I never cared that I was forced to play with children toys. I do remember getting upset at not being allowed to watch Totally Spies once but I do not consider that a major event. 

This started to change when I entered high school and I started seeing seeing feminine boys become more common and accepted. From there I've always been jealous that they were able to embrace femininity so beautifully. In high school my self esteem was already low enough, and my self hatred of not being able to look like them made it worse. I have a strong feature in my nose, being overweight at the time made matters much worse for me. After High School I finally had a schedule where I could dedicate myself to losing weight, and buying the food to help along my weightloss journey. I lost most of the weight, and gained some back recently in quarantine. Even with going to the gym and lifting the want of wanting to be ""cute"" never emptied my mind completely.
[8:09 PM]
I was experimenting with makeup and such at the time, but I eventually gave out of the frustration because I was not looking like the people I was jealous of so much. But I just cannot get over the envy, or desire in wanting to be cute like that. I do experience other feelings though, I also want to be ""strong"", not a beefcake of course but physically strong and capable. I don't want to present as feminine all of the time either. I'm attracted to femininity and masculinity and I desire to be seen as attractive by people in general. 

I've found self titled ""Femboys"" (I don't like that term) that are amabs talking low doses of HRT to achieve effects such as softer skin, softer facial features but without fully transitioning to women. The idea of that really appeals to me. But I still want to be seen as some degree of ""masculine"" where without the use of makeup and feminine clothing I'll still be seen as masculine as my ""default"". I'm also still insecure about presenting as non-masculine, but in my ideal world I would look amazing presenting feminine.

I think I'm here because I want more context and clarity. It's been an odd journey since at least the 90s when I was a kid.

Having thoughts and feelings about being more feminine or doing feminine things,  
Watching Ranma in middle school and also wishing that I could turn back and forth into a girl,  
Selecting ""rather not say"" in recent years, but not really asking myself why,  
Interrogating myself on who I'm attracted to (I realize that conflicts with #1; but cognitive dissonance)

But most importantly, feeling resentful of having to present as a Man and being Manly

Is that my relationship to myself isn't particularly about being masculine or feminine  
I want to be more feminine when I'm public-facing rather than suppressing it  
I enjoy my male body and male clothes  
And that I'm attracted to women

The complication in this...  
From what I [briefly read](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer_heterosexuality), (men) like me are appropriating, and that we don't belong in this space because we've never been persecuted. Worse, we're doing this because it's fashionable.

I don't know dude...  
I'm 5'4, Asian-American, and 125lb  
And none of my current circle is LGBTQ+; it doesn't feel like I have anything to gain by doing this

I think what I want to know is,

2020-11-17 16:02:53,jvvjl9,5,5,"Hi!

I've been questionning gender in general and my own gender for a while. I seem to be the kind of person that is pretty gender apathetic, I don't experience any significant dysphoria, and I could live my  life as I've always done, just vibing and shifting my gender expression as I feel like doing.

My issue is, I came out, several times, as non binary, in diferent contexts. But doing that has most often led to more gender-related anxiety than before. I think it's mostly guilt: as soon as I announce myself as being genderqueer or non-binary, I quickly feel like I'm taking up a space, a label, that's not mine to take, and then shame, for doing something morally wrong, condemnable. And so self doubt creeps in. I just can't seem to feel legitimate for a sustained amount of time. 

The thing is, while I do accept that I'm the only one that can tell what my gender is, that dysphoria isn't needed to be non-binary, that gender is a construct, etc. I also can hear some opposing arguments, such as the concept of gender entitlement that Julia Serano describes in Whipping girl, and maybe my apathy to gender is just a component of my being cis? And if gender isn't that much of a bother in my life, then surely, I shouldn't complicate things, and calling myself non-binary could be appropriative. (Yeah, I have internalized that you need to suffer to have the right to revendicate any identity of the trans umbrella)

Im struggling with my gender identity quite a bit and I have nobody to talk to about this, so I figured Id ask here. If this is the wrong sub for this question please correct me.

I am female but on the inside, I have always felt half man half woman. I am both masculine and feminine, but I have always felt closer to the masculine side of me. I never felt comfortable with the label woman because it just feels incomplete to me. So a few months ago, I asked my closest friends to reffer to me in male pronouns and it feels so good and natural. Basically I realized that I wanna be seen and reffered to as a man, a he.

But heres the catch. I love my female body and I have no desire to change it. I have the typical hourglass marilyn monroe busty figure and I love it. Only sometimes it makes me sad that I dont have a penis, because I hate periods and everything related to female reproductive system.

So I dont really know what to call myself, what label to put on myself, or even If there is a label for this? I am completely comfortable looking female, I dont want to transition or change my body, but I still want to be seen as a man, I want to be called ""sir"" and ""mr"" and ""he"", because that how I feel on the inside.

Recently I've been questioning myself and who I identify as a lot. I was born Female (She/Her) but have a problem with appearing ""feminine"" - well not just that, resembling a woman makes me feel so uncomfortable. I hate my breasts, butt, face, voice etc. And feel comfortable looking like a ""male"". 
I've cut my hair off, wear a binder and have been trying to lose weight recently and I have been feeling so much better about myself ever since!-

I am just confused about a few things.. the main thing being, I don't mind people calling me by my birth name ""Lillith"" and calling me by she/her pronouns... I hate looking like a female but I don't really have a problem with people calling me by those pronouns and my name.

I don't experience dysphoria (to the best of my understanding) but I almost always feel no internal connection to a given gender identity. I'm just hangin out. I describe myself as a woman when asked because I'm treated as one, and before I was old enough to be immediately genderable on sight, I would respond to any pronouns/gendered language used for me if context made it clear I was the one being spoken to. (i.e, ""Oi, boy, what the fuck are you doing on my roof?"") That doesn't happen very often these days, but when it does, my feelings are the same. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have moments of joy tied to presenting femininely- I look in the mirror when I'm dressed a certain way and wearing makeup and jewelry and I think ""wow, I'm gorgeous like this, my tits look fantastic"" but I have similar moments about masculine attributes- ""I'm so strong, the muscle I've built makes me look so much more powerful"". I would say there's times I identify with femininity, in the same way I identify with being a stem major- it's where my experience lies- but it's rarely strong enough for me to care if someone doesn't see that in me. 

&amp;#x200B;

It annoys me because it seems to matter so, so much to other people, and I just... don't know what to tell them, or do about it? some of my experiences are in line with regular cis people's, some aren't, but for the most part I struggle to care. Trying to lable myself that way just makes me confused. I am confused by gender as a concept. I don't feel like I'm ever going to fully get it, and that makes me feel like there's something intrinsically wrong with the way I'm seeing the world. I just deadass don't understand. I'm just here for the food, and I identify much more deeply with my favourite sports, shows and mushrooms (enoki for eating, fly agaric for not eating) than I do this whole gender buisness.

Trying to get a handle on exactly what my gender is leads to stress and confusion and beating myself up for not being able to figure it out, or even the rare panic attack. I can't scrape the surface beyond ""sure as hell not a man."" So I settled on genderqueer. Also the colors of the flag are buzz lightyear's colors so that's a plus.

I didn't start having a problem with dysphoria until a few weeks ago when I suddenly found myself wishing I was more androgynous or feminine, and theb I started having on and off bouts of dysphoria and ""oh my god get me out of this body"". I'm 6'5, broad shouldered, kinda hairy with a square jaw. If I were cis I'd feel like hot shit about that but now I find myself hating everything about my body that should give me confidence and just feeling like normal temperature shit. And god help me if I get a compliment on my appearance.

Like I said I would think about how I'd prefer to be androgynous. But a few days ago... (please don't laugh) I was reading a fan fiction about vampires and there was just suddenly a whole chapter that was just two vampire women... having sex (which they did NOT warn me would happen in the tags btw).

Anyway, as I very awkwardly read it I didn't find myself thinking ""wow this is hot"" I was feeling... I don't know how to describe it. Any line that described anything about one of the character's bodies (any part, not just the sexy parts) made me feel, ""jealousy"" isn't the right word. I guess ""yearning"" works, not yearning to be in that situation but yearning to be in the body of the women, and since then every once in awhile I feel that again. Think about what it would be like to have body of the women, how maybe I wouldn't be so miserable, wishing I could be a shapeshifter though that's less plausible.

Then I've got fucking imposter syndrome whispering in my ear trying to convince me I'm lying to myself about all of this to feel special. Which is just great.

I just feel confused. I don't know who I am, I've read about the experience of trans women and I don't know if that's me, I just... I'm lost. There's so much weird shit in my life and everything is changing and fucked up and i just want something to make sense but all I can think about is this and how turned around I feel.

that quote is also from the Out article. again, this resonates with me but i don't understand why desire &amp; pleasure seems to be rooted in femmeness. surely, masc people feel these sensations as well? even if fleeting.

If it matters, I consider myself to be genderqueer but have never 'come out', so to speak, because I'm afraid of the social consequences. That said, most of my queer friends just assume I'm 'not a girl' and use they/them which I definitely don't mind. (I dress masc typically for reference and wear my hair long.)  


I guess one of the reasons I'm looking for answers is because this question kind of makes me re-think my identity as well. And I feel like there aren't a lot of spaces I can ask this question without getting transphobic remarks from someone who is ignorant about genders that aren't binary or trans issues in general.   


Anyways, my friend Angel is non-binary, specifically agender. Their look is somewhat androgynous. Bald head but not afraid to rock a crop top and thot shorts. They have been talking to a non-binary person Sam in a romantic/sexual fashion for a few months now. Sam's look is pretty masculine -- although I'm not sure this matters. (They're both AFAB and open about it on social media so I'm not revealing anything. These are also fake names.)  


When they first met apparently Sam questioned Angel about their identity, in a way that I'm pretty sure felt uncomfortable for Angel. But essentially Sam asked if Angel was trans and in relaying this conversation to me, Angel said, ""I'm not cis but I don't really see myself as trans."" Sam said then that they only dated trans people but kept talking to Angel nevertheless.   


Anyways, Sam basically told my friend months later -- not completely out of the blue -- that Angel and them could only be friends because Sam prioritizes trans femmes and trans women in their dating life.   


I think this prioritization is perfectly valid. But I'm wondering where it stems from. Is it the label 'trans' that matters so much, or some prescription of femininity (which is confusing since not all trans women are necessarily feminine)? Could it be related to genitalia -- which would seem odd considering the conversations Angel has shown me between the two of them -- and the most crude option, really?

 My family and myself included, are pretty religious, being Christians, but not subscribing to certain view for some reason. I don't see anything in the Bible saying **anything** against homosexuality or transgender people, but I feel obligated to live with and use what God has given me.

I think I just want to be pretty and cute. At the same time my heart is really telling me that I should be a girl. I really don't know why? I live in a household and generally family with more women than men. 

Yesterday, I secretly tried putting on some of my sister's make up and for a moment, I felt pretty! That moment was ruined when I accidentally smudged it LOL!

Reasons I'm a guy:
That's what I've always been
That's what my family wants
It kind of fits my interests and personality

Reasons I'm a girl:
It's what my hearts telling me
I like feeling pretty
I like feeling cute
Don't really like my doodle 

I'm really scared of my family finding out because they're *pretty* homophobic and transphobic. 

I just need help figuring out what I am or at least how to figure it out.",genderqueer,"I'm really conflicted and confused, but isn't everyone!",1606652704.0,"{'created_utc': 1606627504, 'id': 'k33sj9', 'num_comments': 5, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Hiya!
