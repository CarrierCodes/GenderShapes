since i've been old enough to dress myself i've always been drawn to more androgynous looks. since i've been old enough to receive romantic/sexual attention, though, it always seems to be for the things that are more feminine about me (my long hair and eyelashes, my makeup, being petite, when i am ""cute"" or gentle). for the last year or so i've realized that i am really SO much more comfortable presenting androgynously. i've been wiping my blush and lipstick off every morning because it makes me uncomfy to see in the mirror (last week finally just stopped putting them on). i realized i'm unconsciously trading out my skinny jeans and tighter pants for ""boyfriend"" or more relaxed cuts. the only shoes i'll wear are my oxfords and chelsea boots--heels and flats just don't feel right.

my small crisis is i obviously am more comfortable presenting androgynously and so i really want to embrace that for myself and cut my hair, get rid of my makeup, etc.. but i also am TERRIFIED that by rejecting my femininity and removing that from my presentation i... won't be attractive to anyone anymore. i guess i know that's fucked up and i should just do what makes me feel best anyway, but i'm so scared! i think everyone who has ever expressed attraction to me has mentioned some part of my femininity! it's always my hair or my lips or my chest. i guess my concern is, even though i'm more comfortable presenting androgynously i'm worried i'll still feel less attractive. 

my big crisis is, i think i'm rejecting my femininity? one of my best friends recently came out as genderqueer (still uses he/him) and says for him it's deeper than just wanting to present androgynously/rejecting parts of his masculinity/embracing parts of his femininity. i know that androgyny and genderqueerness are not the same thing. i'm suddenly struggling to understand if there's any part of my femininity i'm really attached to though. i imagined using neutral pronouns and it felt...nice. but my friend seems to think i'm mixing up presentation and identity and it seems like he could be right? maybe those pronouns don't belong to me. is there something specific i need to spend more time reflecting on? what does it mean to be genderqueer or nonbinary beyond wanting to present androgynously and not necessarily identifying with the half of the binary i've been assigned to (OR the other half)?

2020-03-05 13:15:41,fdv3ff,1,1,"Okay so basically, since I was 13 I've been trying on girls' clothes when I felt like it, and have felt very comfortable in them at points. I never knew what it really was until about 8 months ago (I'm 18 now) when I realized I was genderqueer. However, I started getting off as a girl (mostly in school uniform) since I was 14, don't know how it started but it did, (kind of both getting off to myself, how I looked, and also because I felt really subby) and sometimes after I'd get off I'd realise that I didn't really want to be wearing it anymore, and sometimes I got off and afterwards, I would keep it on because I felt pretty in it and far more comfortable. I'm not sure exactly what this kink is called but I don't think its pure forced feminization (because I get off to myself in a school uniform sometimes, I don't know, its weird and I'm really confused).

I still have that kink and my girlfriend (she's bi and it works out surprisingly well) is fine with it. However sometimes when I wear a school uniform when I feel female I also get horny and it annoys me because I then don't really know what gender I am. Most of the time I just try to get off and see if I still want to keep it on, and sometimes I just take the uniform off right away. Sometimes I get off and realise I want to keep it on because I feel really comfortable in it. It's a bit confusing. I don't feel the same way as much (but slightly still) when I'm wearing a dress or something really pretty, and sometimes not at all when I'm just wearing regular girl clothes. 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, I do feel pretty when I'm wearing a uniform but the problem is I can't wear it without getting horny, which really pisses me off sometimes. Sometimes I want to wear a uniform and I realise later I just want to wear it to get off and that annoys me a lot too (but only after I get off). 

&amp;#x200B;

I  get gender dysphoria sometimes because of this and it's really annoying, as I cant tell sometimes exactly what I am. I get that's okay and I kind of settle in the middle on those days, but it would be nice to know if I'm actually genderqueer or if its some kind of weird thing the kink has done to me. 

I also get gender dysphoria purely because my face doesn't look like a woman's face (I've shaved my legs and stuff and this is the only thing that really bugs me, the hair and moustache that grows back is really a pain), and also while doing stuff with my gf (purely because the dick is in the way when I feel like a girl). 

Basically I'm confused and if you guys want me to give any more details then I'm down with letting you know by updating the article or replying, but it would be great if you could help me figure out exactly what's going on with me.

FYI; I've assumed I'm genderqueer for like 8 months now and come out to all my close friends and mum (dad is a bit homophobic so I'd rather not)

Being gender fluid (is there a difference between GQ and GF?) is something that’s always felt fairly natural to me, but I never really gave it much thought. I’ve always had a good bit of gender dysphoria (do GQ people typically have dysphoria?), but never enough to make me believe that I wanted to transition. Just enough so that I felt uncomfortable boxing myself in as a female, and comfortable enough that I found myself regularly entertaining the idea of be stepping outside that box and seeing what it held for me. 

Anyways, these are all things I’m still figuring out, so I’ll keep that exploratory part short. 

For the past few weeks, I’ve been wanting to tell my husband. I convinced myself that he would shame me, make fun of me, and refuse to accept the validity of my identity because he can be a bit old fashioned sometimes. 

I waited until we were relaxing in bed together and then I showed him Sam Smith’s How Do You Sleep music video, and I told him all about Sam Smith and his gender identity journey. I told him how much I identified with Sam’s thoughts and feelings towards his own gender identity, and I asked him how he would feel if I were to tell him that I felt I was also GQ. 

He walked into the bathroom, took a minute to think, and then said “it honestly wouldn’t bother me at all. I’ve always recognized that your gender identity exists you on a spectrum. I’ve been quietly aware of it ever since I met you, and it’s one of the things I love about you.” 

Y’all...

The relief I felt was unlike anything I’ve ever felt. I feel seen, heard, accepted. I feel like I can start to be more like myself without fear of being abandoned by my partner. 

That’s all for now. If you took the time to read, thank you. I look forward to reading your comments. 💖",genderqueer,I came out to my husband and it went so much better than I ever imagined.

But I’ve been questioning my gender identity and I think I might be non-binary. 

I’ve been thinking about it for the last year or so, but I’ve never really been sure. At first I thought maybe I was trans (fem to male) but I don’t really feel like a male either. I like the term non-binary but I would like some advice!

A few years ago I thought I was bisexual. I was younger and felt different so I thought “I must be bi!” Which was kinda dumb of me. My mom found out (I told my friends at school) and it was a big argument for a while. I also had some bad friends which also didn’t help my case, so it was a few months before she really trusted me again. My family is not homophobic per say, but I don’t think they (especially my parents) wouldn’t like it if I came out as non-binary, especially after what happened. I also got some new friends, but they are all in the lgbtq+ community so I don’t want my mom to blame them for “making me think this way” or something. 

I already thought about a unisex name (Jayson) that I like and I feel comfortable with. I also like the pronouns they/them, but I feel like my mom would feel betrayed if I told her that I don’t feel like my name is the feminine one she gave me.

What should I do? My friends have offered to call me they/them but I feel like if my mom finds out before I tell her she’s going to go ballistic on me :(

\-the book is very interesting in its historical part: it gives us a description of how our society became familiar with the concept of hormone and how this became more and more central

\-I like less the philosophical idea that we live in a pharmacopornographic society. I feel that this idea is too influenced by the author's point of view and personal experience. I would not go as far as to say that our whole capitalistic society is influenced by this paradigm.  
But it could, of course, be the same for me: maybe the author is right, we really live in a pharmacopornographic society and I don't realize it because of my personal point of view and experience. 

\-I don't like the memoir part. I'm not against explicit sex scenes, I just find some of the description really anatomically centered.

I am a non-binary fashion stylist and I'm working on a project to develop a workshop-style curriculum to help people working to explore their gender identity with the help of fashion and beauty professionals. If you've got time, I welcome any willing participants to take this survey! [https://forms.gle/4PvXiHgcRmEjcskU7](https://forms.gle/4PvXiHgcRmEjcskU7)

The answers from this survey will be analyzed to design resources and provide information for trans, non-binary, gender non-conforming, etc., individuals, to provide safe access to community-oriented support of gender exploration and expression processes, through free workshops (and hopefully someday a clothing bank) led by fashion and cosmetology professionals geared toward self-affirmation and empowerment through external signaling and presentation.

The aim is to be able to educate, inform, and demonstrate how a person may explore their gender with reference to their own proportion, features, desired state of being, etc. Some will want to stand out, some will want to blend in, some will want to appear more masculine, some for feminine, some without gender and some fluctuating in between. 

We want ALL of those people to be welcome and take away helpful information. 

I will preface this by saying, much of this may feel redundant. I encourage you to answer as many questions as you are able, with as much detail as possible. The questions are intentionally broad, there are no wrong answers and no required answers. If you're well along your journey to complete gender confirmation, but happen to be taking this survey, please impart your experiences both past and present.

Please be as specific and candid as you are able, if that includes indicating your ethnicity, physical characteristics, transition status, etc., please provide whatever information you feel comfortable sharing that may be relevant to your experiences.

So, I came out to pretty much everyone, including my grandmother, as pansexual a few weeks ago.

My parents aren't homophobic, as far as I can tell, but they seem to misunderstand the concept of gender.

I know I'm not trans because I'm AFAB and I LOVE being a woman, it makes me really happy. But at the same time, I love being more masculine too. I like wearing button up shirts and boy's jeans and honestly copying my dad's wardrobe sometimes (let's not think too hard about what that might mean). But I don't want to look ""like a man"" and I don't want people to see me as a man (or maybe I know that I could never really look like a man, being 4'11"" and asian). Though when I had short hair it was really fun when little kids asked me if I was a boy or a girl. I like being a woman who dresses like a man. Or sometimes a very feminine woman. Or sometimes someone with a masc style with long hair and sparkly nails.

Like the title says, sometimes I feel like I'm the opposite of agender. I have so much gender I don't know what to do with it! It's great! It's confusing!

Since I was rather young, I've always admired androgyny and masculine traits in women, but recently I've been feeling very insecure about my body shape. I identify as female, but lately I've been starting to question my identity. 

In the past I was always kind of comfortable with who I was, probably since I wasn't allowed to cut off my hair and dress masculine (think suit and tie - my mom never allowed it and would reprimand me for 'wanting to look like a man' every time I brought it up). 

Last year, I started university in another country and got more freedom to be who I am. I came out to my parents and a couple friends - they were mostly supportive. I was even allowed to cut off my hair. It was great, but for the last month, I've been getting more and more uncomfortable with how I look - especially my chest and wide hips. So I'm confused, because I do identify as female, but the parts of my body I used to like now just feel like a hindrance.

2020-03-31 19:41:55,fsjpy9,22,2,"Hey lovely folks of Reddit! If you haven't already guessed from the title, I'm genderqueer (well, genderfluid to be exact), but I'm fem passing (AFAB). I also pass as straight quite a lot depending on how short my hair is and the clothes I'm wearing, even though I'm openly pansexual. That's also the reason why I cut my hair short when I came out but now I'm trying to grow them back. 

*(inhales)* ...aaanyway!

I want to change my name to reflect my genderfluid identity more. I never liked my name anyway and I always thought it didn't suit my personality. Even as a teenager I used to ""name my personality"", using the other name my parents had planned for me, when I did something that was really *me* and not something I was conditioned to do in order to please my parents.

...so!

2020-03-31 23:15:41,fsnpor,11,2,"Let me preface this by explaining that I'm both an English teacher and a creative writer. Writing is how I process things, so this is mostly me processing my feelings and putting a little call out into the universe to those who have maybe gone through something similar. That being said, I apologize if this ends up being 10 pages long, though, I'll try to keep it short as brevity is just as important as being flowery. 

My boyfriend, I'll call him John for this post, and I broke up today after almost making it two years. We met on my birthday at a little arcade in town. The attraction was mutual as told by us standing in the parking lot and talking until almost 2am even though the arcade closed at 10pm. Our relationship budded and picked up steam. He got to see me ugly cry at the Mister Rogers documentary, and I was able to give him those boosts of confidence that so many men desperately need these days due to the pressures of toxic masculinity. He accepted every bit of my being and even acknowledged my nonbinary / genderqueer identity. But at that time, I was still mostly identifying as male, dressing stereotypically male, and for the most part still acting male based on society's standards. 

Over the summer of 2019, though, I had the amazing opportunity to travel to New York for the first time for a work conference. New York was definitely a ""queer pilgrimage"" to say the least. The sheer amount of culture and art there inspired me to start living my life in a different way. Namely, it inspired me to stop giving a f\*\*k about what people thought about me, how I looked, or how I acted. 

I was liberated. 

The first thing to change was my wardrobe. I Marie Kondo's everything I owned, realizing that most of it no longer brought me joy because most of it still reminded me being a ""boy."" And it's not that maleness is inherently bad or wrong, but it was wrong for me. Out were the khakis and button-ups. in were crop tops, high-waisted pants, and fitted jump suits (which I look killer in by the way). 

However, the more I changed, the less John recognized me. (Also, he moved to California for a job without really discussing it with me sooooooo...) 

Now, I know what most sassy sisters would think. ""John is trash. John sucks. You can do so much better than John."" 

And in truth, I wanted to feel that way. The minutes leading up to his answer after I texted him, ""Are we breaking up?"" I wanted every reason to hate him. I wanted every reason to resent him for not loving me for who I am. I wanted to scorn him for being one of those masc4masc ""straight-passing"" gays made infamous by Grindr who live by their unholy bible, ""no fats, no femmes, no f\*gs"" along with a smattering of racial dispositions. 

But that's not John. 

John likes men. And I'm not a man. 

It's simple as that. Those were the terms of our breakup. 

How do I feel? Well, of course it hurts. I'm pretty sure any breakup, especially when the relationship is relatively healthy and non-toxic such as our relationship, hurts to some extent. But at the same time, I feel oddly... liberated. John was one of the last things keeping me a ""man."" Afterwards, we even had a conversation about whether or not I would start the transition process (Yes, John would be super supportive of me transitioning; he just wouldn't be romantically or sexually interested in me but would still care for me platonically as would I him). 

Life feels weird now. It feels more complicated. When in a relationship with John, I never questioned if I was lovable or not. And for the first time in almost two years, I have to battle with that little voice in the back of my head that says, ""nobody will love you, you gender-confused freak."" I keep telling myself these are only negative voices and have no actual bearing because I'm lovable. I know I'm lovable because I have plenty of friends. I'm sure there are plenty of people who have been disappointed to hear I was in a relationship and not single. And most of all, I truly love myself. I love the person I'm becoming no matter how many unknowns there are in my future. 

If I'm being completely honest, I think the biggest unknown in my life right now is whether or not I want to seek out and be in a relationship again. Yeah, relationships are nice, I just don't know if they're the end-all-be-all they are for some others. It'll take a lot of self-reflection and exploration to find out if I want to continue searching for a romantic relationship or if I'm satisfied with having a very successful career (hoping to go for my PhD in education soon) and whole cohorts of students who I know love me. I don't know. When I put those pieces into perspective, I don't feel so alone.
