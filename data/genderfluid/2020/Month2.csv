2020-02-04 18:20:17,eyudo1,0,1,"Honestly for most my life I've never known who or what I am.

I came out as lesbian at 13, I thought it was right but I wasn't truly sure, at 16 I declared I was just bisexual to keep it even ground which still left me unsure..

I wasn't straight, I wasn't lesbian.. Then I began questioning gender itself, researching sex change, in my mind I thought this was it.

My chosen name was Zack, I thought that this must be it? I'm a man.. Right?

These thoughts were buried eventually.

And I just kept going, cross dressing as a man empowered me and that thought stuck that maybe that's who I am.. But no one would take me seriously, no one would accept it and simply think it was just another crazy impulsive idea from me.

I changed my name legally several times and nicknames yet nothing ever felt right, nothing truly felt like it was right.

I ended up believing for years I was a man stuck in a woman's body but too scared to take any steps because.. Hey.. My past shows impulsive behavior, bpd, instability and recklessness.

Who could possibly believe me? Who would possibly support me?

I believed no one. I helped others reach their goals in life switching to their true gender including my own sibling whilst I sat unsure about everything.

In the past year or so things changed, I became more open with my masculine side, I became more dominant in nature yet I was still portrayed as a woman.. It was confusing at first like two genders fighting for position.

Until I finally realised recently I'm not really one gender, I am both masculine and femme, I yearn to live life as both. And no.. Not as a butch woman.. That's not how that works.

It's strange because I always thought there were only two genders and you could only pick the one.

I'll admit, trying to be both is confusing.. But the more I've accepted myself for the confusing mess I am.. The more I've began to understand who I really am.

Sexually I adore both men and women, though seem to lean toward femboys and men who are Sexually open about themselves.. But I also adore and worship women. 

No... I've no set pronouns, I don't honestly care.

There's no wrong answer.

And yep, already anxiety fills me writing this because I feel someone will have something against it and to say.. But honestly it's my body and my rules.

And maybe I am a little crazy, bat shit insane and impulsive to all hell.

I helped others reach their goals in life switching to their true gender including my own sibling whilst I sat unsure about everything.\n\nIn the past year or so things changed, I became more open with my masculine side, I became more dominant in nature yet I was still portrayed as a woman.. It was confusing at first like two genders fighting for position.\n\nUntil I finally realised recently I'm not really one gender, I am both masculine and femme, I yearn to live life as both. And no.. Not as a butch woman.. That's not how that works.\n\nIt's strange because I always thought there were only two genders and you could only pick the one.\n\nI'll admit, trying to be both is confusing.. But the more I've accepted myself for the confusing mess I am.. The more I've began to understand who I really am.\n\nSexually I adore both men and women, though seem to lean toward femboys and men who are Sexually open about themselves.. But I also adore and worship women. \n\nNo... I've no set pronouns, I don't honestly care.\n\nThere's no wrong answer.\n\nAnd yep, already anxiety fills me writing this because I feel someone will have something against it and to say.. But honestly it's my body and my rules.\n\nAnd maybe I am a little crazy, bat shit insane and impulsive to all hell.\n\nBut god dammit i'll own this."", 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'Coming out', 'created': 1580865617.0}"

2020-02-04 20:51:08,eywttx,2,1,"TL;DR and actual question at the end.

Hi everybody,

This is my first post here. I‚Äôve been struggling with my gender identity for awhile now, and recently even thought I was trans (I‚Äôm a biological male). I lived fully as a woman in my private life (wasn‚Äôt sure yet so at work I kept it secret still) for over a week, and I loved it. Even in my dreams I always saw myself as a woman.

Then, yesterday, I woke up after dreaming as a man again, and I didn‚Äôt feel a trace of femininity. There were no feelings of negativity or sadness‚ÄîI just felt totally manly, as much as I had felt totally womanly the day before. I‚Äôm starting counseling for this stuff next week, but as of right now I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm gender fluid.

TL;DR: some days I feel 100% like a man and others 100% like a woman.

My question is: is it possible to make ‚Äúthe switch‚Äù of my own volition (mainly for the purpose of planning things in advance), or is it generally just something that happens on its own? And if it‚Äôs possible, what are y‚Äôall‚Äôs tips on switching headspaces?

Thanks!

Since that happened, I keep expecting to shift more femme again, but it just hasn‚Äôt happened. Only a month(ish) so far, so who knows, it could be months or years and then happen. The uncertainty only bothers me in relation to resolving my gender dysphoria. Right now I feel very trans masc. But if I go on T, would I regret it later when I feel femme? Assuming I ever do feel  femme enough again to be bothered by the changes I made?

You know how when you hear an unusual word, you‚Äôll start noticing it everywhere? That‚Äôs how my dysphoria feels. I knew that my chest was the biggest issue, then hips and fat distribution, also voice feels too high. But! Now that I‚Äôm listening to my body more, I‚Äôve noticed that I can‚Äôt look at my legs because they aren‚Äôt hairy enough. That threw me for a loop. I knew I was weird about my legs and hated shaving, but never attributed it to dysphoria until now.

I made a pro/neutral/con list for testosterone. Last month there were a lot more cons. Now I‚Äôm like, I would actually love to add blue sideburns to my look? I already have peach fuzz there, so it could happen. And bottom growth doesn‚Äôt seem so bad anymore. I could do low dose to maybe alleviate acne issues. The only downside that I doubt I would ever get over is going bald.

I‚Äôm currently married and, while supportive of my gender identity on the surface, my husband is super against HRT. Ok, he‚Äôs against anything that makes me ‚Äúturn into a guy‚Äù (ugh, his wording seems tailor made to cut me down). He calls my dysphoria dysmorphia, says everything I do (hair, clothes, etc) is a slippery slope, wonders aloud if I‚Äôm having a mental break, and other shitty things. I try to not let it get to me, but it makes dealing with dysphoria harder when I‚Äôm told that my feelings are bad. I scheduled top surgery for as soon as I can because once I‚Äôm off his insurance I won‚Äôt be able to afford it. But HRT, I could probably do that on my own later on. But then I think, well, what if I regret T because of my genderfluidity? I sure as shit don‚Äôt need the extra pressure or eventual snide comments from my husband about THAT.

I knew I was weird about my legs and hated shaving, but never attributed it to dysphoria until now.\n\nI made a pro/neutral/con list for testosterone. Last month there were a lot more cons. Now I‚Äôm like, I would actually love to add blue sideburns to my look? I already have peach fuzz there, so it could happen. And bottom growth doesn‚Äôt seem so bad anymore. I could do low dose to maybe alleviate acne issues. The only downside that I doubt I would ever get over is going bald.\n\nI‚Äôm currently married and, while supportive of my gender identity on the surface, my husband is super against HRT. Ok, he‚Äôs against anything that makes me ‚Äúturn into a guy‚Äù (ugh, his wording seems tailor made to cut me down). He calls my dysphoria dysmorphia, says everything I do (hair, clothes, etc) is a slippery slope, wonders aloud if I‚Äôm having a mental break, and other shitty things. I try to not let it get to me, but it makes dealing with dysphoria harder when I‚Äôm told that my feelings are bad. I scheduled top surgery for as soon as I can because once I‚Äôm off his insurance I won‚Äôt be able to afford it. But HRT, I could probably do that on my own later on. But then I think, well, what if I regret T because of my genderfluidity? I sure as shit don‚Äôt need the extra pressure or eventual snide comments from my husband about THAT. The issue seems like such a tangled mess.\n\nI would love to hear some of your stories to help me sort things out and I certainly welcome any advice ya got.', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'To T or not to T?', 'created': 1581006349.0}"

2020-02-06 22:46:38,f00n12,7,1,"Hello internet strangers.  I don't know if this is the right place to talk about this and if it isn't I'm very sorry. I'm going to try to keep it coherent but I'm so nervous.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I've had a few things hit me over the head in the last year: a couple of memes posted by some friends, another friend coming out as NB, some health scares.  I think I may be genderfluid or something, but I don't know and I'm scared to talk about it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 70/30 bi and AMAB, but as a kid I often wished I was a girl.  I really didn't get boy culture, hated it in fact and thought that girls made better friends.  Except that it was really hard to have girls as friends because I grew up in super conservative small town America in the '80s and I was an awkward nerdy kid to begin with.  I remember saying out loud on the playground that I wished I was a girl and then not having any friends and being beat up regularly for three years until we moved to a different small town. I also remembering playing with my mom's makeup and fighting with my step dad about how long I could grow my hair. I remember wishing I could wake up a girl and have no one remember me.  But it wasn't every day. I loved tales of knights and dragons, and then also of smart psychic women.

&amp;#x200B;

Just remembering this is making me shake.

&amp;#x200B;

And then puberty hit. I sorta understood boys now and had some friends, but I also had several female friends.  I still wanted to be a girl sometimes, but I also liked having a penis.  I had a lot of body image issues, so I wore baggy clothes and avoided locker rooms.  When a goth fad came around I latched onto it since I could justify having nail polish and jewelry to my friends. I still got teased sometimes, but the school was big enough that I could avoid the assholes. My step-father was out of the picture so I was able to grow shoulder length hair and I loved it. And I also loved finally being taller than my girlfriend and the way she nestled into me.

&amp;#x200B;

In college and ever since I've had a running side tale in my head, generally at night as I'm falling asleep, where I kinda go through things from my past and wonder what they would have been like if I was a women.  I've worn women's clothing a few times in private, and in public as part of plays and liked it a lot. And then I also am comfortable with being a man. I like having a penis, but sometimes I wish I didn't. I like having sex as a man, but I also really want to experience it as a woman. I want to know what it's like to be the smaller partner.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm scared about talking with this with anyone.  I'm now in the Bay Area, have lots of gender non-conforming friends but every time I think about talking about this with anyone I remember being teased and beat up as a kid and I panic.  I also am afraid of what my wife would think. I know she is queer herself, and very supportive of all our LGBTQ+ friends and family, but I'm scared of being seen as less in some way in her eyes.  And I don't even know what exactly it is that I want.  Also, I'm 6'2"", 220 pounds, have a prominent Adam's apple, a strong chin and am in my 40s. I'm envious of all the cute people I see on here and in related forums. I just feel like I'm too late, too cis-bidoes and too big.

&amp;#x200B;

So, do I seem like I may be genderfluid or something? What should I do? Who can I talk too to even figure out what I want and if it's even achievable?

2020-02-07 01:36:55,f031hv,0,1,"So I drew this today to try and explain how I feel and if you can read it I think it explains it better than just words could.

I'm 23 and I was a late bloomer: didn't start to get any breasts until I was 14/15. And when I did it was really cool, I enjoyed being an A and a B and experimenting with my feminine side. C was okay, it felt a little less me but nothing to really complain about. By the time I was 17 I had gone up to an E/F cup and was very uncomfortable, I stopped going outside if I wasn't in school or work uniform whenever I could. Unfortunately they continued to grow and seem to have finally stopped at H cup.

I have wanted a breast reduction ever since I learned about them when I was 17.

I can't afford to pay for it privately right now, it's going to take me a long time to save up and I was so close to getting on the NHS list but I was refused at the last check point - I had passed every test and met every requirement, the consultant simply had to write my name down on the list but she *told* me that I wouldn't be happy as a B cup (the NHS have to remove 500g per breast and she said that should make me about a B). She would set me some sort of task to help me think it through each time I went to see her - bearing in mind it takes 6-8 weeks to get an appointment with her. I would do this and more each time and she would say I still didn't understand and set me a new task. I couldn't convince her even though a B cup was the last time I remember feeling comfortable about my breasts...

Anyway I digress. I'm posting here because, well... this is body dysphoria isn't it? I feel like my body and how nice I could look is being hidden behind my enormous breasts. I know that body dysphoria is a mental condition and can be worked on without having to undergo surgery. So I've really tried hard to accept myself over the years, but I have very bad back pain from my large breasts. I also generally feel better and like my body more when I am more active and go to the gym regularly. But no matter how much I spend on sports bras and have to go through getting a professional fitting it really hurts my breasts to run or anything really, I've literally bruised my breasts running on the treadmill before.

So what I'm saying is every time I feel like I'm making progress with my mental health, self-confidence, body image and potential body dysphoria (not that I have been diagnosed) I get to the point that my breasts and back are in constant pain from having an active, HEALTHY lifestyle. It's like even though I'm trying to accept my body, every time I start to get somewhere and I'm happy with every part of me, maybe even able to ignore my breasts that my breasts literally fight back with a vengeance. So much pain... I've gone through physio and acupuncture and get my bras fitted regularly with little effect.

It's like trying to constantly climb a mountain of self-acceptance and each time I make it to the next plateau my breasts push me off the edge with pain making it impossible to carry on the journey, laughing in my face as my body breaks getting pushed back down to rock bottom.

Generally I've decided to live with chubby, unhealthy me... I have the drive and want to be healthy and love myself but I can only get so far with these breasts. It's going to most likely be years before I can save up a deposit for surgery and then be in loads of debt... What can I even do in the mean time? How can I feel like my body is mine again..?

2020-02-14 19:59:11,f3xs4d,2,1,"So this all began because I started dating a really attractive guy.

I realized when I was with this guy I acted different then when I was alone. This had never happened before with my past partners and I didn't understand why it was happening now. I began reflecting on my behavior around him and realized that Im not being 100% myself. I act super feminine and almost ""child like"". My brain is identifying ""Child like"" behavior as overly excited, being really goofy, loud, hyper, talkative, not thinking about what I say before saying it. I would even say that sometimes I almost feel like ""I"" take a back seat in my mind and allow myself to be on autopilot and that ""feminine"" side becomes the one in charge. 

When Im by myself though \*I\* am relaxed, mindful about health, silenced thoughts ( most days), disciplined, and focused. This seems to be my default personality and that behavior goes hand in hand with disliking makeup/skirts/long hair. I've always kept close to guys and always considered myself one of the dudes. I remember in high school when they would point out I was a girl and it would upset me. When I was a lot younger my male cousins also picked on me for being a girl and I used to be forced into playing barbies with my other female cousin. I became complacent doing things I didnt want and created a person who exists purely for my families perspective. I was being girly for them for years without realizing it. 

 When Im feminine it almost feels like Im ""playing dress up"".  When I realized I was upset with feeling feminine I had all of my hair cut off and the weight I was feeling on my head was instantly relieved. Ive been trying to flow with feeling more masculine but its been freaking me out because I feel I dont know whats happening to me. Part of me understands Ive always been this way and Ive been repressing an important part of my self from being shown on the the outer world. I feel like my real self \*now\* but I keep struggling because the 30% of me that has a feminine thinking pattern literally wants to scream when I see my short hair. I started having panic attacks because I dont look like a girl anymore but 80% of me is like ""f\*ck yea dude I look cool."" 

So, Im slightly stressed out. I know I can identify as non binary or gender fluid. Gender fluid sounds like it makes the most sense but Ive never met anyone in person that would understand what Im talking about.  I want to understand what Im experiencing because part of me is questioning if I have a mental illness, but I KNOW this is all preset mindset thinking patterns my family so graciously bestowed onto me as a child. Ive never thought I was closed minded and now Im realizing theres a lot I haven't been open to because Ive been so fearful of not being accepted. 

Im sorry if this post is all over the place. Im really struggling with constructing the details I want to communicate. This experience has a lot of depth and I could go off on multiple tangents attached to this one topic. Overall my childhood traumas created a false identity and I just discovered Im not that false identity and now Im being a new person/ dont recognize who I was last week.

I think I might possibly be genderfluid. Some of the time I feel feminine, but still dressing more butch cause that's just my style. Other times though I feel like I don't exactly fit into either category of basic male or female, like a plain mannequin that just happens to have boobs and a vagina. But a part of my brain keeps trying to disprove this and guilt trip myself into believing that I am scientifically a girl because of my body parts and that I'm just looking for attention and something to make me feel special. If I don't spiral into that thought process though, just saying the term genderfluid feels right, like I have something to describe how I feel. Now I'm not sure what to believe: my brain in trying to convince me that it's all in my head and it's fake or a little part of me that tells me that I sometimes just don't belong to either male or female pronouns.

2020-02-17 14:24:21,f59far,6,1,"Hi everyone. I‚Äôm new to this Reddit, but I want to share this story with you. 

I‚Äôm a 37 year old Genderfluid human. Born male, I have described myself as a transvestite or crossdresser for the past 20 years or so, but last year I discovered that I‚Äôm actually Genderfluid. I‚Äôve not really done much with that information since then other than dressing female a bit more often and wearing a bit of make-up such as nail varnish and eyeliner in my normal life. I still presented relatively male for the majority of the time.  

So last week, I decided to experiment. I spent the last 7 days living full-time as my female self, Jessica, and I must say I enjoyed it immensely. However, I am in two minds about it. On one hand, it was great to be able to dress up everyday and finally get some proper use out of the other half of my wardrobe (well, a small percentage of it anyway!), but on the other hand, I did miss just being able to lounge around the house without having to worry what I looked like. 

So, positive aspects: My confidence really built up. Until this week, I think I had only gone out as Jessica alone maybe 3 or 4 times in my entire life - I was usually accompanied by someone who gave me support, but this week I went out every day and pushed myself to do more everyday type stuff such as food shopping! I‚Äôve also got quicker at applying make-up and have developed a casual every-day look for myself without too much effort. 

So the negative aspects: Needing a full face of make-up just to pop to the shops for a pint of milk! Today, I‚Äôm sat in my jeans and t-shirt and just put on my shoes and coat and off I went. This last week, I spent half-an-hour making myself look good to spend just 10 minutes outside! Also, tights keep falling down‚Ä¶ I think I need to lose a bit of belly to help keep them in place better! 

I‚Äôm not working at the moment as I‚Äôm freelance, so I didn‚Äôt get to try out Jessica in a work environment, but that is definitely something I‚Äôm looking to do in the future. I just need to make a plan when I get my next job! I did consider it my last job, but it was so stressful that I didn‚Äôt feeling like adding that into the mix as well! Thankfully, I work in the entertainment industry so something like this should just roll off the backs of my future colleagues! 

Ultimately, this week was about evaluating my future to decide what happens next. What I can say is that I‚Äôm just as comfortable in both male and female modes. They each have their advantages and disadvantages and I think I‚Äôd like to carry on being able to choose between them or going somewhere in between. If anything, this week has just re-enforced the way I already felt. I don‚Äôt feel male, nor do I feel female ‚Äì I‚Äôm GENDERFLUID. I‚Äôm unlikely to transition to female but nor do I want to stay male. I know that confuses people outside of the trans community but I don‚Äôt mind that. As I said earlier this week, I don‚Äôt want to be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù because normal is boring!

I did research about this because this is important to me and I came up to a search that says that I'm possibly either Non-Binary, Gender Fluid or Demi- Girl and I'm not sure what am I to be honest. They are days when I want someone to use they/them pronouns for me instead of my usual prounouns but I'm too scared to say anything and just suffer in silence because I don't feel comfortable as a female sometimes for prounoun usage.

Non- Binary is like when you feel like you not a male or a female and I hate being referred to as a guy but at times, I dislike usage of she/her BUT at the end of the day, I feel somewhat disconnected to my sex and not normal, which hurts me because I just want to finally understand something about me that is driving me crazy and insane about myself.

Gender Fluid, idk, I feel like I'm a mixture between both genders even tho in RL I'm either in Braids, Twist or other hairstyles that you can see me as a female on the other hand, I'm a tomboy and I constantly called on as a boy and all that making me feel offended even if I don't fit what society expected me as a female should be (even tho I just want to be me freely, hopefully that wish comes true when I go to college)

Demigirl, I was surprise it existed (shouldn't be since I identify for rn at least as a Panromantic Demisexual even tho I have no one but is it weird to say I know somewhat what I want tho?) and it sorta fits my views on how I feel like an outsider of being my biological gender however, I'm just conflicted because I know I feel uncomfortable with my prounouns and I don't want to make it sound like a big deal, even tho some people Ik in real like my family would told me to suck it up and represent myself properly.

Sorry to bother u guys, I hope someone can answer me back and give me some feedback, if not that's cool, I'm used to being brush off in other subs, not that big of a deal.

**Short version:** Genderflow is a flowing gender that changes slowly &amp; constantly. There is not a set amount of genders it switches between. Genderflow is infinite.

**Long version:** Genderflow is a gender that is perpetually changing. It is never to a specific gender identity, but sometimes there are existing labels that are close to what the gender feels like at the time. Sometimes it changes to a completely inexplicable feeling.

**Genderfae!**

**Explanation:** Genderfae is an experience of genderfluidity that never encompasses feeling masculine. 

(could be andro, femme or otherwise)

**Genderfaun!**

**Explanation:** Genderfaun is an experience of genderfluidity that never encompasses feeling feminine.

2020-02-22 14:34:39,f7ta15,5,1,"Had an interesting conversation recently about gender identification, which resulted in a suggestion...

First off, I don't care that people identify themselves between male, female, both, or whatever floats your boat.  The only thing I am throwing out in the world is a better new pronoun other than ""THEY"".  Now hear me out, before you comment.

We are an evolving species...we humans.  Look at all the advancements and changes in the past hundreds of years.  However, we take the approach of this identification situation and try to shove the square peg into a round hole regarding the already difficult English language.  We have 'he', 'she', 'it', and 'they'.  I'll admit my ignorance...not exactly sure what other languages are doing, so I can only speak on the one I learned, know, and use regularly.  Grammatically using the word 'they' for a singular human being is slightly off outputting.  Just as much is using the word 'It' to reference another human.  'THEY' refers to a plural sense or use.  Someone or the masses just got lazy and is using an old language to address a new age thought process.  That's like using a flathead screwdriver for a Phillips head screw...sure, it might work, but not the best tool.

My simply minded solution is using 'X' as a new pronoun.  Again hear me out.  This is not only a letter but fully symmetrical and a symbol that is a better representation than 'they'.  It has multiple lines that come together in the center.  Even the voids inbetween the lines come to center.  Backwards or forwards or flipped upside down it is the same.  If it is lower case(x) or upper case(X), 'X' holds the same characteristics.  Quite frankly, 'X' can be used in the singular and carry the openness of one's gender.

When most people describe gender fluidity, they say they wake up feeling more masculine or feminine, but this isn't just the case for me. I want to be called a certain name and use certain pronouns and dress a certain way and if I can't or people don't respect it I feel terrible. Which is something I feel almost everyone here has felt. However, My thought process and emotions in each gender also feel completely different, almost like I'm a completely different person. 

Because I'm not really out as genderfluid, it's really difficult for me to be around my family or other people that only know me as my AGAB. So much so that I sometimes feel like I'm forced out of the gender identity that feels right in that moment as a maladaptive coping mechanism. I can't exactly plan when I switch to one or the other either, which makes it really stressful when I have spend the weekend with my family or something and I'm in the ""wrong"" identity. 

I just want to be able to be myself. It's a really really emotionally taxing situation and I don't know whether it's how everyone else feels or if I'm all alone and it's really scary.

2020-02-26 23:01:27,fa23x3,3,1,"28 AMAB here, Long time lurker on my main account, first time poster. I‚Äôve been struggling with telling my AFAB (to me, Cis Het Female, we haven‚Äôt really had this convo with each other yet) partner of 4 years the extent of my wearing and liking feminine clothes. I was ready to tell her simply about the clothes, and not throw labels on it, and leave it at that, and I‚Äôm convinced that she, a very progressive, intersectional person, might be accepting of it. But, as I was reading other stories about people coming out to their partners, I confronted the possibility that I may not be 100% male, and I decided to keep quiet, and do some more digging.

I know I like feminine clothes, particularly dresses and skirts, and I like wearing them. I‚Äôve liked them for about 20 years. Sometimes, I even get aroused when wearing them or when picturing myself wearing them, it depends on the style. I‚Äôve worn my mom‚Äôs clothes, my current partner‚Äôs clothes (why I want to tell her) when home alone, and I‚Äôve draped bed sheets and covers over me to look like dresses and skirts (I got creative).

I also know that I feel comfortable as a male, I like presenting as a male, I like doing things that people typically associate with being male, I like having a penis, I like the privilege (sorry to rub it in), I like using that privilege to try and convince other Cis Het Men that they should treat marginalized groups with respect and dignity, and I don‚Äôt currently have dysphoria or repulsion to seeing myself in or out of these clothes as a male, the only time I feel discomfort is when I get a feeling that someone else might find out and judge me, or worse.

But I also know from reading many other stories in the trans, CD, and non-binary communities that just because I don‚Äôt feel dysphoria now, doesn‚Äôt mean I won‚Äôt feel it later. Like what if I feel like I want to take it another step further and be fully feminized (because I have fantasized about it, and not actually done it) and what if I feel so much euphoria then, that I feel dysphoric when I revert to being male, and I discover I‚Äôm actually genderfluid or trans, but my partner doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable with it? She‚Äôs been supportive of other people and her friends who have come out, but she still may have needs and desires that could only be fulfilled by the traditional definition of a cis het male. She might also has the idea that I am that cis het male, and I have also been open minded to LGBTQ issues, intersectional feminism, and my privilege and my place in a world where all of that coexists, and that I should stay that way so I can set an example for other Cis Het Men.

But then again, she might not...

Ultimately, I want to tell my partner that I like wearing feminine clothes, but I‚Äôm unsure about how much to tell her, despite feeling that she might be okay with it if it‚Äôs simply me liking wearing them. I feel like I‚Äôm comfortable enough that I don‚Äôt want to hide this from her anymore, but I also don‚Äôt want to dump so much on her that it overwhelms her.

2020-02-27 00:50:19,fa3oim,2,1,"So I'm 30, AFAB (I had to look up what that meant) and I've just come to the conclusion I've been genderfluid my whole life. Maybe? I remember in elementary feeling like a boy and naming myself Jon but it was always just like a thing in my mind. It would come and go and I thought maybe it was just an aspect of being a tomboy or an over active imagination or maybe even a mild form multiple personality. My whole life I've been just bouncing back and forth between being jon and being myself, but all of it just internal feelings. I almost never feel completely female so wearing dresses was rarely an issue. I always wear jeans and a tshirt. 

Fast forward to the few last month or so. On a scale of 1-10, one being completely Male 10 being completely female I usually hover around 6 with occasional swings down to 3 or up to 8. Lately I've been just living at a steady 2 with minor dips back up to 5 where I'm an even mix. I've been feeling very Jon lately. I haven't ever really considered my gender much but this extended period of feeling Male made me think I might be trans so I spoke to my sister and she thought I might be genderfluid.

I did a bunch of research and it seems the best label for me, but I have some questions still.

1. Normally I'm ""straight"" as in I'm only attracted to men sexually, but when I'm feeling very male im attracted to both men and women. Is this normal?

2. I dont care about pronouns unless I'm feeling like 8 or above female (which is rare). I just feel bad when someone calls me he/him and then realize I'm biologically female and have that embarrassed moment. Should I define a pronoun? Right now I'd love to be called he/him but that could change tomorrow. They/them is probably correct, but I dont think I'm brave enough for that.

2020-02-29 20:39:32,fbipf6,3,1,"Hello, I think I need help with what my gender is.  
I don't know if this is the right place but oh well.

I don't know for sure because no one has ever really bothered to teach me about gender it was only ""there are man and woman and some change to the other and then there are crazy people who say that they are attack helicopters"" with that being said I thought that I was trans because I never felt comfortable in my skin and it felt right but then one day I was like ""no I am a woman"" but now I'm back to wanting to be a man. 

It clicked today that I might be gender-fluid but I don't want to be the crazy child in my family. Don't get me wrong I think they will be okay with it but they would take it as a joke or think im trying to get attention.

I don't know if im trying to convince myself that I'm gender-fluid because I can't comment to one or the other or if I am and im trying to convince myself that im not because of im afraid of my families opinion and how it might affect my life.

Thank you for listening if you got this far. Can y'all please tell me how y'all found out that you were gender-fluid and how you told your family? It might help me figure out what I am.

 Thank you for helping a confused nobody.",genderfluid,I would like some help.,1583033972.0,"{'created_utc': 1583008772, 'id': 'fbipf6', 'num_comments': 3, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Hello, I think I need help with what my gender is.  \nI don\'t know if this is the right place but oh well.\n\nI don\'t know for sure because no one has ever really bothered to teach me about gender it was only ""there are man and woman and some change to the other and then there are crazy people who say that they are attack helicopters"" with that being said I thought that I was trans because I never felt comfortable in my skin and it felt right but then one day I was like ""no I am a woman"" but now I\'m back to wanting to be a man. \n\nIt clicked today that I might be gender-fluid but I don\'t want to be the crazy child in my family.
