2020-07-01 06:55:43,hj5aj4,1,1,"I have been following this subreddit and many other LGTBQ+ subreddits watching everyone else’s stories and meeting new people and learning so much but I never thought this day would come.

I knew I was never ever going to be able to say what I needed to say in person because I’d cry like a lil bitch so I wrote a letter (in five minutes) and gave them to my closest family members who accepted me for me and still love me so that’s a win. I still think the pronoun change (she/her to they/them) is still going take a bit of time to get used to but I feel as if a weight has been lifted off my shoulders.

So far everyone online and my friends from high school have been super supportive which is great and I hope this applies to everyone and I don’t lose any valuable relationships but I know in my heart that if they don’t accept me I don’t need them in my life anyways and that’s liberating.

I’m one step closer to being my true self and I couldn’t imagine not doing today and staying in a painful dark hole that was slowly killing me.

For anyone who is still thinking about coming out, it’s the best decision I’ve ever made, but the secret is that I never thought I’d be ready until ten minutes before I did it. It wasn’t planned.

2020-07-01 18:00:29,hjfeqv,2,1,"I'm sorry if this isn't the right place to ask this, if it isn't please direct me to a better sub for this. this is a crosspost from r/asktransgender, the reason I'm posting here is because sometimes I think I might be mtf trans, but other times I feel kind of ok as a guy so I don't know if I could be genderfluid. 

I'm  in my mid-to-late-twenties,  and about a month ago I started to wonder  if I might be transgender. On the one hand, I wonder how it could take  me this long if I really were trans, but I also started remembering  things as far back as when I was six which feel like they were obvious  signs now. Also until recently I was a very religious person and not in a  worldview that was accepting of trans people. I started questioning my  gender identity before I left that, but I think being out of that could  also be part of why I'm noticing possible signs/considering it only now.

I'm  very confused right now, and I don't know what might be a real sign of  me being trans and what is me looking for signs, so I'll just list what  comes to mind.

Some things that I'm not sure but might be signs that I could be trans, no particular order:

\-I've  had some dreams (both actual dreams and daydreams) about being dressed  up as a girl. I somewhat vividly remember the first time I had a dream  like that I was around 6-8 years old, it was very sudden and out of  nowhere, and I felt ashamed because I had that ""girls are different and  weird"" immature mindset a lot of young boys unfortunately have. Either  way, I've often wanted to try on women's clothing but never have so I  don't know if I would like it.

\-Sometimes  men make me uncomfortable, sometimes just by being around especially in  groups. Never did feel like ""one of the guys"" or like an equal in male  friend groups. Men's bathrooms/changing rooms are uncomfortable  sometimes, I'm not sure if I realized about the bathrooms before. Male  humor also sometimes feels foreign to me, like I just don't get it and  feel like an outsider, and it makes me feel socially  awkward/uncomfortable. (But I'm also autistic, and sometimes everything  is like that so I don't know what the real reason is?)

\-Sometimes  my genitals gross me out and I really don't want to see them sometimes.  This was really bad when I first started questioning if I was trans, I  was acutely aware of them to the point I was walking funny because they  felt weird, and I took upwards of ten minutes to use the bathroom  because I was nervous about pulling down my pants and seeing them.

\-I'm  not really sure what dysphoria is supposed to feel like, so I don't  know if I have it. But since I started questioning, whenever I've had  any sort of discomfort about my body I've almost felt hopeful or excited  to feel it, as if possible dysphoria is validating? But when I think I  haven't felt dysphoria, it disappoints or saddens me? The same  disappointment/something like sadness occurs whenever I think I might  not be trans.

\-Sometimes I feel  like I'm actively looking for signs that I'm trans, and I've heard it  said that looking for signs is itself a sign, but I'm not sure that's  true?

\-I'm starting to dislike  facial hair. In the past I wanted a beard but could never grow one, and  then eventually decided I didn't want one but liked the scratchy feeling  after shaving. Now though I don't like that feeling, and while having  hair grow out of my neck was annoying before I'm starting to really lose  patience with it, and with how every morning after I shaved the night  before there's stubble.

\-I  practiced with a possible name by playing video games where I can play  as a girl and be referred to as she/her with a chosen name. Sometimes I  really enjoyed it and it made me feel like I could someday really use  that name and be pretty, other times though I was indifferent.

Now here's some other stuff that makes me unsure if I really might be trans, or if I could just be jumping to conclusions:

\-I'm  still having trouble getting over the fact it took me this long to  seriously question it. I do think I might've been repressing a ton of  signs, but I still can't get over this.

\-It might be a fallacy, but I can't stop but think, what are the odds of me of all people being a trans woman?

\-Sometimes  when I practice with girl name and she/her pronouns, I ask myself  ""Seriously? Are you really, actually doing this? Really?"" and maybe  that's just because in the past I would've thought it absurd, and never  envisioned that I would one day really think about being trans.

\-I  like girls, at least romantically. Not sure about sexually because my  genitalia makes me uncomfortable. Point being, there's something about  me, who is AMAB, thinking I might be a lesbian, that just sounds too  weird.

\-I don't always feel  uncomfortable as a guy. Sometimes I'm more or less okay with it. But I'm  not sure if that's because I'm cis or if it's because I'm just used to  thinking I'm male and it's habit? Sometimes the fact fact that I'm  comfortable as a guy is what bothers me, but sometimes it doesn't bother  me. So I'm not sure, but maybe I could also be genderfluid, and male  sometimes, female other times? I'm very new to all this terminology, so  it makes it hard to match up gender identities with what I'm feeling.

\-A  lot of the time before I started questioning, my dreams/daydreams about  wearing women's clothing involved me being forced to do so. Wouldn't it  make more sense if it was of my own free will? Which admittedly, has  been more often the case now that I've started questioning. But I can't  shake the question that maybe I just have a disrespectful fetish, though  since I've started questioning I've really disliked that it's treated  as a fetish. But it's also possible that I just like crossdressing but  aren't trans? (Though on the other hand, I don't really like the idea of  wearing women's clothes if I don't look/feel like a women or have a  female body. Ugh, this is really confusing)

\-My  internal dialogue sounds like a male dialogue (in voice, and kind of  manner of speech), which to me makes it seem like I would identify as a  guy. On the other hand though, the very fact that it sounds like a male  dialogue distresses me.

This  has been a long spiel, and I know as soon as I post this I'll remember  other signs and also other reasons I'm not sure.

2020-07-01 19:00:24,hjgmgp,14,1,"Hi. Asked this on r/NonBinary but thought I'd see if anyone here can help. 

AMAB 30y/o. Discovered in the last few month I am likely non-binary/genderfluid and am exploring that.

I'm lucky in that I don't suffer from a huge amount of dysphoria, but one area I do is with my chest. I wish I had breasts, but I'm not going to be able to fix that unless I start HRT which at least for the moment I have no intention of doing. The issue I do have is with my chest hair.

I don't have a huge amount in comparison to some AMAB people, but enough to cause discomfort. I shave with a manual razor but it just doesn't get close enough. I considered using Veet but according to the instructions on Amazon its not to be used on nipples and I have hair around my nipples that I want gone, so that's no use. I also saw some stories of chemical burn on nipples from it so I really don't want to risk it.

I know waxing is an option, but I heard you have to let the hair grow out a bit first which isn't going to do my dysphoria any good. Some places suggested plucking with tweezers but that seems way too time consuming. Don't really want to get into laser hair removal, that seems very expensive and time consuming (from what I've heard, not looked into it that much.)

I really don't know what to do. I see so many AMAB people online that look smooth skinned and I'll be honest, I'm jealous. Are they lucky with their genetics are do they have a secret I don't know?

I also saw some stories of chemical burn on nipples from it so I really don't want to risk it.\n\nI know waxing is an option, but I heard you have to let the hair grow out a bit first which isn't going to do my dysphoria any good. Some places suggested plucking with tweezers but that seems way too time consuming. Don't really want to get into laser hair removal, that seems very expensive and time consuming (from what I've heard, not looked into it that much.)\n\nI really don't know what to do. I see so many AMAB people online that look smooth skinned and I'll be honest, I'm jealous. Are they lucky with their genetics are do they have a secret I don't know?\n\nAny advise appreciated."", 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'AMAB Body Hair', 'created': 1593655224.0}"

2020-07-01 22:30:31,hjkp3s,0,1,"Survey link: [https://uwmadison.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_8v48USA6V9kMgrX](https://uwmadison.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8v48USA6V9kMgrX) 

Hello all, my name is Louis Lindley and I am a queer trans man and a researcher with the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am posting this survey on behalf of a queer cis woman in our research lab who has been a member of the[ Trans Research Lab ](https://trl.education.wisc.edu/)for 8 years and this study was developed with the support of the Trans Research Lab. Without outing anyone, I will say that many people in the lab are members of the trans, nonbinary, and gender nonconforming (TNG) community. The producer of the survey also collaborated with members of the [Wisconsin Trans Health Coalition](https://witranshealth.org/) and [FORGE Wisconsin](https://forge-wi.org/about/) (a national transgender anti-violence organization) in developing the study. 

The Trans Research Lab is a social justice-driven lab conducting research that affirms the experiences of TNG and gender diverse individuals. Through a critical lens, our work aims to meaningfully transform and advance the position of TNG and gender diverse issues within the field of psychology. 

Some FAQs about the survey:

* How were trans folks involved in development of this survey?
   * Trans folks were involved in the development of this study in multiple ways:
      * identifying the body-related construct of interest that we hope to measure
      * generating items for the new measure
      * focus groups to review the items of the new measure and provide feedback
      * consultation from trans professionals about the new measure
      * Additionally, whenever possible, we used measures in our survey that were designed by and for trans individuals and that de-pathologized trans identities
* What is the specific objective of the study and its intended impact on future trans lives?
   * The objective of this study is to develop and validate a new measure of how TNG individuals experience their body. We aim to create a new measure that captures nuance in TNG body experiences (e.g., we are creating a measure that does not pathologize how people relate to their bodies and is not reliant on gender dysphoria diagnostic criteria).
* Who is funding the study? Describe any conflicts of interest.
   * This study is financially supported by the Baldwin Wisconsin Idea Endowment Seed Grant and the Virginia Horne Henry Fellowship. There are no conflicts of interest.
* Is there IRB/Ethics board approval? Describe ethical practices specific to trans subjects.
   * Yes, this study has been approved by the UW-Madison IRB. Ethical practices specific to trans participants include not recording any identifying information, using trans-affirmative language throughout, using measures in the survey that are trans-affirmative, and offering compensation of $100 to every 20th participant.
* What is the target study population? Describe geographic scope, languages, and intersectional inclusion.
   * The target study population is any English-speaking  adult who identifies as TNG. The survey is open to anyone with internet access regardless of geographic location. Regarding intersectional inclusion, this study is intentionally recruiting trans folks who       identify along gender binary (e.g., transfeminine of center, trans woman, transmasculine of center, trans man, etc.) as well as individuals who are nonbinary, genderqueer, bigender, multigender, etc. This study has had an intersectional focus since its proposal, with Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw's work on intersectionality being cited throughout from its inception. We are intentionally recruiting from community-level organizations and groups, because so much research with TNG participants       recruits from academic places (e.g., students, etc.)
* Is there a cost or travel requirement, or is there compensation for participants?
   * There is no cost or travel requirement. This study just asks participants to complete an online survey from their home, the library, work, etc. Every 20th participant will be compensated $100 until we reach approximately 300 participants.

The thing is, I don't consider dressing masculine or ""like a man"" to be crossdressing for me personally because I'm fluid between male, female, and agender.  I've been told it's fine for me to do it, but then I've been told I'm characterizing and cheapening my identity by doing drag, and that it's a slap in the face to cis female Drag Kings because I'm ""cheating"" somehow because I identify with masculinity in the first place.

My kid (11) and I read the Magnus Chase series together. One of the characters is AMAB gender fluid. My kid has been asking a lot questions. As someone who is not gender fluid, I can't answer them. I also suspect the character may be inaccurately portrayed, since it is written by a cis-male. (Just look at r/menwritingwomen to see how poorly they understand anyone feminine.)

Basically, if you would point me toward any sources you feel actually represent your experience or would share some of your experience, it would be helpful. If you've read the books and can point out accurate and inaccurate info, that would really help, too.

Their ultimate goal is to become the gender they feel attuned to right? 
And Non-binary feel gender dysphoria when being grouped into a binary gender right? So their goal is to have traits of both genders. 
And Agender people don't feel comfortable with being on the spectrum at all. So their goal is to look like no gender thus avoiding having constant dysphoria. 

So you are genderfluid and you never know what gender you suddenly feel closest to, so you can never ever not have dysphoria because you'll never know right?

So their goal is to look like no gender thus avoiding having constant dysphoria. \n\nSo you are genderfluid and you never know what gender you suddenly feel closest to, so you can never ever not have dysphoria because you'll never know right? \nDoesn't that just sound like the worst? \nThat there is a goal you can never reach and doesn't it drive you mad? \n\nDo you avoid gender in general because of that? \n\nAgain I'm very sorry if my questions are ignorant but I'm really trying to understand."", 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'Help me understand you.', 'created': 1593844385.0}"

One of my best friends came out, a while back, as genderfluid. I’m cis, and it was new territory for me. They helped me understand certain things I was missing before- like my super gendered language and things like that.

I’m still figuring out how to talk to them about their identity. I usually wait for them to bring it up, because I never want them to feel pressed to educate me or talk about their identity when they’re just going about their day, you know?

Lately, I realize that I have been more or less acting like my friend is NB rather than genderfluid- I don’t bring up their identity unless it’s really really pertinent to the convo, largely because I don’t know how to respectfully broach it. Should I...check in with them on what they are identifying as each time we talk? Should I just not bring it up until they self-identify (they’ll sometimes slip in a “ur boi” and I never know how to affirm them, or if they even want me to mention it).

Anyway, today over breakfast I finally worked up the courage to tell my mom I wanted top surgery. She was displeased, to say the least. She had a very ""I already put up with you wearing men's clothing sometimes isn't that enough?"" Kind of view to things. 
On top of that, she thinks I've convinced myself I'm trans because I have anxiety and it's something I'm doing to fit in. Like, if I wanted to fit in, I would make a Snapchat account and drink more Starbucks, not choose to be part of an opressed minority. 
She went on to read me this horrible article about how all these teenage ""girls"" are suddenly coming out as trans to fit in. The article claimed you could gain testosterone and get top surgery all without any sort of documentation from a therapist or anything. It also made it sound like GSA clubs are ""turning"" people trans and quoted fucking JK ROWLING. I tried to point out how absurd some of these points were, but she claimed I was not being open to discussion. I said I was making sure the discussion went two ways.
Oh, and she claimed my two trans friends had valid identities, but not me. I got mad at her and told her it was because they weren't her kids and I was that it was okay for them to be trans. She accused me of putting words in her mouth, but it's true. Parents just want their kids to be ""normal.""
She says we'll have to talk about it once my dad gets home. Mind you, my dad once told me that trans people should just never transition so there's no issue with bathrooms. So that conversation is just going to be them trying to talk me out of ""messing up my life.""
I'm 18 in just over a month, so I don't need their permission or anything. I'm gonna do it no matter what, with my (trans)  boyfriend and his family to help me.

I got mad at her and told her it was because they weren\'t her kids and I was that it was okay for them to be trans. She accused me of putting words in her mouth, but it\'s true. Parents just want their kids to be ""normal.""\nShe says we\'ll have to talk about it once my dad gets home. Mind you, my dad once told me that trans people should just never transition so there\'s no issue with bathrooms. So that conversation is just going to be them trying to talk me out of ""messing up my life.""\nI\'m 18 in just over a month, so I don\'t need their permission or anything. I\'m gonna do it no matter what, with my (trans)  boyfriend and his family to help me. I guess for now I\'m just disappointed that my mom thinks I\'m taking it and seems very closed-minded toward the idea. But hey, at least I haven\'t been disowned...yet?\n\nAnyone got any advice on how to approach this with my mom? I don\'t think her stance is going to change, but I at least want to not be an asshole when I inevitably get very frustrated with her.\n\nOh, and happy 4th to my fellow Americans.', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'Told my mom that I want top surgery (rant)', 'created': 1593935513.0}"

Hello! After grappling, researching, and thinking for quite some time, with the help of Reddit, I have come to the conclusion that I am genderfluid! I want to come out to the Internet because it makes me happy to feel like I fit in. I still haven’t told anyone in person, but I’ll do it once I’m more comfortable. I’m pretty chill about it because, fortunately, most of my friends and a lot of my family are allies or members of the LGBTQIA+ community. I just don’t really want to draw much attention to myself. If you have any ideas about how to come out without making it a huge process, let me know! I feel pretty lucky that I’m not incredibly stressed and anxious about this like many are. I’m mostly just looking for positivity and support! :) I’m excited to be able to tell the Internet!

(I’m 22, AFAB)

I also want to add that I’m not at all putting down people who want to come out in a more emotional/extravagant/anything else way!! I’m just not that type of person at all. I don’t really ever talk about my personal life with anyone! I’m also bad at heart-to-heart stuff, and I admire those who are good at it!

2020-07-07 14:28:21,hmvjh6,3,1,"Hi, I am 24 female by birth and I'm starting to wonder if I might be genderfluid??

I have more male than female friends and have always found guys easier to be around and most female friends I do have are also a bit tomboy or not traditionally feminine

I've always been very tomboy, i remember distinctly my nan always saying that I shouldve been born a boy, never afraid to get dirty, late interest in makeup and 'dressing' up, always had gender neutral interests growing up. Don't get me wrong, I love being a woman sometimes, putting makeup on, being flirty with guys and girls, i even own wigs.

As an adult, I tend not to care too much about body hair on legs or armpits, if i can be bothered or I'm feeling particularly girly that day (or getting a bit of action hehe) I will shave. I can normally be found in relatively neutral clothing i.e. joggers and t-shirts, which is almost always accompanied with an oversized hoody. I rarely put makeup on, even when going out or socialising. Ive noticed and remembered as I'm writing this that I don't nor have I ever exactly sat up straight in a feminine way either 😂 

I've wondered before what it would be like to have a male body, ive had dreams in which I had a penis. I'm also large chested and ive never liked them. Whenever I describe them I always state that I find them just in the way most of the time. However, I do love the way I look in some fitted bras or lingerie. I can remember times though when I have had urges to literally rip or cut them from my body.

This is a very new idea to me and i would really appreciate any advice or even further questions to help make me think about something I haven't thought of.

I've had 2 Reddit accounts before now, and I've crossdressed (MtF) for almost 10 years sporadically, always secretly. I've never once come out to anyone in my life, despite having *fooled around* some; I won't get into that though. The point is I've never been fully content as a man, and I've never shared that with anyone other than online friends, not friends or family in person, only anonymously online. Nearly 10 years of being secret, constant purging my stuff, my thoughts, everything.

Well 2 days ago I vented my frustrations and anxiety anonymously on the Whisper app about being male, wanting to express myself through other clothes, and wishing there was someone, preferably a female or a femme person to help me shop so I'm not so nervous... Lo and behold, a non binary gender fluid female (female only in that its her birth assignment) messaged me, and we hit it off fabulously.

We happen to be in near identical situations.

The main thing I want to do right now is let my friends and sisters know that I prefer they/them pronouns. I was afab, so I'm ok with she/her sometimes, but I'm not as ok with being acknowledged as ""miss, lady, or woman."" I've never had someone use he/him for me, so I guess that's more of a dream that isn't likely to come true. But whenever a college pal used they/them when referring to me, it made me really happy.

Again, I'm not certain if my preference of pronouns is merely due to my lack of self esteem, lack of positive body image, or if it's internalized misogyny or whatever. I just can't get over that feeling of.. euphoria(??) I got when being referred to as they/them.

Anyway, the main thing I'm hung up on is letting the people closest to me know that I prefer these pronouns over the ones they've been using for me the entire time they've known me. I think I'm irrationally afraid of letting them know. Whether it's as simple as me adding my pronoun preference in a social media bio, or writing out a paragraph of explanation, I'm afraid. I think I'm worried I'm going to sound pretentious, or if I try to explain, I'll make it too lengthy.. basically making a big deal out of it when I'm not trying to.

I usually have a hard time communicating anything, especially if I'm asking for something I want for myself.

I was afab, so I\'m ok with she/her sometimes, but I\'m not as ok with being acknowledged as ""miss, lady, or woman."" I\'ve never had someone use he/him for me, so I guess that\'s more of a dream that isn\'t likely to come true. But whenever a college pal used they/them when referring to me, it made me really happy.\n\nAgain, I\'m not certain if my preference of pronouns is merely due to my lack of self esteem, lack of positive body image, or if it\'s internalized misogyny or whatever. I just can\'t get over that feeling of.. euphoria(??) I got when being referred to as they/them.\n\nAnyway, the main thing I\'m hung up on is letting the people closest to me know that I prefer these pronouns over the ones they\'ve been using for me the entire time they\'ve known me. I think I\'m irrationally afraid of letting them know. Whether it\'s as simple as me adding my pronoun preference in a social media bio, or writing out a paragraph of explanation, I\'m afraid. I think I\'m worried I\'m going to sound pretentious, or if I try to explain, I\'ll make it too lengthy.. basically making a big deal out of it when I\'m not trying to.\n\nI usually have a hard time communicating anything, especially if I\'m asking for something I want for myself.

I finally came out to my girlfriend as a male that Im gender fluid or non binary, still need to see a therapist.  Ive been depressed and always felt I'd get to a point where I would kill myself cause I could never been happy or knew I'm not worthy.  I was also in a culture that is HEAVILY heteropatriarchal.  I crossdressed I remember at age 3 and then throughout my life and as a kid never gravitated thwords androgynous and trans porn.  Like the first porn I went into was ""tranny"" porn and then just fixated on that, but I always LOVE woman , Ive always wanted to relate to them and just go up and talk to them be confident and I enjoy sex with females.  But I was always not sure if Im gay or straight, in my family gay is the worst thing ever and they can't grasp its something you don't pick.  But I didn't know what I am, like I wasn't gay but I wasn't straight either, and bi never made sense really.  lost my virignity to ts escorts  around 22 and just went with that until around 27, over 50-100, all the wasted money.  I started as a top and then over the years preferred to bottom now, and it was femboys, crossdressers, trans woman, but never dudes, that never did it for me. But that kept me so closeted and everything about any femininty I always supressed and was afraid to admit it cause a man is supposed to be strong, show no emotions and mental health is bullshit.  

Its like I was emulating how I'm supposed to live in every aspect to conform to this expectation and it caused deep issues, depression, drug abuse, not actually ever relating to a human, cause Ive never talked to any person about the issues after 34 f'ing years.  Lately Ive been so depressed and would get high on adderall and watch trans porn, and one day I was like looking at it and it clicked I'm like I love woman but I prefer them with a penis, and I'd pick that over a genetic female any day, so if if I can just live in peace like that I'd be happy.

I started researching gender dysphoria cause Ive always not liked my name and cringe looking at me in the mirror, it was worse before , but now its not really an issue now.  But still seeing me on a video or something always made me deeply uncomfortable for whatever reason.  Ive been researching for weeks and small things have started clicking, why do I like this forced feminization and then after I climax I want to get under a deep rock and die.  So all this things clicked and finally for once in my life everything made sense.  The trans gender fluid fit all the things I read about it and then I had the whole matrix experience I shit you not.  I realized all of sudden the matrix and it all made sense, I woke up a few days later after coming out to my sister and cousin and one day before I was SCARED TO DEATH to let my parents know.

That day I felt I HAD to tell them, I had this calm confidence in my heart.  I'd never felt feelings before I always felt like a robot, and finally started feeling things, I could feel in my stomach when my girlfriend was feeling bad, before we both had terrible communication, its like broken people attract broken.  My grilfriend's 2 exes one for MTF trans and one bi, so now I told her this and now our ENTIRE world has changed.  I felt this radiating in my gut and I asked her what that is, and she said empathy, and I just broke down and cried, I felt ALIVE for the first time in my life.  I look at the walls now in my house and they feel foreign like its not really me, Ive ever really let myself explore what I wanted and I didn't even know why I was holding it back, but I had this deep torture that I didn't have the tools in my brain to put together.

I was a bad person before, jealous, angry, always compared everyone and everything to eacthother and always felt Im not worthy.  It took me 20 years to be comfortable to look at people in the eye. Whenever I looked into peoples eyes I felt insecure and small and always would think do they see through me is my emulation program in my head working correctly.  Awful way to live and not know why.

I'm a COMPLETELY changed person, all the stuff I liked feel neutral, my girlfriend and everyone else seems me different now, Im actually can't help myself but try t say nice things to people, before I would compulsively say bad things or just passive aggressive or very sarcastic, in every situation. Now Im not like that, now when I hear my voice when I talk in my head it sounds right.  Before I liked how my voice sound to me when I spoke, but the voice I heard played back in a recoding was very deeply uncomfortable, and I know a lot of people have this, but now, when I hear it recorded back it has a very slight feeling of that but it sounds more in tune with how I hear my voice when I speak.  My girlfriend and our sex life has been AMAZING now, we have gotten so close I know she is my soulmate, I think we still need 

TL:DR - I had the matrix moment when I realized my gender dysphoria at age 34 and now I'm completely another person to myself, I actually love and want to live and stand up for me.  My voice sounds different to me I'm happy in my skin and I have this calm in me that never was there and I want to just enjoy the moment and connect with people. Something I never wanted.  Don't have any desire to use any substance cause I don't need to feel good about myself to do something I'd otherwise be afraid to. Im not really into or have the urge for trans porn again.

Has anyone else had this type of experience, Its the most sure thing I've felt but seems like magic I can't explain.  It's like I went through puberty in the last week, feelings were not something I knew or could recognize.  It's like my internal workings have been off, but had this gender euphoria.

AFAB- but, I've never been a girly girl, my father always wanted a boy so I filled that void. Fishing, camping, farm work, changing the oil, you name it I was there. I played mostly with male cousins and loved the rough and tumble. I remember as a young child (probably 3 y/o) being taunted with being called ""princess"" by my brother or father and I would fume. I rode horses for many years and as my breasts developed I hated the bouncing, so I stopped. Being stronger than most of the other girls, and not knowing how to fit in was a regular feeling. Throughout high school and college I embraced my feminine side and dabbled in androgynous and femme looks, my hairstyles and style seemed to fluctuate between long and short, spiked, curled, and all kinds of colors. I always felt like I wanted to reinvent myself and nothing ever felt right.

On occasion I'd post some pictures and chat with others online, but nothing in the ""real world"" around me. With that, I've always believed myself to be straight and cis. But as time goes on, things change.

For the past few years, I've accepted that my crossdressing is more than just a fetish. I mean, once I'm home from work I'm typically dressed as the girl me. Heck, I've even taken some herbals from time to time in hopes of growing some form of breasts and booty. Do I still get a sexual thrill when I see myself as a hot or cute girl, hell yeah, but its more than that now. 

Along with this, I've always had a fascination with transgender girls and crossdressers when I would look at this explicitly, more so than just girls. Partially I think this is because I'm watching someone who I envy, to a degree. 

Now with all that said, I do still enjoy the male side of me too. I see him in the mirror on occasion, especially when I'm dressed nice, and I'm proud and happy. So this is the part that's been making me question that maybe, just maybe I might be Gender Fluid. Or there might be a different term for all this. Please let me know!

But I'm thinking if I dip too far into one of them, then I will not be happy. Tipping the balance, so to speak.

Oh yea, in addition, I'm still a virgin after all these years which has really made me question my identity as if something was wrong. I enjoy dating girls, even though it's not often, but the actual sex isn't a requirement for my enjoyment. I don't have that assertive nature to initiate anything too.

2020-07-13 15:02:23,hqgtem,1,1,"I'll begin by saying that this is mostly regarding my husband and a co-worker. He works in a residential group home setting. This means he and his co-workers work in a mainly open-concept house and in any of the layouts I've seen, the workers don't have a particularly private ""workers only"" room.  This means that usually, and a lot of the times, the residents, who range from infants to pre-adult teens, can just walk in on work conversations. 

My husband has a co-worker who, I believe, is genderfluid. I'm hoping that I'm using the correct term for the description I'm about to give. Please correct me if I'm wrong. 

Let us say his co-workers' legal name is Frank. Now, Frank has made a request that when anyone works with him that they address him as male and he prefers to be called ""Adam"". Please note that ""Adam"" comes to work dressed, most commonly as a woman. Now, when ""Adam"" is being addressed in front of a resident, she would like to be called ""Jane"".

Now, if Adam and my husband are speaking in the kitchen, near the living room, within earshot of a resident and he addresses him as Adam and that resident comes in, he is supposed to immediately continue speaking with Jane without missing a beat.

To make matters worse, if a report needs to be written regarding an interaction with Frank/Adam/Jane, it needs to note that ""Adam was in the kitchen with a co-worker and then a resident came in and Jane had to assist with.....""  which can lead to a very confusing report to read. Especially if this would ever need to be used in a court hearing. 

This issue has been brought to HR by Frank before since this request could to be properly followed. 

Within any other setting, I could see this being done. My question is, within a residential setting, where the workers almost never have closed doors or privacy, are almost always able to be heard by residents and with youth who are already struggling with their lives, is this going too far?

TL;DR: Genderfluid co-worker wants to be called by 2 names, one male and one female name, at work but only in specific situations which can happen without warning. Neither name is his legal name.",genderfluid,"To the Genderfluid community, is this too much to ask or are we being small-minded?",1594677743.0,"{'created_utc': 1594652543, 'id': 'hqgtem', 'num_comments': 1, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'I\'ll begin by saying that this is mostly regarding my husband and a co-worker.

I\'m hoping that I\'m using the correct term for the description I\'m about to give. Please correct me if I\'m wrong. \n\nLet us say his co-workers\' legal name is Frank. Now, Frank has made a request that when anyone works with him that they address him as male and he prefers to be called ""Adam"". Please note that ""Adam"" comes to work dressed, most commonly as a woman. Now, when ""Adam"" is being addressed in front of a resident, she would like to be called ""Jane"".\n\nNow, if Adam and my husband are speaking in the kitchen, near the living room, within earshot of a resident and he addresses him as Adam and that resident comes in, he is supposed to immediately continue speaking with Jane without missing a beat.\n\nTo make matters worse, if a report needs to be written regarding an interaction with Frank/Adam/Jane, it needs to note that ""Adam was in the kitchen with a co-worker and then a resident came in and Jane had to assist with.....""  which can lead to a very confusing report to read. Especially if this would ever need to be used in a court hearing. \n\nThis issue has been brought to HR by Frank before since this request could to be properly followed. \n\nWithin any other setting, I could see this being done. My question is, within a residential setting, where the workers almost never have closed doors or privacy, are almost always able to be heard by residents and with youth who are already struggling with their lives, is this going too far?\n\nTL;DR: Genderfluid co-worker wants to be called by 2 names, one male and one female name, at work but only in specific situations which can happen without warning.

Chief among them is that I've come to believe that I'm genderfluid. I always just assumed I was a guy and never really put much thought into my gender - it just was what it was. But I've always had something of a fascination with women's clothing, even as a kid, though I eventually just kind of ignored that and stopped thinking about it. (Thinking back now, I can remember a moment that really sticks out. My mother bought me a pair of sweatpants and a sweatshirt, but since the store didn't have the right size in boys, she bought the girls one because sweat pants are sweat pants. I was...strangely giddy and happy about it, thought I didn't let on to anyone.)

Fast forward to a year or so ago and I was sobbing into a pillow one night because I had a goatee that I liked - except for when I was feeling more feminine. I spent a lot of time thinking about it and realized that the masculine side of me could be happy with or without it, but the feminine side of absolutely detested it. The feeling of rightness when I shaved it off... I was so happy. I've begun to wear women's clothing around the house after my son goes to bed some nights. (Though not during the day because I just don't feel like trying to explain that I'm genderfuid to a 6 year old. He'd probably take it pretty well, but I'm not out to anyone except my wife and he's got a big mouth. :D ) I even chose a name for when I'm feminine - Ivy. Though that took months to decide on.

The reason I think I'm genderfluid and not, say trans, is because I don't mind being a guy. Most of the time it's great being a guy, but some days I just wish that I wasn't. What I find interesting is that while I often will feel one way or the other, if I'm feeling masculine I can absolutely trigger my feminine side coming out, but not the other way around.

Anyway. I kind of feel like I'm rambling, but I don't really have many people to talk to about all this. I'm very shy about it for the most part and am by nature a very private person.

I really wish I have a more ""masculine"" haircut, a bit more deeper voice and use androgynous style, that's how I see myself in the future. But, at the same time, I want to feel somehow connected to my assigned gender (female), to feminity, she/her pronouns and ""girl-ish"" stuff.

I also feel connected to gender-neutral and... partially male identity too. Sometimes even disconnected to any gender. I'm okay being called an enby person, girl or boy. That's totally fine. I can go by any pronouns. My given name always seemed kinda... wrong? too, if that changes anything.

What's bothering me is that, those ""gender feelings"" come, sometimes, all at once. All at once and sometimes some of them not so strongly. And also sometimes I don't feel all of them at the same time; at times, just two or one of them. Is it weird??

I think I am experiencing dysphoria, but it's not strong enough to make me have crisis or something. I feel uncomfortable only with my chest since I was 12, I've always been hiding behind sportive bras. But not that I wish they were ""masculine"", just waaay smaller.

I've searched about genderfluid, but I have some questions about it. Like, can I ""genderfluid"" to more than one gender at once? Or that sometimes I ""genderfluid"" to more than one gender and they variate in intensity?

I'm just now getting up the courage to publicly embrace a more masc/butch look. I have this unfortunate body (think Venus of Willendorf but with a face and a marginally smaller abdomen), so I'll probably never be masc ""passing"", but I want an androgynous hairstyle and to wear more ""mens'"" clothes and possibly, sometimes, a binder.

I'm 33, amab, and only recently(ish) realized I was gender fluid. I've been blessed with a hugely supportive partner, community, and siblings. Even my ex is supportive (which is important due to the below)

My main hurdle before I'm able to fully live as myself is my kid. She's almost 6, and is at a stage where she's seeing the world in gendered tones. Hard to explain well but basically she's worked out that she's a girl, and that boys exist and are different, and that some of my friends aren't boys or girls but in between/other. All of this is pretty normal developmentally.  She's only familiar with me as my male self, but she's perceptive enough to have quickly caught on that i am happier now. 

So, does anyone know of any good resources for talking about it and helping answer her questions? I literally have to explain it like she's 5, and everything i can find via Google is geared at parents of [trans/fluid/NB/and beyond] children vs situations where it's the parent coming out. 

Her mother and i aren't together, but shes supportive and is letting me lead the conversation with the kiddo.

2020-07-16 15:04:59,hsb83v,4,1,"Hey y'all. 25 AMAB, for context. Sorry for the very long post.

So for as long as I can recall, I've been dressing in female clothes, for the longest time as a crossdresser (though I'm not especially fond of some of the word's connotations). It was always something I did privately, and largely for sexual gratification. I sometimes wondered if I could be trans, but it came and went, and I didn't have any notable body dysphoria (besides the fact that I wasn't terribly attractive, and was slightly overweight). My strongest feeling of being trans was about 15 years ago, when I was in the car and suddenly wished, intensely, that I had a pair of breasts for my seatbelt to be pressing between. The feeling went away though, and I didn't feel anything quite so strong since - my thoughts became far more along the lines of 'it'd be fascinating to try out being female', rather than 'I'm a girl in a boy's body'.

Fast-forward to about two months ago - now far less overweight and a bit more attractive, and far more comfortable in my own body than I had been before I lost weight. I'm at uni now, doing a part-time PhD, so I'm in that for the long haul. I've just moved from one shared house to another, and because of the way things worked out, I knew I would have about a month and a half of living on my own before my new housemates could move in. 

At this point, I thought I could potentially stand a chance at passing in public because of the common wearing of masks due to Covid-19, and the thought and planning that went into that made me realise how much I wanted it - and that I might be genderfluid. I wasn't certain at first because, y'know, identity can be a hard thing to figure out. Ultimately I ended up shaving off my beard and arm hair (since I'd be able to regrow it before anyone moved in), where before I'd only shaved my legs. I bought a few nicer pieces of female clothing, including a 2 sizes larger bra that gives me a proportionate bust. I also acquired some makeup for the first time (although I still have some way to go), and I learned how to tuck. Over the first few weeks realised that I could certainly consider myself genderfluid, and I no longer questioned whether I was imagining things or being indulgent. I've been out dressed a few times now, to the shops and to the park. As an unexpected bonus, I also realised that I actually didn't hate the stubbly look when I felt male either, a look I'd long thought wouldn't suit me - I felt attrective, in a way.

That's been my last month or so, but in the last few days (at around the same time as I joined Reddit, though I can't say which came first), I've had incredibly strong feelings of transness, like it's something I desperately want and need. I desparately want to grow breasts and to feminise my face (the breasts part isn't entirely new, but it's not often been this strong). It's incredibly confusing because I still don't really feel a significant sense of body dysmorphia towards my male self. Like, when I feel more female I wish my chin were a bit more pointed/rounded, my brows less heavy and my stubble gone, things that would help me pass - but I also don't hate my penis, and I really don't mind being a guy. I also don't suffer from a lot of the mental struggles that a lot of trans folk mention. I can feel a very full range of emotions, especially towards the happier end of the  spectrum - I'm very rarely sad, and I've definitely never felt suicidal (I'm far too much of a gift to the world). 

Everything above makes things so confusing. If I don't mind being a guy, why does this need feel so desperate so suddenly. I'll look at r/transitiontimelines and think that it's not too late for me to transition and pass, and perhaps even look attractive (while also knowing that I've left it later than most). The thought that I could make the change by the time I graduate, and could do so as a female, makes me feel quite giddy. I also know that I'm unlikely to get a better chance - I know that my friends and family would support me (in part, why I haven't come out to anyone about being genderfluid - perversely, knowing that they would accept and love me just the same means I haven't felt a strong need to before the last few days). I have four more years of my PhD in which I could transition before I enter the wider world. My face has masculine features, although my lips are quite feminine and as a man I've always held them in a bit because I think it looks better -  but otherwise I'm relatively androgynous, and my height (5ft 8.5in) and shoe size (UK women's 8) are, at the least, not against me. 

On the other hand, I still relieve myself sexually, and whenever I do I almost certainly feel more masculine, like the whole idea is a mistake and I'm actually genderfluid at best. Sometimes a similar thought occurs randomly, suggesting to me the same. I painted my nails a few days ago, and couldn't find any nail-polish remover in the shop yesterday to take it off again. In such a moment, I scratched the polish off on one of my fingers, but I couldn't bring myself to carry on - but I also haven't been able to face the prospect of repainting it. I'm in limbo, and it feels like the choice of which way I go is very much a substitute for which way my real gender identity lies

TL:DR - I don't really mind being a guy, and don't feel depressed or suicidal. I recently realised was genderfluid, but over the last few days I've felt a desperate need to transition to female. The feeling sometimes vanishes, especially after relieving myself, but it also comes back. It's incredibly confusing - does anyone have any similar experience that might make it less so?

If you haven’t, would you? 

Story time:

For me, I had so many reasons. I had a very male identity at the time (so much so that I thought I might’ve just been trans, but I guess that’s what genderfluid can be sometimes. Fluid.)
I was getting sick of feeling “like the girl” in my “hetero” relationship. I was sick of my controlling boyfriend at the time telling me what I could and couldn’t do. A few months prior I had wanted to dye my hair (like I had been doing frequently the years prior but I had natural-ish hair at the time) and all my new friends and ex-bf said not to. I cried. A lot. 
I was sick of my stupid severe depression episode. And missing so much school because of it. My abusive home life. Still in it, but man it’s especially bad when you’re a teenager. 
And overall I just needed a change. (I won’t lie when I say I might’ve been a LITTLE inspired by eleven of stranger things.)

Everyone thought I had cancer. I got told by my not-so-good of a father “why don’t you take care of yourself?” as if me shaving my head was THAT BAD of a thing. But who tf cares. I let them say whatever. 

I started going through switches a lot and my dysphoria towards both binary genders started acting up a lot, as well. I wore wigs often and they were fun, though. 

Once I started seeing my counselor in highschool, her and I figured that we should probably tell my teachers what was going on with me since I was missing so much school. My now-favourite teacher from highschool pulled me aside after class once just to talk alone. I had heard rumours about him forever (he would sometimes take full semesters off with no explanation.) 

He spoke to me extremely caring and about his own experience. About how he would leave for a long time sometimes, and about how this, along with his bald head, convinced everyone that he had cancer. Well, he had never told anyone else that he had been suffering from depression for a long time. It’s such a strange thing to have in common, but that remains one of the most comforting experiences I’ve ever had. 

It was liberating, but it was also painful. But I don’t regret it. Never will. 

I hope your experience has been extraordinary as well. Reclaiming your body and yourself is extremely rewarding. :) &lt;3

I also used to really wish that I was a woman so that I could have lesbian sex, which seemed to be objectively better and more intimate to me.

A little background, I am a 25 yo guy. I'm very masculine presenting, with a beard, receding hairline, and tall (although I don't want to give exact measurements, I'm above 6'2) among other things. Basically there's no way you'd look at me and not see a guy. I'm bi but that part of me stays constant.

So I essentially have 3 main ""phases"" (they aren't phases in the sense of ""it's just a phase"" kinda thing, but not sure how else to word it.) 1) I am happy with who I am. I enjoy being a guy and don't tend to think of myself of anything else. 2) I recognize I am a guy but get jealous of women. Not of the person, but that they get to be female. I find myself wanting to be them, nothing sexual or like wanting to be them on a personal level, I just want to be in their body. My mind, but in a female body. During this I don't hate my body or have any desire to change it, but also recognize that I would be just as happy if not happier in a female body. And 3) I hate my body and refer to myself in my head with a female name and wish desperately that I could change. Admittedly this is relatively rare, and rarely occurs on its own, typically I get into this headspace after being in headspace 2 for a while. But it's sometimes a toss up between 1 and 2. Sometimes I can go weeks or months in one thought process, other times it changes almost daily. 

Nothing else about me or my personality really changes, other than I have been starting to experiment with make up and I typically only want to do anything with makeup during mindset 2, not 1. But other than that I am the same person, it's not like it's various personas or anything. 

If you have any suggestions, advice, or general comments, I'd love to hear your thoughts. Again I just wanted to kind of get this out in the open because I've been working a lot on allowing myself to be me, and this is a big part of that.",genderfluid,Trying to figure myself out,1595282127.0,"{'created_utc': 1595256927, 'id': 'humo77', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 6, 'selftext': 'So this is probably gonna be a little long-winded, and I\'m not really sure what I will accomplish by putting this out there, but I\'ve been trying to figure out myself for a while and figured maybe getting it out of my head and into the world might help. \n\nA little background, I am a 25 yo guy.

**By: Pluto** 

The children heaved and swirled, undulating like a flock of crows around an unseen center. Individually, the energy was frenetic, but as a mass there seemed intention in the murmuration. Bobby watched from the sidelines, attempting to find peace in the body, without being distracted by the dances of one or pairs. 

If Bobby unfocused their eyes, it reminded them of pinwheels. Spinning too fast for the patterns and colors to stand on their own, becoming a calming blur, a mesh of everything in-between. Bobby felt a likeness to the blur. It didn’t divorce itself from the pieces that composed it, but it wasn’t defined by them either. It swirled around until the red circles strode aside the blue and white stars in equal proportion. 

Bobby had never felt comfortable in their own skin. There were cosmetic pieces they wished they could rearrange: the way one ear hung lower than the other, the roundness of their jaw line, the pointed scar on their cheek where their sister’s nail had cut a little too deep. But Bobby had never felt like a passenger in a strangers body. To them it was a vessel, an expression outside their control, and they felt a deep kinship with its parts and pieces. 

What bothered Bobby most about their body, were the expectations other people attached to it. When Bobby let these expectations in, their weight would make them wish they could smooth out their edges, flatten their curves, and erase any identifiable characteristics that other people could latch on to. In these moments, Bobby wished they could become grey and unremarkable. 

In reality, there was no absence in Bobby’s identity. They *weren’t* grey or unremarkable. They *were* a smattering of distinct characteristics, all of which they expressed loudly, and whom together comprised the symphony of Bobby. 

“Loud &amp; Proud” their mother would affectionately tell people, but Bobby didn’t feel their mother understood what she meant when she said that. Their mother was sweet, most of the time she used their proper pronouns, but mostly Bobby felt their mother thought they were simply gay and a bit different. To most, the symphony of Bobby sounded like a confusing cacophony of conflicting gender traits.

When confronted with Bobby’s identity, many took it as a challenge, searching for the secret they assumed Bobby hid behind their coded pronouns. To them, Bobby was a tangled string, that if unraveled, would have a hidden penis or clitoris dangling from one end. Others, thought their pronouns were a badge that Bobby wore, to make themself feel special. There were even those who believed they were supportive of Bobby’s identity, but expected androgyny, holding Bobby’s personality or interests against them. They would tally characteristics into columns, trying to solve Bobby’s equation with math. 

Boxes, so many boxes.  

Bobby closed their eyes and ran their hand through their hair. A mop of burgundy curls, pinned back with a series of black skulls and blue butterfly clips. They let out a sigh and, before re-introducing their eyes to the sunlight, adjusted the frames of their circular glasses. 

When Bobby was stressed, this is where they’d come: set themself quietly on a bench at the edge of the park, unfocus, and bathe in the swirling color. Bobby felt a likeness to the children, but an equal measure of envy. The children weren’t without gender and neither was Bobby; their expression was grounded in personality, largely unconditional, and unrestricted. But the children existed in a state of pre-definition: their energies malleable, their potential unexpressed, and the rules, which would govern their identities as f*uture-people,* conceived, but still gestating. Their actions weren’t tethered to a sense of responsibility, they simply projected their internal experience. Bobby envied that freedom. 

Maybe it was time to move. 

Like most queer kids, Bobby had fleeting thoughts of elsewhere. They’d picture a cosmopolitan utopia, far off and massive, that would swaddle them in the comfort of true acceptance and understanding, holding them away from the burning flames of their former lives. On less optimistic days, Bobby settled for a fantasy of disappearing into the insignificance of a crowd. These moments always passed. Bobby refused to let their identity steer the ship. 

Passing a final glance over the children, Bobby smirked, stood, and began to wander farther down the park path. The sun beat down on the back of their neck as they walked. The day was unseasonably warm and in stark contrast with the week of rain that had preceded it. The path’s ridges and indents were still filled with water, it’s edges alit with freshly opened flowers, marking the now-passed storm. A hundred yards from where Bobby had been sitting, they paused, catching their reflection in a puddle. 

Reaching up, Bobby watched as the muddy-double touched the familiar curve of unfamiliar lips. Painted blue, the lips quivered at the touch. The fingers moved to the pink shadows adorning their eyelids, which peeled down, wicking away the hints of freshly brewed tears. Bobby bit their lip, stemming the flood of confusing emotions that were trying to express themselves. Bobby decided to sort their emotional suppression into the ‘male’ column. 

The thought brought another smirk, which the muddy-double returned.  

Bobby brought their black boot down in the water, splashing the muddy-double out of existence, and twisting their ankle for good measure. On the air of their verberation, chin held high, Bobby strode away, leaving the path behind, in favor of the under-footing of freshly bloomed flowers.",genderfluid,"They, Them",1595324110.0,"{'created_utc': 1595298910, 'id': 'huz98y', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 3, 'selftext': '**They, Them** \n\n**By: Pluto** \n\nThe children heaved and swirled, undulating like a flock of crows around an unseen center.

I've been battling with some horrible imposter syndrome that dragged me down to the bottom of the pit.

Again, I completely understand how she is feeling, I don't blame her for this in the slightest.

And yesterday i sent them randomly a pic of me where i was wearing a white men tank top and baggy shorts , and they started saying “ oh you look like a lesbian now , you reached your final form” , “ ohh your masculine side is showing !! Love it !!” , “ ohh you look like you’re tryna send a strap pic “ ..... i immediately taught to myself ugh heteros back at it again.
I addressed the fact that they shouldn’t see someone who hasn’t asked anything specific to them to point out gender related stuff ... like i literally never specifically said i was trying to look more masculine or needed encouragement for that.I also said its not okay to see a non straight and / or cis person and immediately think about sex unless you’re tryna have sex with them.I think heteros get too comfortable sometimes.
I also said some of the things they said were offensive, they could not be offensive to me ( bc honestly i have very low expectations with straight ppl ) but i really see how hurtful those comments can be to someone else.They think its okay for them to point that out bc to them i was more “feminine “back then.

2020-07-23 22:23:01,hwphks,9,5,"So, background...

Last autumn I came out to my wife as wanting to express more as feminine when my gender was more female, as I'd been having some of the worst dysphoria of my life. Things didn't go so well back then. Our lowest point came when I was in so much pain that I went onto antidepressants without first consulting her, and partly as a result of how useless I was when adjusting to them she asked her dad about what would happen if we got divorced (though she didn't tell him why).

When I found out it made me feel as though I had a Sword of Damocles over my head, because she would likely get the house, custody of our child, and alimony. I felt powerless, like a hostage in my own marriage. I had never felt more uncertain about the future of our marriage, the life of our (at the time) 9-month old child, and my life in general. We had a lot of difficult discussions, and both began working to come back from that point.

We took it slow. I would experiment on occasion, then I came up with the idea of wearing beaded bracelets to indicate my gender so she could get used to me visibly signalling how I felt, and then we agreed for me to have a dedicated evening a week when I could, if I wanted, experiment without first telling her. All of this, especially the last, was in an effort to normalise it.

And before ***anyone*** says it sounds like she's really controlling, she's not. She was struggling and still is, and her feelings are as valid as mine. She's worried that being genderfluid is just a stopover for me becoming a trans woman, and she's not sure she can handle that level of change. She didn't sign up for that when we got married, and she'd never thought of herself as anything but cishet.

Over the last several months she asked more and more questions about how I feel on a given day, about when I feel the need to dress en femme, whether I want to get a wig and what style. Things have been moving in an overall positive direction. But it's not all sunshine and gay rainbows.

A couple of weeks ago I said to her that I wanted her to stop reiterating that she wouldn't be able to handle me if I was any more feminine (i.e. worried I was becoming a binary trans woman), and, relatedly, that I didn't want her to reflexively clarify that I mean **sometimes** when I say things like, ""Damn, I wish I had Scarlett Johansson's figure."" Her feelings *were* valid, and we talked about it and she agreed to stop when I promised her that I always do mean **sometimes**, because I didn't *start* my journey thinking I was genderfluid: I started thinking I was a binary trans woman, but that didn't fit.

At the same time I told her that I would like for her to try and put aside the idea that she can't be attracted to me when I'm en femme. I asked her to open her mind to the possibility that she could be both heterosexual and demisexual-for-me, and that it was completely valid; she didn't have to give up the idea that she was attracted to me, or that she was attracted to me, because both were possible at the same time. She was noncommittal, but the seed had been planted and my patience had been rewarded before.

**And now we get to tonight...**

She came into my office toward the end of the day and said,

&gt;""I was thinking of throwing this out, but maybe you'd want it? It might look good on you.""

And she put one of her pashminas around my neck, and stepped back with a smile. She suggested an outfit combo. And before my eyes could well up I took her hand and hugged her. I wasn't wearing my bracelets, so she didn't know I was feeling masc (demiboy, really), but it didn't matter. i felt so validated.

We chatted for a few moments about how I only feel I need fake boobs when the dysphoria is really bad, and then she smiled and said,

&gt;""Maybe what I like *will* change over time. I always try to be open to new things.""

My heart is still a melted puddle in my chest.

So yeah...

My boss and work colleagues has been very supportive - I work freelance in television production so I'm far from the 'weirdest' thing they've ever encountered. Plus there is a FtM Trans-person working in the company so they have handled the situation before. However, I'm unsure how to approach the pronoun and name situation. 

I've decided to keep my male (legal) name for professional reasons, so my emails etc will remain in my male name, and I don't mind my colleagues addressing me as he/him or my male name. However, whenever I'm presenting as female, I do have a female name but I'm unsure if I should request they use that name and she/her pronouns. 

I did meet up with my current colleague recently for a socially-distanced drink in a park. I have worked with some of them before on other projects, but some of them were new to me and I'd never met them before. I presented female to this meet-up and some of my very well-meaning colleagues introduced me to a couple of people I'd not met in my female name, but I felt compelled to also mention the male side as that's what my email address says and how they would know me in their inbox! Plus I felt if they knew me as female, it gave them the impression that I was transitioning to be female full-time, which isn't what I'm doing.

In March of 2017 I actually came out to my girlfriend as questioning if was genderfluid, but then I somehow just forgot about it 😅

I realized I was trans in October 2019, and initially thought I was genderfluid as well. I kept feeling like I was a guy, and being confused about why I thought I was trans in the first place, and then feeling gender euphoria about being a woman and thinking “ah, that’s why”. After a few weeks, I stopped having those moments of feeling like a guy, so I figured it was just confusion, and I started identifying as a binary trans woman. 

Over the last month, I’ve started having moments of heightened awareness of my gender. I’ll just suddenly realize I feel like a guy. It didn’t feel bad, and I started thinking I might be Genderfluid again. However, over the last few weeks I’ve realized that I desperately *want* to feel like a woman when I don’t. Today I felt like a guy earlier, and it was actually fairly distressing. Now, I feel genderless, and that’s a bit more peaceful, but I’d still prefer to feel like a woman. 

I feel like the fact that I’m not really okay with feeling like the other genders means it’s less likely to be gender fluidity and more likely to be dysphoria, but most other trans people I’ve been talking to don’t seem to have such a strong and shifting sense of gender. 

My questions are the following:

1. Do you ever feel like a certain gender, but you wish you didn’t? Basically, does the fact that I consistently want to feel like a woman mean that this isn’t gender fluidity, it’s dysphoria, or is this normal?

2. I know you can’t tell me “you’re genderfluid” or not, but what do you make of my situation and experiences? (If not, do you have any advice for other non-binary identities to look into? Bigender doesn’t seem to fit)

I’ve been trying to understand and come to terms with my gender for about 7 years. There are big signs all the way from infancy that I was uncomfortable with being cis. I tried to blend in when I was a teen and as the years went on I started dressing more and more like the opposite gender and I would feel quite uncomfortable in my body etc and constantly wonder am I trans etc. It crossed my mind about being genderfluid but I think that was almost harder to accept than being trans (bc i understand it less? Maybe). I tend to feel uncomfortable in myself, if I’m depressed. I don’t think I experience dysphoria other than when I’m already down, it’s more just wishing I was the opposite gender. Or perhaps it’s more wishing that people saw me as the opposite gender or treated me that way. Is it a direct reaction to misogyny?

Sometimes I think is it all just poor mental health and self acceptance issues and I am in fact cis?

I’ll also add -having been out as gay for ten years comfortably and kind of finding I have a lot of dislike/frustration towards men/patriarchy may be influencing this resistance towards accepting my identity.

Can anyone advise/share similar experience?

2020-07-27 02:07:21,hyjldb,0,1,"Hey all! I really never want to make someone else feel like their identity is invalid or that the way they express themselves is invalid, and lately I've been around/participated in much talk regarding the fetishization of trans people, (specifically transmasc individuals) and I think its awesome that people are being called out for their bullshit!

Though I am aware there exist some particular keywords that people tend to use in terms of a fetish, i.e. 'trap' or 'femboy'. I personally believe 'trap' is more harmful, as it dehumanizes trans girls. As far as 'femboy', I typically use that word to mean simply a feminine boy, which I think is more of gender expression as opposed to identity or orientation or anything like that. 

My question is: is it okay to use the term 'femboy'? I have come to label my identity as being a genderfluid boy, as in my gender is still fluid, and I do experience times where I feel I align perfectly with 'girl', 'agender', or 'both'. However most of the time, I do feel most aligned with 'boy'. Sometimes I will feel more feminine, but as a boy (does that make sense?) so I like to adopt the word 'femboy' and dress in a more ""girly"" way while still identifying as a guy.

I stopped hormones a week ago because of how unsure I was. I also didn’t like how I was constantly worried about not passing. Hrt brought really positive changes to my mind (less anger, less anxiety, laughed more) but I didn’t have a lot of energy or appetite and my sex drive was gone, so I worried the pros weren’t outweighing the cons. It got to the point that when I was presenting female everyday I started to miss the boy me. I’d wash my makeup off, look in the mirror, and break down cuz I felt like I was burying someone I loved.

I consider myself non-binary, but I experience my gender identity changing regularly. So, that lead me to think that I might be genderfluid instead. 

In essence, I am looking for ways in which you deal with dysphoria, if you experience it. Especially if you do not have the opportunity to dress the way you want during your daily lives. 
I'm AMAB, but I do not dress overly masculine to begin with. Still, on days that I feel more femme, I really want to just wear feminine clothes and makeup and have long hair and a feminine voice. But that is just not really an option in my line of work atm.

2020-07-29 09:41:18,hzxtko,0,1,"Being bigender and living as transgender is so, so, hard.

It really hurts me when you call me the gender of my body, call me words like ""man"", ""dude"", ""sir"", ""he"", and ""him"", when my energy is not strong enough to stand up to those vocalized judgements of what you think I really am.

In the moments in-between taking these hard blows to my confidence in my trans-female gender identity, my female side continues to flash back to life, often only as weak, desperate, flickers.

I'm actually trying really really hard to protect and guide this currently-female soul that is the consciousness currently most central to piloting this large, awkward, and currently kind-of-unhealthy partly-physically transitioned XY body, and your pointed reminders that you see me as the opposite gender to the one that is most readily available and functioning are NOT helping me to look after and nurse this precious, fragile, soft, and timid side of my soul.

*-dusk, Tuesnight morning, November 5th \[(of yr. 2019)\]*

P.S. Though, don't get me wrong, I do not mind at all being gendered as male when **(a)** I have enough energy and confidence to keep my internal, 'hidden' identity separate from that external one which you impose on me, **(b)**, you misgender me non-violently, as a sort of 'reminder' that my female side had fallen asleep, and actually help probe me awake again, and **(c)** when you actually catch a flash of my *male* soul-energy in one of its (much rarer) brief moments of resurgence to life.

All-in=all, misgendering can be bad, or neutrally non-impeding, or, in some cases, even *helpful*, and above all, I wish now to re-emphasize the deep power of the common saying:

""It's not just *what* you say,

but *how* you say it.""

TL;DR

bigender = 2 modes of life: male, and female.

transgender as XY = living in female-soul mode despite having a body that is chromosomally mostly male.

Nursing my female side in this XY body is very hard and scary, and she/I is often but a\~\~n\~\~ \~\~occasionally\~\~ barely sputtering flicker.

My male side is an even less stably-recurring flicker, which unlike my currently dominant female side does not flash to life as a cycling string of moments throughout my day, but only rarely, and sometimes not at all for days, weeks, and nowadays, sometimes even months.

for the last few months I have identified as a lesbian demigirl because I felt connected to being a girl and be non-binary while being attracted to females. However I do not feel that the term demigirl accurately describes how I feel.

There are times where I feel completely non-binary and there are times where I feel Like a woman (I'm AFAB). I feel so 0 connection or attraction to masculinity in my gender sexuality or romantic orientation. Because of this I sometimes identify as a lesbian and I still have to identify as a Trixic(non binary attracted to woman). I'd say I'm mostly identified as a lesbian just because I have a girlfriend  who identifies as a lesbian and she is okay with me identifying on the non-binary. I guess the term gender fluid describes how I feel I feel fluid between females and non-binary depending on the day and I kind of my mood. I would say the two closes identities are demigirl and gender-fluid. However when I think of gender-fluid my mind automatically goes to fluid between man and woman I do realize that this is actually not the definition of gender fluid I'm just struggling with how I feel. part of me wants to continue to identify as a demigirl because I don't want to lose my connection to being feminine and femininity however I also feel a strong connection to non-binary.
