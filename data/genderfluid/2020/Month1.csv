It's not that I particularly dislike my body or who I am when I'm in a more masculine mode. But sometimes, or a lot of times right now, I just feel so much *better* in a more feminine mode. 

Ive worn skirts around the house on and off for a few years, and I've always felt a little happier while wearing them, but I attributed it to just being quirky and ""why should skirts be a fem only thing anyway?"" which I still hold to, any clothing should be worn by anyone who likes it.

Lately though that's turned into a few skirts, a few dresses, leggings and even a bra, which I change into most days as soon as I get home from work and just feel so much better. Ive even started painting nails at the weekends and every time I glimpse them I get a little burst of joy. 

Shaving has become a big part of my routine too, and a start with epilating in an attempt to spend less time on it.

It's all given me a deeper connection to a side of myself that just feels much more feminine, and in honesty even on my more masculine days, I feel kind of down that I'm not in a more feminine mode.

What I’m still having a lot of trouble figuring out however, is the appropriate language to use when referring exclusively to sex and how it clearly delineates the reference to sex vs gender. 

Traditionally gendered language like Male, Female, Man, Woman, Masculine, Feminine assumed that sex and gender were interdependent - of course that’s not the case, but I’m not clear on which of these terms are meant to be used for one or the other - or if there are new terms being developed to make the delineation between sex and gender more clear. 

What I’m sort of looking for is a framework like:

Sex:

“Term to refer to an organism that has biological characteristics generally associated with being “male” 

“Term to refer to an organism that has biological characteristics generally associated with being “intersex”

“Term to refer to an organism that has biological characteristics generally associated with being “female” 

Terms to refer to any fringe cases not covered in the above 3 scenarios

I’ve been coming to the conclusion lately that what I’m about to describe may be why I have such a difficult time defining my personal style, and why I always seem to be flip-flopping what I want my outward aesthetic to look like. 

I’m sure we’ve all seen musicians/actors/characters on TV and thought to ourselves, “Wow, I’d kill to look like them.” Since I was a kid, I (22F) have always been drawn to (mainly male) characters and felt this underlying urge that I wanted to look like them, or even embody or “be” them in a sense. Maybe it was their masculine energy, maybe it was just the way they portrayed themselves with confidence, maybe it was their smooth talking or their charisma. Whatever it may be, I still never felt I were any gender other than female, despite me idolizing male characters and admiring them for whatever traits I happened to like about them. 

Now, that doesn’t mean that I suddenly changed my appearance to match theirs. I still like to think that I have some sense of self-identity and I definitely don’t want to be a clone of anyone, but it’s just usually a thought that pops through my mind like, “Hm. Yeah. I would definitely not mind if I looked like that.” 

I also do it with females occasionally, but with females it’s less about their overall energy and more just that if they’re really pretty, sometimes I wish I could look like them because I know attractiveness goes far in this world.

To give an example, I’ve been rewatching The Vampire Diaries lately, and I’ve caught myself at times wishing I was as pretty as Nina Dobrev, and then other times I found myself subconsciously thinking the same thing (probably even more so) about Ian Somerhalder.

I don’t know what this means — if it even means anything — or what to do about it. If I’m female, why do I look at these male characters and feel such a strong urge to embody their masculine energy or have a masculine appearance? I don’t ever do this with masculine-presenting female characters, only male.

I’m bisexual, and it makes me wrestle with how I should approach my style and date. I know guys tend to prefer me with longer hair, so the more feminine side of me wrestles with growing my hair out, while the more masculine side of me wants to keep it chopped. Half of me wants to wear fishnet stockings and plaid skirts and high heels, another part of me wants to wear men’s jeans and men’s shirts. You get the idea.

What does this mean, that I need to essentially buy two wardrobes depending on how I feel that day? Does this sound familiar to anyone, or can anyone explain perhaps why I feel like this?",genderfluid,"since I was little, i’ve always caught Myself looking at Attractive men &amp; women and wished I looked like them. i Don’t Know what this means, but because of this i’m constantly wrestling with how i feel my appearance should look.

Whatever it may be, I still never felt I were any gender other than female, despite me idolizing male characters and admiring them for whatever traits I happened to like about them. \n\nNow, that doesn’t mean that I suddenly changed my appearance to match theirs. I still like to think that I have some sense of self-identity and I definitely don’t want to be a clone of anyone, but it’s just usually a thought that pops through my mind like, “Hm. Yeah. I would definitely not mind if I looked like that.” \n\nI also do it with females occasionally, but with females it’s less about their overall energy and more just that if they’re really pretty, sometimes I wish I could look like them because I know attractiveness goes far in this world.\n\nTo give an example, I’ve been rewatching The Vampire Diaries lately, and I’ve caught myself at times wishing I was as pretty as Nina Dobrev, and then other times I found myself subconsciously thinking the same thing (probably even more so) about Ian Somerhalder.\n\nI don’t know what this means — if it even means anything — or what to do about it. If I’m female, why do I look at these male characters and feel such a strong urge to embody their masculine energy or have a masculine appearance? I don’t ever do this with masculine-presenting female characters, only male.\n\nI’m bisexual, and it makes me wrestle with how I should approach my style and date. I know guys tend to prefer me with longer hair, so the more feminine side of me wrestles with growing my hair out, while the more masculine side of me wants to keep it chopped. Half of me wants to wear fishnet stockings and plaid skirts and high heels, another part of me wants to wear men’s jeans and men’s shirts. You get the idea.\n\nWhat does this mean, that I need to essentially buy two wardrobes depending on how I feel that day? Does this sound familiar to anyone, or can anyone explain perhaps why I feel like this?', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'since I was little, i’ve always caught Myself looking at Attractive men &amp; women and wished I looked like them. i Don’t Know what this means, but because of this i’m constantly wrestling with how i feel my appearance should look.

2020-01-08 09:28:55,elqite,3,1,"I'm a little embarrassed, but I would like to share my story, since it's been quite a few years since this started. Any opinions or personal experiences would be nice to hear.

First of all, I grew up in a very closed off and strict Christian household. I was born a female. I didn't know the LGBT+ community existed until I was at least 12. That is, I didn't even know girls could kiss each other. It literally never crossed my mind. I am now 19, about to be 20. As you can probably tell, I haven't had much time to think about this. My best friend at the time was pansexual, and she opened my eyes to this world. When that happened, I began to explore my sexuality and gender identity.

 At first, I realized I didn't feel like any gender at all. I identified as non-binary for a long time, at least with my friends and therapist. But soon, I began getting into relationships with men, and while I do like men and women the same, I don't like the way some men look at me, or change their attitude once we started dating. Like they were looking at me and talking to me like I was their woman. I would break up with them over this, and it made me feel as though I would like it if my partner saw me as a man.

 My whole life, I felt as though I didn't fit in with girls my age. When I was little, I had a fit that lasted a few months, where I insisted my father called me ""son,"" just like my brother, along with other things. This made me realize, maybe I was trans. It felt like everything made sense. I felt massive dysphoria, even cutting my hair to my scalp, buying binders, asking my friends to call me by a male name, and after 2 years of being 100% sure I was a FtM transgender, came out to my Christian family.

 They rejected me, still calling me by my female name and female pronouns. At first, I hated this to no end, but after years of trying, I gave up, and  I'm now used to being called female terms again. My friends call me by my preferred name, while everyone else in the world calls me by the name I was born with. I don't even bother coming out to new people I meet or become close to.

As this went along, things started to change. I stopped hating the way I looked. I grew out my hair again, and it's now at my shoulders. Sometimes when I looked in the mirror, I felt gender neutral again, then I felt masculine, and then I felt feminine. It confused me to no end. Didn't I just come out as transgender? Aren't I a fraud? Why am I fine with female pronouns now?

Then, I started getting close with a girl. She was lovely, accepted me for who I was, although I never spoke to her about these feelings of gender fluidity. Anyone I spoke of this to looked at me like I was crazy. She just accepted I was transgender, which was so wonderful in it's own right. But... As I started liking her more and more, I started feeling very feminine. To the point where I was almost sure I was really a female. Thinking things like 'maybe I'm actually cis?' 'was this all fake?' and 'am i really just a fool?' But after we broke up, I immediately went back to feeling masculine, more so non-binary than anything.

It dawned on me that maybe the people I associate with very closely actually effect the way I feel gender wise... I feel masculine when with a boy, feminine with a girl, and non-binary or male when I'm single. But that is insane, isn't it?

I wanted to ask here to hear any of your thoughts. Do you also get affected by those around you? By what I've told you, do you believe I'm genderfluid? Or am I just insane?

2020-01-12 00:16:24,enfuvu,1,1,"Hey all. I'm George, new to this sub. 

I recently came out as gay (homoflexible), 27 years old. Was openly bi on high school and then an 8 year addiction made me asexual and celibate. But I've been clean for 18 months now!

Now, gender has always been really confusing for me, and so had sexuality. I pretended to be asexual and agender for a long time because I refused to talk about either one.

I'm starting to realize and come to terms with the fact that I'm non-binary and possibly gender fluid.

I hate the binary system, and I have dysphoria directly from it. I feel trapped and forced into a box I don't understand. I don't have genital dysphoria, I'm fine with what I have, but it doesn't make me feel any more 'male' neither does my mustache.

I sometimes look on the mirror and think 'you rock that look today.' On days where I feel my identity align with my sex. Since I'm not out about my gender in public yet, it's a bit hard for me to start looking different.

But other times I look in the mirror and I would rather be wearing makeup and tight jeans or a skirt, and have gorgeous hair, and a low cut blouse. Sometimes I feel genderless and don't care how I look, sometimes I feel like I'm make and female and want to appear androgynous. Sometimes I feel like all genders and that's a little distressing. Or anywhere else on the spectrum.

It changes daily sometimes. Sometimes I'll feel like a male for a couple weeks. Sometimesit changes throughout the day.
 
I don't really 'get' gender. I just want to dress and look the way I feel comfortable. But because society is heteronormative, it's taboo. And since I currently live in a smaller town, it's harder.

Thanks if you read all that, and any feedback would be welcomed!

2020-01-12 16:51:12,enptj9,5,1,"Okay, I’m AFAB(20) and genderfluid, and I know I want to come out. My partner, who I’m currently dating,  in Trans and Non Binary (21), but I’m still terrified of coming out to them and I don’t know why. I’m struggling to decipher what is legitimate concern and what’s just my own panic, and I guess I just want a second opinion. 

We haven’t been dating long, only a few months, and when we met I had gone back to being certain I was cis. I have a long history of questioning my gender, which I told them about before we were dating. Iv always had the “subconscious” knowledge I was genderfluid, but I shift genders very slowly and over long periods of time and I can go for months very content as either male, female or neither before gradually shifting back around. This can make it very hard to accept that I’m fluid because I am so certain when I’m one gender that I will be that forever. But after 5 years of going back and forth and round in circles, I’m accepting that I’m never going to settle on one gender and I am genderfluid. 

I desperately didn’t want to be genderfluid for ages, I think mainly due to my school years. There was another person at my school who was out as genderfluid, and they were ridiculed for it constantly. They got talked about as being an attention seeker, and generally not believed. It scared me out of being out at the time and has stuck with me honestly. It’s made me pretty afraid of being out as genderfluid, and I’m trying to fight the idea that no one will ever believe me but it’s hard. 

I really want to tell my partner, I want to be able to say if I want to change my pronouns, I don’t want to hide it from them. I have mentioned it to them before, that I’m not content being female and feel like I’m shifting into a different gender, they just seem to go very quiet. I don’t know if I’m reading to much into it. Every time i mention binding or wearing men’s clothing they are supportive, but quickly change the subject. If I mention cutting my hair short they try to persuade me to not do it, saying iv spent ages growing it out and I might regret it (I have just grown out my short hair after going through a long girl mood). I don’t know if they are just trying to not push me in any direction, and let me make up my own mind and come out at my own pace? But the way they seem to go quite quiet, and don’t really engage, idk it just feels odd. Like they desperately don’t want to talk about it with me. 

I’m split. I’m really worried that they aren’t going to believe me, that they aren’t convinced I know what I feel, that they will think I’m actually just cis and getting confused. They are Bisexual with a very strong female lean, so I know that they wouldn’t not be attracted to me as male, but I’m worried they are settled on the idea of me as their girlfriend and don’t want to give that up? That the want to have a girlfriend and they are going to be disappointed if I’m not that. On the contrary they are non binary, and have lots of genderqueer friends who all present really differently (some are really high fem, some are really masc, and others are very androgynous) and are very supportive and accepting of all different types of gender variance among them. I guess their reaction to me trying to talk about being genderfluid has worried me and I’m try to work out if me coming out is going to be an issue ..

2020-01-23 22:20:29,et0it1,2,1,"I will apologise now as I will probably ramble quite badly.

Anyway, I don't really know what i want to say here, or what I am hoping to get from this post, but I feel like I need to let this out and I, for multiple reasons, can't seem get myself to talk to any of my friends about this.

The basic gist is that I don't really know how I identify, I think possibly gender fluid but I'm not sure, and also I feel like I want to tell my friends but I am afraid to, and also don't know how. Also I should say i am AMAB.

I guess I will go through my gender identity history to see if it can help anyone, and myself, work out what I am. When I was very young I would sneak out of bed at night into the spare room, in this spare room was a box which had in it a purple velveteen skirt and cardigan, and I would put on the skirt. Most nights that I did this, I would sneak in grab the skirt and take it back to my room, where I would wear it for a while before putting it back. One night I took it back to my room and ended up falling asleep in it, when my mother woke me up in the morning she saw me wearing it, and I felt such shame and fear, the first thing I did when she asked about it was I begged her not to tell my sister about it. This is my earliest memory I have (at least as far as I am aware) of wanting to dress in feminine clothing. As far as I can remember I didn't touch any feminine stuff for a while after that, but as I grew older I eventually started getting the desires again, and I started occasionally sneaking into my sister's room to try on her clothes. At some point I started looking online at different things, some of the stuff I remember looking at were crossdressing and tgtf animations and drawings, I also starting watching mtf hypno videos on youtube, at some point I started masturbating to this stuff, and crossdressing and tgtf became a sexual thing for me. And for quite a while it was just a sexual guilty pleasure.

When I was around age 8/9 for some reason (I don't remember why) I decided to grow my hair out, at around age 12 I got it cut, so I could have the same style hair as all the other boys, luckily for me the hairdresser did an awful job cutting my hair and it looked awful, so I decided to grow my hair out again, and I haven't had short hair since, and I love my hair now. Anyway as my hair got longer the were many times where I get mistaken for a girl, and I remember feeling shame and anger and sometimes getting overly aggressive about it, this was clearly because of the shame and fear that I felt about what I was doing in private and people finding out about it. Every time someone mistook me for a girl or said or did anything that would have me say or do anything remotely ""feminine"" and I would get incredibly defensive because I was afraid they would discover the truth about me from it.

Anyway around age 14-16 I had a massive identity crisis, where I realised that my entire personality was fake, and that I changed almost every aspect of my personality and behaviour to fit in with my surroundings, and after realising this I started looking at myself and had no idea who the real me was, I didn't know where the lies stopped and the truth began. This was also when I slightly started to become aware (though not truly realise) that I wasn't happy, and that I was pretending to be happy, and I would hide my emotions. Well during this identity crisis I also started to question my gender, but I didn't really know what to do about it. I was afraid to talk to my family as I felt they would mock me, and I was worried my friends would leave me and mock me, so I kept it to myself. I eventually confided in this girl, who I had been getting closer too, who I thought was a friend, though years later I found out she told all me friends everything I told her, and that explained why they started to distance themselves from me.

Around age 17-18 I became friends with this girl who was much more accepting about this sort of stuff, and we ended up getting really close quite quickly. And so I confided in her and she tried to help me out, she gave me some makeup at one point, and showed me how to use it. It was through talking with her and trying to work out who I was and how I felt, that I first discovered genderfluidity and it seemed like the closest thing to how I felt, though she was quite dismissive of me saying I was genderfluid as she thought labels were unnecessary, but for me I needed a label, not for others but for myself, to help me further understand myself.

Just as I started to try and discover myself and work out how I felt, I ended up going to university. While at university, I was a bit too stressed about university and living by myself for the first time to focus on trying to understand my gender, thought I did start buying some feminine clothes, it mostly became more of a sexual thing, and after a while I started thinking that maybe for me it was just a kink. This I think has caused me more issues, as I started to tell myself that it is just a sexual thing and so I was even more ashamed to talk to people about it, because I felt lesser, this wasn't who I was this was just some kink for me. I don't think it is just some kink, and I think if anything I used it for sexual pleasure as it was the only way I would allow myself to wear feminine clothes and feel more feminine, maybe I was afraid of being non-binary and so I tried to trick myself into thinking it was just a sexual thing, or maybe it was some other reason.

While at uni I thought about my gender identity less, but slowly started to feel more confident in myself (though still very much lacking in self confidence). But in the second half of my first year I started analysing different parts of my life, one thing I noticed was how I was depressed and clearly had been for years, how my emotions were somewhat broken, as I didn't really feel emotions and mostly just felt nothing or at most content, I also realised that I hadn't cried in quite a few years. Anyway I'm getting off topic, with my discovery of my depression, I decided to do something about it and started seeing a counsellor at the uni, and for the first time in about a year I spoke to someone about all the things I was keeping to myself, and it felt quite freeing to speak about it.

Over the years I have learned more about my depression and tried to understand myself more, to debatable success. During my third year at uni I made some friends with some amazing people, and they were people from the area and not uni. These friends have helped me grow in so many ways. But one of the aspects of personal growth is that all my problems and inner concerns start to reappear and one of them is my gender identity confusion. Now I have noticed that my gender can be a big trigger for my depression, sometimes just me not really knowing who I am or how I identify, sometimes it's the fact that I can't seem to be open with my friends about it, and sometimes it's gender dysphoria.

I think I probably am genderfluid, but I don't know for certain, and I think that uncertainty is what causes me a lot of problems, and possibly one of the reasons why I can't seem to talk to my friends about it, I think I'm worried that I am wrong and will come out to them, to only find out it wasn't true. I think I also think that people will think I am just saying it for attention or something like that. I also think I am afraid my friends won't accept me and I will lose them, which is silly because we have lots of non-binary friends, and they are really accepting people, but I guess my fear of loneliness is too strong.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry that I did end up rambling, I just really don't know what to do, and sometimes it gets really hard, and I don't know how to handle my emotions (partially because I don't understand them) but writing this has helped a bit I think. A guess I just wanted to ask some people with some knowledge in the matter, whether or not it seems like I might be genderfluid, and whether I should talk to my friends about this and how to do so?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Also there are times where I feel like I am maybe feeling more female and I do at times feel really bad dysphoria, and I have though about it and I don't really know how to remedy it, as I said earlier I have been growing my hair out since I was about 12 (I am currently 22) my hair is long, almost at my belly button, but I also have a full beard. Now I am fine with my hair at all times, it doesn't matter how I feel, I am always comfortable with my hair, however when I feel my female I don't necessarily want the beard, but I do want the beard when I feel male (which is most of the time) and I am worried about how long it takes to grow it out, also the last time I shaved my beard off I really hated how I looked without it. But also I ended up feeling dysphoria with other aspects of my body and I don't really know how to deal with any of it, since me feeling female is less frequent than feeling male.

It was through talking with her and trying to work out who I was and how I felt, that I first discovered genderfluidity and it seemed like the closest thing to how I felt, though she was quite dismissive of me saying I was genderfluid as she thought labels were unnecessary, but for me I needed a label, not for others but for myself, to help me further understand myself.\n\nJust as I started to try and discover myself and work out how I felt, I ended up going to university. While at university, I was a bit too stressed about university and living by myself for the first time to focus on trying to understand my gender, thought I did start buying some feminine clothes, it mostly became more of a sexual thing, and after a while I started thinking that maybe for me it was just a kink. This I think has caused me more issues, as I started to tell myself that it is just a sexual thing and so I was even more ashamed to talk to people about it, because I felt lesser, this wasn\'t who I was this was just some kink for me. I don\'t think it is just some kink, and I think if anything I used it for sexual pleasure as it was the only way I would allow myself to wear feminine clothes and feel more feminine, maybe I was afraid of being non-binary and so I tried to trick myself into thinking it was just a sexual thing, or maybe it was some other reason.\n\nWhile at uni I thought about my gender identity less, but slowly started to feel more confident in myself (though still very much lacking in self confidence). But in the second half of my first year I started analysing different parts of my life, one thing I noticed was how I was depressed and clearly had been for years, how my emotions were somewhat broken, as I didn\'t really feel emotions and mostly just felt nothing or at most content, I also realised that I hadn\'t cried in quite a few years. Anyway I\'m getting off topic, with my discovery of my depression, I decided to do something about it and started seeing a counsellor at the uni, and for the first time in about a year I spoke to someone about all the things I was keeping to myself, and it felt quite freeing to speak about it.\n\nOver the years I have learned more about my depression and tried to understand myself more, to debatable success. During my third year at uni I made some friends with some amazing people, and they were people from the area and not uni. These friends have helped me grow in so many ways. But one of the aspects of personal growth is that all my problems and inner concerns start to reappear and one of them is my gender identity confusion. Now I have noticed that my gender can be a big trigger for my depression, sometimes just me not really knowing who I am or how I identify, sometimes it\'s the fact that I can\'t seem to be open with my friends about it, and sometimes it\'s gender dysphoria.\n\nI think I probably am genderfluid, but I don\'t know for certain, and I think that uncertainty is what causes me a lot of problems, and possibly one of the reasons why I can\'t seem to talk to my friends about it, I think I\'m worried that I am wrong and will come out to them, to only find out it wasn\'t true. I think I also think that people will think I am just saying it for attention or something like that. I also think I am afraid my friends won\'t accept me and I will lose them, which is silly because we have lots of non-binary friends, and they are really accepting people, but I guess my fear of loneliness is too strong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry that I did end up rambling, I just really don\'t know what to do, and sometimes it gets really hard, and I don\'t know how to handle my emotions (partially because I don\'t understand them) but writing this has helped a bit I think. A guess I just wanted to ask some people with some knowledge in the matter, whether or not it seems like I might be genderfluid, and whether I should talk to my friends about this and how to do so?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso there are times where I feel like I am maybe feeling more female and I do at times feel really bad dysphoria, and I have though about it and I don\'t really know how to remedy it, as I said earlier I have been growing my hair out since I was about 12 (I am currently 22) my hair is long, almost at my belly button, but I also have a full beard. Now I am fine with my hair at all times, it doesn\'t matter how I feel, I am always comfortable with my hair, however when I feel my female I don\'t necessarily want the beard, but I do want the beard when I feel male (which is most of the time) and I am worried about how long it takes to grow it out, also the last time I shaved my beard off I really hated how I looked without it. But also I ended up feeling dysphoria with other aspects of my body and I don\'t really know how to deal with any of it, since me feeling female is less frequent than feeling male. Sorry again for the rambling, I just really need to let this out while I think about it and feel strongly enough that I can get myself to post this.', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'Struggling with myself and my gender', 'created': 1579843229.0}"

I've been having an issue trying to get started with makeup and wanted to make a post here to see if anyone here might be able and willing to offer some insight.

I want to start doing makeup and am having a hard time figuring out where to start. I've looked up makeup tutorials for beginners and so far it feels like many of them are written by people who've been doing makeup for a long time and take for granted that people have certain tools and knowledge already. I end up feeling bombarded by unfamiliar terminology that is never properly explained and get frustrated, which has thus far halted my attempts to try makeup before they ever really started.

There are really two questions that I have that I wanted to toss out to people here:

1. What things should I absolutely make certain to have on hand before trying to apply makeup for the first time?
2. Does anyone have recommendations for a really good tutorial for someone that has effectively zero working knowledge of cosmetics? 

Any help, insight, or advice that people can offer is greatly appreciated!

I just don't know what I am anymore. Am I a still a man? Am I transgender? Genderfluid? What does this mean for my marriage. She married a straight male not someone gender queer.

2020-01-31 01:12:01,ewg554,1,1,"Hi! New member here. I thought my first post on this subreddit would be about my experience with genderfluidity. So... here goes nothing.

  
I have identified as genderfluid since my freshman year of high school. Mainly, in the beginning, I stuck to the end of the spectrum where I identified with my birth gender (female) but found out later on that I was fluctuating fluently between female, non-binary, and male. I was rarely ever feeling like both, and if I did feel like both, the feeling would disappear within an hour or so. Passing for the gender I felt like when I woke up, however, was and continues to be a struggle as I am four years in the closet. I can't buy new clothes from other sections outside of the ""female"" section so I'm kind of stuck at the moment.

  
I have many friends that have come out to me as genderfluid before I came out to them so that, along with experimenting with my gender expression and identity, it made it easier to realize I'm genderfluid. However, since coming out, I have had a lot of backlashes (mainly transphobes telling me I have to pick one gender and can't be multiple) and this caused me to push myself further into the closet. However, things have gotten much better since then! I am out to all of my friends and they accept and support me 1000%. I went from completely repressed to getting better and improving.  

  
You may be asking, why am I posting this? This post is mainly for young genderfluid individuals to find and read so they know that things get better. If you are struggling with not being able to express yourself on days you are outside of your birth gender and being in the closet, I promise you, one day you will be able to do all of that. Just wait and see. It takes time, but eventually, you'll be free.
