I don’t really know how to go about writing this at all, so I’m just gonna go ahead and try to write something and see how that goes? (Also, I really hope that none of this is offensive or bad; I’m really nervous about messing up my first attempt to talk here).

To start, I’m really conflicted. At this point in my journey, I’m pretty sure that I’m genderfluid (or enbie). 

However, most of my life, I have avoided ANYTHING that had any mention of gender fluidity. It always made me feel so...angry. I realize now that anger  likely came from me suppressing my own feelings. Anyway, as a result, now that I’ve finally admitted to myself that my gender isn’t as binary as I always “thought” (or, really if I’m being honest, wanted), I’ve been looking for places where I can talk to other people like me. I have a lot of LGBTQ+ friends and role models in my life, and I’m eternally grateful to them, but I’ve never talked to anyone....like me. And I have no idea where to start- I feel so behind about all of this; almost like a bull in a china shop? Even though I’ve tried to read more about it, I still feel so lost when it comes to learning about and engaging in this community that I think I might be a part of.

Shattered on the inside
Regretting decisions from long ago
And trying to remember something joyous
No matter how long she tries
She cannot do so
A past of pain
Loss
Regret
And fear
Not the right way to grow up
Not the right way to go out
She tries to find comfort in friends 
That at this point are in bed
Music is already playing and having no impact
She tries her favorite game to no avail
She decides it’s late enough to try and sleep
She looks at herself in the mirror
Contemplating life and remembering friends
Hoping that today will be better
She studies her own body
And sees the one thing that she is trying so hard to change
He forgets everything
And he falls asleep
Waiting for the day

2020-05-04 03:40:58,gd4986,3,1,"Here are my “signs” of being trans,


For trans :

- Have bad depression, maybe related to gender dysphoria?

- On the ""am I trans part 2"" YouTube video I identified w/ 5 of the 7 ""signs"" of gender dysphoria

- I've crossdressed when I've had the chance since I was 17 (now 22).

- at age 14 I found that the phrase ""lesbian in a male body"" (or male lesbian) and the term ""autogynephilia"" and its ""symptoms"" really applied to me. It seemed like I had something that described my confusion for once. 

- age 14-16, would pray to wake up a girl every night (probably would have fit the diagnosis for gender dysphoria at the time), pray for brain transplant machine, want aliens to abduct me and change me to girl, wishing I was put in witness protection so I could get a sex change disguise and was curious about reincarnation

- always having had sexual fantasies as a girl

- took informal online gender tests and got ""female"" a majority of the time, generally excited when I did and disappointed when I didn't 

- fascination by gender bending themes in cartoons (code name kids next door, jimmy neutron, fairly odd parents, etc.), movies (scooby doo, freaky Friday, etc) and online captions

- sometimes choosing female avatars, including female names on some email accounts

- Seeing attractive girls, wanting to be w/ them and imagining being them at same time.

- Maybe felt some jealousy of women, confusing combination of emotions (clocked a transgirl at an airport and felt a mixed bag of emotions including what seemed like attraction, jealousy and others) 

- had lots of dreams in past few years as female, feeling very happy in them, hoping to go back asleep to continue them. Also tried lucid dreaming to try to be female in them.

- feel something missing in chest area at times. It can get annoying, especially when trying to sleep, and I would often use a pillow/blanket to ""fill the missing area"". Not sure if gender related though..  (could it be body dysphoria?)



Against Trans:

- not really having dysphoria, as in hating my body or being male (from what I can tell)
Feeling generally neutral w/ it though (due to it being objectively fit/good) feeling proud of it at times and enjoying looking good at times..

The thing is, last year we dated for 3 months (ended up as friends), but now she asked me if I would have dated her (or liked her) if she were genderfluid back then.

She told me that, while she understood me, she didn't like the idea that just because she isn't female, I wouldn't like her anymore.

After a lot of crying on her part and talking some more, we ended the call, but now I'm kind of freaking out, thinking that I fucked up. I really want to support her, but all of this is pretty new to me and I don't know a lot about it.

2020-05-04 20:56:21,gdjzdn,2,1,"Hello everyone, I'm AFAB. 16 year old.. bisexual.

i've been questioning my gender identity, i don't know if i'm cisgender or genderfluid. I'm afraid to call myself ""genderfluid"" because I'm not sure and I might be just questioning/overthinking. I don't wanna offend people/appropriate identities.

So, when I was about 11/12 I was a big fan of guys, most of my idols were in rock bands and most of them were guys, I wanted to be like them because they were very confident, could do whatever they wanted to do, express themselves sexually without being judged, y'know. A woman can't do any of this, because she ""has to be polite""

Usually, when I become a fan of someone, I'm highly influenced by this person, personality, style, etc. And I was 12 so it was reasonable, I was experimenting different things.. I became very influenced by this ""rockstar"" attitude, I felt really confident when I listened to the songs, and I felt basically like a ""male"" (confident (?)) I don't know. 

I liked wearing masculine clothes, it felt good, this may be a gender non-conforming trait. However, I also liked wearing feminine clothes/makeup. I always loved my body, my name. I didn't even think about pronouns, I didn't even notice people were calling me she, because I just didn't bother/care, to be called with masculine/neutral pronouns would be weird.

I had this sort of tomboyish attitude, but one thing got me: sometimes I don't know if I'm attracted to male's bodies, or if i'm jealous of their bodies. It also happens with females, I love Marilyn Monroe's hourglass shape, and I even bought a corset because I wanted my body to look more like her body.

However, sometimes I get myself looking at some of my idol's men body, like, T shape, and I'm attracted/jealous of it, jealous of the shape... I don't know if it counts as gender dysphoria, that's exactly why I need help. I know that fans sometimes ""imitate"" their idols, but I don't know if ""wanting"" to be them and dress like them (regardless if they're male of female"") is something a cisgender person would do. maybe i'm just highly influenceable, but i'm confused

I've noticed it only happens when I have a strong obsession for people I'm a fan of, like, if a man who isn't someone I'm a fan of walked in front of me, I wouldn't have this ""desire"" to have his body...

Now, onto the topic. Before I actually realised I was genderfluid and was just convinced I was a female, thinking I was trans, I actually had some sort of dysphoria. I hated absolutely everything about my appearance, reflective surfaces made me nauseous at the mere concept of myself, and I experienced euphoria at feminine pronouns, the mere concept of wearing feminine clothing and the act of it itself when I got around to it. That I believe, with the fact that I disliked mg genitals and wished to be rid of them (euphoria also at the thought), led me to believe that I had mild dysphoria at the time. I wasn't really interacting with trans people or browsing subs like r/egg_irl then, and thus I believe my experiences weren't shaped heavily by my idea of how they were meant to be. After some time passed and my gender changed inexplicably I eventually realised I was genderfluid and suddenly did not really have any dysphoric symptoms. I did a lot of browsing around about it to learn more at that time because I was, as you can imagine, very very confused, and I saw that some genderfluid people didn't experience dysphoria almost at all.

That I believe was the turning point for me, when I tried to analyse how I felt and with that knowledge I concluded I did not have dysphoria. After that, these days, I do experience very very minor symptoms linked to dysphoria, like a want for different genitalia (but not a dislike of my current), a very potent dislike of my body when I'm a female, but not something stopping me from looking at myself, and absolutely no euphoria other than a really strong urge to be feminine as a girl.

Now, that should be great. I should be ecstatic that I'm free of such a terrible thing to have. I'm sure I don't need to explain why dysphoria can ruin someone's enjoyment of life, productivity etc., but, I.. still really wished I could be dysphoric again. For multiple reasons.

One is the self hatred I possess that makes me feel like I should be punished, and ruined. Torn apart. It's obviously irrational but it still exists and I want dysphoria for that reason also, to increase how much suffering I go through.

Another is a part of a philosophy I've always strongly believed in that is that, under natural circumstances and accounting only for things in your control, you can only feel as happy as you were sad, you can only feel as rested as you did tired, and you can only feel as content with your gender and appearance as you did feel dysphoric. Notice how I said feel, and not be. That's because you quite obviously can be happier than you did sad beforehand, but without the comparison to the negativity you can't quite appreciate it and feel it as strongly as you would otherwise. This is a terrible philosophy to live by, and is only going to end up with a lot of people being hurt, I try to avoid it myself actively, but here I go by it still because that's simply what I want to do to support my argument. (I forgot the original  reasons I made for this, that I did about 14 hours ago and were separated by involuntary sleep, so I'm using what I can think up now that my mind isn't crazy on sleep deprivation.)

One more reason is that I simply want to feel valid with who I am. I see other people going through so *so* much worse things while trying to transition and I just feel like a cheat for getting through this so.. easily. I know I shouldn't feel this way, I really do, but I want to feel more valid. I want to have something to show for, to say that I suffered and got where I am today. I just feel personally, like I'm no more than a glorified crossdresser. I'd love to be proud of my gender identity, because obviously that's a positive emotion to have with something like that, but I just feel so wrong and.. I don't feel I should be wanted by others if I am to identify with a group of people that suffer hundreds and hundreds of times more while I just.... don't. The only suffering I really go through is the pressure from being incapable of dressing the way I feel most comfortable, which is minor, the feeling of not deserving my gender identity, and some suicidal thoughts (and SH triggers) which come from seemingly nowhere but relate to my gender...

I.. feel spoiled for wanting such a terrible thing. I feel wrong also, but something in me just keeps pushing me and making me want this quite terrible fate. I don't know how I'll react if my wish is somehow granted, perhaps I'll react with regret, but at least I'll have a reason to feel as I do with my gender, and I'll be able to justify being how I am. Screaming out into the world about my mental state and problematic behaviour, that's going to be justified if I can just.. have dysphoria or something like it to do with my gender, so that I can truly experience the suffering I deserve and the suffering that would validate me objectively. People saying I'm valid, even myself saying I'm valid, is far from enough to prove that what I'm going through is real, and all things considered, when I first understood I had become a girl, I enjoyed seeing how terrible of a state I was in. It's.. motivating, knowing how much I'll be able to improve and build upon myself, and my incessant daydreaming will have actual worth, instead of being just my impossible desires. It'll be me thinking of the future. Thinking about how great it'll be when I achieve what I want to, even if it might take years to do so, the constant crushing anxiety would.. help.

To be perfectly honest, this matter here causes a lot of anxiety in me. Unfounded anxiety, since I'm basically begging for something I'll... never be able to get, which now that I'm writing it actually makes me quite emotional.........  I don't know why I'm putting this out there, I don't know what I'm hoping to achieve, but in the end I can say I got it off of my chest and to a community I trust, after lurking it and posting another vent, iirc.

2020-05-06 15:05:06,gelphe,6,1,"So my boyfriend (cis/straight) has known longer than I have that I’m genderfluid (22, afab). We’ve been together for 3 years and when we started dating I presented only as fem, knew I was bi, but never questioned my gender. About a year ago I started feeling some gender dysphoria, we moved in together about 9 months ago, I came out as non binary about 6 months ago, and find non binary and they/them pronouns as sort of nice umbrella terms to define myself. The past few weeks I’ve had horrible gender dysphoria that I’ve never experienced before, not being able to have any sort of sexual relations, not wanting to have boobs, not wanting to see myself naked, not wanting to wear any of my fem clothes (which is pretty much all I have). I told him how I’m feeling and he’s so supportive. But he keeps bringing up wanting to get engaged and feels pressure from his fam (who somehow don’t know I’m queer and are super queerphobic) to buy me a ring which feels kinda shitty. 

BUT I also know he is super cis and super straight (which is totally cool). I’m starting to wonder if I was with a queer person, would it be easier to express my gender etc? He supports me when I present more masc, but I’m kinda scared to do more like buy a binder, cut my hair shorter, etc and what his reaction would really be because he again is 100% straight. Don’t get me wrong I love him a lot, emotionally and do find him attractive, but I can’t help but imagine myself being a top, not having boobs, getting a strap on, shaving my head, and dumping most of my fem wardrobe. 

I think genderfluid/nb fit me and I don’t think I’m a trans man, but I’m worried about staying with him and realizing in the future I don’t like men (he’s the only man I really like) or that maybe I’m more masc than I thought.

Advice needed. I’m not sure if I’m agender or genderfluid or just a girl.

Hi! I need advice. I am a bisexual teenager, and I’m still questioning my gender. My friend says I am genderfluid between agender and female. But, I don’t know.

I’m fine with female things, though, they aren’t really appealing to me anymore. I hate wearing skirts and dresses or stockings! I’d trade it off with slacks or pants and a blouse, though my mom would never let me. I rather masculine clothes, but, my mother would also never let me get masculine clothing. 

I see myself as a person more than classified as a gender. Though, sometimes I like the occasional crop top. I rather the pronouns they/them because I am uncomfortable with she/her. I think I have experienced dysphoria in the past, I hated my woman body and wanted to change it, but now I am fine with it. Just wish I was a little flatter. I don’t like being labeled a woman, I just don’t feel like one at all..

Sometimes I feel like a female, othertimes just a person who doesn’t need labels. I rather gender neutral colours and clothing and would like to change my name..I think my mom is homophobic, though. I do not know if I could ever come out to her.

for starters, I'm afab, And already this is where things get complicated.
 I've noticed for a while that irl my tastes and feelings lean more towards the masculine/androgynous side, not to mention my feelings towards being identified as a woman and how I've never felt represented as such.

But, I feel that if I were more masculine/not feminine, I would feel much more comfortable wearing feminine clothes? Like, I would totally wear more dresses and skirts and thigh highs if I were masc presenting.

It's the same in video games, I *always* choose the male character and I *always* give him feminine attire. Doing the opposite doesn't give me the same feeling as the other, I've also never liked playing as my irl self in games, it makes me uncomfortable.

But on another note, I think if I were married I would be more comfortable being called ""Wife"" but I'm not comfortable with people other than my future SO calling me feminine terms/pronouns. Maybe this has to do something with my Social dysphoria? Idk.

When I first started my transition, I wanted a place where I could go to feel less demoralized. A place where I could see what kind of changes I could expect and a safe place to share my own timeline when I started having the results I was looking for. As far as I am aware there is no place like this, so I wanted to create it and invite members and hopefully the word spreads and we can get a nice series of threads going.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a scary time for a lot of us, and we need more safe places where we can share progress, tips, regimens and even fitness tips for sculpting, curving and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

I want it to be friendly to all participants, in whichever way you are heading during your transition, and I am also looking for moderators so if you are interested in helping out that would be lovely.

&amp;#x200B;

It is meant to be a safe space for people who are going through transition. A place where we can share and grow, and bring our best selves forward.

&amp;#x200B;

Please don't hesitate to get in touch and send a PM if you are interested, I will be posting in some popular threads this message, as well as trying to drum up some support so we can get the ball rolling! I should mention that it is a NSFW subreddit but please don't feel like you have to be NSFW to have a say or a post here. It's a place for everyone of any comfort level.

&amp;#x200B;

About six months ago I posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/genderfluid/comments/dsko5o/an_exploration_of_nonbinary_individuals/) (mod approved) to recruit participants for an online survey, diary keeping, and interview. There was a brilliant response, however I am now in need of further diary keeping/interview participants.

If any non-binary individuals here would be interested in keeping a journal re: their experiences with their body for a period of two to four weeks, followed by an asynchronous email interview please contact me at [Jessica6.Taylor@live.uwe.ac.uk](mailto:Jessica6.Taylor@live.uwe.ac.uk). I’m looking to recruit around ten participants.

Here are my “signs” of being trans,


For trans :

- Relate to most of the MTF egg memes/bingos

- Relate to most of the experiences of trans women on here

- Have bad depression, maybe related to gender dysphoria?

- On the ""am I trans part 2"" YouTube video I identified w/ 5 of the 7 ""signs"" of gender dysphoria

- I've crossdressed when I've had the chance since I was 17 (now 24).

- at age 14 I found that the phrase ""lesbian in a male body"" (or male lesbian) and the term ""autogynephilia"" and its ""symptoms"" really applied to me. It seemed like I had something that described my confusion for once. 

- age 14-16, would pray to wake up a girl every night (probably would have fit the diagnosis for gender dysphoria at the time), pray for brain transplant machine, want aliens to abduct me and change me to girl, wishing I was put in witness protection so I could get a sex change disguise and was curious about reincarnation

- always having had sexual fantasies as a girl

- took informal online gender tests and got ""female"" a majority of the time, generally excited when I did and disappointed when I didn't 

- fascination by gender bending themes in cartoons (code name kids next door, jimmy neutron, fairly odd parents, etc.), movies (scooby doo, freaky Friday, etc) and online captions

- sometimes choosing female avatars, including female names on some email accounts

- Seeing attractive girls, wanting to be w/ them and imagining being them at same time.

- Maybe felt some jealousy of women, confusing combination of emotions (clocked a transgirl at an airport and felt a mixed bag of emotions including what seemed like attraction, jealousy and others) 

- had lots of dreams in past few years as female, feeling very happy in them, hoping to go back asleep to continue them. Also tried lucid dreaming to try to be female in them.

- feel something missing in chest area at times. It can get annoying, especially when trying to sleep, and I would often use a pillow/blanket to ""fill the missing area"". Not sure if gender related though..  (could it be body dysphoria?)

- Doing tons of things that seem to point to wanting to be trans. I get disappointed if I think I’m cis and a warm fuzzy feeling when I think of being trans. I’ve identified as Genderfluid for awhile but i don’t feel satisfied with it.


Against Trans:

- not really having dysphoria (though I hate my jaw, would rather not have body hair, and might have chest dysphoria). I don’t hate my body or being male (from what I can tell)
Feeling generally neutral w/ it though (due to it being objectively fit/good) feeling proud of it at times and enjoying looking good at times.

For example, if you prefer to date one gender, say females, but some days you identify as male and some days you identify as female, are you automatically bi or pansexual?

Here are my “signs” of being trans,


For trans :

- Relate to most of the MTF egg memes/bingos

- Relate to most of the experiences of trans women on here

- Have bad depression, maybe related to gender dysphoria?

- On the ""am I trans part 2"" YouTube video I identified w/ 5 of the 7 ""signs"" of gender dysphoria

- I've crossdressed when I've had the chance since I was 17 (now 24).

- at age 14 I found that the phrase ""lesbian in a male body"" (or male lesbian) and the term ""autogynephilia"" and its ""symptoms"" really applied to me. It seemed like I had something that described my confusion for once. 

- age 14-16, would pray to wake up a girl every night (probably would have fit the diagnosis for gender dysphoria at the time), pray for brain transplant machine, want aliens to abduct me and change me to girl, wishing I was put in witness protection so I could get a sex change disguise and was curious about reincarnation

- always having had sexual fantasies as a girl

- took informal online gender tests and got ""female"" a majority of the time, generally excited when I did and disappointed when I didn't 

- fascination by gender bending themes in cartoons (code name kids next door, jimmy neutron, fairly odd parents, etc.), movies (scooby doo, freaky Friday, etc) and online captions

- sometimes choosing female avatars, including female names on some email accounts

- Seeing attractive girls, wanting to be w/ them and imagining being them at same time.

- Maybe felt some jealousy of women, confusing combination of emotions (clocked a transgirl at an airport and felt a mixed bag of emotions including what seemed like attraction, jealousy and others) 

- had lots of dreams in past few years as female, feeling very happy in them, hoping to go back asleep to continue them. Also tried lucid dreaming to try to be female in them.

- feel something missing in chest area at times. It can get annoying, especially when trying to sleep, and I would often use a pillow/blanket to ""fill the missing area"". Not sure if gender related though..  (could it be body dysphoria?)

- Doing tons of things that seem to point to wanting to be trans. I get disappointed if I think I’m cis and a warm fuzzy feeling when I think of being trans. I’ve identified as Genderfluid for awhile but i don’t feel satisfied with it.


Against Trans:

- not really having dysphoria (though I hate my jaw, would rather not have body hair, and might have chest dysphoria). I don’t hate my body or being male (from what I can tell)
Feeling generally neutral w/ it though (due to it being objectively fit/good) feeling proud of it at times and enjoying looking good at times.

Edit: 

I realize a lot of what I say is/sounds ignorant. I very much am ignorant and do not mean to offend anyone. I’m still learning and figuring everything out. I’m just very confused at the moment and would like some help. 


So, when the whole non-binary/genderfluid thing became super popular in 2016 I think, I didn’t think much of it. I didn’t really believe in it, as I didn’t think a person could be neither gender or any gender (as far as my understanding of it goes). I still respect people’s pronouns and choices, as I’m bisexual myself, but honestly, I didn’t think anything of it.

At 20, I’m honestly starting to feel a bit confused about my gender and identity. Since I was a kid, I remember being interested in “feminine” things such as stuffed animals, dolls, playing house, and dressing girly/walking in my moms heels. As I grew older, I would even tuck (I know so embarrassing) from time to time and kind of give in to my more feminine side. 

But here’s the thing, I *know* I’m not trans, because I’m completely fine with my penis and my masculine presenting body/face. I don’t have any sort of gender dysphoria. But why then, do I feel... feminine sometimes? Further than that, I FEEL like a woman some days and other days, I feel like a man. I’ve even thought about doing drag to explore that other side of myself. Some days I feel neutral and end up feeling a bit androgynous. 

The days I feel like a woman, I’ll hide in my bathroom late at night, tuck, listen to some sexy music like Lana Del Rey, and just dance and pretend I’m an actual girl. I’ll even put a shirt on my head and pretend it’s long hair. Days I feel like a man, I just present how I always present. My pronouns (He/Him) don’t bother me though, which is why I’m confused and questioning... I’d really love some advice from everyone because I’m just feeling down and stressed about everything.

And on most days i don't care,i feel like both and neither most of the time.
(The thing is that in my native language,german,there are no they them pronouns)
So here are my questions:
Does this count as being genderfluid?
Can i still identify as a lesbian?
Do I have to come out?/Can I stick with she/her since it's easier in my language?

2020-05-21 11:51:59,gnvg39,6,1,"For those of you who are doubting or still exploring themselves, I'd like to tell you a story. My Story.
So when I was 14-15, I thought I was trans, because I felt more comfortable wearing boy's clothes and most of my friends were blokes, but I never told like anyone, not even my brother, with whom I shared a room as our parents thought we were both girls at that time.
I happened to be Christian back then, and in the German Lutheran community there is something like a second christening people in 8th grade do, so you had extra religion classes from 7th grade on, and the youth in your community went on trips and camps together. As I lived in a small village, the youth group was kinda small but a few of the things were in the city 15 kilometers away. As I was one of the few people who went to the events in the city, I didn't know most people there, and I introduced myself as Leon, because that was the name I had chosen for myself.
I soon got into other groups for older people, but nobody questioned me or my gender identity ( all of the people were like 16-30, and Germany is pretty open in general). I even had the confidence to use the men's bathroom. 
But it still didn't feel right. There were times when I felt like Leon but couldn't show it because I wasn't with that group of people, but there were also times when I felt like maybe I was getting ahead of myself or just pretending to be a boy to get attention.
A few months after my second christening I sort of got out of touch with religion and couldn't pretend to be christian anymore, so I stopped seeing them, until about two years later I was in a youth theatre group (as Lenya, the name my parents chose for me), still mostly wearing boy's clothes, and one of the technicians of my old christian groups came around to be our technician as well. He greeted me as Leon, we caught up and the rest of my theatre group was really confused, but one of them asked me if I was genderfluid. 
I had never heard of that term, and a little research showed me that there were many people who sometimes felt like a boy (Leon), sometimes like neither (Lenya) and sometimes like a girl.
Now I never was uncomfortable with female pronouns and I mostly used the girl's room, but apart from in really feminine cosplay I usually don't feel like a girl. And that's ok.
I can identify as genderfluid, because I know that I don't have to constantly switch from one to the other or be extra feminine/masculine. And it's okay if you feel like that as well.
I support all of you, and I hope so do the others who maybe experience more drastic changes is their gender.
It's okay to be genderfluid and still not like wearing tight dresses, or skirts, or whatever.

And it's okay if you feel like that as well.\nI support all of you, and I hope so do the others who maybe experience more drastic changes is their gender.\nIt's okay to be genderfluid and still not like wearing tight dresses, or skirts, or whatever.\nAs long as you're happy with yourself, there is nothing wrong with you."", 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'The story of Leon/Lenya', 'created': 1590087119.0}"

2020-05-21 19:19:57,go3a2k,13,1,"Hello, everyone. Sorry for this unoriginal title, and this long text.

As I'm always questioning myself, I've thought about my sexual orientation and my gender identity quite a number of times already (I am 18, soon to be 19 btw). For the first one, even though I'm still thinking everyday, I know that I am either bi or pan. And for the second one, I've always assumed that I was a cisgender female. And even though I had felt some discomforts with my gender quite a few times in my lifetime, I was assuming that it was just because I was some kind of tomboy.

I've always been engaged in informing myself and defending the LGBTQ+ community, and recently I've been way more engaged than ever. And a few months ago, I started questioning my gender identity even more. I started thinking that maybe I'm genderfluid. And today I'm considering it more and more, and I feel lost, and even a bit scared. So I was hoping you wonderful people (I checked some posts and y'all look amazing) could help me, since you may have been through this as well.

When I was a child, I've always done some girl stuff and I had no problem with that, I was liking some of those stuff. And yet I felt like I was quite out of place : in elementary, I would always wear sports pants, I wanted to play games with the boys, I wanted to hang out with them sometimes. From when I was a child, I've always hated dresses and skirts, and this is even more accurate now. I have some skirts (which I seldom wear), but I barely have one dress in my closet. When I try on a dress (and to a lesser extent, when I trying wearing a skirt), I truly feel uncomfortable. I don't think I've ever experienced dysphoria, but maybe the feeling I have wearing a dress is getting quite close to it.
Moreover, now when I'm looking for clothes (I really like fashion), my choices are oriented towards men or gender-neutral clothes/accessories, like, 80% of the time.

It's not only about the clothes, of course. Sometimes I like to behave a bit like how boys are raised in our society : taking space, talking loudly, taking initiatives (I know it sounds very cliché, but that's kinda how patriarchy raises boys). Also, I'm tall for a girl (I'm 6'1), my hair looks quite ""androgynous"" and I have a large, yet still feminine body figure.

But at the same time, I'm sure that I still feel comfortable with the gender I was assigned at birth. I still love doing stuff that are considered to be more ""for women"" (makeup, fashion, shopping...), sometimes I like behaving how girls are taught to behave, and also I've got the incredible luck not to have genital dysphoria. Even though I've wished more than once that I had a beard, or that I had a penis, it still doesn't make me feel bad, and I have no problem going in the lady's restroom rather in the men's restroom.

There's an experience I'd like to share with y'all. A couple of months ago, I decided to go to university dressed in a way that would make me feel as manly as possible. I had only class in the afternoon, so I thought it would be the perfect day to try it (plus, I was reaaaally feeling like it, that day). And when I was done with my outfit, I felt something. I felt a joy I had never experienced before. I was just feeling so amazing and so confident. I was smiling and laughing when I was looking at myself in the mirror, and even though I still found some feminine traits in my appearance, I think I was feeling as a man.

But this experience made me realize something else, which is leading me to be scared now. During that day, people used female pronouns with me (since they're the ones that were used with me everyday). And I could not correct them. Because I didn't know if I was legitimate. Because I was scared they would laugh at me or stare at me with a perplex face. Because I feared that it would be another whim of mine.

And at the end of the day, I am lost. Am I just a tomboy ? Am I legitimate ? Sometimes, when I look at myself in the mirror, I wonder if I'm really a woman. But another part of me tells me I am. And what if I'm really genderfluid ? How will I tell people ? Will I be able to hide it ? ""Non-binary"" is such a new concept for people, and it's already challenged from all parts, are they going to accept it ?

I don't expect any one of you to ""diagnose"" me as genderfluid or not. I would just like to know if you have ever asked yourselves the same questions that I have right now, and if you have ever felt these fears. Feel free to share your experience and to ask me questions about what I said before.

2020-05-22 15:01:07,gokxb1,0,1,"(Excuse the essay length post, TD;LR at end, but I really needed to lay out all the factors or else probably get the same advice as elsewhere. I don't like asking for advice like this but I'm at my wits end right now.)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 22 yo AFAB genderfluid person who's fairly thin with a large chest (10F in Australian bra sizes). I usually 'bind' by wearing a sports bra and layering with shirts over top when I feel the need to, but on my most male days sometimes I wish it was more. On and off I've been deliberating getting a binder for months. Money is better for me right now so now's the time to consider. But when I started looking up sizes, and brands, I ended up down a research rabbit hole and came out with more concerns than answers.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm concerned what it'd do to my breasts over time. Concerning the usual health worries, I feel like I'll be able to handle it, considering how infrequently I'd wear it (very very rough estimate: one a week) and how little I can put up with feeling like I can't breathe. My bigger worry is the reports I see of more sag over time. I already feel like an old lady with how saggy my breasts are, and on my female days it can get kinda depressing. I almost certainly won't be getting complete top surgery. I want breast reduction surgery, whether it'll actually happen, who knows. On the flip side, I don't get dysphoria nearly as bad as, say, an average ftm transman with my breasts on a male day, the benefit is more in a little alleviation and a good chunk of euphoria. So I have to weigh up the benefits to my more male self to the possible negative effects to my more female self. **If anyone has worn a binder infrequently for a long time, please please tell me your experience!**

&amp;#x200B;

If I do decide to get one, I'm confused over the best brand and type. There seems to be a lot of arguments over whether gc2b or Underworks is better. I hear a lot of praise for gc2b, that they're comfier and are better for sweat (very important! Australia gets hot and I sweat a lot. I am expecting heat while binding, yes, but I do want to minimise that). But I also hear from others they are overhyped, have inconsistent sizing, and are not as good for bustier individuals. Underworks, on the other hand, a lot of people also swear by, particularly for large chests, but also that some find them uncomfortable and sweaty. Going beyond these two main players, the pool really widens up and its overwhelming. I'm open to other suggestions though. Note that, while I'm willing to spend for quality, things stack up when you consider exchange rates and shipping prices to Australia, I'd really like to keep total orders under $100 AUD. As an extra note: tank or half binder? I see recommendations for long binders for large chests, but I also heard they ride up, and it's only gonna add to the sweat and heat issue. Extra extra note: no racerbacks. I have shoulder issues due to some scoliosis between the shoulder blades, mainly some weakness in the shoulders, racerback sports bras put pressure on bad spots and it gets quite painful.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR:

\-AFAB Genderfluid, skinnyish with big tiddy, might want a binder

\-Done heaps of research already, still confused

\-Will wear infrequently if I get it

\-Concerned about breast sagging over time, will not get top surgery, maybe might get breast reduction, need to weigh up increase in female self's dysphoria vs increase in male self's euphoria

\-Want to minimise heat and sweat issues where possible

\-Not sure on brand or half vs tank binder

\-No racerbacks

On and off I've been deliberating getting a binder for months. Money is better for me right now so now's the time to consider. But when I started looking up sizes, and brands, I ended up down a research rabbit hole and came out with more concerns than answers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm concerned what it'd do to my breasts over time. Concerning the usual health worries, I feel like I'll be able to handle it, considering how infrequently I'd wear it (very very rough estimate: one a week) and how little I can put up with feeling like I can't breathe. My bigger worry is the reports I see of more sag over time. I already feel like an old lady with how saggy my breasts are, and on my female days it can get kinda depressing. I almost certainly won't be getting complete top surgery. I want breast reduction surgery, whether it'll actually happen, who knows. On the flip side, I don't get dysphoria nearly as bad as, say, an average ftm transman with my breasts on a male day, the benefit is more in a little alleviation and a good chunk of euphoria. So I have to weigh up the benefits to my more male self to the possible negative effects to my more female self. **If anyone has worn a binder infrequently for a long time, please please tell me your experience!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I do decide to get one, I'm confused over the best brand and type. There seems to be a lot of arguments over whether gc2b or Underworks is better. I hear a lot of praise for gc2b, that they're comfier and are better for sweat (very important! Australia gets hot and I sweat a lot. I am expecting heat while binding, yes, but I do want to minimise that). But I also hear from others they are overhyped, have inconsistent sizing, and are not as good for bustier individuals. Underworks, on the other hand, a lot of people also swear by, particularly for large chests, but also that some find them uncomfortable and sweaty. Going beyond these two main players, the pool really widens up and its overwhelming. I'm open to other suggestions though. Note that, while I'm willing to spend for quality, things stack up when you consider exchange rates and shipping prices to Australia, I'd really like to keep total orders under $100 AUD. As an extra note: tank or half binder? I see recommendations for long binders for large chests, but I also heard they ride up, and it's only gonna add to the sweat and heat issue. Extra extra note: no racerbacks. I have shoulder issues due to some scoliosis between the shoulder blades, mainly some weakness in the shoulders, racerback sports bras put pressure on bad spots and it gets quite painful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR:\n\n\\-AFAB Genderfluid, skinnyish with big tiddy, might want a binder\n\n\\-Done heaps of research already, still confused\n\n\\-Will wear infrequently if I get it\n\n\\-Concerned about breast sagging over time, will not get top surgery, maybe might get breast reduction, need to weigh up increase in female self's dysphoria vs increase in male self's euphoria\n\n\\-Want to minimise heat and sweat issues where possible\n\n\\-Not sure on brand or half vs tank binder\n\n\\-No racerbacks\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdvice pls, and thanks for putting up with the long post, feel free to ask for clarifications"", 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'Genderfluid Binding Worries... help!', 'created': 1590184867.0}"

2020-05-22 21:51:02,gosmkf,4,2,"Hi!

I'm going absolutely crazy these days and I really need to hear your thoughts on what I’m experiencing. I’ve been meaning to get some therapy for a while, but my job doesn’t pay well, and it took so long to find an effective way to juggle my expenses to get a good enough healthcare plan. But as soon as I did that, Covid hit and I’m not getting paid anymore, and I won’t till July. So I don’t have access to any form of psychological help.

I’m 25, I’m AMAB, I’m pansexual, I’m in the spectrum, I’m obsessive, and I’ve been questioning my gender identity consciously for a whole year and a half now.

My main question is, is it reasonable to think I could be MtF trans, non-binary or genderfluid? Or I’m misreading things and it’s mostly a fetish?

At first I felt really guilty and bad. I felt at times an incontrollable wish to be a girl and to be seen as such. But thinking about it a lot would get me horny and thinking of what having sex as a girl would be. So I’d just decide it was a fetish or a kink. And also I wasn’t feeling what the community describes as dysphoria. And I wasn’t uncomfortable with being seen as a boy.

But with time the feeling became more and more frequent, and I find myself spending hours every day thinking of how I’d want to dress, and how I’d like to paint my nails, and what make-up would look good on me, and even getting chills when imagining people using female pronouns on me, calling me a girl name, and stuff like that. The other day I even saw a show in which I guy is read as a girl and pat in the head in a very cute way, and I almost exploded.

I started looking back at my childhood and teen years trying to figure out if there were any sort of signs of me being trans or something. At first I found nothing, but since a couple of months ago I’ve been getting a flood of memories that I hadn’t revisited in years, or that I hadn’t reinterpreted since I started questioning. I started recalling how I thought I was feminine or in in-between genders when I was just 8! Or going crazy after how some girls looked, and realizing now it wasn’t about them, but their clothes and hair. Also I suffered a lot of bullying in elementary school about how small I was (I’m still now really short and skinny) , and nowadays I can’t distinguish if my feeling bad about my body back then was more because of that bullying, or a general confusion because of how I wasn’t like the other boys. But doesn’t that mean I wanted to be a boy? What would it mean regarding my gender identity? I remember how I played almost exclusively girl characters in games, and while I thought for most of my life that I just wanted to be looking at the cute character, now I’m not so sure.

And these last months I started relating my general insecurities and difficulties socializing with the idea that may be I’m not at all confortable with what being a guy means, and that being a guy exhausts me. I’ve always been the shyest guy I know when it comes to letting others see my body, and mostly my upper body. I’ve always been super uncomfortable with “guy sense of humor”, but I thought till now that it was just because it’s an objectively disgusting humor. I’ve always loved talking about sex with my female friends, and hated doing it with the guys. I can’t have fluent long conversations with guys at all actually, not even the guys I date. But again, it’s just common sense to realize guys are disgusting. But I know there are some situations, socially, in which I can only think of myself as a guy. For instance, I’m an ecological activist in my home town, and I’m one of the main voices of our assembly against fracking, and I have to give speeches and debate people publically once every couple of months, and in those situations I take a very manly attitude, voice tone, gestures, and everything, and I leave those situations feeling crazy euphoric and happy.

So with all of this on the table I started considering it’s possible I’d live more comfortably as with a gender identity outside the binary. But I don’t know, because I’d absolutely love to identify as a girl. And even though I’m not sure I’d be comfortable with it all the time, the few times I’ve presented as such (mostly, but not only, online) or I’ve been confused with one (I use my hair really long and I have a very generic figure), it’s been the best feeling in the world.

I talked a lot with my so, but I don’t have the level of confidence I need to tackle this with them. But one thing they said that really got to me was that one isn’t built for a specific gender, and we’re not naturally male or female, or other, and that those ideas are societal notions of role, and that we can feel comfortable with one, two, many, or none of them. And that every experience is unique. That really got to me, so I’m trying to figure out what’s best for me here. But I also know people that don’t agree with these ideas, so I’m not sure it’s reasonable to use them as a guide when it comes to figuring out who I am.

Also, I’m terrified I’ll be ugly if I go for a female look, or that I’d look manly af. I really want to cry when I think about that. And I have some very early signs of hair loss, and I’m so scared that I could end up being a bald guy. I really don’t want that to happen, I don’t know what I’d do if I started losing my hair.

I picture being held by another girl and recognized by her as one, and being treated gently and delicately, and I just could die of how beautiful it feels. And that’s just a fantasy. Will the real thing feel like that? Will it be too awful to stand if it isn’t? But I think of going to my dad’s for dinner or something in a dress and I know I just could not do it. And it’s not that he wouldn’t understand, I scared of how it’d change the dynamics between us. Also, my little brother (17) looks up at me as his main reference when it comes to personal relations, politics, style, etc. And I feel I’d lose that it if he saw me as a girl, that it’d radically change, and my relationship with him is probably the thing that matters the most to me.

Sorry for posting such a long and freakish rant. And I know I should take it to therapy, and I will as soon as I can. But I need to bounce some ideas with somebody. I can’t really make myself talk about this with anybody I know and I’m getting desperate.",genderfluid,"I need some help figuring this out.

Hey every1! am back

Upon a bit of research I discovered other nb peeps have done what is called ""micro dosing"" and the ""DIY"" approach

And I thought ""great! maybe I don't have to go through a massive long process of waiting to be ignored about what I actually wanna transition to and can instead just get the oestrogen I need!""

And that is when I realise I actually have no idea just how much or how often or... well... anything about hormone dosages, let alone about what kind of hormone dosage is right for me.

My boundaries are to not go as far as developing breasts, but also not such a small amount that I don't change at all and testosterone continues to develop me primarily (just kinda in between)

So here I am; does anyone who is or was in a situation like this have any specific advice on hormone dosages if I were to prescribe myself them by buying them online?

To qualify, you can't be any sort of anti-LGBT. You either accept everyone or you accept no one. Biphobes, transphobes, terfs, panphobes, any sort of anti-LGBT isn't wanted. 

Your account has to have at least 1,000 karma. This is a safety net to prevent a raider from becoming a mod. 

The communities you would be helping monitor is r/LGBTart r/LGBTcrafts r/LGBTnails r/LGBTpictures r/LGBTjewelry and r/LGBTmuseum. 

Mods get limited permissions, and wrongful removal of users will get mods removed. 

The only role mods will have is to prevent hate speech and anti-LGBT rhetoric. Please leave rule breakers of minor offenses(i.e. curse words in the title, off-topic stuff, etc.) to me.

2020-05-28 14:48:09,gs7l68,6,0,"Recently, I spoke with my roommate who is also nonbinary and they mentioned ""clothing has no gender."" I think this is a loaded statement. Let me lay out my thoughts.

1. I agree, anyone can wear whatever they want.

2. Clothing sucks. And it's also awesome. Why? Because designers make fashion for twigs on the runway and until recently have historically made the fashion industry incredible hard to get into, if you are anything but a set standard. Heres looking at you, Victoria's secret. (Her secret is she is transphobic)

3. Because of the heteronormative construct, society has forced the narrative of gender onto clothing. As an AFAB myself I have suffered first hand the inconvenience of nothing but booty shorts in the shorts section, a severe lack of pockets, the dreaded brazier, and clothing stitched for the sake of, gasp, breasts and nothing else.

4. The gender construct of clothing and its use is severe in the US in particular I notice. Having been to japan, I gave a demonstration of the american no show sock for women vs. The no show sock of japan. A few scrapes of my feet had the american sock pop off like a used condom, but the japanese sock stayed on because it was sewn to conform to the contours of the foot.

The real problem is that clothing made for AFAB people DO have a set gender. Because the men that made them figured they would be taken off, anyway.

2020-05-31 07:09:39,gtugso,1,1,"When I was really young I used to wish I was a boy and I felt better dressing in baggy clothing and not being feminine but sometimes I would still feel excited to grow up and ‘be a girl’. 

In high school I cut my hair short and kept it that way for pretty much the whole time. I still dressed in baggy clothes, I would wear binders and I would generally feel uncomfortable about wearing anything too girly or revealing (that may have to do with my religious upbringing though) and I eventually began to consider myself gender fluid but masc most of the time. 

Around 2018-ish I stopped keeping my hair short and just let it grow out and now it’s well past my shoulders. I’ve definitely felt very feminine in the past couple years, wearing more revealing things, feeling more confident being feminine, etc. but rn I just feel confused.

It had been awhile since I’ve felt the desire to dress in a masculine way but more recently I’ve been upset that I don’t pass very well as a male anymore. I’ll put on my binder and some old clothes but I think it’s been so long seeing myself strictly as a female and with the long hair and everything, that it’s just hard to see myself as male anymore. I end up not really liking what I see, it feels very much unauthentic. 

I’m not sure what to do. I know that I would regret cutting my hair after spending so much time growing it, but I do miss the look of short hair. I kinda felt unstoppable in a way when I was younger but more recently I feel powerless I guess, as a woman specifically, given the type of world we live in, so I think I may just be missing that too.
