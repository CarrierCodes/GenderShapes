2020-09-01 02:30:41,ikc1a3,6,1,"Hi friends.
The title pretty much sums all up but I'm looking for some clarity. 
In 2015, I identified myself as Genderfluid and that was the time that I really felt myself. When I came out to my parents, they were very unsupportive and gave me the whole 'its just a phase' thing. I was relentlessly bullied for it too and after that year, I pretty much suppressed it all. Well it's been 5 years since then, I've been dating my boyfriend for 4 and we've never talked about it aside from me briefly mentioning it. I'm biologically a woman but have had subtle periods of feeling more masculine, way less than what I had years ago though. As I've thought more about it, I've realised I've had these periods of wanting to be masculine and realised that as I suppressed this identity, my body dysmorphia and ED had peaked at its worst. I realised this has always stuck with me even though I forced myself away from it and now I'm trying to embrace it fully. My boyfriend is cishet but he's been mega mega supportive but I can't shake the feeling that I'm just 'doing it for attention' like what these bullies said. My partner says that he has always seen it in me and it makes me feel better but I'm scared I'm not a valid enby because of the fact that I suppressed it. It's making me second guess myself. I guess what I'm looking for is some validation that I really do belong.

I want to dress in several ways, masculine, feminine or even just in between depending on the day. I have things that make me feel masculine that I enjoy for that reason, and vice versa. I feel empowered when people call me by my gender neutral screen name. Some days I hate having boobs and others I love them. When I feel masculine, I have more of an accent (Aussie), curse more (Aussie lmao) and lower my voice whereas when I feel more feminine, I raise it slightly and am a bit more pouty??? Then I have my inbetween which I can't entirely explain. There's heaps more to all this but I'd be here l day

Do I belong here? I really don't know at this point and I feel like I have so much to discover about myself but I don't know if I'm heading in the right direction.

I am a fresh non-cis-identifying person in my early 30s still trying to narrow down my actual gender identity and labels. I wanted to ask some of y'all that have been existing in your genderfluid truth for a while a couple of things, if you'd care to share.

- Do you also identify as non-binary/enby?

- Do you use neutral pronouns, multiple pronouns, or switch around between them? Are you pronoun indifferent, and if so, how has that been when interacting with friends and new people?

Genderfluid and agender seem to be the big ones that resonate most with me.

I've discovered my fluidity some time in my early 20's. Before then, I was very masculine and didn't really care that much about how I presented myself.

So I‚Äôve always known I wasn‚Äôt apart of the Binary. When I was little I accepted that I would just present female because I didn‚Äôt- and no one I knew would- understand why I sometimes felt like a boy and sometimes neither. 

I had a really traumatic childhood that‚Äôs made dealing with things like my sexuality and gender identity 20x more complicated because sometimes it‚Äôs hard to tell what‚Äôs connected to just- human experience and what‚Äôs because of trauma. 

For example a I‚Äôve always dealt with periodic feelings of overwhelming wrongness. Some of that is due to my trauma- but

Well I finally left my abusive situation and a few months went by and I finally had the capacity to have a night where my body felt wrong very obviously because of my gender and not anything else. I finally had the space and time to realize I‚Äôm gender fluid- more specifically ‚ÄúPanflux‚Äù or at least that was the best label I could find for my experience. It was the strongest swing into masculine territory I‚Äôd ever experienced and I felt so obviously like a man trapped inside a woman‚Äôs body. I didn‚Äôt so much mind having a vagina as a man (though I‚Äôve started to understand I seem to have some level of Dysphoria around sex when I‚Äôm feeling masculine- sorry it‚Äôs all new for me and laying it out like this helps me understand.) - but my breast... 

They‚Äôre huge- theyre obvious and heavy- I could never *be a man* with these things on my chest. Or at least that‚Äôs how it felt. 

Any way- today I had a little panic attack and my partner was helping my through it. I was describing what was going on and they watched me clutch at my chest while I spouted that my whole body was *just wrong.* I couldn‚Äôt place it- couldn‚Äôt understand why I was just *WRONG* 

They asked if I wanted to try binding. I- immediately was shocked and pictured myself without breasts. All of the horrible sensations washed away and I suddenly felt fine. I came out to them about a month ago and they‚Äôve also been their for me throughout dealing with my trauma. They said a lot of the time I describe this specific ‚Äúmy body feels wrong anxiety‚Äù over the last two years- I‚Äôd end up clutching my chest while I freaked out- talking about needing to escape my body. This is the first time I‚Äôve had this kind of anxiety since coming out to them... 

I hadn‚Äôt put two and two together; I had thought it was due to the abuse. But- honestly they said it and everything clicked. My breasts make me feel so *wrong.*

But it isn‚Äôt all the time- only when I‚Äôm not feeling explicitly feminine... idk

I think I might want top surgery. Even when I feel feminine I hate my breasts- they‚Äôre large and painful. When I‚Äôm feeling non-binary or masculine they actively cause me anxiety.

It was the strongest swing into masculine territory I‚Äôd ever experienced and I felt so obviously like a man trapped inside a woman‚Äôs body. I didn‚Äôt so much mind having a vagina as a man (though I‚Äôve started to understand I seem to have some level of Dysphoria around sex when I‚Äôm feeling masculine- sorry it‚Äôs all new for me and laying it out like this helps me understand.) - but my breast... \n\nThey‚Äôre huge- theyre obvious and heavy- I could never *be a man* with these things on my chest. Or at least that‚Äôs how it felt. \n\nAny way- today I had a little panic attack and my partner was helping my through it. I was describing what was going on and they watched me clutch at my chest while I spouted that my whole body was *just wrong.* I couldn‚Äôt place it- couldn‚Äôt understand why I was just *WRONG* \n\nThey asked if I wanted to try binding. I- immediately was shocked and pictured myself without breasts. All of the horrible sensations washed away and I suddenly felt fine. I came out to them about a month ago and they‚Äôve also been their for me throughout dealing with my trauma. They said a lot of the time I describe this specific ‚Äúmy body feels wrong anxiety‚Äù over the last two years- I‚Äôd end up clutching my chest while I freaked out- talking about needing to escape my body. This is the first time I‚Äôve had this kind of anxiety since coming out to them... \n\nI hadn‚Äôt put two and two together; I had thought it was due to the abuse. But- honestly they said it and everything clicked. My breasts make me feel so *wrong.*\n\nBut it isn‚Äôt all the time- only when I‚Äôm not feeling explicitly feminine... idk\n\nI think I might want top surgery. Even when I feel feminine I hate my breasts- they‚Äôre large and painful. When I‚Äôm feeling non-binary or masculine they actively cause me anxiety.  \n\nDoes anyone else experience this kind of fluctuating dysphoria as their gender fluctuates?', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'Question - I‚Äôm Just Starting to Understand I may Deal w/ Some Kind of Dysphoria- Does Anyone Else Experience Something Similar?', 'created': 1599287994.0}"

2020-09-06 11:53:28,inks8r,2,1,"I'm AFAB, and for the longest time I've always disliked presenting feminine. There were times that I wished that I were born a guy, and on the internet I do my best to present masculine. But the thing is, despite wishing I was born a guy, I don't want to transition into one. It would've been nice if I was a boy from the start, but since I was born a girl, I don't.. particularly want to transition? I'm fine with being a girl and I'm fine with people who see me irl (whether it be strangers or someone close to me) calling me she/her and such.

The thing is though, on the internet, if someone correctly guesses she/her, I get sad. I guess it's like, since they're not seeing what I look like and yet still correctly guess she/her, it makes me feel that I didn't present masculine enough online. I keep my pronouns hidden with the hopes that people would mistake me as a guy. When people online refer to me as he/him, I don't correct them. If anything, I feel giddy and happy, as if it's almost like a guilty pleasure or something. I guess what I'm trying to say is, I personally wouldn't label myself as male or put he/him in my bio, but if someone were refer to me as being male or he/him, I wouldn't correct it.

I've thought about maybe being non-binary since I'm distant from femininity, but that doesn't really feel right either. I should clarify that, with people who are close to me + acquaintances, I want them them to use she/her. For me, it would feel weird if they used he/him or they/them or called me by another name. It might be a ""worried about stigma"" thing, but again, I don't feel sad or offended by the people around me calling me female; I'm okay with identifying as female around them. The reason why I say I don't really think non-binary is the right label is also because if people on the internet were to see me as non-binary, that doesn't... really give me the same happiness I feel from being called he/him?

Like, err, recently I became acquaintances with an online friend group (no one in the group is anyone I know irl) and when introducing myself, I used he/him instead of the usual she/they or ""any pronouns"" and it felt... really nice?? Like, it felt liberating almost. I know gender =/= pronouns, but I know they would see he/him and likely view me as male or at least masculine, and the thought of that really made me happy.

Recently, I saw a cute drawing from this genderfluid person who described their different genders. One was labeled ""The Female Me"", which is how they present with their female friends. One said ""The Non-Binary Me"", which is how they present when they're at work or with their male friends. And one said ""The Bigender Me"", which is how they present when they're with someone very close. Seeing the drawing made me think of myself. When I'm with female friends, I'd be okay with presenting both as a feminine or as a masculine girl (I wouldn't mind wearing skirts, but I probably still wouldn't wear anything girly or frilly). When I'm with my family, male friends, or most anyone I have some sort of relationship with (i.e. coworkers, etc.), I want to only present as being masculine/androgynous, but while maintaining she/her (so possibly non-binary but with she/her pronouns? though, I probably wouldn't tell most people that I'm non-binary, I'd probably just be female). And when I'm with online strangers or in general how I present to the general public, I want to be called he/him (I would be okay if someone called me she/they, but I would vastly prefer he/him). This could be me presenting as bigender? Or at the very least, masculine leaning. I would be okay with people referring me as being any gender, and I would be okay with presenting both feminine and male aspects of myself (i.e. talking to some people in a girl-ish way, but in general I'd talk/act in a masculine way), I would just vastly prefer being called a guy or being called he/him.

To summarize it, I experience different things depending on who I'm with. I wouldn't call it gender dysphoria per se, but a close friend calling me she/her and an online stranger calling me she/her would elicit different emotional responses. I don‚Äôt know if a label like non-binary would fit me because even if someone were to call me male/female, I wouldn‚Äôt feel upset (and I want to be called male in some cases), which is why I‚Äôm thinking I might be bigender or genderfluid? I guess I'm asking because it seems that for a lot of genderfluid people, their gender differs based on day and not based on who they're with? So I didn't know if genderfluid was the right word, or if what I'm feeling/experiencing has a different label.

Her reaction was to scream ‚Äúno!‚Äù, leave the room, complain to our mum (who knows but doesn‚Äôt support it) and then return only to mock me, saying I‚Äôm just looking for attention - which is basically my family‚Äôs catchphrase against me at this point.

My grandma of course jumped on the bandwagon and said some other stuff but in the end it all came down to this-is-a-phase-you‚Äôll-get-over-it-so-I-won‚Äôt-indulge kind of thing.

I was raised in a very female environment and identify with a lot of that.  
I present as male but have a broader non masculine range of clothing which shows I am leaning towards non binary genders. or multiple like pan/poly gender.  
I don't want to modify my anatomy to be more female. (though I'm not very hairy anyway)  
when asked in a form to pick male or female, I pick male but dont feel comfortable in that definition, its just my sex.   


The reasons I feel uncomfortable:  
\- im not masculine or feminine (sometimes i feel I'm both)  
\- I dont ascoiate with the traditional gender roles and find them very sexist and triggering  
\- I haven't yet worn dresses, but I like the idea of wearing heals and jewlery and maybe a little makeup when I feel more comfortable in my skin later in life (im 24)  
(i dont know if all these things affect what gender i am really)  
\- I don't relate to ""masculine"" activities or bro culture. I'm super creative and prefer the arts and a bit of home improvement DIY and fashion.  
\- I am happy with male pronouns mostly, but definitely dont think I'm a ""Man"",  I would say I'm a ""guy"" or a ""person"" which also leans towards non binary terms.   


Is there any advice you could give to help me figure out what I might define myself as?

I've been thinking back to my middle/high school experience and the few years right after. I was very masculine, has a binder, wore ""boy clothes"" and picked a name that only my ex wife knew. Then I decided I wanted to grow out my hair and I started feeling fem again. Neither of these gender presentations felt/feel uncomfortable.

I know I'm not a boy. I don't experience a lot of bodily disphoria, and I think he/him pronouns would bother me... But I don't think I'm always a girl? Idk. I'm questioning myself super hard recently. I'm worried that I'm fooling myself. I'm also afraid that if I decide to land on a genderfluid identity that people won't take me seriously. I'm worried that people will see me as a cis girl who wants attention.

I identify with my assigned gender... Half the time? I wouldn't consider myself trans because I don't want to take up space that isn't meant for me. I have my pan and polyam spaces and I'm good with that. 

I don't know. I think there's a word for me, but I don't know what I'm doing.

Sorry of my question may be a bit weird but since childhood, I experienced with some fluidity... I would sometimes act like a boy, trying to pick fights for fun (not out of spite or else) at school then turn very girly...

As a teen I would sometimes feel uneasy in my body but it was just occasional... it rarely happens now and my fluidity is more about my personality. I love makeup, classy skirts etc and also love baggy pants and large band t-shirts etc. I'm very creative and enjoying crafting pretty stuff but I'm also quite skilled in plumbing electricity etc.
I identify as a cisgender woman but often feel like a man, or a mix of both...

But the weird part is... sometimes I think I experience what is called ""phantom penis"", especially when I'm very aroused. When having sex, I sometimes just wish I just could make love to my gf like any male would do and at that moment I feel as if there was a penis between my legs. And knowing its not actually there can be frustrating...
Does it happen?
Is it part of gender fluidity? I don't think I'm a transgender man...

I've got all the female characteristics right now, so I don't really get femme dysphoria at this time.

You might cry out, but don‚Äôt worry your pretty little head!
Allow me to explain, I‚Äôm not being mean


Genderfluid is like bisexuality which also is what I am, 
Except I say what gender I am! 
One day I‚Äôll be a girl and some a boy 
Some I‚Äôll be all, and some I won‚Äôt be any at all! 

There are five stripes on our amazing flag
So I‚Äôll describe to you the best that I can
Pink n‚Äô black, white and blue, and purple too! 

Pink means feminine, so call me a she
Blue means masculine, so I‚Äôm a he!
Purple for both he and she,
Black for no gender at all, 
And white means all! 

It‚Äôs not very difficult to understand
So I beg of you, please do what you can 
To call me by my correct gender and name, 
Cuz calling me Bo or even Bobo makes me feel pretty lame.

I suggest every morning following the good morning
Asking me ‚ÄúHey Bowen, what are you today?‚Äù
Just simple acts of kindness like that make me happy
But you can‚Äôt stop there!
Always call me by my correct gender and name, 
And don‚Äôt get mad when I correct you if you make a mistake.

Sorry if I sound rude, there's just so much to do 
So this is why I wrote this song for you. 
I love you both with the bottom of my heart, even when I act like a shark
I know you love me too, so please

Call me boy or girl or none or all accordingly
Follow those five words, and we will be at peace
Thank you so much for listening to this song I wrote,
And I dearly hope you understand.",genderfluid,Coming Out Song,1599857051.0,"{'created_utc': 1599831851, 'id': 'iqqqi4', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""Can someone help me edit my Coming-Out song?

I've noticed that I usually feel happier when I'm feeling male (specifically demi-boy) and feel kind of tired and disappointed when I feel like a girl.  I've had a few days of complete breakdowns feeling like I'm just a demi-boy, not genderfluid, and there are a few other things that I feel even on fem days that kind of imply that.  I don't have severe dysphoria most days (usually just my voice and chest) so judging it by that hasn't been helpful.

I grew up in an abusive home where I was constantly pressured and coerced into appearing hyper feminine all the time, so I may still have some negative associations I have to get past, and feeling like a boy might just feel better because of that, but I'm not sure.

I also know that lots of people before they realize that they're binary trans will go through a phase of identifying as nb/genderfluid/genderqueer/etc before they can be comfortable as a completely different gender, and it's been sitting in the back of my mind for awhile.

I'm not asking anyone to tell me what I am, I know I'm the only one who can figure it out, but I have some questions for other genderfluid people that I think can help point me in the right direction:

Do you have a favorite gender out of all the ones you experience?  Are there any genders you get fatigued or tired of?

Disconnected by Cowboy Mouth

Have you ever felt the thunder inside your heart?
Holding onto all the shit that's going to tear you apart
Till you done free yourself there ain't a brand new start,
So you gotta let go.

I once had a friend who lived in an Eastern town
He moved back home and called and started hangin' around,
But every time I tried to talk to him, he put me down,
So I gotta let go.

Nobody knows who you are
Nobody cares who you are
Nobody knows why you feel
Disconnected.

Maybe it's the way I'm told I oughta look and feel,
Maybe it's because my mind is so easy to steal.
Then I'm living in a world where nothing here is really real,
So I gotta let go.
How do I get the fuck out of this place?
How when I look in a mirror do I not see my face?
Can I turn in my membership card to the human race?
Cause I gotta let go.

Nobody knows who you are
Nobody cares who you are
Nobody knows why you feel
Disconnected.

Well
I feel like I'm slowly goin' out of my head
When I'm battling the moments when I wish I was dead.
When my mind and body feel like fire and stone
And I know I'm gunna spend all my life alone.
And I swear I need to cover up my heart and soul,
I only gain perspective when I lose control.
Is it better to be cryin' when you feel insane,
Or laughin' out loud dancin' naked in the rain?

Have you ever felt the thunder inside your heart?
Holding onto all the shit that's going to tear you apart?

Nobody knows who you are

So I have felt uncomfortable in my body for a very long time but never questioned my gender until a couple of months ago. It's all I think about and every day I wake up questioning myself.

She broke into my journal and read up on how I would like to start taking the T and transition just so I feel better. Well, she came up to me and started gaslighting me, telling me that no one I know will support me in this. She told me to burn the book because I will never be who I think I am. About two years ago she told me I wasn't her daughter and now she was telling me it again. For the past year or so online I say I prefer they/them to keep it simple. It makes me really happy when someone uses they/them or he/him pronouns. So for the past 6 or so months, I have been saying I am genderfluid/gender flux.

2020-09-14 16:32:20,isoejj,8,1,"This is essentially my secondary account and boy will it be useful in this case because so far these feelings are ones I'm the least open about anywhere.

I've long had these feelings and I don't know how to place them. I'm often fine being masculine, I love my beard and don't ever want to get rid of it, yet there have been many times over my life where masculine is not how I felt and I have noticed that on hours/days where I've felt more feminine, the worst thing I can do is look in the mirror, because my body does not match how I feel and it can be upsetting in that seeing that incongruity in the mirror sort of forces me unwillingly back out. Now, to be honest too tho, most of the time I don't even feel one way or the other, fairly neutral, like it just doesn't matter to me. I have admitted that if I could have a do over in life, or like a genie appeared, I'd probably wish to be a woman. Again, though, I'd still prefer to feel neutral or one way or the other. Although, I don't have a day to day issue with the body I'm in, it's really just those times when I don't feel like it matches. And, they don't tend to happen as frequently either. I might go months and months where this feminine aspect doesn't pop up.

However, I'll throw this in there, I identify as grey-ace and rather recently I started cross dressing. I don't go as far with it as other cross dressers, no makeup, no breast forms, I just decided to buy outfits I like and the first time I threw it all on, I felt this palpable sense of relief. It was almost like my brain was like, ""Thank you!"" I've hung out a bit on cross dressing subreddits and I personally feel like sometimes I'm not doing it for the same reasons.

I was very close to someone, a lifelong friend, that I ended up in a relationship with and she was extremely perceptive and could often accurately tell when I was feeling that way. Because it wasn't just a feeling, but my voice would be less gruff, my body language would change. She'd often use that time to ask if she could do my nails or something, which was super sweet.

Ultimately, I like both, but I wish I could more frequently in society mix and mash, like a mix of both masc/fem clothing.

I just don't know, especially when I'm on this subreddit where I fit, but I want to explore it more and I feel like the more I know of myself, the more confident I might become in revealing these things to others.

I can always add more, I just don't know what and I have been looking a lot lately for where to put these experiences, but it's hard for me to know what these feelings are.

I\'m often fine being masculine, I love my beard and don\'t ever want to get rid of it, yet there have been many times over my life where masculine is not how I felt and I have noticed that on hours/days where I\'ve felt more feminine, the worst thing I can do is look in the mirror, because my body does not match how I feel and it can be upsetting in that seeing that incongruity in the mirror sort of forces me unwillingly back out. Now, to be honest too tho, most of the time I don\'t even feel one way or the other, fairly neutral, like it just doesn\'t matter to me. I have admitted that if I could have a do over in life, or like a genie appeared, I\'d probably wish to be a woman. Again, though, I\'d still prefer to feel neutral or one way or the other. Although, I don\'t have a day to day issue with the body I\'m in, it\'s really just those times when I don\'t feel like it matches. And, they don\'t tend to happen as frequently either. I might go months and months where this feminine aspect doesn\'t pop up.\n\nHowever, I\'ll throw this in there, I identify as grey-ace and rather recently I started cross dressing. I don\'t go as far with it as other cross dressers, no makeup, no breast forms, I just decided to buy outfits I like and the first time I threw it all on, I felt this palpable sense of relief. It was almost like my brain was like, ""Thank you!"" I\'ve hung out a bit on cross dressing subreddits and I personally feel like sometimes I\'m not doing it for the same reasons.

2020-09-14 19:54:46,issmhv,0,1,"Hello you beautiful people. I (36 AMAB and pre anything) am looking for ideas or stories on how you came out to your children. My son is 11 years old. My biggest concern is him being afraid of being bullied from it. He has had bully issues in the past already. Thankfully my wife and I are much more understanding than my parents were. My parents put me through conversion therapy and it made things extremely hard until I finally gave up on that stuff and came out to my wife. There are little things I have done his whole life while I was still in my own denial that will probably make more sense to him like have toes painted. 

Part of my upbringing was that men are strong, brave, and don't cry kind of toxicness so unfortunately I have echoed that early on in his life not realizing how wrong it was. But he most likely sees me as a ""man's man"" because of this so he might be shocked and confused as well. He is in therapy so he has a release outside of my wife and I if and when he is ready for that. 

I have only came out to myself and quickly after my wife for about 2 months now and I am still exploring everything with a willingness to do what feels right and good. I still question if I am genderfluid or MTF. And part of that exploring is to be my feminine side and not hide in the bedroom at night for my only time of doing it. I dont want to feel ashamed of it anymore and by hiding to be me is only making those shame feelings worse. I still have to figure it out and I know that but I dont want to rush into anything I might regret later. Of course my wife and I need to go over how we decide to handle this with our son before that happens as well but it would be nice to offer things that have helped make it smoother that others have done. Or maybe things to avoid that didn't workout so well as hard as that might be for sharing. Please feel free to private message me as well if you wish to keep it not open forum.

2020-09-15 17:26:57,itdcxp,6,1,"To elaborate on my title I've  been trying to find a correct label to use when describing myself to others. I've  only been able to start trying this around the time last year was ending,  when I realized that my agab no longer or perhaps never had fit me. 
Ever since then I've  been trying to stick to one thing, bouncing from male, to demiboy, to nonbinary, to agender specifically, sometimes feminine (but even when it's  feminine it's  not exactly female), I've  drawn beards on myself and felt great one day then felt super against it the next, I don't  like my chest even on feminine days, and I don't  normally want to express myself through ""feminine"" clothing like dresses but tend to verge on like bright rainbow colors, occasionally I do wear skirts if there are tights underneath, my expression seems to be all over the place and varies from day to day. 
(Would like to say here I know gender expression and your gender are seperate things but I am trying to describe how I myself handle it and how o do think my particular expression is tied to how I feel and what I myself consider feminine or masculine for myself. There are days where I felt more like a guy but still wanted to dress traditionally feminine..ly..)

And I'll  be honest part of me is against being genderfluid (not against people who identify as such, but for myself. It was actually my dad who stated I could be gender fluid and that it seemed obvious and that I might just be letting my fear guide my judgement). 
I've  been seen as impulsive in the past, I can be a sensitive person. 
I don't  want people to think when I feel masculine some days or feminine other that it's  me just picking and choosing and expecting them to keep up for attention or because it's  some impulsive fad. 
I also don't  want to be like, ""i'm  genderfluid.  I feel like a woman today call me she/her"" or ""I'm feel like a man today call me he/him."" And then if someone messes up feel bad about it, you know?  

Because I never let myself explore this possibility (I wanted to just find a single label I could find that fit me. Which has been hard due to people joking or me having this fear of judgment) I realized I haven't  done much looking into gender fluidity at all. 

Can anyone on here explain how being gender fluid feels to you? 
Do I seem gender fluid or is this a natural process to feel different ways when first learning to explore gender? 

For those of you that are gender fluid how do you handle not being set on any one thing (i.e. being fluid) does it ever get hard? 

Does it help to be mostly androgynous so that it's  easier to switch on each day? (Like for instance I have problems with my chest and my figure is mostly uniform aside from slightly curvy hips so I'm  asking if from the experience of others having a more androgynous figure helps) Like say I feel male one day then I can throw on a shirt and some jeans, paint on my beard and maybe tie up or shave my head? (Not going to extremes for these examples I have shaved my head.)
But also being able to throw on a skirt or put on lipstick or pad a bra, ect.. 
(Also I understand that men can wear makeup and woman can wear ""boy things"" or even grow a beard if they so chose, this is just a generalized example for my question, I don't  mind anyone who does these things if they fit outside my example)

I guess my main overarching question is how do you all manage to do it? 
Do you settle for a general pronoun for others to use so they don't  need to switch? Or do you focus on yourself and how you feel that day/moment? 

Has this caused problems? 

I'm  still open to picking out  a proper name for myself, if I ended up genderfluid would it be best to stick to something not too feminine and not too masculine? That way it always fits? 

I guess I'd  like to know more about others who are gender fluid so I can understand myself and if I fit or even if I don't  just be able to get a better understanding of you all. 

I'm  sorry in advance if anything I said is offensive or ignorant. I never let myself do to much research on this particular topic and am only allowing myself to look into it now. That is my fault but please understand I don't  want to hurt anyone.

I\'ve  only been able to start trying this around the time last year was ending,  when I realized that my agab no longer or perhaps never had fit me. \nEver since then I\'ve  been trying to stick to one thing, bouncing from male, to demiboy, to nonbinary, to agender specifically, sometimes feminine (but even when it\'s  feminine it\'s  not exactly female), I\'ve  drawn beards on myself and felt great one day then felt super against it the next, I don\'t  like my chest even on feminine days, and I don\'t  normally want to express myself through ""feminine"" clothing like dresses but tend to verge on like bright rainbow colors, occasionally I do wear skirts if there are tights underneath, my expression seems to be all over the place and varies from day to day. \n(Would like to say here I know gender expression and your gender are seperate things but I am trying to describe how I myself handle it and how o do think my particular expression is tied to how I feel and what I myself consider feminine or masculine for myself.

It was actually my dad who stated I could be gender fluid and that it seemed obvious and that I might just be letting my fear guide my judgement). \nI\'ve  been seen as impulsive in the past, I can be a sensitive person. \nI don\'t  want people to think when I feel masculine some days or feminine other that it\'s  me just picking and choosing and expecting them to keep up for attention or because it\'s  some impulsive fad. \nI also don\'t  want to be like, ""i\'m  genderfluid.  I feel like a woman today call me she/her"" or ""I\'m feel like a man today call me he/him."" And then if someone messes up feel bad about it, you know?  \n\nBecause I never let myself explore this possibility (I wanted to just find a single label I could find that fit me.

I‚Äôm a 24yo afab and I‚Äôm questioning my gender. I have for almost a year now. For some people, gender is super important to who they are and expressing it makes them feel good. But there are days when I feel like a girl, others gender less, and others like a dude. At least in my current relationship (first with a girl after realizing I‚Äôm queer), most of the time I enjoy doing the stereotypical manly things like taking care of spiders, being the big spoon, and being nice and thicc and strong to hold my gf when she jumps on me like in The Notebook. Part of me likes that manly role. And on some days, I feel like dressing like a dude and hiding my hair under a hat. Other days, I feel somewhat feminine and nurturing. Today I just dyed my hair bright pink for the first time and it feels good because I‚Äôve had the feeling I might be nb but always associated being nb with a certain look (I.e. not feminine or masculine, hair dyed, piercings and skinny). I also feel like less of a woman because I‚Äôm fat (which shouldn‚Äôt be a negative term but society uses it like that) and not super into girly clothes or behaviors. I like doing makeup sometimes but my gf is a pro at it and I‚Äôm lucky to get the mascara correct.

It‚Äôs just when I feel like a girl, I think I‚Äôm cis. On other days, I try to use excuses like having a rough childhood (trauma, anxiety, depression) and being unable to decide things for myself to explain the weird gender stuff. Maybe I‚Äôm just exploring my gender expression. For a while I thought I was a trans man.

I wish there was a checklist for this

Part of me thinks gender is a social construct anyway and no one fits perfectly into male or female ‚Äîbut at the same time all genders are valid!! I guess gender is weird to me personally.

My gf asks me the button question (if you could press a button and be born a cis guy from the start would you do it?) and I always say that I really don‚Äôt care but don‚Äôt want facial hair. And honestly I would love to do stuff to her back end with my parts if I had them... 

Gender is weird. I think I‚Äôm gender fluid. I need to realize that I can be gender fluid and call myself a girl sometimes because my gender moves. It has a mind of its own. It‚Äôs aliiiiive

2020-09-16 03:17:24,itnq6z,0,1,"(Reposting from r/lgbt since I felt like I would get better help/answers/whatever here.)

I have a few things to talk about here, so sorry for the length.

So, in the past months, I've been thinking about my gender more and more. I've always identified as a cis female, so this is relatively new for me. I do know at least a little about LGBT since I identify as panromantic, and I have looked into genders and pronouns simply to try and support others, but now I feel different.

So I feel as though I may be gender fluid. I can always remember feeling like a girl (most of the time) and feeling like a boy (1/3 of the time). Now that I'm a little older, I also recognize that I've felt non-binary too.

Now here are some of my concerns. I'm 15. I feel like I'm too young to be making these decisions. I'm on anti-depressants, on a hormonal birth control shot, and all of that affects my mood and mindset, plus the regular hormones that come with being 15. I understand that gender is a spectrum, and that I may change over time, but I feel like if I make a definitive decision, I'll have to stick with it.

I also feel like a fraud. I've always admired trans and genderqueer people for how brave and beautiful they are, and I feel like I'm just doing this to be like them. There are a lot of trans and enby people at my school too, so am I just doing this to fit in?

I also worry about how my family will perceive me. They have mentioned on multiple occasions how they are so proud to have a girl, and how they wouldn't want me to be a boy. I feel like I've already let my Christian mom down enough by going out as pan and an atheist.

One last worry; I feel like I'm not worthy enough to change my gender. I've never really had dysphoria and based on what my mom has told me, I've never asked to be called a boy when I was younger, so am I less deserving? I like my chest and genitals, so can I not be a boy? I also like stereotypical girl things like makeup and dresses, so am I not allowed to feel like a boy?

I just don't know if there is a specific *feeling* that I'm supposed to get whenever I want to be perceived as a boy. Sure, sometimes a lady will call me a sir and I'll get a happy feeling, and sometimes I'll get called a sir and I'll correct them. Is that the feeling? It just feels like some switch should be flipped in my head where I just feel more like the gender I want to be perceived as.

On the other hand,  I do feel valid sometimes. I've always wanted an androgynous look, and since I cit my hair into a boyish cut, I've felt so much better. I've also found myself not really caring what pronouns people used for me depending on my mood. Some days I don't care if I'm a boy or a girl or neither and some days I'm strictly a girl.

I'm just confused and I would like some answers if anyone can provide. I know that there probably won't be any definitive answers, but if anyone can offer a little advice, that would be nice. Thank you for reading.

It just feels like some switch should be flipped in my head where I just feel more like the gender I want to be perceived as.\n\nOn the other hand,  I do feel valid sometimes. I've always wanted an androgynous look, and since I cit my hair into a boyish cut, I've felt so much better. I've also found myself not really caring what pronouns people used for me depending on my mood. Some days I don't care if I'm a boy or a girl or neither and some days I'm strictly a girl.\n\nI'm just confused and I would like some answers if anyone can provide. I know that there probably won't be any definitive answers, but if anyone can offer a little advice, that would be nice. Thank you for reading.\n\n(I may edit this post if anything else comes to mind)"", 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'I think I may be genderfluid', 'created': 1600251444.0}"

I figured out that I was pansexual in 4th grade, and have questioned my gender a lot, especially since I started becoming more familiar with LGBT+ media. Throughout my life, I've noticed a bit of a trend, where I will have a generally feminine vibe and/or identity for a long period of time, sometimes barely a few months, sometimes up to around two years. I also would sometimes have days where I would want to be the other gender, thinking I looked too female or too male. When I was little, I kind of wrote this off as being a phase, my style changing, that kind of thing. As I've gotten older though, the lines between male and female are much less blurred and it has become much harder to go back and forth. Generally, I spend more time feeling feminine than I do masculine, but there are certainly days where I feel more masculine than feminine. Particularly in 5th and 6th grade, I cut my hair in a fade and wore button-downs and ties to special occasions. I would also get very excited if someone in public mistook me for a boy or called me ""Young man."" I considered that I was perhaps gender fluid but I don't know if gender-fluid people stay in one gender for as long as I stay in one gender vibe. Also, I don't feel like ""he"" or ""she"" fits me, as I said, ""gender vibe"", not gender. Some days it doesn't bother me; I've grown up with everyone referring to me as ""she"" and ""her"", so it just kind of blends into the background. However, on the days when I start feeling like I'm ""too female"", I notice it a lot. I don't think my actual gender fluctuates solidly, but on my more male days, I catch myself wanting to be more ""manly"" and get annoyed at myself. Vice versa with prominently female days and wishing I was more girly. The point is, my gender itself doesn't change, I don't really feel uncomfortable in my body most days, but I usually lean towards one gender or the other, and as I get older, it gets harder to do that. The days where the gender I lean towards has been changing more often, so I figured I should get some advice. Is it just phases? Is it just my brain coming up with a way to be an attention seeker? Should I leave it alone or ask more questions, try and figure myself out? I might switch between pronouns, but I'm okay with my body and don't really experience dysphoria, so a little confused on what's going on with me.

2020-09-20 04:05:24,iw70pw,12,1,"Hi, I actually post on this sub under my regular username, but I'm feeling vulnerable and I'm worried someone will use that to hurt me on my regular account. You know, you make someone angry and suddenly they cyber-stalk you and normally I have a thick suit of armor, but this is something that as I'm exploring could be used to hurt me. Anyway, sorry for all the preamble, I'm sure you've used your share of alt accounts.

While I can't speak for too much of my life prior to my teens, it's foggy as fuck and I'm 35. I do very much remember wishing I was a woman during my teens. My outlet over the years was in the short stories and novels I could write myself into the female characters. And, of course game characters, if I could choose it was always women. These feelings hung around and through most of my 20's I'd be aware there were times when I very clearly felt I was femme and I'll be honest, sometimes those experiences were so strong that I'd research them. Of course, I was a hobbyist psychologist, so I'd end up wondering if I was dissociating or something. Though, that never made sense, eventually I just told myself I had a strong feminine side and left it at that. And, it didn't bother me much.

However, around the age of 29, I confessed a lot of my feelings and someone pointed me in the direction of genderfluid. I ended up researching it, but strangely, unlike before where I was cool with having a feminine side, this time I buried that shit deep. It literally has not seen the light of day for 6 years, anytime I had even a transient moment to the contrary, I'd strangle it out.

That is until recently, very recently. In May these feelings bubbled to the surface again and I said, ""Fine, you can pick out an outfit."" The day that came in and I threw it on, it was unbelievable euphoria, I felt like my whole body and mind were just saying, ""Thank you, thank you, thank you!"" However, I still said, ok, you can be a cross dresser. But, it didn't end there, I had opened the floodgates and around July I was like, no, there's much more here, these feelings are strong. And, because I felt like I'd go back and forth and sometimes just feel neutral, I landed on genderfluid.

And, I've been content with that, but now here we are in Sept and I just don't know. There's been a few times where I've felt sorta miserable and would think, ""If I was braver, I'd go all the way [to Trans]"" I just spent the good part of last 6 days femme and I could tell around Thursday it was sort of waning. Strangely, during that time femme, I was happy as could be, I wasn't questioning or confused. But, I've been back to masc and that's when all these feeling came out, I've been dealing with them in stride, but just tonight I was about to hop in the shower and some reason I decided to just sit on the edge of the tub and go through some of the posts here and I saw so many of you presenting femme and I just started crying. I felt upset, like one thought that went through my head was, would I be happier as a woman? I only get one life to live, would staying a man end up being my biggest regret? I don't know and I feel to some degree, I'd rather have more time to let these feeling develop. Maybe it's just I was in the closet for so damn long and this is all so new to me. I've been level-headed and I'd prefer to work through these feelings, but I almost couldn't believe that reaction I had tonight.

I have been searching for genderfluid support online pretty much since I went back to masc, but it seems to be lacking. I've also heard of gender based therapists and I've wondered if that's a good avenue at all. I think there have been times over the last couple days where I've even thought to myself, you shouldn't have opened those floodgates at all, you didn't have these questions, or that's probably not true because something caused me to open them in the first place. Maybe it doesn't go beyond that even, I'm experiencing a lot of emotions that I haven't had to grapple with, maybe it makes sense that euphoria would need to be met equally with dysphoria, I don't know. I didn't know what imposter syndrome was either until recently, but I can definitely say over the last few months I've dealt with it a lot. And, so I'm just struggling.

I found out about 5 years ago that my body had stopped producing testosterone, just bye bye. I went on HRT because my doc recommended it and I stuck with it for a year, but notably, these feelings and I even wondered if my identifying as Ace would suddenly change, but none of it did and eventually I just said, screw it, I don't care to keep with it. So, I've been off Testosterone for the last 4 years.

I'm sorry, I needed to vent, but it's been difficult for me to parse all these new feelings. I am happy, though to not be forcing myself in the closet anymore. Over the years when redditors would confuse me on my account and refer to me as she, what a great feeling.

It's my first post here and I thought I'll ask what's been on my mind lately... 

So it's been about 3 months since I have found out about the term genderfluid. It brought this feeling of freedom all of a sudden. 

For as long as I can remember I have always felt like a boy who dresses like a girl. I was born a woman and this masculinity of mine was always hidden and hard to explain. I have thought about changing my body, like 6 years ago, but then realised I liked it the way it was. So the boy in me was, I thought, a phase. But it would come out in my daydreaming, and it would feel great. Anyhow since finding out about genderfluidity, I feel much better with myself, and even a stranger told me recently that she thought I was a ""pretty boy"" which is probably the compliment I might have waited my whole life!! 


It stays new to me and I'm still questioning everything. For example: shifting. I don't feel the need to shift at all, I want to be this inbetween constantly. My behaviour, and  internal feelings are seemingly enough to me... Is that right?


Also, I didn't change my pronouns (she/her) because I like them the way they are and if I'm fully honest, the boy in me enjoys being a ""she""... is this ok?


If these descriptons don't seem to fit genderfluidity, does anyone know what I am lol?


I thought I could be honest here and it may be the only place where I can. I'd love to here about more experiences and share with some of you too. It's a bit of a lonely journey for me...

2020-09-21 07:49:45,iww126,1,1,"Hey all! This is a long one. I'm very sorry that its as long as it is.. TLDR at bottom of post.

I came out as genderfluid officially 2 years ago.

My significant other is female. I was afab. Shes the only one who knows. We have been dating fkr 4 years.

Here's the thing:

I told her before we started dating that I felt like I might be demi-boy (the only phrase i was aware of at the time. That was ~4 years ago). She acknowledged it and said she didnt care, she liked me for me.

Fast forward 2 years i decided to explore that part of me. Cue genderfluidity. I told her. She lost it. Said a lot of very hurtful things. Arguments. I reversed back into my shell. We didnt talk about it again.

About a year later i did something or said something that brought it up again. She sat me down and we had a very long discussion about how very sorry she was about the things she said, about her ignorance about it all and how she is fully adamant in proving how sorry she is by trying to support me and SHOW me she has grown and learned instead of just a ""sorry"" and never acknowledging it again.

Thats all fine and dandy, except when she tries to be supportive I shut down. Hard. I start getting irritable, borderline mean. Curt. Feel ashamed. Cue my anxiety disorder!

And yet I feel completely unacknowledged (to no fault of her own. I see how hard shes trying and how badly she wants to support me but when i get in my shut down mode I basically tell her dont acknowledge it dont talk about it etc.)

She wants to know how she can best support me which is awesome. She wants to put in effort. Problem is, I'm too fricking scared to ask her to do things or say things or tell her in general what she can do to make me feel more comfortable. This next part is gross so if youre squeamish or dont wanna read about breast medical conditions skip the next part.

Oh one more cue! Ductal. Ectesia. A condition in the breast that causes discharge out of the nipple. Very painful for me (I wont get very graphic with it but it is not fun.). 

My brain says ""FINALLY! A REASON TO GET RID OF THESE THINGS ON YOUR CHEST!"" My anxiety says ""Your girlfriend will 100% for sure leave you if you get rid of them. Oh its painful? That sucks. Suck it up butter cup. Youre stuck with this forever.""

Its not like I'll die if I never hear her call me handsome but I would give anything in the world to hear those words come out of her mouth... I'm just so terrified that what happened before is going to happen again. But she's put forward so much effort in trying to prove she has learned and grown from that thought process (she needed to do some of her own soul searching to understand why it upset her so much. She did figure it out, and truly is doing much better.)

Also, for a AMAB genderfluid individual that wants to express themselves in a feminine way, it's far, Far, FAR easier to get female clothing and accessories now thanks to online shopping.

One HUGE barrier to gender roles in the 20th century was salesclerks and brick and mortar stores.  All it would take is one bigoted, narrow-minded, unpleasant salesclerk and you could have a VERY bad day.

One day, circa 1999, I wanted to buy some feminine clothing.  I didn't have a car, and public transportation in the city I lived in was awful.  So, I walked an hour to a mall and went to a big anchor-store department store.  I'd measured myself many times, I knew my sizes.  I went around the store picking out a small wardrobe for myself.  I got funny stares from some salespeople, but they conspicuously did NOT offer to help.  They'd watch me, but never ask if they could help.

I remember taking this armload of clothes; a couple of skirts and blouses, a dress or two, a pair of shoes, and some lingerie and I think a purse or two, to a salescounter to check out.  

The clerk was a very old woman.  I put the clothing on the counter and got out my wallet.  I was nervous about taking my first big steps into expressing my feminine aspects. . .and it got worse when the clerk opened her mouth.

""You aren't doing anything funny with little kids, now are you?""

I was shocked.  I stammered out a no, and heard her explain that there was no way a gentleman would be buying all these various clothes for a ""lady"", hence I had to be buying them all for myself, which meant I was a ""pervert"" and hence a child molester, and she told me to get out of the store right now before she called the police to report a child molester in the store.  

I remembered having a shocked look, she had a mean sneer at me as she said it.  I stepped back and darted out a nearby door of the store and was scared and upset as I began the long walk home.  

That clerk missed out on the commission from several hundred dollars worth of sales just to accuse me of being a pedophile for buying feminine clothing.  I called to complain when I got home, got the General Manager of the store, who offered a tepid, half-hearted apology and said she was a longtime employee who was about to retire and said he'd have a talk with her about being friendlier to customers, and that's the most he would do.  The store went out of business about a year later.

After that, it was only online shopping for me, which was a lot harder back then.  To this day, I still don't have the courage to shop for anything really distinctly feminine in person, too many bad memories of that old saleslady calling me a pedophile because I was trying to buy femme clothes.",genderfluid,One way the internet helped fuel the acceptance of genderfluidity. . .online shopping (no bigoted salesclerks),1600724542.0,"{'created_utc': 1600699342, 'id': 'ix1q45', 'num_comments': 1, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'It\'s so much easier to be genderfluid now.

2020-09-22 00:40:34,ixd4pm,8,1,"If you've read my recent posts you'll know I've been biding my time to re-address the conversation with my GF regarding my crossdressing - I opened up to her a year ago and she quite brutally shut me down. I assumed she shut me down out of panic and not understanding what it means to be a straight crossdresser (I guessed she assumed the worst) and she buried her head in the sand.


Well, this weekend turned out to be, or so I thought, the right time to re-address it.¬†


After speaking to our gay neighbour about his own LGBTQI+ experiences, my GF said if anyone ever told her they were, say, non-binary, or genderfluid for example, that she'd be interested and intrigued, and that she fully supports self-expression. This got me thinking back to a year ago when I opened up about my crossdressing and she was neither interested, intrigued, nor supportive, but was in fact the complete opposite - she was downright brutal in her shutdown of the conversation.


The next day I queried why she would be interested in other people, but when I opened up that couldn't be further from the truth. The conversation evolved, there were some tears, and it transpired (and I quote) ""I'm only open-minded when it doesn't affect me personally"" - this sentence came up a few times. She doesn't want a crossdressing boyfriend, husband, father to her kids etc. and that's final.


I tried to put forward a few valid points - it's more popular than you think, there are supportive partners out there, it's separate to sexuality &amp; gender. I tried to educate her on the terminology - crossdresser, drag queen, genderfluid, non-binary etc. and encouraged her to maybe read into it so she could try and understand me better. She was completely against that idea and ""doesn't want to know"".


She is 100% stuck in her views on this and assured me she will never change, and that she never wants to have this conversation again. One of her fears was the humiliation she would face if anyone ever found out (family, friends etc.) and I tried to assure her that it was a purely private matter, behind closed doors and that no one would ever find out. She also made it clear that if I wanted to dress up now, or in 10/20/30 years she would likely leave, regardless of our relationship.


I'm now stuck between a rock and a hard place - on the outside our relationship is nothing short of perfect. We got referred to as couple goals by some friends a while back - we never argue, we share interests, we want the same things and we are an incredible match for each other in every way....except this one stumbling block. Is crossdressing a big enough factor in my life to justify how I move forward? Or is this just the one main sacrifice I will have to make (I mean, everyone makes a sacrifice or two, right?). I can genuinely say this is the only barrier to this relationship succeeding. I see so many amazing stories of supportive partners and it pains me to know I'll never have that with this girl.


Crossdressing is now 100% off limits FOR LIFE. Like, I would even struggle to do it in secret. How will this affect me in a few years? How big will the urge become? Will I resent her for this? She's made it clear she will never change her mind on this, so I have to weigh up what I value more - my relationship with an otherwise incredible girl, or the urge to crossdress once a week?


Anyway, I know I'll only get a load of comments saying ""leave her!"" but it's not quite that straightforward - is crossdressing that big a sacrifice to make? Perhaps not, perhaps it's just a frustrating one that I have to learn to live with. Perhaps it will get too much in a few years, but who's to say? For now it will have to be firmly buried and never spoken of again.¬†

About a month ago I figured out I am genderfluid. Previously I went by a sort of trans femme-androgynous nonbinary-ness.


One thing about being genderfluid thats been getting to me is having dysphoria that fluctuates between wanting to be masculine feminine or feminine leaning. I'm AMAB, but when I looked at myself in the mirror yesterday I was horrified to see how feminine my face has become.



On top of this, I was recently discovered that I'm also intersex. Due to my intersexuality, estrogen has been having a field day with my already feminine body.

Context: I've only recently realised that I'm gender fluid (AFAB) and haven't told my family who I still live with. 

I'm walking down to the local shops with my Mum, wearing a black hoodie and tracksuit pants that have a jean-like colour. I'm also wearing a plain black mask and have boy-short hair. She wants to go into the butcher to buy meat (not important what), and so I stay outside because the butcher only allows two customers at a time inside. There's a large window that I can see the counter, display and Mum, and watch her pointing to the wrong type of meat, and start gently knocking on the window to get her attention. She's nearly deaf so it takes the butcher several attempts to make her realise I'm trying to catch her attention, and when she does I try to communicate my disagreement on what she's buying, and end up just poking my head around the door and telling her. 

In any case, she buys what she wants to, and we start heading home. Along the way, Mum tells me the butcher was telling her that 'her son' was trying to get her attention. Mum laughs and says 'clearly you're my daughter' and I laugh too but at the fact this butcher who is a stranger has more sensitivity to gender presentation and picked up what I was doing. It felt so good to hear someone say I was a son and not a daughter, and this small act has kept me flying for days.

I know that perhaps with the mask, short hair, and clothes anyone could pick me out as a guy, but I do have a noticeable chest and I don't bind (yet).

So I have been thinking this off and on for the past decade,

In fact, I hated the fact that due to my dysphoria, a lot of the more masculine things that I want to do and take part in makes me feel bad. But I also wonder if this is dysphoria, or if I am just using dysphoria as a way to counteract my fetish anxiety. 

I have a very strong fetish towards mens asses. But that made me feel uncomfortable wearing typical male clothing as it felt like I was somewhat engaging in sexual pratices while wearing them. It felt odd for me to wear mens clothing, almost as if I was crossdressing. 

I have boobs now due to HRT, and I like them, but I someties want to bind them and dress and identify as a dude. That would probably make things a lot easier in terms of sexism as well. 

I already wear mostly gender neutral clothing, don't brush my hair often, and generally not give a crap about fashion and makeup.

I'm 25 years old and up until now have considered myself as a cis male. Over the last few years I've experimented a little bit more with dressing femme in private and I have enjoyed it even thought generally it felt like it was done as an arousal thing. 

I often find myself wanting to present more femme/androgynous and some days definitely feel more girly than others. However I don't feel as though I have dysphoria or anything as I'm generally happy with my body and don't wish I had breasts or anything (although breastplates have been something I've found intriguing). 

Never have I ever felt like I'd want anything to be permanent, which is why I don't think I'm trans. But I sometimes fantasize about that because it would mean I'd be able to present differently, although the issue is it would be permanent.

I guess I've very, very recently realised that this could put me in the genderfluid camp, but I don't really know what I do with myself after accepting or realising that lol.

I'm pansexual and poly, so I have two lovely partners who would be absolutely accepting, I just kinda wanna figure out what I identify as before I bring it up to them.

When I discovered genderfluid it made sense. It all just made sense. I feel like sometimes I‚Äôm really hard on the masc side, sometimes on the femme side, sometimes androgyne, and sometimes just completely agender.

I love the *feel* of it, but still am surprised by it when I look in the mirror while I‚Äôm femme.

I was raised in an extremely religious household and always told ‚Äúa woman shall not wear anything that pertains to a man‚Äù and vice versa, and even though I walked away from that all a long time ago I never really thought about it too much and have always bought women‚Äôs clothing.

Recently I‚Äôve started thinking about getting a binder and buying some men‚Äôs clothes to wear, and feel like that would allow me to lean more into my masc and androgyne times. But right now all changing rooms are closed and I can‚Äôt buy clothes without trying them on.

I will feel more masculine, feminine, or even enby at different times, and my behavior will reflect that in my speech and dress. There are times when I've gone out of my way to dress in a more masculine manner, even though it goes against my agab-- but even if I'd been forced to wear feminine clothing I don't think I'd have been that upset or uncomfortable. I'd have preferred to wear the masculine clothes, but it wouldn't have been the end of the world to wear a skirt or a dress. I act very masculine at times at work, and sometimes I'll refer to myself as a guy, but I've never felt the need to ask anyone to use any other pronouns for me other than she/her-- I'm not out to anyone, this is still a pretty new idea to me (though once, one of my coworkers said something like ""lol you're not a girl, you're a dude who stole a vagina"" on a masc day and it made me feel so loved.)

And, while I don't know the religious makeup of all of you, I don't wish to offend. However, I knew from the age of 6 that religion was not for me. Long before I formed any opinions on the god question itself, I just knew I didn't care for religion.

Well, of course how I felt on that matter didn't mean anything and I would have to go to church and attend CCD (I'm not sure how recognizable that is, but it's like after school Catholic education.)

Around the age of 10 I was just hanging out and I was wearing a pair of my mothers high heels. Suddenly she came tearing in in a rush, time to go to CCD, we're late. She's so distracted she doesn't notice I'm in heels. She doesn't notice even as she watches me hop out of the car and she drives away. To be kinda honest, I forgot I was wearing them, but I've always been a rebellious type, so I'm just like, screw it, damn right I'm wearing heels!

Within 10 mins, this did not go unnoticed, I'm sent down to one of the priests who calls my mother to come down there. Well, my mother arrives and the priest says, ""His kind aren't welcome in the church. You can teach him the way of the Lord at home, but he can't come here anymore."" He gave my mother all the CCD study material, a bible, and off we went.

And, that's how I got myself out of CCD by accident.
