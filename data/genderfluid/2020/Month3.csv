However, I do theater and because my voice is relatively low and because there just happen to be few boys who do theater in the schools I've been in, I have ended up with many roles as male characters (in fact i think i've had more masculine than feminine roles, out of all the plays i've been in). And being a cis girl old enough to use reddit, I have the obvious problem of my chest getting in the way of me being able to fully portray a man on stage. I couldn't find any subreddits specifically about binding (which I've tried irl, didn't work out), and although I am in the big boob problems and a bra that fits subreddits, those subreddits are more about fit/comfort and less about trying to make yourself look flatter.

2020-03-01 08:29:59,fbr8ja,1,1,"Hi everyone!

(Firstly, sorry for the crappy title, but I would like the opinions of both AFAB and AMAB people!) 

I'm going to be flying to Spain for a weekend in May and I'm considering spending the entire time as my female self, including the flights to and from London-Spain. I'm going to be with friends so I'm not worried about how I'll be perceived or any reactions the locals may have because I know my friends will have my back, but I'm a bit concerned about the practicalities of the flights themselves and travelling through the airport etc. 

Obviously, I need to book the ticket in my legal, male, name and use my legal, male, passport but I'll be presenting as female so I'm curious as to how I'll be handled when going through passport control and other security checks etc. 

Has anyone had experience of this? How did you find it? Was it smoother in one direction than the other? Would be good to know anyone's thoughts! 

On another note, I need to renew my passport before I leave. I'm not sure if I should wear a bit of makeup on my picture or not?

1. I‚Äôm doing my best to use their new desired name. Which is a very male name, and nothing like their given name, so it‚Äôs been sorta hard for me to remember and seems weird to say out loud. Like at a store this weekend, while they have long blond hair and look very feminine, I‚Äôm supposed to call to them down the aisle ‚Äúhey Robert,‚Äù for example. I did it, but it‚Äôs just weird. Is it horrible that I wish they picked a more gender neutral name?

2. My next concern is they keep talking about ‚ÄúDead Names.‚Äù Which honestly hurts me so much to hear. They told me that‚Äôs the proper term for the name you had before the one you pick. But I poured my heart into naming her. It was a task of great importance to me and her dad, especially as our first child. We toiled over lists and suggestions and tried to make sure her name was something really special. So to just hear them say the name is now ‚Äúdead,‚Äù like they truly always hated what we created, just plain hurts. 

3. It‚Äôs super hard to talk about memories from long ago using the new name. Like this weekend we were looking at photo albums from 10 years ago. I just felt like it was appropriate to say her given name talking about the pictures and stories from that time. Is it generally acceptable to use birth names when talking about events before changing to a new name? They seemed ok with it, but it‚Äôs hard to tell...

.
So heres my tale, I was AFAB, and grew up as a girl until I was about 16-17. I didnt know there were other options, and I learned  bit more about gender identity, and then thought, that's cool! And set it aside. Then i woke up one morning and looked in the mirror and, i cant describe it but, I saw a boy. I was just suddenly a trans boy, and now I'm 23, and I've done hormone therapy for 5 years.
.
But yesterday I looked in the mirror and, at first I thought I missed something, but I looked again and I saw a girl? I talked a little to my partner about it, and asked them to try using the terms boyfriend, girlfriend, and partner in reference to me... and girlfriend was the only one that I ID'd with.
.
I've been so sure about being a trans man for so long, and I'm very passable as a man. All my family calls me a man, my work calls me a man, friends and strangers all call me a man. I CALLED ME A MAN. Am I broken for feeling like this?? Is this what genderfluid is, does it switch back? 
.
(I dont regret transitioning hormonally at all, but my usual dysphoria is gone around my chest and such. I dont want to de-transition either, because aside from shaving body hair and feeling super confident in feminine clothes, I still like my body well enough)

Then i woke up one morning and looked in the mirror and, i cant describe it but, I saw a boy. I was just suddenly a trans boy, and now I'm 23, and I've done hormone therapy for 5 years.\n.\nBut yesterday I looked in the mirror and, at first I thought I missed something, but I looked again and I saw a girl? I talked a little to my partner about it, and asked them to try using the terms boyfriend, girlfriend, and partner in reference to me... and girlfriend was the only one that I ID'd with.\n.\nI've been so sure about being a trans man for so long, and I'm very passable as a man. All my family calls me a man, my work calls me a man, friends and strangers all call me a man. I CALLED ME A MAN. Am I broken for feeling like this?? Is this what genderfluid is, does it switch back? \n.\n(I dont regret transitioning hormonally at all, but my usual dysphoria is gone around my chest and such. I dont want to de-transition either, because aside from shaving body hair and feeling super confident in feminine clothes, I still like my body well enough)\n.\nPlease feel free to comment and tell me your thoughts! I have no idea what's going on but I've heard of genderfluid and I thought I'd ask!

I was taken aback by this question, and now I start to ask myself...what do I prefer? I'm a female, but sometimes I feel as if I have someone who is male inside of me, if that makes sense. Other times, it's just someone who's extremely feminine, and or just super masculine, or neither or both. My therapist said something about maybe it was DID or something, and that could be it, but I just dont know! 

I answered the question honestly, ""I don't know, you can refer to me as whatever"" 

I've become more confused about my gender recently, and I feel as if being genderfluid is really confusing for me (no offense to anyone reading this)

I dont know my preferred pronouns
I want to understand better
I need more advice

Heres the thing, I'm in my early twenties, born female but the problem is.. i dont really feel like a girl. I never did. Nearly all my early experiences with girls have been bullies and surface level beauty. Which is by no means a label for all girls, its simply what ive experienced up to that point, I'm very sorry if it comes off as snobby to anyone here im sure most of you are lovely people. Anyway, the point of that was to show that hey, maybe im not struggling with gender but rather some sort of biase based off of negative past events that ive mostly since gotten over.  Anyway i always wanted to be a boy, yet every once a blue moon still enjoyed feeling cute in a girlish kinda way. I akways sort of just loved the connection boys have with their friends and such, the toys, the clothes  basically just the surface level stereotypes that imo shouldnt even exist. 

So thats the grimy confusing sort of surface of my problem here. Back to the present, the now. In all honesty, most the time I feel hugely out of place in a group of girls. I often catch nyself thinking something along the lines of ""ugh this is awkward im literally the only guy here..."" which is strange now that i think of it. Im oddly secretly happy when people confuse me for a boy. And i feel most at home among a group of my male friends as i feel like its my place, im with others who are like me. Then i feel sad because i realize, i am a female biologically, they probably dont even really think of me as a gu. Even if im quite the mushy person people typically associate with the female gender.
Then comes the confusing part that brought me to this sub i hope will be loving and understanding. I have times when i honestly feel like a girl and happy to be one! Theres no pattern or sort of trigger to these days that ive noticed, but on these days i dont feel out of olace with a group of girls. In fact, i feel quite pretty and happy to be a part of the little circle. I feel more wary of men as men and not just another guy like myself. 
My sexuality doesnt change during these bouts, i very much prefer men as partners. I havent explored the other gender romantically despite a couple crushes i rarely even count because im unsure of what I'd actually do with them. I dont act on them aside from compliments and playfully calling them wives and fantasizing a little hit just out of wonder of what itd be like so to this day i do consider myself straight at least i think I am. 
I came here for advice on how to deal with this/accept it of its anything more than a fluke in my little peanut brain. I went to a friend today about it but he found it just stupid as most people that i know would. I just know theyd go the whole ahahaha youre gonna start going down that whole cringey made up gender crap for attention now huh, youre just trying to be ""not like the other girls"".

I am afab, been raised female for 20 years of life.  Recently (as in literally only a few months ago, October I think) I came out to myself as non-binary.  Except... while that seemed *more* correct than female, it wasn‚Äôt a perfect fit, and I ended up trying REALLY hard to fit my gender expression into the ‚Äúnon-binary‚Äù category  i.e. only wore button ups and jeans for a while.  Eventually I just kept feeling uncomfortable like that so went to just wearing baggy flannels and jumpers (still gender neutral but not very euphoric).

Then as I got more comfortable with my non-binary identity, I also began to get more comfortable with my gender expression.  Eventually this boiled down to one weird (and amazing) day when I was out thrift shopping with friends and found this amazing masculine blazer that fit me so well and felt so nice.  I paired it with a masc dress shirt a pair of men‚Äôs dress shoes and literally for the first time in my life felt true gender euphoria.

Thing is, it‚Äôs not like that every day.  Some days, that just looks and feels like cross dressing.  Sometimes, I‚Äôm actually quite comfortable in a femm cut jumper or even a skirt, but most days that also feels like cross dressing.

A couple things I‚Äôm certain of though: one, about 80% of my days are just fully non-binary, completely in the middle and no identifying with a certain gender.  And two, when I do feel more masc or femm, it is *never* from binary to binary, never fully man and never fully woman.

So I (AMAB) have been going out more often as my alternate self lately, and I've been dressing myself in more casual femme clothing. While I like to wear things like dresses and things that are a bit more revealing, I sometimes don't put up the effort to really ""do myself up"" for that. 

Over the last couple months though, as it's been warming up, I've been dressing in more casual wear, like skinny jeans and nicer shirts (versus dresses and tights), over the typical nicely fitting (sometimes padded) bra to give myself a little bit of a chest. 

I started to get into my skirts to wear out, as I like to wear them with a pair of thin tights, sometimes getting away with not doing that because I'm just comfortable in whatever skirt that day. I have a couple pairs of short shorts that I like to wear, but never wear out, and it feels like it's for a weird reason that I don't. 

Now, to the question: Do you find shorts sometimes more expose you (than say, a short skirt) when you're out dressed?

2020-03-14 08:22:22,fif92l,0,1,"Hi. Posted here a bit ago when my child revealed to me they are gender fluid and concerns I had about their new chosen name. 

Well now family is used to it. We all use the new name. BUT now I‚Äôve realized they haven‚Äôt told their friends yet... and I had a heart to heart with them about it tonight. And discovered they are scared to make this request/announcement. 

I have no clue how to advise them. I‚Äôm totally ready to call the school principal and make new name official. This should not be any issue in our district. But teachers aren‚Äôt the worry. 

I think reality is sinking in with them. Once friends know and start using the new name... then everyone knows. And people will ask‚Äî what‚Äôs with the new name? Why? And some are surely going to say the name doesn‚Äôt make sense or seem normal, etc. 

How can my daughter (she did say it‚Äôs fine to refer to her as she in general), ‚Äúroll out‚Äù her new name with minimal teasing and requests for explanation that really only is one that leads to whole conversation about her gender identity? She‚Äôs at heart VERY shy and sensitive. 

We have the ‚Äúbonus‚Äù of time to plan and talk her closest friends before this happens at school, because there is no school for at least two weeks due to coronavirus. 

Any advice?

I‚Äôve been struggling to find something that feels comfortable (and whole concept of choosing your own name feels so strange to me) so I asked her for advice because she knows me and my personality. She basically shrugged this off by sending me a link to a random list of neutral names.

This was a few weeks ago and I‚Äôve been feeling bad cos maybe it was too much to ask of her but the other day she told me she wanted to change her name.

I always knew I was different from all the kids, described myself as a tomboy because I was like the boys some days and the girls on others. After living under my grandmother's religious guilt, I learned to repress it all in. Until I went to art school and met a trans person. Wanting to be inclusive I looked up a list of LBGTQ+ terms so that I could understand what being trans truly meant other than the obvious. Well, that's when I discovered the term genderfluid, and something in me just clicked.

Never had I heard of other people who felt like me. The revelation was almost overwhelming, and having been distanced from my grandmother for a time, I began to explore what it meant to me. A year later, I'm in the shower texting my partner and I just finally break. I tell them all about my experiences, about how this feels right and that this is who I am. I trusted him, but I was still mortified. His family is Islamic and at the time so was he.

Imagine my surprise when I read the words (paraphrased, because years ago) ""I'm like that too."" It was baffling. He stopped responding for a few minutes and I just stood there in the shower confused thinking he was just trying to be sympathetic or relatable. Turns out I gave him an existential crisis because he felt that way his whole life but never realized it and just thought he was weird!!

So me coming out to my partner ended up with him finding out that he is genderfluid too! Now I have a beautifully handsome pansexual partner who accepts me in all of my forms and preferences (I'm abrosexual). I don't know how we could have lucked out so immensely, but I thought I'd fill your lives with a little bit of happy fluff since a lot of coming out stories aren't the best (like me coming out to my mom who just ended up complaining about her lesbian ex-best friend).

So basically yes, I want to change my whole life and live as a woman. I'm MtF trans and finally, I can love myself.

Previously, a bit more than a year ago, I came out as genderfluid. That was a great improvement because finally, I could start getting familiar with my suppressed femme side. A year passed and I felt depressed again.  To keep it short, I finally put aside all my fears and face the fact, I hate myself and I'm only happy when I can act like a female. This changed my life and the whole perception of my life.

I cried a lot, I scared what will come and how can I face all of these difficulties. I was closeted genderfluid, only my fianc√©e knew. I was so scared while I identified myself as genderfluid by being trans. I feared what my family will think, what my fianc√©e will do, how I can afford all of this...

Now, I'm happier than ever. I'm on my journey to free myself, looking forward to my HRT.

So I'm only very recently realizing that I think I might be gender fluid.

2020-03-21 05:00:06,fm9qah,3,1,"Hi. New here. Kinda trying to figure out my gender identity, or at least how to talk about it. I'm gay (AMAB), and I've been out for years, so I know to hold labels loosely and whatever. So I'm not asking for people to *tell* me who I am. But I am trying to work out (a) what labels are the most useful ways of understanding and, especially, *communicating* who I am, and (b) the surrounding ... etiquette, I guess. So I'd appreciate some outside perspective.

I'd describe myself as male identifying, at least mostly. Thing is, last year, I finally pieced together that I wish I had both male and female genitals, and that while I'm pretty comfortable in a male identity, I do sometimes feel more like a mixture: predominantly male but somewhat fluid. I did a little bit of research and found the term *salmacian --* referring to a myth where a nymph named Salmacis merged bodies with her (male) lover and thus wound up with two sets of genitals -- which seemed to sum things up pretty nicely. Problem is, no one knows the word. (I'd probably have used the word *hermaphroditic* myself, but unfortunately that's gotten The Discourse (tm) slopped all over it, so, no, not doing that.) I'm also comfortable in a male social role, albeit a gay male social role which has somewhat different ""rules"" (especially around genderbending), and prefer male pronouns.

So -- the crude way of asking my two-part question would be, do I *count* as nonbinary? Like, I get that identity isn't just about being oppressed and stuff; but still, I'd feel embarrassed saying anything along the lines of ""\[cough\] Well, AS A NONBINARY PERSON, you IGNORAMI"" to cishets, when my identity doesn't really ""cost"" me anything, and likely wouldn't even if I came out, considering my social and pronoun preferences. And my experience of dysphoria over not having a vagina or a womb, though it spikes occasionally, is fairly minimal in my day-to-day life. (Also, sub-question coming from a place of mere ignorance: given that I'm perfectly happy with having a penis and just wish I had a vagina too, is that even dysphoria? Is there some other word I should be using?) And to cap it all off, I don't really feel much need to come out as nonbinary to anybody outside my writers' group, who already know (two of them had already come out as binary trans, one of each, so I already knew it was a welcoming environment); unless it would be good to come out as nonbinary to, like ... help ... something? Like, raise awareness of nonbinary people (good Lord that might be the whitest sentence I've ever written), I guess?

TL;DR: I wish I had both sets of genitals sometimes, so I feel I'm likely nonbinary, but I'm not sure what to call it or whether to call it anything, especially since I'm socially male. ...

I am a 31 y/o male, and all through my life I have been curious about wearing clothes from the opposite gender. My family is the straight forward ""male is male, female is female"" and not all for being who you are, so all I had was male clothes. As I would pass the girl section I always thought, ""I wish I could wear that, it looks cute."" As time went on it became more and more heavy on my mind. 

Fast forward many years, and I buy my first pair of leggings, and I fell in love. Comfy, warm, snuggly, and liked the way they looked. I most recently got the courage to buy a bra and some underwear, and actually felt real good in it. Now, I'm not confident enough to take any pics, but in due time I know I will. I have a friend who I just recently told, and she is 100% behind me and said she got me some stuff, like some fleece leggings (she says they are the best) and I am excited actually. 

Sorry if this is a read, but I felt like I needed to tell some people, and felt like this is the best place to. It feels good spilling it. I just worry how my family will take it, for me, family is a huge deal. For now, I wear it on my own time when I am by myself. I guess currently I am embarrassed of it because of what I have been told my entire life. I applaud all of you for being yourselves and having the confidence to be who you are, I can't wait until I am at your level. I just want you all to know you all rock it.

I am a non-binary fashion stylist and I'm working on a project to develop a workshop-style curriculum to help people working to explore their gender identity with the help of fashion and beauty professionals. If you've got time, I welcome any willing participants to take this survey! [https://forms.gle/4PvXiHgcRmEjcskU7](https://forms.gle/4PvXiHgcRmEjcskU7)

The answers from this survey will be analyzed to design resources and provide information for trans, non-binary, gender non-conforming, etc., individuals, to provide safe access to community-oriented support of gender exploration and expression processes, through free workshops (and hopefully someday a clothing bank) led by fashion and cosmetology professionals geared toward self-affirmation and empowerment through external signaling and presentation.

The aim is to be able to educate, inform, and demonstrate how a person may explore their gender with reference to their own proportion, features, desired state of being, etc. Some will want to stand out, some will want to blend in, some will want to appear more masculine, some for feminine, some without gender and some fluctuating in between.

We want ALL of those people to be welcome and take away helpful information.

I will preface this by saying, much of this may feel redundant. I encourage you to answer as many questions as you are able, with as much detail as possible. The questions are intentionally broad, there are no wrong answers and no required answers. If you're well along your journey to complete gender confirmation, but happen to be taking this survey, please impart your experiences both past and present.

Please be as specific and candid as you are able, if that includes indicating your ethnicity, physical characteristics, transition status, etc., please provide whatever information you feel comfortable sharing that may be relevant to your experiences.

**Your email address will be collected, but not used for any purpose other than receipt of your response.** They are being collected in hopes of deterring negative responses and tracking abusive respondents if needed. You will not be put on a mailing list of any sort.

So, I came out to pretty much everyone, including my grandmother, as pansexual a few weeks ago. I have also come out to some of my closer friends as genderfluid (AMAB) (I'm not certain exactly where I fit here, I usually settle somewhere non-binary, but with fluctuations between male and demi-girl). All people involved in both of these were supportive and amazing. Pretty much the only people I haven't told, however, are my parents.

My parents aren't homophobic, as far as I can tell, but they seem to misunderstand the concept of gender. I don't think they'd be phased by me being pan (though they may not see the differences to bisexuality), but revealing my genderfluidity seems more daunting. I've set myself semi-deadlines (semi because quarantine) for both, so I can't back out. The way I've done this is that some friends are going to take me shopping for some more feminine/androgynous expressing outfits once this situation dies down, and my parents will definitely question that (genderfluid deadline), and also the fact that I'll be bringing a boy to my senior prom (pan deadline).

With all of the pretext out of the way, what are some suggestions you guys may have about how I could come out to my parents? I kind of want to come out about both at once.

Hello! My colleagues and I are conducting a study on trans people‚Äôs experiences of gender distress and/or dysphoria that takes approximately 30 minutes to complete. If you complete the online survey, you can enter to win a $20 Amazon giftcard. For more info about the study, including a link to the survey, please see below:

**Participant Recruitment Post**

We are a research team of faculty and graduate students at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL), and we are interested in improving research in trans health and well-being by studying a salient aspect of many trans people‚Äôs lives: gender distress and/or dysphoria. We encourage all trans and gender non-conforming individuals to participate in this online study. We hope that this study will contribute to the understanding of the health and well-being of trans and gender nonconforming individuals. Your participation is essential to achieving this goal, so we hope that you will take part in our online survey study. 


**In order to participate, you must:**

* Identify as trans or gender nonconforming

* Be at least the age of majority in the state in which you reside (19 years old if you reside in NE, AL, or ME; 21 if you reside in MS; 18 in other states) 

* Reside in the United States 


If you would like to participate in our study, you may click this link: https://unleducation.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cDgmvVeUFb5yDBP

If you would like to enter to **win a $20 Amazon gift-card,** at the end of the survey, you can click a link to a separate Qualtrics survey where you enter your name and email address. For every 15 participants who complete the survey and enter the gift-card lottery, we will randomly choose 1 participant to receive a $20 Amazon gift-card (you have a 1/15 chance of winning a gift-card). Name and email address information provided will not be connected to your original survey results. Participants who win a gift-card will be notified through email and emailed the Amazon gift-card to the email address provided. Name and email information will be stored in the UNL Box Research Data Storage folder system which has special security settings to further secure the data from unauthorized access. Contact information will be deleted at study completion or by January 2022.

Your responses are anonymous and your data will be removed from Qualtrics servers soon after you complete the study. Depending on your privacy settings, the Internet host you are using may track and save user actions. For example, social networking sites may record and maintain information about the sites and pages visited and links activated while within network. It is possible that they may use that information, linked to your identity, for marketing purposes or provide it to third parties. You may access the survey outside of a social networking site by cutting and pasting the link above into a new web page.  If you have any questions about this study, please feel free to contact us using the contact information listed below. A list of local and national resources will appear at the end of the survey for anyone interested in additional support. This research study has been approved by the UNL Institutional Review Board.
