2020-10-02 06:20:31,j3pie9,3,1,"It's a week since I came out as gender fluid, and I've continued to do a lot of self reflection (potential introspective boredom warning...I'll try to keep it more broadly relevant!). I feel like I've had a middle of the night revelation, and wonder if anyone else feels this way too?

First off though, this has been an amazing week from a coming out point of view, but also bloody awful. My lovely wife had a positive covid test,  and has been grotty and isolating in one room all week. Thank goodness she seems to be over the worst of it and looks to be on the road to a speedy recovery. Her health is number one, but it feels so awful that we just reconnected again as soul mates, and then have been ripped apart. By the by I also have a premier league disability which makes catching the virus myself a particularly bad idea. What will be will be, but of course that thought adds a little spice to the chilli for both of us.

But in that context, the brain carries on its work, so here is my revelation. I've been thinking about my gender in three parts....the body, the mind and the spirit. I define the mind as patterns of thought and behaviour, and the spirit as that indefinable essence which makes you, you. Your core character, which influences the relationship between  your mind and body. I've come to feel they can each have a sense of gender. For me, I have a male body, and I'm pretty comfortable with that (apart from the hair). I have a male dominated mind, not least from 50 years of navigating the world in this big old male body, and again I'm ok with that. But I also feel I have a totally female spirit, right at the core of me. And it's this balance and tension that is at the heart of my being genderfluid, and which explains some of my feelings this week.

I talk about a male and female mind / spirit. I dont btw mean stereotypical male or female attributes. Any male quality can also be a female quality and vice versa. It's just my own subjective sense, but you will have your own sense of things which feel 'male' or 'female' to you. For much of my life my female spirit has been neglected,  sidelined. She has sometimes fought to get out, but she has always  been outnumbered and put back in her place. Often with a flea in her ear and a string of insults. ""Don't come back round here with that crazy talk!"" However,  she is such an important part of me, and by coming out I am starting to give her the recognition,  attention....and credit she deserves. I wouldn't be the same person at all without her.

I have been getting into smaller expressions. A subtle daily eye look, painted nails, a blouse that nobody is around to see. I wondered why these things felt so important to me, then I realised. It's me allowing my female spirit to exist. It's me saying, it's ok, I know you're in there, you're not forgotten. There is some small outward manifestation that is a reminder to me and people around me that I am made of a mix of three parts. It's also a reminder that my female spirit will never again be put under lock and key. She doesn't want to take over (in fact, she can't), but she needs to be allowed to exist. My mind and body have had a pretty good thing going on, and now it's time for them to share nice! Managing that good sharing is going to be the pattern of the rest of my life.

That revelation really helped me, i hope it might be useful to someone else. Does anyone else feel anything like this?

In the meantime I am counting down the days till my wife can come out of isolation. I hope you won't mind me asking for a few extra good vibes.

I never needed to listen to that nasty fearful voice in my head ‚Äúyou‚Äôre too feminine, too masculine, too this, too that.‚Äù \n\nI‚Äôm scared because I have no friends right now but I‚Äôm committed to finding myself and hopefully community too (despite COVID) because that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve ever wanted in life is connection to myself and others.\n\nThanks for reading, I‚Äôm just happy &amp; scared as hell at the same time.', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'Being yourself is scary after childhood bullying but I know it‚Äôs the only way to heal', 'created': 1601732071.0}"

It is the most blatantly biased thing I've ever seen.

The study consists of interviewing an unspecified number of people. An unspecified percentage of the interviewees will be therapists and psychiatrists who practice conversion therapy. Allowing practitioners to partake in this is extremely biased and unethical.

Anybody who is willing to help me with this, you can message your story to me here on reddit or email it to ban.ct.petition@gmail.com or if there is another method you are more comfortable with, I'll see if I can make it happen. Everyone will remain anonymous.


I need as many eyes to see this as possible. I need as many responses as possible. I want these fuckers to feel the hurt and pain that they are causing. Who knows, if I can get enough support from within my state and from elsewhere, maybe I can convince my ""baby trump"" governor to ban it with an executive order.

I can't do anything

I couldn't come out for a long time even though I KNEW my parents would be supportive

I wouldn't DARE present the slightest bit feminine.

I would never do anything.

At first I thought it was just my personality. But it really didn't seem right.

I felt like I was faking everything. I felt like I was just pretending to be gender fluid despite every sign in my whole life pointing to ""I am definitely not cis"".

Then everyone started coming out.

I was supportive but now I felt like an outcast in my friend group even though I was not.

The requirement for dysphoria in the non-cis community didn't help.

I would think, ""I don't have dysphoria. I am just an outcast."" I understand that most everyone in the community had dysphoria. I just didn't. I still knew I was not cis. It just felt like I didn't belong.

Later while browsing reddit, I came across a meme that was talking about this thing called Impostor Syndrome. And it really clicked. I looked up all the symptoms and I was just like ""Check, Check, Check..."" 

But then here comes the problem. I have never had any sort of mental problems. Then I probably did the most Imposter Syndrome thing ever. I thought, ""I don't have Impostor Syndrome! I am just faking it!""

I still don't want to see a therapist

I'm AFAB and there are days that I feel very much like a woman, but there are days that I don't think I feel very attached to my gender, days don't feel really gendered at all, or days where I feel a bit like a man. I asked my partner if he's ever felt like a woman before and he said ""no"".

I guess I never realized that people didn't feel the same way as me in this regard. I've only really been considering how I feel about my gender lately and how I might feel different from other people because I also recently (in the past couple years) realized that I am asexual. I never considered how my experience was different from others by not feeling sexual attraction, so now I'm looking into other ways that my experiences might be different from other people in ways I didn't realize or really think about. 

Growing up I really wanted to be a boy (I think this was more internalized misogyny than any kind of dysphoria, but I could have been a little bit of both), but I eventually found comfort in my skin and enjoy my body. In a lot of my artwork (and even D&amp;D characters) I find I present myself as male fairly frequently. In my drawings I think I default to drawing myself as female even if I'm not feeling very attached because of expectations on me and my gender. 

I don't feel dysphoria when I'm feeling less than female, and might still wear a dress if I was feeling masc. I don't know if I would change my pronouns because I don't really care either way - but maybe I'll change my mind as I explore this more? I could have internalized cisnormativity (is that a word?) in my gender presentation that I need to unravel. It's a weird time.

It all started with a dream one night early last year. I dreamed of being dressed femininely and really liking it. Ever since then I struggled with my identity, wondering why I loved things like dresses, skirts, and colorful tights, as well as other things considered ""feminine."" I even thought for some time that those likes were some kink I had. Well, through the help of a therapist, I have learned to accept myself as genderfluid. I'm not out to many people yet and I don't plan on ever being out to very many people, though.

I should mention that I am a Christian as well. So, if anyone on here is a person of faith also struggling with gender identity, feel free to chat with me! :) I know the journey as an LGBTQ+ Christian can feel a little lonely at times.

I dreamed of being dressed femininely and really liking it. Ever since then I struggled with my identity, wondering why I loved things like dresses, skirts, and colorful tights, as well as other things considered ""feminine."" I even thought for some time that those likes were some kink I had. Well, through the help of a therapist, I have learned to accept myself as genderfluid. I\'m not out to many people yet and I don\'t plan on ever being out to very many people, though.\n\nI should mention that I am a Christian as well. So, if anyone on here is a person of faith also struggling with gender identity, feel free to chat with me! :) I know the journey as an LGBTQ+ Christian can feel a little lonely at times.\n\nI look forward to getting to know people on here! There may be things I ask as I go along, as well as hopefully be of support to all you wonderful people!

It didn't go well.  Not so much that I kept in the closet (understandable), but that it was just incompatible with our family life and she could not accept me as female.  She wants me as a masculine male which is how I look even if it's not how I feel, and wanted me to be a dad to my son, who she feared would be bullied at school because of me.

I said if she could not accept me wearing female clothing in her presence, I could just dress up when everyone was away - no real comment on that.  I told her that I wanted to tell her as I did not want to be sneaky behind her back, should this be cheating.  Ultimately, I'm not in a stage where I want to leave the front door in women's clothing, I'd really just be happy wearing those clothes in the privacy of the house, working on the computer or chilling in front of the TV at home.

She feels that anything trans/gender related is more for the younger generation with tolerant parent and not for a 42 year old with kids - I so wish that these resources were around when I was younger.

I was shaking with nerves and I think she was taking it in with shock.  I think a lot more could have been said an explained, but we're both now awkward about it.

2020-10-08 06:43:43,j78ar9,12,1,"Let me attempt to explain, I‚Äôll keep it as short and sweet as possible:

I am a male. I was born male, I identify as male, everyone who knows me in real life knows me as a male, but I have what I like to call a ‚Äúfeminine side‚Äù. Anyone can have a sensitive side, but personally, I use the term ‚Äúfeminine side‚Äù much more literally. This is a side of me that desires to look like a cute girl on the outside, only on the outside. This side of me is not a separate person, but I do feel like this side of me is female. When I talk about my fem side in the third person, I use female pronouns. But when I‚Äôm dressed up expressing my fem side, I don‚Äôt feel female. The reason I feel this way is because I don‚Äôt feel like I have ‚Äútransformed‚Äù into a girl. I don‚Äôt feel like there‚Äôs a change in identity or personality when I go from looking like a short haired guy wearing jeans and a hoodie, to looking like a long haired girl wearing a skirt and a sweater. While it does make me feel far less masculine and far more beautiful, there‚Äôs still no denying to myself that I am always the same person underneath it all, no matter what I‚Äôm wearing. My fem side is not a person, place, or thing, but an idea that gives my male side the opportunity to step out of the masculine bubble for a bit. It is not a sexual fetish, nor is it my desire to physically and anatomically become a woman. The only thing she desires is to let her have some time out in the world after I‚Äôve kept her suppressed inside of me for so long. She is a part of who I am, but who I am overall is not her. It goes only one direction, not in the other direction. I‚Äôm sorry if that all sounds confusing, but I did the best I could in explaining it.

TL;DR: I have personified an extension of my overall male self, which I call my feminine side, as a female, as a way of expressing myself, and to tell myself that it‚Äôs okay to not always ‚Äúbe a man‚Äù like we are expected to in our patriarchal society.

This past amount of questioning I had was the strongest ever and so I decided to not give up again and do my best to understand my own gender and feelings. This originally led me to think I was a trans woman and I felt that way for a while. I got a therapist and enjoyed my transitioning through experimentation into my feminine side but then I came out to my mom who was very supportive and then the next day out of nowhere my feelings took a 180. This was what caused me to give up before because my feminine feelings turned into neutral or even slightly masculine feelings and I thought I wasn't trans after all.

I have some questions regarding being genderfluid though and what I should do about it if anyone here can help me out. 

1) I already came out to my closest friends and my mom about being a trans woman and now I feel embarassed to tell them I made a mistake. What do you all think would be the best way to tell them I am genderfluid if I feel like this really is how I truly feel? How do I describe being genderfluid to somebody who has little to no idea about things related transgender/non-binary.  

2) I still want to feel and look feminine despite even sometimes feeling a little masculine and am still considering hormones for this reason. Has anyone taken a full dose and felt better or do those of you who take it feel better only on small doses? I like the idea of having breasts but I fear for the days I might not always want to have them.

3) How do others handle you being genderfluid? I'm not going to ask others to call me something different all the time and any pronoun is fine to me but do some of you feel any better with a specific pronoun over others?

2020-10-10 21:57:03,j8t7d1,4,1,"Over my self-realization journey, I‚Äôve come to see that I am simply myself. Myself is an AMAB cis-male, with a feminine side. All guys have one, mine is just more literal than emotional. My fem side, who is not a separate person or identity, is the personification of a desire to step outside of the masculine bubble that the world forces me in through no fault of my own, and feel pretty and feminine. Since I‚Äôve personified it, I felt it was appropriate to give her human pronouns. But make no mistake, she is me, but I am not her. That is a one way street, where I may have the appearance of a girl on the outside, with long hair and cute clothes that men would never be allowed to wear, but I never lose my sense of identity. Call me a crossdresser, a femboy, whatever, I am no different of a person whether I‚Äôm wearing a hat, baggy jeans, and a hoodie, or a wig, skirt, and a sweater. I‚Äôm comfortable accepting that this part of me is female, but she is never who I become overall. Other people may switch emotionally and sexually between male and female, which is pretty much what gender fluidity is. When it comes to me, I‚Äôm just a guy who looks pretty with a wig and a skirt. Never do I believe that she has taken over my personality or identity.

Now with that out of the way, there is no denying to myself that my fem side is not a male personification. I bring her as close to life as I can by transforming my average male appearance to align with her female appearance. When the clothes come off, it‚Äôs still the same person underneath, inside and out. But here‚Äôs the kicker: not everyone will understand me.

Don‚Äôt worry about the subreddit or where it‚Äôs posted, imagine someone handing you their phone and showing you this person without telling you anything about them. What do you see?

It‚Äôs human nature to make snap judgments about people that we see, even if we don‚Äôt know them. We say we don‚Äôt, but we all do. The human brain hates things it can‚Äôt understand, so it will automatically break things down into its simplest form so it can easily understand. From an outsiders perspective, who does not use Reddit and is not as open-minded about gender and identity as most of us here, they see a girl taking pictures of herself in the mirror. The face is obstructed, but in this case it‚Äôs not needed. The long hair, the feminine attire and poses, the human brain is trained to know that either A. This is a girl, or B. This can‚Äôt be a guy. In either case, a snap judgment will be that the person viewing these photos with no context or any other outside information concludes that they are viewing a female. They don‚Äôt know the true person underneath the obstructed face, what their identity is, or anything other than this snapshot of who they are in this picture. If you or anyone else perceived me to be female, I will accept that. It does not change who I am or how I perceive myself on the inside, and I have no right to tell you to change your perception of me, just like you have no right to tell me that my perception of myself is wrong. Which /finally/ brings me to my initial question: Is it wrong for someone like me to accept female pronouns or anything similar, when internally I know that I don‚Äôt identify as female? Is it only okay for me to be okay with being called a girl, or having she/her pronouns directed at me, if and only if I identify in some way or another as female? I am okay with what ever YOU want to identify me as. If YOU want to send me a message saying ‚Äúhey, girl!‚Äù, or leave a comment under my post saying ‚Äúshe‚Äôs so pretty!‚Äù, I am more than fine with that. I am fine with the world defining me as whatever it wants to define me as. I will not argue with you to convince you that I am in fact not a female, I will take it as a very flattering compliment.

2020-10-11 23:07:33,j9fknp,3,1,"Hey everyone!  Names Johnny (born male)
So I'm New here, not really sure if this is the place for me. But regardless of weather I belong or not i LOVE seeing all of your stories in here.

Im just, tbh, still kinda unsure what gender fluid means I only came to the idea about a year ago after doing some basic research trying to understand myself more but didn't really look into it past that. Maybe someone can help me here. 

So basically, where should I begin ü§î, 

Sexuality wise. I have always said bi. Well bi curious at first. Which I guess is good because it helped me explore a bit, even if in secret. I told a couple of friends (mainly female knew deep down that guys at least at the time were less understanding of things.) And that offered a little high. But it wasn't what I needed.)I eventually told my sister, and she was very kind of accepting. She didn't push me away or anything but she didn't wanna talk about it. Atleast not with me
 I found out later that she had talked with a pen pal about it this all took place.duringnmy freshman year of highschool BTW. (16 years ago, I was 15) Anyway. I found out my sister told her pen pal, how might you ask? My mother. Who apparently read my sisters mail, which means my mom knew I was bi curious. What she did in her infinite wisdom and grade a parenting skills was corner me ik the kitchen to ask me, and when I didnt wanna talk about it at.tried to leave I was saved backwards and told I had no choice, we had to. So I told her yes I was, not the big supporting coming out story I would have imagined thanks to tv.shows. She wanted to know if I was a top or bottom (not her lingo she can't even remember what cringeworthy words she used) and when I didn't know because I hadn't done anything, she proceeded to tell me that of I was it would be okay. BUT she wanted me to know. That if chose to be that way (because even til this day, she thinks people choose to not be straight) that i would end up with prostate cancer. Because thats just what happens to gay men, she also wanted to say that my  Deceased father of 5 years would not approve.and be very disappointed in me.

That forced me to push down anythoughts and desires I may have had. And honestly probably hurt me in ways I still don't know. It stopped my exploration, not totally but definitely made me.do it all in secret. My first attempts with a guy wouldn't be until I was 18 now, and it was super sketchy Craigslist stuff. But that was bad. I chickened out a few times, and the guy I tried with only cared about getting of, I ended up not enjoying it and leaving not 10 minutes after I arrived because of everything, but I wouldn't try again until college..and much more positive results. 

But even in college. It was all on the Down low. After my experiences I didn't think I could trust my friends to tell them.and show.my true self. I was even asked a few times to which I said no. 

Even to this day, I still do things on the down low. With gay hookup apps and stuff its easier, can still be sketchy for any teens that happen to read this
 Always be sketchy

Now I still go with bi, because its easier. Easier in the sense that I still have no idea. I know.sex wise. When im with a girl I'm still me but sexually I fall into the gener roll of the guy, and when I'm with guys im.a total botom and fall into the gender roll of a girl, I guess. I dunno this is where is starts to get confusing. And this is where I would love everyone's opinions.

It almost feels like I have a second personality in me. And it fights for dominance. It, or rather, SHE wants to be in charge. And no, I don't here voices or anything like that. Just feelings and how I act, because I can see it. I can feel it.

Side thought curse of a jumbled brain I know when I was younger (and I only remember because it happend at a therapy session i was forced to go to to deal with my dads death, I think I was 13) But on a paper with a bunch of questions I was told I had to.answer there was this question, The first
 It was fill in the blank. And it started as ""sometimes I wish"" and my answer was ""I was a girl"" and then that's what she (the therapist) wanted to talk about so we did a little, but I was scared. And she wanted to knownwhy and I didn't have a reason. Just that I felt that way, and I wanted to feel.special that way etc, she decided that I have difficulty dealing with the difference between reality and fantasy. And I wanted to share that story because talking about this now, made me.think about it.  And how I felt. And how any therapist worth her salt woulda been able to see something. 

So back to before that story. ""Because I can see it. I can feel it"" like ill look.at girls and not be thinking damn she's fine. God the things I'd do to her or.man I wanna grab that ass it looks amazing. But rather think. Damn she's meautiful, she's so lucky. I wish I could look like her. I look.at women sometimes as a man with last and desire. And other times I looks with jealously and desire. For a second I thought am I trans? But I put that down quickly. I love women to much as a guy to want to be a girl. But then when that switch slip.and she's fighting for dominance. I love men to much. And I start wishing I was a girl again..shaving my legs and pits, my chest etc. 

I've experimented with crossdressing when I'm feeling like a girl. And its okay. Leggings are comfortable, the underwear isn't awful depending on the kind. But I just look in the mirror and I can't not see a guys body. And then I get depressed and its a whole.cycle. im sure it wouldn't surprise anyone to know I do suffer from severe depression would it. 


But this is me reaching out. Trying to find answers. 
I know this two personality thing may sound confusing. I just don't know how to describe it. One day I'll be me. Feeling like a guy, the next ill just be me, feeling like a girl but the girl side wants to walk her way, and I say that because I catch myself walking different and or talking different. Again, not voices lol. But then on those days if I have work.ornhave to be around people im.forcing myself to walk like a guy or talk like a guy and its horribly exhausting when i work.12 hour shift. 

And then like sometikes my shifts can last a few hours sometimes a few weeks. 

So.what are anyone's thoughts on this. Am I gender fluid? And I something else? Is this normalish or do I need some serious psychological help?

Damn she\'s meautiful, she\'s so lucky. I wish I could look like her. I look.at women sometimes as a man with last and desire. And other times I looks with jealously and desire. For a second I thought am I trans? But I put that down quickly. I love women to much as a guy to want to be a girl. But then when that switch slip.and she\'s fighting for dominance. I love men to much. And I start wishing I was a girl again..shaving my legs and pits, my chest etc. \n\nI\'ve experimented with crossdressing when I\'m feeling like a girl. And its okay. Leggings are comfortable, the underwear isn\'t awful depending on the kind. But I just look in the mirror and I can\'t not see a guys body. And then I get depressed and its a whole.cycle. im sure it wouldn\'t surprise anyone to know I do suffer from severe depression would it. \n\n\nBut this is me reaching out. Trying to find answers. \nI know this two personality thing may sound confusing. I just don\'t know how to describe it. One day I\'ll be me. Feeling like a guy, the next ill just be me, feeling like a girl but the girl side wants to walk her way, and I say that because I catch myself walking different and or talking different. Again, not voices lol. But then on those days if I have work.ornhave to be around people im.forcing myself to walk like a guy or talk like a guy and its horribly exhausting when i work.12 hour shift. \n\nAnd then like sometikes my shifts can last a few hours sometimes a few weeks. \n\nSo.what are anyone\'s thoughts on this. Am I gender fluid? And I something else? Is this normalish or do I need some serious psychological help?\n\n\nSincerely Johnny', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'New here', 'created': 1602482853.0}"

2020-10-12 19:19:05,j9xhzf,2,1,"I‚Äôve recently began experimenting with my gender and being genderfluid. My friends are supportive, but I‚Äôve been having an issue updating pronouns. It always feels super awkward and almost embarrassing to individually text or group text people to update pronouns, not to mention I also have executive disfunction because of my adhd. I find it much easier to update my socials, but then I end up leaving people in the dark. 

So I thought up a concept for an app that will ask your pronouns at a set time. When you change pronouns or a name, it will either text the contacts you have registered (you can select certain contacts) or will give a notification to other contacts you register in the app. 

Let‚Äôs just say I‚Äôm currently going by he/him pronouns with the name Percy. Say if I wanted to go by she/her, I would enter the pronouns and my preferred name, let‚Äôs go with Harley. When I update it, it will send a notification to all of your chosen contact‚Äôs phones saying 

‚ÄúHarley, formerly Percy, is now using she/her pronouns instead of he/him pronouns‚Äù

It always feels super awkward and almost embarrassing to individually text or group text people to update pronouns, not to mention I also have executive disfunction because of my adhd. I find it much easier to update my socials, but then I end up leaving people in the dark. \n\nSo I thought up a concept for an app that will ask your pronouns at a set time. When you change pronouns or a name, it will either text the contacts you have registered (you can select certain contacts) or will give a notification to other contacts you register in the app. \n\nLet‚Äôs just say I‚Äôm currently going by he/him pronouns with the name Percy. Say if I wanted to go by she/her, I would enter the pronouns and my preferred name, let‚Äôs go with Harley.

2020-10-14 23:53:23,jbckl6,2,1,"Hi everyone,

This is my first reddit post ever (I joined reddit so I could ask this question!) so pardon me if the post is long or un-reddit-ish.

I am a genderqueer (she/her) person and I've been using the nickname ""Bishop"" for about 6 years now, but only with a few people. I named myself after the comic book character Kate Bishop, but it grew to become an important name for me because I've wanted to convert to Catholicism for 12 years now but I can't commit to it because the laws of the church restrict people like me from being in leadership, and some of their other rules are oppressive as well. (If you happen to be Catholic, please don't feel like I'm judging you for it though!) ""Bishop"" went from a fun comic book nickname to an important way I feel connected to Christianity while (re)claiming a title the Church won't let people like me have. I'm starting to want to introduce myself to more people using this name.

I'm concerned though about the literal Greek translation of Bishop. According to the Etymology Online Dictionary, it comes ""from *episkopos* 'watcher, (spiritual) overseer,' and the combination of  from *epi-* 'over' + *skopos* ""one that watches, one that looks after; a guardian, protector' (from PIE root [**\*spek-**](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*spek-?ref=etymonline_crossreference) 'to observe')"". I love the meaning ""guardian,"" but when I google ""Bishop etymology"" the first thing that pops up is ""overseer"" and I'm really uncomfortable with the racial implications of that as a white person. Although ""Bishop"" seems to have been used originally in terms of government and then in terms of religion, and never about actual slavery overseers, I don't want anyone to see my name and think I called myself after a truly horrific occupation.

I just wanted to ask what people thought of this name, and if it seems problematic. Even though religious bishops and ""overseers"" mean very different things, have different traditions, and don't come from the same language roots, I don't know if the word is still insensitive. It's really important to me that I don't pick a potentially racist name that would hurt/alienate BIPOC.

I grew up in a very... let's just say not a very supportive house hold, so even as a child who didn't feel comfortable in their own skin I wasn't ever able to come out and be myself, I would always have to suppress this part of my being and have to continually put up this masculine persona that I just didn't feel completely comfortable as.

2020-10-16 10:41:43,jc7l9l,0,1,"I identify as bigender, as I consider myself to be both a demimale and a demifemale. Which means I have two gender identities. Identity wise, I pretty much go by my demigirl side though gender expression wise I show my demimale side. It sort of balances between the two. So today I thought that I should just put my demifemale name instead of both my demimale and demifemale name. Mostly since I mainly prefer people calling me by my demifemale name anyways, I figured I take off my demimale name from my Twitter username.

I actually felt dysphoria, since my dysphoria is mostly social. I then immediately put back both of the name. A part of me thinks why I need to have both names on my user if I just prefer people calling me one name? I think it has to do with the fact that although I pretty much mostly like being called my demifemale name, telling people my demimale name online as well fully shows all aspects of my gender identity.

I also want to change my dead name to my demifemale name, but a part of me thinks that by picking my demifemale name, I am neglecting my demimale name. So just having my dead name is kind of a balance, even though I don't like my deadname. I can't have two legal names, so I'm wondering how I should approach this once I change my name.

I like to think when I change my legal name to my demifemale name, I just have to keep in mind that my demimale and is still a part of me and at any time I could tell people my second name once I get to know them better. The fact that I look biologically male makes me feel like I should choose my demimale name over my demifemale name to avoid people being confused each time I tell them my demifemale name. But I feel like my demimale name as a primary name doesn't suit me but is rather secondary and that my demifemale name suits me the most and makes me the happiest.

I had a co-worker who was gay and he and his boyfriend invited me out to the bar for drinks. (maybe they suspected at least something about me) it was a gay bar, which I really didn't have a problem with. It also happened to be drag night. (Which I loved, but would have enjoyed so much more now, or if I was out) so there was a great show, a relaxed atmosphere and generally a fun time. 

And then it happened. This man sent over a drink for me. I was polite, tried to decline on the grounds I wasn't interested in men. But thank you. But he still insisted I have the drink. I know I must have been blushing. Even though I didn't have the slightest interest in being with a man, inside I was exploding as a man found me worthy. I felt beyond girly.

**Seasons of Change**

I saw her in Spring, that's when I felt my heart sing.
Before I could bring myself to speak she was gone in a blink.
Familiar was that warm smile and so similar were her bright eyes.¬†
But for all I looked and she wasn't hidden in any nook.


I felt her hand upon mine in Summer, but I dared not to look upon her.
In fear that I would lose her, I gripped tightly begging her to stay nightly.¬†
Her gentle grip waxed and waned, There was no way I could explain.
She stayed hidden from all eyes, if we were sawn we‚Äôd be despised.¬†


I felt her body in Autumn, it felt as warm as the evening sun.¬†
No longer did I hesitate to embrace her, I could finally face her.¬†
Her smile was shared, and our love was taken and repaired. 
With our fingers laced, we could take anything we faced.¬†


I see her all Winter, in a simple smile and tender gestures.¬†
She is with me in my darkest, even when hope feels its farthest.¬†
I am with her as she Shines, all she has is shared with mine.¬†
We have each other, holding close through the cold weather. 

Changing of the Seasons helped forge my reason.¬†
Our realisation had finally came, We are one in the same. 
She is I and I am her, our fluidity is what I confirm. 
I am myself and I am happy, no one can take that from me.¬†

I‚Äôve been toying with the idea of picking a more gender neutral name for myself, but I feel like nobody will use it.

I have a few plans, and I'd like to hear your thoughts about them.

This is what I've been thinking:

We're gonna go in costumes, and I will go in my Death the Kid c/r/osplay. DTK is a boy, he wears a suit and a wig and I look like a boy when I wear it. I feel like a boy when I wear it. I love that suit. Anyway, I could be like ""I'm in cosplay now, so refer to me in the male pronouns"" and see how they deal with it, or maybe be like ""I love this cosplay. It's so nice when people don't immedetaly assume I'm a girl, since you know me being GENDERFLUID and all~"". I'm ready and can't wait to come out to them, and I will be confident in that suit. 

Now, my frineds. I have one friend, O, (17M) who allready knows. I came out to him recently, and he accepted me:D  He calls me in the female pronouns when the others are present. I could ask him, that when I ask or get asked ""are you dressed like a guy?"" He'll say something like ""are you? I still can't tell"" and when the rest will go ""wait wut?"" I will finally out myself, saying ""oh yeah I'm genderfluid I think you should know that"". I can use him. He's my right wing now. 

Another friend worth mentioning is E. E (17F) and I are best friends since kindergarden. We live really close too. And she... has proven to not be a good secret keeper. Which is a problem because her mom is good friends with MY mom. And if she tells to ANYONE, my mom WILL know. My familiy knows nothing. They're not homophobic but... their additude is this: ""We're totaly cool with gays. Yes. But our daughter? Our daughter is a normal strait"". Sooo I don't want them to know. And I'm scared E will tell her perants because they'll tell mine. 

Which way is the best? I don't know what to do. I can tell O to do whatever, or say things that will make the others go ""wait is this sirious?"" And I could come out. And what if they don't accept me??

third, if you were using she/her pronouns at the moment, but I start telling something that happened in a day that you were using he/him, should I use your current pronouns to talk about you, the pronouns you were using that day, or just go with they/them as neutral pronouns?

Now you can have those sick muscles and clean cut hair, classy beard, broad shoulders, strut your stuff.

See that shirt over there? You *can* wear it. And you'll slay in any outfit you want. Get those ties, show off those heels, treat yourself to something anyone can wear. Sing both parts to your favorite songs, going from masc to fem voice effortlessly on those duets.

I used to think I'm genderfluid for a short time but now I'm confused again.I need someone else's opinion. 
I'm 16 year old boy. Since childhood I have an urge to crossdress and around 4-5 years back I secretly started wearing girls clothes when no one was home.It was really fun every time. But that urge feels like fading away since Feb-March. 
But is it possible it is because of my family around me.Before the lockdown ,i was alone frequently and used to croasdress. And During this lockdown...mostly I'm not alone.But even If I am , I still dont want to crossdress. 
Though I still fantasise about dressing as a girl. But when I try to do it practically ,it becomes boring. And I don't want to.
Mostly I like to look and behave masculine ,playing sports,sweating ,etc. But once in a while I become emotional and think my life as a girl. At that moment I try to be alone (normally also I try to be alone but that moment It goes to a higher level. ). This stage lasts about 2-5 hours once in 1-2 week. Its just an average as that phase is unpredictable.

2020-10-29 18:37:59,jkfufj,1,1,"So some background, I rent a house with this guy who I became friends with at university. I believe I identify as genderfluid (AMAB) though I haven't really spoken with anyone IRL about this, and I am still trying to understand and come to terms with myself. Recently I started to realise that even when I am male I am gender nonconforming, I feel comfortable and enjoy wearing more feminine clothing, I want to do my makeup, I want to do my nails, I wan to potentially present myself in a more feminine manner while still being male.

I have been wearing more dresses and skirts throughout the day, I work from home these days so it is easy for me to do it, but unless I knew my housemate wasn't home I would always change into trousers before leaving my room. But the other day I was wearing a dress and almost left my room with it on, and not because I didn't think about it, but because I did think about it and I wanted to be able to wear what I want in my own home. But in the end I did get changed.

However today I spent the day in a red and black tartan skirt, black tights, and a more feminine top, and when I finished work I went down stairs to put some food in the oven and I didn't get changed. It felt quite liberating, but also a bit nerve-racking, until I realised that my housemate wasn't in. But I put my food in the oven, set a timer and then went back to my room. About 30 minutes later I went downstairs to take my food out of the oven and continue making my meal, this time I was also still in my skirt, but I was less nervous because I though my housemate had gone out. I was slicing some bread when I heard the backdoor unlock, my housemate was home, I was in such a panic I just grabbed my phone and almost ran upstairs, but I realised that he would see me through the window anyway if I did that, so I tried to calm myself, stayed where I was and carried on prepping my food.

He entered the kitchen and greeted me, I'm pretty sure he did a double take, but he didn't say anything about the way I was dressed, he just continued as normal. Now I was thinking maybe he would just leave quickly to his room, but no instead he stood around and had a normal conversation with me about work. I kind of averted my gaze from him and kept my eyes on prepping my food, as I was really anxious, but he just acted completely normal.

As it wasn't brought up, I'm not actually sure what his thoughts are, but since he did act no different from usual, I think this will help with my confidence, at least for wearing what I want around the house, and maybe one day out of the house.
