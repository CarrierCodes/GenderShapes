First off, if this isn't the place for this let me know, I wasn't sure where to post.

I was just reading this [Article](https://etcanada.com/news/652371/cara-delevingne-on-harvey-weinstein-he-told-me-i-couldnt-be-with-a-woman-and-also-be-an-actress/) on Cara Delevingne and it made me very curious.  In particular this part:

&gt; “The thing is with me, I change a lot,” Delevingne adds. “I feel  different all the time. Some days, I feel more womanly. Some days, I  feel more like a man.” 

This blew my mind.  I guess I was viewing gender fluidity through the lens of sexual attraction, ie sometimes attracted to males, sometime to females; and not from the perspective of what that persons mind felt like to themselves on a daily basis.

I guess what I'm wondering is what is that like?  As a cis man I have never had the thought ""oh I feel more masculine than usual"" so its hard to relate.  Is it literally like she says, one day you feel like a woman, the next you don't?

Here are my “signs” of being trans,


For trans :

- Relate to most of the MTF egg memes/bingos

- Relate to most of the experiences of trans women on here

- Have bad depression, maybe related to gender dysphoria?

- On the ""am I trans part 2"" YouTube video I identified w/ 5 of the 7 ""signs"" of gender dysphoria

- I've crossdressed when I've had the chance since I was 17 (now 24).

- at age 14 I found that the phrase ""lesbian in a male body"" (or male lesbian) and the term ""autogynephilia"" and its ""symptoms"" really applied to me. It seemed like I had something that described my confusion for once. 

- age 14-16, would pray to wake up a girl every night (probably would have fit the diagnosis for gender dysphoria at the time), pray for brain transplant machine, want aliens to abduct me and change me to girl, wishing I was put in witness protection so I could get a sex change disguise and was curious about reincarnation

- always having had sexual fantasies as a girl

- took informal online gender tests and got ""female"" a majority of the time, generally excited when I did and disappointed when I didn't 

- fascination by gender bending themes in cartoons (code name kids next door, jimmy neutron, fairly odd parents, etc.), movies (scooby doo, freaky Friday, etc) and online captions

- sometimes choosing female avatars, including female names on some email accounts

- Seeing attractive girls, wanting to be w/ them and imagining being them at same time.

- Maybe felt some jealousy of women, confusing combination of emotions (clocked a transgirl at an airport and felt a mixed bag of emotions including what seemed like attraction, jealousy and others) 

- had lots of dreams in past few years as female, feeling very happy in them, hoping to go back asleep to continue them. Also tried lucid dreaming to try to be female in them.

- feel something missing in chest area at times. It can get annoying, especially when trying to sleep, and I would often use a pillow/blanket to ""fill the missing area"". Not sure if gender related though..  (could it be body dysphoria?)

- Doing tons of things that seem to point to wanting to be trans. I get disappointed if I think I’m cis and a warm fuzzy feeling when I think of being trans. I’ve identified as Genderfluid for awhile but i don’t feel satisfied with it

- Seem to have some body dysphoria. Practically every trait that is masculine (jaw, body hair, chest, nose, etc) I have issues with. 


Against Trans:

I don’t hate or dislike being male.

blastin’ music in traffic

2020-06-08 01:36:06,gypd97,0,1,"So I don't know if this is the right place for this. I really hope it is, but if not and it needs to be deleted, I completely get it. I just have been struggling with this for a long time without really being able to understand what my deal was, and despite being very active in the LGBT community and having trans friends and everything, nothing really clicked until I read something today and...I guess I'm just hoping for some input from people who have a better grasp of who they are than I do. (This isn't my main account, by the way - I'm not ready to talk about this with the people in my life until I have a much better handle on all of this.) Also, sorry if this gets a little rambling - I'm a little hopeful that I might have an explanation for things but I'm also VERY anxious about all this.

I also want to say, before I get into this, that I might phrase things in ways that might be problematic with relation to gender norms (I'm really not sure), but I'm struggling to find the words to express what's happening, so I'm asking that you give me the benefit of the doubt on this because I really don't mean anything by it. I'm just...everything is a whirl and every resource I've seen has been aimed mostly at questioning kids and teenagers and their parents, not at grown ass adults like myself.

So, background - I'm a bisexual woman in her mid-thirties, married to a straight cis guy (who is 100% an ally from everything I've seen, not just to me but to our trans friends), and we have a kid. Yes, I DO have trans friends, but since their experiences have been so different from mine, I don't really feel comfortable talking to them about it, either. Growing up, I didn't really think too much about sex or gender (it was the 90s for the most part, so that distinction wasn't really too clear back then anyway), I just mostly identified as a tomboy. I would wear dresses and makeup and do my nails sometimes, but I was typically more comfortable wearing gender neutral or masculine clothes, and even when I was a kid I tended to play more with the boys doing activities like blocks and stuff rather than anything explicitly masculine or feminine. I do remember when I was coerced into playing house, I usually had to play the husband or the dad (though that also might have had to do with me being tall...idk). ANYWAY.

From around the time of puberty, though, I started to experience some things that I thought were just a normal part of going through it, but it never actually went away and I'm learning third hand might not be as typical as I'd originally thought? Um. 

So first, since this has always been the most jarring and obvious thing that I THOUGHT was completely average but is apparently not, when it comes to sex (I'm not going to be explicit), I do appreciate engaging as I would as a cis woman, both with men and women, the majority of the time. But not always. I'm not really sure how to describe this without getting too inappropriate, but sometimes I definitely do NOT want anything that a cis woman would necessarily want, but rather get what feel like actual biological urges that require parts I do not possess. I have no idea how else to put this, but this has been going on since I was at least 17.  It's not all the time, and it's not like a fetish thing - it comes and goes and I have no control over it. But in those moments...I don't feel like a woman. At all. And I've never actually told any of my partners about it because I didn't want them to think it was a joke or a kink or something. It's definitely neither of those things.

More than that, there have been many times when I've been in social and professional situations and I find myself expecting to be engaged by men as another man. Again, this is hard to describe, but it goes beyond expecting equality in the feminist sense - it's more about different social cues. I find myself dropping my voice and being a bit more...assertive, I guess, is the best way to explain it? and even changing my stance and how I carry myself, expecting them to view me as ""one of them"" as opposed to ""one of the girls."" This is also not consistent, and other times I 100% find myself expecting the opposite. (Again, not in any kind of unequal sense, but just in those subtly different ways.) I still don't wear dresses often, but when I do it's because I feel like it. I don't wear makeup but I consistently do my nails. I don't know if any of that even MATTERS.

Finally (well, not finally, I'm pretty sure there's a lot of little things I'm forgetting), there was my pregnancy. So while I was pregnant, I felt - for the most part - like a pregnant woman. This was exacerbated by the fact that it was a rough one and I was sick for most of it, but even emotionally I felt very feminine and motherly and all that...most of the time. But then there were times when it felt like everything about it was fundamentally...wrong. Not the possibility of having our kid - I don't think I could live without my kid and we definitely wanted one. More...having our kid growing inside my body felt fundamentally unnatural. But even this...I don't know if that was because of a difficult pregnancy or if it was something more than that. My OBGYN at the time said it wasn't all that unusual to feel like I had an invader in my body, but...that wasn't exactly what I was feeling.  

I've started reading up more on non-binary and genderfluid people, and I'm starting to suspect that's what I'm experiencing, but I'm not SURE. It's the first time something made any kind of sense out of all of this, but at the same time, I don't actually know anyone (or don't realize I know anyone) who considers themselves either of those to ask or compare notes with.

2020-06-09 08:28:02,gzj166,1,3,"I'm 23 years old. Up until around a year ago, I always thought of myself as a cisgender female - I never thought for a moment that I could portray myself as anything else and just sucked it up, basically. Parents are super conservative and don't approve of the lgbtiqa+ community at all whatsoever.

At first, I thought that perhaps I was a trans man. But then over time, I realised although I seem to be more masculine, I don't feel as if there's a list of traits that make me a man. Aka its just my values and what I deem important. It's just that I wanted anything but to be seen as female. I'm starting to feel like they/them pronouns also are more comfortable to me as opposed to he/him - I only ever used male pronouns because they/them was uncomfortable and they were the only alternative to female pronouns. As for why they/them pronouns were uncomfortable, it's because of the existence of my alter ego, but that's a story for another day. Because of this, I then felt as if I might be agender, just with trans masculine gender expression.

Recently I realised, much to my alarm, that I don't seem to mind my name even if it's predominantly thought of as feminine. Which yknow, makes it strange for me in struggling to get used to a different name that's more decidedly masculine. At the same time time however, I don't see myself as a female. I loathe makeup because it irritates me, though honestly any product on my skin is enough to annoy me. I despise the roles I've previously thought I had to take in relationships as a female - I dislike being submissive to another person. However as a female, I wouldn't have taken a very dominant role either, I guess it's because of my culture. However acting in such a way always makes me feel intensely uncomfortable - kind of why I'm staying away from relationships. I guess I'd believe in equality in roles in a relationship.

Beyond that, I have values that I'll hold myself to no matter the situation. I try my best to be noble, practise good manners, stuff like that. But to me, I don't see that as conforming to any gender role even if it may be thought of as stereotypically male - especially when the honour component comes into play.

Ever since I felt like I might be a trans male, I've gotten my hair cut really short. Thought it was worth a shot since I only used to ever have it up in a ponytail. And honestly, getting my hair cut that short made me really happy. I also enjoy buying clothes from the mens section as opposed to that of the women's section. I've felt like I would like to transition and take on a ""pretty boy"" look. However, I'm kind of getting cold feet and I'm not sure if this is me being uncertain about my gender identity or if it's something else.

Recently I've had quite a fight with PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome). Yesterday my blood test results came in, showing hormonal imbalance (high free testosterone, 17-OHP and DHEAS) that goes along with my diagnosis.

I might have to take birth control to relieve the symptoms like acne and painful periods. I’ve never had any experience with BC before and it's hard to access a good queer-friendly gyn / endo where I live.

My question might be extremely silly, but - is there any chance my gender / sexual identity can be tied to hormonal imbalance? Would stabilising hormones with BC change the way I feel about myself and my gender?

I'm at a loss and questioning the way I’ve felt for pretty much my whole life. I identify as genderfluid and bi, never once doubted this and thought it's just the way I am. It scares me that there's some chance my identity can be tied to this condition and treating it will alter it or even erase it.

As the title suggests, do I identify as Genderfluid?
I'd like to know this.

 Here's what I've noticed. 

My pronouns flip-flop around the day without me really noticing. 

Whenever I try to look at my chest or any female part (I'm AFAB), when I'm Dysphoric, I look away a lot. 

I have a list of pronouns in my head, and I go through them. The pronuns are She/He/They. Whenever something feels like it doesn't fit, it almost feels suffocating in a way. If it does fit, then that makes me think that I'm that gender.

 But, could I be something else entirely? Bigender? Genderflux? Girlflux? Agender? Pangender?

Oh! Is it also able to identify as a Lesbian if I'm Genderfluid?

 I'd seriously appreciate any help I can get.

Thanks a bunch!

I’ve always felt comfortable calling them he, they, and when they want she, as all those pronouns are who they are and I have no trouble seeing them when they want to be called a boy today or handsome. 

Recently though, we finally had a discussion about myself and my sexual orientation.

Hello everyone, my name is Dakota and I live in Bozeman, Montana. I am 25 and have been here for 6 years and am wrapping up a marketing degree.

The friend group I created for myself out here made it very difficult to come out as gender fluid. Deep down that’s what I want to be. I don’t  know what to do, so I am turning to reddit for advice from you beautiful people. In the next year I am planning to:

- find a marketing job on the west coast (preferably Oregon or Washington)

- find roommates that are lgbt friendly and cultivate a more accepting friend group

- get involved in drag shows

- seek the pursuit of happiness

Please share similar stories, tips, tricks, etc. I am looking forward to hearing from you!

To my mom (version 2)

Hi Mom,

I’m sorry I didn’t call today. It’s not that I’ve been trying to avoid it, but because I’ve been trying to figure out how to bring some things up. I’m pretty sure you, And the entIre faMily can Tell that something Really heAvy has beeN weighing down on me... and honeStly, it’s something that’s weiGhed down on mE for years, decades eveN. But over the past few years, the weight has become harD to bEar, and it’s been something I’ve been tRying to get off My shoulders, especiallY as I’m getting older, aNd our world seems to be getting more And More turbulEnt. That being said, as the weight Increases, crackS begin to show, And everything begins coming ungLued, and I think after a few months of quarantine, unCertainty, and now cIvil unrest, the loAd has become too heavy, and It’s coming Down. 

The prOblem is that I doN’t Think it’s fair to put any of the load on you, or the rest of the family. It’s not because I don’t underestimate the love you all have for me... I promise. You have all put up with a lot from me (especially When I wAs youNger), and have shown me how dearly you all care for me. I have been so blessed by the love, and have been supporTed through Some of my toughest days. I know ReGardless of what happEns, you will all still love me...

But my feaR isn’t that I’m underestimating Your love... my fear is that you may Be Underestimating The weIght of this before taking it on. No, I haven’t done anything criminal, nor have I physically damaged or hurt anyone (nor have I hidden anything from Jamie). But the Weight is still so heAvy that it has eNded families before, Turning parenTs on cHildren, brothers on sIsterS, and cauSing more damage than Imaginable. It’s broken hearts, and enDed lives. It’s alsO created a lot oF Misplaced blamE (“if only I had done This,” Or “it’s my fault”), and I don’t want to causE that... there is nothing you, or anyone in our family who has caused this weight on me... that’s on fair to any of you, and I can’t eXpect that from you or the famIly. But in the eyeS of many, I am a messed up person, who needs To be fixed. But I’ve tried that... both by myself, and through therapy, counseling, and all kinds of things. Instead, I’m at a point where I feel I need to acknowledge it, and be okay with it... I don’t hate it, but know many would. And I don’t want to place that burden on you or anyone in the family. I’m just terrified of what it could cause... I really don’t want to harm any of you with it... so please just bear with me as I figure how to bear this so that doesn’t really happen.

I love you all.

Instead, I’m at a point where I feel I need to acknowledge it, and be okay with it... I don’t hate it, but know many would. And I don’t want to place that burden on you or anyone in the family. I’m just terrified of what it could cause... I really don’t want to harm any of you with it... so please just bear with me as I figure how to bear this so that doesn’t really happen.\n\nI love you all.\n\n(Deadname)', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'Please talk me out of coming out to my mom...', 'created': 1592148759.0}"

First i may present myself : I am a 19yo human being born with a vagina, and am indeed genderfluid. 
I've found myself genderfluid aproximatly 3 years ago when i started to think that i would really like to be a boy, but being a girl is also pretty neet. And as i developed my ""feminine"" side, my parents not being very tolerant, i have a lot of girl clothes and long hair, and obviously not so many shirts and tie, even less a binder. 
But now, when i tell someone that i want to express as a guy, they tell me that my hair are a problem. 
Well, i love my hair, i like to braid them and do vintage hairstyle. Sooo, as you may see, it is quite difficult to be ""masculine"" in my skin, which is killing me bc when i want to go out in my man day i just find myself ungly bc of my woman outfit and really don't feel comfortable..

So here's my question(s) : How can i express myself more in my masculine side, when im dead poor and can't ask parents to lend me money to buy binders or men clothes ? Do i need to have short hair to be recognized as genderfluid ? Or can i be a guy with long hair ?? Do i need to be as much as inbetween and not totally a girl and totally a guy ?

2020-06-16 00:53:06,h9t0c5,7,1,"Hello beautiful people! Scrolling through this sub for only a few minutes has made my heart feel so happy. Thank you for that. 
After years of trying to figure myself out and land on a gender, I’ve finally found my home as a genderfluid enby. 💗 I’m AFAB and thought for a couple years I might be a trans man, but always ended up falling back on feeling like a woman every so often. It was incredibly frustrating, and you can tell by how many posts I have in my history about gender confusion and dysphoria. Many people have gently told me I might be genderfluid, and after opening my heart to that advice, I’ve found they were completely right. My gender isn’t fake or made up, it’s just fluid. While most days I’m a man, there are many days I feel much more like a woman, and also days where I’m both (or none). I feel so at peace knowing I’m not the only person out there like this, and that there’s nothing wrong with me for having a fluid gender.
After that long introduction, I have a few questions. There aren’t as many resources out there for genderfluidity as there are for FTMs, so I decided to come here and ask. 
For one, how do you decide on a name for yourself? The name I gave myself about a year ago is Mitch, and while I love it on my boy days, it doesn’t fit my girl days at all, so I’m not sure what to do. Is it ok to have two names? Or should I seek out a name that fits me all the time? Another question I have involves transitioning. I feel very dysphoric sometimes, but on my girl days I don’t feel it at all. Therefore, I don’t want to go through any surgeries or get on hormones, but I know when I feel more masculine I’d like to look it, too. I’m lucky enough to have naturally boyish features and a low alto voice, but is there more I can do that isn’t permanent? I know all about binding &amp; I’ve heard of some transmasculine people using beard dye to make their facial hair more noticeable. Does anyone have any other tips for me on that subject? Also, is there a term in the community for what your significant other can refer to you as? I’m single now, but I’m curious for the future. Would I just be a boyfriend or girlfriend depending on the day, or has some creative person come up with a gender neutral alternative that works all the time? One more question - are there any YouTubers or Instagram people or internet celebs in general (or actual celebs) who are genderfluid that you’d recommend me checking out? I’d love to see more people like me on my social media feeds. It’s nice to not feel alone in this crazy world.

2020-06-16 14:55:52,ha5jpv,4,1,"hi everyone, sorry i don’t know the rules to this sub but i’ve had a lot on my mind and wanted to have a place to talk it out. this might be long. 

recently i’ve (16 years old, female at birth) been going through a pretty severe gender identity crisis after years of thinking i was actually either a cis girl or genderqueer in the sense that i just saw myself as a person and didn’t care about gender, but recently i’ve been thinking about being trans as in a boy or masculine. ive always had questions surrounding my gender ever since i could remember and i’ve always enjoyed being both feminine and masculine at different times. sometimes i’ve looked at boys and wished i could be like them, either in the way they look or act in relation to other people. sometimes ive wished i looked like other girls since i think they’re really pretty. i really enjoy being both feminine and masculine, and i know being genderfluid isn’t just about being girly or neutral or boyish but sometimes i genuinely feel like a girl or a boy or something completely different. when i was in middle school i was introduced to the LGBTQ+ community through tumblr, which anyone who is familiar with tumblr should know that it can be a really toxic place especially when you’re only 11 or 12. i thought of myself as some form of not-cis because i recognized that i had feelings of genuine masculinity sometimes, but because of my thwarted sense of gender and the world i felt really pressured to ‘put on the act’ so to speak. there were moments where i felt super feminine and cis but i tried to ignore them because i thought that would make me “fake” and i only focused on ‘trying’ to be non-binary, and there were moments where i felt masculine or like i wanted to be masculine and was either confused or just thought that that was what being non-binary meant. once in a while i concluded that i was a trans boy, or like i just didn’t care about gender at all. but consistently i’ve noticed that it’s like my natural reaction to any noticeable change in feeling is to suppress it. through the years i’ve mainly just held onto the identity of being a person regardless of gender because i most often either feel like that or a cis girl, so i don’t think about gender too much. 

eventually i became more educated on what gender fluidity is and i thought of it and thought that i could identify as it but i never really stuck with it for some reason. i realize that whenever i am feeling noticeably a certain way, either like a cis girl, or more masculine or like a boy, i tend to try and subconsciously invalidate the moments where i felt like the opposite. right now i feel more masculine so i’m scared that all my moments of femininity were faked and i was lying to myself, and when i felt feminine or cis i genuinely believed that my gender exploration was just a phase and was confused as to why it mattered to me so much. most days i don’t really think about my gender and am fine with being called whatever. does anyone ever feel like they have to prove their identities to themselves? ive been forced to grapple with my internalized transphobia, because the thought of being a trans boy terrified me and still does to a certain extent. i’ve been working for the past month trying to figure out whether my internalized transphobia was just convincing me that i felt feminine and like a girl, or whether i genuinely do. i have a lot of anxiety surrounding this topic because i am super attached to being a girl and even if i wasn’t a girl i still want to hold onto my identity as a girl. i don’t know what this means. ive been contemplating if the reason why i was so desperate to hold onto my non-cis identity when i was younger even when i felt cis was because i understood that it was a part of me, and why i’m so desperate to hold onto my cis identity when i feel trans is because i understand that it is still a part of me. 

body-wise, sometimes i really love the idea of having a male body, and sometimes i think of myself as having like a mix of female and male qualities, and other times i love my current body and wish it was even more feminine. a really interesting thing is that when i think of having a male body, dressing masculine seems fun but so does being specifically a male and presenting femininely. when i think of having a female body, i love the idea of having super high feminine presentation and super high masculine presentation at the same time. other times i think of just presenting myself as plain old cis. once in a while i pose my body to see how it would feel to transition, and having a flat chest makes me happy and comfortable. i distinctly remember having the thought “maybe i’m a boy in a girl’s body,” and thinking that i’m a trans boy. for a second i felt relieved and scared because being a trans boy would offer me a sense of solid identity because other parts of my life are super gray-area, but obviously i would have to work through my internalized transphobia. then i realized i value both being a boy and being a girl, as in i liked not “belonging” in my body. sometimes i think, well, what if i’m just a feminine trans boy? being male and wearing skirts would make me happy. but then i think about all the times i felt cis and a) that my gender exploration was just a phase or b) forced myself to “feel” trans or non-binary. 

i associate identifying with a specific gender at a time with a lot of guilt, confusion, and fear. when i was little and first heard the word transgender on the news, i was scared because i saw the controversy surrounding it and was scared that i identified with it in some form. when i was on tumblr in middle school i felt super pressured to be a certain way and often ignored whenever i felt what i wasn’t “supposed to,” often times feeling guilty because when i felt like a girl i felt like i was just faking not being cis. sometimes i did intentionally fake feeling non-binary because i thought that i needed to or should have been as different as i possibly could be and that being cis was bad, but i was still confused because it felt like my feelings “went away” and then came back. feeling like a boy or non-binary when i felt like i “should/need be trans” felt like a reward and feeling cis felt like a punishment or like being a poser. 

right now i most identify with being a boy even though there are parts of me that are feminine. for the past month i’ve been driving myself crazy, convincing myself that i’ve been lying to myself the whole time and that i’ve been a boy all along. the moments where i genuinely felt like a ‘regular’ cis girl? i just didn’t realize i was trans. me being interested in girly things, identifying specifically with female characters in TV shows and wishing i was them? not valid. moments where i felt like i was faking my own trans-ness or intentionally faked my feelings? not true. when i felt like a girl it was the opposite, just with less anxiety surrounding it. my constantly fluctuating gender identity labels and experimentation in middle school? was just faking it. using she, they, and he pronouns online? just holding onto feelings i used to have, trying to be different again. the moments where  i felt genuine happiness from having an androgynous or masculine feature on accident? just a coincidence. i sometimes feel guilty for saying i use any pronouns because even though whichever specific two may not bother me, i identify with one the most, but which one or two i identify with or if i care at all changes. 

looking back on my life there are specific moments that i can pinpoint where i enjoy being more masculine, for example in the way i used to dress, use body language, or identify with and admire male people and characters and wish i could be one of them. there are also specific moments where i enjoy being more feminine in the way i use body language, dress, and identify with/wish i could be other female people and characters. there are also a lot of moments where i felt really confused because a feeling that i had felt so sure of changed or because i didn’t even know what i feel. but my mind keeps on going back to those questions. what if i was/am faking it? what if those feelings aren’t valid and i’m only a boy who enjoys being masculine and feminine?

logically i think identifying as genderfluid makes the most sense because my feelings seem to fluctuate, and most of the time i don’t really care to do anything about it. i don’t know why right now it seems to be hitting me so hard (i started to question my gender identity again once i went through my middle school phone and read some messages i sent about my identity). but i just struggle with feeling like i’m lying to myself. the idea that i’m actually a trans boy and i’m just suppressing myself terrifies me because i don’t want to be on my death bed and just wish i told myself the truth. sometimes i look at people who have successfully transitioned and feel either jealous or like if i was guaranteed a “successful” transition like i would do it. these moments tend to be memorable. there are also times where i see a trans person and think nothing of it and am not compelled to do any self reflection because i don’t relate. there are also moments where i see a trans or non-binary person and get happy because it feels like i’m reminded of a little piece of myself that i don’t think about a lot. 

if i’m being completely honest, i really just don’t want to think about gender at all. i know there are moments where i feel masculine and moments where i feel feminine and moments where i feel neutral, but i wish i could just do what i want and not care because i hate the cycles of self doubt and fear and invalidation that i put myself through. like i want to just be a person and do what i want and let people call me whatever. if i really, really tried and figured myself out i would probably be happy in the sense that i could actively portray whoever i am, but i’m starting to wonder if it’s okay that i just think, i am whatever i am, and nothing is going to change that, so i should just go on with my life. and then i go, is this a cop out? what if this is just another layer of internalized transphobia? 

i think most of all i’m scared of lying to myself and being unhappy but not addressing it. i know that this is a safe space so i hope it’s okay to say it, but i do not want to be a trans boy. it just really scares me. i have to be honest with myself about that. 

i guess my question is, does anyone else or has anyone else felt the same way? like you have to prove yourself to yourself? or like your lying to yourself based on your fluctuation? what do you think i am? is it okay to just want to not care about it? has anyone who currently identifies as genderfluid thought about being a binary trans person? how do i stop immediately trying to invalidate any feelings i have? how do i stop the constant internal discussion i have in my head about my identity? how do i feel at peace with myself? how do i teach myself/can i believe that feeling one way doesn’t invalidate when i feel like the other?

anytime i feel like i’ve reached some sort of conclusion i go in circles again. when i conclude that i’m not a trans boy? i tell myself i’m lying. when i start to think that maybe i am a trans boy? i start bringing up all the other times that point towards something else. sometimes i try to put myself into a hypothetical situation where no one judges you for being trans, genderfluid, etc and see what i would do. during my current identity crisis i either think of transitioning into a male body or going by male pronouns and being okay with being a trans boy and not feeling as pressured to hold onto my cis and non-binary feelings, but still identifying with them if that makes sense. like the cis and non-binary identities would still be with me/in me, just not right now, i wouldn’t have to care about anything. in an ideal world i’m magically granted superpowers and the ability to shape shift so i could be whoever i want, look however i want, when i want. 

anyways, thank you all for giving me a space to get everything off of my chest. ive had a lot of anxiety about this and i technically have someone i can talk to but expressing my feelings in this format has been super amazing, and i’m happy even if i don’t get all the answers or if this was too long to read. i am so thankful if anyone read to the end, but even just a thought on a specific section of what i said would be helpful, i don’t expect an essay back. who knows maybe there won’t be any response. you are all beautiful, handsome, and attractive human beings. never stop being you.

also, i know a gender therapist would probably be the best option but my mom is apprehensive about discussing gender identity and unfortunately i’m not in a position where i can get even a regular therapist.",genderfluid,please help me figure stuff out (long),1592344552.0,"{'created_utc': 1592319352, 'id': 'ha5jpv', 'num_comments': 4, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'hi everyone, sorry i don’t know the rules to this sub but i’ve had a lot on my mind and wanted to have a place to talk it out. this might be long. \n\nrecently i’ve (16 years old, female at birth) been going through a pretty severe gender identity crisis after years of thinking i was actually either a cis girl or genderqueer in the sense that i just saw myself as a person and didn’t care about gender, but recently i’ve been thinking about being trans as in a boy or masculine. ive always had questions surrounding my gender ever since i could remember and i’ve always enjoyed being both feminine and masculine at different times. sometimes i’ve looked at boys and wished i could be like them, either in the way they look or act in relation to other people. sometimes ive wished i looked like other girls since i think they’re really pretty. i really enjoy being both feminine and masculine, and i know being genderfluid isn’t just about being girly or neutral or boyish but sometimes i genuinely feel like a girl or a boy or something completely different. when i was in middle school i was introduced to the LGBTQ+ community through tumblr, which anyone who is familiar with tumblr should know that it can be a really toxic place especially when you’re only 11 or 12. i thought of myself as some form of not-cis because i recognized that i had feelings of genuine masculinity sometimes, but because of my thwarted sense of gender and the world i felt really pressured to ‘put on the act’ so to speak. there were moments where i felt super feminine and cis but i tried to ignore them because i thought that would make me “fake” and i only focused on ‘trying’ to be non-binary, and there were moments where i felt masculine or like i wanted to be masculine and was either confused or just thought that that was what being non-binary meant. once in a while i concluded that i was a trans boy, or like i just didn’t care about gender at all. but consistently i’ve noticed that it’s like my natural reaction to any noticeable change in feeling is to suppress it. through the years i’ve mainly just held onto the identity of being a person regardless of gender because i most often either feel like that or a cis girl, so i don’t think about gender too much. \n\neventually i became more educated on what gender fluidity is and i thought of it and thought that i could identify as it but i never really stuck with it for some reason. i realize that whenever i am feeling noticeably a certain way, either like a cis girl, or more masculine or like a boy, i tend to try and subconsciously invalidate the moments where i felt like the opposite. right now i feel more masculine so i’m scared that all my moments of femininity were faked and i was lying to myself, and when i felt feminine or cis i genuinely believed that my gender exploration was just a phase and was confused as to why it mattered to me so much. most days i don’t really think about my gender and am fine with being called whatever. does anyone ever feel like they have to prove their identities to themselves?

I'm now 21 living 800 miles away from that hot mess and in a much safer place so lately I've looking and asking around if anyone else has felt this way.

Hi people of genderfluid, I'm confused in my old age. Can you help me.

 I (M58) was married for 20 years, two grown up kids and I have four brothers who are my best friends. I've been  divorced for about 15 years and had a couple of short-term girlfriends since. Anyway, over the past four or five years I have developed an interest in cross dressing and regularly visit trans porn sites. I recently started up a conversation with someone on a sissy site, and after a few months of chatting and sending each other pictures, we arranged to meet up. I was so excited to be meeting someone and having some fun.

Here's the problem.

When the day finally came to meet my internet friend, I didn't go through with it. I had what I can only describe as an existential crisis. I kept thinking about my family,  about our childhoods, memories of growing up, the sports we played, the girls we dated etc. and how it would all suddenly become meaningless to me from the point of view from where I stand in the family set up. The values that we hold as a family, which I have never given much thought have suddenly become manifest and I worry that meeting up with my friend would make me feel absent, detached, separated from the family unit if I were to go through with it.

But I want to. My friend has been very understanding and we are still in touch.

 My family are not religious in any way and I know 100% that they would still accept me if they found out. But the problem is it’s ME who would not feel part of my family anymore. I feel that once I go over to having a same-sex experience I will feel different to the rest of my family.  Like they are all still the same with me but I am detached from them.

Has anyone else been through this kind of dilemma?

Can anyone give me some advice?",genderfluid,Confused about same sex relationship,1592519281.0,"{'created_utc': 1592494081, 'id': 'hbgrgu', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""  \n\nHi people of genderfluid, I'm confused in my old age.

Tonight I felt male and wanted to try flirting with my SO as he felt more male than female tonight. But as I was going along, I began to realize something. It wasn't grabbing me, the way it does most other times. As in, I started to feel a bit uneasy. I can't really explain why, but I do know that as long as I've been male, I've been mostly focused on women. You could say that my male half is straight.

But that doesn't happen at all when I'm anything but male. I'm pretty much pansexual at that point. So, is this a thing anyone has ever heard of? Can different genders in a person have different sexual desires?

I'm trans (MtF), and when I came out to my friend he confided in me that he might also be trans but wasn't sure. We explored it a bit, but soon he was back in (what seemed like) denial, and ""feeling cis"". However, a week or so later, he was back to feeling dysphoric, and ever since then, on a fairly regular basis (about once every week or two) he will flip from feeling comfortable and ""cis"" to uncomfortable and dysphoric. We're both arriving at the conclusion that he might be fluid and slipping between male and female, but he is having a hard time coming to terms with this. The way he sees it, no matter what he will be uncomfortable and dysphoric half the time:

&gt;Me:  
I know it's hard but try your best to see this stuff in a more positive light  
&gt;  
&gt;Him:  
Yeah I'm not sure there is one chief lol  
There's a neutral light  
""This is a thing and you must deal with it""  
&gt;  
&gt;Me:  
And what's the best way of dealing with it? Thinking more positively  
&gt;  
&gt;Him:  
Okay let me try...  Yaaay I'm going to (potentially) feel dysphoric like half of the time with no way to really actually fix it!  That's the best!!!  
Positivity :D 

He also says that being fluid would be at extreme odds with his personality:

&gt;Me:  
Well hey, if fluidity is a thing, it's a very valid thing and I will support you on that lol  
&gt;  
&gt;Him:  
lol  
I just hope it's not a thing  
any kind of non-binary thing is like  
not a great fit for my personality  
lol  
&gt;  
&gt;Me:  
Lol  
Well hey it's not like you have to jump in all at once lol  
You get to choose your own way of presenting that  
Discovering yourself can be fun if you let it  
&gt;  
&gt;Him:  
yeeaaahhh  
nnoooo  
lol  
self discovery implies cHaNgE  
&gt;  
&gt;Me:  
Indeed  
Fear of the unknown is powerful  
Oh no, maybe I won't like this thing that I try  
Or maybe people will think differently of me  
It's powerful shit  
&gt;  
&gt;Him:  
It's more ""oh no what I feel/who I am will be inconsistent""  
that sounds deeply unpleasant

In his current living situation he is unable/unwilling to explore this much further, do much (if any) research, or even seek help from anyone that could help him but me, which is why I felt the need to come here and ask for assistance from you all.

My daughter's friend shave her/they head about two years ago, at the time my kid asked me to cut short her very long hair to support her friend (the kiddo was nearly bullied). 

I'm bi/pan (never bother to put an etiquette on myself) and I've always have made myself open/non judgy about everything. I never disclosured my sexuality but always told to my kids that even if mom or another people was in a samesex relationship it was ok and normal. 

My kids are all the time defending the weakest and defend their rights. This one has strong opinions and protest successfully against many things (females not allowed in football team, fatshaming, pants not allowed for the princess in the play, etc.).

Now her friend opened up about being gay and ""gender fluid""  or ""non binary"". Parents are ok. My daughter has always been sensitive she's very white and passes as a native. I'm not a native from where we live and even if I'm not brown or black, my color and features can't pass as native. So she feels concerned about the racism I endured and the sexism.

My kid told me that she's a girl but sometimes don't feel like it (she was always a Tomboy and I always had gender neutral toys). She told me that sometimes she has crushes on girls even if she's always in love with boys.

Now I told her that I loved her no matter what. But, I explained to her that her private life or love interests are not to be exposed at school. I explained to her that I see sexuality and gender as fluid but many people are still seeing it as binary. So she must be discret and wait to see how it goes and how she feels it in few years.

I explained to her that I don't want people to labbel her. She already has ADHD and had a difficult time with some bullies. 

All that text to say that I fear my kid just is relating too much with her friend. She can be very compassionnate and she's living a stressful time with my complicate divorce. Is it possible she overthink to much? She never liked skirts and her father ex-military always treat her like she was a boy and belittled her when she tried to be feminine. But between being tomboy to gender fluid that's a stretch and never expressed anything in that way.

If she's queer and fluid I don't mind. I just want to listen some other opinions. What made me think about that is that she  asked me if a test exists to test gender and sexual preferences.

so, the common definition of genderfluid is someone who switches between male/neither/both/female (there are other genders, but I'm referring to the standard definition), right? 

but in my case, it's kind of different (¿) 
I switch between feeling more masculine/feminine and most of the time neither or both. NEVER ""boy"" or ""girl"" 100% 

for example:

the gerderfluids I see go ""today is a girl day""

and I go ""hm, I'm feeling more feminine today""

plus, I don't really care about pronouns so I just stick with she/her since I'm biologically female (my first language doesn't have neutral pronouns) and that's what I'm used to, and I don't change my name.

How was your coming out?

How do you express your gender?

How does tour gender affect your relations with others? (Like with pronouns, or whatever comes to mind)

How did you figure out that you were genderfluid?

What does genderfluidity mean to you?

How does one properly represent a genderfluid character in media?

2020-06-22 13:13:31,hds3zt,15,1,"Hey there. My name is Rory Price and I'm a science-fiction writer. I recently started working on a new book with a genderfluid protagonist. I figured I'd ask a few questions here to make sure I get it right and give accurate representation. Any advice is welcome. I have some questions written up, but feel free to ignore any that makes you uncomfortable. You can also private message me if that's more comfortable for you. Just don't use the Reddit chat function, please. It never worked right for me and I ended up just blocking the whole thing with ublock.

Also, keep in mind that I'm currently researching gender fluidity. If I'm using the wrong terminology or I'm getting a concept completely wrong, do let me know. As a writer, I firmly believe that I should push the boundary as to what I'm comfortable writing, but that pushing said boundary should be done in a way that's respectful and inclusive. That also means a lot of research and some trial and error. 

With that said, here are my questions. 

- What pronouns are generally prefered? Do you prefer gender-neutral pronouns, or would you rather use the pronouns associated with the gender you currently idenfity with.

- I've heard terms like ""male day"" or ""female day"". Do you have favored terminology for the act of changing your gender identity? (Switch, transition, etc.)

- How much importance would you place on physical trappings, such as clothes or makeup? Do you consider these things an essential part of your identity, or are they something you can easily cope without?

- If you've been through situation were you were forced to externally identify as your assigned gender, (At work, for example) how much of a toll does it take? Does it naturally push you towards a different gender afterwards, when you're either by yourself or with others who accept you for who you are?

- Do you find that you feel like one gender or the other fits more with certain situations? For example, going outside for a job being more of a female thing while working on your computer being more of a male thing? (Just making up a dumb example here.)

2020-06-25 13:14:31,hflvox,1,1,"So, I'm new here. I've been wondering if maybe my feelings aren't as universal as I always thought.

When I was 14, I first started using the internet. I engaged in a lot of roleplay; Dungeons and Dragons, RP servers on World of Warcraft. I came upon a situation when I was 16 where someone confronted me about someone else, where I had been using female pronouns to refer to a player who had always adopted female characters online.

I never asked if the person on the other side was male or female or something else. Frankly, I always assumed that was none of my business. But this person was insistent that the player was male and I should use he/him pronouns. I gave a response along the lines of, ""I'm not in the habit of tracking who plays what character. I just default to use the pronouns of the character to talk about the writer. Privacy and all.""

I ended up asking the player what they'd prefer and they seemed of the same mind as me, to the point they thought it was cute that I identified them as female and would like me to continue.

I'm 27 now. I still do a lot of roleplay. More and more, characters I play are separating into different gender identities and combinations that make sense to me.

A couple of those characters follow a trend; characters who identify differently based on what role they are playing. A demigod with a mortal form shifting from nonbinary to female. Vigilantes shifting identity based on their alteregos.

And I reflected on how that seems to square with how I feel on the internet. That I feel ""she/her"" when I'm interacting from a ""she/her"" account. That I feel ""they/them"" when I'm interacting from a ""they/them"" account.

And I'm wondering if that means I'm genderfluid. Thing is, there's such a thing as bleed, where you feel affected by what your character would feel. But I can't help but wonder if it's more for me in this case. Or wonder if I'm misattributing my aversive feelings towards some pronouns as being genderfluid when I might simply prefer more anonymity online.

When I'm offline, my gender is somewhat stable, between male and non-binary depending on whether I'm talking privately or on a stage respectively. With a preference for he/him and they/them, but without as much of an aversive feeling I get when I'm online.

Or is all of this simply a fluctuating form of expression?

Hiya! So I hope this all makes sense and maybe some help will come from this post. I am AMAB, and live most of my life (currently almost totally still closeted) in guy mode. I spend the last twoish years trying to figure myself out on my own and it hasn’t really helped just more confused and more questions so figured I’d finally start looking for some advice or friendship of others that may have or are dealing with these types of things. I don’t really consider myself a man or a woman I just don’t think I fit to either really, and while boy mode is fine...I have been more and more wanting to really give my girly side a go! I love the clothes the shoes even makeup the little I’ve learned. I don’t really have a support system, some of my friends won’t care but family and a lot of life will not be so ok with it. I feel super alone most of the time and it sucks! I have a ton of issues with my body and wish I was more Fem but I don’t feel like I’m trans. My therapist (one of maybe 6/7 people tops that knows) said I should reach out online and look for help and advice from others so that’s why I’m here. I’ve been “crossdressing” in private on and off since I was a kid, always been a bit more girly and gotten on better with girls then guys. I’m sorry this post doesn’t have much of a point...basically the title sums it up perfect I’m looking for people willing to talk and help me understand things better or give advice or whatever honestly. So yeah feel free to ask anything or whatever since I didn’t go into a ton of detail if there is anything you wanna know or if you’re willing to chat or whatever. 💜 thanks

2020-06-28 21:12:58,hhmkhk,4,1,"I'm arranging to see a therapist soon and I know that in the end it's up to me to decide what I am, but I'm curious on what other people think, like getting a 2nd opinion.

(Male at birth, started transitioning to female about a year ago)[currently 20 years old]

Since I was around 12 years old I couldn't stop watching body/gender swap anime/cartoon episodes. It was imeadietly addicting and I didn't know why At first. I constantly had dreams of me body/gender swapping, but what was kinda frequent in those dreams was that I had the ability/power to switch between a guy and a girl not just a single change to the opposite gender. and similarly I really got into ranma 1/2.

I used to have a decent beard before starting to transition to female. I did really like how my face looked with my short ""guy"" hair and my beard, but I wasn't very keen on my body or at least not all the time. There were a few genuine times were I felt good about my body when I looked in the mirror, but most of the time i did not feel good about it. That and other things lead me to thinking that I'm probably trans female. 

So I eventually started transitioning (1 year ago). My HRT has been extremely slow compared to the average MTF taking hormones. I've had many ""doubts"" related to my transition keep popping up, I was able to push the doubts away by remembering the reasons why Im transitioning. But more recently ive had 3 ""mini"" mental breakdowns about my gender, what I am, and if what I'm doing is the right choice.

After taking a lot of time to think about it and to reflect on who I am and stuff. I was able to come up with some of these points on how I feel and what started to make me question if I'm gender fluid or possibly non-binary. (Or somewhere in-between)

- I dislike my penis and would likely get vaginolplasty/sex change surgery (would have my legal gender marker be female)

- I for sure dislike my body hair and would continue doing my Lazer hair removal sessions on my body

- I liked my ""guy"" face with the short ""male"" haircut and the full beard.

- I also like my more ""Female presenting face"", where it's no facial hair, short(similar to a bob cut) ""female"" haircut with beach waves

- tried makeup, did not like it.

- I don't like painted nails, fake nails or lip stick/gloss

- I like my female fitted a little above the knee jean shorts

- I like all my female fitted clothing i just feel like i currently don't look good in them.

- I liked all my male fitted clothing, just a good chunk of the time I didn't like how they looked on me.

- I generally dislike my masculine body, like the broad shoulders etc... Especially when I have to see my naked body in the mirror before getting into the shower and in a first person perspective in the shower

- I feel like I can relate to both guys and girls

- I have some ""feminine"" habits/personality traits and most of them were present before even considering anything related to my gender

- but I also have a lot of ""masculine"" habits/personality traits, but a good chunk of those I think come from being raised male, if I was born/raised female I think I'd still have ""masculine"" habits/personality traits but it would be a lot less.

- I sometimes did like my really deep voice, but I also disliked it a lot and was very often envious of some female voices

- in character creation in video games I tend to always gravite towards the ""female"" option, but can still think the male characters sometimes look cool, but would still choose female.

- I'm an artist, and I mostly like to draw ""female"" characters and when I started to draw myself as female I've tend to like it more than the guy drawings of myself, but that part could be more because as I draw more my art gets better, so it could be that I like it more cuz by that point I've gotten better at drawing.

- (unrelated likely) I'm attracted to females, but I have genuine wonder if I can also be attracted to a guy and enjoy a relationship with a guy. So currently I would say I'm bi-curious.

- he/him pronouns don't feel right most of the time, she/her pronouns feel nice but sometimes I feel like I don't deserve them or that the pronouns are a stranger to me. They/them don't feel right either, even tho it can be used singular, to me it feels a little impersonal, like some how he/him &amp; she/her feel more personal to me.

- I do think the idea of being able to use/switch between a ""male passing"" voice and a ""female passing"" voice would be nice.

- (not sure if related) when thinking about myself, I subconsciously tend to think/view myself in the 3rd person perspective

- to me I feel like a female/feminine body can pull off any kind of clothing weither it's masculine, feminine or neither.

I was thinking this morning how it's funny that when I first found GenderCritical, I mistook the ""critical"" part of it to be critical of classic gender expression. I remember thinking to myself ""this gender thing is friggen complicated--can't we just be free to be ourselves?"" I figured there had to be somewhere that was critical of the M, F bingo card. I went looking around in the trans communities, and found a little bit, but mostly just more gender conformity in reverse. I remember for the longest time wanted to strike up a discussion on the GC sub about how this isn't *actually* being critical of gender, but I knew it would get downvoted into oblivion.

There was this one post on GC a few years back that really sticks with me. It was in the ""peak trans"" thread, and was about how the OP saw a huge (6'5""+, athletic) man in a dress, nails done, etc, get on the train. OP was saying how she was all for people doing what makes them happy and didn't really care that he was in a dress, but it was just ridiculous and bothered her because the dress ""didn't suit him."" Somehow the doublespeak of ""I'm for GNC and be yourself"" while obviously being against it bothered me more than someone just being overtly against non-conformity. This was OPs peak trans moment, and one of my peak ""you're not even remotely critical of gender"" moments.

I posted low-key on GC here and there, and I've had a variety of discussions on GCdebatesQT. The latter is predominantly GC, but some people will engage in good faith.  I didn't even know *this* sub existed until today. I mean, I assumed reddit had a place for gender fluidity, but I never would have guessed the type of posts and the overall vibe. I'm happy for those of you who can slide around on the gender expression spectrum and ""pass"" wherever, but the pics that are more personally striking are seeing those of you express yourself how you want/feel *regardless of* passing, and are clearly happy and content with yourselves. That's how it should be. Ironically, that's the real gender deconstruction that I was looking for a couple of years ago--GC just stole the term.

My own gender is complicated. I'm in my 40s now, and gender has been a challenge since I was a little kid. I've gone through extensive bouts of dysphoria and bouts of times where I was just okay. Either way, after 30+ years, I'm finally touching in on a deeper level of self-contentment through acceptance, and it's hugely inspirational to see others being themselves and finding contentment in that too.

Anyway--happy to have found this place. Keep being who you are and happy and proud of yourselves.

So I haven’t even transitioned really (I’ve taken low dose T which has made some minor changes but nothing drastic) and I’m happy with those changes. I agree with what some other detransitioners have said that it’s not useful to think of it in black and white (completely trans or cis) cause I have certainly felt dysphoria. I first realized I might be trans about 2 years ago and if you asked me then I’d say I was sure I was FTM. But lately I’ve been going through some personal growth (Im pretty sure I had sexual trauma in my childhood and I’m just now getting through that) and now I’ve had more cis feelings. But maybe I’m just gender fluid or non binary.

I don’t even fully know why I’m posting this, I’m just very confused and want to see if anyone can relate. I’m just not sure if my cis feelings are just me trying to convince myself out of the hardships of living trans in a cis world.
