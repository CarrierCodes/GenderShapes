Ever since i was fairly youmg ive had those moments where i just.. Really wanted to be a guy? And felt like it would be so much better, but ive never got much thought into it until i got with my ex 


With him ive started exploring those ideas more , eventually got a binder, started more openly switching between more girly and boyish


Tho, after a while ive realised that.. While i do have those days where im much more masculine, there's days where I feel boyish, but feminine.. More often then not actually? Where I'd just want to be this cute boy, but dressing in cute girly clothing? Which made what i felt like truly complicated even more.. Eventually also realized i often felt more masculine but in a more.. Sexual way? 


I slightly gave up on the whole idea, finding it hard and too complicated to keep up for me, but mostly for the people around me, and just stayed with just feminine pronouns. After breaking up with my ex i pretty much just.. Buried it downand never thought much of it again until the holidays when i wore that one shirt that would always make me feel masc.. And it kinda overflew back to me.. 


This all probably feels rambly, and im sorry.. 

TLDR pretty much is, ive been ignoring how i felt gender wise for so long that im not even sure how to tell anymore? Im not sure if being this.. Confused and just an amalgamation of fem/masc girl/boy is normal? I only have 2 people with who i can discuss this fairly honestly.. And both are busy or not very good at words.. 

I think i mostly need reassurance? Sorry if this doesn't reallt belong here?",genderfluid,New here!

What I came up with is this... I am a trans and non-binary gender voice therapist and that is what I know. Everyone is likely in the home with extra time but not a lot of resources. I have decided to deeply discount my services and offer a months worth of voice classes for the price of a single session ($145).

I am opening the class up to anyone who feels like they want to start or continue their voice journey. All gender identities and experience levels welcome. There will be a course once a week for an hour on Saturdays at 12pm Pacific Standard Time. You can learn more through this [link](https://www.sfspeak.com/class) and I'm always happy to answer any and all questions. 

My hope is that this helps some people who have been seeking to work with a professional or are just lost in where to go next when it comes to their voice.

2020-04-08 18:39:31,fxc2vc,0,1,"this is a story i started back in 2016, but didn't quite know how to finish. finally warped it up earlier this year. would love to illustrate parts of it. My grammar is a work in progress. let me know what you think. 

&amp;#x200B;

 **Slipping into my life** 

Hi, my name is Edmond, or I should say it used to be, and this is my story. It all started a few years ago when I was rising through the ranks as a clothing designer in the Fruit of the Loom Company working in the men's briefs division. I was fairly successful, with a couple of my designs making it into that fall's lineup. The company, however, was in a bit of upheaval as staff changed in corporate due to a recent merger. There was a lot of disorganization and short-staffing. So when it came about that the lead woman for the new designs in the lingerie department in charge of slips, shape ware , and nightgowns left on sick leave, it was requested that I fill in due to things being slower in my division, and I had a want to tap into my education in textile designs for that division.

Going in, I admit I had a slightly skewed view of what I was looking at with regards to my future clients. I had had rather limited interactions with women, and a majority of my interactions had been misunderstood. However, I was never one to turn down an opportunity that may lead to my advancement, so I accepted.

I started getting ready for the transition by preparing myself with a crash course in women's lingerie products; mainly slips. To be honest, I knew kind of what they were and what they were for, but I was in the dark, for the most part, as far as style. The beginning was kind of rough, with a lot of reviewing, on my own time, of textbooks and notes from three years past of school. My new boss, Karen, who oversees the whole woman's division, sympathized with me and thought it would be good to get into the swing of things in my new role by going through old patterns and observing the models as they did some of the shoots for the next season. She figured this would be good for me to see how the garments needed to hang and flow on real-life people.

The first few weeks I found myself down at the studio three to four times a week watching women walk and pose for the camera in various types of lingerie. Granted, I'm not complaining; I was always very picky with the women that I chose, there were a lot of models. How they felt so comfortable with me there I don't know, but I got the impression that they thought I swung the other way or was like the cameraman, who had been there for 30 years. I didn't think of myself as mean or misogynistic, no one ever really does; however, I have always been blunt and often critical.

It happened that about the third week in I was down to the studio watching one of the models, Stacy, model one of the mid length 24- or 26-inch Vassarette full slips for the fall catalog. I watched as she struck poses again and again and observed the way the slip fell and moved. It didn't help that it was a snow-white and slightly transparent, but it also made obvious a little extra weight in her stomach area that, in my mind, did not flatter the garment and would not make a good picture. I did not think about her feelings, audience for the pictures, or that I was fixating on only one thing about her (in reality) beautiful body. This wouldn't have been an issue, however, as the day wrapped up and we all started heading out to our cars, and I ran into Stacy walking out. We fell in stride and began walking out towards the exit to our cars.

She knew I was new and trying to adjust, and in small talk she asked me how I was adjusting to the job. I told her it was kind of a crash course, and definitely very different than the position that I had originally. 

She laughed lightly. ""You'll get the hang of it soon,"" she promised. She asked me then what I thought of her photo shoot that day. Without thinking I said I didn't think it went well, that she was a little big in areas to model the slip they had her in, and I don’t think the pictures would be what we were looking for. 

She stopped in her tracks looking hurt and angry. My brain did a double take realizing just how I sounded. I tried to stammer an apology, but she cut me off. ""The first thing you think of is a negative about my body? Not every shoot is perfect, not every woman can fit perfect standards! Are you buying the slip or do you model the slip?!? I wish you designers had to fit in and wear for work what you design so you can understand what we go through! I mean, how do they expect a guy to design women's wear?! It’s not like you’re going to know if it has good support or is comfortable! Do you realize the slip is not even designed to be seen?"" 

Stuttering an apology, I tried to make my exit as quick as I could. I could feel her staring daggers into my back as I rushed and got into my car.

I knew she was venting, but maybe she was right, and I wasn't cut out for this job. She was right about me having difficulty telling if it had adequate support or was comfortable. Maybe I should have just refused the move and stuck with what I knew and was comfortable with. My mother always said I was rather blunt. She blamed my still single status for that, and I guess she was right. Dejected and slightly depressed, I drove home, had dinner, and watched a couple shows. I went to bed passing a fitful night in which I barely slept. When I did sleep I had dreams of cramping and pain. I chalked it up to something I ate.

The next morning I woke, struggled to the bathroom, and went through my morning ritual. My work requires dress slacks with a dress shirt and tie most days except Friday. I put on a light cream shirt, blue tie, and gray slacks with black patent shoes, and a black belt. I drove to work fearing what Stacy might say to the other models and their reactions to me. I arrived at work rather early at about 7:30 and noticed that Stacy had not arrived. I was scheduled again to go down to the studio and watch. They were going to do another shoot on the slips and possibly start into some of the nightgowns. Later in the day I would actually sit down with some of the other design staff and start going through design ideas for next year.

I headed for the side door and saw in my peripheral vision Stacy pull in. I made it to the door as she parked and pulled it open, trying to duck in before she saw me. That's when it happened. It was like I hit and invisible wall. All of a sudden, time slowed down. My body tingled, and for a moment the world went fuzzy. I somehow continued forward and the wall seemed to dissipate as the tingling in my body went deeper. The fuzziness intensified, and I couldn't see my hands in front of me for a second. Then as my vision cleared, I watched them become slender, the hair disappearing from the knuckles. The hair on the back of my hand thinned to blond wisps, wrinkles disappeared, smoothing my skin. My nails extended, and a coating of red nail polish appeared on them. My eyes followed the transformation up arms to my shoulders then to my torso. I felt it continue up my neck, my head, and down my body to race over my thighs, waist, hips, and legs, down to my feet. It was a slightly uncomfortable yet slightly pleasurable transformation as my body rearranged itself into a new form with ample feminine curves replacing masculine angles.

I watched as, like bread rising, two mounds formed on my chest. It swelled out to what I would later find was a 34C cup. The most disconcerting part was when I realized I could no longer be referred to as a male. A tugging sensation in my crotch suddenly gave way to an empty feeling, which signified to my brain the withering of masculinity and blooming of my feminine flower. Looking down, I felt long hair brushing my shoulders and the nape of my neck as I inspected the changes that had happened to me.

Then the second part of the transformation was almost as disconcerting as the first part. It started underneath with my boxer briefs. They became much tighter and felt softer against my altered groin, transforming into black lace, overlaid silk, French cut panties. Next, there was a kind of tightening around my torso. I'm not sure what did what, but upon later inspection a matching black bra to the panties were the result, pushing up and supporting my new breasts. I felt like I was being submerged in a bath of silk around my torso as, what I'm sure had been my T-shirt, transmuted to nylon, lengthening down over my thighs, while losing its sleeves to lace straps. I could feel a slight soft abrasiveness as the collar of the former shirt descended into a V of lace trim and darted nylon that cupped over my bra. 

I then saw the material of my button-down shirt change as the tie disappeared and the shirt transmuted to a red, silk top. Looking down further, I saw my slacks recede up my legs and merge into a single tube of a black pencil skirt that's hem stopped at my knees. As the slacks, now skirt, receded it displayed my socks in their now feminine form. Smooth, sheer pantyhose now encased my sleek feminine legs, and as I watched I felt the pantyhose slide into place under my skirt and slip. The last things to transform were my shoes. I staggered forward, barely keeping my balance as they shrank down and grew a heel forming into three inch, black, pointed-toe heels. Finally starting to move, I felt a disconcerting sensation arise in my new body as the silkiness of my new undergarments brushed against my upper body and stomach and nylon encased thighs and legs. It was at that point that Stacy pushed the door open behind me and smiled a greeting at me.

""So, Elsa how was your evening? You run into any cute guys?"" I blinked in shock but somehow maintained a dazed composure. Stacy continued on not noticing my dazed look. ""Did you get a chance to think over some of my ideas for the new slip and nightgown line?"" At this my shock must have been evident. We had not discussed this before, let alone her give me ideas. ""Ah come on!"" she said. ""You said you were going to go over them last night, and you thought that some of them had a lot of potential. By the way, are you wearing that slip you had me look at yesterday? Like I said, the material is okay, however, it doesn't fit as well in the upper region as it should. I mean you're just as big as me in that department. What do you think? Is it keeping in place over your girls?""

Still shell-shocked, I gave a quick yes and made the excuse that I needed to check something in my office, and quickly started walking away. However, she matched my stride and kept up on her long model legs just behind me. Getting to my office, I went in and sat down in my chair with her still following.

""You know,” she said. “If all your time wasn't taken up with the designs, and the pay wasn't as good, you could be a model with your figure just as easily as I am."" Still in shock and stunned by this strange turn that made us seem like fast friends, I thanked her and muttered something about having to get a couple emails hacked out real quick before I went down to the studio. Understanding, she gave a slight wave saying, ""I'll see you in a little while then,"" and made her exit.

As the door shut, I breathed a huge sigh of relief and released a long string of expletives while staring down at my new body. She was right, I could take her place in a shoot if needed. Shifting in the chair, I felt the slip shift under my skirt and over my pantyhose reminding me of the shoot yesterday and what she had said about the purpose of a slip and her blanket wish for the designers. A small light bulb went off as I thought about that and tried to piece together what would've caused my transformation. Stacy's wish is what my mind kept coming back to. But how was it even possible?

Still mulling it over, I opened up my computer and signed on to look at emails. This may be a fucked up situation, but apparently I still had the same position in this reality, and I didn't want my boss to think that I was having an identity crisis with a mental breakdown and get suspended, at least not yet.

Opening my emails I found my new signature and identity. Apparently, I was the same age and had a similar history except, for now, my name was Elsa and I was female. I quickly logged on to my phone and checked my Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest. I discovered I was a bit of a girly-girl now. Most of the pictures of myself had me in dresses or skirts with excellent makeup. In my Pinterest I found folders dedicated to dresses, skirts, slips, and pantyhose. I breathed a sigh of relief after checking my relationship status. I was still single; for some reason I feared that I might be married in this new reality. Turning back to my computer, I finished up writing my emails and made my way down to the studio to watch the shoot. As I walked I became more comfortable with the sensations that women's clothes impart. However, the swing of my hips and the bounce of my breasts were a bit harder to adjust to.

The first set of girls were ready and getting into place for their shots when I walked in. Stacy was one of them; she smiled and waved when she saw me. I noticed that she had on the same version of the slip she had been modeling yesterday, only it was four inches shorter. It looked a lot better to me today for some reason. Maybe it was her smile. I had to admit she had a beautiful one. After watching a little while and seeing how the slips moved, I went over to my boss to get her thoughts.

She greeted me as if nothing had changed, which I guess I expected. She leaned over and asked, ""What do you think of the shoots so far?"" I told her that they had went well over all, in my opinion, and this set was looking promising. Then she caught me off guard and asked if I was wearing the slip I said I was going to yesterday? Shock took me again. *How many people did I talk to about my wardrobe in this reality?* I thought. I quickly recovered, replying that yes I was.

""Well?"" she asked. ""What does your body say? Is it as comfortable and does it fit properly?"" Reeling for an answer I went with what Stacy had said that morning, that the material was good, but I didn't really like the way the bodice fit over my bra. Nodding, my boss signified her agreement. ""That's why I like that you take our work so seriously and want try them out yourself before letting me send them on to our panel and quality control. I guess we'll need to sit down and make a few adjustments before we look at sending that one on.""

This comment just cemented my fears that my change was due to Stacy's wish yesterday.

Still in a slight state of shock at what my new, more intimate part in the design meant, I excused myself back to my office to go over some of the new patterns I was working on. Back in my office, I started going through the papers on my desk and found a sheet of paper with Stacy’s suggestions for modifications to a few of the patterns I was working on. I tucked it into my briefcase to go over later that evening in case it came up when we talked, given the closeness of our new relationship. I then checked over my emails again, wrote a few replies, and clocked out.

Heading for the exit, Stacy met up with me again. I could hear the click of a second set of heels aside from mine, and I turned and waited, seeing her striding quickly after me. ""Hey, Elsa, tomorrow did you want to try on that one nightgown that we were discussing the other day?"" I gave her a slightly blank look. ""Remember you were thinking of using some parts of the bodice in the new line?"" 

""Oh, yeah sure,” I said. “It kind of slipped my mind."" I was only slightly shocked by this request given the other events of the day. I ask her how she thought the photo shoot went that day. 

""I think it went a lot better,"" she said. “I’m not as crampy today so I feel a lot better and more natural.”

I was dumbstruck thinking about the implications for me. I would be having a monthly period! I would have PMS! I would have to use a tampon! 

""You know, us girls, we’ve got to watch out for each other. Guys just don't understand,"" Stacy continued, interrupting my sudden realization. 

*You can say that again*, I thought as she moved past me towards the door, pushing it open and holding it. I told her to go ahead as I paused to readjust my strap on my computer case. I then followed.

As I pushed the door open, that same tingling sensation and fuzziness from that morning hit me again. I felt it wash over my body, and everything that happened that morning reversed. I felt it as my body first, then my clothes, reverted back to their male form. The silkiness and open sensation of the pantyhose, slip, and skirt were being replaced by the feel of slacks and men’s business wear. My male angles reasserted themselves as my breasts melted away. I looked down as the door closed behind me.

I was completely male again. I looked back at the door before walking towards my car. I looked over at Stacy as I arrived at my car and she climbed in hers. She didn't even notice me now. I guess that's more definitive proof that I switched realities. Climbing into my car, I reflected on the whole situation. A large part of me hoped that this was a one-time thing and I would stay male tomorrow. I like having my parts that I was familiar with, after all. However, a small part liked the closeness of my friendship with Stacy and the other girls and knowing firsthand the benefits and downfalls of my clothing designs.

After that day’s strange events at work, I stayed in and busied myself with a few work things for the next day. I was surprised that the recommendations Stacy had given me were still in my briefcase; it was the only physical reminder that the transformation had happened that day. After going through them a few times, I relaxed watching an old movie while getting dinner.

I slept a little bit better than the night before but still fitfully. The next morning I went through my normal routine. I decided on a pair of microfiber khakis, a white button-down shirt, a brown tie, and brown shoes. I drove into work, and this time Stacy beat me there. I saw her walking towards the door. She looked back and seemed to give a half-hearted attempt at holding the door as I began the walk from the car. I arrived at the door and hesitated, unsure what to expect, but bracing myself either way.

I was hit by the same sensation of the tingling and the fuzzy vision as I passed over the threshold. I felt everything shift and change again. My pectorals swelled quickly into the two generous 34C breasts. My male angles receded and feminine curves accentuated themselves. My hair fell over my shoulders, and this time I noticed the feeling of makeup as it appeared on my face. A set of earrings and a necklace enhanced my look further and indicated the start of my clothes shifting to their feminine form.

Again, it started with my boxer briefs. They shrank into a set of silky white panties with a hint of lace over the crotch. Next, I felt part of my T-shirt tighten into a bra with lace sides and smooth microfiber cups that matched the panties. I felt the slip as it formed around my torso and over my blossomed bosom. A lace bodice with thin spaghetti straps formed and I felt the silken folds cascade down, sending their lower lace hem dancing just above my knees. This time the slip felt like it had more lace than yesterday.

Tilting my head down, I watched my button-down shirt transform. Its sleeves shrank as the buttons disappeared, and the sides merged together as the collar plunged slightly, forming a white, dressy tank top. My top remained tucked into my khakis as the changes began to affect them. The khakis, instead of shrinking like yesterday, began to lengthen as they melded together, and the material changed color and texture to a silky, pastel, pink-purple with a flowered pattern. I continued to feel the hem of the slip gently brush and dance against my legs just above my knees as the skirt began to caress it. This feeling changes as, once again, pantyhose raced up my legs. This time they were tan control tops that encased my legs and slid up over my hips and waist. White sandals with a slight heel formed below my feet, replacing my brown loafers. I felt my hair change position as it formed into a neat French braid that did itself up over my head. It was kind of nice to have it out of the way.

Looking up, I saw Stacy a little further down the hallway. She had looked back, and seeing me, she was smiling and waiting for me. ""So, do anything exciting last night?"" she asked. ""Did you see that new episode of the bachelorette? That one dress she had on; I don't know how she pulled it off, but wow! I don't think you or I could have done it.""

I nodded in absent agreement. 

""So,"" she said, moving on, ""What's on your docket today?"" 

My boss and I had talked briefly about plans and figured that I should be dropping into the studio again for a little bit, but she also wanted me to focus mainly on design plans for today and for the next couple weeks. 

""Well,"" I said, ""it sounds like I'm going to be quarantined to my office for a while."" 

She sighed. ""Well, I guess a girl can’t get everything she wants, I was looking forward to you being there to get more feedback at the shoot. By the way, what slip are you wearing today?"" she asked.

I paused, not really sure which one I was wearing. I could feel the lace brushing my thighs, and it was definitely more than an inch, but I couldn't tell exactly which one. 

""It's one of my Vaux ones,"" I said quickly, remembering the designs I was looking at last night. 

""Well,"" she said. ""I went with the Isabella.” She lifted her skirt ever so slightly to show the white lace and a bit of the material of her slip beneath. “You know, this is one of my favorites,"" she said. ""I love the lace detailing in the top and hem. Plus, I think it makes my butt look good."" She giggled as she smacked her butt. I have to admit, I had to agree there. I mocked a wolf whistle and she laughed and patted me on the shoulder. ""Well,"" she said, ""do you want to go try on that nightgown now, or do you want to do it a little later?"" 

“I should really go to my office and get through some emails and talk to Karen on some designs. I did look at some of your suggestions last night though,"" I said. 

""You did!"" she said excitedly as she pulled me into a hug. As our breasts pushed together a sensation awoke in me, warm and soothing. That's when I realized how physically attracted to her I was. In surprise, I quickly released her.

“We’ll talk more later at the studio!"" I said as I headed for my office.

The morning went pretty well. Karen liked the ideas for the beginning of the designs, and a little after lunch I headed to the studio. I saw a few of the girls getting ready for the long camisole nightgown shots. I quickly asked where Stacy was, and they pointed back towards the dressing room. I thanked them and headed back. Stacy was in the midst of changing from one nightgown to another. She was clad only in her bra and panties. I halted abruptly as I came in. ""Oh hey,"" she said looking up at me. All I could do was stare; she was gorgeous! I don't know how a few days ago I could've thought she was pudgy.

""What?” she asked, noticing my obvious pause. ""A little body envy, or cat got your tongue? Don't worry, I think yours is just as nice.""

""Sorry,"" I said. ""If you want I'll come back when you’re finished.""

""No, it's fine,"" she said. ""Well,"" she paused, reaching over to the dressing table and pulling a blue silky garment from it. “Take off those street clothes and try this on,"" she said as she tossed the article. 

I looked at it. It was an older style nightgown (obviously the one she had told me about). Hesitantly, I pulled my shirt over my head and started to turn my skirt around to get to the zipper. 

""Here,"" she said. ""Let me help you with that,"" as she grabbed the zipper on the back of my skirt, gently pulling it down. The skirt fluttered to the floor revealing my slip underneath. She looked at me with an exacting stare. ""Yes, definitely a body that could model,"" she said, giving me a playful swipe on the shoulders. I pulled up the slip, grabbing the hem, and pulled it over my head, still wondering at the silky caress of it as it brushed over my nylons and soft female skin as it came off. 

""There you go,"" she said. ""Oh, I like that bra and panty set. I have one similar but in red. Here,"" she said handing me the nightgown again from where I had set it on the chair. I delicately bunched the material up and put it over my head, inserting my hands through the spaghetti straps and letting it flow down over my body.

It was extremely soft, maybe even softer than my slip. It came down to my ankles with delicate lace on the bodice and hem. It was sky blue with a silky luster. 

""What was the material again?"" I asked.

""I believe it was a poly-spandex and nylon blend,"" she said, reaching out to rub a fold on the skirt of the nightgown between her fingers. I swished back and forth and did a half-twirl, feeling the way the soft material caressed my curves and flowed over my nylon clad legs. For a nightgown without cups, it actually had fairly good coverage over my breasts. I liked it.

""Well?"" Stacy asked. ""What do you think?""

""I like it,"" I replied. ""Who designed it?"" I asked. 

""It was one of Helen's. She worked here before you, she went on leave and it had a few kinks so it never made it to the production line. You would know better than I what she said regarding revision plans. She gave me this one to try on and give her a gauge for how it felt. Before she left she told me to keep it and let her predecessor work with it; that she had other fish to fry now.""

""I see, well I might have to borrow it sometime. I really do like the design,"" I said.

""I will see her later this week and let her know and double check,"" Stacy said smiling. “I'm sure she wouldn't mind helping out a girlfriend of mine.""

""Sounds good,"" I said. ""I need to be getting back over to the office, I have to check in with Karen soon.""

I reach down and gathered the hem and pulled the nightgown up and tried to pull it over my head. The back shoulder straps tangled slightly with my bra and I had trouble extracting it. Stacy embraced me and reached around behind to untangle it. The nightgown came away, and I again felt the feeling I felt this morning as our breasts pressed together, this time only clad in our panties and bras. We were left looking into each other’s eyes. 

There was a pregnant pause and Stacy softly asked, ""May I?"" I had an idea what she was asking as I nodded yes, but it still surprised me as she gently pressed her lips against mine. As I felt her soft, moist lips press against mine, I tasted cherry. Stacy was kissing me! I closed my eyes and gave in, kissing her back. I slightly opened my mouth, flicking my tongue out to play with hers. She reciprocated and we continued for a little bit before we suddenly remembered where we were and pulled away.

""Well,"" I said awkwardly. ""That is some good cherry lip gloss! The lips attached to it aren't that bad either. I should be getting back before I'm missed.""

She smiled deviously, licking her lips. Hurriedly, I pulled up my slip and slid my shirt over my head adjusting it into place over my breasts and bra. I then slid my skirt back on. Stacy reached behind me and gently zipped it up for me while lightly patting my butt as she did so. 

""Thanks,"" I said, reciprocating the gesture before pulling up my skirt to adjust and straighten my slip. We headed for the door and stopped before opening it.

""Elsa,"" Stacy said. ""You won't mention this, will you? Some of the girls we work with might not understand. Don't get me wrong, whenever I see you at work I wish you were my girlfriend, but I'm not sure how it would be accepted."" A slight shudder passed through me like I had felt when she wished for me to know what it felt like to wear what I made.

""Don't worry, it's safe with me,"" I answered. 

“Good,” she said before leaning in and kissing me again. We broke the kiss and I smiled and ducked out the door. Later that day, I was looking through my purse and found a picture and note from Stacy; the note was apparently a few months old by the crease lines and had evidence of being read and re-read. The note said:

*""Dear Elsa,*

*I'm so glad that you could confide in me, at the time I was a bit shocked, but not for the reason you think. You see I like you and am attracted to women and men. I didn't know how to tell you that then, or that I am attracted to you. Your eyes, the way you smile, the way you talk (you’re always too witty), even the way you dress. You know how to put yourself together. The way you listen to my ideas and seek out my input makes me feel special. I could go on but really that's best left for in person in the late hours of the night, that is, if you would say yes to becoming my girlfriend. I know it's a big step. It would be best to keep it quiet for a while, I think, so we can feel things out.*

*Find me after work and we will go from there.*

*With Love,*

*Stacy""*

Once more in shock, I sat back hard in my chair. So, it appeared that now Stacy and I are and had been girlfriends for more than a little bit. Thinking back, I remembered her wish just after the kiss. What was causing this? How did she have this power over me?

I was distracted from the thought when Stacy knocked on my door. “You ready to go, hon?"" she asked.

""Give me a second, Stac,"" I said. She looked down the hall before walking over and saw the note in my hand.

""Ah,"" She said. ""Reminiscing are we?"" as she gently massaged my shoulders before leaning down and giving me a light kiss. ""Now hurry up so there can be more of that. Remember you’re coming over to my place tonight.""

""Okay, okay,"" I said, feeling my body responding to her. I packed up my stuff quickly and we headed for the door. Walking down the hall she asked what I felt like for dinner as she pushed open the door.

“Maybe Chinese,” I said, stepping through. The tingly feeling and fuzzy vision happened, and everything changed again. 

Coming out of my daze I heard Stacy say, ""You know, Chinese doesn't sound that bad tonight. I might do that myself. You’re not so bad after you get over how blunt you can be sometimes. See you tomorrow."" I could have wept. I trudged to my car and watched as Stacy drove away. Now that feeling I had this time yesterday was definitely leaning on the opposite end. Maybe it was hormones, but I would go to the ends of the earth to stay with her. The problem was that Stacy seemed to have fallen for the woman me, and she was the only one who seemed to have the power to change me, and she didn't even realize it.

The next couple days I was subjected to office work and didn’t see Stacy much except for in passing. Each day going in, my clothes transformed along with my body to their female equivalent, either skirt or dress with the accompanying pantyhose. On Friday I began to get curious on what would happen if I wore an outfit other than business clothes. It being casual Friday I decided to wear a nice T-shirt and my nicer jeans. I also packed a backpack with a set of khakis and a dress shirt in case something I wore ended up being too revealing. 

As I walked through the door I felt my body transform, my angles disappearing and feminine curves coming back out and my breasts swelling. Then I watched as my clothes transformed from jeans material to a silky floral print. The garment then ascended up my legs forming into a tight little skirt that came down four inches above my knees with a cute one-inch lace trim at the hem. Beneath it I could feel the normal slide of panties and slip, only this time I realized it was a micro half-slip. My T-shirt, I realized, was now a black lacy halter top.

At that point, Stacy walked in and she let out a low wolf whistle. She walked up to me and whispered in my ear, “Girl, you make me feel like a woman.”

*Yeah*, I thought to myself, *I definitely do.*

“I really like that skirt,” she said. “Although, its kind of daring wearing it into work, I would say, but knowing Karen she'll like it.”

“Yeah,” I said. “It definitely is a cute outfit.”

“So,” she asks, “You have any plans for the weekend yet? I know we talked a little but hadn’t nailed anything down yet. One of the other girls mentioned a thing tonight if you want to go out. They are heading to this new place over off Fourth and Main. They have pretty good drinks and it's kind of low-key.” I told her I would like to, and I would let her know later that day. 

With that, I headed to my office. Designs were progressing fairly well; I had one of the full slips designed and was partway through the half-slips. The designs were set to go out to the seamstress that day so that next week sometime we could get an idea of how it looked. I was kind of excited; this would be my first set of women's lingerie. I had not only designed it, but I was able to input my knowledge as a woman and be able to wear it too. 

At the end of the day as I left, I so wished the curse or blessing or whatever it was would extend for just one more day and I would not be reverted back. 

Stacy caught up to me as I was about to leave so she asked, “Did you decide? You didn’t text me about it. I was kind of looking forward to it as we haven’t spent much time together yet as a couple, even if it is private.”

Without thinking I said, “Yes, I would love to and I wish we could too.” That’s when we waked through the door. I felt the familiar tingle of changing, but also the one that I associated with Stacy making a wish, and everything went fuzzy. 

When it stopped, Stacy was in front of me and my mind was in a mental fog. “Hun, are you ok?” she asked.

“I think so,” I said looking down. I realized I was still dressed as a woman, however, I felt different. I felt parts of me that were definitely male, but I also felt feminine still. I could feel my old friend securely between my legs, but also a bra cradling my chest.

“What happened to me? Why I am dressed like this?” I asked, still in a bit of a fog. 

“Hun, you’re gender fluid, you dress like this about half your time. I don’t understand it, but you do make an attractive woman, and man. It’s one of the things I love about you. You are both for me. You happen to be female today, Elsa, and if we don’t hurry our pretty little butts up, we’re going to be late. The rest of the girls will be waiting at the club for us.” Realization swept over me. My wish had been granted, I was with Stacy outside of work, and not only that, but now I had both worlds.

I looked around for my car but didn’t see it. “Uhh, Stacy where is my car?” I asked.

“You silly, did you hit your head or something coming out?” she asked, giving it a kiss and turning my face to look at her. “We haven’t driven separate since we moved in together five months ago.”



All the best, Becky xoxox",genderfluid,Story I started a while back but didn't finish until this year.,1586396371.0,"{'created_utc': 1586371171, 'id': 'fxc2vc', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'this is a story i started back in 2016, but didn\'t quite know how to finish. finally warped it up earlier this year. would love to illustrate parts of it. My grammar is a work in progress. let me know what you think. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **Slipping into my life** \n\nHi, my name is Edmond, or I should say it used to be, and this is my story. It all started a few years ago when I was rising through the ranks as a clothing designer in the Fruit of the Loom Company working in the men\'s briefs division. I was fairly successful, with a couple of my designs making it into that fall\'s lineup. The company, however, was in a bit of upheaval as staff changed in corporate due to a recent merger. There was a lot of disorganization and short-staffing. So when it came about that the lead woman for the new designs in the lingerie department in charge of slips, shape ware , and nightgowns left on sick leave, it was requested that I fill in due to things being slower in my division, and I had a want to tap into my education in textile designs for that division.\n\nGoing in, I admit I had a slightly skewed view of what I was looking at with regards to my future clients. I had had rather limited interactions with women, and a majority of my interactions had been misunderstood. However, I was never one to turn down an opportunity that may lead to my advancement, so I accepted.\n\nI started getting ready for the transition by preparing myself with a crash course in women\'s lingerie products; mainly slips. To be honest, I knew kind of what they were and what they were for, but I was in the dark, for the most part, as far as style. The beginning was kind of rough, with a lot of reviewing, on my own time, of textbooks and notes from three years past of school. My new boss, Karen, who oversees the whole woman\'s division, sympathized with me and thought it would be good to get into the swing of things in my new role by going through old patterns and observing the models as they did some of the shoots for the next season. She figured this would be good for me to see how the garments needed to hang and flow on real-life people.\n\nThe first few weeks I found myself down at the studio three to four times a week watching women walk and pose for the camera in various types of lingerie. Granted, I\'m not complaining; I was always very picky with the women that I chose, there were a lot of models. How they felt so comfortable with me there I don\'t know, but I got the impression that they thought I swung the other way or was like the cameraman, who had been there for 30 years. I didn\'t think of myself as mean or misogynistic, no one ever really does; however, I have always been blunt and often critical.\n\nIt happened that about the third week in I was down to the studio watching one of the models, Stacy, model one of the mid length 24- or 26-inch Vassarette full slips for the fall catalog. I watched as she struck poses again and again and observed the way the slip fell and moved. It didn\'t help that it was a snow-white and slightly transparent, but it also made obvious a little extra weight in her stomach area that, in my mind, did not flatter the garment and would not make a good picture. I did not think about her feelings, audience for the pictures, or that I was fixating on only one thing about her (in reality) beautiful body. This wouldn\'t have been an issue, however, as the day wrapped up and we all started heading out to our cars, and I ran into Stacy walking out. We fell in stride and began walking out towards the exit to our cars.\n\nShe knew I was new and trying to adjust, and in small talk she asked me how I was adjusting to the job. I told her it was kind of a crash course, and definitely very different than the position that I had originally. \n\nShe laughed lightly. ""You\'ll get the hang of it soon,"" she promised. She asked me then what I thought of her photo shoot that day. Without thinking I said I didn\'t think it went well, that she was a little big in areas to model the slip they had her in, and I don’t think the pictures would be what we were looking for. \n\nShe stopped in her tracks looking hurt and angry. My brain did a double take realizing just how I sounded. I tried to stammer an apology, but she cut me off. ""The first thing you think of is a negative about my body? Not every shoot is perfect, not every woman can fit perfect standards! Are you buying the slip or do you model the slip?!? I wish you designers had to fit in and wear for work what you design so you can understand what we go through! I mean, how do they expect a guy to design women\'s wear?! It’s not like you’re going to know if it has good support or is comfortable! Do you realize the slip is not even designed to be seen?"" \n\nStuttering an apology, I tried to make my exit as quick as I could. I could feel her staring daggers into my back as I rushed and got into my car.\n\nI knew she was venting, but maybe she was right, and I wasn\'t cut out for this job. She was right about me having difficulty telling if it had adequate support or was comfortable. Maybe I should have just refused the move and stuck with what I knew and was comfortable with. My mother always said I was rather blunt. She blamed my still single status for that, and I guess she was right. Dejected and slightly depressed, I drove home, had dinner, and watched a couple shows. I went to bed passing a fitful night in which I barely slept. When I did sleep I had dreams of cramping and pain. I chalked it up to something I ate.\n\nThe next morning I woke, struggled to the bathroom, and went through my morning ritual. My work requires dress slacks with a dress shirt and tie most days except Friday. I put on a light cream shirt, blue tie, and gray slacks with black patent shoes, and a black belt. I drove to work fearing what Stacy might say to the other models and their reactions to me. I arrived at work rather early at about 7:30 and noticed that Stacy had not arrived. I was scheduled again to go down to the studio and watch. They were going to do another shoot on the slips and possibly start into some of the nightgowns. Later in the day I would actually sit down with some of the other design staff and start going through design ideas for next year.\n\nI headed for the side door and saw in my peripheral vision Stacy pull in. I made it to the door as she parked and pulled it open, trying to duck in before she saw me. That\'s when it happened. It was like I hit and invisible wall. All of a sudden, time slowed down. My body tingled, and for a moment the world went fuzzy. I somehow continued forward and the wall seemed to dissipate as the tingling in my body went deeper. The fuzziness intensified, and I couldn\'t see my hands in front of me for a second. Then as my vision cleared, I watched them become slender, the hair disappearing from the knuckles. The hair on the back of my hand thinned to blond wisps, wrinkles disappeared, smoothing my skin. My nails extended, and a coating of red nail polish appeared on them. My eyes followed the transformation up arms to my shoulders then to my torso. I felt it continue up my neck, my head, and down my body to race over my thighs, waist, hips, and legs, down to my feet. It was a slightly uncomfortable yet slightly pleasurable transformation as my body rearranged itself into a new form with ample feminine curves replacing masculine angles.\n\nI watched as, like bread rising, two mounds formed on my chest. It swelled out to what I would later find was a 34C cup. The most disconcerting part was when I realized I could no longer be referred to as a male. A tugging sensation in my crotch suddenly gave way to an empty feeling, which signified to my brain the withering of masculinity and blooming of my feminine flower. Looking down, I felt long hair brushing my shoulders and the nape of my neck as I inspected the changes that had happened to me.\n\nThen the second part of the transformation was almost as disconcerting as the first part. It started underneath with my boxer briefs. They became much tighter and felt softer against my altered groin, transforming into black lace, overlaid silk, French cut panties. Next, there was a kind of tightening around my torso. I\'m not sure what did what, but upon later inspection a matching black bra to the panties were the result, pushing up and supporting my new breasts. I felt like I was being submerged in a bath of silk around my torso as, what I\'m sure had been my T-shirt, transmuted to nylon, lengthening down over my thighs, while losing its sleeves to lace straps. I could feel a slight soft abrasiveness as the collar of the former shirt descended into a V of lace trim and darted nylon that cupped over my bra. \n\nI then saw the material of my button-down shirt change as the tie disappeared and the shirt transmuted to a red, silk top. Looking down further, I saw my slacks recede up my legs and merge into a single tube of a black pencil skirt that\'s hem stopped at my knees. As the slacks, now skirt, receded it displayed my socks in their now feminine form. Smooth, sheer pantyhose now encased my sleek feminine legs, and as I watched I felt the pantyhose slide into place under my skirt and slip. The last things to transform were my shoes. I staggered forward, barely keeping my balance as they shrank down and grew a heel forming into three inch, black, pointed-toe heels. Finally starting to move, I felt a disconcerting sensation arise in my new body as the silkiness of my new undergarments brushed against my upper body and stomach and nylon encased thighs and legs. It was at that point that Stacy pushed the door open behind me and smiled a greeting at me.\n\n""So, Elsa how was your evening? You run into any cute guys?"" I blinked in shock but somehow maintained a dazed composure. Stacy continued on not noticing my dazed look. ""Did you get a chance to think over some of my ideas for the new slip and nightgown line?"" At this my shock must have been evident. We had not discussed this before, let alone her give me ideas. ""Ah come on!"" she said. ""You said you were going to go over them last night, and you thought that some of them had a lot of potential. By the way, are you wearing that slip you had me look at yesterday? Like I said, the material is okay, however, it doesn\'t fit as well in the upper region as it should. I mean you\'re just as big as me in that department. What do you think? Is it keeping in place over your girls?""\n\nStill shell-shocked, I gave a quick yes and made the excuse that I needed to check something in my office, and quickly started walking away. However, she matched my stride and kept up on her long model legs just behind me. Getting to my office, I went in and sat down in my chair with her still following.\n\n""You know,” she said. “If all your time wasn\'t taken up with the designs, and the pay wasn\'t as good, you could be a model with your figure just as easily as I am."" Still in shock and stunned by this strange turn that made us seem like fast friends, I thanked her and muttered something about having to get a couple emails hacked out real quick before I went down to the studio. Understanding, she gave a slight wave saying, ""I\'ll see you in a little while then,"" and made her exit.\n\nAs the door shut, I breathed a huge sigh of relief and released a long string of expletives while staring down at my new body. She was right, I could take her place in a shoot if needed. Shifting in the chair, I felt the slip shift under my skirt and over my pantyhose reminding me of the shoot yesterday and what she had said about the purpose of a slip and her blanket wish for the designers. A small light bulb went off as I thought about that and tried to piece together what would\'ve caused my transformation. Stacy\'s wish is what my mind kept coming back to. But how was it even possible?\n\nStill mulling it over, I opened up my computer and signed on to look at emails. This may be a fucked up situation, but apparently I still had the same position in this reality, and I didn\'t want my boss to think that I was having an identity crisis with a mental breakdown and get suspended, at least not yet.\n\nOpening my emails I found my new signature and identity. Apparently, I was the same age and had a similar history except, for now, my name was Elsa and I was female. I quickly logged on to my phone and checked my Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest. I discovered I was a bit of a girly-girl now. Most of the pictures of myself had me in dresses or skirts with excellent makeup. In my Pinterest I found folders dedicated to dresses, skirts, slips, and pantyhose. I breathed a sigh of relief after checking my relationship status. I was still single; for some reason I feared that I might be married in this new reality. Turning back to my computer, I finished up writing my emails and made my way down to the studio to watch the shoot. As I walked I became more comfortable with the sensations that women\'s clothes impart. However, the swing of my hips and the bounce of my breasts were a bit harder to adjust to.\n\nThe first set of girls were ready and getting into place for their shots when I walked in. Stacy was one of them; she smiled and waved when she saw me. I noticed that she had on the same version of the slip she had been modeling yesterday, only it was four inches shorter. It looked a lot better to me today for some reason. Maybe it was her smile. I had to admit she had a beautiful one. After watching a little while and seeing how the slips moved, I went over to my boss to get her thoughts.\n\nShe greeted me as if nothing had changed, which I guess I expected. She leaned over and asked, ""What do you think of the shoots so far?"" I told her that they had went well over all, in my opinion, and this set was looking promising. Then she caught me off guard and asked if I was wearing the slip I said I was going to yesterday? Shock took me again. *How many people did I talk to about my wardrobe in this reality?* I thought. I quickly recovered, replying that yes I was.\n\n""Well?"" she asked. ""What does your body say? Is it as comfortable and does it fit properly?"" Reeling for an answer I went with what Stacy had said that morning, that the material was good, but I didn\'t really like the way the bodice fit over my bra. Nodding, my boss signified her agreement. ""That\'s why I like that you take our work so seriously and want try them out yourself before letting me send them on to our panel and quality control. I guess we\'ll need to sit down and make a few adjustments before we look at sending that one on.""\n\nThis comment just cemented my fears that my change was due to Stacy\'s wish yesterday.\n\nStill in a slight state of shock at what my new, more intimate part in the design meant, I excused myself back to my office to go over some of the new patterns I was working on. Back in my office, I started going through the papers on my desk and found a sheet of paper with Stacy’s suggestions for modifications to a few of the patterns I was working on. I tucked it into my briefcase to go over later that evening in case it came up when we talked, given the closeness of our new relationship. I then checked over my emails again, wrote a few replies, and clocked out.\n\nHeading for the exit, Stacy met up with me again. I could hear the click of a second set of heels aside from mine, and I turned and waited, seeing her striding quickly after me. ""Hey, Elsa, tomorrow did you want to try on that one nightgown that we were discussing the other day?"" I gave her a slightly blank look. ""Remember you were thinking of using some parts of the bodice in the new line?"" \n\n""Oh, yeah sure,” I said. “It kind of slipped my mind."" I was only slightly shocked by this request given the other events of the day. I ask her how she thought the photo shoot went that day. \n\n""I think it went a lot better,"" she said. “I’m not as crampy today so I feel a lot better and more natural.”\n\nI was dumbstruck thinking about the implications for me. I would be having a monthly period! I would have PMS! I would have to use a tampon! \n\n""You know, us girls, we’ve got to watch out for each other. Guys just don\'t understand,"" Stacy continued, interrupting my sudden realization. \n\n*You can say that again*, I thought as she moved past me towards the door, pushing it open and holding it. I told her to go ahead as I paused to readjust my strap on my computer case. I then followed.\n\nAs I pushed the door open, that same tingling sensation and fuzziness from that morning hit me again. I felt it wash over my body, and everything that happened that morning reversed. I felt it as my body first, then my clothes, reverted back to their male form. The silkiness and open sensation of the pantyhose, slip, and skirt were being replaced by the feel of slacks and men’s business wear. My male angles reasserted themselves as my breasts melted away. I looked down as the door closed behind me.\n\nI was completely male again. I looked back at the door before walking towards my car. I looked over at Stacy as I arrived at my car and she climbed in hers. She didn\'t even notice me now. I guess that\'s more definitive proof that I switched realities. Climbing into my car, I reflected on the whole situation. A large part of me hoped that this was a one-time thing and I would stay male tomorrow. I like having my parts that I was familiar with, after all. However, a small part liked the closeness of my friendship with Stacy and the other girls and knowing firsthand the benefits and downfalls of my clothing designs.\n\nAfter that day’s strange events at work, I stayed in and busied myself with a few work things for the next day. I was surprised that the recommendations Stacy had given me were still in my briefcase; it was the only physical reminder that the transformation had happened that day. After going through them a few times, I relaxed watching an old movie while getting dinner.\n\nI slept a little bit better than the night before but still fitfully. The next morning I went through my normal routine. I decided on a pair of microfiber khakis, a white button-down shirt, a brown tie, and brown shoes. I drove into work, and this time Stacy beat me there. I saw her walking towards the door. She looked back and seemed to give a half-hearted attempt at holding the door as I began the walk from the car. I arrived at the door and hesitated, unsure what to expect, but bracing myself either way.\n\nI was hit by the same sensation of the tingling and the fuzzy vision as I passed over the threshold. I felt everything shift and change again. My pectorals swelled quickly into the two generous 34C breasts. My male angles receded and feminine curves accentuated themselves. My hair fell over my shoulders, and this time I noticed the feeling of makeup as it appeared on my face. A set of earrings and a necklace enhanced my look further and indicated the start of my clothes shifting to their feminine form.\n\nAgain, it started with my boxer briefs. They shrank into a set of silky white panties with a hint of lace over the crotch. Next, I felt part of my T-shirt tighten into a bra with lace sides and smooth microfiber cups that matched the panties. I felt the slip as it formed around my torso and over my blossomed bosom. A lace bodice with thin spaghetti straps formed and I felt the silken folds cascade down, sending their lower lace hem dancing just above my knees. This time the slip felt like it had more lace than yesterday.\n\nTilting my head down, I watched my button-down shirt transform. Its sleeves shrank as the buttons disappeared, and the sides merged together as the collar plunged slightly, forming a white, dressy tank top. My top remained tucked into my khakis as the changes began to affect them. The khakis, instead of shrinking like yesterday, began to lengthen as they melded together, and the material changed color and texture to a silky, pastel, pink-purple with a flowered pattern. I continued to feel the hem of the slip gently brush and dance against my legs just above my knees as the skirt began to caress it. This feeling changes as, once again, pantyhose raced up my legs. This time they were tan control tops that encased my legs and slid up over my hips and waist. White sandals with a slight heel formed below my feet, replacing my brown loafers. I felt my hair change position as it formed into a neat French braid that did itself up over my head. It was kind of nice to have it out of the way.\n\nLooking up, I saw Stacy a little further down the hallway. She had looked back, and seeing me, she was smiling and waiting for me. ""So, do anything exciting last night?"" she asked. ""Did you see that new episode of the bachelorette? That one dress she had on; I don\'t know how she pulled it off, but wow! I don\'t think you or I could have done it.""\n\nI nodded in absent agreement. \n\n""So,"" she said, moving on, ""What\'s on your docket today?"" \n\nMy boss and I had talked briefly about plans and figured that I should be dropping into the studio again for a little bit, but she also wanted me to focus mainly on design plans for today and for the next couple weeks. \n\n""Well,"" I said, ""it sounds like I\'m going to be quarantined to my office for a while."" \n\nShe sighed. ""Well, I guess a girl can’t get everything she wants, I was looking forward to you being there to get more feedback at the shoot. By the way, what slip are you wearing today?"" she asked.\n\nI paused, not really sure which one I was wearing. I could feel the lace brushing my thighs, and it was definitely more than an inch, but I couldn\'t tell exactly which one. \n\n""It\'s one of my Vaux ones,"" I said quickly, remembering the designs I was looking at last night. \n\n""Well,"" she said. ""I went with the Isabella.” She lifted her skirt ever so slightly to show the white lace and a bit of the material of her slip beneath. “You know, this is one of my favorites,"" she said. ""I love the lace detailing in the top and hem. Plus, I think it makes my butt look good."" She giggled as she smacked her butt. I have to admit, I had to agree there. I mocked a wolf whistle and she laughed and patted me on the shoulder. ""Well,"" she said, ""do you want to go try on that nightgown now, or do you want to do it a little later?"" \n\n“I should really go to my office and get through some emails and talk to Karen on some designs. I did look at some of your suggestions last night though,"" I said. \n\n""You did!"" she said excitedly as she pulled me into a hug. As our breasts pushed together a sensation awoke in me, warm and soothing. That\'s when I realized how physically attracted to her I was. In surprise, I quickly released her.\n\n“We’ll talk more later at the studio!"" I said as I headed for my office.\n\nThe morning went pretty well. Karen liked the ideas for the beginning of the designs, and a little after lunch I headed to the studio. I saw a few of the girls getting ready for the long camisole nightgown shots. I quickly asked where Stacy was, and they pointed back towards the dressing room. I thanked them and headed back. Stacy was in the midst of changing from one nightgown to another. She was clad only in her bra and panties. I halted abruptly as I came in. ""Oh hey,"" she said looking up at me. All I could do was stare; she was gorgeous! I don\'t know how a few days ago I could\'ve thought she was pudgy.\n\n""What?” she asked, noticing my obvious pause. ""A little body envy, or cat got your tongue? Don\'t worry, I think yours is just as nice.""\n\n""Sorry,"" I said. ""If you want I\'ll come back when you’re finished.""\n\n""No, it\'s fine,"" she said. ""Well,"" she paused, reaching over to the dressing table and pulling a blue silky garment from it. “Take off those street clothes and try this on,"" she said as she tossed the article. \n\nI looked at it. It was an older style nightgown (obviously the one she had told me about). Hesitantly, I pulled my shirt over my head and started to turn my skirt around to get to the zipper. \n\n""Here,"" she said. ""Let me help you with that,"" as she grabbed the zipper on the back of my skirt, gently pulling it down. The skirt fluttered to the floor revealing my slip underneath. She looked at me with an exacting stare. ""Yes, definitely a body that could model,"" she said, giving me a playful swipe on the shoulders. I pulled up the slip, grabbing the hem, and pulled it over my head, still wondering at the silky caress of it as it brushed over my nylons and soft female skin as it came off. \n\n""There you go,"" she said. ""Oh, I like that bra and panty set. I have one similar but in red. Here,"" she said handing me the nightgown again from where I had set it on the chair. I delicately bunched the material up and put it over my head, inserting my hands through the spaghetti straps and letting it flow down over my body.\n\nIt was extremely soft, maybe even softer than my slip. It came down to my ankles with delicate lace on the bodice and hem. It was sky blue with a silky luster. \n\n""What was the material again?"" I asked.\n\n""I believe it was a poly-spandex and nylon blend,"" she said, reaching out to rub a fold on the skirt of the nightgown between her fingers. I swished back and forth and did a half-twirl, feeling the way the soft material caressed my curves and flowed over my nylon clad legs. For a nightgown without cups, it actually had fairly good coverage over my breasts. I liked it.\n\n""Well?"" Stacy asked. ""What do you think?""\n\n""I like it,"" I replied. ""Who designed it?"" I asked. \n\n""It was one of Helen\'s. She worked here before you, she went on leave and it had a few kinks so it never made it to the production line. You would know better than I what she said regarding revision plans. She gave me this one to try on and give her a gauge for how it felt. Before she left she told me to keep it and let her predecessor work with it; that she had other fish to fry now.""\n\n""I see, well I might have to borrow it sometime. I really do like the design,"" I said.\n\n""I will see her later this week and let her know and double check,"" Stacy said smiling. “I\'m sure she wouldn\'t mind helping out a girlfriend of mine.""\n\n""Sounds good,"" I said. ""I need to be getting back over to the office, I have to check in with Karen soon.""\n\nI reach down and gathered the hem and pulled the nightgown up and tried to pull it over my head. The back shoulder straps tangled slightly with my bra and I had trouble extracting it. Stacy embraced me and reached around behind to untangle it. The nightgown came away, and I again felt the feeling I felt this morning as our breasts pressed together, this time only clad in our panties and bras. We were left looking into each other’s eyes. \n\nThere was a pregnant pause and Stacy softly asked, ""May I?"" I had an idea what she was asking as I nodded yes, but it still surprised me as she gently pressed her lips against mine. As I felt her soft, moist lips press against mine, I tasted cherry. Stacy was kissing me! I closed my eyes and gave in, kissing her back. I slightly opened my mouth, flicking my tongue out to play with hers. She reciprocated and we continued for a little bit before we suddenly remembered where we were and pulled away.\n\n""Well,"" I said awkwardly. ""That is some good cherry lip gloss! The lips attached to it aren\'t that bad either. I should be getting back before I\'m missed.""\n\nShe smiled deviously, licking her lips. Hurriedly, I pulled up my slip and slid my shirt over my head adjusting it into place over my breasts and bra. I then slid my skirt back on. Stacy reached behind me and gently zipped it up for me while lightly patting my butt as she did so. \n\n""Thanks,"" I said, reciprocating the gesture before pulling up my skirt to adjust and straighten my slip. We headed for the door and stopped before opening it.\n\n""Elsa,"" Stacy said. ""You won\'t mention this, will you? Some of the girls we work with might not understand. Don\'t get me wrong, whenever I see you at work I wish you were my girlfriend, but I\'m not sure how it would be accepted."" A slight shudder passed through me like I had felt when she wished for me to know what it felt like to wear what I made.\n\n""Don\'t worry, it\'s safe with me,"" I answered. \n\n“Good,” she said before leaning in and kissing me again. We broke the kiss and I smiled and ducked out the door. Later that day, I was looking through my purse and found a picture and note from Stacy; the note was apparently a few months old by the crease lines and had evidence of being read and re-read. The note said:\n\n*""Dear Elsa,*\n\n*I\'m so glad that you could confide in me, at the time I was a bit shocked, but not for the reason you think. You see I like you and am attracted to women and men. I didn\'t know how to tell you that then, or that I am attracted to you. Your eyes, the way you smile, the way you talk (you’re always too witty), even the way you dress. You know how to put yourself together. The way you listen to my ideas and seek out my input makes me feel special. I could go on but really that\'s best left for in person in the late hours of the night, that is, if you would say yes to becoming my girlfriend. I know it\'s a big step. It would be best to keep it quiet for a while, I think, so we can feel things out.*\n\n*Find me after work and we will go from there.*\n\n*With Love,*\n\n*Stacy""*\n\nOnce more in shock, I sat back hard in my chair. So, it appeared that now Stacy and I are and had been girlfriends for more than a little bit. Thinking back, I remembered her wish just after the kiss. What was causing this? How did she have this power over me?\n\nI was distracted from the thought when Stacy knocked on my door. “You ready to go, hon?"" she asked.\n\n""Give me a second, Stac,"" I said. She looked down the hall before walking over and saw the note in my hand.\n\n""Ah,"" She said. ""Reminiscing are we?"" as she gently massaged my shoulders before leaning down and giving me a light kiss. ""Now hurry up so there can be more of that. Remember you’re coming over to my place tonight.""\n\n""Okay, okay,"" I said, feeling my body responding to her. I packed up my stuff quickly and we headed for the door. Walking down the hall she asked what I felt like for dinner as she pushed open the door.\n\n“Maybe Chinese,” I said, stepping through. The tingly feeling and fuzzy vision happened, and everything changed again. \n\nComing out of my daze I heard Stacy say, ""You know, Chinese doesn\'t sound that bad tonight. I might do that myself. You’re not so bad after you get over how blunt you can be sometimes. See you tomorrow."" I could have wept. I trudged to my car and watched as Stacy drove away. Now that feeling I had this time yesterday was definitely leaning on the opposite end. Maybe it was hormones, but I would go to the ends of the earth to stay with her. The problem was that Stacy seemed to have fallen for the woman me, and she was the only one who seemed to have the power to change me, and she didn\'t even realize it.\n\nThe next couple days I was subjected to office work and didn’t see Stacy much except for in passing. Each day going in, my clothes transformed along with my body to their female equivalent, either skirt or dress with the accompanying pantyhose. On Friday I began to get curious on what would happen if I wore an outfit other than business clothes. It being casual Friday I decided to wear a nice T-shirt and my nicer jeans. I also packed a backpack with a set of khakis and a dress shirt in case something I wore ended up being too revealing. \n\nAs I walked through the door I felt my body transform, my angles disappearing and feminine curves coming back out and my breasts swelling. Then I watched as my clothes transformed from jeans material to a silky floral print. The garment then ascended up my legs forming into a tight little skirt that came down four inches above my knees with a cute one-inch lace trim at the hem. Beneath it I could feel the normal slide of panties and slip, only this time I realized it was a micro half-slip. My T-shirt, I realized, was now a black lacy halter top.\n\nAt that point, Stacy walked in and she let out a low wolf whistle. She walked up to me and whispered in my ear, “Girl, you make me feel like a woman.”\n\n*Yeah*, I thought to myself, *I definitely do.*\n\n“I really like that skirt,” she said. “Although, its kind of daring wearing it into work, I would say, but knowing Karen she\'ll like it.”\n\n“Yeah,” I said. “It definitely is a cute outfit.”\n\n“So,” she asks, “You have any plans for the weekend yet? I know we talked a little but hadn’t nailed anything down yet. One of the other girls mentioned a thing tonight if you want to go out. They are heading to this new place over off Fourth and Main. They have pretty good drinks and it\'s kind of low-key.” I told her I would like to, and I would let her know later that day. \n\nWith that, I headed to my office. Designs were progressing fairly well; I had one of the full slips designed and was partway through the half-slips. The designs were set to go out to the seamstress that day so that next week sometime we could get an idea of how it looked. I was kind of excited; this would be my first set of women\'s lingerie. I had not only designed it, but I was able to input my knowledge as a woman and be able to wear it too. \n\nAt the end of the day as I left, I so wished the curse or blessing or whatever it was would extend for just one more day and I would not be reverted back. \n\nStacy caught up to me as I was about to leave so she asked, “Did you decide? You didn’t text me about it. I was kind of looking forward to it as we haven’t spent much time together yet as a couple, even if it is private.”\n\nWithout thinking I said, “Yes, I would love to and I wish we could too.” That’s when we waked through the door. I felt the familiar tingle of changing, but also the one that I associated with Stacy making a wish, and everything went fuzzy. \n\nWhen it stopped, Stacy was in front of me and my mind was in a mental fog. “Hun, are you ok?” she asked.\n\n“I think so,” I said looking down. I realized I was still dressed as a woman, however, I felt different. I felt parts of me that were definitely male, but I also felt feminine still. I could feel my old friend securely between my legs, but also a bra cradling my chest.\n\n“What happened to me? Why I am dressed like this?” I asked, still in a bit of a fog. \n\n“Hun, you’re gender fluid, you dress like this about half your time. I don’t understand it, but you do make an attractive woman, and man. It’s one of the things I love about you. You are both for me. You happen to be female today, Elsa, and if we don’t hurry our pretty little butts up, we’re going to be late. The rest of the girls will be waiting at the club for us.” Realization swept over me. My wish had been granted, I was with Stacy outside of work, and not only that, but now I had both worlds.\n\nI looked around for my car but didn’t see it. “Uhh, Stacy where is my car?” I asked.\n\n“You silly, did you hit your head or something coming out?” she asked, giving it a kiss and turning my face to look at her. “We haven’t driven separate since we moved in together five months ago.”\n\n\n\nAll the best, Becky xoxox', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': ""Story I started a while back but didn't finish until this year."", 'created': 1586396371.0}"

2020-04-11 13:52:52,fz5oqe,0,1,"Hi, I'm non-binary, or at least I think so. Lately I'm thinking my gender is more fluid than I thought. At first I thought ""oh, I'm sure everyone has more male and more female days, it's just a different mood"". Then I thought ""maybe I shift slightly back and fourth"", and then within the last week I was super female and couldn't really ignore that.  


It's difficult for me because it feels like the ground is shifting below my feet. The things I expect to enjoy might not be enjoyable, depending on the day. I get my bearings and start to do certain habits and then suddenly I want to do different things.  


And also, after I had been really female but then stopped feeling so female, I was longing for it.  I found myself wishing for that even though the dysphoria wasn't fun. It was like that was at least validation that I'm trans. Do any of y'all know of people being genderfluid but wishing for a gender that they aren't currently?  


Additionally, I think part of this is me not being 100% okay with it. I'm good with being non-binary and confident in that, not blaming myself if someone can't handle they/them pronouns, etc. I think I have internal fear of being gender fluid though. Worrying about if, in the future, I need to change pronouns. If I change pronouns depending on the day I'm afraid it's going to be very inconvenient and stressful.

2020-04-13 08:55:47,g0f97k,16,7,"So I was pretty sure I'm genderfluid, however...

A lot of times people describe their gender fluidity as what sounds like a switch being turned off and on. I see this example a lot ""I'll wake up in the morning as a woman, put on a cute outfit, walk out the door and suddenly I'm uncomfortable cause I'm a man in a skirt.""

For me, I've never felt like that. When it comes to the idea of gender (and I admit I absolutely have fragmented and damaged pieces of my psyche that might contribute to that), I can't ever really firmly say ""I feel like a man"" or ""I feel like a woman"" or ""I feel like A or B.""

I feel like... I'm me. That's all I can describe it as. 

I have times where I absolutely present as a woman and think in a way as a woman in terms of social, sexual, clothing and other avenues. There are other times where I feel masculine, and start thinking in different ways,  in terms of social, sexual etc. 

I never learned any of those hard lines of demarcation in terms of expression. I can't use makeup past extremely elementary basics. Because of a physical condition I do sprout longer hairs on the underside of my neck and sometimes I let these grow out just because it makes me more comfortable when my masculine side gets more prevalent.

But I don't know if that's the literal term of genderfluid, or if I'm just something else that enjoys wearing men and women's clothing. I thought I had an identity but I don't feel like so many other people describe it as so, call it a mild identity crisis.

If I'm not GF, any idea what I could be?

I'm Gender Fluid NB and at age 62.  I came out to my wife about 28 months ago, as well as sharing my real sexual orientation as fully bisexual (and experienced)  .  It's been a struggle but we're making a go of it.  We have about 3 couples who also know and have been supportive. But a big hurdle was getting to the point of telling our children (F21; F17), who are both around the house pretty much full-time right now.  We'd been talking about it for well over a year and trying to figure out when.  Friday night I pulled the band-aid off!!

On Friday night I came out to my two girls!!!  YES!  And it went well.  They  were surprised, but not super surprised. And both acknowledged that they  had been feeling like there was something going on with me for a while  and this obviously confirmed it. My wife was there and she shared some of her feelings and experiences of  supporting and coming to accept me for who I am- my authentic self. My  wife assured my daughters that while it may take time, it is worthwhile  because we have rebuilt our relationship. I was so happy and it was emotional for all of us too.  At one point after I  shared the news and we were just talking on and off, my younger daughter  (17) asked me what name would I like to be called!  Amazing that she  did that. And I told her that at least for now I'd like them to call me Dad and/or ""gender neutral name"" that helps to bridge the transition to my true self.  At some point I'll let them know what my feminine name is- it's an easier derivative of my birth name so I expect they'll be able to move easily between the three names- masculine, gender queer and female.

We all talked about if my daughters might want to tell their boyfriends,  or not.  Tell their close personal friends or not. And even to expect  and be ready for it to eventually come back to them through 3rd parties  because it's inevitable that at some point, when I'm out and about as my feminine self people who ""know"" me will see me and the ""news"" will spread and take over our ability to be measured about  sharing it.   
    
I feel pretty confident that there  will be no back-tracking on how they react and act toward me now.  At least I don't think that will be the case though.

So I've been going over my gender identity over the past few days, again, after the final prospect of getting to go on HRT in my life. For the record I'm male, body wise, since that's probably an important factor going in. I'm just questioning if there are other people like me here and what you identify as, and maybe how you came around?

I thought I was just neutral on gender for a while, in regards to myself, and I really don't have any preference for pronouns at all. I do realize I hate being always considered a man no matter what, and hate how masculine my body looks. After a lot of looking inward I realized my ideal body is (probably) possible, I just haven't ever met anyone feeling the same thing

I want to look androgynous, is probably the best terms. I always wear comfy clothes to me so those are fairly neutral looking on their own. I love the idea of being able to have boobs, but wear a binder some days when I'm not feeling them. I want to look cute, but almost tomboyish in a way. I still would like my downstairs area to function (which I know is possible on HRT). I'd be willing to answer anything else but that's all I can think of atm

I've just never met anyone out there who describes wanting to be like this/look like this. Finding a term for it (or what people like me would call it) would help me do soul-searching but if I knew the term I probably wouldn't be asking here. I've met just about everyone on the spectrum of genders (my line of work makes that easy, along with my new living area) but still, learn new stuff all the time.

As a reaction to this I have always tried to be perceived as masculine/straight for the sake of being “normal,” so I wouldn’t get bullied. 

I’ve also been trying to cover up the feminine personality traits so everything lines up with what I’m expected to be so I also wouldn’t get bullied. 

It was like a survival mechanism. If I ever noticed an ounce of femininity or not straightness I would go into a depressive anxious episode for days until I repressed the initial feeling or found a way to rationalize it with the straight male narrative.

Same with if I found myself to not be as masculine/“normal” as my Peers, I would go into a depressive episode until I bullied myself into repressing everything and doing something to become more masculine.

To sum this up I’ve repressed myself so much I haven’t had time or energy as a kid/teenager to go through the process of finding out what gender/sexuality I am.

2020-04-16 03:56:44,g27lv5,5,8,"Hey all!

I've been checking in here and there on how genderfluid is talked about in the media and I haven't been pleased for a while. I noticed a spike of ""Look at this genderfluid celebrity!"" only to see that they're genderqueer or non-binary. I've seen very limited articles that use the terms ""genderfluid"" and ""genderfluidity"" properly. It's also being misused in LGBTQ+ spaces for some reason. The term genderfluid is essentially becoming a blanket term meaning gender non-conforming. For example, ""This person's fashion is so genderfluid! What an icon!"" when they are genderqueer and just like to use comfortable clothes from both extremes of the gender binary. 

In my opinion, it makes the community look like a phase or fashion statement rather than a community full of people with struggles. I've read your stories, I've seen the struggles and I've lived through them myself! It just fills me with rage seeing our label used so trivially by people who don't understand it. The same way that some FTM and MTF trans people hate being called ""a trans"" or their clothes referred to as ""trans fashion"" because it trivializes their struggle, I'm of the thought that the term genderfluid should be used more tactfully than it is.

For the past couple of months I have been dealing with these thoughts that I might be Genderfluid. Mainly because have a desire to be feminine and look and be feminine and consider my style very girly girlish but I also enjoy being masculine and enjoy the feeling it gives me. I enjoy both feelings and wish somedays I could have the body shape of the opposite sex but then also love the body I have too. 

Sometimes I want to be the pretty princess and sometime I want to be the handsome prince. 

However it has been very hard for me. At times I feel like I can't accept it. Like ""I was born this gender I am this gender"" (I am friends with a trans guy I am not transphobic or hate people who are Genderfluid. You do you. I am just afraid because I feel like I don't understand myself and am in denial) I am afraid to talk to therapists about it.

I am in a relationship with the girl of my dreams. I love her with all my heart and I am afraid with telling her this that I will loose her. I can't afford to loose her. I know she is only into masculine traits and has told me she is not attractive to feminine traits. Telling her that I feel like I am both male and female might make her not like me anymore.

When the quarantine started his work altered his schedule to 8hrs 5 days a week instead. This is where things changed the most for me and is weighing on me mentally and causing gender dysphoria.

I don't know what I want from this thing I'm writing, a community, some validation, some sense that there will be people who care about me? It's hard for me to understand what I'm going through because I've come to realize I'm still recovering for trauma caused by abandonment and an emotionally abusive dad, but you know the ice breaker ""what's ur daddy issue,"" (joke). This trauma leaves me either emotionally numb with a smile or overwhelmed with pain and tears that leave me confused with questions. 

I find it especially hard to express what I feel in words without getting poetic and metaphorical. That can be frustrating when I can't be direct with what I feel. I guess that's why I'm naturally a visual/performance artist. But how do I talk about the knots of thought trapped inside me like something erosive? 

I read and listened about gender dysmorphia and sexual orientation but how does that work with someone gender fluid? Does being gender fluid make someone gay and straight at the same time? Well hypothetically let's think about it in terms of who I find attractive, if anyone, I'm also asexual. I have a preference to masq./ androgynous looking ppl if I spend enough time with them as friends and suddenly get a cursed crush (it's never been a good thing). That's how I observed my attraction. Now if I'm fluid then I get stuck. I'm seen as a woman, barf I kinda hate the word. So I could be straight when I feel femme but there are times when I feel masq too. Would that not be seen gay if I feel masq? I sometimes think being non binary could be a mood for me too but I don't think I'm fully that either, plus I do love when the flea market ppl give me a good price for being cute looking.

I wanted to be a boy when I was a kid, I cut my hair at 5 and had to get it shaved. I looked like a little boy and I think I actually was happy, despite feeling guilty for making my mom sad. It was cut for our visit to the family in Peru and before it was a cute bob. The rare times I played with barbies they were lesbians and one was a cannibal. I liked playing with boy toys like bionicles and pokemon. I liked roleplaying as males when I was playing pretend with kids.

When I got my period I didn't tell my mom and felt so much shame despite that I love my mom and she's supportive of me. I felt so gross about my body like my vagina bleeding blobs of tissue that I could feel coming out, I felt violated by my body. On top of having to wear something that felt like a plastic diaper. My mom had to ask me if I got my period after free bleeding for days and I cried so much after she asked. My mom told me it's okay and natural, and it is but at the same time it didn't feel like that. I just try not to think about it now a days even if it makes me feel so gassy and bloated. I hate it.

I have a few trans friends who want top surgery which I fully want that for them, but this unfortunately has lead to some discussion about my breast. I get it mine are tiny and I'm ""lucky,"" but am I? They don't give me pain, but I dont like the sacks when they squish together or sweat. I look in the mirror and they feel big to me even if they're small. I actually prefer when my chest looks flatter anyways. I wonder if binding would make me feel happy on some days? I wish my tits weren't looked at. An old lady looked at them when it was summer and I felt a little violated. I told the friends, the ones mentioned above, and I don't think they got how uncomfortable I was. It got dismissed with well Christian old ppl go in that area. It would be nice if my chest stayed the same as a child I felt better. But maybe I do like my chest on some days?

One time I was eleven watching Narnia: Prince Caspian with my older brother and mom. A woman was giving birth and my brother told me one day that's going to be me. I felt violated by that comment. Even at the age of five I've felt certain I don't want children or rather give birth and be called a mother. I don't even like being called a motherly figure today. I will take care of children but I'm not a mother. 

Idk what I am, if I'm just a privileged straight asexual woman, as everyone refers to me, or something far complex? I do like wearing dresses on some days but sometimes I like to look like some creature inspired skater boy. Or sometimes I just like to be a creature. I feel more creature than anything.

2020-04-19 21:51:41,g4g7p5,8,1,"Hey. I'm Andi, AMAB.

Theres a lot to go over here, so bear with me, but the basic premise is that I realized i was fluid 3 days ago and my entire identiy collapsed, and i cant seem to do anything but think on how to fix it.

So, before all this, i was pretty conservative. I wont go into details, but i will tell you that i scoffed at the idea of gender fluidity.

&amp;#x200B;

For the person who doesn't want a Long story about my life, just go to the TL;DR at the end of the text wall.

&amp;#x200B;

So, to explain why I was questionning at 38 years old, you need to understand my life :

Until 7\~8 y.o I have been under the care of only my loving and accepting mom.

I haved clues from my early childhood I wasn't cis,

(Loving Girl toys, identified myself as one of my sister barbies, hiding in a huge family closet to try my older sister wardrobe,etc ).

But after my early childhood (so after 7 \~8) my environment has changed to an homophobic and transphobic environment.

And at some point (during teen years) a very traumatic experiences (that I'm not wanting to talk publicly) had make me hide to me this part of my memories or dismiss the importance some part haved to me.

I don't only forget the trauma, I forgot or dismiss also happy memories.

I come to a friendly and smart child to an problematic high schooler with struggling.

It's only my first wake up in an hospital, after a suicidal attempt, when I was young adults, than I have seen a psychiatrist for a serious business.

I have been diagnosed of chronical depression with clinical episodes.

That took me years to find a psychologist I was comfortable with, And years before I feel better about myself.

I have accepted my bisexuality and found me a wife during this years.

I have continue to work on myself because I was always struggling with depressive episodes.

And as I was feeling better about myself, this last years,

My mind found, after somebody make an insignificant remark about my ""womanly"" side, the time to making think again and again at this sentence during several day.

And at one time, I was doing something else : and all came back.

I lived 3 horrible day after that. All this memory flooding cause me a monstruous amount of anxiety. After 3 day I have been better, and I was OK with most of this memory.(have to work on some of the traumatic memories)

It was a few month ago : since then I have been hit by wave of dysphoria. (Strong one) and discover gender euphoria.

The thing is : since my feelings about my Agab is extremely variable from day to day.

I was questionning ""Am I fluid or it's just dysphoria being variable and I am MtF?""

This is a very important question because I'm happily married to an heterosexual woman.And my usual psychologist has been gone to a break.

So I ask to a psychiatrist in the free psychological support system in France if I can see a specialized therapist.Just after : the lockdown has started.

I learn 2\~3 days ago , After searching on internet that it was not a specialized psychologist, but a Freudian therapist i was send to....(they still exist in France)

So yes, I have to learn by myself how to handle dysphoria.

As I feel okay, with my AGAB a good part of the times, I have decided to identify myself as a Genderfluid person.And I thinks, it's the better way to handle dysphoria when I'm feeling that I am a woman.

TLDR : I'm Dysphoric, but because I'm ok most of the times, I have decided to identify myself as genderfluid.

Sorry, I Feel like this is like a second coming out (because, I'm not ready to talk of that with someone else than my wife at the moment, even if I'm publicly out as Bisexual).

And sorry for the text wall : I needed this.

That said, when I was a kid in the 80's I was taught that using 'they' or 'them' when referring to a single individual is rude, and after more than 30 years, that is a difficult habit to break; as I've gone back and proofread this post before submitting, there's a bunch of places where I've had to go back and change a pronoun to 'they' since it isn't really coming naturally.

And since I myself am not genderfluid, I realize that I'm not necessarily a good judge on whether it is or not.

In the story, the main character and this character go to a school with set male and female uniforms. For the two or three months that they've known each other, this character has been portraying themselves as a cisgender male, explaining that they went with it because 'I'm fine with the pants with whichever gender I feel like, but the skirt would feel really awkward when I feel like a boy'. Once he finds out that his classmate is genderfluid, and explaining that using 'they' and 'them' at least feels rude to him, the main character makes the suggestion, 'would you be alright if I call you he and him when you come to school in the boy's uniform, and call you she and her when you come to school in the girl's uniform? Then use they or them when I haven't seen you yet that day.'

I'll use 'they' and 'them' the whole way if this is a bad idea - I can even turn it into a minor plot point in that case by having them respond 'no, that's not alright with me' - again, I'm just trying to be actually respectful while also trying not to feel rude, either.",genderfluid,Writing a story and one of the characters is supposed to be genderfluid; trying to be respectful in my use of pronouns,1587550278.0,"{'created_utc': 1587525078, 'id': 'g5tktd', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""There's a story I've been working on for myself for a while, and in it, there is a character where it seems like the best fit for describing them is genderfluid, in that sometimes they identify as a boy and sometimes they identify as a girl (and please, if I'm already messing up in describing them that way, please, let me know), and I'm getting to where I'm starting to try brainstorming their role in the story more deeply than just, 'here is a brief description of the character.'\n\nThat said, when I was a kid in the 80's I was taught that using 'they' or 'them' when referring to a single individual is rude, and after more than 30 years, that is a difficult habit to break; as I've gone back and proofread this post before submitting, there's a bunch of places where I've had to go back and change a pronoun to 'they' since it isn't really coming naturally.

So I'm less then a year of finally accepting that in genderfuild and well... I have desiring to be able to express more of my feminine side in reality out side of doing nails and minor makeup. I would like to get some clothes but..  in all honesty, if y'all saw me as I am now I would look like the farthest thing from genderfuild.

2020-04-23 11:25:23,g6kxw4,5,1,"I am genderfluid. My gender changes sporadically with time. I do not experience dysphoria, and dysmorphia is relatively minimal. I feel as though I'm cheating the community by being in so comparatively little suffering, but that's a different topic altogether.
What I want to focus on currently is that I am young and genderfluid. To clarify, I am 100% sure I am genderfluid and have experienced multiple cycles, even being enby for some time. I am a young male in sex, and I am very very masculine. A lot of hair I don't want on me, I am probably over 6 feet yet I am only 13, considerable facial hair and an ever deepening voice. I am currently a male, yet I still believe I need to not become anymore masculine if I am ever to be comfortably feminine.

The problem is that I can't get puberty blockers without parental approval in my country (minimum age is 18, at which point puberty is over, so why the fuck would anyone need them at that point) and my parents are extremely transphobic and also in a very transphobic country, so I'm stuck.
I am scared to not take something or find something to help me stay more androgynous, even without dysphoria, living as a masculine man when I am actually a female can be.. disheartening, to say the least. It feels disgusting and.. unwanted. I want to be myself but I can't, I'm stuck, and I will be for the rest of my life I assume if nothing is done early.
Since I am not transgender, I cannot get away with asking for medication that way by getting diagnosed to have dysphoria and given the right things to help treat it.

What can I do? What is safe to do and how can I do it? There perhaps may be nothing, especially considering my parents are literally never going to change their minds on this matter. Please do not suggest I try it because they might change their perspective seeing their child is like this, you'd be literally suggesting I ruin my life.
For some more context, I am a guy right now, so this isn't something I'd regret as a guy because I'm more than happy with my masculinity, in fact, I'm so happy with it, I fucking hate it still. And would much rather I was more feminine even as a guy, though not that much, think of it as an anime trap, I can look like a feminine guy wearing masculine clothing, but can also pass off as female or androgynous wearing different clothing and potentially make-up. That's the ideal thing that would fix all my problems with gender as soon as I became independent, I'm not aiming for that exactly, any compromise will do if it means saving myself from.. a triggering lifestyle, if I may put it like that. Puberty blockers would be ideal if there's some magic way to obtain them, or there's something that's been tested to work as them or achieves something similar.

2020-04-26 05:42:07,g890i2,0,1,"Hey r/genderfluid

As I type this, I will admit I am feeling a little turned on as I begin to think about describing my sexuality to you. Yes, I am a biological female and I am interested in men but today I've finally been able to fully realize why I never felt comfortable with the label ""heterosexual."" 

You might wonder, why the hell do I not identify with being ""straight."" And yes, I don't identify with being straight even though I like men. Here's why: I don't see the men that I am attracted to as ""men."" I see more than a specific ""gender."" I see them as a person and a unique human being. Yes, they present as ""masculine,"" and I am attracted to that but I am also attracted to men who are ""feminine"" presenting as well. So I realized that it's not necessarily about me being into a ""man that's a man"" because he could be masculine (beard, muscles, etc.) and I would like him and he could also be feminine presenting and I would also like him. But, that example was meant to be more explanatory than anything. That is to say, I am most attracted to him if he was both masculine and feminine presenting in different ways. 

To give you an example, I am highly attracted to male musicians, specifically singer-songwriters: he sings and plays an instrument like the guitar. A huge turn-on for me! I find music, musicianship, writing songs, and performing that music a very sensitive and emotional act and when I see a masculine-presenting man doing this it blends the two for me and makes it so that they are not conforming to one specific ""gender."" In my own personal life, I am most attracted to fashion that is both masculine and feminine. I also am most attracted to fashion on men that is also both masculine and feminine (e.g. tight capris on guys) or gender-neutral clothing.   


You may wonder, where all this is coming from? Here are my thoughts. Growing up, I was raised by a very strong mother who divorced my dad and separated from him before I was born so I never really got the opportunity to see the ""mom/dad"" interaction. Instead, my mom was in varying relationships all my life with ""masculine-presenting"" women. The majority of these relationships were abusive and traumatic for both my mom and two older brothers in various ways. My mom's family disagreed with her relationships with women and identifying as a ""gay woman/lesbian."" They even told me that I would turn out gay because this is what I was exposed to and I subconsciously ended up believing them. I look back to pictures of myself in elementary school and see how I looked as if I was dressing more gender-neutral/masculine. When I think back on that, I did that because I looked up to one woman that my mom was in a relationship with and admired her, so I thought I would imitate some of her mannerisms and ended up dressing in a more masculine fashion. I also had some experiences with some girls when I was in school that was your typical ""exploring ourselves"" type, but looking back at that today I realize that I was either being swayed by peer-pressure of was using ""unhealthy"" coping mechanisms to deal with my emotions. Because one thing my mom didn't teach me was emotional care because she has her own set of emotional traumatic experiences and struggles that affected how she raised her children. So today, even if I find a female attractive due to something about her like her style or refutation of ""gender-norms"", I think due to my experiences with women and trauma that I went through from some of the women in my life due to my mom's relationships, I don't think I could have a fulfilling relationship with a woman. When thinking about my sexuality and my tendency to not conform to genders, I've asked myself if, in fact, I am gay because I identify with masculine characteristics as well as feminine characteristics. But even though I find women attractive, I feel that I want to be with a ""man"" sexually. But, as in my earlier commentary, I don't find myself heterosexual because I am more so attracted to the non-conformity and personality of the ""men"" that I am attracted to.   


Lastly, when it comes to sex I have little to no experience because I am a virgin and I haven't experienced my first kiss. So I don't have anything to go off as in what I ""might"" feeling during those experiences. I also haven't been in a romantic relationship with anyone. I have been on dates with people, but nothing has evolved from them. The date that I was most interested in though, was a guy who came off as gender-fluid, having both masculine and feminine traits. Unfortunately, it wasn't able to work out between him and me for other reasons. Based on what turns me on, I would like to have sex with a ""man"" but I don't want my partner to view me as a ""woman"" and sexualize me like a woman during sex, though I want them to be turned on by me by other reasons. Based on my confidence, my enthusiasm, and my unique sexuality.  I want both of us to be gender-non conforming lovers and please each other in non-gender stereotypical ways. For example, I want to dominate my guy and turn him on as if he wasn't a man as if he was just a person with an area that had an ""erogenous zone"" (e.g. penis). I want to ""fuck"" him (e.g. pegging) and I want him to fuck me.   


Growing up, I moved around a lot and so I believe this impacted my cultural influences (I am originally from the Caribbean). I've lived in different states and found myself connecting to people who were always different. As a result, I find myself being most attracted to people who are not of my race, which is Caribbean/Black. Therefore, combining all these things together my type has become"" white, gender non-conforming, musician guy with an interesting personality that resonates with me."" However, don't call me heterosexual because I am not.

Final paragraph. Thank you for reading. Hopefully, you were able to read everything and follow what I was saying. I could probably say more, but it is getting late tonight, and I'd probably save that for later. Lastly, if you are someone who read through this and related to any of what I was saying, I am very thankful. If you want to connect and learn more about me, I would love to connect whether that be in the comments or elsewhere.   
.....................................

I would love to have a friend to discuss sexuality with, and though I don't have anything against women, I would prefer it if it was a guy (despite sexuality). It would be cool to talk about the origins of sexuality, what your sexuality is, and your experiences with sexuality. I'd rather connect on discord than on here, though I don't play games/am a gamer, I like discord the most for chatting. Don't forget to comment below or message me!

So I realized that it\'s not necessarily about me being into a ""man that\'s a man"" because he could be masculine (beard, muscles, etc.) and I would like him and he could also be feminine presenting and I would also like him. But, that example was meant to be more explanatory than anything. That is to say, I am most attracted to him if he was both masculine and feminine presenting in different ways. \n\nTo give you an example, I am highly attracted to male musicians, specifically singer-songwriters: he sings and plays an instrument like the guitar. A huge turn-on for me! I find music, musicianship, writing songs, and performing that music a very sensitive and emotional act and when I see a masculine-presenting man doing this it blends the two for me and makes it so that they are not conforming to one specific ""gender."" In my own personal life, I am most attracted to fashion that is both masculine and feminine. I also am most attracted to fashion on men that is also both masculine and feminine (e.g. tight capris on guys) or gender-neutral clothing.   \n\n\nYou may wonder, where all this is coming from? Here are my thoughts. Growing up, I was raised by a very strong mother who divorced my dad and separated from him before I was born so I never really got the opportunity to see the ""mom/dad"" interaction. Instead, my mom was in varying relationships all my life with ""masculine-presenting"" women. The majority of these relationships were abusive and traumatic for both my mom and two older brothers in various ways. My mom\'s family disagreed with her relationships with women and identifying as a ""gay woman/lesbian."" They even told me that I would turn out gay because this is what I was exposed to and I subconsciously ended up believing them. I look back to pictures of myself in elementary school and see how I looked as if I was dressing more gender-neutral/masculine. When I think back on that, I did that because I looked up to one woman that my mom was in a relationship with and admired her, so I thought I would imitate some of her mannerisms and ended up dressing in a more masculine fashion. I also had some experiences with some girls when I was in school that was your typical ""exploring ourselves"" type, but looking back at that today I realize that I was either being swayed by peer-pressure of was using ""unhealthy"" coping mechanisms to deal with my emotions. Because one thing my mom didn\'t teach me was emotional care because she has her own set of emotional traumatic experiences and struggles that affected how she raised her children. So today, even if I find a female attractive due to something about her like her style or refutation of ""gender-norms"", I think due to my experiences with women and trauma that I went through from some of the women in my life due to my mom\'s relationships, I don\'t think I could have a fulfilling relationship with a woman. When thinking about my sexuality and my tendency to not conform to genders, I\'ve asked myself if, in fact, I am gay because I identify with masculine characteristics as well as feminine characteristics. But even though I find women attractive, I feel that I want to be with a ""man"" sexually. But, as in my earlier commentary, I don\'t find myself heterosexual because I am more so attracted to the non-conformity and personality of the ""men"" that I am attracted to.   \n\n\nLastly, when it comes to sex I have little to no experience because I am a virgin and I haven\'t experienced my first kiss. So I don\'t have anything to go off as in what I ""might"" feeling during those experiences. I also haven\'t been in a romantic relationship with anyone. I have been on dates with people, but nothing has evolved from them. The date that I was most interested in though, was a guy who came off as gender-fluid, having both masculine and feminine traits. Unfortunately, it wasn\'t able to work out between him and me for other reasons. Based on what turns me on, I would like to have sex with a ""man"" but I don\'t want my partner to view me as a ""woman"" and sexualize me like a woman during sex, though I want them to be turned on by me by other reasons. Based on my confidence, my enthusiasm, and my unique sexuality.  I want both of us to be gender-non conforming lovers and please each other in non-gender stereotypical ways. For example, I want to dominate my guy and turn him on as if he wasn\'t a man as if he was just a person with an area that had an ""erogenous zone"" (e.g. penis). I want to ""fuck"" him (e.g. pegging) and I want him to fuck me.   \n\n\nGrowing up, I moved around a lot and so I believe this impacted my cultural influences (I am originally from the Caribbean). I\'ve lived in different states and found myself connecting to people who were always different. As a result, I find myself being most attracted to people who are not of my race, which is Caribbean/Black. Therefore, combining all these things together my type has become"" white, gender non-conforming, musician guy with an interesting personality that resonates with me.""

So basically, as the title says, im confused on the differences between genderfluidity and gender non-conforming. I find that when ever someone tries to explain genderfluidity, they always refer to gender roles and not really fitting in to either one of them.

The thing is that this definition confuses me because, though i know what the gender roles are, i was raised pretty much to ignore them. My mom works a male oriented job and have male oriented interest, but still loves ""girly"" things like nail polish, flowy flowery dresses and makeup. My dad is pretty manly, but he still does most of the cooking, the cleaning, the washing of clothes, basically almost all the things in the house that are considered ""women jobs""  in my community and acts like a stay at home dad. I'm female but as a kid my parents never had a problem with me getting beyblades, transformer toys, bakugans and toy cars along with my dolls and plastic tiaras, provided that the price was reasonable. Hell, just 3 months ago i was looking at suits on amazon because i wanted to wear one to my graduation and my mother loved them so much that i ended up having to buy two. If i wanted to i could go full on butch and my parents wouldn't care (provided i eventually marry a man because they are still pretty homophobic)

What im trying to say in this lengthy post is that, i never felt that not fitting in to gender roles makes anyone less male or female thanks to the way i was raised, so to refer to genderfluidity as ""i don't conform to this gender role or that gender role"" confuses me because to me that just seem like gender non-conforming. I realise that this post is moreso asking ""what is genderfluidity"" than ""the differences between genderfluidity and non-conforming"" but for me its the same question.

Basically I identity as trans fem/nonbinary rn. Not on a full and defined path of transitioning yet either till I figure out what I want exactly which is why I say that.

That all being said, I also want to try branching out and dating for the first time. And any dating or potential relationship would I think be solely with me expressing myself and presenting as a girl. My dating history has only ever been as a guy with girls and it's been years since my last date. The biggest thing is I want to avoid ""chasers"" and what not who tend to go after girls like me only because we satisfy a sexual fetish for them. 

But at the same time I want to properly set expectations on who/what I am so I dont catch anyone off guard since while i try my best to pass as a girl it's clear still I'm not, especially with my voice. 

Is there a specific place I should look, whether in person or online that's good to try and find dates?

I've of course heard ""just be yourself"" but that is already so vague and of course I would but it seems lacking in direction and just leaves me feeling anxious about everything.

So for a little while I've been thinking about doing MTF and I've always found it as something I wanted to do as I've wanted to be a female for a while now, but now I want to have my somewhat masculine self to fall back on sometimes. Like I would still keep my birth name but still go through with HRT. I've read that it won't make me look 100% like a girl so I wanted to use that to my advantage. After a while I would start presenting female and use my female name some days, but other days I would fall back to my somewhat masculine self. It would really all depend on the day and what I feel like doing.

So like, I have a few questions:

Is what I'm experiencing gender dysphoria at all?

Would I consider myself genderfluid based on what I'm experiencing?

Would I even be able to go through HRT if I talk about this in therapy?

2020-04-30 14:05:43,gawa9m,1,1,"So around a month ago I figured out I was trans and wanted to pursue MTF HRT. This was because I wanted to at least look somewhat feminine and wanted to express myself in more ways than just masculine. I wanted to be a girl and wanted to use the pronouns she/her. This was mainly because I felt like him/his had some kind of weight to them and I didn't feel comfortable being masculine. 

Now comes a couple days ago when I wanted to be able to change back and go back and forth to look somewhat feminine one day or masculine another depending on the day. And since I figured out that technically without surgery pursuing HRT I wouldn't look like a completely different person and completely 100% like a female so I thought maybe I could go back and forth after I started it. Like I don't always feel like I should be feminine all day for rest of my life now, and just being my regular masculine self sometimes, again it all depends on how I feel and the day. That's also because I don't feel 100% comfortable with being masculine all the time nor do I feel 100% comfortable being feminine all the time. then again I don't want to be just like in the middle at all and feel like I could just be one or the other sometimes.
