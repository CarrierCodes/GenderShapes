Fast forward and the past couple years I've been considering myself a cis woman, mainly due to some realizations in therapy regarding trauma and wanting to be distant from the girl I grew up being. Well I've had instances of doubts but I ignored them because I had a very bad experience coming out to my parents and I didn't even want to entertain ever coming out (as far as gender) to them ever ever again. Well it all hit me like a wave the other morning and now I realize that I'm definitely genderfluid and this isn't going away. I'm so anxious about it all that I feel like I'm going to lose my mind. To make things even more complicated, I began dating one of my best friends at the end of August and I love him a lot. I told him how I've been feeling and he was very kind about it but I have no idea where this will leave us. I'm just afraid and keep questioning myself and what I know to be true. Partly because I feel I'm disappointing people and partly because I had a therapist that was great with helping me through trauma but very very bad at discussing gender and it made me feel like I wasn't valid and didn't make any sense.

Hey all,

I wanted to get some opinions on language and how it is sexist. I will be shortly creating a video about this topic and I wanted to know how these words make you feel, why is it bad for society, and any ideas on how we could change!! Please feel free to message me or just simply comment below...

So to begin I want to discuss language such as 
Actor / actress 
Waiter / waitress 

Like what is the need for these words in today‚Äôs society? When you can say teacher, doctor, nurse, shop assistant and they are not gendered

And how it stems from Romance languages, and I truly believe these languages are more sexist than English but I could be wrong because I‚Äôm so used to English. For example in French and Spanish, you have a different word for ‚Äúthey‚Äù when they are only women... but you could have 100 women and one man, and the they becomes masculine... pure bonkers if you ask me. Think it‚Äôs routed in Latin and religion tbh but that‚Äôs for another discussion...

So yeah if you have any thoughts you know any examples from Latin languages or other languages please get involved!

2020-11-03 01:14:14,jn0su1,3,1,"Hi all

This is my first post in this sub. The point is that I'm suffering and I'd like to read your opinions since I don't know what I am and what to think anymore and maybe you could give me your point of view. This is my story:

I'm a 35yo male despite I've never really identified with the word ""male"" and everything it involves. When I was a kid I was kinda effeminate and played with the girls till I become a teenager and I forced myself to play with other males in order to ""fit"" and be ""normal"". Adolescence is also when what I perceive as dysphoria started (physical changes were awful, embarassing and uncomfortable AF to me and had to ""learn"" to be treated as a ""man"" by others coz it all felt forced to me). I had (and still do somehow) genital dysphoria despite I have had no issues when having sex and I wasn't waiting for a female puberty or something either.

I must say I was raised in a very abusive family with an awful narcissistic mother and a henpecked father she used against me as a tool all the time. Threats, blackmail, insults and constant invalidation where my everyday life at home. Because I started wanting to not be seen naked my psycho mom got obssessed with that and forced me to get naked in front of them all the time and even forcing me to shower with my dad (nothing sexual happened but I felt totally raped). And when puberty hit she started using sex against me as a tool saying me dirty things to knock me out when she felt powerless against me. Add to that I suffered bullying for some years for playing with girls at school so my childhood was awful since I was abused practically everywhere.

I grew up a beautiful boy and when I was about 20 I started thinking/feeling I would've been happier if I was born female and kept the thinking ""well if I've had to be a boy at least I'm a cute one"". Obviously kept all that feelings in private. When I was about 26 I met my ex and came out as gay. I was with him for almost 7 years. During that time my gender thoughts were there but kinda silenced/dead, only started being intrusive at the end of the relationship (that wasn't the cause at all). After we broke up I went back to my moms (worst mistake ever BTW) and lost my job after a year.

That's when the dysphoria suddenly woke up and ate me. After lots of doubts and pain I decided to try HRT which I was on for 3 months and a half (aprox) till I decided to stop coz I felt weird with the changes (muscle mass loss, breast growth and couldn't even find a female name or talk about me as a ""she""). I changed a lot physically speaking in that short time though, but what surprised me was that I felt fine and ""me"" again when the changes reverted.

Forgot to mention that my idenitity issues where not just about the gender but with the whole me (hobbies, aspirations, goals, jobs, etc). Then after a failed move to another country I came back and found out I have BPD (borderline personality disorder) which BTW involves a lack of identity of self. I've been in HRT for 10 months and my dysphoria which was kinda gone again, came back but this time is kinda different: there are times I'm conviced I'm not trans and thinking about transitioning feels strange and gross, and others where I feel totally wrong and that I'm actually trans. 

The thing is that the gender changes are so heavy that I'm considering that maybe I'm not trans or cis but genderfluid (never thought this actually really existed but now I'm considering it could :S). I have a wig and make up I got when I tried transitioning (for myself, never dressed as a girl in public) and I've tried to use them when I have doubts and there are times it feels wrong, others feel like THAT's the real me but at the same time when I take it all out it also feels me somehow :/

So I don't know if I'm cis but my BPD is affecting my gender identity, if I'm trans and I'm subsconsciously repressing, if the abuse (the sexual above all) I suffered as a child is using this as a escape way or if I'm just gender fluild.

What do you think? BTW thanks for reading this, I'm aware it's a long post but wanted to give some details so you can get a better idea aboive it all.

The point is that I\'m suffering and I\'d like to read your opinions since I don\'t know what I am and what to think anymore and maybe you could give me your point of view. This is my story:\n\nI\'m a 35yo male despite I\'ve never really identified with the word ""male"" and everything it involves. When I was a kid I was kinda effeminate and played with the girls till I become a teenager and I forced myself to play with other males in order to ""fit"" and be ""normal"". Adolescence is also when what I perceive as dysphoria started (physical changes were awful, embarassing and uncomfortable AF to me and had to ""learn"" to be treated as a ""man"" by others coz it all felt forced to me). I had (and still do somehow) genital dysphoria despite I have had no issues when having sex and I wasn\'t waiting for a female puberty or something either.\n\nI must say I was raised in a very abusive family with an awful narcissistic mother and a henpecked father she used against me as a tool all the time. Threats, blackmail, insults and constant invalidation where my everyday life at home. Because I started wanting to not be seen naked my psycho mom got obssessed with that and forced me to get naked in front of them all the time and even forcing me to shower with my dad (nothing sexual happened but I felt totally raped). And when puberty hit she started using sex against me as a tool saying me dirty things to knock me out when she felt powerless against me. Add to that I suffered bullying for some years for playing with girls at school so my childhood was awful since I was abused practically everywhere.\n\nI grew up a beautiful boy and when I was about 20 I started thinking/feeling I would\'ve been happier if I was born female and kept the thinking ""well if I\'ve had to be a boy at least I\'m a cute one"". Obviously kept all that feelings in private. When I was about 26 I met my ex and came out as gay. I was with him for almost 7 years. During that time my gender thoughts were there but kinda silenced/dead, only started being intrusive at the end of the relationship (that wasn\'t the cause at all). After we broke up I went back to my moms (worst mistake ever BTW) and lost my job after a year.\n\nThat\'s when the dysphoria suddenly woke up and ate me. After lots of doubts and pain I decided to try HRT which I was on for 3 months and a half (aprox) till I decided to stop coz I felt weird with the changes (muscle mass loss, breast growth and couldn\'t even find a female name or talk about me as a ""she""). I changed a lot physically speaking in that short time though, but what surprised me was that I felt fine and ""me"" again when the changes reverted.\n\nForgot to mention that my idenitity issues where not just about the gender but with the whole me (hobbies, aspirations, goals, jobs, etc). Then after a failed move to another country I came back and found out I have BPD (borderline personality disorder) which BTW involves a lack of identity of self. I\'ve been in HRT for 10 months and my dysphoria which was kinda gone again, came back but this time is kinda different: there are times I\'m conviced I\'m not trans and thinking about transitioning feels strange and gross, and others where I feel totally wrong and that I\'m actually trans. \n\nThe thing is that the gender changes are so heavy that I\'m considering that maybe I\'m not trans or cis but genderfluid (never thought this actually really existed but now I\'m considering it could :S).

2020-11-07 14:55:36,jps5az,5,1,"Hi everyone,
This is one of my first posts on reddit, and I guess it is a bit of a big one as it is me trying to figure out if I fall under being Genderfluid or something different in relation to my gender. It's a bit of a long one, so apologies for that. 

I am 25 years old, and since I was 19 have been dressing up (occasionally) in girls clothing in the privacy of my bedroom at home. For a long while (until about May of this year), I only dressed up in lingerie-esque clothing maybe once, twice, or several times a month. But since around April, I have been dressing up nearly every other day in femme clothing. 

This has been made easier to do by meeting my current girlfriend who has donate a lot of her clothes to me and supports me dressing up. Before her, nobody in my real life knew that I dressed up. Now a small selection do, including her friends and the people in my current flat I am living in at uni. Because I feel less pressured to hide myself away when dressed up, I have felt a lot of freedom and feel more at ease and encouraged to do so. 

This hasn't been something that has only developed since I was about 19 either. At around 10 years old, I dressed up in a one piece swim suit in privacy, and on a couple of occasions in tights and skirts that belonged to members of my family. I have always loved women's clothing and sometimes used to picture myself in them.

But it isn't just about dressing up in girls clothing. I would say since an even younger age, I haven't really fit the 'norms' of masculinity, and have occassionally been teased for being soft, sensitive, and/or overly affectionate by friends and past partners. Until more recently, I just saw it as a product of being submissive, shy, and anxious in nature, but have more recently considered that deep down, I feel more femme than masculine at times. Not all the time, just now and then. 

A lot of my confusion comes from the fact that I can't necessarily distinguish in myself when I feel 'fem', and when I feel 'masculine', (or my version of masculine, which isnt very masculine in many ways I don't think). It isn't very black or white in my head, there seems to be a lot of overlap and grey areas, and I feel like it sometimes even depends on the setting I'm in and the people I am around. (usually feeling more masculine around men who are acting boisterous; and more femme around relationship partners and girls who are friends). Therefore, I sometimes find it hard to know how I identify as if I ask myself the question: ""are you feeling like a girl, or like a boy right now?""

I guess I am quite new to exploring my gender in depth, mainly because I felt a pressure on me to hide it and to repress it, I think. Therefore I am not very clued up on aspects of it, and haven't had a chance to really delve into it.

i am currently carrying out my dissertation (degree project) looking into the experiences of autism and masking, especially in regards to transgender and non-binary individuals. as part of this, i have created a questionnaire to gather responses from as many people as possible. autistic or not, trans/nb or not - you can take part. you must, however, be over the age of 18 due to consent.

the link is below - please take part and share far and wide. it will most likely be open until March 2021 so i'm hoping to gather as many responses as possible for an extensive data collection.

Anyways someone please let me know as well if this breaks any rules cause you all are so nice and so the last thing I want to do is get banned.

So as a little bit of background I discovered mid-high school that I was genderfluid. I don't recall having major dysphoria then, it was more that I started playing around with how I dressed bc there were times it felt ""wrong"" to dress like my gender at birth and then times it felt ""right."" And I felt euphoria for the first time, and it was kind of like opening a can of worms I guess?

Not long after this discovery, I cut my hair (all 12 inches of it) into a pixie cut and kept it that way because it was more versatile. Moving on!

My current boyfriend has told me he would like to see my hair long. I love him to death and want to see him happy, so I originally made a big stink about it but eventually gave in thinking that since I've never really experienced a ton of dysphoria...why would it start now? Turns out, my hair is a direct connection to my identity (who would have thought?) and it's getting worse as it gets longer. I keep telling myself maybe I'm just overthinking it and that all that matters is how I feel and if I just squish it down it will go away...but it's not going away. It's not even to my shoulders yet and maybe that's why, because it's longer but not long enough to put up to look male yet. Hats don't seem to be working, dressing male doesn't seem to either because I just keep looking up and brain is going ""male"" or ""nonbinary"" and my face and hair is going ""female."" and so my brain goes ""what are we?

.... wait..... wasnt there a Term that defines this exactly?

So I'm currently struggling with my gender. My sex is male and most of the time I feel male. But not all the time.

So I'm confused whether or not I'm gender-fluid. To me it gets more confusing because I am somewhat into kink and I'd identify as a switch. So some days I wake up feeling more dom and other days I wake up feeling more sub. But I'm wondering if I've been mislabelling these? Part of my kink tendencies is to wear feminine clothes too. Out of personal shame that I didn't understand at the time, I stopped wearing feminine clothes for a long time and grew a nice beard which helped see myself as male. And it worked for the most part. But I still wake up sometimes and want to use more feminine mannerisms and want to wear something a bit more stylish for guys or even wish I had panties and a dress etc. And other times want to wear all black male clothes and drink beer like it owes me money haha.

So I'm wondering if I actually wake up and feel more feminine sometimes, and other times more masculine? Instead of dom/sub. For the longest time I've associated this with pornography and my sexuality, but maybe it's not?? I feel afraid of showing any fem tendencies socially, that I'll be judged and  called gay or something. And I know I'm straight, which kind of makes it more confusing because so much pornography out there to do with mtf stuff is not straight. But over time I've learnt that that isn't me.

Maybe I'm just a guy who likes to dress up sometimes? Or is waking up and feeling different, and often feeling like I'm 2 people, an indicator that I am gender-fluid?

I'm posting on here so I can get some extra info and insight into the non binary/trans world. I'm not used to much of terminology (cis female here) so I apologise if I cause any offence, I just want to learn more to benefit and support my sibling.

My brother is 14 and we have a really close relationship. He recently came out as gay (bisexual to our dad) and he's always been quite feminine with his interests. He loved playing with dolls (still does in the way of doing their hair and designing their clothes, but he will only play with ones that are the same race as him - mixed raced or black dolls - because he says he relates to them more), loves hair and makeup and has a group of friends that are exclusively girls. Our dad (he's a single dad, their mum isn't in the picture at all) buys his clothing and dresses the boys quite masculine. However, as my brother has hit puberty, he's become interested in shaving off his facial hair and waxing his legs. He has worn fake nails before and liked the look. He wants to buy a long haired wig and wear natural looking make up so he can 'pass' as female. He even said ""if I was trans I don't know what my female name would be"". He's also been talking a lot about the other trans-girl in his class and how she doesn't feel accepted by her parents and isn't exclusively out to her parents. He also asked what bathroom he would use if he was.

I know this doesn't mean his non-binary, he may be trans he may not. But i guess I was looking for more information on

 I'm nonbinary (and genderfluid). I've grown into this knowledge over a couple of years, but there it is.

I'm also known among my friends and family as a fiercely progressive person and ally for LGBT folks of any kind, and most of the people in my life are the same. If I told them this they might be surprised but they would be totally cool about it. And yet, I still hesitate.

1. Part of me looks at my trans friends and acquaintances and I feel I haven't ""earned"" it like they have. They have *suffered*. Their battles with dysphoria have been acute, and dangerous to them. I have mostly just felt a low-grade resentment and depression throughout my adult life that our world demands I be this one thing when I kind of want to be all of it. It's persistent but subtle, not disruptive, and I feel like a poseur for making a thing out of it.
2. I'm old! Well, not that old but I've spent my entire adult life just going about my business as cis as you please and it never occurred to me to consider anything else. I was middle aged before I had the intellectual and emotional smarts to start asking deep questions about myself. It makes me feel very stupid to realize such a thing so comparatively late, which makes it hard to be real with people who don't think that I'm stupid.
3. I'm a devoted martial artist, and the people I train with are very close to me but they wouldn't understand if I started to be open. The folks at my gym are good people, but they are pretty caught up in the dominant paradigm. Nobody would be gross or hateful, but it would change the dynamic and I'm afraid a place that is important to me would soon grow unwelcome.
4. I worry about dating. My last serious gf once, in an attempt to be passive-aggressively insulting, made a big deal about my being feminine. It gave me a lot to think about, because I wasn't as insulted by that as she had wanted me to be, even though it hadn't occurred to me that I *was* feminine before then. It got me thinking, and two years later... But while I have been ok with casual dating, the idea of having a serious partner scares me, especially knowing more about myself now. I worry that, as much as there is a new world opening to me, a whole new life to explore, it's going to be a lonely world and a lonely life.

I feel like I inherited a house many years ago. It was a perfectly nice house, in a neighborhood I like. Maybe it sometimes felt a little cramped, but that's life right? Human means are finite, our desires infinite. Same as it ever was. Well, then one day (let's say after staring at the walls for a year of quarantine) I find a door that I had never seen before. How the hell did I miss that for x decades of life? I enter the door and holy moley there's a whole other half of the house that I've completely ignored the whole time! Thing is, that whole other half is a ruin of neglect and disrepair. To rehab it would require an exhausting amount of work. Is it even worth it? Yes, but my fearful self wants to ignore that much labor. Just let it be. But to do so would be churlish, an act of cosmic ingratitude, because for all that needs doing this is a gift and I'm grateful for it.

2020-11-20 20:16:54,jxwlii,6,1,"Hello, Reddit!

&amp;#x200B;

This post is going to be a rather long and scatter-brained journey into my mind as I recount the parts of my life that has lead me to the question: Am I non-binary / agender / genderqueer / something else outside the gender norm?

&amp;#x200B;

No one should have the time to read all of this and weigh in with their thoughts and opinions on my situation, but if you do, let me say as early as possible that I love you and wish you all the best. I do that even if you don't read or comment, to be honest. I just want you to be happy. Which is what I'm trying to be by figuring this out.

&amp;#x200B;

I am going to use the term ‚Äúnon-binary‚Äù from here on out as it's the one I'm most accustomed to. As stated in the question above, there are others that might fit me, but for the purposes of this post, I'm going to view them as somewhat interchangeable. I know that's not wholly correct. But I hope no one takes offense to me doing so for simplicity's sake here.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**

I'm 26yo, AMAB. I grew up as hetero and cis by default. I've always had a lot of cis girls as friends, never been stereotypically manly, and have had a growing interest in queer subjects since my teenage years. In my early twenties I started dabbling in makeup and crossdressing. Two years ago, I came to the conclusion that I was graysexual and demibiromantic. Earlier this year I started reflecting over my gender identity. I can see myself as not cis, but also have some hangups about refering to myself as such. This subject isn't a major burden on my mind, but it's in there.

&amp;#x200B;

**TIMELINE DISCLAIMER**

I've tried to put things into chronological order as best I could here, but as any queer person knows, self-discovery and questioning is a jumbled mess of thoughts over intervals of time with varying intensity, so many of the following parts have happened somewhat simultaneously.

&amp;#x200B;

**GROWING UP**

I grew up as an imaginative, studious and well-behaved kid. My passion has always been stories and fiction and I lived in my own imagination a lot. Through lower and middle school, my best friend was a boy, but my ‚Äúplay friends‚Äù during recess was a group of girls. We got along really well, but as the only boy in the group, I did feel a little ‚Äúout of the loop‚Äù sometimes. Girls just had a different way of being friends than boys, and at times I was jealous of it, particularly of how much the girls talked to each other about feelings and showed emotional vulnerability. That's not something I did with my male friends, and I felt a bit sad about it sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

I was never stereotypically manly. I've never been into sports of any kind, have been in a total of two fights (which both ended with me locked in the bathroom crying), always been emotional and close to tears, and although I liked talking and performing, I didn't take that much space in the social room. When I got bullied in high school, one of my bullies' main nickname for me was ‚Äúsissy‚Äù. I never really felt ‚Äúoppressed‚Äù by society's masculine ideal, but it was always clear to me that I didn't fit into it.

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts about my sexuality didn't come up until my teens. But I did have a crush on a girl in middle school, so hetero I was. And gender identity never crossed my mind. I was a boy. At the very least I knew I was not a girl, and as I was taught my whole life, those two were the only existing options...

&amp;#x200B;

**FEMINISM AND QUEER THEORY**

There's no way to say this without it sounding like a humblebrag, but; I think one of my most defining personality trait is my empathy. I just want people to be happy and no one to be hurt. So I think I was always destined to become a feminist, queer suppporter and the whole SJW shebang. Yes, I did some shitty things during my younger years as eveyone does when they're developing, but I've never wanted to cause harm, and if someone tells me they're hurting, I tend to believe them. As I grew older and met more people openly identifying as feminists, I realised I share that ideology, and started identifying as such myself at 19.

&amp;#x200B;

With the feminism came the queer theory. Coupled with how I've always wanted people to be happy, I never opposed queerness. But I did have a limited understanding on just how much queerness there was (thanks, school system!) so there was a lot to take in as I started getting introduced to all these concepts. But again, if people wanted to be happy and didn't hurt anyone, why wouldn't I support them? It generally seemed like the right thing to do.

&amp;#x200B;

At some point, I did get a bit of a special interest in gender theory and trans issues. All the concepts like gender identity, gender expression, biology, gender vs sex, nature vs nurture, etc, intrigued me and continute to do so until this day. I think it's a fascinating subject of discussion (I just wish it didn't come with all the oppression, but hey) and I try to learn and understand as much about it as I can. I took a few sociology and gender studies courses at university and follow a fair amount of queer video essayists online these days.

&amp;#x200B;

**MAKEUP AND CROSSDRESSING**

At age 18, I once painted my nails on a dare. I thought they looked pretty good, but had to remove them the next day for a social event. At age 20, I attended my first Pride parade. One of my accompanying woman friends painted my nails for me, and once again I liked it. I decided to try a few different colors over the next few weeks. It looked nice, and was also a good way to keep me from biting my nails. As they grew, I realised they could be styled. For 6 years now, I've had painted, long, filed nails 24/7. I really like it, and I get quite a lot of compliments from people about them, I suspect because I scan as male to most people, so they think it's novel.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last couple of years, I've experimented with makeup. Nowadays if I have a social event to attend, I usually throw on mascara and eyeshadow. If it's a party, I put on lipstick. I can see myself trying other products in the future. Together with makeup, I've also experimented with what many would call ‚Äúwomen's clothing‚Äù. I like to wear dresses, skirts, tanktops and high heels. Last year, I got my ears pierced and the earrings I wear tend to be fairly feminine.

&amp;#x200B;

What do I get out of this? Well, I would lie if I said it wasn't partly as some form of ‚Äúprotest‚Äù against society. I do enjoy breaking the norm, the thought of pissing off bigots gladdens me, and I'd like to think that maybe some man or boy that I've interacted with drew inspiration from me and started experimenting themself. But it's also for me. I do feel nice presenting like this. I like pretty things, and I think makeup and dresses make me look pretty. It's not required to get me through the day, and when I'm at home I usually wear pants and shirts for the lazy comfort, but in public I do enjoy presenting in a feminine or androgynous manner.

&amp;#x200B;

**ROMANTIC AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION**

I grew up on Disney movies and fairy tales, so I was fully aware of romance and relationships and enjoyed seeing them from a young age. At around age 9 I fell in love with one of my female best friends, and this crush lasted for about 4 years. It was intense, to this day some of the most intense feelings I've ever felt. Unfortunately, nothing romantic ever developed. I was too chicken to confess, she figured it out anyway, we stayed friends, and eventually drifted apart. I haven't spoken to her in 16 years.

&amp;#x200B;

These are, to this day, the only romantic feelings I've ever had. I've never gotten another crush or felt the same way about another human as I did about that girl. I do still remember the feeling of being in love, and at times I miss it. The theoretical idea of a relationship is something that I find really lovely, and I still find immense joy in fluffy romantical pieces of fiction (if it's queer, even better). But since I can't control it, and it's not like society owes me a relationship, I've never really fretted about it. I've found love and comfort in platonic relationships instead.

&amp;#x200B;

I did develop sexual feelings during puberty, though. Looking at women made the tingly things happen. I never made an effort to look at men, but they weren't a turn off or anything. At some point, I heard a statistic that said the average age people lost their virginity in my country was 17. I did panic a little bit about this, and being the fucking nerd I am, I thought around it in ways like: ‚ÄúWell, I know someone who lost theirs at 15, so I can still wait until 19 and not diverge from the norm!‚Äù. Thoughts like these bounced around a bit until I was around 22, when I one day suddently realised: Hey wait a minute. I don't fucking care about virginity and not even really that much about having sex at all. Sometimes my body needs a release, and the internet works for that. But I'm not gonna put any effort in trying to get laid. If I were to ever get the offer, I would try it out, in the same way I would try, say, bungee jumping. If it ever happens, it happens, and if it ever doesn't, then eh.

&amp;#x200B;

At some point I also realised gender really doesn't matter to my attraction, even though I have more of a leaning towards women. There really was no drama involved in this realisation.

&amp;#x200B;

All of this taken into consideration after a few more years of thinking, and I came to the conclusion that I'm graysexual (on the asexual spectrum, have a libido but limited intrerest) and demibiromantic (have the ability to feel romantic attraction towards any gender, but it apparently needs a very strong preexisting bond to kick off). Or, as is way easier to say: I am queer.

&amp;#x200B;

**PRONOUNS**

Now, here's something I really want to emphasize: I. Fucking. Love. Gender neutral pronouns. I think they're the coolest things in the world, they're so handy from a linguistic perspective, they're fascinating in how they function, and I truly believe their existance and usage contribute to a more equal and just world. I try to use them as much as possible. The gender neutral pronoun in my country has only become widespread the last few years and faces some conservative pushback, but I've always been an avid advocate for it. Whenever I read a book or watch a movie with gender neutral pronoun usage, my tummy goes warm and I can't help but smile. ‚ÄúIt has a non-binary character in it‚Äù is more or less enough of an endorsement for me to check out a piece of fiction. In my perfect fantasy utopian future society, gender neutral pronouns are the norm and no one raises an eyebrow at them.

&amp;#x200B;

I really cannot overstate it enough. I fucking love gender neutral pronouns.

&amp;#x200B;

With all that said, I really don't, uh... care which pronouns get used for me, gendered or not? I've grown up being called he/him my whole life, and it's never felt wrong in any way. But, it's also been the only option beside she/her presented by society, so who's to say what I would feel if I had known there was more options when I was growing up. I don't really feel any connection to she/her, but I can take or leave both he/him and they/them.

&amp;#x200B;

**BODY IMAGE**

I've never had anything I would describe as body dysphoria. There are some things I wish was different about my body; I wish my hair could be grown out to my hips, I wish I could grow a better beard, I sometimes wish my ribs weren't so visible when I'm bare chested, my stomach would ideally be a little smaller. But at the same time, there's plenty I like about it; My nails are strong enough to be kept long, my hair is naturally wavy and pretty, I've got a good height. In the end, there's nothing that causes me discomfort or anxiety, so I can't say I have body image issues.

&amp;#x200B;

I do sometimes envy cis women's bodies, though. Especially when I wear skirts, dresses and tanktops. I wish I had a figure that fit these clothes better. More feminine legs sticking out of a skirt. Slimmer waist and more distinguished hips underneath a dress. Breasts and cleavage to fill a tanktop. Oh God, breasts and cleavage to fill a tanktop! Guys, I fucking want cleavage! There are so many articles of clothing that would look better on me with cleavage! A few months ago, I was in a women's underwear shop with a friend of mine. Walking around, looking at the mannequins with their curves and bras and panties, I did feel something that could maybe be described as a ‚Äúlonging‚Äù. They were all so pretty, and I wish I could be pretty in the same way. If for nothing else, I at least want a feminine figure \~for the aesthetic\~.

&amp;#x200B;

**DOUBTS AND FEARS**

So now we come to the slightly heavier parts, where I touch on thoughts and anxieties I have about this gender identity thing. Now, these don't really cause me major pain or anything, but... they're there. They rattle around in my brain, and on some quiet nights, they bubble to the surface and get louder. And sometimes, they do make me tired, and I wish they would just go away. Some of these might be considered offensive or internalised bigotry. If anyone reading this feels hurt, I apologise. This is what I feel about myself, and no one else. Thoughts such as...

&amp;#x200B;

Am I nonbinary or just a feminine cis man? Yes, there are parts of the nonbinary experience I can identify with, but then again, I can identify with a lot of the male experience as well? Dressing feminine and defying society's expectations of being a man doesn't in itself make me not a man. But it is definitely outside of the cis male norm, and a lot of cis men will never understand my desire to do the things I do. At the same time, I've always found some pride in the fact that I can do these things and still feel secure in my ‚Äúmanhood‚Äù, whatever that actually means.

&amp;#x200B;

Do I just like the theoretical concept of being non-binary, or do I actually identify as such myself? Non-binary people inspire me. I recognise the struggle they face, but I do truly admire their way of breaking free from the rigid boxes society has set up for us. The binary and the people who defend it zealously make me so fucking tired, and I wish we as a society could get rid of it. But does that mean that I, personally, want to be outside of it? Or does it just mean I recognise a harmful and factually incorrect system that stands in the way of social justice? Fiction is a large part of my life and I do get really happy every time it uses gender neutral language or non-binary characters, and I know several trans people who have said they started exploring their identities through fiction, but is that what's happening to me? Do I myself want to go by they/them pronouns? The thought does intrigue me at least a little bit, but not because I feel any aversion to he/him or anything. Again, is it something I really want for myself, or do I just want society to have one more they/them user for the sake of it?

&amp;#x200B;

And perhaps my biggest gripe, the closest thing I guess I've got to a ‚Äúfear‚Äù, is... if I were to call myself non-binary... would I be betraying feminism and a lot of the ideological ideas that I think are worth fighting for? I think it's a fact that more women than men are feminists, so would me making that pool of men smaller by ‚Äúopting out‚Äù of it via my identity diminish the concept of gender equality in any way? Would people go ‚ÄúOh look, men don't actually benefit from feminism, that feminist wasn't even a man in the end‚Äù? I don't want that to happen! I do believe men benefit from feminism! I, identifying as a man, have benefitted from feminism! And something I've always advocated for loudly is the idea that outer appearance and expression doesn't impact one's internal identity, with myself as a frequent example! ‚ÄúLook at me, I can wear makeup and dresses and still be a man!‚Äù If I'm non-binary, did all of that mean nothing? In the cold mathmatical logical part of my brain, I would decrease the number of feminist men in the world, but increase the number of non-binary people, another group in need of representation. That's great! But then is that all I am, is that all this is to me, just numbers? No, of course it isn't. We're talking about people here, about individuals, about people with hopes and dreams and feelings who just want to live safely in the world. Am I harming them with this kind of thinking? Or am I in the end only harming myself? I don't know. I just don't know.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE END**

If you read all of or even just most of this... sincerely, thank you. You didn't have to. But I do appreciate you doing it. I've had these thoughts for a while now, and at the very least, it was nice to get them down on paper. If you have any insight, advice, questions or the like for me I would be more than happy to hear them. If you identify with anything you read and feel comfortable to tell me about it, please do. Maybe hearing how other people dealt with these kinds of things would help me. I'm hoping they would. I know I'm not special. I know everyone questions themself and struggles with this stuff. I'm just trying to figure myself out. I'm just trying to be happy.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you.

Or, as is way easier to say: I am queer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PRONOUNS**\n\nNow, here's something I really want to emphasize: I. Fucking. Love. Gender neutral pronouns. I think they're the coolest things in the world, they're so handy from a linguistic perspective, they're fascinating in how they function, and I truly believe their existance and usage contribute to a more equal and just world. I try to use them as much as possible. The gender neutral pronoun in my country has only become widespread the last few years and faces some conservative pushback, but I've always been an avid advocate for it. Whenever I read a book or watch a movie with gender neutral pronoun usage, my tummy goes warm and I can't help but smile. ‚ÄúIt has a non-binary character in it‚Äù is more or less enough of an endorsement for me to check out a piece of fiction. In my perfect fantasy utopian future society, gender neutral pronouns are the norm and no one raises an eyebrow at them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really cannot overstate it enough. I fucking love gender neutral pronouns.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith all that said, I really don't, uh... care which pronouns get used for me, gendered or not? I've grown up being called he/him my whole life, and it's never felt wrong in any way. But, it's also been the only option beside she/her presented by society, so who's to say what I would feel if I had known there was more options when I was growing up. I don't really feel any connection to she/her, but I can take or leave both he/him and they/them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**BODY IMAGE**\n\nI've never had anything I would describe as body dysphoria. There are some things I wish was different about my body; I wish my hair could be grown out to my hips, I wish I could grow a better beard, I sometimes wish my ribs weren't so visible when I'm bare chested, my stomach would ideally be a little smaller. But at the same time, there's plenty I like about it; My nails are strong enough to be kept long, my hair is naturally wavy and pretty, I've got a good height. In the end, there's nothing that causes me discomfort or anxiety, so I can't say I have body image issues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do sometimes envy cis women's bodies, though. Especially when I wear skirts, dresses and tanktops. I wish I had a figure that fit these clothes better. More feminine legs sticking out of a skirt. Slimmer waist and more distinguished hips underneath a dress. Breasts and cleavage to fill a tanktop. Oh God, breasts and cleavage to fill a tanktop! Guys, I fucking want cleavage! There are so many articles of clothing that would look better on me with cleavage! A few months ago, I was in a women's underwear shop with a friend of mine. Walking around, looking at the mannequins with their curves and bras and panties, I did feel something that could maybe be described as a ‚Äúlonging‚Äù. They were all so pretty, and I wish I could be pretty in the same way. If for nothing else, I at least want a feminine figure \\~for the aesthetic\\~.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**DOUBTS AND FEARS**\n\nSo now we come to the slightly heavier parts, where I touch on thoughts and anxieties I have about this gender identity thing. Now, these don't really cause me major pain or anything, but... they're there. They rattle around in my brain, and on some quiet nights, they bubble to the surface and get louder. And sometimes, they do make me tired, and I wish they would just go away. Some of these might be considered offensive or internalised bigotry. If anyone reading this feels hurt, I apologise. This is what I feel about myself, and no one else. Thoughts such as...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I nonbinary or just a feminine cis man? Yes, there are parts of the nonbinary experience I can identify with, but then again, I can identify with a lot of the male experience as well? Dressing feminine and defying society's expectations of being a man doesn't in itself make me not a man. But it is definitely outside of the cis male norm, and a lot of cis men will never understand my desire to do the things I do. At the same time, I've always found some pride in the fact that I can do these things and still feel secure in my ‚Äúmanhood‚Äù, whatever that actually means.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo I just like the theoretical concept of being non-binary, or do I actually identify as such myself? Non-binary people inspire me. I recognise the struggle they face, but I do truly admire their way of breaking free from the rigid boxes society has set up for us. The binary and the people who defend it zealously make me so fucking tired, and I wish we as a society could get rid of it. But does that mean that I, personally, want to be outside of it? Or does it just mean I recognise a harmful and factually incorrect system that stands in the way of social justice? Fiction is a large part of my life and I do get really happy every time it uses gender neutral language or non-binary characters, and I know several trans people who have said they started exploring their identities through fiction, but is that what's happening to me? Do I myself want to go by they/them pronouns? The thought does intrigue me at least a little bit, but not because I feel any aversion to he/him or anything. Again, is it something I really want for myself, or do I just want society to have one more they/them user for the sake of it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd perhaps my biggest gripe, the closest thing I guess I've got to a ‚Äúfear‚Äù, is... if I were to call myself non-binary... would I be betraying feminism and a lot of the ideological ideas that I think are worth fighting for? I think it's a fact that more women than men are feminists, so would me making that pool of men smaller by ‚Äúopting out‚Äù of it via my identity diminish the concept of gender equality in any way? Would people go ‚ÄúOh look, men don't actually benefit from feminism, that feminist wasn't even a man in the end‚Äù? I don't want that to happen! I do believe men benefit from feminism! I, identifying as a man, have benefitted from feminism! And something I've always advocated for loudly is the idea that outer appearance and expression doesn't impact one's internal identity, with myself as a frequent example! ‚ÄúLook at me, I can wear makeup and dresses and still be a man!‚Äù If I'm non-binary, did all of that mean nothing? In the cold mathmatical logical part of my brain, I would decrease the number of feminist men in the world, but increase the number of non-binary people, another group in need of representation. That's great! But then is that all I am, is that all this is to me, just numbers? No, of course it isn't. We're talking about people here, about individuals, about people with hopes and dreams and feelings who just want to live safely in the world. Am I harming them with this kind of thinking? Or am I in the end only harming myself? I don't know. I just don't know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**THE END**\n\nIf you read all of or even just most of this... sincerely, thank you. You didn't have to. But I do appreciate you doing it. I've had these thoughts for a while now, and at the very least, it was nice to get them down on paper. If you have any insight, advice, questions or the like for me I would be more than happy to hear them. If you identify with anything you read and feel comfortable to tell me about it, please do. Maybe hearing how other people dealt with these kinds of things would help me. I'm hoping they would. I know I'm not special. I know everyone questions themself and struggles with this stuff. I'm just trying to figure myself out. I'm just trying to be happy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI love you."", 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'Am I genderfluid?

I'm kind of scared of making life harder for people by having them use correct pronouns, and i have a trans friend who after a year still get's dead-named and incorrect-pronouns from her close friends, so i was wondering how it works with genderfluidity.

\-I want to be a classical singer, but singing types is defined by gender so i don't know what to do , would it be smart to just stay in the closet forever to become successful at a lifelong dream, whilst living a nightmare, or should i try and change the whole musical community?

I would often wish I was a boy because my interests and gender didn't match. I also had a harder time making female friends as I felt I could not understand them as well. (Later on in life, I had a friend explain how women socialize. I also have adhd and grew up in a male-dominated household so that may have an impact on this as well).  As I got older and went to highschool, I began realizing that I don't have to do lady things to be a woman (wear dresses, get dirty on the mud, etc..). In highschool, I had the chance to cross dress as a male and I felt soo happy. I confused one of my classmates as they said I looked like a male but walked like a female. (This day made me so happy). Other times in highschool, I did wear dresses and was fine being awknoledged as a female. As an adult, I socialize well with all genders. I typically dress more feminine but still feel confused as I don't feel 100% female all the time.

The reasons I thought I was transgender was due to a whole list of experiences growing up, specifically i.e. one time o had a breakdown cause I couldn't be go as a woman for Halloween one year due to my religious family and experimenting with my long term girlfriend my gender identity. There was also one time I asked my sister to specifically help dress me up so I could experience what is was like to be a girl(which granted i understand now its way more than that) but in my young my these were all steps!
The reasons I don't of I'm gender fluid are pretty simple, sometimes I don't care what I present as and sometimes I just present as male for the convenience. I also maybe just don't fully understand dysphoria.

I don't quite understand what you're supposed to feel behind being transgender or gender fluid enough to fully understand who I am supposed to be, so I'm hoping that from others knowledge and experiences things can become clear!

For background / context I accepted that I was bisexual around the age of 17 and I began to explore what it meant to me since then. I made 2020 a year for me to explore my femininity because I was scared girls would reject me for perceiving me as gay in the past, so I would limit anything that would be seen as feminine and I would try to pass my life off as a straight-acting male while still coming out to people as bisexual. This is the reason why I wanted to say fuck it and let go of that anxiety and induce myself into my feminine side this year and it went pretty well until June this year (I have always been comfortable with being seen as a male, a man, someone‚Äôs son, and my boy name). So what happened in June was I smoked some weed which is known for lowering your inhibition and euphoric thoughts of identifying as a girl started to pop in. My mind tried to fight them off, but I couldn‚Äôt and so I allowed myself to enjoy them and in which I honestly did. After that scenario I kind of brushed it off but over the next month and a half (July - August) I began to smoke more weed and would have these girl fantasies come in with more strength and it began to give me anxiety. I started to look up gender dysphoria quizzes because I was scared I was trans and it's been about 5 months later and I am still in the same boat. I have been questioning if I am trans and I don‚Äôt even know if I am an AMAB anymore.. 

To give more information, some of the things I enjoy in my thoughts is that I fantasize about being the girl during sex. I never did this before June and always masturbated to being the guy fucking the girl, but now I seem to get the most aroused by portraying myself as the girl during sex. Also, whenever I am on social media now (June till the present) and see relationships I get confused if I want to be the male or the female. I also am slowly beginning to realize I like to feel cute, or be called pretty.

Now, when it comes to the masculine presenting me that I have been expressing myself my whole life and even now I like to use the guy slang. I like looking like a pretty boy and feeling handsome or fine. The whole year of 2019 - 2020 (pre June) I was working out and obsessed with my body and sculpting it into the ultimate buff dude. In the past and even now I still continue to take and relate with the boy side/POV when it comes to which gender is worse (usually in topics of dating, etc on social media). I still enjoy dressing with male clothing and making masculine outfits that look good, and I don‚Äôt have any interest in wearing make up or wearing dresses or a bra at the moment. I also don‚Äôt see myself at the moment wanting breasts.

All in all, I am really scared I am trans and don‚Äôt want to be because I don‚Äôt think I could handle living my life like that. I honestly don‚Äôt truly know which gender I am at the moment and I am just really scared and don‚Äôt know what to do and feel helpless and don‚Äôt know which of my close friends I could talk to. I have told about 3 LGBT people at my school about what‚Äôs been going on and they have supported me and told me I‚Äôll figure it out but I still am just really scared. Also, side note I have been feeling depressed since about November of last year but during my depression until about the June phase I had never felt like I was sad over not being able to be a girl.

2020-11-26 21:44:56,k1o280,4,1,"Here are my ‚Äúsigns‚Äù of being trans,


For trans :

- Relate to most of the MTF egg memes/bingos

- Relate to most of the experiences of trans women on here

- Have bad depression, maybe related to gender dysphoria?

- On the ""am I trans part 2"" YouTube video I identified w/ 5 of the 7 ""signs"" of gender dysphoria

- I've crossdressed when I've had the chance since I was 17 (now 24).

- at age 14 I found that the phrase ""lesbian in a male body"" (or male lesbian) and the term ""autogynephilia"" and its ""symptoms"" really applied to me. It seemed like I had something that described my confusion for once. 

- age 14-16, would pray to wake up a girl every night (probably would have fit the diagnosis for gender dysphoria at the time), pray for brain transplant machine, want aliens to abduct me and change me to girl, wishing I was put in witness protection so I could get a sex change disguise and was curious about reincarnation

- always having had sexual fantasies as a girl

- took informal online gender tests and got ""female"" a majority of the time, generally excited when I did and disappointed when I didn't 

- fascination by gender bending themes in cartoons (code name kids next door, jimmy neutron, fairly odd parents, etc.), movies (scooby doo, freaky Friday, etc) and online captions

- sometimes choosing female avatars, including female names on some email accounts

- Seeing attractive girls, wanting to be w/ them and imagining being them at same time.

- Maybe felt some jealousy of women, confusing combination of emotions (clocked a transgirl at an airport and felt a mixed bag of emotions including what seemed like attraction, jealousy and others) 

- had lots of dreams in past few years as female, feeling very happy in them, hoping to go back asleep to continue them. Also tried lucid dreaming to try to be female in them.

- feel something missing in chest area at times. It can get annoying, especially when trying to sleep, and I would often use a pillow/blanket to ""fill the missing area"". Not sure if gender related though..  (could it be body dysphoria?)

- Doing tons of things that seem to point to wanting to be trans. I get disappointed if I think I‚Äôm cis and a warm fuzzy feeling when I think of being trans. I‚Äôve identified as Genderfluid for awhile but i don‚Äôt feel satisfied with it.


Against Trans:

- not really having dysphoria (though I hate my jaw, would rather not have body hair, and might have chest dysphoria). I don‚Äôt hate my body or being male (from what I can tell)

2020-11-30 11:00:00,k3tqz9,1,1,"After many years of questioning my gender and mostly struggling with it alone, last night I finally pushed myself to come out to my friends.

The pandemic has caused me to work from home, and I was hoping that by not being around my colleagues and not having to leave my house and go near other people, I would be able to spend more time exploring myself and experimenting, and hopefully start to understand and accept myself more. Well for the first 6-7 months that didn't really happen. I'd started buying more feminine clothing (I'm AMAB) and I would spend a lot of my time wearing skirts and dresses, but once my housemate started working from home, I stopped wearing them outside of my room, I would change into trousers every time I left my room, and change back once I'd closed my door.
Well about 5/6 weeks ago I finally decided to go to the kitchen in a skirt, and try not to worry about my housemate seeing me. It turned out he wasn't even home, so I let my guard down, but when I heard him unlocking the door I panicked and nearly ran to my room. I realised that he would see me even if I ran, and that that would look weirder than me just casually cooking in a skirt. So I stayed where I was, and apart from possibly a slight doubletake, he didn't react and just carried on as normal.
After that I basically lived in skirts and wore them around the house without concern, even sometimes answering the door and putting the bins out in a skirt, but still wearing trousers to go to the shop.

At the end of that week, I was going to be playing some games with a friend at a friend's house, and I decided to go in a skirt, which meant both going in front of them in a skirt, but also walking there in a skirt. I was a little anxious but I pushed myself to do it, and I'm really glad I did.
My male friends there didn't react and just carried on as normal, and my female friends got really excited, which made me quite happy. Unfortunately I don't handle emotion well, and I was already quite nervous, so I started to shut down a little. But after that everytime I would go see them I would go in a skirt. The last time I went round one of my friends started to talk to me about it more, asking where I got my dress from, how I felt about certain things, and she said about wanting to dress me, and that, if I was okay with it, she would buy me clothes for Christmas. This all made me really happy, which once again I struggled to convey to them, but I think it was this acceptance and support which helped to give me the confidence I needed to finally, actually come out to my friends.

It took 30 minutes to an hour to type up my coming out message, I pasted it into the discord chat, but I wasn't sure if I could send it, felt like I was starting to have second thoughts. So I went to the toilet and when I got back to me room I quickly pushed the enter key so that it would be sent and I couldn't really undo it. I ended up such a massive anxiety attack, but not long after posting it, my friends starting sending really nice messages of acceptance and praise, which helped make me feel like it was the right choice.

I'm still in a slight state of confusion, bot entirely sure whether it was the right choice, and because of the pandemic I don't get to see many of my friends in person, but I think after interacting more with my friends in a neutral setting, I think I might notice the subtle change of being assumed as male, to being treated as nonbinary, and I'm looking forward to it.

I've still not yet spoken with my housemate (he's in the discord group and has seen the message, I've just not bumped into him in the house yet) and I'm not sure whether he is going to bring it up or not and just carry on. I guess either is fine really.

Urghh, sorry for the excessively long post, this has just been a lot for me, and this has been a massive step that I have wanted to take for a long time, and I wanted to share it with the people on here. The posts on here and a couple other subreddits have helped me to become more confident in myself, and help me accept who I truly am.
