2020-12-02 01:13:41,k4yu9e,6,1," Hi, I'm in my mid-20s and recently had something of a revelation about my gender identity. I was born male, have always felt male, and still primarily consider myself to be a man (and a rugged, confident one at that), but have also long enjoyed the thought of myself as a woman, particularly in a sexual context. This probably started for me in high school or early on college. My recent revelation is that these feelings are indicative of something much deeper than a fetish or kink, that in fact I am at least partly female in how my brain is wired.

The last three weeks have been a whirlwind of emotions and confusion. I have spent who-knows-how-much time reading articles and reddit posts, and experimenting in private with clothing, breast forms, and face-swap apps. I have also shared my experience with a close female friend of mine and my dad, both of whom were very understanding and encouraging. Hell, my dad, much to my surprise, was borderline excited to hear that I was mixed-gender, telling me that it was yet another way in which I am unique as an individual and that he was proud of me for having the courage to be seriously asking myself difficult questions about who I am.

Even so, I find this to be a rather daunting position to be in (made even more daunting by the fact that I also just started dating a girl who I really like). Some days I am sure I mostly a man, albeit with a female side (call it a 70/30 split), other days I find myself wondering if I may in fact end up transitioning down the road. It's tough because as far as I can tell I don't dislike being a man and genuinely enjoy activities that are traditionally masculine (sports, camping, carpentry, hanging out in bars with my boys, climbing, off-roading, etc.), but at the same time am often excited by the idea of having boobs or wearing certain female clothing items. The idea of living as a woman and doing overtly female things seems foreign and scary. I'd like for now to go on living as a man, but clearly my female side needs to better understood and cared for in order to do so happily.

Right now it's hard to say for sure if I am simply a mixed-gender/gender-fluid man or if I am in fact a trans woman who in the future will need to transition. For now I am leaning towards the former, but am trying to remain open to the possibility of the latter, daunting as it may presently be.

I would love to hear other people's thoughts/suggestions on this...

2020-12-02 21:01:31,k5ibrc,3,1,"Lately I've been giving serious consideration to organizing the first ever national convention for  genderqueer, genderfluid, and gender nonconforming AMAB folks. I started brainstorming this idea back in 2000 when I was running the Boi\_Fancy mailing list, but sadly it never materialized.

Today, a lot more AMAB people are online exploring their gender compared to 20 years ago. Yet most are still too afraid to present authentically in public, or even around their own family and friends. So they are confined to their bedroom, hiding behind a screen-name to protect their identity. And that just brings tears to my eyes every time. I think that now is an ideal time to revive this concept.

The event would be slated for fall of 2021, assuming the pandemic has subsided by then. It would be a weekend-long gathering, consisting of gender-related workshops, discussion panels, vendor booths, and seminars offering information, guidance, and support in addition to a fashion show and a dance party. There could also be extracurricular activities in the evening like sleepovers, pillow fights, movies, as well as a designated play area for guests to explore their naughtier side in private.

With sufficient interest, we could conceivably rent out an entire hotel. This would afford guests a safe-space to express themselves openly and honestly for the duration of the convention. Of course, it would also give us priority use of the restaurant, pool, fitness center, and other hotel facilities.

Before moving forward with planning, I would like to gauge people's interest in such an event and also get feedback on what everyone would like to see!

**Kindshifter Identities**

Kindshifter identities shouldn’t be confused with the Ph-shifting and M-shifting experienced within the Therian community. Instead, what is specifically shifting is the gender of an individual. Like the shifting of positions on a violin, the shifting of gender experienced by Kindshifters is experienced in distinct hops and jumps around the gender spectrum.

**Ershifter**

Someone who experiences shifting gender, with a) a strong emphasis on masculine gender, b) without experiencing female gender, and/or c) without experiencing feminine gender.

**Kindshifter/Esshifter**

Someone who experiences shifting gender. Kindshifter is also an umbrella for Esshifter, Sieshifter, and Ershifter.

**Sieshifter**

Someone who experiences shifting gender, with a) a strong emphasis on feminine gender, b) without experiencing male gender, and/or c) without experiencing masculine gender.

I understand that your experience will vary from person to person, so it is hard to get a definitive answer, but I'll try to be specific with my question. This post is discussing gender norms/dysphoria, identity, just a warning if you're uncomfortable reading these topics.

I have a hard time understanding identifying as neither female nor male. I understand not conforming to gender norms, and being a masculine woman or a feminine man, or wherever you fall on that spectrum. But I don't understand how there can be multiple genders? I know that people say that gender exists on a spectrum, but why must not conforming to a traditionally masculine or feminine appearance/identity, mean that you are neither male nor female? Does that not enforce the idea that someone who presents in a typically feminine way is more of a woman than a masculine woman? Or vice versa with men? I've also heard conflicting things regarding dysphoria, I don't see how someone without dysphoria can identify as another gender?

2020-12-06 02:18:44,k7ky7e,1,1,"Currently: AMAB and identifying as somewhere between GNC gay femme and non-binary femme and using he/they/any pronouns (for now).

My gender has been a complicated subject consciously and continuously through my life since I was in 2nd or 3rd grade. I insisted on going to school for halloween in my sisters school uniform w/ a wig on. I remember vividly walking up the stairs internally wanting to be seen as someone who was not me and was disappointed (moderately) when friends recognized me. To be honest I give myself and my parents a big round of applause, me for being brave and expressive and my parents for letting me do my thing. Years passed and I'd dress up sometimes in secret, occasionally question what it meant and gravitate towards feminine things. These thoughts/feelings persisted into puberty and past puberty but I shoved them down a bit and only thought of them as non-conforming expression (something I felt embarrassed of but didn't want to be, that's the way I was). Being gay felt right, easier to acknowledge and less severe. Any further thoughts were shoved down

I finally came out my sophomore year of HS as gay. I finally felt free and free to express myself as femme as there seems to be more allowance / permission or even expectation for gay men to do such. I didn't begin to get confused again until arriving at college. I was surrounded by more queer people than ever before of all different identities. It wasn't until my sophomore year of college after doing psychedelics with my roommates that I was finally able to admit gender fluidity / an aspect of trans experience to my identity. I actually proclaimed I was a trans-woman. The day after the thought didn't feel quite as clear to me. I spent many months after talking to friends, therapist, family, obsessively thinking about such (I do have OCD) and researching forums, others experiences, trans / non-binary you tubers, etc. I came to zero concrete conclusion. This bugged me majorly and sent me into more of a depressive stage. Over time though I began to embrace the uncertainty and allowed myself to dress act, and be as unapologetically myself as I could be.

The following summer I began to experiment further. Growing out my hair, asking friends to use he/they/she pronouns via perception / my expression, wearing more makeup, dressing more femme, etc. I continued to research, journal, talk to all aforementioned and try and explore how I felt day by day. Eventually I was only being referred to by those who didn't know me in public by she/her pronouns, Miss, Ma'am, Ladies when in a group, I got cat called, was hit on, etc. Overtime I realized I was passing as a ""woman."" It was nice but not euphoric / there was no ""this is it!"" moment. To be honest overtime I became distressed over not being able to present more masc/ androgynous. I decided to cut my hair and for the experiment to be over. Cutting my hair gave me euphoria and presenting in boy mode again felt wonderful. I finally felt sexier then I'd ever felt. But part of me missed the more feminine me. The long hair, the way I was starting to act, etc. It's been almost two years now and I feel like just as many question have been raised the only difference is I'm more comfortable with myself.

The problem is I don't feel like cis, non-binary or binary trans fit me at all. All I know is I'm depressed and feel like I don't know myself. I oscillate frequently. Sometimes I tell myself that I've just rejected being a feminine man so much so I've convinced myself I'm non-binary (as I'm adamant to those around me that my gay-male title is important to me just as much as also being acknowledged as something more than that). I've prayed to be comfortable in a singular non-binary identity and I've longed to feel such a strong feminine allegiance that I can just transition to being a trans-woman. But the idea scares me. I like the way I look now, I like being gay I don't think I want to give it up forever. But part of me wonders if I'd be happier living as a woman. The problem is nobody can answer that for me and I can't for myself and I'm scared to dive into something that I may regret and only doing social transition didn't feel like enough.

2020-12-06 03:22:26,k7lxzu,0,1,"Hello, I currently identify as bisexual/gender fluid with he/they pronouns. I have asked several questions on this sub Reddit with great responses, thank you. But, I’m here to tell you what made me come to the realization that I am gender fluid. 

I have never fit stereotypes, one day I want my nails painted, the other I wanted to be the star football player. And the time in between, I just didn’t know. 
Since I was like 5, I never put much thought into it, that’s just who I was. 

Starting a few years ago(sixth grade), on some days I felt like I was a woman, and wanted to be perceived that way, other times I didn’t care and lastly I wanted to be a manly as possible. 
Still didn’t think much of it at the time, because I had never really heard about the LGBTQ+ community. 

( in between these times, I started to try on women’s clothing and loved it) 

Flash forward to this year, I’m out as bi, and I have a lot of free time on my hands, to think. All of a sudden on day, I look down and see my genitalia(I’mAMAB) and I hate it, I become so depressed and I wish for anything that I was a woman, the very next day, I do the same thing, and a completely different feeling happens, nothing. Just nothing. I was worried, because I had no clue what was happening to me. So I took to Reddit and google, thanks to everyone’s amazing support here, I realized I’m not 100% male, nor am I 100% female. I’m kinda everywhere. 

So, I started finding clothes and other things that helped my mental health when I’m having a fem day, or a somewhere in between day, and I couldn’t be happier

Masc day:
Hoodie
Male underwear 
Short socks
Shorts 

Masc-ish day: 
Hoodie 
Leggings 
Short socks 
Male underwear 

Fem-ish day: 
Crop top 
Shorts 
Female underwear 
Short socks 

Fem day: 
Crop top 
Female underwear 
Leggings 
Long socks 

I hope to get more of everything in the future so I can better express myself, but for now, this will do

(Depending on how diluted my genes through the generations I run the risk of not being embraced by a tribe on the upside if I’m within a a certain percent I get all the rights of a native but then I run the risk of creating a thing in my family)

I identify as a gay sis male, I’m attracted to men and I was born a man... BUT! because of my career (I’m an intuitive counselor, pls don’t come for me lol) and the way I feel (gender fluid) and my heritage (native) I decided to look into two spirit people and it’s apparently a match

In tribes two spirited beings were spiritual intermediaries (psychics and mediums) they were plural gender and had a personality that was both male and female, the idea is two spirits two personalities two energies in one body presenting as both. 

So I think I maybe two spirit? but I’d like to know if you relate or know anyone who is two spirit. 

I feel like I am working with two aspects of my personality all the time. Straight men have told me (some of them straight up rednecks who are normally homophobic) say I’m not like other gay men but they can’t put their finger on why.. ok, heard it a lot. My personality is playful and masc when I hang with men. I prefer to hang out with straight men vs gay men but I do have a handful of gay male friends that I adore but I have honestly never related to gay men the way I do with straight men. Idk why. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Women have told me they see me as a girl, I relate to them as a girl. 
When I meet someone who is trans I feel like I relate to them more than gay men sometimes.

2020-12-07 15:33:07,k8ipzm,4,1,"Hey guys, thank you for reading.

I really need your opinions and tips. And if, experiences.

I'd been in a relationship since 7 years ago and it's a good one, my guy, a straight cis man, even if he has his mistakes (just as me), has changed a lot, to good. I love that he has been a open minded person. He has learned and accepted Trans people ('cuz my best friend is), about all the lgbt community.

He even now sees it has bodies and minds separately. It' s cool.

I am still finding myself since I admit I didn't knew about the term Genderfluid since like 3 years ago but since all of that, I found that after all of this years not knowing who I was, since I knew I was not Trans (but still not conformed with my gender) I found about Genderfluid and tells about a lot of me.


He knows I'm Pansexual, that I was with a girl before him, and I can be with anyone after him (if). Or that I love dressing/looking like a man or like a neutral gender (I even have a lot of his clothes).


But again, he's straight. And I don't mind, that, for example he tells me he loves my big boobs even if somehow I don't.

Yesterday we were talking about her cousin that she got out as Bi, and I started talking to him a little bit of the differences about Pan and Bi, blahblahblah. Because he had the confusion of Bi = Only Two genders, yadayada. But when I told about the NB people and that I see myself a little bit of, he immediately snapped saying ""no, but you are a girl"".

I didn't want to go further 'cuz I am actually super scared of rejection.

I'm 28,so I feel like an idiot discovering myself until now with my gender. I even feel is not valid anymore. But I still feel is me, and that I always had those sizes of me but never gave them a place.

I am scared of trying to express more myself as and him starting to reject me.

Do you have a cis straight BF too or any experiences like this?

I am so scared.

2020-12-08 01:13:56,k8u6g9,2,1,"So, I've been really thinking about my identity lately, and I'm not sure anymore if I'm actually Fluid, or if I'm just Trans.

Let me try to explain, and I'm sorry if this gets rambly, I don't intend it to be but well, there's a lot.

I was born male, and as far back as I can remember there were a lot of things I wanted to do or have that were ""for girls"", toys, clothes, makeup, and even breasts.

And those desires for those things never really went away, despite me burying them with the help of society and bullying by peers and even family.

Then just recently, a few months back, I discovered genderfluidity and thought I found what I was, why I felt different.

I bought ""female"" clothes, even breast forms, and while I still haven't worked past my demons enough to wear what I got out in public, it made me happy.

But I've been thinking about it, and myself, more lately and I've had some doubts.

Thinking about all the things I've ever disliked about myself, they're all ""masculine"" things, all the ways I wish I could change are all ""feminine"" things.

I wish I could remove every inch of body hair from my body, I wish my eyebrows weren't so big, I wish I could wear makeup and dresses and have a higher voice and yes, definitely, I wish I had breasts.

Yet when I try to define what ""masculine"" me is, I come up blank, all I've got that I don't hate that is traditionally masculine about me is my height, I'm happy with how tall I am, and my penis, I don't think I'd ever want to get bottom surgery.

When I think of ""masculinity"", all I think of is sadness and things that aren't me, aren't who I want to be.

But when I think of ""femininity"" all I think of is happiness and things I wish I was, wish I could be.

I have my doubts, because I've never had to ""try"" to be anything masculine or male, so I've never had to ""think"" about what makes me masculine or feel masculine.

But part of me thinks my life would be so much easier, my confidence so much higher, if I was just a woman.

I know, I need to actually go out in public and see what it's like to be more ""fem"" and identified as ""fem"" before I say anything for certain, and I'm the only one who CAN say for certain who I am, but what do you guys think?

2020-12-08 09:58:07,k91kr5,4,1," Hello. I was asked to write a piece on why my school should have a unisex/gender neutral bathroom and I thought that I should share it with you for your opinions on it.

So, I wrote a piece for my school's principal on why we should have a unisex/gender neutral bathroom. I thought I might share it with you wonderful people to see what you think. Hopefully it works and we get our bathroom.

60% of transgender or gender non-conforming individuals avoid public bathrooms. There are many reasons for this, ranging from gender dysphoria (the feeling of unease about your gender/body) to general uncomfortability or potential harassment (which I hope our school is better than). I am one of these people, I have friends that do this and I know that there are others in our school that do this. Schools are beginning to implement unisex bathrooms for transgender or gender non-conforming individuals, and we should be one of them. We need to be one of them.

First of all, it makes these students more comfortable and feel better about themselves. Being forced to choose between two things you don’t fit with is a very annoying and confusing thing to do. Feeling wrong and out of place when all you want to do is use the bathroom can make people avoid school bathrooms altogether or just have a bad feeling the entire time. Having neutral bathrooms would make the satisfaction of non-binary students greater, as we would finally have a place to simply use the bathroom without having all these thoughts.

Also, gender neutral bathrooms are a step towards the future. By acknowledging and accepting the non-conforming students, it will make the general awareness of us better, and maybe we wouldn’t have to deal with as many questions and stares when trying to use the bathroom. Because that happens. And it sucks. Having a neutral bathroom is something that many schools are doing in order to accommodate towards all students, something that they are being praised for by most as a way to accept and cater for all students regardless of gender.

A counter-argument that has been heard many times is the risk of ‘peeping toms’ and people using the bathroom for ‘other’ reasons. But these should be low risk. First of all, from what I have heard, it would be a one or a few stalls bathroom, which would be like the boys’ and girls’ ones, with locks. So no one can use this argument against a neutral bathroom, as there would be walls and doors. For the people fearing harassment or ‘other’ issues, the solution is simple. They don’t have to use the gender neutral bathroom. We would still have the girls’ and boys’ bathrooms, so no one should be using the neutral one if they don’t want to. People try to discourage this idea with many arguments about health and safety, but if students don’t agree with this, they can still use the gendered bathrooms. The unisex ones would be for everyone, but if they feel unsafe in them, the problem is easily rectified.

So, this is the proposal for a gender neutral bathroom at \[School name\]. It would benefit many students and make an overall better school for everyone, where everyone can safely and happily go to the bathroom without fuss. It is a simple and hopeful request that we hope can be fulfilled. Please consider the students here and help us get our gender-neutral bathroom that we need. Thank you for reading this.

2020-12-08 21:21:07,k9dbqx,6,1,"So I'm starting to think I might be genderfluid. The reason I say this is because a few weeks ago I stated identifying as agender, but now if given a choice between agender, boy, and, girl, boy would be my second choice, with agender as my first (I'm AFAB by the way), so right now I think demiboy would fit.

When I was questioning my gender for the first time, ther wher days when I would question more than others.

Some times I feel perfectly fine putting female on forms that your gender, and other times I'm defenetly not.

Part of me is afraid that I'm just a boy in denial, because even though there where times when I was a girl (I know this because a teacher called me a very smart young woman and that made me happy), my demiboy brane is like ""why would you want to be a girl, that would suck"" and also having a hard time understanding how it was ever a girl, so I can't figure out if the times I was a girl, because I was raised as one and was less dysphoric that day, or because I was actually a girl.

2020-12-13 01:06:18,kc13uo,0,1,"Trigger warning: Self harm, suicidal thoughts

I'm 19, afab, and I've known for a long time that I wasn't cis. Looking back, I already knew in my childhood, and I had a hard time making friends because I was always different. I had my first bad episode at about twelve years old, when puberty hit. This was the first time I really felt like a boy, and I had dysphoria really bad, but then suddenly it went away, and I actually enjoyed being a ""girl"". For about two years, I changed between being a girl and non-binary, and I had few to no dysphoria.

When I was fourteen, it all came back, it was so bad that I already had a plan on how I would commit suicide. I had a date for it. I don't really know what saved me, but in the last moment I changed my mind and decided to live. I have since gotten help, so don't worry. Shortly after, I changed back to feeling like a girl, and I felt great. For about a year.

At fifteen, again, all came back. I started to understand what was going on, and at this point, I had heard about trans people, so I had a word for it. However, I hadn't heard about non-binary or genderfluid people. So I thought I was ftm, but it didn't feel right as I did not always feel like that. I decided to not tell anyone so I wouldn't have to label myself. I told myself that it was just a phase. And I was a lot stronger than the year before. My depression came back, but not my suicidal thoughts. I wanted to live. But to deal with the pain, I started to cut myself.

I was nearly seventeen when I had my next bad time, and I started to cut again. It had been almost two years in which I had only changed between being a girl (so no dysphoria) and non-binary (dysphoria, but not that bad). I was so helpless and angry. I had ignored this for two years and I thought that it was alright, that it wouldn't come back. But it did. I started to do more research, I found out about being non-binary and the different identities, but I didn't want that. I said myself all the things you don't want to hear from others. ""It's just a phase"" ""I'm just confused"".

My mom found out about my self harm, and I stopped my research. I saw that she was unhappy, and I didn't want to cause any problems. I just played a role, and eventually my identity shifted again and I was a girl again, all happy.

I have had three other ""man"" episodes since. One in spring 2019, one in winter 2019/2020 and the last one has just started. It's always the same shit, with identity struggles, dysphoria, self harm. I never told anyone, just waited to become ""normal"" again. But I did my research and tried to be open to it, to find out what I am actually. I accepted that this is part of myself and that it will always come back, no matter how hard I try. And even if I feel ""just"" non-binary, I have dysphoria,  so I will eventually have to do something about it. I don't plan to physically transition, since I feel okay most of the time, but I want to come out to my parents.

Now I just shifted to feeling like a man, and it's really difficult now. For Corona reasons I'm home with my parents, and they've already noticed that there's something wrong. And this will last for around four to six weeks, maybe even two months, according to my previous experiences. So I plan on coming out soon, so i can be myself and maybe get myself a therapist.

I know that they will be supportive. I'm sure that my mother has a clue, she always watches documentaries on trans kids and then makes comments on how she would support this child, and on how parents should be supportive, towards me. My father doesn't know anything, but I know he accepts the LGBTQ+ Community. He will have a hard time, but I'm sure it will be okay.

I know my parents will be supportive, but I'm so afraid. I'm not really looking for advice here, I just wanted to talk to someone and tell my story.

2020-12-13 01:16:57,kc19w4,4,1,"Hello!!

Im posting here becsuse i feel like i am genderfluid but im not entirely sure

I was born a female, but growing up I remember feeling frustrated that i wasn't allowed to do ""masculine""  things
I just used to wish i was a boy so i can just feel that part, so i can finally express it

However, now that i am older and questions about gender and more spoken about, i am feeling confused again ( i tried to ignore it for awhile)

One of the reasons why i am confused is because now i enjoy being a girl, i dont mind looking like a girl, however, i feel weird having people call me she 

I dont feel like a she

But i don't feel any better being a he, or a they

I feel like physically i am okay with having female autonomy, but when it comes to how i dress, i love being able to mix, 
Having a look that is more masc however still fem, or sometimes just masc not fem, vice versa 

I feel my personality is very masc, but i like being a girl?

2020-12-18 14:03:42,kflo4a,0,3,"Disclaimer: I am not a native English speaker. Sorry if there are mistakes in the post.

I am AMAB, 25, but as far as I remember, my gender has always been fluctuating between male, female, and Androgynous, although I wasn't fully conscious of it at the start. My birth name is fully male, but the shortened version that almost everyone uses is gender-neutral, so I hadn't had too many problems on that side.

Still, I have been keeping it secret for a long time because I feared that someone would think that I had multiple personalities or something like that when it isn't the case. After all, I was completely oblivious about gender identity topics. It had only been in recent years that I learned about the existence of genderfluid and noticed that it was my case.

Later on, I was already so used to hide my changes in gender identity that I couldn't come with a chance to mention it. I had enough of hearing, don't do this because it is girly, that I improved my acting skills to a level that sometimes I even forgot that I was acting. Of course, that couldn't last long, and I remembered not too long after that.

Yesterday, I finally decided to tell my mother about it. By phone because with Covid, there is no way I can travel to where she lives, and it isn't near anyway. I would have liked to tell it personally, but I was unable to endure anymore, and I had more faith in her than in my father, although I live with him.

Her reaction wasn't bad, but I wouldn't call it good either. She really couldn't understand what I was explaining, although she tried.

She asked me if that meant that I wanted to be a girl, and my reply was sometimes. 

She also mentioned that I never showed any sign of that in the past, but I guess her memory of telling me don't do this faded with the time, although she even told me things like that quite recently...

I told her as easy to explain as I could, simplifying a lot, that when I am in ""female mode"", I feel like a girl, which includes wanting to dress and be recognized as one. That when I feel Androginous, I consider myself to be quite a boyish or tomboy girl. (Yes, I tend more towards the feminine side, it is just the image on my mind, so maybe it isn't really androgynous but demigirl or something else, but even I can't understand it properly. Non-binary, that is sure.)

The other was easier since it was male, which was what she always considered that I was full-time, although I mentioned that even as a male, I hated how I looked. As a male, I would like to look somewhat androgynous since I don't like muscles (Not like I have since I avoided any exercise that could create them, so they aren't a problem) nor facial/body hair.

In fact, the facial/body provokes dysphoria in me no matter what mode I am in because I dislike it as a male, female, and androgynous, so I have already booked to start the laser.

I also mentioned that I liked girls independently of the gender identity I have at the moment because it was too predictable that she would make assumptions that ""wanting to be a girl = liking boys"", and hearing the question was worse than just tell it myself.

Until this point, what I explained went relatively well, but my mother didn't really know how to react when I told her I wanted a bra.

In fact, the urge for a bra was what pushed me to confess since I needed to comment on the topic with someone. 

I have had gynecomastia for several years, and although they were somewhat sensible, and the size made them look like it was fat, they weren't fully developed nor were as sensible as women's breasts. It was the doctor at my old company who told me that it wasn't fat but gynecomastia. I didn't even know that it was possible to develop breast tissue being AMAB without hormones at that time, but since it wasn't a harmful condition, and in female mode, I really liked to have breasts even if they were small, I didn't mind about them. 

However, lately, the breasts have turned sore again. I remember the sensation from the first time they grew, so maybe they are growing again. This time turned to be even worse because they are hurting at the minimum movement, even without moving at sometimes due to the lack of support, so the female me thought that it was a great chance to get a bra for the first time, so I wanted to speak of that with my mother.

I have been restraining my female side too much time, so I really wanted to sue the chance to mentalize my mother and slowly dress more like a girl when I feel that I am one. Moreover, my androgynous side also longs for female clothing, although that is a more boyish style, which could be easier to wear without catching too much attention. 

My mother didn't really understand that. She told me if I just wanted to dress as a girl inside the house, and then I could just get some nightwear. I replied that inside and outside, at least after the laser because as a girl, I feel worse seeing myself as a guy cross-dressing than being just a guy when I feel like a girl(Not like I like mirrors when I am like that, though, since seeing myself as a guy when I feel like a girl still feels bad).

In the end, she told me that she needed to assimilate so much information, which had been obviously hard to swallow for her.

I hadn't spoken with her again since yesterday, but I am somewhat scared as although she didn't show rejection, she clearly isn't understanding it. I live with my father because although I work (remotely without never ever needing to show my face, so I can dress at my will), it isn't enough to rent a place in my city alone and to share the place with a strange I prefer to stay with my father. However, I doubt my father can understand it at all. He already feels that it is stupid having such an urge to depilate all the body. He thinks that I should only do the face and the chest, but I feel sick with all the body hair, not just that, although the face and chest hair are the ones I hate the most.

Once I get rid of my unwanted body hair, I really want to start dressing as I feel, which depends on the day, but with my current situation, I don't even feel confident in buying bras and keeping them outside his sight.

The worst part is that I have no idea of how to tell him. My mother is the comprehensive one of the two, and she already seemed to have problems understanding it, so I don't have any confidence.

I don't think he would kick me out since he isn't openly transphobic, but I know his personality, and even if I do my utmost to express this to him, he would probably say something like, ""That is stupid, just a phase. You will forget tomorrow"" or something like that. That kind of rejection would hurt me too much, and the worst is that I know that he wouldn't say it with bad intentions.

I mean, every single time I tried to change something in my life, he reacted exactly in that way. For example, if I obeyed him the last time he said words of that style, I would be jobless right now.

For now, I have been practicing making a girl's voice when he isn't home since I don't need to buy anything (When I am a girl, I don't like having a male's voice. Mine isn't too deep, but it didn't reach an androgynous level, nor female level). Still, I also need to practice with makeup after the laser, and I doubt too much I can do it without him noticing at all.

I am not sure how I would look without any facial hair and long hair (from detachable extensions, for now, I guess, but I had yet to buy). 

I am planning on letting it grow since I also want it long as a male, but until now, I have always been half forced to cut it each time it grew by constant mentions of ""you should cut it"" that in the end, made me cut it as I couldn't stand that anymore. Still, at least I always maintained it just short. I never allowed having it cut extremely short as much as everyone told me to do.

The good part is that I have always had bangs that are great for AMAB to look like a girl without needing to do something special on that part.

The face is the part that scared me the most, as I need to look well or as a girl, I wouldn't like it at all. 

I don't fear so much the body because, thanks to the gynecomasty, my sizes aren't too different from those of a tall girl with somewhat broad shoulders and not too big chest. In fact, looking on the internet for female clothing options for different types of body, I found a girl that has almost the same measurements as me, just her waist a couple of centimeters slender and her hip a couple of centimeters wider. If I finished losing the couple of excess kilos that remain from quarantine, it would probably be better, though.

I feel that if I could dress properly as a girl, it would be easier to say to my father, too, since it would be more visual, but to practice for that, I would need to practice makeup in secret, and this seems difficult.

Any recommendation on how to face this? I really need to start expressing my female self (the androgynous too, but I feel the highest urge to do it when I am in female mode).

Sorry for the long post.

Still, I also need to practice with makeup after the laser, and I doubt too much I can do it without him noticing at all.\n\nI am not sure how I would look without any facial hair and long hair (from detachable extensions, for now, I guess, but I had yet to buy). \n\nI am planning on letting it grow since I also want it long as a male, but until now, I have always been half forced to cut it each time it grew by constant mentions of ""you should cut it"" that in the end, made me cut it as I couldn\'t stand that anymore. Still, at least I always maintained it just short. I never allowed having it cut extremely short as much as everyone told me to do.\n\nThe good part is that I have always had bangs that are great for AMAB to look like a girl without needing to do something special on that part.\n\nThe face is the part that scared me the most, as I need to look well or as a girl, I wouldn\'t like it at all. \n\nI don\'t fear so much the body because, thanks to the gynecomasty, my sizes aren\'t too different from those of a tall girl with somewhat broad shoulders and not too big chest. In fact, looking on the internet for female clothing options for different types of body, I found a girl that has almost the same measurements as me, just her waist a couple of centimeters slender and her hip a couple of centimeters wider. If I finished losing the couple of excess kilos that remain from quarantine, it would probably be better, though.\n\nI feel that if I could dress properly as a girl, it would be easier to say to my father, too, since it would be more visual, but to practice for that, I would need to practice makeup in secret, and this seems difficult.\n\nAny recommendation on how to face this? I really need to start expressing my female self (the androgynous too, but I feel the highest urge to do it when I am in female mode).\n\nSorry for the long post. I really needed to tell this to someone, and I don\'t have any friends I could trust enough for this matter.', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'I have always been genderfluid, but I am having problems to come out in front of my family', 'created': 1608325422.0}"

&amp;#x200B;

So first of all, I do support the idea of transgender people. However, I feel identifying yourself as a specific gender without actually being diagnosed with something like Gender Dysphoria is not healthy, and could even be compared to self-diagnosing. This is why I do not understand the idea of Gender-Fluidity.

I do not in good conscience think that it is possible for someone's gender identity to legitimately change. Transgender people are trans because of a provable difference in their gender identity from their biological sex. You cannot simply say ""I feel like a boy one day, and a girl the next.""

I know people support the idea of simply identifying as whatever you want just because you FEEL like it, but in my opinion without getting some sort of diagnosis that is harmful as a whole and undermines the topic of gender identity by claiming you can be whatever you want.

They can go from he/him to she/her to they/them to she/they to he/they all within a single day, sometimes multiple times within a day. Because of this, gender fluidity and they/them are a big part of their identity.

Because they are very gender fluid and can flow between gender identities so often and so frequently, they don’t like the term “enby” since it doesn’t fully describe them. I was wondering if there was any similar terms for gender fluidity; something cute but also validating at the same time.

As their cisgender boyfriend, I don’t know much about gender fluidity, but I empathize with the struggles and pain they go through, and I want to be as supportive and validating as I possibly can be.

Mostly I experience discomfort and I tolerate them b/c welp they’re a part of my body... however, in our system we have a binary male identifying individual and he experiences a lot of dysphoria especially towards the chest.

However, getting my dad on board w the decision has been a bit troublesome and one of his main arguments is that we are “too young to make the decision” (body age is 22) because later on in life we might want to have kids and he says “boobs are not dress up items, they’re child bearing gifts” 

...so I’m here to ask if any other non-binary folks or trans ppl in general who’ve had top surgery have regretted their decision later on in life?

CW: Dysphoria, chest dysphoria, 18+ questions 

Are there any AFAB gender fluid people here that have gotten top surgery? If so why? What was your experience? Do you miss being able to tap into that feminine characteristic? 

Hi! I’m AFAB non-binary but am currently in the identity blender and I’m wondering if I’m Gender Fluid or just like eyeliner and feeling hot. 

My chest dysphoria fluctuates mainly from neutral to very uncomfortable, but I have these stand out moments when I’m alone and put on a push up bra and some sexy clothes, and all of a sudden I look and feel really attractive? And also feminine?
It’s weird. When I draw myself normally I alway make myself look really androgynous, and give myself a flat chest, but in the couple times I’ve tried drawing myself ‘sexy’ I’ve always added my curves and chest? Like I just haven’t yet been able to picture myself differently in these situations. 

I haven’t had a partner or been intimate with any one yet, but when picturing it I’ve really gone back and forth. Like sometimes my skin crawls imagining myself being intimate with breast, and sometimes I think it would be really fun and nice. 

Is this just normal dysphoria or is it specifically gender fluid dysphoria? 

I’ve been keeping track of when and how I have dysphoria and it’s multiple times a week and mainly centered on my chest. 
I would love to have Top Surgery, and sometimes I want to start T, but those moments of me feeling feminine, and feeling good about my chest are really holding me back. 

Sometimes I hate my chest and it just feels wrong, and sometimes they’re warm and soft and I feel like I’d miss them. 
Sometimes I want to fully transition into a man, sometimes I look at myself in the mirror and am okay looking like sexy lesbian and am even okay with that label. 

My desire to be NB is 60%, full on masc 30%, and to be sexy with rocking tits and cute outfits is 10%. 

Maybe I’m just NB and like dressing up fem and it would be easier to do so with a chest?

I have a gender therapist, but my next appointment isn’t for another week and I’ve  really been stewing.

Then gender started fucking me up. I eventually got the the label of genderfluid, something that both took far too much data and far too little time.

But, as the genderfluid label might not even be accurate to me I\'m not sure the same ideas apply.\n\nI guess what I\'m asking is if it would be alright, or at least acceptable until something significant makes itself incredibly known, for me to just ignore whatever may be inaccurate about the genderfluid label for me. Can I still call myself genderfluid even if it isn\'t the most descriptive label I could find, or possibly not entirely accurate?', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'Can I just call myself genderfluid and be done?', 'created': 1608646074.0}"

I’m making this post because, spoiler alert: I’m confused about gender identity.

Here’s a little bit of a timeline on me and my gender identity: 

For all of my life up until a few months ago, I’ve felt comfortable with using she/her pronouns and being a female. This year, before I started questioning my gender identity, I always really liked the idea of being androgynous and confusing people about my gender. Now, I’m questioning whether I’m genderfluid or nonbinary. 

Here are a few things I know for sure:

- I am comfortable with she/her pronouns sometimes, but other times I wouldn’t mind they/them pronouns too, or a mix of both.
- I do not resonate with identifying as male or using he/him pronouns.
- I often like to dress androgynous, but sometimes I enjoy dressing up and putting on makeup and presenting more “feminine”.

A bit over a year ago, I came out as genderfluid, first to my best friend, then to my therapist, then to everyone. Then, around the start of COVID, I got bored and joined Reddit, joining this sub soon after.
In August, I came out again, as gay. I had struggled most of my life with my sexuality, changing what I said every six months, and coming out and knowing that I only like girls made me realize what happened. I went to elementary school at a Christian school and I was very God centered. I knew I was attracted to girls, but I did anything I could to escape from it. I said I was bisexual and that I would just never date a woman and therefore it wouldn't be a sin. It was awful and damaging.
Then I realized I was doing the same with my gender. If I were genderfluid, I could just pretend to be a cisgirl, right? I had thought often about the possibility of being trans but dismissed it with excuses of, ""Well, every once in a while you like to wear a dress!"" and ""You were blessed with big breasts! You can't just throw that away!"" and also that I had confused my attraction to women and thinking they're beautiful with wanting to be a beautiful woman.

2020-12-26 13:01:42,kki9j3,8,1,"I'll start with the tl:dr for my questions.

What does it feel like to be male at one moment, female another, and something else another?  How do you know it's a gender thing and not just changing preferences on clothing and behavior?  Is it pretty obvious when you're more aware of it, or is it usually more subtle?  What made you realize you were gender fluid?

&amp;#x200B;

Some background on where I'm coming from.  I'm an AMAB who has recently begun questioning my gender identity.  For a long time I have been experimenting with light crossdressing, just in very private and never 'all out'.  It was really just for a rush with it being 'taboo' and to be honest, after puberty was mostly a sexual thing than anything.  I don't think I ever really felt like I was truly female during it.

&amp;#x200B;

Lately though I've been seeing things differently.  I've had impulses to look more feminine, a lot of just imagining going about my normal day in a skirt/dress and/or wearing makeup, but some more subtle things being acted on like shaving my normal goatee (and keeping it shaved) and being more fixated on skin care.  Looking back there have been times where I just didn't like the way I looked no matter what I wore, but other times I liked the way I looked in the same male clothes.  I did also go out a couple times and spent a few days inside wearing women's underwear.  I didn't really feel like a woman or anything, but I was also comfortable in them, so I don't know what to think lol

&amp;#x200B;

I know the determination is ultimately up to me, I'm not really expecting any validation of what I feel.  But before I make a big jump in experimenting with my feminine side, I'd like to hear about the experiences of others to see if anything resonates with me.

They understood, even if partly, the amount of confusion, self-doubt, and oft-times self-loathing, that I have risen out of, and acknowledged the courage it took for me to let them in. I can\'t have been happier with the way this played out. r/genderfluid has been close to my heart all this while and seeing folx be themselves, listening to their stories, just being here, even, has helped me in coming to terms with my reality.

**upbringing/life**  
throughout my childhood and into my early 20s my mother always told me that women would be afraid of me  due to my size. I am a large guy (fuck me if I am actually trans). over and over again it was imbedded into my brain. If any one ever read kofka on the shore it very much feels like kofka's oedipal curse, just none sexual. Eventually in HS I had a crush on this girl, the other guys apparently convinced her I was going to rape her to make it easier for their friend to make moves on her. I was devastated and had a fairly terrible time at the school for a couple years after. It solidified the statements my mother raised me with and have given me lots of problems (I intend on going to therapy once i am out of the house). because of this I feel separated from my masculinity on a level.   


I felt from a young age pressured to preform, even through learning disabilities, and the girls around me always tended to be more lax about their lives. I envied that greatly. My mother always pushed that she just wants me to be able too make my way in life but I feel like the option to live a moderate existence was never on the table. I always had an over active imagination, lots of daydreaming and too much creativity for my own good. But due to problems with my hands I could never bring them to life, almost every girl I knew had clean hand writing and far better art skills them me. I envied that.   


My parents needlessly gender little details in my life. If i do something atypical they try to tease me for it, if i do something typically masculine i get teased for it. For instance hating pink gets me shit. wanting to learn to sew for cosplay as a kid was shushed away. They were and still are verbally opposed to me having long hair. No one in my family will shut up about it for long. But I genuinely feel better with long thor like hair.   


**kink**  
When I was young I read ""Is he a girl"" I couldn't stop trying to kiss my elbow for months, my thought proses at the time  was because I wanted to know what girls looked like ""down there"" these desires faded when i learned how too look up porn on the internet but later returned when I wanted too know how girls ""felt down there"", in the process of trying to find that information I found descriptions of the afab sexual experience incredibly arousing. eventually discovering gender bender porn and hentai. The desire to read this hentai came and went, usually with real world stressors like exams, feeling like my masculinity was causing me issues, or feeling over all stuck. Lately it has been almost all consuming  due to covid isolation and the rough job market post graduation. It always felt like a kink. I never had the desire to cross dress, or transition. I just wanted to be a girl temporarily from time to time. to escape the confines and flaws of my form. I ID heavily with the main character of Kampfer.  


I also have other TF fetishes that can get a little GAMPy in some contexts.   


  
**other**

My personal style is masculine, and I don't like very many feminine things and i have no interest in typically feminine things like dresses. I feel fairly indifferent to she/they/he pronouns. I have been called ma'am (with my full beard), it doesn't anger me personally but I always feel a different kind of anger, one for trans folk who probably get misgendered by the same types of people who seam to be making jabs at me.  


Needless gendering of my opinions is really painful. For instance when I have a disagreement with someone on a gender/sexuality neutral topic and they try to imply IDing as cishet is why I have some given opinion. stuff like that is really off putting and usually triggers a *flair up. I* am particularly sensitive to this type of treatment.   


i know I've felt masculine gender euphoria, for a time I was working out a lot, i couldn't stop flexing my growing biceps, the increasing tone on my shoulders made me estatic. I would just look in the mirror and feel so happy. But usually i have a cold indifference to my self, only feeling good in a few cosplays. But all and all I feel like a man.  


**the reason i am questioning**   
3 months ago a close friend of mine said ""you don't have to hate your dick to be trans"". this was one of those things i didn't realize i believed. I got anxious and looked for validation. instead i found people with eerily similar stories to mine, and trans narratives that felt close to mine. this only increased by anxiety. I am afraid of the unknown. some days i feel my self, other days everything feels off. but prior this wasn't the case at all.  


I don't know what's fetish and what's gender for me. I feel like my desires are inherently at war. Idk if i am trans, genderfluid with a broken bond with my masculinity, or some form of other nonbinary. I don't want too transition, but I am afraid of genuinely wanting it down the road. idk if I am just repressing, or just a damaged person with the worst coping mechanism possible. idk, none of the possibilities feel valid for me.",genderfluid,questioning and in need of some help easing anxiety,1609210422.0,"{'created_utc': 1609185222, 'id': 'klxlq6', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Hi, I\'ve been going through a lot lately and i need some help understanding my self.

2020-12-28 20:20:34,kly4mz,5,1,"Hi everyone.

I'm new here and new to reddit in general really. I'm currently questioning my gender and on a journey of self-discovery and ALOT of unpacking of emotions and feelings. Also I am new to alot of things and trying to educate myself, so I am truly sorry if I say anything to cause offense or use the wrong language/terms or if I should be posting this in a different subreddit. 

To cut to the chase I tried on some of my gf's clothes in secret because I could no longer control my desire to dress feminine. And it's hard to describe how I felt exactly but I did feel amazing. For the first time I really felt cute and pretty and sexy and comfortable! I've never really felt like this dressing masculinely. I've gotten by but never really felt happy with my appearance. I did, however, feel guilty for trying my gf's clothes in secret so today I bought some girl's clothes online in a size closer to mine to try it again without feeling like I'm stealing or anything. 

I can't properly express how excited/nervous/scared I feel about it. Buying the clothes really felt like I was legitamising all my questioning feelings which I know isn't a ""bad"" thing. It just makes it real. Which is exciting but kind of terrifying. Before I was questioning, I was a straight cis male who thought I had weird kinks and fetishes and had really bad self worth and self image issues. But back then I was ignorant and neglectful of my own feelings and indentity. I never really thought about them, just felt shame and awful about myself. Now I'm questioning which is terrifying in it's own way but I do feel like this is a good thing overall and I am glad I am making the effort to find who I really am, instead of repressing it and poisoning myself with all the shame and guilt and self-loathing.

Apologies for the rant. Turns out I needed to vent a bit lol. This is the first time I've ever spoken (written) about this so my mind is a lil all over the place. I would love to talk to other people about this kind of stuff because I currently have no one and all the subreddits I've been creeping in seem to have such amazing and supporting communities. Anyway I'll stop turning this into an essay.

Please share any similar experiences in the comments. I'd love to hear about other people's journeys.

2020-12-28 22:07:11,km07ve,8,1,"Covid lockdown has been a wild ride. I’m 27M (assigned male at birth), married to a wonderful (cis) woman who I’ve been with since high school. I have always self-identified and presented as a man my entire life. From the outside, things probably look about as “ideal” and “normal” as they can be, as far as societal norms go. We both have solid careers going, we have a house, we have a baby on the way, we’re about as fortunate and privileged as you can be at our age and I feel so lucky to be where I am in life with her by my side. I wanted to lay out this background because my story deals with societal norms and expectations, and I think this background context is an important part of where I’m coming from. Now, I want to write out a sort of journey I’ve recently undergone on a much more internal level, so here goes:

Starting a few years ago, I started to develop certain kinks that maybe hinted at some suppressed urges I had, but they were overall relatively tame and I didn’t really think too much about them when I wasn’t actively engaging in these kinks. (Really this was just limited to some light cross-dressing, wearing panties, and experimenting with penetration). I would always do these things in private, not involving my wife, because I felt ashamed and embarrassed. I had to literally force myself to admit to my wife that I ordered myself a toy because I figured she’d likely see the credit card bill or find it eventually. It was so hard to admit it to her but I eventually did, and she was very neutral about it. Very much a “do what you want, I don’t care” kind of vibe.

My wife and I have an incredible sex life, but as I’m sure is true of most relationships, there are some challenges that we’re working through together. She has a good deal of anxiety when it comes to initiating sex, and puts pressure on herself to perform, no matter how much I tell her I just want her to feel comfortable and that I crave intimacy, not sexual gratification. When we do break through that initial barrier, our sex is passionate and incredible. I would definitely call it somewhat “vanilla” in the grand scheme of things, but it feels really good, and we connect with each other emotionally in a way that I know I absolutely crave. Like, in the heat of the moment, I almost start to disassociate from myself, and instead start feeling like she and I are merging into one. It’s really hard to describe, but I absolutely love it, and I’m mentioning it here because I want to refer back to it a little later on.

Now, let me change gears to my more private, personal sexuality. My wife works long night shifts, which means that for a couple days of the week, she’s at work when I’m at home alone for a good 6-8 hours before I go to sleep. On some occasions, I take advantage of this alone time to really engage in what I’d call an “altered sexuality”. I feel differently about myself when I put on my wife’s lingerie than when I do when she is around. I still identify as the same person, with the same personality, but there’s a freedom to do what I want with no judgement that is thrilling. This thrill is very tightly coupled with arousal, which is why I’m describing this as an “altered sexuality” specifically. When I “finish up”, without getting too graphic, I put the lingerie away, I put on my normal clothes, I go back to my usual activities and way of thinking and feeling. I liked that it could be discrete, that I could hide all of the evidence before my wife got home, and nobody had to know about this embarrassing part of my sexuality.

So this pattern continued over the course of several years. With covid, the frequency increased, since I’m all locked down and working from home, but my wife is an essential worker who is still going out for her night shift job several times a week. Over the last week or so, the intensity of this sexuality felt like it increased, or maybe I was paying more attention to it, or letting it be more free or something. One evening about a week ago, while my wife was at work, I had a sudden, crazy idea - “what if I just shaved my legs?”. After all, it’s covid, nobody is going to see my uncovered legs for weeks, it sounds really exciting, why shouldn’t I? I knew I obviously couldn’t hide such a thing from my wife, so I texted her and said something along the lines of “for some reason, I want to try shaving my legs, I don’t know why but I think I’m gonna do it”. 

Her response was basically what I expected - similar to when I told her about ordering myself that toy, she basically said “ok, do whatever you want, doesn’t bother me”. So, I did it. As soon as I started, I felt the same kind of thrill that I felt the very first time I ever put on panties. It was this incredible sexual excitement and arousal. This felt like the next level of this ‘altered sexuality’ pattern that I’ve been engaging in. The only difference was that this time, I couldn’t hide all of the evidence when I was done. I couldn’t just put everything away and go back to my “normal self”, because my legs were still shaved! I had to live with them, and the crazy thing was, I liked that idea.

I started to look at and appreciate my legs in a non-sexual context. I liked how they looked and felt, not because it made me feel naughty and sexual, but because it made me feel like me, and I could actually look at part of my body and be proud of how it looked. This definitely felt like a revelation of sorts, but it was also scary too. I didn’t know what this was. Could I still call myself and think of myself as a man if I preferred my legs to be smooth and silky? What would my friends and family think of me if they found out I did this and liked it? I decided I had to do some research on reddit, since that’s what I’m often inclined to do when I want to know more about something new.

Now, I’m still not really sure if going to reddit right away was a good idea. I stumbled across subreddits like this one and was seeing an entire world of people, terms, and ideas that I didn’t understand. I’ve always identified as an “ally”, I’ve always tried very hard to stay educated and accepting of all types of people, but I admit I wasn’t aware that there was so much variety and terminology. I really wanted to find a ‘diagnosis’ for what I was going through. I came across some post or description of the term “genderfluid” and thought that maybe that’s what I was dealing with. After all, the word itself sounded like it could fit since I was sort of sliding into femininity with shaving my legs. But, after deciding that maybe I was genderfluid, I read another post that described genderfluid people as non-cis, and that if you aren’t cis, then you’re trans, by definition.

To be fully honest, this kinda terrified me. I don’t want to be trans, it doesn’t feel right to think of myself in that way. I think trans people are incredible, I think they’re some of the bravest, most courageous people on this planet, but I can’t think of myself in that group, or with that label. I know about other trans people who have described the trans experience, and I just don’t connect with what they’ve described at all. I don’t suffer from dysphoria, I’ve never wanted different pronouns or a different name than the masculine ones I use today, I don’t want to be a wife instead of a husband -- I am excited to be a father and a dad. But, I’m such a sucker for definitions and diagnosis that I thought “well shit, if liking my shaved legs makes me genderfluid, and being genderfluid makes me trans, then I guess that’s what I am even if it feels wrong to think of myself in that way”.

Another day or two went by and I was still grappling with this stuff in my mind. My wife, meanwhile, knew about the shaven legs, seemed totally fine with it, if not super excited by it. I started to work on a letter, in the mornings when she was still sleeping, because I knew that no matter what I was going through, I wanted to find a way to tell her. I wanted her help in figuring out what this was. So I worked on this letter over two different mornings, basically going over everything in this post so far, including my self-diagnosis of being genderfluid and the fact that this might mean I’m trans, even if I didn’t want to be.

My wife went to work another night shift. I distracted myself from the internal gender identity crisis I was going through by letting myself fall into that ‘altered sexuality’ mindset again. Instead of worrying about labels and diagnosis, I was once again focused on loving my body and the thrill of my new legs. I reshaved them to get rid of the stubble, and felt a sudden urge to paint my toenails. I decided to just do it, throwing caution to the wind. When I was finished, I of course loved how my feet looked, they looked pretty and sexy to me, and since I’m so unaccustomed to thinking of myself as being ‘attractive’ at all, this felt like even more evidence that yep, I guess I really am genderfluid. So, while my wife was at work, I sent her the letter, telling her that if she had some downtime, I wanted her to read it and let me know what she thought. 

I think the letter kind of scared her. My usage of the label ‘trans’ in the letter definitely made her uncomfortable, and I think she interpreted the letter as evidence that I might want to become a woman at some point in the future. She said that she was confused and couldn’t really tell what I wanted. She told me she was really worried that I would someday want to change myself with hormones, or change my body with implants, or change my voice, and that idea made her afraid, I think because doing those things would change who I am to her and of course that’s a scary idea. She wants to be in love with me for the rest of my life, she knows that she is in love with who I am right now, but what if she fell out of love if I completely changed as a person? I totally get it, and I know I’d grapple with the same type of struggle if the roles were reversed and she decided she wanted to transition to being a man. 

Anyways, her overall reaction to the letter definitely gave me a confusing mixture of feelings. On one hand, she seemed totally fine with me having a “feminine side”. She was excited to help me paint my nails, or try different hairstyles, or eventually do some ‘girly things’ together after covid like a spa day. That part of her reaction is awesome, and validating, and great. 

But on the other hand, she was definitely hung up about my self-diagnosis of genderfluid. I don’t know if she fully believes me when I say that I don’t want to become a woman, possibly because I was “okay” with using the term “trans” in my letter even if I didn’t feel that I can identify with it. 

I think the part that makes me feel a little bit bad about her reaction to my “coming out” letter is that now I have this lingering feeling, like, ok she might accept me for who I am today, but what if she ends up being right? What if 10 years from now I decide that I do need to transition or something? And what if I were to do that and she wasn’t able to completely accept me? I think she would try her absolute hardest but at the end of the day, it would be such a massive change in both of our lives that I wouldn’t blame her for not being able to do it. I try to tell myself that this is a silly line of thought though, that I shouldn’t worry about a version of myself that doesn’t currently exist. But it’s hard to completely ignore that tiny bit of worry. 

I think this is maybe a problem with trying to grab labels, terms, and definitions as diagnoses, especially so early into the process of questioning who or what you are. I’m not as educated as I can be on these issues, and neither is my wife. I feel like I had enough knowledge and awareness of gender issues to support that community as a cis straight man, but now that I’m questioning my cis-ness (and to be honest, also my straightness), it feels pretty overwhelming to try to find a label that matches my mindset, especially when that mindset is evolving and changing day by day. 

So anyways, back to the story: The next day, while my wife was asleep, I did a bit more reading, and came across a term I hadn’t seen before. This term was “gender non-conforming”, and it immediately resonated with me, I think because it seemed to describe actions instead of identity. Me shaving my legs is 100% a non-conforming action to take as a cis-man, and I know that I liked taking that action. I knew that I wanted to do more things that are non-conforming in the future, with my wife, and it felt right to want those things. I feel like identifying with this label gave me the freedom to want these new things without changing who I am fundamentally. I think this is what I thought gender fluidity was, but now that I have some understanding of both labels, I like ‘gender non-conforming’ a lot more.

It also gives me a feeling of empowerment: gender roles suck, I’ve always thought so (and so does my wife). By refusing to conform with some traditional aspects of masculinity, I’m demonstrating my displeasure with these societal roles, and I like how that feels.

When my wife woke up, we talked a lot more, and I think this conversation made us both feel better. I showed her what I read about “gender non-conforming”, and she agreed that that term made her feel more comfortable too. At the very least, it gives me something to think about myself that doesn’t scare me or my wife at all, which creates the freedom I need to explore this more.

We had sex that night, and it was incredible to get to feel open about myself. I took on a more submissive role than I ever have before, I unashamedly rubbed my smooth legs against hers, and kept thinking about how sexy my feet looked. It was incredible, and I also realized that the entire time, I wasn’t worried about whether I was having sex as a ‘man’ or as a ‘woman’. I was having sex as myself, fully and without any filter. If my body wanted to assume a submissive, feminine pose, I let it. If my body wanted to moan or make noises, I let it. If I wanted to grab her and switch to a more masculine position, I did so. It was a freedom I had only ever felt in my private, ‘altered sexuality’ sessions, but this time it was with the person I love and I wasn’t ashamed at all.

Remember way earlier when I mentioned feeling like my wife and I were almost merging into one entity when our sex was really good? In a way, I almost feel like this is happening on a broader, more permanent level. By freeing myself of all worry about my role and expectation based on my gender, it feels like I’m closer to her now than I ever have been, both sexually and non-sexually. 

For example, since shaving my legs, I’ve started to dislike a lot of my super masculine boxer-style underwear, and I asked my wife to help me shop for some new ones. I found a website that sells underwear purely by style and not by men/women categories, and it was such a great feeling to shop with my wife in a completely genderless mindset. We ended up each getting something with the same style (just different sizes), and it was somehow such a good feeling that she and I weren’t categorizing ourselves differently. I also picked out a thong for myself and just the fact that she was sitting there with me, helping me pick it out was so reassuring and affirming. 

I’ve learned so much about myself over the last week, and I know that I still have more self-discovery ahead of me. I wanted to share this because writing it all out helps me reflect on it, but also because I think there’s something to be said for the danger of reaching for labels and diagnosis, especially so early into a ‘questioning’ phase. When I finally let go of finding the perfect label or perfect term, and just focused on doing what I want to do, regardless of what that might define me as, I started finally feeling happy and able to share my full self with my wife.

Some day, I think it’d be awesome if I could build up the courage to show off this feminine side of me more publicly. But for now, especially when this is so new and different, I’m perfectly content to just be myself around my wife. I love her so much and I’m so glad I opened up to her. If you made it all the way through this, wow, thank you so much for taking the time to read about my experience.

And while letting go of labels and terms was helpful for me to keep exploring myself, if I said anything that is incorrect, or problematic in any way, especially about the terms and labels I described, please let me know! (Especially if I accidentally said anything that could be transphobic). I’m always looking to broaden my understanding of myself and other people. If anyone reads this story and feels like there actually is a term that fits very close to what I’ve described, I definitely would love to hear it. If anything, knowing which topics and labels I should read more about will only improve my understanding, as long as I’m not so eager to immediately apply them to myself. In general, I still feel like I’m actively “questioning” who I am, so if you feel like you have some insight after reading this, please do share it. Thank you so much!",genderfluid,"Came out to my wife, in a way. Still somewhat confused. Non-conformity, sexuality, label confusion, and self-acceptance",1609218431.0,"{'created_utc': 1609193231, 'id': 'km07ve', 'num_comments': 8, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Covid lockdown has been a wild ride. I’m 27M (assigned male at birth), married to a wonderful (cis) woman who I’ve been with since high school. I have always self-identified and presented as a man my entire life. From the outside, things probably look about as “ideal” and “normal” as they can be, as far as societal norms go. We both have solid careers going, we have a house, we have a baby on the way, we’re about as fortunate and privileged as you can be at our age and I feel so lucky to be where I am in life with her by my side. I wanted to lay out this background because my story deals with societal norms and expectations, and I think this background context is an important part of where I’m coming from. Now, I want to write out a sort of journey I’ve recently undergone on a much more internal level, so here goes:\n\nStarting a few years ago, I started to develop certain kinks that maybe hinted at some suppressed urges I had, but they were overall relatively tame and I didn’t really think too much about them when I wasn’t actively engaging in these kinks. (Really this was just limited to some light cross-dressing, wearing panties, and experimenting with penetration). I would always do these things in private, not involving my wife, because I felt ashamed and embarrassed. I had to literally force myself to admit to my wife that I ordered myself a toy because I figured she’d likely see the credit card bill or find it eventually. It was so hard to admit it to her but I eventually did, and she was very neutral about it. Very much a “do what you want, I don’t care” kind of vibe.\n\nMy wife and I have an incredible sex life, but as I’m sure is true of most relationships, there are some challenges that we’re working through together. She has a good deal of anxiety when it comes to initiating sex, and puts pressure on herself to perform, no matter how much I tell her I just want her to feel comfortable and that I crave intimacy, not sexual gratification. When we do break through that initial barrier, our sex is passionate and incredible. I would definitely call it somewhat “vanilla” in the grand scheme of things, but it feels really good, and we connect with each other emotionally in a way that I know I absolutely crave. Like, in the heat of the moment, I almost start to disassociate from myself, and instead start feeling like she and I are merging into one. It’s really hard to describe, but I absolutely love it, and I’m mentioning it here because I want to refer back to it a little later on.\n\nNow, let me change gears to my more private, personal sexuality. My wife works long night shifts, which means that for a couple days of the week, she’s at work when I’m at home alone for a good 6-8 hours before I go to sleep. On some occasions, I take advantage of this alone time to really engage in what I’d call an “altered sexuality”. I feel differently about myself when I put on my wife’s lingerie than when I do when she is around. I still identify as the same person, with the same personality, but there’s a freedom to do what I want with no judgement that is thrilling. This thrill is very tightly coupled with arousal, which is why I’m describing this as an “altered sexuality” specifically. When I “finish up”, without getting too graphic, I put the lingerie away, I put on my normal clothes, I go back to my usual activities and way of thinking and feeling. I liked that it could be discrete, that I could hide all of the evidence before my wife got home, and nobody had to know about this embarrassing part of my sexuality.\n\nSo this pattern continued over the course of several years. With covid, the frequency increased, since I’m all locked down and working from home, but my wife is an essential worker who is still going out for her night shift job several times a week. Over the last week or so, the intensity of this sexuality felt like it increased, or maybe I was paying more attention to it, or letting it be more free or something. One evening about a week ago, while my wife was at work, I had a sudden, crazy idea - “what if I just shaved my legs?”. After all, it’s covid, nobody is going to see my uncovered legs for weeks, it sounds really exciting, why shouldn’t I? I knew I obviously couldn’t hide such a thing from my wife, so I texted her and said something along the lines of “for some reason, I want to try shaving my legs, I don’t know why but I think I’m gonna do it”. \n\nHer response was basically what I expected - similar to when I told her about ordering myself that toy, she basically said “ok, do whatever you want, doesn’t bother me”. So, I did it. As soon as I started, I felt the same kind of thrill that I felt the very first time I ever put on panties. It was this incredible sexual excitement and arousal. This felt like the next level of this ‘altered sexuality’ pattern that I’ve been engaging in. The only difference was that this time, I couldn’t hide all of the evidence when I was done. I couldn’t just put everything away and go back to my “normal self”, because my legs were still shaved! I had to live with them, and the crazy thing was, I liked that idea.\n\nI started to look at and appreciate my legs in a non-sexual context. I liked how they looked and felt, not because it made me feel naughty and sexual, but because it made me feel like me, and I could actually look at part of my body and be proud of how it looked. This definitely felt like a revelation of sorts, but it was also scary too. I didn’t know what this was. Could I still call myself and think of myself as a man if I preferred my legs to be smooth and silky? What would my friends and family think of me if they found out I did this and liked it? I decided I had to do some research on reddit, since that’s what I’m often inclined to do when I want to know more about something new.\n\nNow, I’m still not really sure if going to reddit right away was a good idea. I stumbled across subreddits like this one and was seeing an entire world of people, terms, and ideas that I didn’t understand. I’ve always identified as an “ally”, I’ve always tried very hard to stay educated and accepting of all types of people, but I admit I wasn’t aware that there was so much variety and terminology. I really wanted to find a ‘diagnosis’ for what I was going through. I came across some post or description of the term “genderfluid” and thought that maybe that’s what I was dealing with. After all, the word itself sounded like it could fit since I was sort of sliding into femininity with shaving my legs. But, after deciding that maybe I was genderfluid, I read another post that described genderfluid people as non-cis, and that if you aren’t cis, then you’re trans, by definition.\n\nTo be fully honest, this kinda terrified me. I don’t want to be trans, it doesn’t feel right to think of myself in that way. I think trans people are incredible, I think they’re some of the bravest, most courageous people on this planet, but I can’t think of myself in that group, or with that label. I know about other trans people who have described the trans experience, and I just don’t connect with what they’ve described at all. I don’t suffer from dysphoria, I’ve never wanted different pronouns or a different name than the masculine ones I use today, I don’t want to be a wife instead of a husband -- I am excited to be a father and a dad. But, I’m such a sucker for definitions and diagnosis that I thought “well shit, if liking my shaved legs makes me genderfluid, and being genderfluid makes me trans, then I guess that’s what I am even if it feels wrong to think of myself in that way”.\n\nAnother day or two went by and I was still grappling with this stuff in my mind. My wife, meanwhile, knew about the shaven legs, seemed totally fine with it, if not super excited by it. I started to work on a letter, in the mornings when she was still sleeping, because I knew that no matter what I was going through, I wanted to find a way to tell her. I wanted her help in figuring out what this was. So I worked on this letter over two different mornings, basically going over everything in this post so far, including my self-diagnosis of being genderfluid and the fact that this might mean I’m trans, even if I didn’t want to be.\n\nMy wife went to work another night shift. I distracted myself from the internal gender identity crisis I was going through by letting myself fall into that ‘altered sexuality’ mindset again. Instead of worrying about labels and diagnosis, I was once again focused on loving my body and the thrill of my new legs. I reshaved them to get rid of the stubble, and felt a sudden urge to paint my toenails. I decided to just do it, throwing caution to the wind.

2020-12-31 03:21:56,knhqv5,3,1,"A while ago, I came to this sub asking about pronouns:

If on my girl days I like she/her, and they/them or he/him makes me dysphoric, and on my boy days I like he/him, and she/her or they/them makes me dysphoric, and on my neither/both days I only want they/them... How do I find a pronoun that works full time?

I made a similar post about names. My birthname is pretty femme, and I have a more masculine name I sometimes go by online or in my head, how can people know what I want to be called without reading my mind?

Well friends, I have the answer, and I am implementating it for the first time tonight. 

Bracelets. 

Bracelets with different colors. 

I have a pink bracelet for she/her, a yellow bracelet for they/them, and a blue bracelet for he/him. 

I have a purple bracelet for my birthname (femme name) and a red and black bracelet for my chosen masc name. 

I will wear the bracelets that apply to me at that moment. I can even change them multiple times per day!

I am testing this out with one safe person, and if it works I may introduce it to other people in my life. It alleviates any need for mind reading, but keeps me from constantly having to announce or remind anyone who I am that day. 

I hope this advice helps someone! Tomorrow is my first bracelet day.
