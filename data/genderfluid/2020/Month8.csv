Recently, I'm labelling myself as a genderfluid person, but I seem to be invalidating myself a lot due: I still ""feel"" like my assigned gender sometimes.

2020-08-06 01:28:07,i4ietj,6,1,"So, hello! I created this account just for my insane questions over my gender identity and sexuality. On this post I’ll focus on my gender identity crises...

I’m AFAB, 16 years old and I’m currently identifying as a genderfluid person. But I lately I’m really invalidating myself. I’ll tell more about myself, maybe that will help you who’s reading to help me. 

Since I was young, I always kinda got “uncomfortable” about being all girly but I never questioned that because of my parents (they’re very conservative and religious). Not that I’m not fine being called a girl/woman/feminine pronouns; I don’t have dysphoria over it. I’ve always wanted to have a more flat chest and have a “boy haircut”, that’s all. My body is fine (the “cis” thing, I’m unconfident about how my body looks only). And I get uncomfortable when my parents tell me I can’t because “I will look like a boy”. That’s when I get uncomfortable; not being able to be myself. 

I’m fine going by any pronouns when people call me. My first language isn’t english, and it has a really binary vocabulary (almost every word is gendered (female and male)). I feel sometimes weird calling myself with other pronouns, but I think that’s because I was raised as a female and to never question. It’s kind of a... shock of realities? I’m trying to be more open about pronouns and I’m liking it, even though I almost always rely on feminine pronouns. When I’m with others, I don’t keep questioning about my gender. But sometimes I slip and call myself as masculine or neutral pronouns instead of feminines. 

When I think about being in a relationship, I’m fine being called as a woman. But it makes me uncomfortable to lie that I’m cis. 

My given name never felt right to me, too. Kind of wrong, if that changes something. Online, I always use “codenames”, and those names feel... right to me (I’m using Ashwin now, and I love it!). 

About how I identify, that’s a little bit strange. I feel, yes, connected somehow to my assigned gender. Most of the time. And sometimes just a little. But there’s a part of me that is just nothing/neutral or a masculine-but-not-male. Or there are days that I just hide from myself and don’t want to question my gender and feel bad about myself the whole day. 

I’m really tired of all those questions inside my head. And my brain making me invalidate myself over and over again. It’s really tiring.

What am I? Am I normal? Am I just trying to fit into something? Am I just seeking for attention?

Can you guys help me, please? I can’t rest until I’m done with those questions in my head.

I have been really trying to figure out my place in the world over the past few years, bouncing from masculine to this feminine version of myself that keeps popping out.  I thought I was NB for a bit, but fluid actually feels right once I started looking into things.  Sometimes it’s just a little bit of the day, or I may wear panties that day instead of boxers, but lately I’ve been in my female mode more often than not.  I fully expect that to change like the tide in a day or two, but whereas I used to freak out about it, now there’s this calm acceptance.  

I came out to a friend the other day, and she has been super supportive and non-judge mental.  She has been thru similar things before and she had so many encouraging things to say, compared to what I feel most of my friends or family would say/do.  For now, I just keep things to myself, or discuss with her (she’s long distance so I can’t just hang out like I would like to😓), and that’s fine.  It’s just nice to be able to discuss things with someone.  I’m 39, and for once I feel like there’s this whole part of me who is able to relax a bit now rather than worry about what is going to happen if I act a bit femme in front of the wrong person.

Sometimes I hate the feminine feelings and wish I felt more masc...vise versa...sometimes I hate being in a feminine body...sometimes I feel iffy about it. I may be a mix of masc. and fem. plus other-ish...sometimes male and other...sometimes I feel super feminine....at first I thought I was androgynous but I kept feeling sort of different. I also wish I was a boy too a lot of the time like...I don’t FEEL like a boy but I wish I was one. I kinda wish I was a like a cute petite fem boy.

Hi there, everyone. I'm 21 years old and I have recently come to the realization that I'm genderfluid. I've been exploring what that means to me and I find my dysphoria and feminist ideals clashing at many times. Let me explain.

So I was assigned male at birth and therefore have a pretty masculine body and so, of course, there are times when I want to present as more feminine. This, for me, would sometimes include wearing things such as breast forms and hips padding to give the illusion of a more hourglass type figure. 

Where my gripe lies is in the fact that I'm unsure whether I'm doing this just for my own satisfaction or because it's what a more ""womanly"" body is expected and idealized to be and, therefore, it makes me feel better when I want to be perceived as more feminine. But I also think that, in the end, who's to say that my body isn't a woman's body, even without the padding?

I feel like I'm betraying my feminist ideals of ""If you are a woman, you have a woman's body,"" etc. and surrendering to the societal ideal feminine body. It's just that when I wear the padding and other accoutrement, it scratches some itch that I couldn't scratch otherwise. 

I'm really confused and I would really appreciate anyone's insight. Does anyone else struggle with this kind of conflict? What are your views on it?

I bought a pair of 300g [oval breast forms](https://www.sweetforbidden.com/collections/breast-forms/products/transform-natural-look-tapered-oval-forms-tf102) from Nearly Me Technology last December, one of which has developed a tear (\~5mm long) in the back plastic.

Ideally I’d want something that would keep the tear closed, even when I have to soak the forms to remove the adhesive tapes. Possibly superglue?

I’m also wondering if I’m removing the tapes correctly. The person I bought them from told me to soak the forms for a few hours, and the tapes would come right off. However, I often have to soak the forms overnight in order to make the tape easy to remove; is this normal?

I’ve also found that adhesive builds up on the back of the forms. I’m not sure if it’s separating from the tapes, or if it’s the skin tac I’m using to help keep them attached. The adhesive buildup is also hard to remove, and I have to run my nail against it when it’s wet to rub it off.

I'm in masc mode hard rn, it tends to generally drift over a season, with spikes of hard gender feels eveynow and then. Anyways, i have killer curves, I've been working towards looking like a guerdo from breath of the wild. I'm short and chonky and strong. But damn, my femme fat deposits are fucking with me hard rn.
I wish i could just pull all my femme bits off rn, but i know i don't want them gone forever, just for rn.
Anyways, does anyone else run into this?

I have wrestled with depression, panick attacks, dysphoria and currently acute stress syndrome.

https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/i2al7c/my_first_post_my_story_and_hi_to_yall/

This weekend I finally did it. I came out to my wife. I couldn't live with the secret any longer. I was a total mess - waiting any longer, I would have admitted myself.

I couldn't finish my first sentence without bursting into tears. 

She was so amazing. She held me, she assured me this was ok and nothing bad. After I got a bit calmer she brought me a dress that might fit. It was so validating! I cried again ^^

We had a smoke and toasted to the new life with whiskey. 

We talked and talked...

Of course there are still a lot of things to figure out. And of course she does struggle and it is not as easy for her as the initial support suggested.

But she is open to change. She is open to re-evaluate herself, soul-search if she could be bi, push her own boundaries and see that as a chance to squash some heteronormative chains herself.

She even bought me transparent nail polish because she thought it would be nice for me as something feminine I can wear in disguise.

My best go out to u/LeynaMichael, u/LaludeeMarn, u/AdrienneBee and u/DarrenorEmma as well as all the folks at the-apothecary.club #trans room for helping me through though times and finding my courage.

Xoxo

By no means is this meant to insult the genderfluid community, but i truly am confused and i feel the need to reach out for help. I hope you all can understand. Also, going into this post, keep in mind that i’m bisexual. 

So yeah this is something that has been bothering me a lot in the past few months. I would say that most of the time, if not all, i feel male. While i am naturally very feminine, much more than most males, i usually just accept the fact that i am just a feminine male. It’s worth noting though that maybe there have been a few times where i was just doing nothing and felt female but i’m not too sure, and the feelings were never too strong. 

However, when i’m aroused is when i can feel incredibly like a female. When i think about sex, sometimes i think about being a male for it, but i also think about female for it incredibly often. I feel like a woman when i masturbate, and i wish i didnt have the body that i do... Never in my life have i had to deal with dysphoria, but i’ve noticed that dysphoria is the only way i could describe how i’m feeling sometimes when i’m aroused. I understand that i could just be a feminine guy and be with a man, but when i’m in a mood where i feel like a woman, i hate the idea of that. When i think about being with a male sexually and i feel like a woman, i wish i had a vagina in that moment and that i could just be a woman making love to a man. While a bisexual male can be just as girly and get penetrated just like a woman can, i still want to be a woman, not a man. It just doesn’t feel right to be a male sometimes.

But i feel super invalid about this!! I have never really heard of a person feeling entirely like another gender only when they’re aroused, so i have no clue what to make of this. Could it just be some kind of weird fetish? i don’t know. Could it be some sort of genderfluidity? I don’t know!! Has anyone else dealt with this sort of thing or known someone who has? I would really love some sort of answers to this. There’s a part of me that feels like it’s not just a fetish since it genuinely brings on feelings of frustration and confusion when it happens.

I struggled with many things: unsupportive parents, a borderline physcologically abusive mother, Covid-19 preventing me from seeing some people who I love, and lots of internal struggle. Now don’t get me wrong, I don’t have nearly as rough a life as many others. In fact, mine’s pretty good. I’ve had it easy. Many others haven’t though.

Something which I thought could help me with this (either help me come to terms and accept my genderfluidity or become more certain that I wasn't genderfluid) was to tell some of my close friends how I feel, so that I wouldn't be trying to go through this with just myself (I know it is cliche, but I am my own worst enemy).

Unfortunately I find it really difficult to tell my friends, I don't really know when to tell them or how to bring it up.

I thought I knew my gender. I thought I was genderfluid but it doesn't feel completely right. But I will share my story.

I'm AFAB and been questioning my gender for quite a while now. I don't feel like a cis woman. If I'm thinking about my body I don't really like my boobs all the time. I don't want them but also think meh they are okay. If I'm thinking of the pronouns of he/him with me, makes me smile. The pronouns she/her are still okay with me. But if someone is saying Mrs. or madam to me it doesn't feel right. I like the man versions more. On thing is sure to me, the they/them pronouns is nothing for me. It doesn't feel right.

Lately I want to wear more man clothes. I really like the androgynous style, I think mine is that. I only wear sport bra's. I love that I have a little curf but not to much. 

A few weeks ago I got a new haircut. Like short, really short. I love it, it's the first time I ever loved my hair length. Now it happend a few times because of my hair length people thought I was a boy. That made me really happy.

I tried binding with layered sports bras and it sorta worked and it made me feel really great, but then I tried it another day and I hated it.

I need to get some stuff off my chest. So I'm 31 and AMAB. Until this past summer, I never really questioned that I was male. I mean yeah I knew some trans and non-binary people but that wasn't me, right? I was born male and that is what I was, or at least so I thought. Growing up I've never really been totally comfortable with my masculinity. I mean I have been attracted to some aspects of it but also to aspects of femininity. I remember when I was in preschool being so excited to play ""girly games"" with my best friends who were both girls. Starting around age 9 I started being bullied for not really fitting in with other boys, starting my long struggle with depression and social isolation. This was my first exposure to toxic masculinity and it made me surpressed any affinity I had towards feminine things. I would think to myself ""Oh. you want to be called beautiful? You want to wear a dress? You want to like cute little things? Etc... Better push that all down or else you'll catch hell."" I never had anyone tell me any different so this is how I lived and oriented my life. I just thought that was what people did. I thought that's what normal was. So that was my life. I got to through middle school and high school chronically depressed and isolated. Continued on through college still struggling with depression. Got married, bought a house. All the things a man is ""supposed"" to do. My depression and self loathing is still there. Then last year, My wife's friend invited my wife and I to a drag show at a local bar for pride. Never having been to one, I said sure why not. I sat in the show and watched all these people born men proudly dance and celebrate dressed as women and I was mesmerized. It was like the dam I had been building to hold back all my fem feelings started to crack and then finally broke. After the show, I started feeling compelled to dress feminine and so I started cross dressing. For the first time I finally felt free, liberated from this heavy load of having to maintain this image. Having to watch my mannerisms and language. Not having to worry about not projecting a masculine image. No longer hiding. 

Which brings me to today. Yes today is the day I have come to the final realization that I am not fully male. I am genderfluid.

I hope that some of you will have time to read the text below and give me some comments :) 
I don't feel I am trapped in the wrong body but I dont feel male even though I am born as one. The reason I think that I am a female is because I don't feel male in me. I can not explain it, no matter how much I try, I simply don't feel like a man should feel.

All of these thoughts started when I was high on weed few years ago. I have just came out as gay and I thought that all of my worries were gone, but... little did I know that my life would be one rollacoster with, as it now seems, no end to it. The sentence ""what if I was not gay but woman all along"" brought me anxiety depression, insecurity, mostly nothing good. I was diagnosed with mild depression and a went to therapy for a year and a half. Since I have started questioning my gender I have became selfdistructive person I have been in abusive relationship, used drugs, did everything bad I can think of, because it's hard for me to accept the possibility of being some other gender. The problem is I did not have a clue that I might be something else.
 Before coming out as gay, I used to think of my self as a cis male with more feminine traits (not physically but emotionally). I am 6'3"" tall guy I like my beard I like my short hair I can't stand when my nails are not cut. My favourite trait are my masculine legs and manly but cute face. I have always had problem with my hips I thought they looked wide and girly, also only few months ago ( I am 29 now) I have came to conclusion that my penis is not so tiny ( in my head it looked so small I was ashamed of it for the most of my life). Finaly I like the guy I see in the mirror, but I am not sure if I can relate to that image. It seems like I am looking at someone else. Honestly I dont want to be transrl, nor do I rationally want to be a female, I wish all this to stop and to be a cis male. I dont want to offend anyone with these words, but I dont find women attractive, I can objectively say if she is beautiful or not but that's it. But I feel feminine, I can't go against my self. The thing is that I can't relate to any male figure in my life. And than it seems that I have to accept the fact that I am not a man. I feel happy when i notice some manly traits in my behaviour but I don't see them often I wish I could l accept my feminine side without thinking I am trans, it seems that I can't.

For me is the transitory behavior we have switching to each gender.
But someone said that we define ourselves gender fluid, because of the impositions of stereotypes society gave to each gender, and that this is problematic.
Like the fact that when we feel more masculine we tend to have an aggressive behavior... they said that this should not happen, that we should fight against this typical stereotypes... 
And that if we feel a discomfort by being feminine we shouldn’t change to our masculine side just because we think we can behavior in a certain way by being in another gender...
The person basically invalidate the meaning of gender fluidity...

My question is for you guys the temporary transition to each gender, is based on the typical society constructions of how the genders should behave?

Please let me know if this post is not allowed and I will remove immediately.

My child (cis male, age 12) has come to me to discuss that they feel they are more gender fluid than either male or female and have asked me to help them become more comfortable.

2020-08-22 12:59:18,iehzng,4,1,"This was in the 1990's, at a major university in the American South.

I was exploring my gender identity, and came up with what at the time seemed bold and daring (and in the 1990's, in the South, and as a 19 year old, was pretty daring). I'm sure by modern standards it's nothing, but at the time it really felt liberating and like an accomplishment, like I was both being myself, and somehow pulling off something on the whole system.

My friends knew, more or less, that I had some kind of gender ""thing"" going on, but they (nor I) really had the words to describe it. The only words/terms that anyone seemed to be able to understand or find were ""transsexual"". . .but I wasn't looking to fully transition. . .or ""transvestite"" or ""cross dresser"". . .but it wasn't a sexual kink for me. . .or ""drag queen"". . .but I wasn't trying to be some exaggerated parody of womanhood. Terms like ""non binary"" or ""genderfluid"" simply didn't exist. If they did, they were obscure enough that I couldn't find them at the time and none of my friends in college had ever heard of them either.

In any case, this is a discussion I had with a my best friend one day:

Me: Did you know I've been dressing and living as a girl the whole week and nobody noticed.

Friend: No you haven't.

Me: Haven't I? Look closer. These are women's sneakers I'm wearing. Women's socks. I'm wearing women's underwear and a sports bra underneath this. These are women's jeans, this belt came from a women's department at a store too. This is a unisex T-shirt and sweatshirt I'm wearing. I'm always clean shaven with no facial hair, and I've got a ponytail down to the small of my back. Certainly seems like I'm dressed completely how a woman would dress.

Friend: Yeah, but girls wear skirts and dresses, they wear makeup and jewelry!

Me: What about (friendname) or (otherfriend) they don't do that? When's the last time you saw her in a dress? Or her in a skirt? Can you ever remember either of those girls with lots of makeup or jewelry? They only do that stuff on big dates or something formal or something.

Friend: Yeah, but well, there's more to it than that. Girls date boys.

Me: What about (yetanotherfriend), she's a lesbian. Girls sometimes date girls too. Anyway, I'm not dating anyone right now, so that's moot.

Friend: Bathrooms. Girls pee sitting down! Girls use the ladies room! Girls use different soaps and shampoos and deodorants and stuff!

Me: I haven't peed standing up in years, and I haven't used any public restrooms all week, by design, to avoid having to use a men's room. Have you ever looked in my bathroom? Do you know what shampoo, or deodorant I use, how do you know I'm not using products marketed towards women?

. . .we went back and forth like this for several minutes before I was finally able to make it clear that a lot of young ladies in our social circle were pretty tomboyish, but they were accepted as girls. . .but if I literally dressed the exact same way, groomed myself the same way, carried myself the same way. . .nobody thought of me as a girl.

I tried explaining to my friend that I'm not quite sure what I am. . .that I don't even know if a word exists for it (I think it does now, that would be either non-binary or genderfluid), but mentally, spiritually, emotionally I'm somewhere between male and female, sometimes more towards one than the other, and the very fact I can dress in entirely women's clothes, and basically live as a tomboyish girl for days or weeks at a time and nobody could felt like a real achievement.

Over time I talked to more of my friends about this and they were all equally shocked, like I was pulling some huge illusion, some big David Copperfield magic trick of switching genders before their eyes and them somehow not even noticing. One female friend of mine couldn't believe I was really dressed as a girl until I tugged the collar of my sweatshirt and T-shirt to flash my bra strap at her and a moment later put my thumb down my jeans to lift up the waistband of my panties. . .and then that got her to look CLOSER at my jeans and realize they were women's jeans, and look closer at things as I talked with her I got her realize that the line between how genders dress and act sometimes is closer than people think. That particular conversation went well, because that got her thinking and realizing that when you set the presumptions of gender aside, I never really ""acted"" like a male, and she stopped regarding me as a guy and started to treat me as ""one of the girls"", at least in private, which was one of the sweetest things any woman has ever done for me.

I'm sure it's nothing compared to what people do these days, but 20+ years ago, it felt revolutionary and liberating to step outside the strict binary and basically say ""boys can be tomboys if they want""",genderfluid,Living like a tomboyish girl for days or weeks in college and nobody even noticed.,1598126358.0,"{'created_utc': 1598101158, 'id': 'iehzng', 'num_comments': 4, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'This was in the 1990\'s, at a major university in the American South.\n\nI was exploring my gender identity, and came up with what at the time seemed bold and daring (and in the 1990\'s, in the South, and as a 19 year old, was pretty daring).

Do you know what shampoo, or deodorant I use, how do you know I\'m not using products marketed towards women?\n\n. . .we went back and forth like this for several minutes before I was finally able to make it clear that a lot of young ladies in our social circle were pretty tomboyish, but they were accepted as girls. . .but if I literally dressed the exact same way, groomed myself the same way, carried myself the same way. . .nobody thought of me as a girl.\n\nI tried explaining to my friend that I\'m not quite sure what I am. . .that I don\'t even know if a word exists for it (I think it does now, that would be either non-binary or genderfluid), but mentally, spiritually, emotionally I\'m somewhere between male and female, sometimes more towards one than the other, and the very fact I can dress in entirely women\'s clothes, and basically live as a tomboyish girl for days or weeks at a time and nobody could felt like a real achievement.\n\nOver time I talked to more of my friends about this and they were all equally shocked, like I was pulling some huge illusion, some big David Copperfield magic trick of switching genders before their eyes and them somehow not even noticing. One female friend of mine couldn\'t believe I was really dressed as a girl until I tugged the collar of my sweatshirt and T-shirt to flash my bra strap at her and a moment later put my thumb down my jeans to lift up the waistband of my panties. . .and then that got her to look CLOSER at my jeans and realize they were women\'s jeans, and look closer at things as I talked with her I got her realize that the line between how genders dress and act sometimes is closer than people think. That particular conversation went well, because that got her thinking and realizing that when you set the presumptions of gender aside, I never really ""acted"" like a male, and she stopped regarding me as a guy and started to treat me as ""one of the girls"", at least in private, which was one of the sweetest things any woman has ever done for me.\n\nI\'m sure it\'s nothing compared to what people do these days, but 20+ years ago, it felt revolutionary and liberating to step outside the strict binary and basically say ""boys can be tomboys if they want""', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'Living like a tomboyish girl for days or weeks in college and nobody even noticed.', 'created': 1598126358.0}"

Even when I was younger, lots of people used to call me a girl because my voice was higher, I have very feminine features like eyelashes my girlfriend would kill for and while I'm very tall I'm definitely not muscular, and I hated it back then, but I still had feminine interests as well, but I ignored them because I felt they were wrong to have and feared judgement.

But lately I've been doing a lot of introspection, trying to find my ""style"", and with it returned my desire to dress feminine on occasion, and it's jsut strengthened from there, beyond just wanting to look that way because it's fun, but that it actually feels right.

At the same time, sometimes I feel happier and more myself in male or masculine clothes, even though I'm told even my male clothes are very ""metrosexual"", to put it as my brother puts it.

This has just led me to feel like I'm genderfluid, but I can't help but doubt myself, that I'm not good enough, not different enough, or that I'm misattributing my feelings, like Imposter Syndrome in a way.

2020-08-24 10:47:42,ifmp5j,9,1,"I don't know why I'm writing this. Maybe I'm hoping to find some people who can relate.  


I'm a heterosexual man. I'm married and have two kids. From when I was a teen until about when I turned 30 I was always very skinny. I was never a manly man. I'd often get ""accused"" of being gay, have gay men come on to me, or similar. When I was a teen it bothered me a lot, because it was untrue -  I am hetero. When I grew older, it stopped bothering me. I knew who I was, and besides, what's wrong with being gay, even if I was?  


I'm now 40 years old. And the last couple of years I started getting teased when I was drunk. Without me realizing it, my voice apparently pitched up, and I sounded effeminate. To begin with I didn't understand why people would laugh at me. I wasn't aware of it happening. People who called my by the opposite pronoun, tease me with my voice (for instance by mimicking it). Gradually I started realizing that this apparently happened with my voice.   


I was very embarrassed. One thing was I did it, and opened myself up to ridicule. Another thing was that I just wasn't aware of it when it happened. I started losing friends I had had for ages. Either because they excluded me because they thought I was in the closet. Or I'd simply pull away because I felt humiliated by their bullying.   
Again my line of thought was and is: This is something I can't control, and because of that, nobody should judge me for it. I mean who's the victim? What evil am I doing? Shouldn't your friends accept you regardless?   


So, we had a big gathering last weekend. Lots of friends and family. The first night there, the teasing starts. It turns into bullying. I'm called ""fucking gay"". My brothers just laugh it, which to me makes them complicit. It continues into the next day. My sister-in-law tells me ""you are not a real man"". I'm starting to feel incredibly sad and miserable. At night, we were all supposed to make some songs for some games. I had arranged these games, so didn't take part, but would assign points etc.  


Anyways, the first song, they place a rainbow colored hat on my head, and the chorus include the lyrics ""come out"" (of the closet). So I'm standing there with a rainbow colored hat, while they repeatedly tell me to come out. Everyone is laughing, even my wife, who is an immigrant and didn't understand the meaning of the song. I get a full-on anxiety attack, the worst I've ever had. I barely get through the rest. I can't even add the numbers together for the points. And afterwards I take my youngest to bed, and stay with him until I got to sleep. The next morning I get up early and tell my wife, we should leave before breakfast, and I'll tell her why in the car. Which we do, and I tell her everything.  


She's as shocked and appalled as I am. I'm also devastated, that NOBODY came to me in confidentiality and talked with me about this. Apparently they just arranged my coming out party, without consulting me.  


The following few days I can't eat or sleep. Nobody calls to check on me. Thought it's totally out of character for me to go bed early (I'm the type who's last man standing), or leave without saying goodbye. I lost 7 pounds in a week. I've never been this depressed and shattered in my life. So I decide to write a letter to those implicated. I spend 3 days editing it. I sleep two nights on it, and finally send it out in a group chat. For once I would stand up for myself. I admit the letter wasn't written in a diplomatic way. I was furious, hurt and wanted to tell them exactly how they made me feel.  


The result? I'm told it's all in my head. Despite there being video of the song incidence. Nobody meant anything with it. I just had a freak-out. And I'm told that I just alienated myself from my family. And frankly, at this point I'm not interested in talking with any of them, unless they admit to what happened, at the very least. I'm not even hoping for any apologies.  


And that's where we are. I'm finally feeling a slightly better, because I have the full support of my wife. She's amazing wife. My children are unaware of all this, and spending time with them helps me put perspective on it all.  


I just needed to get this out. I've lost most of my friends over this. Friends I've had for more than two decades. My brothers have always been my best friends, and even they didn't stick up for me, just joined in laughing at me to my face. Now they trying to make a narrative that I'm crazy, to avoid more embarrassment. I have no idea where to go from here, other than focus on my wife and kids.   


Worst part is, part of me feels like I deserve it all. That since I'm the weirdo, they are in their right to bully, shame and humiliate me. But I remind myself that if it's something that I can't control, something that's part of who I am, then who is to blame? They can't condemn me for who I am, only for my actions. And the tone of my voice is not something I do, it's something that's part of who I am.  


Also, I'm going to have counseling with my psychologist tomorrow. I'm dreading having to go through the whole experience of tell her. I'm shit-scared she will somehow suggest that I might have misunderstood the whole thing. Though I don't really think she will. But I've just been told by my whole family that I'm basically crazy. Hearing and seeing things aren't there. And for the record I've never been psychotic or had delusions or hallucinations.

2020-08-25 17:38:03,iggy4v,2,1,"In the late 1990's, as a young person in college, I began to explore my gender and sexuality.

Words like ""gender fluid"" ""non-binary"" didn't exist back then, but they certainly would describe me.  My friends knew I was different about gender, but they were generally cool with it.

My mother was one of those moms that tried to be your friend, said she was your best friend, would say things like ""you can tell me anything"" and ""You can always come to me, I'll always understand.""

Well, at the age of 19, living in an apartment off campus my sophomore year of College, I decided to cash that ""you can tell me anything"" card, and I wanted to talk to my mother about my gender.  I wanted to stop hiding it from her, I wanted my mother to be supportive.  I wanted to be able to go shopping for skirts and dresses with my mom and not feel the need to hide half of who I am every time I was around her, I had fantasies of maybe having some mother/daughter time with my mom.

One rainy, cold January morning I sat down in her car when she came to pick me up at my apartment because she wanted to go out for breakfast.  I told her I wanted to talk to her before we went anywhere.

I tried, fumblingly, awkwardly, to tell her about how I didn't feel entirely like a ""boy"" or a ""guy"", about how I liked to blur the lines about gender, about how I sometimes liked to dress and act as a girl, sometimes I didn't, sometimes I wanted to be something in-between, and gave some examples of things I'd done, like wearing a mixture of clothing from both genders, or at least sometimes dressing up as a girl around my more open-minded friends.

""Are you trying to tell me you're gay?""

I had to explain that I wasn't attracted to men.  I also had to explain to her that I didn't want a sex change.  I kept trying to explain how I felt.  Words like ""non binary"" or ""gender fluid"" simply didn't exist at the time, or certainly didn't exist in society to be common enough for this conversation.

Then, in the middle of all this she gets a look of horror.

""You're. . .*a gay transvestite*??!?""

No mom, I'm. . .

At that point, my mom started freaking out.  The words ""gay transvestite"" were the only thing she could come up with to describe what I was saying, as ridiculously inaccurate as it was and she fixated on those words.

She then started to freak out, and beg me, plead with me to never, ever, EVER tell anyone, EVER about any of this.

She said she was sure that if I told anyone, that all my friends would ostracize me (most of them already knew and were cool with it), that'd never be able to find a girlfriend or get married, that I'd be permanently unemployable as it would forever ruin my reputation with every employer in the country and that I ""couldn't even get a job digging ditches or scrubbing toilets"" and that I'd be a pariah on campus and get expelled from the university because ""no respectable university wants some transvestite *pervert* going to it.""

She then told me that if word got out, I might well even be thrown in the state mental hospital.  She started saying that if word of this got out, they'd send an ambulance for me and I'd be committed to a mental hospital and probably lobotomized and/or castrated.

I tried to tell her that they don't involuntarily commit people to mental hospitals over matters of gender or sexuality, but she said ""everyone knows"" they do that.  I tried telling her that they certainly don't lobotomize or castrate mental patients anymore even if they did, she said she'd seen it in movies and TV shows so she **knew** they did that (my mother got most of her ideas about the world from movies and TV shows).

She also begged me to never tell me father, who was a retired military officer, very conservative, and wouldn't understand.  I agreed, there was a reason I thought I could go to my mother and not my father.

She was acting like I was trying to come out of the closet to the whole world in 1950 or 1960, not to come out to a family member in 1999.  The thing was, when I was growing up, she said things that seemed pretty LBGT accepting, especially for the 1980's and 1990's.  I'd never have expected her to say such utterly outrageous things now.

Eventually she calmed down, relatively, and with tears streaming in her eyes she said she didn't want to go out for breakfast, like was the original plan, and instead just wanted to go home.  She drove home, nearly got into an accident several times, and called me when she got back to both say she got home safely, and blame me for upsetting her so much that she ran two red lights and almost drove off the road once.

We never talked much about it after that.  She only ever mentioned it a few times after that.  

When I mentioned I saw a therapist once for a depression screening (my friends were concerned I was depressed), she asked, in hushed and secretive tones ""did you talk about. . .*cross dressing*.""  I told her that I'd briefly mentioned my gender issues to the therapist, who said that if I wasn't distressed by them, that they were nothing that warranted his attention.  That puzzled her totally, like it was so unexpected she just couldn't believe it.  

She only ever mentioned it one other time, many years later when she was divorcing my father and I refused to take my mother's side in the divorce, instead trying to stay neutral in the conflict, she tried to turn my father against me by telling him I was a ""gay crossdresser"" as my dad put it. . .which he promptly ignored because my mother was prone to making outrageous claims and absurd allegations during the whole process, so he just wrote it off as more of her ranting.",genderfluid,"No mom, they won't throw me in a mental hospital for being genderfluid. . .",1598402283.0,"{'created_utc': 1598377083, 'id': 'iggy4v', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'In the late 1990\'s, as a young person in college, I began to explore my gender and sexuality.\n\nWords like ""gender fluid"" ""non-binary"" didn\'t exist back then, but they certainly would describe me.

Like I love my body and I don’t really get body dysphoria. One of my non-binary friends said “I like my boobs I just don’t want people to know I have them” and that is such a mood for me. 

Anyway I have one in mind, when taking shipping into account it’s like $40+ (USD). It’s a underworks binding bra. The reviews said it runs small. I think technically imma 32B but I think a 34B might be better for me. Like I have two of the same Calvin Klein razor back bra and the cups on the 32B fit perfectly but around my...ribs? Anyway the band that goes around is a wee bit snug. Even though the 34B cups are ever so slightly too big the band fits perfectly so it’s more comfortable. 

Here’s the one I’m thinking of getting: https://www.underworks.com/extreme-magicotton-sports-and-binding-bra

I pet sit and I just got a good tip from my last client so I think I can afford a $40USD bra. Though I don’t usually like spending more than $30 in one go. However before I for sure get the underworks one like to see if I find other better options first. 

So I have two questions. 

1. If anyone has used the bra I’ve linked, how well does it work for you? Would it be good choice? 

2. If anyone here binds using a sports bra do you have any recommendations? Like a specific one from target? Or from a different brand? I wish I could just go to stores and try them on in person but given the global situation I have to stick to online stuff.

To give some background, I’ve experimented with crossdressing in the past and do it fairly regularly now. I’d say most of the time it is for sexual gratification, but there’s also a lot of times that it relieves stress and I just feel comfortable “dressing up.”

This started when I was 5 and dressed in my sisters ballerina costume and my mom found me. I didn’t do it much after that as it was embarrassing. I was an emotional kid and didn’t always feel like “the guys,” but had a lot of male friends that I was close with. I dressed in my sisters clothes a few other times when I was a kid but never thought past it until a few years ago. As I started to grow up, I got more friends, mostly female. I felt more close to them than male friends and really bonded with them. 

Then in the past few months, I started crossdress more and started to reflect on it and realized that I enjoyed being more feminine and wasn’t always sexual aroused. Just enjoyment of trying new things and experimenting. I liked when I did my makeup and how I looked in different clothes. I told my girlfriend, who was very excepting of it (thank god she’s bi and loves fem-boys). I have some dysphoria (mostly in my butt/thighs as I have a very slender ass), but it isn’t that intense as I’ve read on some posts here. I’ve got long hair, and am generally hairy, but will occasionally shave my legs and armpits if I’m feeling like it.

Some days, I feel very masc and enjoy presenting myself that way. Some days, I feel more feminine and don’t know how I can present that way with my current life (although it is not as important to me to present that way in public atm).

I know this is more questions I should be asking myself than anyone here, but I’m just wondering if anyone else feels this way and could help me get a better understanding on how to understand myself. Sometimes I feel like I’m genderfluid/genderqueer, other times I feel like I’m lying to myself and making it all up. What advice do you guys have?

TLDR: I’ve crossdressed in the past, mostly for sexual gratification, but have recently started to realize that it’s something more than that.

2020-08-28 22:40:45,iih86w,0,1,"I'm born female. Have been made to present that way for decades. But I always had a thing at the back of my head saying that what if I could be male or androgynous.

I had a lot to think about when this plague started. I've realized a lot of things like I'm not bi but pan because gender never mattered to me or what's in your pants or skirt (or kilt) and I decided to embrace my more masculine side too.

I've always loved male clothes, I just feel so comfortable in them. Like second skin. But I've been drilled the cis female into me for sooooo long. My family, who I don't speak to, still don't know I'm not straight. They never thought my girl friends were girlfriends. Not that they met many.

But I've always been told what is 'normal' and 'acceptable.' And I thought I was a freak of nature before my bi realization back in high school. Just because, at that time, there was no pan. And no genderfluid.

Now I feel like a freak all over again. And I'm afraid people will freak if I show my masculine side. If I dress as a man or a thing in between.

I first came out to a friend and she is the type of person that's not into labels so it went with advise that I don't have to adhere to labels.

Then I came out to my husband. That was the hardest thing. We're non-monogamous and we had a partner that was also genderfluid. But she had many problems at the time and he is mildly stereotyping because that's the only other genderfluid person he knows. We had a sit down and me explaining how I feel and felt. We had many more afterwards. It's been a few months.

Husband doesn't get it because he's a cis male and that bad taste in mouth incident. I try really hard to explain. But he doesn't get it.

He asked me how should he behave when I'm masculine and he's never seen my masculine side. I present female in front of him sometimes in between but never masculine.

I'm embarrassed and maybe ashamed of it. Not sure. But I'm terrified of rejection. In therapy for that. But my new therapist doesn't know where I'm at yet. Not at first session yet. The rejection is terrifying.

He asked me how she should behave and pretty much said he's not sure about calling me a he if I wanted that. I don't know. I really don't.

I've gone out just by myself as male presenting. I kind of came out to my mother-in-law, she seen me male presenting but thought I was just wearing baggy clothes and not obvious female clothes and didn't think much of it. I enjoyed that fact. But she doesn't know. Hell, her figuring out and forgetting I'm bi was a thing. Especially a week before the wedding. It was...a face palm moment.

Luckily, I've a binder now (because boy do I need it) and face masks tend to hide a lot of face when I'm not feeling confident or afraid. 

I just...it's hard. I usually don't worry about what people think but this is all new and terrifying.

If this isn't the what you guys are about, delete it. 

I'm a 32 yo male, and I have been married to my beautiful wife for 5 years. We have 3 children (2 are mine, 1 is a stepson but that's irrelevant) We met when we were teenagers, broke up. and then got back together 9 years later. She never had any idea of my feelings. Hell, I didn't either until several months ago. 

When I was younger I always had these feelings. I kept them to myself but they were always there. I wanted to feel pretty. I wanted to dress in cute girly clothes and do my makeup and just be able to be girly sometimes, even if only for a little while. Some days I woke up and I didn't feel like (name redacted). I felt like a prisoner in my own body. I felt like a woman. But for so many years I just kept them in a closet and they were nothing more than butterflies in my tummy whenever I felt the urge to be or feel ladylike. Fast forward to early 2020. My wife and I decide to try new things in the bedroom. We bought handcuffs, vibrators, dildos, and she mentioned pegging. So we went about finding a strap on for her. She wanted something that would penetrate us both so she could get physical stimulation out of the act. Blah blah. Several hundred dollars and failed toys later we found what was right for her, and when we did the deed, it opened that closet that I had been keeping my feelings in... Still too afraid to admit my truth even to my wife I kept it locked up. Sometimes when I was alone at home I would take cute selfies with a Snapchat filter, or look through my wife's wardrobe imagining how this dress or that crop top would look on me. I never tried them on, that would be crossing a line.

The other day, after I had been drinking and my wife had gone to bed. She texted me wanting to talk about nothing in particular. I was on my computer looking at clothes and sexy underwear, things I could imagine myself wearing before our special time in bed... So I decided this was my moment. I don't have the courage to say these words to her face so I said it in texts. Only, I didn't know the words to use. I didn't know exactly what these feelings inside me were or how they would manifest if I let them out. So I tried my best....

I am a man but sometimes I feel like maybe I'm not. I said a whole bunch of things that maybe didn't make much sense to her or in general. She didn't quite grasp what I couldn't tell her, and all she could really say was ""do you want to be a woman?""

""Maybe sometimes. I don't know, I haven't properly explored these feelings. I don't know exactly what I want.""

""I don't want to say it because I feel like it would make me sound like a terrible person.""

She said she's not a lesbian. And I didn't know what to say. I mean.... Most of the time I don't feel like a woman? All of the time I still have a penis. She cried. I was destroyed. I feel like I've hurt her so badly. Am I even the same person when she looks at me? I am still the same person when I look in the mirror, but some days I just don't feel like him. Some days I'm her. Whoever she is.

I'm in the middle of what feels like a hurricane of emotions right now. The next day we sort of avoided talking about it.... And I was just drowning in these thoughts... Who am I? What am I? Who does she think I am? 

We talked about it today. She says she supports me, but she's still just trying to process. And I understand that. I don't know what I would do if that bomb were dropped on me. 

But after what feels like an eternity of hiding these feelings that for so long I didn't understand, I finally feel like I have a little clarity, even if it's in the face of what could become a huge rift in my marriage. I woke up today and didn't feel like a man in my own body.

in germany we have to make a presentation in any subject we want in order to pass our abitur (graduation). i chose sports! and i am super interested in gender equality, different gender identities and i consider myself a feminist. 
i want my presentation to be about the treatment of trans* people in sports bc i am super interested in that and i think i could educate many people with that.
and now the problem: i am a cis woman, so i can’t judge that properly. 
that‘s why i want to make a question sheet with questions i could give some trans* folks to fill out, because i want to base my presentation on real life experiences. 
that’s where you would be able to help me: what kinds of questions could i put on that sheet to get the most information as possible about trans* people being treated in sports without being insensitive or inappropriate or intrusive?

So I wanted to ask some questions to get some insight on what it’s like to be gender fluid from people’s point of view. 

Some questions may seem obvious, as I could just look them up, but I would much rather hear it from gender fluid people other than from a website . 

Some questions may also be personal, so if your willing to help me with better understand genderfluid, there’s no pressure in needed to answer every single below if your not up to it. 

ANYWYAS! 

Questions:
- What does being genderfluid mean? (To you) 

- What are some struggles you face on a day to day basis? 

- What bathroom do you us? : One associated with you born sex, one associated with your opposite sex, you just hold it in, you use the disabled toilets, or just the gender bathroom that you’re feeling that day?

- What are some miss information that gets thrown around with gender fluid people?

So for about 2 months I've realised that I'm gender fluid (I'm a 17yo Amab and have been having issues of gender norms and identity for another month on top of the past 2), and one of the things that has been causing me grief recently has been my hair, since I have a pretty typical male haircut: number three shave back and sides, and combed over and up. I like my hair when I'm male, but whenever I feel femme, it just makes me feel super dysphoric. I've been tossing between growing my hair out, getting an androgynous haircut, and getting a wig, but I don't really know where to start with those options. Any advice on what I should do, or how to deal with the dysphoria?
