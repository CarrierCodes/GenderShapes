Even though I couldn't finish the show, I guess it hit home so much because I wish with all my being that I had been born male. While I present myself as a tall, thin, softly feminine ex-varsity soccer player I am incredibly unhappy with my gender. 

When I was little my catchphrase was ""I wish I was a boy"" and I made a point of avoiding all things deemed 'girly' my parents were great in letting me explore. Even after growing out of that general 'I want to be a boy' thought, I was quite a tomboy up until high school where I gradually feminized myself, mostly to fit in and mostly because I guess I had convinced myself that it was what I wanted.

Fast forward to college and I settled more into myself, donning a more tomboy-chic but still feminine fashion style. Any gender identity thoughts tucked away.

Then I got a girlfriend last April, and she was bi and leaned more towards men. Like a freight train it just opened the floodgates of apparently suppressed desire to be male, it probably didn't help that I knew if I had a male physique she would have been all over me.

Fast forward to yesterday, and she tells me she hasn't even noticed we'd been dating 5 months, and that lately she's been thinking she likes hanging out with me as more of a friend than a girlfriend. Calling me ""literally her best friend right now"" We never had sex, I never even got her shirt off because she would get uneasy and respecting her feelings I more or less kept the physicality to a level that wasn't too heavy or intimate. We only even had a heavy make-out session maybe 3 times max.(complicated, this is the short version)

I should have let those red flags tell me to drop it but I kept her around because aside from anxiety towards removal of clothing/sex she never behaved in a way that made me think she was possibly doubting things. She was always affectionate. 

I guess...now I've just sunk into this depressive self-loathing state because I know things would be different with her if I were male. It's hard to accept yourself when every part of you is screaming to get out, but you cant escape your own skin so theres nothing to do.

I don't know what to do, I feel like I'm collapsing into myself. 

I've considered transitioning (I'm 21) but at the same time my gut feels like I wouldn't be happy with a medical fix, I want it to be natural 100% and I know I can never, ever have that. So here I am stuck.

Like a freight train it just opened the floodgates of apparently suppressed desire to be male, it probably didn\'t help that I knew if I had a male physique she would have been all over me.\n\nFast forward to yesterday, and she tells me she hasn\'t even noticed we\'d been dating 5 months, and that lately she\'s been thinking she likes hanging out with me as more of a friend than a girlfriend. Calling me ""literally her best friend right now"" We never had sex, I never even got her shirt off because she would get uneasy and respecting her feelings I more or less kept the physicality to a level that wasn\'t too heavy or intimate. We only even had a heavy make-out session maybe 3 times max.(complicated, this is the short version)\n\nI should have let those red flags tell me to drop it but I kept her around because aside from anxiety towards removal of clothing/sex she never behaved in a way that made me think she was possibly doubting things. She was always affectionate. \n\nI guess...now I\'ve just sunk into this depressive self-loathing state because I know things would be different with her if I were male. It\'s hard to accept yourself when every part of you is screaming to get out, but you cant escape your own skin so theres nothing to do.\n\nI don\'t know what to do, I feel like I\'m collapsing into myself. \n\nI\'ve considered transitioning (I\'m 21) but at the same time my gut feels like I wouldn\'t be happy with a medical fix, I want it to be natural 100% and I know I can never, ever have that. So here I am stuck. \n\nSorry for the rant.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'This OITNB quote resonated with me.', 'created': 1381107375.0}"

Started wearing women's clothes only recently; long hair, small boobs, kind of androgynous face and voice.

And here are some of the things she said:

""I think it's pretty normal for women to think about [having a penis], especially if they are really empathetic [like you]."" There was something about the uber sensitive clit and ghost feelings in there too.

To follow that up: ""I had those feelings too."" She's cis, for reference.

""You should talk to [name of one of her friends who has expressed feelings semi-similar to mine]."" 

""What do you want me to do? I don't feel qualified to help you. You [have a much better knowledge base for dealing with this].""

I really don't know how I feel about how she has responded so far, and I am feeling a little less confident coming out to other important family members (ha! That implies I was ever confident about this!). How do I respond to my mom? I know she's trying to be supportive, but I want understanding too, and I'm not really feeling it.

For my entire life I felt kind of different, we can all agree that I've never been normal so this is no surprise. For the last year or so I've stopped ignoring the feelings and have started to really pay attention to them. It sucks and I hate every single thing that these feelings have taught me. If I could not be this way I most certainly would, believe me. It's literally my most hated thing. 
Mom has noticed that I've been struggling a lot lately, dad maybe you have too, I don't know. Mom you've been asking me what's wrong and I keep saying either ""nothing"" or ""same old same old"" because I really don't want to hurt anyone. I've realized though that this is my life, and sometimes what happens in my life will hurt other people but if those people love me than they love me for me and not for anything else. 
My entire life I've been struggling with both my sexuality and gender. Almost a year ago I came to terms with my sexuality and I'm pretty sure everyone as pretty much accepted it's not going to go away at this point. 
The thing I'm messaging you about right now is that my gender identity, or lack thereof, has caused me serious issues. The term I kind of started using to describe myself is gender queer (I'm going to include the wikipedia page link for that at the bottom of this). I don't know if that's true though. I've been talking to a lot of people and doing a lot of research and self reflection and quite honestly I'm terrified I might be transgendered (that would be the part I hate, there will also be a link for that at the bottom, its not as scary as it seems i swear). I don't know what or who I am though, and right now I just need support because i don't think i can do it on my own anymore. 
I just know that I actually despise myself, I don't think a person can ever hate me as much as I hate myself. Only since I started accepting my gender shortcomings I kinda feel a bit better. 
I don't know what I'm going to do about it, but yeah, now you guys know.

The term I kind of started using to describe myself is gender queer (I\'m going to include the wikipedia page link for that at the bottom of this). I don\'t know if that\'s true though. I\'ve been talking to a lot of people and doing a lot of research and self reflection and quite honestly I\'m terrified I might be transgendered (that would be the part I hate, there will also be a link for that at the bottom, its not as scary as it seems i swear). I don\'t know what or who I am though, and right now I just need support because i don\'t think i can do it on my own anymore. \nI just know that I actually despise myself, I don\'t think a person can ever hate me as much as I hate myself. Only since I started accepting my gender shortcomings I kinda feel a bit better. \nI don\'t know what I\'m going to do about it, but yeah, now you guys know. \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genderqueer\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_man\n\nThis took a lot of courage to send to you, I need to be studying now and probably won\'t be able to talk about it until after my exam on wednesday. That should be enough time for you guys to really process what just happened. \nI also feel disconnected with my name, but I don\'t have any plans of changing it (not legally, just like something to be called) anytime soon. \nlove you guys.

The responses were really nice and helpful, so I thought I'd come to you with another question: Since last time I have mentioned these feelings to my therapist (Note: not the original reason I went to her, I just started therapy for my social anxiety), and she said while of course this might be genuine and that'd be completely fine, it might be the case that I'm just going through a phase of questioning my sexuality and role, as is apparently not that uncommon, and that it might be best to wait for a while and see how I feel later. Especially since it might be connected to my social anxiety, as sort of a way for my subconscious to avoid social expectations by changing my gender role.

The thing is, I don't feel like this is the case; I've only had these feelings of transsexuality for about 2 months consciously, but in my opinion they explain a lot; before puberty I didn't really care about my body, during puberty it just felt kinda awkward and uncomfortable the whole time, and now I'm just getting more and more unhappy with it.

It seems to me that I finally found out why I was never proud of or comfortable in my body in my whole life, and I don't want to waste time anymore if it could be so much better if I just went ahead and followed through with it, especially since transition would probably work better the younger I am (19 right now).

Has anyone here ever actually gone through such a phase or has some helpful opinion otherwise?

However, it took me nearly two decades to come to terms with the fact that I am not comfortable being female-bodied.

I started binding nearly a week ago and I am loving it so much. I love binding, it has made me feel so much better about myself and my body. I actually feel confident in my appearance every time I see a flat chest on me. I am 100% certain that I want to get top surgery when I am older and can afford it. However, I'm not exactly sure how I feel about going on T.

I am pretty masculine-appearing already: I am short, but heavy--most of my weight is due to muscle. I'm hairy and don't shave: I have a happy trail (which before would make me feel bad, but now I actually like it a lot and I'm glad that it's there) and have a little moustache going on. I also have a deep voice already. So I feel like I don't need T. However, I want to have more defined muscles. I know that females have higher fat percentage than males. I feel like no matter how much I work out/how much weight I lose, I wouldn't get the defined look that I want without T. But I feel like I shouldn't need it because I'm pretty masculine-appearing already.

I also have seen, however, that a penis starts forming with T. And for as long as I can remember, I have always wanted one. So now I'm questioning whether or not I should go on T...

I guess my question is what do you recommend? What are things to be aware of when considering it? One of my best friends is a trans man and has been on T for nearly a year now. He's told me about the changes that he's gone through (acne, voice changes, mood swings, etc.) and they kind of make me scared to go on T.

About two months ago, I told myself I'd start playing with identification as genderqueer. I've been out as various queer identities since I was 16 - I'm almost 20 now - and I've been a really involved trans ally for most of that time. I was always just cis and that was cool - I actually loved the process of learning to check my privilege and learning about others' experiences. But as I got older/more involved, I kept having stuff to share from my own experience (but kept quiet because it felt like I was appropriating trans experience). I had always accepted my gender, though with a grim kind of fatalism - I was one of those girls building camaraderie with other women over how terrible it was to have boobs/period or be weak/cold/emotional/etc. When I started coming to terms with how messed up that was, I just thought it was internalized misogyny. But the more feminist I became and the more I learned to love femininity (in the abstract, in other people, in myself), the more dysphoria I had.

I felt terrible about using the word ""dysphoria"" when it first occurred to me that it applied. For one, I don't have the crippling depression symptoms my binary trans friends have. I didn't really think about gender other than in terms of vague annoyance until I started learning about it and getting involved with the LGBT world... and when I did, I was hooked, I couldn't get enough of researching and reading and whatever. I cannot shake the feeling that I did this to myself - that because I started learning about it, I'm straddled with this now and can't go back.

See, I thought I was just experimenting with an identity label when I came out genderqueer to myself, and when I tried drag for the first time, and when I played around with masculine and neutral names. But then I got hooked. It just felt so right and it was so validating that no matter how ... tolerable any dysphoria I had before had been, I couldn't get it off my mind anymore because I'd seen/felt the alternative.

So now I actually can't go out without binding - even in a sports bra - without wanting to rip my chest off. I've had dreams that I just decided to give myself top surgery. Every time I walk past a door or a window or a mirror and I see the curves of my hips I want to punch something. I have to wear a dress for choir and can barely concentrate on the music, as much as I adore it, because I'm so uncomfortable. I get numb and quiet and angry when I'm treated like a cishet girl. I'm suddenly starting to feel uncomfortable with my birth name. I thought I was just exploring options or having fun or exercising freedom before, but now I can't go back without feeling like shit.

I never had such masculine emotions before I decided to be open to questioning my gender, either. The change feels so biological that I just don't have any idea where it's coming from - it's like my imagination boosted my endogenously-produced testosterone levels. Is that even possible?

I guess it's just that with all the Born This Way culture, and having spent so much time falling in love with trans people/the way I've seen them align their bodies with something they intuit with near-complete certainty, I just don't see anyone with my kind of experience around me.

I am currently involved with a genderqueer person (I am a cisgendered female and identify as a lesbian). I would not go so far as to call them my partner, but they are certainly a huge part of my life and I care for them very, very much. 

They have been experiencing a lot of dysphoria lately, and it really sucks. I can tell that it upsets them more than they let on, and I hate that I can't be there more for them (LDR). I try my hardest to make them laugh and remind them that non-binary-gendered people are just as awesome as anyone else. They seem to feel better after these conversations, but I'm never totally sure. 

I screenshotted parts of our earlier conversation (blurring out names and some *ahem* ^^lovey-dovey stuff) when they were experiencing some intense dysphoria. (Sorry about my stupid humour, I kinda got a bit off there for a minute.)

I know that this question comes from the sincerest of places, and I really do understand why it's the best way to ask for relevant information. 

But it makes me feel really anxious. It makes me sweat. It makes me start hedging and trying to avoid answering. Because my answer to that specific question is complicated. If I was asked, ""What is your gender identity?"" well that's a simple answer. I identify as genderqueer. 

Pronouns? Well sometimes I prefer masculine, sometimes feminine, sometimes neutral. All depending on my mood. And which one is appropriate is not always reflected by my mode of dress or mannerisms or any cue others could easily use to tell. I dislike feeling the need to choose a pronoun almost as much as I dislike feeling the need to choose a gender.

More to the point though, I don't want to be a pain. I don't want my friends to stress about how they refer to me. I also don't want my gender to be something they have to actively think about every time they talk about me. And I personally feel like given the rarity of neutral pronoun use in English, asking for them puts far more emphasis on my gender than I'm comfortable with. Except that neutral pronouns are the best compromise I can find. 

So what I normally find myself saying in response to the pronoun question is, ""Whatever is easiest for you."" And I know that ends up being a totally unhelpful cop-out, but I just can't bring myself to request anything specific. 

Does anyone else have issues with the pronoun question? Should I just suck it up and ask for neutral pronouns given they're an OKish compromise for me? I mean, if they're aware enough to ask the question, surely they're okay with respecting whatever I request?

I came out to my family not too long ago, I can't actually remember when though, I don't think it's been a year but I do think it has been over several months and they say they will support me but to be quite honest, they've made little attempt to call me by my desired and now legal name or use the correct pronouns. Anyway, that's not what I am seeking advice about, just a little about me.

As I said, I want to start HRT and though I haven't had much of a real-life experience living as a female since most of my experience has been online and I am an introvert, I have changed my name legally, I am beginning to dress the way I want to although I have always done in a sense, my desired fashion style is often more unisex than anything else, I have also expressed my desire to begin the entire path of transitioning, including HRT, to my GP. I have been referred to a psychosexual service (that I have to travel quite a distance to reach) to, I am assuming, discuss my transsexualism, my desires and I suppose to be 'evaluated' to see if I am infact 'suitable' for transitioning services. However the waiting list for this is some 10 months long and I do not wish to wait that long just for an initial evaluation only to hope that I get the go-ahead to start HRT. 10 months is a long time. Given that I've been anxious to start for about 5 years now, I'm getting tired of waiting and I feel like I'm losing most of my life by waiting around, I feel like I've lost my childhood and teen years to being caged up as someone I'm not. Things need to change and change very soon.

I've been considering going back to my GP and asking if there is a possibility of me beginning prescription HRT without any kind of recommendation letter. I'm not quite sure how it works. I'm at the point where I will look into self-administerd options if I do indeed have to wait 10 months and most likely longer before I will get any kind of help from my medical community.

My question is, does anyone have any advice or personal experiences that can relate to my story and predicament and perhaps help me out? Has anyone from the UK gone through a similar experience and was it possible to get prescription HRT without going through therapy first? Any and all comments would be very welcome.

I'm feeling a bit steamrolled by stereotypes lately. Both from cis and trans folks. Help me branch out if you can.

I'm male, trans, early 40's. Made two serious attempts to transition but eventually proved not to be the best solution. Still, I clean up well: http://i.imgur.com/8CKZpoH.jpg

Gender-wise, I'm cool with mixing it up in subtle ways. No pink sneakers, no dangly gold earrings, no long acrylic nails, nothing obviously female (unless I'm fully dressing the part which isn't often). Ordinarily I'm less visibly different than, say, someone full-on genderqueer. Still, I'm different enough (no beard, no body hair, longish hair, kinda ""pretty"") for people to occasionally give me a second look: ""Is he gay or straight? Or...? I can't tell.""

Having lived as a woman, I'm deeply comfortable with both of my hemispheres (yay!). If I had to score myself, I'm maybe 65% ""man"" 35% ""woman""... though I don't have much in common with the ""average"" crossdresser anymore. I've done my time supporting them in group therapy, seminars, university talks, etc... basically I have the knowledge and (much) of the experience of a full-time transsexual but am not living as such.

I'm in a unique place. I'm happy, but the mountain of self-awareness can be a lonely place at times.

Too many people either...

Have no clue about trans-anything (and don't want to know)...

...or are totally locked into the all-consuming process of building a new identity and transitioning and/or actively repressing/heavily working the internet...

...OR are simply ""done"" with the process of transition and want no further reminders of same.

To be more specific, I get read as a 12 year old male pretty consistently, and even when I presented female I got read as being much younger than I am. My body didn't puberty much: i have small breasts relative to my weight, and I have a more square chest and shoulders than most women, so it actually kind of looks like I have a male-ish chest that just happens to have boobs attached. I have a fairly androgynous build in general, and a lot of the time I feel like I never went through puberty in the first place.

This is beginning to frustrate me deeply. In fact, its becoming my biggets source of dysphoria: I look in the mirror, and I see a child when I should at least *resemble* an adult by now. I'm not even sure if I want top surgery anymore, because when I press down on my chest I just see a child in the mirror, and when I do that I'm looking for a young man.

At the same time, lately I've been rubbing the little hairs on my face, imagining what it would be like to have stubble.

The question of taking T has been in the back of my mind for some time now. I can get access to a gender therapist, and plan to to talk through what's going on.

78,2013-10-26 11:26:14,1p91qx,5,5,"So I (think I) am a cis male, and lately I've been keeping myself up at night wondering about gender identity. If anything, I'm probably slightly gender queer since I don't think I really want to be a woman and I don't have any dysphoria, but being 100% a man 100% of the time doesn't feel *quite* right.

The problem is, I also have health anxiety. I'm used to keeping myself up at night convincing myself that the slight posture related aches and pains in the left side of my chest are definitely a sign of imminent heart failure. I'm used to keeping myself up at night convincing myself the pressure headaches I started getting after moving to a new climate are definitely because I have a brain tumor.

Now, to be clear, I don't think being trans* or genderqueer is a health defect, but this process of keeping myself up at night thinking about it definitely feels a lot like my health anxiety. 

I stay up at night telling myself ""You feel like cis male is pretty close to correct but not quite a perfect label? It must be because you're a transwoman and now you have to get hormones and SRS and you have to come out and you have to deal with so much transphobia for the rest of your life including your own semi-conscious transphobia because you know it's there and all of this is going to be compounded by your anxiety and it's going *to suck.* Let's deal with this by reading about all the complications that sometimes happen in all of the various types of sexual reassignment surgeries because that worked really well when we were reading articles on WebMD about how headaches are definitely a sign of brain tumors.""

What's most frustrating about this is that I'm spending all my time wrestling with gender and because of my hang ups I feel like I'm spending all of my time in a debate that I can't advance in any direction. I convince myself I'm cis and then say 'but that's probably just your unconscious transphobia combined with a fear of the process of transitioning combined with trying in vain to talk your way out of your own anxiety,' so I bounce back to 'I'm definitely trans*' and then I remind myself 'this feels so much like 'I definitely have a heart problem' or 'this headache is definitely a sign of something serious.'

Basically, I don't trust myself to come to any possible conclusion about the questions I have, so I'm stuck in this debate which is making me anxious and costing me sleep.

I'm a 22 MTF individual who is in the final year of college. I'm out to my family only but plan to be publicly out by the time I graduate in November 2014. I'm quite happy with how the whole process has gone so far and I'll be much happier when I can finally be completely honest about the real me with everyone.

While coming out has been a mainly positive experience so far, I do find myself now just wanting to get some part of the transition process underway. My day to day thoughts have drifted further and further away from my college work and more towards starting to transition in a years time. This has obviously led to me being quite frustrated and disconnected from everything else in my life. It feels as if everything else is just sort of happening around me and I'm just playing my part. Honestly, if I could drop out tomorrow and start transitioning, I would! However, it's my final year and I really want to graduate without any major issues.

Shame for wanting to be cute and maybe even asexual. I hate being a man. I\'m scared to be a woman. I want to cry, but it doesn\'t work anymore. The hole is too deep. All the baby animals I wanted to cuddle with, and the cartoon violence that once devastated me, all buried beneath rust and filthy lies. My body is wrong. I only want to feel the softness again. fleeting echoes come and go, suddenly flushed out by past insecurities I thought I was over with. I can\'t even relate to sex right now, at this moment. I can\'t relate to my body... I\'m scared to lose the people who think they know me, and I\'m scared to keep them believing the lies I was forced to believe. I want to shed gender entirely, maybe even sexuality (at least at this moment). I want to cry.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Can I be really honest?', 'created': 1383060531.0}"
