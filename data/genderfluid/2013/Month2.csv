-My single very earliest memory is crossdressing with my sisters' dance costumes and loving it.

-Starting at age 5 I inexplicably wanted to transform into a girl and I would daydream about it all of the time

-The thoughts subsided during my elementary school years and I had a normal male childhood, but it came back full force at puberty

-The thoughts turned sexual in nature

-Began cross dressing

-To cope with my desire to transform into a girl, I compartmentalized my transgender feelings into sexual fantasies.

-I've never been able to sexually fantasize about being a man in a relationship with a woman, I've always had to be the woman. This led to immense frustrating trying to ""make the pieces fit,"" trying to force myself into the male role in heterosexual fantasies.

-I realized I had a huge problem at 18 and began therapy

-Psychiatrist has had me on every anti-depressant/anxiety in the book. Right now I'm on 4 (celexa, welbutrin, fanapt, and xanax)

-I've been to seven therapists. The gender therapist I saw for only 5 visits because I ran out of money, he seemed to think I was transgender.

-Depressed out of my mind. Not looking forward to anything in life, no hopes or dreams. Having panic attacks every night.

-At 20 I tried an HRT trial, but I got scared and was uncertain, so I quit after 20 days.

-Now at 21, the feelings feel unbearable being in a male body but having the desires to have a female body.

-Not trying to be crude, but to cope with my feelings, I have to sexually fantasize about being a woman multiple times a day just to get any relief.

-Binge eating to cope with my feelings, currently overweight

-I feel hopeless because these feelings are for life, there's no cure.

-Feels like I'm heading towards mental illness if I can't get my depression and anxiety and mental anguish under control.

-I'm considering trying another HRT trial, but I'm not sure how things will be different this time. I'm not sure how I would know if it was right for me. When I would know in my heart that it was for me.

I wore sports bras that were too small to flatten my chest. I developed an eating disorder with the hopes my hips and breasts would stop growing. When I got my period at 13, I went into a suicidal depression for several weeks. 

By the time I started high school, I was 98 pounds. My hips and breasts kept growing. I could no longer fit into my tiny size zero jeans. I was absolutely disgusted with myself. I gained over 20 pounds within a few months due to being underweight and going through puberty despite running track every day and barely eating.

The thought of what my body was turning into made me want to throw up. Instead of the genderless, carefree kid I used to be, I was now turning into something that made me very obviously female, and these changes were only good for one thing: making babies (yuck!). I made my decision to never have my own kids well before I hit puberty. The thought of myself being pregnant and childbirth in general makes me want to vomit. 

I am 24 years old, but the realization that I did not have to identify with a specific gender did not come until a couple years ago. I had been dieting and exercising compulsively for nearly a decade because I thought I wanted to be thin (because I thought that's what would make me attractive), and then I realized recently that I had been doing it (subconsciously) with the false hopes of shrinking the fat in my hips and breasts so I would come off as more androgynous. 

Within the last year or so, I've worn sports bras 90% of the time. I go through girl phases and boy phases, but I also have phases when I want to be both, and when I want to be neither. Sometimes I have drag queen days where I dress over-the-top and feminine. Most people don't see me as a drag queen since I'm already a female, but that's how I feel on the inside so I don't really care what people think. There is no determination for what type of day I will have when I wake up or how long it will last.

Since I have some serious body dysmorphia, I have ""fat"" days and ""skinny"" days (those who have had eating disorders will probably understand that better). For a while, I had been wondering if my ""fat"" days corresponded with my masculine days and my ""skinny"" days corresponded with my feminine days since I felt more comfortable wearing tight fitting clothes on my skinny days. 

Recently I've realized that though they might be very loosely related, more than I thought. Yesterday was a ""skinny"" day. It also happened to be a somewhat masculine day. I wore skinny jeans, my boyfriend's t-shirt, sneakers, and a bandanna to hold my hair back (it's slightly shorter than shoulder length). I felt like a sexy, genderbending punk rocker and it felt so good. It was a good day.

I'm still going through a lot of self discovery and dealing with my eating issues every day. I have learned a lot about myself. Sometimes my body dysmorphia affects my gender presentation and sometimes it doesn't. 

I don't think I'll ever be truly happy with my body because it's still too curvy (meaning size of breasts and hips) for my liking even on my most feminine days. I really like being female, but I still think my breasts and hips should be smaller. Sometimes I feel like my body is a parody of a woman... the size of my breasts and hips in relation to my stature is almost comical, a gross exaggeration meant to be paraded around like a sexual object at some kind of sexual freak show. I hate it so much. I'm a human being and I hate the fact that my body is so connected to femininity when my brain just wants to do it's own thing.

I am desperately trying to find a good community for me. I've been reading for a while here and this seems like such a welcoming and safe place.

I'm a FAAB andro, out as queer within the last year. I live in a VERY conservative area and presenting in a way that's comfortable to me has been scary. I have always been on the ""tomboy"" end of the scale, but I have recently started binding and wearing more masculine clothing. I have two kids and going out in public to do fun things with them has been met with some awkward stares, moreso than when I'm alone. I worry about my kids in school, since I absolutely fall outside of the typical ""mom"" model, and a lot of the kids here have stay-at-home moms who are like The Ultimate Stereotypical Woman. Being queer here isn't easy, but neither is having a gay parent.

I feel like I'm finally getting comfortable with my gender identity and my presentation, although I do wish that I could figure out binding better. I have really small boobs, so pretty much all sports bras are either too tight in the elastic or too loose in the support. I do often wish I had broader/more muscular shoulders and god, I have wanted facial hair since as long as I can remember.

I'm a twentysomething cisman who likes MAABs who express on the feminine-ish side of the spectrum. In transgender reddits and forums, people like me are criticized as fetishists and 'tranny chasers' and very real threats to the physical and emotional well-being of transwomen, and told to keep our harmful fantasies to ourselves. I know the hostility is intended to protect, but boy oh boy, does it ever make me feel like a dirty perv, resigned to lifelong loneliness, and that my attractions are unnatural consequences of internet porn. 

.

On the other hand, of course I don't want to hurt anyone: the reasoning (as I understand it) is  that many/most transwomen hate being pursued for their trans status because they identify absolutely as women. They have bravely fought terrible battles for the right to use the label of female. And a man pursuing them because, so says the man, they *aren't* quite female, but something else, tarnishes that hard-won status.

I'm curious if the feeling is different in a space like this. **My question:** for feminine-expressing MAABs, or really, anyone here, what has your experience been with dating people who are attracted to your being genderqueer? Is it validating? Is it frustrating if their ideal partner and your ideal expression don't quite match, and they try to change you? I'm interested in anything you have to say.

 The triggers for dysphoria tend to be things that explicitly remind me that being read as female sets me apart from men, even when the intention is meant well (e.g. Guys holding the door for me/offering to carry things for me/etc. because it's 'chivalrous' to do those things for a woman), or when I'm in a group of girls who are talking about things typically considered to be feminine, or just generally any situation that enforces the binary (e.g. clothes shopping).

16,2013-02-10 08:17:31,188mvz,8,3,"UPDATE: 

Results happened. 

I came out to my girlfriend sometime mid-October. 
I had been withdrawing from her, (a result of desperately trying to come up with a ""safe"" (lolz) way of telling her all of this... stuff) and she had started to suspect there might be another girl in my life. 

Only when she threatened to go stay in a hotel for a spell did I realise I had been well and truly backed into the corner I had hoped/expected I eventually would.

I sat her down (with berry cream cheese frosted cupcakes) and ... said it. ""I'm transgendered. I'm a woman.."" and the rest. I took it slow, i think. She listened, nodded, looking at me stonefaced.

It dawned on her slowly that I wasnt joking, and at that point it hit her like a ton of bricks. 
She disappeared to the bathroom, and after a few minutes I realised I should probably go check on her. 
And.. at this point I realised just how close I was to losing her. She was disgusted, infuriated, heartbroken. I think she actually said ""you broke my heart"". (A lot of this day is a blur. I'm okay with that, this isnt a day I want to remember really).

As the day went on, jokes were made, more tears were shed. There was vomiting (stress related, not the cupcakes), she went to the bedroom, asked me not to follow her. I passed out on the couch (and felt terrible for it, ""how does one have a nap at a time like this?!"" i thought, but... a stressful few weeks will do that) and by the evening we were cuddling on the couch. 

Since then, almost every day has been a struggle in its own right. 
Sometimes the struggle is all hers, battling with her dreams of our future, the possibility of what it might be now, whether she should just cut and run and try again with a man, or whether she can learn to be attracted to a woman... who used to be her Man. 

Sometimes the struggle is mine. The desire to start transitioning, the frustration in waiting (though I've never been asked to, I want to take it slow for the people around me.) the same fantasy of cutting and running, all pretty and glowy with the idea of being independant, single, with only myself to blame and disappoint and make proud, though I know this isnt what I want. 
I truly believe we have something special, the kind of thing the people around me moan about never being able to find, and I believe we're strong enough to make it work.

What We've Been Doing:

During a therapy session (We've had 3 haphazard sessions so far, when things have gotten bad) girlfriend mentioned how none of this seems real, and she finds herself believing that all of this trans-BS has gone away. 
Then, when she's reminded of the reality of it, it crushes her, worse and worse each time. 

My therapist suggested we simply role-play. Dress up in the clothes I have, do some makeup, watch tv in girlmode together. 

This has helped a lot, actually. Much more than I expected. 

First was just clothes, and it was awkward. (Made worse by EP102 of Orange is the New Black, Laverne Cox's first real appearance), but... we survived it. 

Second time was different. Same thing, she made dinner, I showered and shaved my face to within an inch of its life, and put on a cute tunic and leggings. We just existed, not thinking, not asking, not talking about ""it/us/future"". 

Third time was wild. GF suggested doing my makeup, and we actually had fun with it. She told me I looked pretty, my heart skipped a beat. My mind was filled with a hope I hadnt felt in... at least a year. Thoughts of two wedding dresses danced across my mind as I fell asleep that night.

And this is where we are now. Still together, struggling, but fighitng the fight. 

TL:DR: Came out to girlfriend, still together.

Hi reddit. 

Long time lurker, recent contributor. 
As is customary of this subreddit, I'm sure. 

Short: 
how do I come out to my girlfriend of four years that I'm trans?

Long:
We've been together for four years, friends online for twice that. 
She came across the ocean to South Africa four years ago, and has lived with me since. We've travelled back and forth from SA to USA, and have a very strong bond. 

[before I go any further, since GF reddits far more than I do: 
Girlfriend, Id you read this, I'm sorry, and I love you more than anything. ]

She lives and works with me and my parents at our family run business, and we have plans on moving out eventually. (Well, ASAP, really. She wants to get started on creating a Life together)

I feel like my hands are tied. We're usually together 99% of the day, so going the therapist route (getting a letter, etc) seems out of the question. 
Unfortunately it's the route I would rather take, since SO is a serious sceptic, and I'm dreading her asking the question ""are you sure?"".
(Just to be clear, I'm not really questioning anymore, but can anyone be 100% sure in this situation? There's always that sliver of self doubt. With me anyway)

I'm sorry if this comes across as haphazard, its 3am. I'm on a roof taking photos of lightning, I'm coming down with the flu, but worst of all... I'm just really sad. 

Sad at the idea of losing her. She's one of the most important things in my life, if not THE most important. 
She's taught me more about myself and the world than I could ever have imagined. 
I'm terrified of breaking her heart. 
I'm terrified of the moment after telling her how I feel. What happens, the silence. The tears. Will she stay out of stubbornness or obligation? Will she leave? She doesn't have enough cash to get a ticket home. I'm afraid, straight up. 

Would I rather keep this inside, and pretend it'll go away eventually?

This (Removed) and this (http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/j4kqx/i_now_know_i_will_probably_never_be_able_to_come/) say no. We all know it won't. We all know the best time to do it is now.

Please help, reddit. I feel like I'm nearing a breaking point. I told myself I'd make 2013 the year of change. The starting point on a long and belated journey. 

If I've left things out, or you want more info on something, please say. I just need some pro tips on how to start the sentence.

I can never really decide what clothes I feel comfortable in as I seem awkward in both men's and women's styles and have always leaned towards neutral hoodie/jeans combos because of this.

I am trying to get 1,000 people to complete a survey I've designed.

https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/perfectlynormal

I already have several hundred but I'm not happy with the sample's diversity. Right now almost everyone is cis-gendered and 86% identify as straight. I'd love to get a lot of trans-gender, gender non-conforming voices in the mix. (You might notice the queer-dog-whistle of the colors I chose for the survey).

This survey is part of a larger project I am doing which is investigating some cultural reasons why so many of us are trying hard to create the life we want, yet we still don't feel great about ourselves or parts of our lives.

I would be so very grateful if you would maybe take this TOTALLY ANONYMOUS survey and then pass it along to others. It takes less than 10 minutes. Did I mention it's ANONYMOUS? Did I mention I would love more gender diversity?

I am not making any money off of this project. I am doing it on my own time outside of work (I was trained to do research). Also, I created this account specifically to get the word about about this survey. So no karma whoring here. Maybe upvote for visibility?

Thanks so much if you are able to help!

42,2013-02-15 00:18:40,18jto0,6,15,"Okay um. Hi. I guess I should finally introduce myself. I've been lurking here for months and have been wanting to tell my story for a while. ~~I'll try not to make this too long.~~ Edit: oops.

I'm a biological male in my early 30s. I was crossdressing as early as the age of 7, and I ran the painfully awkward gauntlet of puberty and adolescence that I'm sure is very familiar to most of you, where our bodies are changing rapidly, our hormones are firing like mad, and we're questioning who the hell we are from all different angles without knowing any solid answers. I stole clothes from my mom and hid them in my room, which made for some cringeworthy moments when she found them. I ordered panties online and my brother intercepted the mail. I embarrassed the hell out of myself and hated what I was doing, but I couldn't stop.

At first, as I grew into adulthood, I just shoved everything right into the same box as my sexual kinks (literally and figuratively). Having grown up in a very sheltered Midwest small town, my atmosphere didn't allow for much exploration in terms of figuring oneself out. I was just used to the attitude that if you fall anywhere outside of any black-and-white cisgender role, you're ostracized as a weirdo. It took a while after living in the city for things to gradually demystify and I realized this wasn't just some sexual thing. Well, to some extent it was (corsets are hot :P), but to a much larger extent, I see it as simply a healthy expression of my identity and who I am inside. This wonderful, genderbendery, very grey area, girl/boy/person inside.

My life has been a whirlwind of living all over the country, so I'll try not to digress too much... but when I was 25, after I had suffered a bad breakup in Austin, I ran away to Portland. I'm still confused about why I did that. It was a blitz decision in an emotional blur. But one thing sticks out in my memory about that move: I wanted to start over. I was still very, very confused about myself, I was questioning whether I was transgender, and I wanted to move to a brand new city where I had no bad personal associations and where I knew nobody. Open slate, man. I rented a room in the house of a film producer. I increased my meager stash of women's clothing by about twentyfold, and for the first time I was going out in public as a girl. I met a few random people online this way. Then I realized the fun in combining the girl stuff and guy stuff. Flannel shirt + skirt + boots. Pretty cardigan + ratty guy jeans + bright Converse. You get it. In retrospect, I've always been genderqueer, and the habits were totally reflecting that. I have never liked the ""crossdresser"" stigma, nor did I ever truly believe I was transgendered. I'm still not into labels, but I like genderqueer. It's not so much a label as it is a term to describe a liberating realization.

Anyway... my time in Portland didn't last, and a series of new events landed me in Chicago. When I was 28 I went through the biggest, self-loathing shitbag of an identity crisis of my life, and I just... fucking purged everything. Didn't even donate it, I just threw it out. I'm leaving out a **lot** of details here for the sake of the fluidity of this story, so forgive me... but after a domino effect of shitty circumstances that happened to me, I just wanted to be a tough guy. I now know this was a stupid front. I got rid of all my dresses, all my girl stuff, anything that was even *remotely* girly, and my wardrobe since then has been very monotone, guyish, and I hate to say, boring.

I'm tired of typing and I feel I've given enough backstory, so let's skip ahead: **I fucking miss everything. about. this.** I'm 32 now, and I'm tired of putting up fronts, tired of hiding. This is the part where I am going to tell you the snafu of where I am right now. I am currently broke, living with family after some drug addictions ran my life into the ground (15 months clean... yay), and I am back in that same stupid fucking backwards-ass Midwest town that I hated and wanted to leave so badly as a teenager. It is beyond humbling.

I spent the entirety of 2012 depressed, in social isolation and feeling sorry for myself. Recovery has been a bitch in that regard. But somehow in the last two months I have entered this inexplicable, disciplined mental shift. I don't know where it's been coming from. Other than a few exceptions I haven't been depressed. I'm not questioning it too much because I don't want to ruin it. But it has thrown me this side effect: I want to get the hell out. I want to run away again. I don't know where I want to go. *I want to be me again.* 

What's stopping me? Money. In the past, I always had money to run away when I wanted to run away. Now that I'm broke it's a little bit harder. I'm actually currently moving that process forward right now, but it's probably going to take a few months before I build anything up that's significant. In the meantime I have to be patient. I'm frustrated, but at the same time, I am excited for whatever future lies ahead of me.

Funny... this post began as something else entirely, but once I started typing my story I realized how much I needed to say all of this, so I switched the title and focus of the post.

Eh, I'm bad with ending anything I write, so I'll do it abruptly. Thanks for reading. I consider everybody here my buddies, even if y'all are strangers.

People compliment it a lot at this length, and I kinda like it, but idk. I'm really thinking about a change, especially if it keeps my hair out of my eyes. (I wear hats half the time for this reason so why do I bother with this length in that case? Maybe a little bit longer would be easier to keep out of my eyes when it's down, maybe not.) They also compliment the color a lot. It's medium brown I guess? In light it looks a lot lighter and kinda fabulous.

I'm really considering a new cut though. Or at least new ways of styling it with gel or whatever. I don't normally use gel because my girlfriend hates it and I only do two or three different styles with it which are very simple and don't seem worth it for having sticky gel in your hair all day.

**TL;DR:**

Very thick, brown longish hair needs new ideas/suggestions for cuts and/or styling

I don't know what look I'm going for anymore. If it's attractive I'm willing to consider your suggestion. I like messy, professional looking, (combinations thereof,) and I really like punk-ish styles if anyone has any ideas there. I've wanted to do a weird androgynous-ish cut with blue-dyed hair for a while. But even hearing that it's good as it is would be great. My gf says it is and I only want to cut it/dye it if I think it'll look better.

It's already somewhat feminine imo but I wouldn't mind presenting even more so if it looks good. Not trying to present as anything in particular, so lay any ideas on me you think would look good. I find the mohawk-with-sideburns things I see a lot here kinda overdone (just my personal aesthetic opinion, dont get upset! :D) but something along those lines would be fine.

I used to be pretty depressed, and a lot of the feelings were because I wish I had born as a girl. The thing that really burned me the hardest is the fact that it wasn't until age 18 that I began to feel like that, a lot, and by that point I felt as if it was too late. I did research on transgenderism and transsexuality, and read stories about people starting hormone therapy and lifestyle changes as kids or as teens. It really made me feel as if I had waited too late, because physically I had developed into a male and I feel as if there is no going back, and doubt I can pass. 

Being 24 now I just can't fathom the lifestyle change of transitioning. I only came out of depression recently and still can't get over the fact that I've missed out on a lot of my life because of that, and feel as I need to grab what I can (which is life as a male) and just go for it. I only have one shot at my 20s and I think transitioning now would be more than I could ever take on.

Or, that the time for you to go trans has passed and it's too late in your life to do such. \n\nI used to be pretty depressed, and a lot of the feelings were because I wish I had born as a girl. The thing that really burned me the hardest is the fact that it wasn't until age 18 that I began to feel like that, a lot, and by that point I felt as if it was too late. I did research on transgenderism and transsexuality, and read stories about people starting hormone therapy and lifestyle changes as kids or as teens. It really made me feel as if I had waited too late, because physically I had developed into a male and I feel as if there is no going back, and doubt I can pass. \n\nBeing 24 now I just can't fathom the lifestyle change of transitioning. I only came out of depression recently and still can't get over the fact that I've missed out on a lot of my life because of that, and feel as I need to grab what I can (which is life as a male) and just go for it.

89,2013-02-28 15:59:51,19efow,6,9,"First off, let me say that, while I have spoken to some of my gender queer friends about it at a very high level, I'm really shaking on the specifics. I don't mean to offend anyone with this post, and I'm sorry if I use incorrect language to ask these questions.

Background on the lawsuit: There was a 6 year old girl who wanted to use the women's restroom at school. However, the school district wouldn't let her, because she had been born a male. The school district did offer to let her use the unisex bathroom or the nurse's bathroom, instead of the men's, but they wouldn't let her use the women's.

Questions:
1) What exactly is someone who is gender queer? I'm guessing that it goes beyond being ""tomboy"" or ""girly"". However, I don't understand the mentality.

2) Is gender queer coupled with homosexuality? For example, if you have someone who identifies male, does that mean that they will like females? What's the correct way to reference this attraction (homosexual versus heterosexual).

3) Is it possible for someone so young to be gender queer? I've heard (and this may be completely wrong) that homosexuality tends to come to light, once a person gets to be of an age where they acknowledge attraction. I know I thought about boys when I was in 1st grade, so is this just a problem of an adult (me) saying that the girl is too young to process her gender?

4) From the school district's side, what do you think would be a good course of action? At this age, did they offer the best solution that they could?
