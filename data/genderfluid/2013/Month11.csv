15,2013-11-04 16:39:24,1pvsn7,14,7,"Hi all, I'm struggling a little bit and wondering if anyone has some advice? (sorry if long)

I am MAAB but I transitioned to female because I felt very feminine and struggled to pass as male/an adult. But... as I learned more about gender identity and stuff, I know that I'm not really woman-identified for any number of reasons, just definitely femme-identified, and lately I am really struggling with it. I don't think a binary identity is for me, but I noticed that most GQ people are GQ while living legally as their birth sex--sorry if that is incorrect.

Unfortunately, I'm not as subconsciously comfortable in my female presentation as I think a FAAB person would be (because I didn't grow up as female) that I can start presenting more GQ without feeling very at risk emotionally--I do suffer with pretty bad anxiety, BDD and BPD. To most people in my life right now I am female and while I pass as that with no problems, my self-esteem and body image are not very good so I have never gone beyond that presentation, and since I prefer femme presentation it hasn't really mattered.

I want to accept my more GQ or at times genderfluid identity, I want to stop claiming ""woman"" when I don't feel that it describes me, but I don't know where to start. Legally I am sort of in-between, I have a female name and my sex on papers is male.

I have considered total detransition to live as a femme GQ boy, and physically it would probably still be possible with top surgery, I just think my mental health is not good enough to survive that change and life immediately thereafter because while I have the chromosomes to get a little extra feeling of validity, I have never really lived as an adult male or had male friends, and I don't think I could pass as male right now... maybe never with a femme presentation.

So, anyway :o) where is a good middleground/first steps? I would like to maybe get involved in LGBT spaces--are they typically accepting of GQ and non-binary identities? Or are there any other spaces where I could feel very safe and comfortable presenting as GQ or male while looking female?

Thank you so much for reading!!!

31,2013-11-08 23:13:43,1q7ln9,12,5,"I initially wrote this post for another forum and am copy pasting it here since this subreddit is probably in one of the best positions to help me figure out myself.  For some background, I decided to transition (MtF) around 30 months ago and have been on hrt for almost 24 months.  



A couple hours ago, I read an interview with someone who identifies as genderqueer and who described transition as a body mod. It completely caught my attention and since then, I've thought more intensely about gender than I have for years. Within six months of going full time, I knew my journey with gender wasn't over. At some point, I was going to play with the idea of going back towards gender neutral or gender fluid, buying a binder and potentially retraining my male voice. For over a year, I've known this was an itch I would have to scratch and which I would when the time was right. I just never expected it to hit me this suddenly. I'm not even sure it's time yet, but it certainly is much closer than it was last night. 

I've been trying to sort through my feelings related to transition as a body mod. I've always known my transition was very different from other's who knew they absolutely had to transition. I've told people I probably could have spent another few decades living as male and I would have lived a fine life (even if not as fulfilled as the one I'm living now). My ex asked me if I would have transitioned if I was able to find confidence while male bodied and I told her probably not. My journey to transition was asking myself at many points ""would life be better in a female body?"" and weighing the costs and benefits. After months of this, the answer always never came out worse than even and usually having a female body came out ahead. As a result, I decided to transition. The end result of this was that the social privilege I would gain as a girl weighed heavily into my decision to transition.

The interview mentioned how they were incredibly similar to how they were pre transition and they put a huge emphasis on socialization for behavior. As more time passes, I find this to be more and more true for myself. Being socialized as a male definitely has affected my behavior and since I have no desire to change it, I have to question how much hormones actually did for me. Were my increased emotions the result of hormones or the result of allowing myself to express what I already felt more openly? Certainly the hormones played some part, but did they play any large part beyond just being a simple body mod?

I don't expect to reach any answers in the near future and I fully expect these thoughts to consume my idle cycles for this weekend and probably longer. I'm honestly not sure where I will end up with gender, but I do expect to stay on e and keep the body I have now. How I decorate it might change, but the physical form of my body is amazing as it is. Feeling this makes me very happy with my decision a few weeks ago to not increase my spiro dosage in an attempt to get larger breasts. My AA-A cup breasts will play beautifully into any form of androgyny I try and adopt :)

I'm not sure how coherent any of this was, especially towards the end, but putting my thoughts into words has definitely calmed my mind down enough to let me be productive at work. It will be interesting to see where the ideas put into my mind today take me.



I should probably also say I know transition is much more than this for many people and I don't want to offend anyone with this. I'm just trying to figure out what it means for myself and what the implications of that are. If transition was something absolutely necessary for my survival and without a doubt I identified as female 100% of the time, there would be no need for me to have these thoughts. I'm not sure where this is going, but I just wanted to say my situation is probably uncommon within the trans* community and I'm definitely not trying to suggest the idea of transitioning being a body mod is applicable to everyone.",genderqueer,What is transition?,1383977623.0,"{'created_utc': 1383952423, 'id': '1q7ln9', 'num_comments': 12, 'score': 5, 'selftext': 'I initially wrote this post for another forum and am copy pasting it here since this subreddit is probably in one of the best positions to help me figure out myself.

Background: I'm cisgender female in a same-sex relationship. In fact, I'm engaged to get married. My partner is a pure lesbian without any desire to be with a man, even a transman.

For the past several nights, I've been having weird dreams. First, I dreamed that I was begging strangers to have sex with me (heterosexual sex, w/ me as a receiving woman). Second night, I dreamed that I was pregnant. Last night, I dreamed that I am transgender FTM... the dream was complicated... I wanted to come out, but the environment I was in wouldn't allow me unless they humiliated me first. As part of the humiliation, I had to denounce my trans identity. I remember screaming ""nooooooooo"" when the moment came to denounce it - because I knew I would be harming myself and denying my truth if I said that I wasn't trans. In the next scene, I yelled at my close friends when they came back from a date (they're a lesbian couple), because they wanted me to stay longer babysitting their kids. I didn't want to stay longer because it would have kept me from keeping an appointment to benefit the transition process. Then, I began screaming my masculine name repetitively and tried to get away from everyone preventing me from transitioning.

I feel most comfortable presenting myself in a very androgynous way, though sometimes I like to mix it up and tend more towards the male or female end of the spectrum, depending on the day.  I get read as female probably about 70% of the time, as my voice is a little on the high side and my body and face shape are somewhat feminine.  Since discovering the informed consent model (rather than needing a GID diagnosis and a referral) I've been considering T as a way to masculinze certain features and place myself more in the middle of the spectrum.  However, I am feeling somewhat ambivalent about some of the changes, both physical and psychological, that accompany HRT, and how they might affect me and the people around me.  

* I'd really like to be able to have a lower pitched voice.  I may be able to accomplish this with vocal training, but I also don't want to feel like I'm constantly straining to pitch my voice lower than its natural range.
* I like my body more or less the way it is, but I think I'd be ok with the fat redistribution that tends to come with taking T.  I can generally make my body look like the shape I want by how I dress, so the effects T would have on my physique are not necessarily a priority for me.
* My face, on the other hand, is something I'd like to work on.  It's has a very round shape, and so I often get read either as female, or as a very young boy.  I'm hoping that T would have a masculinizing effect on my face, thought I recognize that it won't change the bone structure.
* I would really love to be able to grow facial hair, partly to cover up my baby face, but also just because I really like the idea of having a beard.  However, I'm also a little nervous about it because I don't know if it's something I would want all the time.  Plus, my partner really doesn't like facial hair at all.  She's fine with the idea of all the other possible physical changes, but she's expressed serious reservations about me growing a beard.
* The thing I'm probably the most nervous about is the way T would affect my temperament and character traits, as I understand that this is highly unpredictable and varies greatly depending on the person.  

I'm looking for any kind of input from people with experience with hormone treatment.  What are some other important effects of T that I should be prepared for?

When I was quite young, I, on occasion, would refer to ""When I was a girl"" and then go on describing a fantasy. I was fascinated with all things feminine, despite, or perhaps because of, the fact that I had no sisters or other female acquaintances. Pink was my favorite color, The Powerpuff Girls was nominally my favourite show, and I acquired a large collection of My Little Pony toys (and this was long before there was such a thing as a brony). I still thought of myself as a boy, but always as a different kind of boy from my brothers and cousins. I was ok being a boy as long as I could be a princess at the same time. My mother and grandmother, who both wanted a girl, were especially open to letting me live this way. I even remember my grandmother getting me a fairy-princess outfit.

By the time I was six or seven, I sensed that I was not meant to live this way. Most likely, entering school helped me become aware of this. My mother encouraged me to give away my ""girl's toys"", which I did after a good amount of taunting from my older brother. I soon decided that my new favourite color green, the same as my brother, and that I was firmly a boy.

As I entered the later part of my pre-teen childhood, and my identity as a boy was quite strong. I did grow my hair long, leading to many taking me for a girl. At this point, I always corrected them, sometimes even getting angry. I was still decidedly un-masculine, having no interest in sports and often being closer to the girls than was expected at my age. Admittedly, in many cases I had little control over this; for instance, I, by chance, was the only male in my grade's gifted program. However, other times it seemed I was very much in control. I was the only male who volunteered to skip recesses to help younger kids make bead-bracelets. Similarly, on the coldest days of the year, during outdoor recess, it was myself and a group of girls who huddled against the wall together to stay warm. Allegedly, some of them thought that I was a girl myself because of my hair. I became aware of the word ""tomboy"" and, although I never used it to describe myself in speaking, I began to think of myself as very much like one.

As I entered my tween and early teen years, people, for the most part, stopped telling me that my long hair made me look like a girl. I became aware of the terms ""gay"" and ""straight"" and immediately decided that I was straight; I was indeed developing attraction towards girls. My identity as a boy seemed quite solid. However, gender as an idea began to fascinate me. I spent a long time on the internet looking at quizzes like this one http://quizilla.teennick.com/quizzes/1096133/. I always got excited when I got the girl answer. Stories involving cross-dressing were always appealing to me, although at the time I had no desire to cross-dress myself. As an early teen, I began masturbating almost every day, having sexual fantasies of my penis falling off and me turning into a girl.

It was when I was fourteen that I began to seriously question who I was. It began when I discovered that I was bisexual. Simultaneously, I began ending up with a fascination for cross-dressing, this time without any erotic background. I was then terrified, and still am, of the idea of being discovered. In the now rare times that I was called ""Ma'am"", I now wanted to hug the people making the ""mistake"". In fact, when my bullies mocked me by asking ""do you ever get your period on the bus?"" and calling me ""fag"", it actually makes me feel better, as at least it feels as if people focus on that aspect of me.

And that's essentially were I am now. I'm bisexual, although I have never been in a relationship with either gender (I have some bad social anxiety which prevents me from getting especially close to anyone). To everyone else, including my family, I'm just a guy. I haven't even come out as bi yet. The phrase ""I am a guy"" doesn't seem as much inaccurate to me as it seems simply depressing. I'm certainly not happy with my masculine appearance, but then again, I'm still terrified to try and change it. last year, I decided to shave my legs, but only did above the knees because I was afraid of anyone finding out. I'm still trying to gather the courage to shave the whole thing. I generally feel an overall sense of powerlessness; I always imagine that if I endure a few more year of being a guy, then I can get away from my family and everything I know so that I can decide for myself who I am. If I say that I'm anything but a guy right now, I feel like I'm lying, but if I say that I'm a guy, I just feel upset.

67,2013-11-20 01:15:30,1r0vdh,27,10,"Hi everyone,

I don't post much in here, but I lurk often.  I am a mid-twenties person who identifies as genderqueer/fluid.  I have always known the gender binary didn't fit me, but I didn't have the language to describe it until the last 2 years.

Until that time, I identified as a hetero woman, and I thought I was only attracted to cis men.  But that's all changing, and I am finding it really confusing.

Last year, I developed feelings for a trans* man I was working with.  He was incredibly intelligent, sweet-hearted, and seemed to understand the perspectives of men and women, and those outside the binary all at once.  He was complex, and educated.  Most of the young men I meet are military or blue collar, so this guy was a HUGE breath of fresh air.

I'm starting to find a place within my local LBGTQ community.  Last week I was at a two-spirit seminar, and to my great joy, there were other people who openly identified as GQ/GF there!  All of us were AFAB, but the different expressions of where each of us currently sit in the spectrum was really varied.

Moving from the cis/straight world into the LBGTQ one... Wow, the two groups seem to look so different.  Part of that is fashion, but it's largely the way people hold themselves.  Straight women aren't the least bit attractive to me, but I'm realizing that femme-gendered LBGTQ people are.  I usually feel like the ""stand out"" in a room because of the way I dress and act, but in this room I felt very ""normal""... It was a nice feeling.

So if I do not feel cis-gendered, can I still say I'm ""straight""?  I don't really think I can.  I've only had sex and relationships with cis-men, but I find myself increasingly open to imagining a different type of partnership.  My longest relationship was with a bisexual fellow (he leans more towards men than women).  We talked about my gender identity years after, and he said he eventually realized part of his attraction to me is that I have a lot of male energy.  I liked him because he has a lot of female energy.  Unfortunately we don't really like anything else about each other anymore, hahaha.

Thank you for reading, I really just needed an open ear.  If you have any thoughts to share, I'd appreciate it.  I imagine that some of you have had similar confusing periods of change.

I just can't seem to elbow my way between the trans/gay worlds to get ""there""... if ""there"" even exists. 

I once dated an MTF-identified person who refreshingly claimed to be neither man nor woman... but both. Her identity ""was"" trans. As in, not merely moving from point A to point B. Which is also how I feel. ""Full time both"". Not gay, not woman, more like ""half gay, half woman"". 

What does ""half gay, half woman"" look like? Well, I guess like me. I live as a ""pretty"" male now after making two attempts to transition.

I don't know a lot about the trans community, so please forgive &amp; correct me if I get any terminology wrong.

I work at a day-care centre, and one of the children I care for has a very interesting relationship with his/her gender. Biologically, the child is male. I'll call him Tim.

Tim loves to play with hair, wear princess dresses, and have ribbons tied into his/her hair.

More interestingly though, Tim often goes by other names like 'Daisy' 'Sally' and 'Alice'. I overheard a conversation between him/her and another child yesterday: ""You're pretending to be a girl!"" ""No, I am a girl!""

Later, I asked Daisy, ""Will you be Daisy tomorrow?"" ""No, I'm going to be Sally"" ""Do you think you'll be Tim another day?"" ""I don't want to be Tim ever again""

He/she also expresses a strong desire to have ""beautiful, long hair"".

All of the educators roll with it, and call him/her by the name that he/she chooses each day. When I help him/her to get changed on days that she's a girl, I'll call her underwear 'knickers' or 'undies' instead of 'jocks'.
Sometimes other children will say, 'You're not a girl, you're a boy!' and if I hear them, I'll say 'Daisy is a girl today'. Most of the kids pick up on it and call her Daisy for the rest of the day. 

I guess I want to make sure that I'm handling this properly? And find out as much information as I can about very young children who are transgender, anecdotal or otherwise.

I am a non-binary artist curating a compilation of non-binary written and oral histories. My aim is to document our existence in the world with a collection that reaffirms our varied selves to each other and helps others to understand. I am reaching out to the internet to get in touch with as many people as possible who want to have their voices and stories preserved and shared with the world.

You can write a sentence or a novella. I’m including some prompts below; you can answer all, or some, or none in your response. Responses may be published, but will all be anonymous. I will be publishing responses on this project’s tumblr, as well as an edited (for brevity and obvious spelling mistakes only) e-book and hard-copy version.
I thank y’all so much in advance for your contributions! You can get updates about this project at nonbinaryhistories.tumblr.com (recently created, nothing there as of writing this). We gotta stand for each other, y’all.

I'm currently in a Second language acquisition course, and I'm particularly interesting in the affects of transitioning on second language acquisition. Specifically I want to know what happens pre and post hormonal treatment for transmen and transwomen. Of interest are those that have either learnt a second language and are working on their third post transition or are learning a second during the transition process. But anyone who is trans* identified and has learned a second language and is continuing its use is welcomed. 

What I'll need is around 30 - 60 minutes of time with an interview, either on skype or in-person (if you are in the bay area) about your experiences learning another language. I will need to record the interviews to then transcribe. You will be shown the transcription once I finish and have the ability to edit it. Of course, all interviews will be anonymous and completely voluntary. This can be any language so both native and non-English speakers are fine. Along with learning a ( first or second) signed language. To be a part of this please email me here on reddit.

A quick description: I'm tall and hairy, with rather broad shoulders, a square-ish face, and a pretty deep voice. All around manly man body, though it's extremely rare that I feel 100% male. Most days, I fall between just on the male side of neutral, and just slightly female. I'm not ashamed or disgusted by my body, though I'm sick to death of how I present on the outside not matching how I feel on the inside. People are either intimidated by the big man, or engage me while ignoring my wife, because I put off some bullshit ""alpha"" vibe.

I would love to start wearing, and pull off, clothing that doesn't scream ""man"", though I know I won't feel good if I end up looking like a drag queen. No disrespect there, it's just not the look for me. I've been treated as and presented as nothing but male my entire life, and am completely lost when it comes to how to start exploring this.

Part of my issue is that, with maleness being considered a sort of ""default"", mens' clothing has broad applications and appeal, including a kind of fashion neutral zone, while womens' clothing is largely seen and treated as solely the realm of women. FAAB in a suit? Daring and cool! MAAB in a dress? Bring out the pitchforks and torches. So with that in mind, I'm not really up for wearing frilly skirts and whatnot, but on a body like mine, a lot of ""neutral"" wear would just look like regular old dude's clothes. Basically, I desperately need to reduce the amount of ""macho"" that I project.

Help?

I'm not against experimenting with a little makeup from time to time, and while I'm in my early 30s, I'm still a fan of the punk aesthetic. My workplace is pretty conservative, or at least mildly homophobic, but I'd still be interested in hearing about possible work-friendly attire that'll let me not just relegate my gender expression to the weekend.

If you don't have any fashion advice, even just hearing how you started exploring your own gender would help. Failing THAT, a link to other 30-somethings going through the same things would be AMAZING. It seems really hard to find genderqueer MAABs, just figuring all of this out, who aren't in their teens or twenties. Similar stories would take a huge weight off.

And yes, my wife is super supportive. Psyched even.

TLDR; What clothing or style to make a lumberjack body more in line with neutral/slightly feminine self? Links?

  So I have this close friend, who I'll call Jane. Jane and I have been friends for almost ten years, and were room mates for three years. For all this time, I only ever knew Jane as an enthusiastically heterosexual woman. About a year ago, Jane came out to me as bisexual.

I observed Jane thriving and felt super happy for them. Less than a month after that, Jane came out as genderqueer. This was a surprise, but I was supportive none the less. I have many genderqueer friends, so the concept is not foreign to me.

They are very frustrated with me, and its negatively effecting our friendship to the point that I\'m not sure we are going to make it. I feel like it should be obvious that I\'m trying my best, but they don\'t seem to understand that this is a transition process for me as well. \n\n  How can I approach this without making it seem like this is all about me? I want so badly to be a supportive friend, and I don\'t want to lose this valuable relationship.

I don't know how to feel about this. On one hand, I don't have the whole story. There likely is more to just ""the artist and their baby were pushed out of the relationship and their own home"", but I will not speculate. On the other hand, jaybird likely needs support now and I hope that people can band together to at least send them messages of hope and love.

103,2013-11-30 19:45:20,1rsflm,26,11,"Hello,

I originally posted this in r/lgbt, but I also got a suggestion to post it here. My original post is below. Let me know if you have any advice for me!

I was born with two X chromosomes, but I am genderqueer. I honestly don't seem like the ""typical"" genderqueer person to everyone around me. I look and dress very cis gendered. I understand that can make identification difficult, but it is disheartening when someone (even those in the lgbtqa community) doubts that I am what I have said I am. Personally, that's other people. The problem is I'm not really being supportive of myself. And it's getting in the way of living a healthy life.

I really don't feel uncomfortable with being pegged (for lack of a better term) as female most days. Often times to just passerbys I don't bother to correct them.

That is until I try to take better care of my body. I have excess weight. I'm (proudly as I've made tremendous progress; I was once obese as a kid) sitting on the border between a ""normal"" and ""overweight"" BMI. I am almost there, but I've still got some poundage to go. And I'd like to build muscle as well.

But these days every time I try to push myself through towards really getting fit I stop myself. I hit a mental wall due to a fear I can hardly name. And suddenly I become hypersensitive to all things concerning gender. Such as: it's no longer ok for someone to refer to me as a woman or I get terrible pains when someone refers to me by my very effeminate given name. I get panicky when I try to assert myself and tell people that these things are not ok, but I get even more panicked when I fail to tell people.

I believe it affects my body image. Suddenly I just don't feel worth it. I get insecure and I think, ""Welp, I really will never have the more muscular body I want. Why try?"" And I realize this is nonsense.
Or I get defensive. I think to myself most people just don't seem to get it. Am I making a big deal out of this? Maybe it's not important enough. Maybe I should just accept that I'll never really be a part of the XY crowd even though there are days when I feel so much a part of it. And then I think again how terrible it is to have these thoughts! 
After all, I'd never disregard anyone else's sense of gender! I'm only allowing it because it's me.

Other days I just admit that I'm missing the point. It's not even about looks or gender at this point. It's getting healthy. It's about feeling better and having more energy and living longer.

In all honesty, I believe I'm afraid. I believe I'm afraid of the changes that will take place in my body. If I'm having a day I feel more masculine than feminine, what will this weight loss entail for me? How will that affect me? It sounds silly, but it seems frightening.

Obesity for me felt like life or death. I was told by my doctor that I'd be in a wheel chair as a young adult if I didn't drop the pounds. Now I no longer have that life or death push. It's life versus a better quality of life. I want a better quality of life. It's just I don't have the confidence to push myself to get it. The changes that I see in my body as I get closer to my goals cause me to get so panicky and upset. It all seems to force me to confront these insecurities about gender head on.

I don't feel ready. Those feelings aren't welcome. I would generally like to ignore it and play the cis gendered person in society. That too makes me very sad, but that's where I am right now. I'm not cis-gendered, so I need to learn to accept that fact.

Regardless, I shouldn't have to postpone getting healthy and taking care of myself because of having body-image issues. It's a stab in the heart every time I say to myself it's not worth it (because certainly I'm really saying I'm not worth it). Or my body will never be what I want. No matter what that can't be an excuse to not get myself in shape! 

And yet I'm having a really hard time here.

Ideas? Advice? I don't even know where to start! This is not a happy post.
