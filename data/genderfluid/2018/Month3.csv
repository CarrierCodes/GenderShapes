2018-03-03 01:19:42,81kxer,7,16,"I realized I was non binary last year. Was having a really awesome time transitioning. Felt tons of gender euphoria and like I had finally figured out something that had been just underneath the surface my entire life. I knew that although I was currently presenting more male so that others are more likely to see me more correctly (as either a guy or at least visibly queer/trans), my style preferences are actually pretty feminine, and I was waiting until HRT took a bit more effect to go back to fem stuff.

And then I woke up a couple of weeks ago, and I was a woman. In the span of perhaps a day or two, I went from complete confidence in my identity as non binary (which had lasted an entire year with many hints before I realized, so I was confident it wasn't a phase), to complete confidence that I was now a woman. It feels like my feelings, my dysphoria and euphoria and everything, have completely changed - not like I am reinterpreting my existing feelings. It feels nothing like when I realized I was non binary - when I realized that, lots of past thoughts and feelings made more sense, because I had always been non binary. Now, looking back I don't feel I was wrong when I felt those things - I was actually just non binary at that time.

I hope the following doesn't offend anyone here, but I had always been a bit confused as to how genderfluid people come to be. The scientific explanation that trans people had a variation during fetal development that caused their brain to develop differently from their body makes a ton of sense and is pretty well supported. Although I couldn't figure out why genderfluid people would exist, I certainly trusted that they did and that their experiences were real and valid. But now I feel completely taken aback, because technically speaking I'm now both cis and genderfluid - two things I didn't think I would ever be when I was feeling confident and secure in my gender for so long.

When I was having doubts because of bigoted things people said or people not believing my gender was real before, I would ask myself, ask that little inner almost subconscious voice, what gender am I? And I would always get the same answer. Neither male nor female. It was really comforting to know that no matter what anyone thought of me, I was real and I was valid, and that being non binary was a Real Thing and I was One of Them. Now when I ask that voice, it says I am a woman. Even when I was having my worst doubts and low self esteem and self hatred, that voice always held the truth for me.

I still don't believe I was repressed or delusional then - or now. I was non binary. Now I'm a woman. I'm not sad about any of the transition steps I took - I love my new name and I don't mind my friends using neutral pronouns.

It's really weird being a woman after not being one for the first 23 years of my life. I want things I've never wanted before, with regards to my body and things I want to try and what I want to look like and what I want others to assume about me when they see me. I've stopped HRT for the moment while I see where this whole being a woman thing goes.

Last week I ordered another (longer) skirt, a pair of knit cable stockings, and a lace-backed cami with a flowy front. I am excited about them, but I realized I wanted panties to go with them.

So I took the next step today and ordered a six pack of panties with cute colors and simple patterns. I'm excited and terrified. I don't even know why I'm scared. I know I will feel BEAUTIFUL in them, but the fact I'm branching out and acknowledging BOTH sides of myself in my clothes makes my hands shake.

2018-03-20 17:14:26,85ugdx,4,13,"Hii everybody. I'll try to keep this short, but who knows. 

So I'm a woman. That's what I was assigned at birth, and that's what I'm perfectly happy with being a good 90-95% of the time. I am sexually attracted to other women, and the occasional man, and I'm perfectly okay with all of this. I'm happy looking pretty.

Except when I'm not. 

Because sometimes, I'll wake up, and just feel... different. Feel like putting on my usual pretty sweaters and makeup and messy bun doesn't feel good like it usually does. I'll feel like speaking in my usual high-pitched voice sounds wrong, and like presenting myself as a femme feels forced or fake. In summary, I feel more masculine. I don't know if I feel like a guy, but I definitely don't feel like a girl.

It's so frustrating, because I don't think I look good presenting myself as more masculine. My face is too round, my hair is too long, and my voice is too soft...I look like a little girl playing dress-up. 
But the simple act of putting on a too-tight sports bra and some sweatpants can make me feel so much more at ease on these types of days. Even if I know I'm not fooling anybody, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I'm fooling myself if I walk a little different, talk a little different, dress a little different on these types of days. 

Periods of time like this can last for weeks, or just a day or two. I never know what it's gonna be. It never lasts long enough for me to feel justified in going by ""they/them"" during this time. But it's enough to give me anxiety over the matter, and over how I present myself. 

It just feels weird how I can be so comfortable being a ""She"" 90% of the time, but not be comfortable with it at all in these weird little waves. Does anyone else experience something like this? 

In summary, could I be genderfluid?

from what I'm feeling I've kind of come to the conclusion of being genderfluid. I never identify as a woman nor a man, but basically everything that's in between. Some days/weeks I feel dysphoria some days/weeks I don't. I'm afab, most of the time I feel like I'm more on the male or neutral side of the gender spectrum, but it varies.  I usually dress in quite an androgynous way, bind most days or at least wear a sports bra. I usually am perceived as female, only occasionally in winter with hats and winter clothing that hide my silhouette people will say ""he"". I'm pronoun indifferent, I don't really care about them. In English I like they, which sadly doesn't exist in my mother tongue, so I usually just go by the female pronouns because I'm used to it and usually perceived as a woman. 

All this said I've recently been struggling with the differentiation between gender and style/personality. 
I really don't know where one ends and the other begins... 
Could it be that it's just my style or my personality? but why would I feel dysphoria about my chest then? But if it's gender why don't I really care about pronouns used and how people perceive me?

I'm so confused - to an extent that I'm even doubting the existence of the gender spectrum...

Am I just a woman, a tomboy and don't care much about the concept of gender and gender roles?
or am I a genderfluid person?

I'm so confused. Where does gender begin and personality end? 

What do you think? Have you experienced anything like that / had thoughts like this?

Let me start off by saying I'm glad I found this subreddit along with several others.  I have been with my spouse for a year and a half married, 2 years before that.  She has always been much outgoing and accepting than I am due to how she was raised.  I was very closeted my entire life and am only now starting to open up and see and accept all that is around me happily.

Recently (a couple months ago) I was informed that my spouse identifies as gender fluid, leaning more female.  This was the first time I'd heard of gender fluid, but regardless I was patient and listened and support her as much as I can.  I'm still learning about the gender spectrum myself, but the past few weeks it seems she has been depressed more than usual and I know she has made at least 1 comment about her gender dysphoria and wanting to buy more mens clothes, which we have started doing.

My main question: Is there anything I can do or say to help support her through her times of depression or dysphoria?  Even simple things like just a comment in the morning or afternoon?  I am still learning about terminology and she has been so wonderful in patiently explaining things when I'm uncertain but I don't want to make her feel like I just want answers all the time.  

Sorry if this is a little rambly, but I'm not sure exactly how much information to share to get my point across.

I was very closeted my entire life and am only now starting to open up and see and accept all that is around me happily.\n\nRecently (a couple months ago) I was informed that my spouse identifies as gender fluid, leaning more female.  This was the first time I'd heard of gender fluid, but regardless I was patient and listened and support her as much as I can.  I'm still learning about the gender spectrum myself, but the past few weeks it seems she has been depressed more than usual and I know she has made at least 1 comment about her gender dysphoria and wanting to buy more mens clothes, which we have started doing.\n\nMy main question: Is there anything I can do or say to help support her through her times of depression or dysphoria?  Even simple things like just a comment in the morning or afternoon?  I am still learning about terminology and she has been so wonderful in patiently explaining things when I'm uncertain but I don't want to make her feel like I just want answers all the time.  \n\nSorry if this is a little rambly, but I'm not sure exactly how much information to share to get my point across.

A while ago I posted stating I either was genderfluid or that I'm questioning if I am. Well recently after thinking about it I actually fit into that realm more than just male or female. I'll go through days where I wish I could go out in a dress or something equally as feminine. And there are days where I'm okay with what I normally wear, and also days where I don't really care and just throw something together quickly. But the thing is I'm pretty afraid to go and experiment with anything in fear I'll be judged by everyone. Growing up I always cared more about others than myself and that's playing a role in this I believe. And I'm tired of feeling this way and I want to go and experiment with clothes and makeup but my mind always says I'll get made fun of. Well hopefully soon I'll be starting to experiment on a small scale. I'm planning on getting some bralettes or something to try wearing on the days I feel more feminine and see if that feels more right than my guy clothes. Well sorry for the rant!

It was almost a year ago that I started getting feelings that confused me a lot. Some days I was really sad and could do nothing but think about all of these feelings and other days I barely noticed them at all. Instead of really trying to figure out what **all** of these feelings meant I decided to tackle them one at the time, so to speak.

This resulted in me figuring out that I'm bisexual, something I then carried around for months but still felt really confused about up until recently, maybe a few weeks back, when I just embraced that and I no longer feel weird when I think of myself as bisexual. I'd say it feels kind of nice to have sorted that out, at least.

But with that sorted, other feelings and concerns came back to me and the last few days have been awful. When I went to bed yesterday I cried myself to sleep because my head being full of confusing feelings. At first I thought that I might just be making all of these things up in my head, but it didn't make sense since it got me so sad. I'll try and get to the point now:

I was born with male genitalia. I've never felt odd about others calling me 'he' or being referred to as 'male'. I've been at peace with my body and gender up until that time almost a year ago when I couldn't get the thoughts about it off my mind. I did lots of research on trans and all that meant but I didn't feel like that fit in on my feelings. I don't feel like I'm trapped inside a body I can't identify with, and so on.

These feelings got back to me a few days ago and I remembered a term I saw when looking up trans, which was **bi-gender**. I read about it, found a subreddit for that term but then I ended up here, because maybe this is more appropriate, as I mentioned before.

I mostly feel at peace with my body and being called 'he' and such things, but I recently been wanting to look more feminine because that's what I've been feeling like lately. Like, I've had feelings saying that I want to look more feminine, if that makes sense. I guess I've wanted to do things that *I* consider ""girly"". For instance, I had this really strong impulse to try make-up, something I've never felt or thought of before. Well, I did try it, and although it felt slightly odd or 'forbidden', I liked it. Whenever I've looked in the mirror the last few days I've thought ""would I look good as a girl?"" and then I've tried making my hair in different ways (one good thing with having long hair, heh) and well, yeah. I even shaved of my bad excuse of a beard, which I'd been trying to grow for months now, because I didn't want my face to have that masculine look to it.

I suppose that all I wanted with this post was to hear if anyone here has had similar experiences/feelings and perhaps share them with me, or possibly to help me figure out what I am feeling? I'm sort of afraid that my mind is playing tricks on me and that all these feelings aren't real...

I\'m sort of afraid that my mind is playing tricks on me and that all these feelings aren\'t real...

currently seeking support and help with gender issues.

I have taken the first step on the path of gender movement towards what makes sense to me and feels right. I was a bit surprised I found it dizzying and overwhelming and I’m not in the best shape because of it just stressed out etc not quite myself.

I feel pretty silly about the whole mess and right now wouldn’t mind just having a professional tell me its ok to do what I’m doing and I’m not just being silly/wasting everyone’s time/ and ruining a good relationship with my boyfriend of 6 months.

I’m assigned male at birth and pretty much feeling the Genderfluid vibes right now but my bf wants to see me as a man I think, which is 1 barrier. but personally i still have lots of barriers and scary areas i shudder to think about in my head so i can’t get my story straight eh. i owe my bf an explanation about my gender but i also just need to know for myself what is up.

The reason I say genderfluid is because I don’t really believe in gender as much more than a social construct (i acknowledge the difference between the sexes) and I believe in being able to express as any gender. Do I have dysphoria? big question on my mind. I certainly feel locked into my assigned gender and I feel a certain sorrow about not being able to be myself because of limitations. But I’m not into just going into a new gender where I have said limitations. Even non-binary sounds like limitations. I want to be able to act like a girl, boy, neither, or both, constantly because i just feel like that’s who I am.

Regarding all of this i’m kind of afraid of being boxed into the trans female role as what I’ve been exposed to it as. I don’t feel strongly that i’m the “wrong” gender for my body or was “a girl all along” even though I feel like I could have been way more authentic if I was allowing myself to renounce my male-ness by doing whatever I want without worrying what gender that makes me. I’m scared if I ‘let go’ and do whatever I want with my new gender freedom that it’ll just be girl stuff and I end up there anyways but I think I can face that. its just an interesting mind bender for me to get through.

Back to thrashing about on the waves.

When I cry, my air balloon deflates, and I can sink into freedom again.

When I get horny, I fill back up with water.

And then there are those weird times like today when I'm burdened with a balloon full of turbulent air, yet also held strong in girlmode, a lump of water ballooning on the ocean's surface, a big wave, both male and female.

Today I am a big wave.

2018-03-30 19:18:13,88cxsr,1,15,"tldr; scared of coming out/being myself

Hi there.
I'm Morgan, turnin' 20 this year. I am a biological female.
I've been struggling with my gender identity since forever. When I was 4-8 years old I would lash out and cry to my parents that ""it's their fault I'm not a boy"". I would not wear my shirt, I'd do all the ""boy's"" activities such as climbing trees, playing with trucks, playing football but I also loved throwing tea parties for my dolls and teddies. At the age of 12 I got ""outed"" if I might say so - one of my classmates yelled out loud during religion classes that ""MORGAN THINKS SHE'S A BOY"" and the teacher... Well.
I tried to be as girly as possible, but that didn't go well. I felt terrible, getting more and more depressed. I got diagnosed with depression, anxiety and bpd but never thought that part of my shitty feelings could be caused by dysphoria. 
At the age of 16 I started thinking about my identity. I claimed the label of ""Genderfluid"" which actually felt right.
As of now I'm out to all of my friends and some of my mates. Every time they refer to me with he/him my cheeks hurt from smiling. She/her doesn't bother me, same as they/them, they're perfectly fine.
I live in a country where even gay folks are screwed. I'm scared to talk about myself per he/him out loud because someone can hear me. My parents don't know, neither my mates that I meet every day. I'm planning on starting university in London in 2019 - even the application form has the gender option such as ""non binary"". But it's a year, even year and a half apart.
I don't want to come out bc I don't want to experience that kind of stress. I just don't know really what to do or how to do. When I see comments even from LGBT+ folks that feeling the way I'm feeling is a mental disorder I just wanna roll into small bun and die under my blanket.

2018-03-31 12:18:58,88i9oc,2,14,"TL:DR Took me 21 years to realise I was gender fluid, started owning it, feel better.


I'm not sure how to structure this, but this is my journey and I only actually realised it was a journey very recently, so I'm posting this to get my head around it and hopefully for others to look at and feel less alone in their experience as I have done with other posts on here.


My first memory of wanting to be a girl, I was about 8 or 9 and it was accompanied by my first experience of gender dysphoria. I have no idea how long it lasted, but I didn't realise it wasn't 'normal' or that it was worth talking about to anyone. 

When I was 11 I chose to play netball as a school sport, the only 'boy' to do so, I didn't want to play the masculine sports and I wanted to blend in with the girls. But I still didn't realise what it was.
Sometime around here, I began having somewhat regular dreams of being a girl, and then quite regular daydreaming about being a girl, the latter having continued to this day.


Throughout my teenage years I went through periods of never thinking about it and periods of it being big, depressing, secret thing that I struggled with silently. But I had still not learnt enough about gender identity to recognise what it was.
Whenever I got drunk and spotted myself in a mirror I often would barely recognise the image staring back because I did not identify with the sex of the person looking back. I just laughed about it and totally failed to explain to friends what that was like. 

At 16 I met a bi girl, who is now my wife, and her love for me created a buffer for my dysphoria. 

There was a party where my girlfriend and a couple of others thought it would be fun to dress up another male friend in a dress and do his make up and I so badly wanted it to be me, but could not own my identity enough to speak up, or imagine how I would explain it to anyone there. 

As an adult my girlfriends understanding of her sexuality produced periods where she identified as lesbian, which prompted me to experience more intense periods of dysphoria. A few times I expressed to her that I wished I was a girl so that she could have a partner of her preferred sex.  But didn't really explain that her preference was not responsible for this wish, just relevant or contributing.

Earlier this year, my wife came out as a lesbian, which is complicated enough on it's own, but it inspired me to look at my own identity and follow her in her braveness and begin to express my femininity.
I have never felt so body positive in my life and feel better about practically everything. 
I'm making small changes but it feels like a flood, I've started wearing women's jeans in public, shaving my legs, painting my nails and I'm getting laser hair removal done on my facial hair!
My wife bought me some pretty leggings style pyjamas that I wear at home and could not be more supportive.


I have missed so many opportunities to express myself and explore my identity, I have only just super recently realised what a colossal fuck-up it was to not own this identity earlier.

I think I wasn't okay with it, it was more like an internal problem to be ignored than anything else. 
I also figured I'll never be a girl, so there's no point bringing it up.

I’ll be honest, I DONT understand/I CANT comprehend gender fluidity, I don’t care how many times people explain to me, I don’t understand it, it’s so new to me... HOWEVER, I acknowledge it’s a real thing and I am very open to learn more, because why tf would all these people be making something up. But these people I know think it’s not a real thing just because they don’t understand it.', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'How can people be so ignorant?', 'created': 1522555281.0}"
