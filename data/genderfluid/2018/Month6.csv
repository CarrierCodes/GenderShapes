They said they could not do that because:

""we want to give visibility to women and women's issues, and our flairs are not supposed to be an exception to that. If our flairs do not suit your needs, then don't use them I guess.""

And proceeded to mute me.

So, they didn't want to accommodate a part of me that is feminine.. perhaps not as a whole, but I felt they just denied that part of me that is woman. Can't help but feel hurt about it.

I am a 30 year old, married AFAB. I have been questioning my gender for a few years now. More recently the questioning has been more insistent and in the front of my mind. 

A few months ago, I could have sworn to you I was definitely a transman. The urge and need to have a flat chest, body and facial hair, and penis were intense. Then slowly the intensity faded. I no longer had the intense need to have these things. 

The thought is always there though. My husband is the only person who knows that I'm even questioning, and he has actually been super supportive and told me he'd love me regardless. He, however, is the only one I trust to even come out to as questioning. 

There are times when I feel feminine. I dont mind wearing makeup, doing my hair and wearing dresses.

No matter what though, I only feel comfortable sexually if I am a man. I do not feel comfortable with my chest ever. I always wear a shirt and I do not like my husband playing with them. I hate that they flop around! 

I'm just so confused with who I am.

Reasons I dont believe I am for sure a man are that I do enjoy being my husbands wife, I enjoy my girl time with the few girl friends I have, and I love being a mom to my kids. Being female isnt something I hate.

Reasons I think I am a man are I hate my chest and always have, the thought of being a man excites me. I would love to have a beard and Male genitals. I can only get turned on believing I am a man and my husband calling me by my chosen male name and pronouns.

The reason I keep going back and forth are because the intensity of these feelings change. I am absolutely terrified to come out as trans or even genderfluid pr bigender because my family and friends would not be okay with this. What if I come out and realize I'm not??? What if I chose to stay female and am not as happy as I could be because I am male?

Wow! Figuring out who you are is not easy and my mind wont shut off with all these thoughts! The need to at the very least have a beard on some days and flat chest is always present. I'm terrified and I am inspired and in awe of all the people who can transition regardless of there fears!

2018-06-06 18:12:06,8p2xvu,2,4,"Hi, all, long time lurker, but finally felt the need to post something.

I've recently started thinking I might be genderfluid. Ever since I can remember, even though I'm AMAB, I've never fully felt like a boy or man. It's hard to determine if it's just because I like a lot of feminine-coded things, and generally pretty non-masculine, or if I actually have times when I'm not a man and something else. 

I've started thinking that I really do have times when I ""switch"" from guy mode to something else, probably demi-girl mode. (In part because Eddie Izzard has recently said that genderfluid most accurately describes his identity, and I've always felt like the way I feel about my own gender is how Izzard talks about his.) I try not to think about it too much: because of professional and family reasons I think it'll be a long time before I can really start experimenting with androgynous gender performance or presenting demi when feeling that way.

Now, the source of the tension: despite my growing thought that I'm probably genderfluid, the start of Pride Month has made me kind of realize that I don't really identify as a member of the LGBTQ+ community or feel like this month is for me. I guess it's a version of the kind of concern, ""What if I'm not really queer?"" But I don't know if it's just because I'm just now starting to figure myself out—so, up to this point, I *really haven't* been a member of the community—that I don't identify with this group.


Anyone experience something like this?

When I'm in guy mode, I dont want to be viewed as beautiful or pretty. I cant stand my hair, chest, and makeup is the last thing I'm worried about, however the absolute need for facial hair is intense. I also feel physically stronger, and I even tend to have a higher libido.

When I'm in girl mode, I want to be pretty. I love doing my hair. I enjoy putting on my dresses and makeup. I enjoy feeling small next to my husband. 

The problem I seem to have is that, when I'm in guy mode, the urge to chop my hair off completely and start T so i can finally grow a beard are super strong, but when I'm in girl mode, im not completely against having short hair, im just not sure i want it short...I was told I'd look butch.

2018-06-15 02:52:22,8r7op7,2,6,"So I'm not going to share my real/given name because of privacy, and I kind of don't really like it. I'm not sure if not liking it is due to something deep down, or just because my parents happened to be the ones who gave it to me. Of names that I have come across, Timothy and Jason are my favorites. I can't really make myself go by Timothy, or any form of though, because my father's name is too similar. So Jason it is. Please, call me Jay.

I'm a college student, a psychology major. I transferred to my university after 2 long ass years at community college. The community I grew up in, and spent near 21 years in, is very much conservative and religious. I'd never met anyone who wasn't straight or not strictly born male or female. Sure, they were and are there, but I only saw them from a distance, and they never stuck around for long. After coming out, they never returned the following school year. They were all demonized by the church or ostracized by the school. Anyway, after I transferred I made some friends my first semester, all of them in the marching band. We never really hung out after season was over though. So I decided to rush a sorority that's associated with the school of music.

That second semester is what I like to call both the self discovery semester and the beginning of my depression year. Long story short, my Big is gay af, and one of the most amazing humans I've ever met. In fact, a good 3/4 of the sorority is either not straight, not binary, or both. My little homophobic/transphobic ass went for a spin. I learned and I grew. I got really overwhelmed with social things and subsequently came out of some of my social anxiety. I also got overwhelmed with school work and learned the hard way that my major at the time, education, wasn't for me. Start the depression year. It was also the semester I said 'fuck it', and changed my major to psychology. I told no one. Literally walked into the psych building, filled out the papers, and took them straight to the dean's office. I told no one until a couple weeks later when I got a tentative acceptance to the major, dependent on me passing a summer class.

The beginning of my 2nd year at university, it was a time. I finally got to see the inner workings of my sorority, and all of the drama within it. I still love them anyway. I was bullied in marching band for having panic attacks during auditions. I finished the pre-reqs for my major.

In August I discovered that I am asexual. I came out to my best friend in September.

In November I discovered my attraction to women, in addition to men. So I came out as biromantic.

Biromantic asexual.

It wasn't until this past semester, maybe around February, that I started feeling something different. I wasn't quite sure what it was. Due to the environment of where I grew up, I was never allowed to explore anything regarding myself. Basically a carbon copy of my parents. But after almost 2 years of living in a college town, I felt something. Something that I needed to explore. At first I thought I might be a trans male, but it didn't fit.

The feeling comes and goes, and it varies in strength. Sometimes I feel a little feminine, though rarely. Sometimes I feel masculine, though not entirely. I often feel in between, kind of neither. I think I lean more toward masculine and that somewhere in between, rarely going to feminine. I don't know if it's really something I feel within me, or if it's a part of me rejecting how and where I was raised, forced into the feminine role and stereotype.

There are some aspects of femininity I'm not sure I want to give up. But there are so many things I don't want to be a part of. I feel more comfortable in more masculine things. Today especially, being in a clothing store and longing to buy 'men's' jeans, boxers, and suits. I know that clothing doesn't have gender, but it's like a longing to look like them. To be lean and fit with boyish long hair. To be able to pull off a suit like that. Something my really af female body can't do, at least it the way I want it too.

I don't like my female body or my female name. I want a masculine or androgynous body with a masculine name. But I'm afraid. Sometimes I feel like I desperately want to transition to male. Sometimes I feel comfortable enough just downplaying my more feminine features. Sometimes I want to cut my long ass hair into that boyish cut, but I'm terrified I'll instantly regret it and have to live with it. I'm afraid to tell my friends, even though I know they'd be totally accepting. The only time I can admit it to myself is when I've had at least half a bottle of wine. So take this as my testament.

I don't know wtf I am. I want to explore, but I'm terrafrickingfied. I've just gained acceptance into my friend group, and I don't want to jeopardize that. I have no idea who I am or who I want to be. Sometimes I want to be the person I've grown to be, even with the name and baggage that comes with what I was assigned. Sometimes I want to go for it, be Jason, be him, a part of me. Some part of me desperately wants out, and I have no idea if it's a suppressed part of me, or if it's the Jason I've suppressed all my life.

I'm still living with my parents and I'm unemployed. I'm probably not cis, considering how long I've been thinking about this, but I'd like someone else's thoughts and maybe some advice.

I was starting to think that bi-gender and genderfluid fit me the most, but I'm having doubts basically everyday now. I've been questioning for so long that it feels like it's never going to end and the uncertainty is killing me... So, I thought it might help if I make a post here to see what other people think since I don't trust my own perception? Idk, this post is probably going to be long so skip to the tl;dr if you'd prefer. I really just need to spill my guts to someone.

(Might be slightly NSFW at parts, by the way)

For background: As a child, I never really experienced any dysphoria. I was happy being a girly girl, and sometimes a tomboy, not really thinking anything of my gender. I can recall a few hints, but only once I started middle school. I clearly recall envying characters like Haruhi from OHSHC (yes, very cliche) for being able to pass as both a girl and boy. I always wished I could be them. And I remember distinctly this one time my dad was driving me to school, and I thought how cool would be if I could just crossdress as a boy to school for a week and have no one know. I would fantasize what it would be like to be a boy for a day more than once throughout my teen years. Plus, I was kinda into yaoi back then (another cliche, huh?). I've also struggled with depression and anxiety since I was 10 or younger, but towards the end of my teens, I felt like my medication wasn't helping me much anymore inexplicably. What confuses me most is that I learned about being trans and non-binary about when I was 14-15 years old on tumblr, definitions and all, yet it never clicked back then? I thought maybe I could be agender for a moment but I quickly abandoned that idea... I never understood genderfluid tho, until... well, now. The fact that none of it ever clicked and I don't think I ever felt blatant dysphoria is kinda messing with me. The only time I can recall having something close to dysphoria, is was when my boobs grew into size B and the first thing that came to mind is, ""Fuck, it's going to be harder to bind -- for crossplay of course!!"". I felt weirdly upset, despite wanting a bigger chest when I was younger... that confused me at the time.

I guess I always blew it off for one big reason. I've always have been into girly things, mostly in fashion. I LOVE being cute and wearing pastel colors. I love sweet lolita, fairy kei and other super feminine styles and aesthetics. For reasons like that I've always felt reasonably secure in my womanhood and took pride in it even. 

But thanks to one too many gay shitposts on here, I think I've opened Pandora's box on myself. A lot of the doubts so I'm having are the typical ones; ""it's just a fetish"" (since these feelings first manifested themselves as sexual fantasies), ""I could just be a crossdresser"" (and explanation that doesn't really satisfy me), and ""but you're so feminine"" (yeah sure, but man do I want to specifically be a cute BOY as opposed to a cute girl a lot sometimes). But the one that makes me the most scared is that I've somehow convinced myself that I'm trans/non-binary to fit in better with the queer or """"""s j w"""""" community. That I'm just a cis girl invading trans spaces and ""pretending"" to be one of them. I know it sounds a lot like the typical (and toxic as all hell) ""transtrenders"" argument, but I can't stop thinking about it. Especially since whenever I imagine what I would ideally like to look like when I present as a boy fits perfectly into the ""uwu soft boy"" stereotype, pastel colors and all. But I don't want to be butch. I don't want facial hair or muscles. I just what to be seen as a cute boy sometimes. I can't deny that ever since I've admitted to myself that I might be genderfluid, I started to pay more attention to my chest... Now I think about how I wish my chest was flatter, and that I was born with male genitalia instead of female. Heck, I've been wishing I was born with both mostly tbh. I don't hate being a girl, I enjoy it even but... not all the time. I don't want to completely abandon that part of me tho. If I had to guess, I think I'm in very much of a boy swing right now, if that makes any sense? (But I have no idea what pronouns to settle on) I think about this stuff daily by now, and I have no irl friends to talk to and I've been afk on and off with my buddies (who I'm not out to) on discord for so long now it's hard for me to bring myself to talk to them regularly again. I'm closeted mostly (this is an alt account I made specifically for lgbtqa+ things/anything I wouldn't want my mom to see), with super conservative parents who would never believe me. And all this is just eating away at me... At this point I'm not sure if I'm just a confused cis person, genderfluid/bi-gender, or even a feminine trans man. I'm just sure I'm hurting pretty bad right now... 

So, what do you all think? What advice, if any, do you have for me? Anything that would help me confirm my identity would help, since I have trouble dealing with uncertainty like this.

2018-06-20 00:09:55,8sdtlf,2,15,"Lurker that finally decided to post with a new account...I'm kinda dumping some possibly troubling topics, so... **slight trigger warning.**

Dysphoria is strong today. AFAB and generally present as a woman, but some days it's really difficult. I just want to bind and cut my hair short, to see the male version of myself in person instead of in my mind's eye. I can't ever fully transition because this only happens once in a while and I know the second I feel ""female"" again I'll miss my hair and curves.

Way before I knew gender-fluidity was a thing: When I was little, I wished I was Mystique from X-Men. I used to fantasize about having the ability to switch between being male or female at will.  Hell, I still fantasize about it. I can feel the switch in my mind, how it changes my attitude, my gait, the way I sit and talk. 

I almost walked into the men's restroom once because a guy walked in just before me. I said once, ""Oh hey, there's an even amount of guys and girls going to this thing, that's funny."" as a date joke, and realized I counted myself as one of the guys. In church camp I cross-dressed and ""infiltrated"" the boys side as joke, it was cringey obvious I wasn't passing, but we all had a good laugh. In high-school, people who knew me would joke that I had a male alter ego (theater was a great place to get away with cross-dressing) and I responded to both names without hesitation. I didn't mind either pronoun. Halloween, I was an ""emo guy"". Basically any opportunity I had to be male, I took. Looking back, I was very fortunately part of the theater group that was very accepting and no one ever made fun of me to my face.

I was hesitant to identify as trans, as there were times I liked being a girl and I wasn't willing to take hormones or get surgery. I was attracted to men, too. It took a long time to find someone who was interested in dating the girl-bro. I used to think, Geez, am I so boy-crazy that I want to be one of them?

I used to think I was like this because I was raised in a mostly male household. Bunch of brothers and a distant mother. My dad was very close to me, close enough to make my brothers jealous and family question if something weird went on. Nothing serious happened, but he heavily relied on me emotionally as my mom was depressed (they divorced when I was in my teens). If you want to learn more look up ""covert abuse"" or ""emotional incest"". If you feel like you are your parent's partner in the household or someone you know is, I'd suggest looking up. However mild it's good to know how it affects you in your other relationships. [Here's a good article.](https://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/emotional-covert-incest-when-parents-make-their-kids-partners-0914165) 

My Dad was a good person and did his best, but no one's perfect and new studies come out every year showing how certain parenting behaviors are actually bad. He didn't know what he was doing was harmful, and if he was malicious or narcissistic it could have been so much worse. He needed emotional intimacy and I was the only girl around. It made setting up emotional boundaries difficult which led to certain events in adulthood. 

So I went to therapy to deal with those events. My therapist mentioned that my gender dysphoria could be because I felt like if I was a boy, then I'd be the same as my brothers and the bad or uncomfortable and sometimes physical attention would stop. I feel like that's a possibility to my own personal journey in this. I'd like to point out that I knew that my relationship to my father was problematic before I saw my therapist, who confirmed it, but I didn't consider it could have affected my gender identity until then. Just in case someone misreads this, I'm not saying all gender identity can be due to childhood problems, just that I think mine has a strong possibility. I don't know if I would be the same if my childhood was healthier. My mom was a tomboy, and still does masculine things even if she won't admit it. She's homophobic, but when I explained gender-fluidity to her once, she said she wished there was a term like that when she was a kid. So that was interesting for me to hear. 

I know it's different for everyone, but for me when I'm a boy I feel confident and more likely to take risks. I wear looser clothes and I walk with my head up. When I feel like a girl, I feel small and I look at the ground. Some days it's a perfect mix. Either I literally don't care how I present, or I'll wear make-up but still wear my ""boy clothes"" and it feels like I'm balanced. 

Sorry, this was a huge info dump. I hope everything formatted ok...Thanks for reading all this. You're amazing.

Anyone here ever wonder if coming out was worth it? I came out about a year ago to a select handful of people like my wife, therapist, and close friends. Not much has changed since. While it is nice to talk about struggles with dysphoria and I’ve gotten a little room to explore gender expression, my day to day has hardly changed. I’m less depressed than I used to be but I’m wondering if coming out was worth the strains that it put on relationships in my life. 

It feels like I was dealing with a lot of the stress and hardship internally, only to deal with the same amount (or arguable more) externally within my relationships. It has me wishing that I had kept quiet and just pushed down feelings. That’s healthy, right?

2018-06-24 16:04:35,8tir5q,3,9,"Warning that I'm not good at writing my thoughts out, so this post might be confusing or a mess idk.

I've been questioning my gender for a while, but it constantly confuses me. One day I come to a conclusion, the next day 'll be like,""Wait, I should think that over again"" or,""Nah, I'm not really &lt;gender&gt;""

I've been thinking I'm something more ambiguous or flowing like genderfluid or nonbinary instead of straight up transgender because my feelings on my gender are a bit weird sometimes.

Sometimes I feel indifferent to my gender, then sometimes I feel too attached to being female. I have the weird thought too that if I was male, I would be okay with any pronoun, but being female I prefer female pronouns only I guess??

And then sometimes I question my gender for a while, then I forget about and go back to feeling cis and fine with everything, thinking,""I wouldn't mind being a guy, but I don't absolutely need to be that or anything.""

One reason I doubt that I'm really trans or anything is because one of the main reasons for questioning my gender is because I hate my female genitals when thinking of them in a sexual context. I feel like I'd feel better having sex or masturbating or having sex if I had a penis. ..but then I forget about sexual things, my libido is pretty much non existent for months, and I don't mind my female parts.

I kind of fetishize and romanticize myself as a guy too, always imagining sexual things or just a guy version of me who's nothing like me and better than me.

When I imagine myself as a guy, it doesn't feel like ""me"" really, but just something that would make me happier I guess? I feel more confident and stuff when I imagine that, but it just doesn't feel like me. I don't feel like I'm male in any way, amd I don't know if I feel all that female either, but in a way, I do?? like I definitely feel more female than male, but then I forget what that means and wonder why I'm saying I ""feel"" a gender, even though I hate those arguments that gender isn't a feeling, because I know I'm female (kind of??) because it just feels right to me?? I guess if I had to describe how my gender really feels, I feel like I'm weakly female, or like something between nonbinary and female, yet when I think about my body, I feel alright with being female, but imagining myself with a male body sounds cool to me. And yet my pronoun preference is weird, possibly being okay with anything if I was a guy (probably because I've never been one, so I'm not used to it like I am with my ASAB)  but being only comfortable with female pronouns as a girl...

This post is a mess and I probably could've written it better, but that's how I feel and it's weird and confusing. My gender in my head is female-ish, and yet I wish I had a male body, but at the same time I don't mind my female body and sometimes forget about questioning my gender and feel completely fine with being cis. I feel fake and like I'm just obsessing over a persona because being male just doesn't feel like me, but I feel confident and happier sometimes when I imagine myself as a guy. Sometimes I worry this is just a coping mechanism for my low esteem, like it;s just a character I like to imagine myself as because it's not exactly me and because being a girl has never been that important to me, yet I'm attached to it as an identity at the same time.... idfk????

When I got a bit older I still loved dolls and pink things, but I also enjoyed playing with the boys and wanted toy cars and to do sports like baseball. I went through a phase as a teenager where I felt I might be transgender and dressed as masculine as possible. I have always had issues with having breasts and a female shaped body. 

Once I got into college I sort of shifted so that now I don't enjoy dressing as dark and borderline goth as I did as a teenager, but I still really enjoy wearing male clothing. But, I have also developed enjoyment wearing female clothing and acting more feminine sometimes. It really depends on my mood. I have such a hard time finding clothes I like to wear since I have a curvy body.

Besides wondering if I was trans when I was younger (which I didn't do too much of because I was trying to make it go away since I wasn't in a position where it would be safe for me to come out and live as trans), I have never really put much thought into potentially being on the LGBT spectrum (I've had much larger issues in my life that have preoccupied my time and concern, my gender identity wasn't something that I could prioritize).

2018-06-25 08:04:02,8tos2b,6,15,"Recently I have been trying to come to terms with myself. After indulging myself into some unhealthy means of coping with what I now suspect is repressed dysphoria (I found a way to counter it with endorphins) I have started to consider the fact that I might indeed be gender fluid. 

Now for some background, I started out crossdressing when I was about 13/14, and while initially it started out for sexual release, I soon found myself enjoying the feeling of being pretty etc. Sadly where I live, coming out as something other than gay is not exactly common (I know for a fact my parents while trying to understanding, would not be able to fully come to terms with how I feel), so for a long time I ignored what I felt and compartmentalized it. 

The dysphoria would re-appear when I am stressed, and on those days I started to use crutches to convince myself that it was all a phase/a part of an unhealthy habit I had developed. I started to work to kick the habit and have managed thankfully. 

Now around 14/15 I had stopped crossdressing period. At that point puberty hit me like a truck, and borrowing clothes from my sister felt gross and a violation of her privacy. Now that I am in my 20s and have the means to actually consider buying my own clothes, depending on how masculine or feminine I feel I find myself occasionally checking out what my female friends are wearing and feeling jealous they can pull it off. 

After reading up on gender fluidity and bi-gender people I have started to suspect I may fall on one of these specturms. I do love being a dude, and don't plan/want to transition (I have a friend who is in the process, and while I am incredibly happy for her, I do not wish to follow her path).

Going more in either direction felt wrong and made me hate myself).

2018-06-26 07:45:40,8ty6i6,8,6,"Hello r/Genderfluid!

I created a Reddit Account just to gain alittle knowledge about my predicament, so I hope you lovely people can help. I guess I need to supply some background information right? 

I was AMAB (Assigned Male At Birth) and have never really had a problem with it. No problems until recently that is. 

This is the most disorganized post ever but please stick with me, I'm going through alot currently. 

I've always felt different from other people, well somedays. This is really had to explain, I've never really opened up like this to anyone. I've always articulated myself in a feminine way. As a child in elementary school I remember being girly with one of my best-friends (mainly just mannerisms and dialect). No one ever commented on my femininity until middle school. This is when the ""gay rumors"" began to start, nothing too extreme. In middle school I had a group of biological females who I would always keep myself around (They seemed to accept my femininity). I never got along with many of the guys in my middle school, I just didn't gravitate to them. My feminine mannerisms became more obvious with me entering high school as a freshmen though, and of course, those ""gay rumors"" began again and never really stopped. 

You're probably asking yourself, ""Why is this person giving me an entire rundown of their life?"" Well I think you will need this information to answer my question. 

Once in high school, I began to realize that maybe I was different then the others. Not in a special snowflake sorta way either. All jokes aside.

I began to articulate my femininity in many ways: I grew out my hair, painted my nails, dressed in women's clothing, and of course, my mannerisms helped this process. This made me feel a sort of comfort with my physical body most days. Somedays I would wake up and wipe the nail polish off of my nails, almost as if to say ""you're a boy, you're not supposed to wear this."" I guess these days I would just stay quiet and dress in a sort of general manner. 

I am tremendously sorry for writing this much, I just need to get it out. 

I began to go along with the ""girly boy"" jokes and agree with them with a smile. Adopting a skinny jeans only wardrobe and a fashionable, always perfect, hairstyle. This made me happy, to just be. Be me, who I felt in that moment. 

Now, down to the interesting points. Tremendous amounts of self hate and research later. I perused the internet for a label for weirdness with myself and discovered Non-binary and Genderqueer. These two labels didn't work with me because I do feel a certain ""ways"" on different days. I feel feminine on most days and masculine on the others, and some just meh and neither (on these days I don't really care). I found this obscure label called Genderfluid and it seems to fit, but there's one problem. 

When I identify as Genderfluid, it makes me happy, momentarily, but I still feel a hole in my heart, so to speak. I still feel empty, like I haven't found myself. I've kinda developed a disliking for my male sex and have thought of gender reassignment surgery, but this seems too extreme for me. 

According to you wonder people of this Sub-Reddit, Am I Genderfluid?

Fun question, I know, you must get this one alot. 

Any advice for this self-doubting person?

I guess I need to supply some background information right? \n\nI was AMAB (Assigned Male At Birth) and have never really had a problem with it. No problems until recently that is. \n\nThis is the most disorganized post ever but please stick with me, I\'m going through alot currently. \n\nI\'ve always felt different from other people, well somedays. This is really had to explain, I\'ve never really opened up like this to anyone. I\'ve always articulated myself in a feminine way. As a child in elementary school I remember being girly with one of my best-friends (mainly just mannerisms and dialect). No one ever commented on my femininity until middle school. This is when the ""gay rumors"" began to start, nothing too extreme. In middle school I had a group of biological females who I would always keep myself around (They seemed to accept my femininity). I never got along with many of the guys in my middle school, I just didn\'t gravitate to them. My feminine mannerisms became more obvious with me entering high school as a freshmen though, and of course, those ""gay rumors"" began again and never really stopped. \n\nYou\'re probably asking yourself, ""Why is this person giving me an entire rundown of their life?"" Well I think you will need this information to answer my question. \n\nOnce in high school, I began to realize that maybe I was different then the others. Not in a special snowflake sorta way either. All jokes aside.\n\nI began to articulate my femininity in many ways: I grew out my hair, painted my nails, dressed in women\'s clothing, and of course, my mannerisms helped this process. This made me feel a sort of comfort with my physical body most days. Somedays I would wake up and wipe the nail polish off of my nails, almost as if to say ""you\'re a boy, you\'re not supposed to wear this.""

2018-06-26 09:43:31,8typpx,17,7,"Long post, sorry, just writing down some thoughts if that's ok. I don't have many ppl I can talk to abt this.
So I saw this thread on a trans sub (I think transspace, not sure rn), abt when and how people started realising they were trans, how these feelings/thoughts manifested and what things from childhood now make more sense with the understanding of their trans selves.
I've been thinking abt that as well, recently, but with that came the reaffirming of my genderfluidity in ways that I was... not necessarily expecting. That's not to say that I wasn't sure, simply that I hadn't thought as far back as my preteens on what might have been signs.
For example, my neighbourhood friends and I used to play house and all that and I never understood why the girls wanted to play the girl part and the boys play the boy part, I just wanted to play the 'married' part, so to speak. We used to run around pretending we were animals -dogs, cats, elephants, you name it. The girls always said stuff like ""I'm a girl cat"", ""I'm a girl giraffe"" or the boys preferred playing dogs and lions and tigers bc they said those are 'boy animals', while I always just wanted to be 'a' dog, 'a' cat. This was around when I was 7-10 years old. 
Then we started play acting Sailor Moon episodes, and I always wanted to be Tuxedo Mask bc his outfit thrilled me, but I never gave his _gender_ much thought. 
Then I started drawing and the first things I drew were animals -yes, I do love animals, no I am not a furry XD- and my folks always asked me if my drawings were of a boy leopard or a girl leopard, and I kind of...distinctly remember the feeling of confusion bc, well, I didn't know. It didn't matter. It was 'a' leopard. That's all that mattered to me. 
Then when I got to drawing humans, I gravited towards switching the 'norm' between genders, as in girls would get short haircuts and determined, scowling looks, the boys I drew got colorful clothes and I really liked drawing men dancing ballet for some reason. This is obviously also a young me's interpretation of -and sort of rebellion against- the norms of the society I was raised in, but I'm just now realizing how early-on I started feeling...'different' abt genders. 
Anyways. Sorry for the long post, but I'd love to hear other people's stories. Like I said, I literally know nobody else among my friends who has experienced this, so I don't get to swap stories irl.

2018-06-27 01:18:37,8u5ho7,6,6,"Hi everyone! So I’m a 24 year old AMAB person who has been struggling with my gender since this past October. Basically, after wanting to crossdress since I was 11 and suppressing it, I started wearing women’s clothes last year.

Eventually, I started wearing women’s clothing in public and that was when I began to think, “Maybe I’m trans.” From that point on, the feeling kind of snowballed to a point where I really felt sure that I was a woman, and I was feeling a lot of distress ( I guess I could call it dysphoria) over my maleness. And then, suddenly it went away, and I felt male for a bit. And that lasted a few months. Then back to female, back to male, and so on. There are times when I really feel terrible about being male, and I daydream about being born a cis girl. And I think I’d be happier if I were a cis girl. I feel the dysphoria, and I imagine what could’ve been and could be. But I always reach a point where I once again feel content being male.

So, is this genderfluidity, the coming and going of dysphoria, or both? I’ve always felt uncomfortable at the idea of not being binary. Like, if I’m not binary, then I’m nothing. My therapist has told me that I care too much about being a man or a woman in the “right way”. 

I’m honestly just so tired of going back and forth. If I had to choose, I would choose for the feeling of being a woman to stay. The dysphoria sucks, but I feel better when I think of being a woman. 

Anyway, thanks so much for reading this, and thanks in advance for your help. ❤️

2018-06-29 21:07:25,8uwou4,6,11,"Sorry if this isn't allowed, but I feel the need to vent a bit.

This week has been an utter whirlwind for me, however the last two days have felt incredibly monumental for a couple of reasons; I came out to one of my closest friends and the dude was incredibly supportive, and for the first time in about 3 years I faced my dysphoria head on instead of burying my head in the sand.

For the first part, I was incredibly nervous. Despite knowing the dude for years I didn't really know how to tell him that I'm gender fluid as it didn't really seem like something that would come up. Through sheer luck, he brought up the topic himself while we were discussion recent events, and he made it a point to mention that he didn't care about how people identified as long as they were good people, and didn't treat him differently. I ended up telling him it was a good thing I fit both criteria since I am gender fluid. He thought I was joking at first, but when he realised I was serious he was as I mentioned, incredibly supportive and told me if I ever need to talk about it he'd be happy to listen. I freaking love the guy (platonically speaking). 

Moving onto the second part of my post, I finally did something I hadn't done in years; I ended up crossdressing. It was only for a few minutes, and I was using an old dress that hadn't been worn in years, but for the first time in literal years, I didn't feel like some random guy trying to pretend to be a woman. When I looked down I felt like a normal person and well a bit attractive. This is a huge step for me, as while I did have this feeling when I started out, over the years I subdued it to the point where it felt lost. 

Right now despite the renewed interest, I do not have any plans to start crossdressing, at least not until I move out properly and can actually afford to buy my own clothes etc, but the fact that I can do it again without feeling like a complete and utter fraud, is incredibly liberating.

I'd also just like to take a moment to thank you all again for being such an awesome community. When I made my first post I was utterly terrified, but you all made me feel incredibly welcome, and for that I'll be forever thankful.
