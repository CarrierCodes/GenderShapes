2018-02-01 08:50:14,7uhgcj,14,1,"So! Long story short-- I've been struggling with my gender identity for as long as I can remember and I only recently (last year) starting ID'ing as Genderfluid.

I've always thought maybe I was a transman (I'm AFAB) but stepping into any of those spaces always had me very spooked. I think the idea of fully being ONE gender-- in body and mind-- has always scared me a lot? 

But I think the idea of ""wanting a penis sometimes"" had me convinced that I HAD to be a transman to have those thoughts? Which I know now is NOT the case-- tho ideally I think I would be equipped with both parts? (Hope I'm not the only one...;;)

So talking to other Genderfluid people last year really helped a lot...(cosplay helps too!)
Even just now, roaming thru this sub I bit-- I feel such relief.

My gender has always given me such bad anxieties and I've struggled so much with worse and worse dysphoria as I've gotten older-- I feel so afraid so much of the time like somehow I'm not...gender-fluid-y? enough to ID.

I don't know-- this post got really rambly really fast so I guess I just wanted to express how happy I am to have found this sub!

I also wanted to ask if anyone had any tips for dysphoria? Specifically dysphoria while masturbating/having sex? 

(I struggle feeling incomplete sometimes because it feels like I NEED A PENIS to feel completely whole in my body. Like I'm a puzzle and that's the last piece.)

Does a packer help on particularly boy-ish days? Has anyone used a Feeldoe for a type of simulation?

Hope none of this is TMI. I appreciate everyone's patience with me! Thank you!

2018-02-12 19:52:56,7x3gue,3,9,"Hi there everybody! This is my first post on Reddit so I thank you in advance for your time and insight! 

I am long time illustrator, designer, husband and father of three kids in rural Arkansas. I recently made the jump to full time freelance illustration and design. 

A year or two ago, my family and I decided to start a series of books for kids. I am working on the first book now and have some questions for this subreddit's subscribers. (But because I'm nervous about being accused that I'm trying to sell something, I am going to share what will help now and soon I will share the name and where to find out more). One of primary inspirations for the books was to create something for kids that was not gender driven while at the same time, not pandering to non-conforming or questioning kids. Some of that inspiration came from personal experience. I am basically straight with a few exceptions of little consequence, mostly having to do with fingernail polish. But most of it came from wanting to contribute to a world where children like my sons (twins, both under ten and gender non-conforming, one much more so than the other) had something to read that depicted gender fluid characters who were living their good life, was not heavy-handed or lesson driven, was clean, and wasn't even always about them. 

In my limited research I've found stuff out there for questioning kids/teens, transgender kids/teens, et al. But most of what I found was either overly sexualized or pandered and focused too much on *tolerating* differences, avoiding all nuance and story telling craft. All of them missed the opportunity to simply show characters who aren't add odds with themselves and supporting characters who aren't just *mystified* by the gear-head, skirt-wearing self-identified girl. 

So long story short, we got started on the first book. Gender doesn't even come up in it. Readers who are familiar with it's history will know one of the main characters identifies as a girl but ""was born a Larry"". But it does not figure into the story, which has about six other characters, one of which could be assumed by readers to be a lesbian, but again, it doesn't come up. 

Other important subtexts within the overall series is:
* It is set in rural Arkansas and will hopefully resonate quite a bit with anybody who, even begrudgingly, has a connection to southern, ""uneducated"", rural upbringing or lineage.

* It incorporates the natural and unnatural landscape and regional history deeply, but subtly, into the story

* We have an ambitiously wide audience in mind. From 3 to 25 years old. For that reason, and others, sexual expression never comes into the story. I know there is global discussion as to what sexual expression can look like from the youngest and agree that some simple outward expressions of gender can be conceived of as Freudian sexual communications. But that is missing the forrest for the trees. Our stories will not be about dissecting what it *means* to be kid/adult who is exploring gender. They will be about what it could look like to be someone who is exploring gender among peers who affirm by utilizing the same wide range of enthusiasms they'd bestow upon other kids. 

All this is to (finally) get to my request for advice. As a freelancer in great hideout of Arkansas, I don't make a ton of money so most of my free time is spent trying to drum up freelance work. Which cuts deeply into my time to illustrate this project. So, we've started seeking Patreon supporters to help make ends meet. The end goal ideally being that I switch over to full time story telling and illustrating of this project. But I am not a particularly charismatic sales person, nor do I have the time to spend seeking support in any substantial way. Soooo…

**Based on your current limited knowledge of the project, what would inspire *you* personally to consider supporting? I especially want to hear your thoughts if you live in or have close ties to rural southern communities where being a non-binary person of any age can be especially hard. And gender driven media is just about the only option.** 

I'm super excited about working on this project for years to come, so let me know what questions you have! Because this is the internet and people are always being conniving, I'm will share links to images, articles, websites, etc. related to the project once people are engaged or by request. *But rest assured, this is a real and good thing!* 

With love and gratitude,
GreatHonker

2018-02-14 06:16:55,7xg2a5,5,8,"Okay so I'm 25 years old (AFAB) and in a male dominated field and have always been more of a ""tomboy"".. I grew up in a house with a very homophobic father who constantly pushed me to be more ""girly"" and it took me until pretty recently to realize that I've always liked women (as well as men) but closed myself off to that idea because I lived at home. Even now that I live on my own I'm only out and open with select friends and my partner (male) about that. I'm also attracted to nonbinary folks and really anyone? So I don't even know what to label that but since I'm outwardly in a ""hetero"" relationship I don't feel the pressure to be out about anything.

My problem is that as more time has progressed I find that I really like being referred to as a boy. It started a few years ago. When I still lived at home I couldn't dress as masculine as I wanted but I still would manage to encorporate some male clothing into my wardrobe. So much so that when I would go out with female friends that they would refer to me as their ""little boyfriend"". And being called that felt really good. At work, being a small girl and being surrounded by guys, a few of them started referring to me as their brother, or affectionately, ""little brother"". And it felt really really good to hear that and be called that and on days when I dress masculine I love referring to myself as a boy or man. Or being called handsome. I still like to wear feminine clothes sometimes and don't have major problems with my body (some days I do). And I don't mind when anyone uses she/her pronouns-- but I can't tell if it's because I think it would be silly for someone to call me he/him. Like I'm not actually deserving or masculine or boy enough for those pronouns? 

Some days I can't describe it, but I just want to be in this body that feels strong and sturdy and dressing it up that way makes me feel so good. Like I'm me, but a different kind of me..??

This has been messing with me. I literally have not spoken to a single person about it. I don't know what to make of myself and maybe it doesn't mean anything? Maybe I just like being called a boy sometimes? I don't know. I really just want someone to tell me if this is worth thinking depely about. Is it wrong to hide these thoughts from my boyfriend and my friends? Am I lying about myself?

2018-02-15 15:22:52,7xr18v,3,5,"The Scottish Government is currently consulting on proposed changes to Gender Recognition.

The main points are:

* **Self declaration**  
Let trans people get official recognition of their gender without the current requirement of a psychiatric report.
* **16-17 year olds**  
Let trans people apply for gender recognition from 16, the age at which young people in Scotland are deemed to have full legal capacity.
* **Non-binary**  
Let non-binary people have their gender fully legally recognised through self-declaration.

This consultation is **vital** and closes on the 1 March at 17:00 (GMT). If the Scottish Gov gets more negative responses than positive ones it will be extremely difficult for them to justify updating legal gender recognition. If the number of negative responses is large then the rights of trans people are at risk of being rolled back, not only in Scotland but also in the whole of the UK.

**Most unfortunately, the media has been particularly hostile about trans equality in recent weeks and so there is a REAL RISK that this negative media coverage will encourage a larger number of negative responses. So now more than ever we need people to respond to the consultation!**

Please take 10 min to complete a positive response. You can find a guide and link to the consultation at

**http://equalrecognition.scot/consultation/**

Not all the questions need to be answered. Even saying something simple like “I support trans rights” already helps. They do ask for a name and e-mail address but these can be kept confidential.

**Background:** Hi, masculine cis male throwaway here. Been hanging out with a trans friend of mine lately, figuring out my sexuality (I've identified as hetero for most of my life, but have come to find I'm A-OK with anyone who is feminine).

Through this friend, I've been introduced to an absolutely lovely, very feminine AMAB genderfluid individual who I'd learned, to my surprise, thought I was cute. We've been texting each other for two days now and we're both down for hanging out more.

I haven't been in a *romantic* relationship before. We cuddled last night and it felt great.

As I understand from what they've told me/my friend told me, their identity/behavior changes depending on social context rather than over time, ie: feeling more feminine in a room of men. AFAIK their preferred appearance doesn't change, but their behavior does.

**Questions so far:**

1. I really like this person so far and want to take their interest and run with it. What can I do/should I keep in mind to avoid fucking this up?

2. Does their fluidity mean that they'd generally be feminine with me? I don't think being masculine sometimes would be a dealbreaker, but I'm unsure of what their masculine state entails.
