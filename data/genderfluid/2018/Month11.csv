2018-11-12 20:06:32,9whktt,6,1,"So I'm really nervous because this is my first post in a very long time so sorry if it sounds scattered. Anyways, I am very confused about how I feel. I am AFAB currently identifying as genderfluid. Typically, I am more feminine in the summer months and more masculine in the winter months (I usually switch between female, male, and agender)

For a long time I was comfortable with this label, but now I'm facing this horrible, uncomfortable, and just sickening feeling of not knowing who I am anymore. Every time I say that I am genderfluid, something just feels off. Sometimes, I want to dress masculine and present myself as a male (even though I do not look the part at all. Still working on that) but I feel guilty and uncomfortable. I feel sick and just like its not worth it to try. I dress pretty androgynous anyways but its still leaning on the feminine side of things. I even bought a binder, but can't bring myself to wear it because I feel too guilty and anxious to leave my room with it on. I just feel so sick and guilty and depressed about it all. 

Pronouns are a mystery to me and I've tried different ones out and they just don't do much for me. 

I try to talk with my therapist about it and she just changes the subject or shuts me down saying ""but, you don't really have to know yet do you?"". And like, I see where she comes from and I don't mind not knowing. I mind being so incredibly uncomfortable and feeling so guilty that all I want to do is cry and sleep. 

Sorry I know that was long and complete word vomit, but do any of you guys have any advice? Is what I'm feeling dysphoria? (because I don't want to use that term just in case I don't have it and then offend people, ect.) Any tips to help it?

I have never ever had PMS symptoms this bad before (if it is PMS, my birth control if fine and I checked with my gynecologist).

I also discovered that I have something like a split personality, who is male. However he doesn't really want to come out or sees much of a point to it. I did discover him 3 months ago as well. My personality will be the same almost every day (female, Julia). However the body will undergo that female to male change, and the mind will follow or vice versa.

2018-11-15 18:48:49,9xe0co,7,1,"So back story. I've recently started dating this gender fluid person. They have all the ""lady bits"" as they refer to them. I really like them, but I've always considered myself a straight cis Male. I find them physically attractive because I'm into the female body. But sometimes when they are more masculine and being more Male sometimes I feel gay(not that there is anything wrong with that) because I emotionally like them regardless of their gender at the time. But in those moments there is a little feeling of just, and I don't know how to describe it any other way, wrongness.

2018-11-23 16:58:16,9zpwmw,2,1,"Hi! I’m Emma. At least, I feel that way right now. I don’t quite understand what it is that I’m feeling. Starting at the beginning...

I’ve lived my whole 38 years as Chris, cis-male. He/him and without question into feminine. I accepted a while ago that while I prefer female sexual parts, I’m not repulsed by male parts; I however am NOT into masculine, like, at all. 

I’ve always felt kind of... off. I don’t hate my body, and i don’t hate my parts. On and off throughout my life, I’d wondered “what if there was a surgery where like you switched brains with a woman like a brain transplant but then you got to live as her and she you” or something like that. I like overtly feminine things, especially if they come in pink. I use a pink pen to take notes, I have worn Victoria’s Secret Love Spell, things like that. I always thought I would be an awesome lesbian. 

There’s a little voice in my head that has been getting louder and louder and louder and I finally listened to it. I told my wife that while I am not unhappy, I’m not exactly happy, either. It took a lot of talking out and over explaining, but eventually I got words out that I didn’t even realize were there: I’d like it if you called me Emma. I want to dress cute and be pretty and I feel extra super feminine right now and I just wanna be a girl ok?!?

Now my wife is an amazing supporting person, and she just says “yeah I figured actually I’ve kind of always known that”. She cried because she doesn’t want to say goodbye to Chris, and I didn’t (and still don’t) know if I want to either. 

That said, right now I want to be Emma, and it’s been euphoric, elation, bliss, pure unfiltered happy! I can’t believe I never saw the world like this! The sky is prettier, music sounds better, I can’t even begin to comprehend the world right now!

Then last night, wifey helped me put on some makeup. I was so frightened to look at myself in the mirror when she was done, and when I did, I broke down crying. For like five minutes all I did was fuck up my mascara and liner with the happiest tears I’ve ever cried in my life. Turn that up even higher when my wig got here!

I know that I’m Emma now. My three kids all reacted slightly differently but still awesome. My 12 year old son said “whatever wear pink and long hair it really doesn’t bother me why do you keep asking if it does? I don’t care.” (He is super socially awkward, so don’t take that as teenage sarcasm; he really doesn’t care that I’m Emma). My 11 year old said “as long as you’re happy, dad!” (Because I haven’t quite felt ok telling them I’d rather be a girl, they just see me dressing different). My 6 year old daughter thinks that my long hair is pretty. 

I can’t sort out everything that I’m feeling. I don’t even think I managed to get it all down correctly here! I don’t know if it’s the euphoria of letting Emma out of her tiny dark lockbox and being so completely her... which is the difficultly I have. 

I AM Emma. My name is Emma. My wife calls me Emma now. I don’t want to go back to being Chris, but I live in one of those dumb red states that can’t even elect the second most empowering and amazing candidate for senator I ever heard speak (President Obama being the first, and Congressman O’Rourke being who we Texans should have elected but don’t get me started). I don’t HATE being Chris, but at the same time, I don’t want to look back or go back. I love being me and I am Emma and I’m so happy now, why would I do that?

I guess, long story short... Hi, I’m Emma. I’m new here, I don’t know anyone like me, and I could use some friends and a really good therapist.

2018-11-24 21:35:09,a02hf1,5,1,"The last few years (I’m 20) I’ve noticed that I feel more and more like my gender(I suppose to everyone else it’s male) has been imposed on me more than anything. 

I’m not uncomfortable usually with masc pronouns, but I notice that in casual conversation when people refer to me as a “man”, I have this kind of hitch in my thinking, like, “oh, well, I guess...” while really never applying the same word to myself in my head. I don’t think I attach pronouns to myself when I’m thinking about myself, but I don’t think I really identify as male over anything else. It’s always felt like the least significant descriptor for who I am. 

I was talking to a friend about it and I told him that when I think about my own identity, I find myself wishing that I lived in a world where I didn’t have to choose a label for myself, where I was just able to be me. He responded by pointing out that according to this, in my ideal world, I’m not identifying as male. 

I’ve always thought of myself as a cis male despite feeling neutral/androgynous, because I haven’t ever felt any attachment to any other pronouns or labels. Maybe I have a bad focus on having a label, but it’s how I’ve thought about it in the past. 

I guess what I’m saying is that I think I very well might not identify as 100% male if I’m being totally honest with myself. “They/them” doesn’t pop out to me, but I suppose they don’t have to. I just don’t feel male some days. I don’t know if I feel like anything on other days. 

Does this sound like what some of you all experience with being gender fluid? Is this closer to being trans?

2018-11-28 02:39:57,a11xn6,6,1,"Hi,

I  once asked on AVEN (asexuality.org) how non-binary vs. cis vs. trans people dreamed and  what their bodies look like in their dreams and there seems to be some  differences, I'm curious about you guys. I am unsure as to whether I am  non-binary, agender or female.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been asking these questions on many other subreddits about gender identity and sexuality (and others) and got some interesting responses.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some questions, I will reply to them below:

1. Do you know you are dreaming during your dreams?
2. What   POV/perspective do you dream on? (first person, third person, other    persons POV, not present/ feels like watching a movie, alternate    between perspectives, etc...)
3. Do you feel any physical sensations in your dreams?
4. Are your dreams usually realistic or surreal?
5. Do you have ""super powers"" in your dreams? (ie flying, breathing underwater, invulnerability, etc...)
6. Is your dream body different from your real one? If so, how so?
7. Do    you have any dreams where you start out as yourself (or someone     else)  then swap into someone else's body and see the body you were     before  through their eyes, then swap back again, and so on, and do you     ever see  sometimes both people at the same time in 3rd person? Do  you    alternate  between controlling either?
8. Do you control your actions in your dreams? Do you have any degree of control over your dreams?
9. How fast does time go by in your dreams? Is it like waking life, faster, or like a movie?
10. What is your sexual orientation and gender identity? (I think this manifests itself in dreams)

My answers:

1. I always know I am dreaming.
2. Usually   3rd person (I see myself from outside of my body while still    controlling it), sometimes 1st person, occasionally alternate, rarely I    am not present and I am just an observer and I remember having at  least   once ""possessed"" another person's body and controlled them.
3. No, I don't feel anything.
4. They are quite surreal.
5. Yes,   I can fly/float in the air sometimes, breathe underwater and I am    usually invulnerable. I can also rewind and change the future sometimes    and change the scene when the dream takes a turn I don't like.
6. Usually   my body is the same, but I dream of myself often in the body of  other   women, in a male body, in the body of some videogame character, as  a   fictional character or actor, some animal, etc... I often alternate  in   the same dream.
7. Not that I remember. When I swap bodies my body usually disappears.
8. I can control my actions fully, and the environment to a degree.
9. In   my dreams time seems to go by faster than normal. My dreams are  usually  long and lots of things happen. I can fill 2+ pages just with  keywords  when I wake up (I keep a dream journal and when I wake up I  just write  down the keywords to help me remember)
10. Female, hetero-romantic asexual.

2018-11-29 19:30:02,a1ki8l,4,1,So I’ve been thinking about this for a bit. I recently came to the conclusion and accept that I’m gender fluid and I’m out to a few of my friends.

Recently I've noticed that my fluidity frightens me quite a bit. I often get this really intense fear about the idea that at some point in the future I'm going to feel different. I believe it stems from that fact that I really have no control over my constantly shifting identity.  


For instance, on a particularly fem day, I dread that in the coming days I might feel more masc. It almost feels like these parts of myself are constantly clashing with each other. I cope with it okay, but was wondering if anyone else has ever felt this way.

2018-11-30 05:17:19,a1ph36,2,1,"Hi, people! I've been questioning my gender for about the past month - although it's not the first time in my life I have it's the first time in years that I've allowed myself to (I made a longer post in r/nonbinary a few weeks ago that explains more on that). 

All I really know right now is I'm non-binary but I'm posting here because I'm thinking more and more that I might be genderfluid more specifically. In the beginning I didn't wanna id as genderfluid because the word wasn't ""clicking"" but the more I think about it, the more it does pretty much describe how I feel, I think? 

Basically I fluctuate between feeling ""mostly girl"" and ""mostly boy"" or somewhere in-between. I relate to both the terms ""demigirl"" and ""demiboy"" as in feeling partially girl+agender and partially boy+agender, and also have days where just feel agender altogether. But even my boy/girl sides don't feel fully connected to either gender, and I don't wanna be called man/woman, etc or any gendered words besides girl or boy depending on my mood (and other times I wanna be called none of these). 

I'm afab and still fem-aligned I think no matter what. Like I still like being feminine over masculine and even my boy side is feminine. I do still feel connected to certain things about being ""a girl"" in the sense of stuff like feminism, girl power, and sapphic love (I'm also Bi). So I don't hate my agab or want to completely reject it but I just feel like I've never fully connected with womanhood and have these other parts of me I need to express too like wanting to be a boy sometimes. I have days where I feel like I need to distance myself from being called ""girl"" because it's not my mood that day, even though I still wanna be one at other times. 

I also think I'm ok with any pronouns but I prefer they and she pronouns; they for any/all moods and she for my more girl moods or just apathetic moods. In boy mode, I prefer they/them to he/him but wouldn't care if I got called that either (especially if it means I've managed to pass as a boy). 

First of all: Does this sound like genderfluid? Or am I something else considering that I don't really have very ""masculine"" moods (as a girl, I'm often considered tomboy-ish but no one would call me masculine as a boy). Can you be genderfluid but still fem-aligned and such? Also I still have a prevailing feeling of being agender overall and don't really ever feel wholly like a woman/man? 

Or maybe I'm overthinking everything and am just a girl who is trying too hard to feel special? I still really like girly things and pink and such...

The second thing I wanna ask: If I am genderfluid, is it normal to feel frustrated by not being ""static"" enough in my identity? Like it makes you less of a whole individual? I don't wanna feel like I'm these two different people sharing the same body. I still wanna just be me. 

I think that's why I'm having trouble accepting being genderfluid. I'm in a weird spot where I feel like genderfluid describes me and is a helpful term and come close to accepting it and then I get frustrated again and start looking for more ""static"" terms to describe me. Like at first I was just gonna say ""non-binary"" or ""demigirl"" but I've realized how much I have this ""demiboy"" side too and need to distance myself from the word girl at those times... genderfluid kinda encompasses both I think?

Also: Would it be ok to use ""nonbinary""/""enby"" still but also use genderfluid as a more specific term? Like can I use both? I also really like the genderfluid flag over the nb one cuz it has pink on it but of course that's mainly unimportant lol. But I generally like how much easier it is to say nb/""enby"".

This is getting long but I feel like I have so much to figure out and this isn't even half of it. I'm mulling over stuff like my gender expression, hair, name, etc too.
