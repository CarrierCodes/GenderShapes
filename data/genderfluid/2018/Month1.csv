Firstly, I am bisexual (only recently sort of came out) so my understanding around everything LGBTQ+ is not the best as it could be. With that said, I was wondering if anyone at all could possibly take a look at my script and give me some feedback/advice - to make sure I have correctly portrayed someone who is genderfluid.

Or, even comment below on how you'd like a genderfluid character to be portrayed. Maybe even some personal information about how you live your life as genderfluid (if you are willing). Any help is welcome!

This script will become a short film where it will be screened (hopefully) in front of a crowd of people at my end of year show. I want this to be as good as I can make it while educating those in the audience who have no idea about LGBTQ+ or genderfluid community.

*Warning* If you happen to read the script, please be warned there is mention of violence/abuse and rape.

Thank you for any help - I will even probably credit help in my dissertation or film :)

P.s The script isn't finished and there is likely a lot of stuff to be changed and added, but I want to get it up on here ASAP to get any feedback before I make edits.

P.p.s The beginning of the script refers to the main character as 'she' because they begin as 'female' then I change to 'they' and 'their' when they have come out as genderfluid.

And the dialogue is shit.

I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost 3 years now, and he’s confessed that he feels more feminine some days and masculine other days.

We’ve talked about him transitioning, but I don’t think he wants to go through with it any time soon. (That may change though). I am trying really hard to be as supportive as possible, but I’m having a hard time not being upset (hurt/angry/confused/sad) whenever he brings this stuff up.
