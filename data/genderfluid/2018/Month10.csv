&amp;#x200B;

I posted about this about a month ago but wanted to remind folks as our first videos are starting to come online this month! I'm really excited and proud of those who have been taking part. :)

Here's the info: 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm starting a new collaborative YouTube project called ""Queer and Disabled.""  My goal for this project is to bring visibility and lift up the queer community discussing gender (non cis) and disability. Before you think, ""I'm not disabled,"" I ask that you read on and then decide, especially since we are looking for more volunteers from all over the globe and all walks of life. The project is geared anyone 18+ who sits outside the cis gender box, like transgender men &amp; transgender women, intersex, gender fluid, gender queer, androgyne, bigender, agender and non binary (not a complete list, brain fog is real, lol)...you get the idea (except otherkin),  who also deal with mental, learning, hearing, visual, intellectual, &amp;/or physical disabilities or chronic illnesses, whether visible or invisible.

Below is our video introducing the project (it's our first so please be kind, it takes a little time to get used to speaking to YouTubers lol). Note: I understand many don't consider themselves ""disabled enough"" to be considered ""disabled"" but that's part of the project as well. Trying to throw off the stigma behind various disabilities to show even if we do deal with different issues when it comes to our gender identity, both visible and invisible disabilities are valid.

&amp;#x200B;

If you have any questions or you are interested in participating, please email the project at [daqueer@outlook.com](mailto:daqueer@outlook.com)

I got back into therapy to try figuring all this out and had my first session yesterday, and one thing that came up really was like a needle into my questions and insecurities and anxieties since I started this process. One of my main concerns in this process has been how to explain things to my wife. When I imagine the conversation and explaining that I don't want to transition, I just want to find ways to express my feminine side.

My therapist asked me why I'm hung up on that term and that distinction, and I identified that there's a lot of stigma around crossdressing, and that I associate it with dressing for sexual reasons, which he said isn't necessarily true in his experience working with people who crossdress. 

It's been sticking in my head all day, and it's kicked up a lot of doubt and discomfort (which I already had plenty of to start with). I think a lot of it has to do with thinking that this part of my identity was just a fetish for most of my life, and if I can't separate it from crossdressing, which also (in my mind) is a fetish thing, then maybe it really is just a kink, maybe I'm just a cis guy with a weird fantasy life after all. 

And then I had a little epiphany that if I'm genderfluid/nonbinary, how can it be ""crossdressing""? But if I still present &amp; identify as male socially, then how can it not? Am I just creating a female persona to wear around the house? 

Basically, I'm curious if other genderfluid people have dealt with this anxiety, if/how you make a distinction, or if this is a hangup that I need to get over. Or if you think I'm just a cis dude with a kink.

2018-10-04 01:43:36,9l7jp6,0,1,"For about 12 years until just this week, I identified as a (cis) lesbian, but felt compelled to accept that I'm not totally cis. I have usually presented as a lot more femme than butch, worn feminine clothing and jewelry, and often get mistaken for a straight woman even by members of the LGBTQ+ community. That's how I've felt most comfortable appearing most of the time. When I've worn a more masculine outfit or let too much body hair grow, I've felt less comfortable with myself--most of the time. 

I now realize that some of this discomfort around masculine expression is internalized stigma on top of emphasizing the times when I've felt feminine. I've had memories come up these days of the sense of being classified strictly as a girl as a child and conforming to a female identity throughout my life, even after coming out as a lesbian. I've often pushed down those parts of me that didn't align with that female identity.

Occasionally, such as this week, I'll feel masculine. During these times, I wish I looked like a guy and didn't go by a feminine name or pronouns. I've seriously questioned whether I was trans at times. I don't feel that I am, at least not a trans man, as I have no persistent dysphoria, though I do have some at times. It's like I have Schrödinger's gender, as another user put it. Talking about this side of me really seems to bring it out. I'm really curious as to how it would be to have a penis and am inclined to try out a packing one like a lot of trans guys wear.

Then, there's my sexuality. I like feminine people and women and not men. That, and especially when I engage in sexual activities, I find myself wishing I had a penis. I mentioned to my trans ex-girlfriend that I wished we could switch parts during sex when we were together. My orientation has had this aspect to it pretty much since puberty. It's pretty consistent, even when I feel feminine. Yet, even though I like to imagine I had a penis, I don't think I'd want to be a guy or masculine person full time. I wish I could switch parts at will sometimes. That's my dream. My understanding is that this is not a typical cis lesbian experience. And sometimes, I wish I could just be a woman or feminine person with a penis, and not just for sexual purposes. I wish it was okay in society to be like that.

2018-10-04 07:04:22,9l9m8i,1,1,"So I've been living my life fairly open as genderfluid for the last year or so, and though there has been some issues that have come up because of it, I have zero regrets.

One thing that has quite pleasantly surprised me as that a friendship with an awesome straight cis woman has grown into something more.  We currently define our relationship status as friends with benefits.  Anyway, we've worked up to having sex at least a few times a week.  It is quite good and enjoyable, but I've found that we have a more or less inverted the roles on who can orgasm the most.  She orgasms most every time, whereas it has been very difficult for me to do so.  In fact, I have only orgasmed once, and it was from a very good hand job where I was able to completely relax and enjoy myself.

I'm 21, in college, have really awesome supportive friends, and rich unsupportive parents. I came out to them last December and they think that I'm just a crossdresser who needs Jesus. 

Due to my parents paying for my college and fearing that they would kick me out, I haven't started transition. They have said if I don't respect them and follow their rules they would. I haven't been the most obedient child. I've lied and almost gotten kicked out of college due to my depression and bad grades. 

So the thing that has made me question and think I might be genderfluid is that I have never been uncomfortable with myself looking male but I haven't ever connected with masculinity in a deep way. I definitely prefer she/her pronouns. There are days where my dysphoria is more pronounced, but there are days and in most settings where are times I'm perfectly comfortable being seen as male.

When I was a teen, I was a tomboy, through and through. Adults and fellow students alike referred to me as a boy, and it never bothered me too much. I like being the ""girl"" who could do ""boy"" things. 
I grew up on a farm, so the line between gender was blurred quite a bit for me. I never learned that ""driving a tractor and bailing hay"" was masculine. 

But here is my issue.

Today, in my early 30's, I feel pretty fluid in my head- I feel mostly comfortable passing as a woman, but I also feel at odds with presentation. Like, I enjoy being a woman, but I hate the gender standards, and I reject them, as most of us do.

But as someone who doesnt want to change my body, who is okay, and infact happy with the feminine aspects of my body, am I ""allowed"" to id as non-binary/genderqueer?

So, I am 28, and have spent most of my life as a straight cis man, and only recently (last year or so, maybe two) realized that I’m bisexual, and even more recently, have been taking a hard look at my gender. My spouse recently came out as nonbinary, so I’ve been thinking a lot about that, but I’ve never felt dysphoria around my gender and never felt euphoria about being referred to by other pronouns, so I don’t think NB really fits me. After some conversations my spouse suggested I look up gender fluid and it seems maybe to fit better but I’m still feeling uncertain. 

I think I started having moments a few years ago where (only when I wasn’t being watched) I would “try on” behaviors that I considered to be feminine or flamboyant (like walking with my hips or letting my hands dangle down at the wrists, etc.), but never really explored anything more than that. Then recently, I found myself feeling like I wanted to be on the receiving end of PIV sex, and started fantasizing about it. Very recently (like the last few days/weeks?) I’ve found that to be more consistent, and a few days ago (after probably weeks of wanting to buy not finding the right time) I tried putting on makeup for the first time (not counting a theater performance I was in in high school), and felt pretty good with it on. Other than that I’ve also been experimenting with taking pictures of myself that make it appear that I have female anatomy (is that PC?). I also have been playing with my walk some, and noticed myself feeling a desire for people to perceive me as a woman, but she/her pronouns still don’t feel right, and part of me still feels like I’m just playing with it and playing the part rather than it being somehow my truer deeper self. 

I don’t really know what the question is, I guess it’s mostly like “is that experience consistent with being genderfluid?” Would love to hear your thoughts.

Essentially over the summer, about july ish, I started taking a low dose of fenugreek daily (my hormones are all sorts of wacky and I decided to try it to see if it helps, a lot of cis females take it when pregnant to help with hormone stuff and from what i've seen it's also in some protein powders my cis brother uses and those helped him bulk up) and it's has some interesting effects?

1. My voice has lowered, not like in a drastic way, it sounds more relaxed and andro which I love

2018-10-17 20:01:15,9p236o,0,1,"I know I like to say that labels don't really matter to me all that much, but it's also starting to hit me that I'm in my last year of undergrad. I know college seems like, feels like, one of the better places to grow into oneself, but that doesn't change some things. I still have to deal with this university being in a small town, though the university itself is very accepting. I also would have to deal with my family and community back in my hometown. So I really want to know for sure with 100% confidence before I change anything, even though I know it isn't likely.

I'm not even really sure what to say about myself. I don't think I've ever really identified deep down as female. I basically grew up a boy just because my parents gave up on me being a ""girly girl"". I didn't really become more feminine until I hit puberty and figured that was what was expected of me. I remember freaking the fuck out over my first period because I was told that my body was ready to make children and that I was becoming a woman.

The current me gave up on femininity almost immediately, I doubt it was even there at all, more of me just faking it. All I really did after that was grow out my hair and wear dresses and skirts more often. As I grew, my height stopped, my body curved, and my chest grew. I've hated it ever since. My body in general. I hate my curves and chest because I can't wear the clothes I like. Even when I was at my ""optimal weight"" I still hated it. I guess I've grown to tolerate it because I have to live in it, but that doesn't make it enjoyable. I say that I'm okay with things like my hair, that I'm not willing to give them up, but at the same time not being happy looking like this.

I've tried making subtle changes to how I dress. I've always ever worn variations on jeans and a t-shirt. I've started wearing boxers and briefs when I can, though it makes the feeling even more obvious that something down there feels missing. When it comes to dress clothes (formal and business casual) I primarily wear something more andro because I'm done with dresses (for the most part) and I don't feel comfortable trying a suit or tux just yet (I really want to). I dread the day I have to start wearing blouses or dresses/skirts because I can no longer pass t-shirts or long sleeves as dress tops, and my chest prevents me from wearing button-ups. My body doesn't allow me to wear what I see as myself without it coming off in a way I don't want it to. But I'm also afraid of people asking questions because of the way I'm dressed.

I guess my biggest point of confusion lies between who I really am and who I'm expected to be. I grew up in a really religious community where you're only allowed to be male and masculine, or female and feminine, no mix-and-match. So I also have to wonder if I'm just a woman who really wants to be more masculine and do what I want with my life, no more of this ""father always has to protect you and provide for you, you're never allowed to leave the hometown, just stay and marry a man and make babies"". Which, to be honest, I really want. So friggin badly. But I also have other things to consider. Like how I've felt this past year, and really over my lifetime, as described above. I guess I just feel like I'm trying to fool myself into thinking I'm a man when I really want to be more masculine. I've always been told that women like certain things and men like others etc. But since I got to university and grew the fuck up, I discovered it's perfectly okay to like whatever the fuck you want. I could be masculine and love cozy fuzzy stuff.

But I've gotten to the point where I can watch videos of people transitioning, I watch men becomes themselves and it makes me happy, and it also scares me that I would have to go through that. I watch women become themselves and can't stop wondering why they'd give that up, give up what I want for myself.

I can picture 2 versions of myself in the future, a man and a woman, and I'd much rather be him.

I'd love to talk this out to someone, but the counseling center at my university is under the impression that psychology majors like me can't have any problems and that we just want attention or know too much. And the people I know who are trans or anything but cis can't seem to see me anything but straight and cis.

I've also been considering if maybe I'm just not on the binary because my feelings seem to fluctuate sometimes in intensity. Like sometimes I do feel okay being female. Other times I hate myself and being female. Most times I just exist somewhere in-between.

I think if I would ever come out my parents would kill me but in some ways I think this would be good for the environment maybe some other partners would agree with me that pushing your queer kid of the stairs would be a good idea.

Sometimes I get harassed at work for being so undecided but maybe I shout get my shit together and think like a normal not mentally challenged person.

After all I think I'm a man and all you queers need immediate medical attention because 20 genders doesn't exist and you have to be regarded to think this way.

2018-10-23 18:12:39,9qrkkl,7,1,"I'm so confused, and I apologize in advance.   

Currently, and for the last three months, I figured myself as non binary, demigender(woman). However I'm feeling myself change and I'm not sure why.   
AMAB, but do not want anything to do with male/masculine stuff. I'm on hrt to feminize, I try and hide masculine traits, and just be comfortable in my skin.   

However I know I'm not a woman. I don't feel like one, I don't want to be one, I don't want to be labeled as one... But my gender shifts very closely to that of one, so I felt demigender was pretty accurate. I'm very much andro/middle/none, and sometimes femme. It changes. Sometimes in the same day. Sometimes I'll be one for a few days. It hasn't caused too many issues because my style is that of comfy clothes and not really femme stuff like dresses, so I've been able to be comfortable.    

But something is not right and I don't know what. I'm beginning to doubt myself a lot. I'm getting a tiny bit dysphoric about thinking of where my breasts will grow to, yet a few hours later or the next day I'm happy and excited to see where they go. I'm happy about my body and then I'm hesitant.    

My shifts between femme and neutral are starting to become more noticeable and it feels like they are different things, instead of a bit of the two.     

Again, sorry. My brain is just a mess and I'm trying to think things through, but after reading this over it doesn't seem like I've thought much through at all.      

I guess I just don't know where I stand or what. Does *anyone* have experiences similar to this? I'm just so confused on how to feel about how I feel right now.     
I know genderflux is a term, but I don't really understand the percentages explanation so I don't know...

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to start by saying that i love my dog and would never do anything to harm her, she is my princess and i truly love her, she is my best friend and has been since i rescued her just over four months ago. 

so, this all started a week ago when i decided to remove her penis. ive been contemplating doing this for a while now through the traditional method of visiting the doctor for surgical procedures but i found some articles online of how to do it safely at home and being pretty broke and not really able to afford the surgical option, it was our only real choice. 

now let me back up as to why i decided to do this. my dog (which is a beautiful yorkshire terrior) always seems to gravitate toward female dog toys, treats etc. and just has an overall female personality and i think she even looks more like a female dog more than anything (i refuse to use the word bitch to refer to any living being i just feel like its so disrespectful) anyway i used a similar technique as people do when they remove dogs tails, which is basically restricting blood flow then removal. foward to today and shes doing really well, theres still a little blood but it seems to be healing well overall but my problem is my family. theyre absolute nut job conservatives, i mean theyre not the type to vote but they hold  those sort of ideals and theyre really freaking out and threatening to get my princess removed from me and are constantly calling me and saying im crazy.

2018-10-24 20:44:05,9r3izg,6,1,"Am I genderfluid? - That's the question I asked myself four months ago. Looking back, the answer was a clear yes, but I had my head so far up my own ass that the idea never occurred to me. I had convinced myself that I was perfectly cis, and there was no way in hell that I could be anything else. I was wrong.

It started out when I was twelve, with a dream funnily enough. In the dream, I was at my grandmother's shop (A women's clothes shop) and I was playing hide and see with my cousins. As I hid in the changing room, I noticed a pretty dress, and for some reason, I felt the urge to put it on. I did, and suddenly transformed into this beautiful woman. I felt sexy, confident, and amazing. I woke up two seconds later. Pandora's box was opened. 

At the time I didn't think much of it. It was a dream after all, everyone knows dreams are weird right? But it kept replaying in my head. Looping time after time, how amazing and freeing it felt, and I started to get curious. (Even now I still remember that dream vividly) 

The feeling of wanting to be pretty lead me to crossdress for the first time, and a whole new world suddenly opened up. I looked and felt pretty, and I wanted to do it more and more often. Shortly after I noticed a magazine that had been left lying around, and in the magazine a woman was modelling a beautiful swimsuit. I found myself wanting more than anything else to be her. To be able to dress up exactly like her, look like her, and pose like her. So I started to to research. And that's when the trouble began. 

In theory it sounded perfect, I would transition, and life would be dandy. But a part of twelve year old me asked myself ""But I like being a guy? Don't I?"" And just like that doubts poured in. I became afraid, terrified I was forcing myself into something that I would regret. I quickly decided to stay a guy buy crossdress, because that's totally ok right? It totally won't come back to bite me in the ass.

So I kept on crossdressing in secret. It was fun. I eventually moved on to blouses and heels, and practiced walking so that I could move around without breaking my ankles. I even started to get into makeup and started to teach myself how to apply eyeshadow. Then I made a mistake. I grew in confidence, and naively modeled one of my sister's dresses to my brother. That same night he told our mother, and the questioning look and confused sound she made broke my heart. There and then I swore I would never crossdress again. 

Time passed, and I figured I was over it. At this point I was sixteen, and struggling with depression (unrelated circumstances). After a long battle, I was slowly getting better, and in the midst of it I started to wonder about crossdressing again. I wanted to feel pretty once more, but I didn't want to steal my sister's clothes for fear of getting caught (plus puberty hit me like a truck while my sister is petite). So I started to search online, and one day I made a friend. She seemed sweet, and after we became good friend she told me she was transgender and planning to transition. This blew my mind. I had so many questions, but didn't want to bother her, and deep down a part of me wondered whether I was actually jealous of her, but I kept that hidden deep down. 

As I got to know her better the idea of transitioning no longer seemed as taboo, but I still had that echo of my mother's words, and didn't explore further. Instead I started to look up gender bending fiction. This served to heighten what I now realise was dysphoria, but I thought I found the key. By relieving myself sexually I was able to stop feeling bad! What a great idea!

This cycle would continue to haunt me for five long years. Each time I would get the feeling of dysphoria, I would take care of business, and feel better after. It didn't matter that it would come back later, all that mattered was that I was ok then. 

But like every addict, I could never reach that high. As I found myself unable to stop the dysphoria through my normal methods I kept on going more and more extreme, until I reached a point where I was becoming in danger of losing myself as a person outside sexual gratification. That point was 9 months ago. 

After once session where I came down fairly quickly from the high I looked at myself, and was disgusted. I was wasting my life, and was acting pathetically. I quit cold turkey, and it sucked. A lot. After some relapses I decided it was time to end the ""feitsh"" once and for all and forced myself to stop consuming any and all media related to genderbending. 

Things were looking up. I was past the ""reset"" period for any sort of sexual addiction conditioning, and had started to come out of my shell. Then the dream happened. 

(Note I tend to suffer dysphoria when I am stressed out)

During my examination period, right before a very tough exam, I had a dream. In the dream, I had decided to transition. My mother was next to me, supporting me all the way, and she was telling me she was proud to have me as her daughter. I was ecstatic. A year passed, and I was now looking incredibly feminine. I had breasts, and curves and looked every part the woman that I had aimed to be. Then out of nowhere, it suddenly felt wrong. I didn't want to go back to being a guy, but at the same time being female didn't fit perfectly. I wanted to be both at the same time for lack of a better word. 

I woke up in a cold sweat and realised that something was different. This wasn't going to pass. After doing some digging, I learnt of this subreddit and the concept of genderdfluidity. I then logged onto reddit, and made my first post here.   

Since then things have changed for me. After having an open talk with myself I have improved in many aspects, however I have slid back into those bad habits on a few occasions (namely when I find myself questioning my gender identity). 

Right now the big argument I am having with myself is whether I want to transition or not, but that is a post for another time.

2018-10-25 13:43:58,9raf4b,3,1,"Hi.
Im a person who use most of my time contemplating different antropological, political and sosial issues. I stumbled apon a tread arguing the consept of gender. No to be clear before i ask my question, its just out of curiosety to hear the community opinion on a subject that two sides care deeply about in different directions. No i beleve that the world exists of mostly people not realy xaring what others call them self. But the issue, of at least what i have read and heard, seems to be that the word gender is used in different ways. I also understand that its a issue with rights like dressing rooms toilets and so on, but lets leav that aside for the moment, becaus its sutch a hard subject to discuss, due to both sides having valid points, maby one day we will have evolved past shame and can deal with this as a normality, but untill than, ceep fighting that battle. What i want to discuss is more triveal, the word gender it self. Ok, so the word in origin actualy has a broad and not so definable meaning, even going beond female male ore something in betwin ore past. Than the word got into the english language where it went on to be a description of sex (meaning the physical genetalia we are born with male, female and hermaphrodite) than it seems to me that in resent time, with more openess in parts of sosiety its beeng presented as meening something else, a description of a feeling (of sort) than the part of sosiety that do not wish to partake in this new found openess dissagree, with the ""right"" of the word already having a sosial lingustic meening witch is allready ""agreed"" apon and understod. So thats the conflict. Now it seems to me to be a impossible task changing the minds of those with there mind allready made up in this regard, and for me, a outsider in this matter, ""as I said I dont care if you have a vagina, feel like a man ore if you are gay ore straight and want to use the shower next to me ore be my friend, as i find gender and sex to be irellevant in any normal sosial settings."" But for me it seems counter constuctive to partake in this arguement, as any argument should have a forseable solution ore conclution, now it would ve reasonable to assume (like I do) that the conclution is that the two sides dissagree and do not agree to do so, and have their mind set on a screaming battle. Historicly the gay comunety whent through a fase that can be compared, simplefying it a little but bare with me. A gay man was called a faggot, devaluing his life into that of kindeling, wich is the true meaning of the word, the gay community have in different stages changed the defenition in a lingual sence to the point where its about to become useless to presue for those who apose, altho ppl try. And the word faggot to most ppl is now a frase more than a defenition of sexual orientation (not for all ppl, but I can see this is the way its headed) now the way they changed the meaning was and is by defining them self in a different mather, like queer. Now to win the part of the arguement conserning the word it self, would it not be more practical to create a word that have the defeniton you use to define gender? And let the narominded ppl have their word! I meen, if someone created a wird with a defenition that can not be argued. And that leves more room for this comunity to aprotche the aspects of your sosial challenges, witch in return will be of more value to your ultimate goals. I will take the liberty of suggesting ""Sensu"" wich is taken from the Latin word for feeling, nobody can argue somene elses feelings, so it would be fitting. So instead of gender fluide its sensu fluide, ore any verity anyone wishes. This way you at least get the opertunety to define your self without anyone having the opetunety to say thats not true. And ultematly win the gender arguement. 

Hopes no one takes offence, if you do, im sorry for not understanding the issue, it can be hard to understand all aspects of something from the outside, and this is done with the best intent.

Describing his/her quasi-dysphoriness.    
Sharing a photo.   
 

Really, really nervous to do this as it's my very first post here.  But I wanted to say hi and.... well... I don’t know. I guess this is me hoping to join the community and make some friends.

I’m not typical as a trans person (I'm a trans person??? eeek! I've never said that), in that I only started questioning, educating myself about three years ago in my late 40s. In fact, I'm still wondering if I *even am* trans or just.... I don’t know.  Just an odd bird. 

I don’t feel like a woman but I really enjoy expressing a feminine side. I like how presenting as a woman allows me the means to explore feminine behaviors, feelings, etc without the cognitive dissonance of seeing a man in a reflection or being seen as a man by others.

And although born with typical male anatomy, I don’t completely feel like a man. I never really have. In fact, throughout my teens, into my twenties and through two more decades I periodically would wonder, ""am I a man yet?""  Weird, huh.

As far as dysphoria goes... I honestly don't know if I have it. I mean, I don't have a disdain for my male dangly bits.  I like my five-day whiskers... I think I look kinda cool with my week long beard.  But, the times that I have presented as female, changing back is really... I don't know, I wouldn't say depressing but... it hurts. I don't like it. I want to stay that way a little longer. I heard the Gender Rebels podcast girls call it ""Cinderella Midnight"".  But once I'm back in boy-mode, I'm ok.  So, I don't know... I don't think I have dysphoria.  

Soooo I'm adding a photo and this is what I look like.... sort of.  You know, if you count filters, smoothing some lines here and there, thinning my eyebrows, slapping on a wig, doing some digital FFS by narrowing my face shape, removing some jawline, adding cheeks, nose contouring as well as big time makeup.  

So besides that... **totally** me! LOL!  You know.... Just your basic look of a genderfluid, enby,  who sometimes likes to femme it up.

Gender fluidity and the concept of being non-binary has fascinated me for a while. Mainly because I have found it difficult to understand, and partly because I want to understand.

I'm always on the side of people following the path that makes them comfortable, with the usual caveat of it not causing harm to others, so I hope I'm not offending anyone with my upcoming thoughts and questions. Having given this issue a lot of thought I'd like to ask the following:

1) Why and how does the spectrum of gender, differ from the spectrum of character/traits/experience of being a male or female?

2) By identifying as gender fluid, are you not by default defining what it is to be male or female, and therefore limiting the spectrum of male/female experience?

3) Would/could it be empowering to broaden the perception and expectation of what it means to be biologically male or female, rather than distancing yourself from what you feel society expects of those genders? Would your disassociation from those genders be lessened if a broader spectrum of each of those was more readily visible and accepted in society?

2018-10-31 07:21:51,9swjdj,2,1,"So I'm an 18yo male and my girlfriend is a 20yo female by birth, and gender fluid (also non-binary), and when she told me I was cool about it because I really like her. But it's been causing some problems, not when it's just the two of us but when we're hanging around my friends. 

She'll joke around that I'm gay if we kiss and bring it up at the weirdest of times, or insist that on certain days she's not my girlfriend if the word is brought up (by the way I asked her what she was today so the word girl is accurate). Normally I wouldn't give two shits, but it creates an awkward silence around the room, and I hate having to be the one to explain the situation after the fact to my friends what the ""deal"" is between us. It's gotten to the point where I try to keep my distance from my friends when I'm with her (some of my friends have strong opinions about gender)

I wanna try and try to talk to her about it, but when the subject gets brought up she gets kinda defensive, so I don't know how to bring it up to her. 

Any advice? I figured you people would know, also any other advice on how to act? I might be a little iffy on the gender subject but for my girl I want to make sure I get all my facts straight.

tl;dr How can my SO and I talk about gender?
