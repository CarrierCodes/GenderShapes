2018-12-02 18:30:04,a2fql1,5,0,"I truly don't want my questions to come off as ignorantly offensive.  I just have no basis for frame of reference. 

Comparably, when society was fighting for equal gay marriage right, I had already had several gay friends, so I already had an idea if concepts such as they didn't just one day choose to be gay, nobody can force them to be straight, and trying to do so has proven in the past to be incredibly damaging. I saw that older generations had to hide it, while newer generations were becoming more accepting.

In addition, when the transgender movement was getting more media attention, I saw examples of individuals who knew from an early age that their inside gender identity didn't match their assigned gender at birth.  I saw again that the older generations had to hide it, while newer generations were becoming more accepting. 

Gender fluid is new to me.  

1. Has there always been a subset of individuals experiencing gender fluidity that they had to hide, such as to just go with the flow in society? 

2. Is it likely to always stick around for the rest of her life, such as with gay and trans, they don't outgrow it, it just always sticks around? 

3. How do you navigate the reality that society simply doesn't want to keep up with one individual feeling/presenting masculine or feminine one day to the next?  I promise I don't want to say this offensively but what I know about society in general is that people often just want a fixed explanation and some might be willing to say ""ok i used to know this person as a woman but now he's a man so I'll get used to saying him and he"" but if someone is changing their identity on a whim then most of society is going to get frustrated with expecting to keep up or being blamed for using the wrong pronoun on any given day.  I mean I know it doesn't even compare but I know people say to me ""ugh I can never keep up with whether you and your ex are on or off!"" And I just think ""well you don't have to keep up, I'm just telling you that we're not together now"" or even ""ugh I can never keep up with whether you like drinking or not!"" well occasionally I do but usually not.  But they still get really frustrated that some detail they think should be fixed is still continually changing and unpredictable.  How do I help my daughter accept that society will want some fixed idea of her, such as as a girl,  even on days she doesn't feel like a girl? 

4. Is it damaging to her psyche to suggest just keeping it to herself for the most part? She said so far she only tells her inner circle which way she is feeling from one day to the next which I think is a healthy approach but if there are damaging aspects to hiding it then of course I want to know how to help navigate in a way that is the least damaging to her.

2018-12-02 21:00:03,a2h86h,2,2,"I've already come out to a few of them as bisexual, but I'm starting to think they've completely forgotten about that. I've been wanting to start a conversation about gender, and possibly coming out to them as genderqueer. I know that they'd all be very accepting, especially considering almost none of them are straight and a handful aren't cis either. It just seems like before they came out, the few I knew back then, they were kind of similar to me in some aspects of personality - just quiet, reserved people who never talked much. And when they came out, it's like the dam burst and their real personalities came out of the closet with them. Over the years that we've all been friends, I know and they know that I've grown a lot as a person, getting more comfortable being around them and talking to them. I know I still come off as quiet and reserved though.

But I keep noticing that they'll all hangout together and go places together, get drunk together, go to pride and drag shows together, etc, but never invite me to join. I usually have to be the one to initiate events that include me, or push my way into an event or hangout. Last night, a few of us went out for a late dinner, just hanging out and being friends and all. The conversation got to the topic of love lives and sex lives. It was something the me from 5 years ago would've run out the door for, and it seems like they still see me as that person. I just want to be able to hangout and laugh and joke with them without them thinking they have to censor the conversation. As we left the place, they were all apologizing to me for the conversation, as well as making plans to hangout later to continue the conversation. I talked to another friend about this later that night (she graduated last year and moved away), and she said that most people view me as the ""innocent, quiet friend"", the ""too pure for this world"" friend.

I kind of understand if they think I'm uncomfortable with the conversation because I rarely contribute to the more love and sex life topics, but I honestly don't have anything to contribute because I've felt so uncomfortable with myself for years, only to discover that I'm uncomfortable because I'm not straight or cis. And I feel like sometimes they exclude me from these hangouts and conversation because they think of me as too innocent, too pure, too straight/cis, to feel comfortable with the conversation. But I also shouldn't have to come out to everyone as a sort of pass to become closer friends. And part of that is on me for being so reserved, but I guess I've been so reserved all my life out of fear of being myself.

I love my friends, and I want them to know the real me, and I want to be able to get closer to them. But I don't know how to do that when they can't see me as anything but innocent and pure. And I'm afraid that if I do come out to them, it'll be seen as me trying to get into a fad and faking it all. They already try to not assume gender or sexuality when new people join our friend group, but I feel like I was an exception to that rule and seen as nothing but straight/cis.

2018-12-03 06:45:11,a2m4y8,7,1,"I’m afab and have enough of a ”female” chest for it to give me dysphoria when I feel masculine and want to present male, but then most times during sex I do enjoy the tiddy being touched very much (along with the rest of my body, altho sometimes dysphoric about certain parts of the bottom half but sometimes not), it makes me very confused. 

Somehow I wish I could have a chest that LOOKS masculine but FEELS the way it does now, with sensitivity to the nipples and at least some volume (could be muscle + fat in a typically male chest?) but I don’t know if it’s achievable and I’m afraid how top surgery would affect the feeling (depending on what kind of surgery they would go with would in worst case scenario reduce feeling to almost none, from what I’ve heard). And I wonder if testosterone can make certain parts of your body less sensitive? Or like centre the feeling to down there during sex?

And I still haven’t figured out what I am. Transmasculine? Gender fluid? Nonbinary? Bigender? Socially I say I’m a gender nonconforming (and/or nonbinary) transman, I’ve used a masc coded name and he/they pronouns for a few months. I started getting dysphoric about things like lack of some bottom parts, voice, chest back in 2016, before that I had unexplained anxiety since I became a teenager. I’m 26 now. I was deep in the closet both with gender and sexuality. I’m pan but statistically more into a certain kind of masculine ppl, sometimes I relate heavily to the male gay community (which has it’s own problematics).

I have my femme side when presenting, but I see it not that much related to gender but general expression of self. More along the lines of men dressing cute and doing makeup to look good, or doing drag, not to really present a female identity. And I do want to look &amp; feel flat chested in EVERY other situation but sex. It’s really strange... I mean I wish I could go topless to the beach, not bind but still be flat etc, but somehow I don’t always feel like this in sexual situations?

I’m starting to think this is some next level splitting between body and mind shit, or trying to hang on to aspects of my ”lost” femininity... I have borderline personality disorder and feel like I haven’t had a coherent identity or personality all my life (I didn’t question my gender before 2015, my ”egg” cracked when I came into touch with a trans guy through work). 

But at the same time, I don’t doubt being transgender because I definitely don’t feel like a woman, or female, in any other way than when it comes to sex. I (still) enjoy very stereotypical ”female” ways of being pleased. (And I’m pretty much a bottom). I’ve tried other things (like strapping on) but since I’m ”wired” this way some things just feel natural...while others feel good as a fantasy but don’t work irl. 

TL;DR; I mostly want to feel &amp; look flat, I get annoyed by my chest sometimes if I’m not binding, the feeling of it sensory wise and sometimes more dysphoric, and try to ”mould” it with my hands to see what it would look like as flat, fantasize about it even, but then during sex (including masturbation..) it becomes a very central part that I want to have touched, and I fear I would miss it if I were to alter my body through medical transitioning. 

So idk ;__; I also want to have long hair, not that keen about body hair, and want to go for a low-key goth androgynous style, some days makeup and some days not. I know I can do and be like anything, as nonbinary/gnc, but still these things confuse me as I don’t know whether to settle or to go for changes. Not deciding to transition with hormones and top surgery feels like it’s invalidating my masculine side, and would make it impossible to correct my papers, name etc. Where I live, one needs to have gone through the evaluation process, get the ”binary” transgender diagnosis and be on hormones for 1 y or otherwise sterile to correct the identity information.

I'm afab. I started identifying as nonbinary a few months ago. I'm only out to my boyfriend who panicked a little the first week but has calmed down. I'm not interested in medical transition and still present femininely most of the time. When I'm androgynous, I'd rather give off the illusion that my body has changed than physically go through hormones or surgery to change it. 

I'm starting to wonder if I'm genderfluid. If I am, I'm definitely female and nonbinary, not male. 

My physical dysphoria is either nonexistent or just mild and not typical. If I had it my way I'd be able to change my body however I wanted day by day. 

Monday, a feminine body, Tuesday a flat chest, Wednesday boobs but no vagina.

Having the body I have doesn't cause me much distress though. My body dissatisfaction increases around my period but almost all of it is focused on my stomach which is not a gender thing.

To me this sounds very similar to genderfluidity, but how do I know it's not just nonbinary dysphoria being weird? Is this how being gender fluid works?

I've always liked male clothes. Even when I thought I was a girl. Especially very oversized shirts. But I also like feminine clothes.

My aesthetic fluxuates between ""lazy feminine"" to ""prepubescent boy"" to ""actually tried feminine"" to ""lazy Andro""

2018-12-06 18:15:46,a3qk8o,1,1,"Hi, my name is JubJub and I just wanted to introduce myself and discuss my experiences/thoughts/stuff while getting your thoughts/experiences/stuff on being gender fluid. I am AMAB but identity as gender fluid going between male/female/agender.

tldr will be at the bottom.

So basic background info, history of mental health issues, depression in remission due to meds, anxiety getting better due to new meds and CBT

So now that's out the way. After the change of meds and starting CBT I started exploring my gender identity again now that I was jumping at my own shadow due to bad meds. 

So in the past I have had days that I would get easier frustrated, annoyed and tetchy for no apparent reason (would happen maybe once or twice a week), and I being encouraged to be introspective I thought about why this would be happening. Didn't work at first.

Then I did something I did before the mad meds and get rid of the body hair on my upper half. And oh did it give me gender euphoria, my partner even commented on my improved mood. Had none of the days I mentioned above for a week, and then, like the tide, the hair starts growing back in earnest and I get hit by a really bad day.

At the end on of the day I think about what could have caused it. And then it clicks into place, I was not comfortable in my body as it was and I hated people calling me by my male name at work. So I do a little research and talked to partner and come up with the idea that it could be gender dysphoria?

After this I made a post on Facebook coming out to my friends as a whole that I am gender fluid, not family, they are mildly transphobic and telling them currently is a nope. I go into details about that I'm open  to friends but not the public due to the industry I work in and the likelihood I would run into a regular customer and so on. This went really well with people being supportive. 

Then come to last Wednesday at work, hating it and having one of those days. Then I get a really bad intrusive thought, I have had intrusive thoughts before but nothing this intense or graphic and this one gender based. This scared me, while I would never and have never acted upon intrusive thoughts, that it was that intense, graphic or specific before. Thankfully I had a meeting with a mental health nurse the next day.

So from that they have referred me on to a psychiatrist who deals with this kind of thing for my area, though I am still waiting for a call to arrange an appointment. And this gets down to the crux of it all, what do I want? I know what I want(ish). I want to be able to express my gender identity in public/at work without discrimination/prejudice/hate or judgement by other people, I assume this is want most if not all people want. But that isn't something I can change. So changing myself, I want to know what options I have as gender fluid person in the UK dealing with the NHS?

tldr; I'm an AMAB gender fluid individual going between male/female/agender and I'm looking for advice about options available for where I am?

This went really well with people being supportive. \n\nThen come to last Wednesday at work, hating it and having one of those days. Then I get a really bad intrusive thought, I have had intrusive thoughts before but nothing this intense or graphic and this one gender based. This scared me, while I would never and have never acted upon intrusive thoughts, that it was that intense, graphic or specific before. Thankfully I had a meeting with a mental health nurse the next day.\n\nSo from that they have referred me on to a psychiatrist who deals with this kind of thing for my area, though I am still waiting for a call to arrange an appointment. And this gets down to the crux of it all, what do I want? I know what I want(ish). I want to be able to express my gender identity in public/at work without discrimination/prejudice/hate or judgement by other people, I assume this is want most if not all people want. But that isn't something I can change. So changing myself, I want to know what options I have as gender fluid person in the UK dealing with the NHS?\n\ntldr; I'm an AMAB gender fluid individual going between male/female/agender and I'm looking for advice about options available for where I am?\n\n"", 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'Intro, info, and advice seeking', 'created': 1544145346.0}"

We are very close to my wife's family, and my 16yo child, Z, has announced they want to tell them their gender, their new name, and ask them to use correct pronouns.

Most of them will be fine with this, but there is one person, the patriarch of the family, who I worry, may not. There are already tensions between Z and him because of some of the things he has said. He really isnt an asshole - hes a very decent person actually. But he is old-school, and he is not going to get it straight away. He is kind of the reason we want to manage this by sending the email first, so he doesnt say something he will regret later. Z has zero patience for this views, and we want to avoid a blow up, particularly from Z who may lose her shit.

My wife and I have decided to write a short email to everyone just to fill them in on what Z will be telling them on Sunday, and asking for their support.

The dot points are:

1. Z is non binary
2. Z has a new name
3. Z wants everyone to use correct pronouns: them /they

There are already tensions between Z and him because of some of the things he has said. He really isnt an asshole - hes a very decent person actually. But he is old-school, and he is not going to get it straight away. He is kind of the reason we want to manage this by sending the email first, so he doesnt say something he will regret later. Z has zero patience for this views, and we want to avoid a blow up, particularly from Z who may lose her shit.\n\nMy wife and I have decided to write a short email to everyone just to fill them in on what Z will be telling them on Sunday, and asking for their support.\n\nThe dot points are:\n\n1.

I dress like a man act like one. So on. But ice always had fantasies about being a woman. 

I started experiencing with anal sex toys and it’s great.  I try to get rid of all the body hair in certain places of body but not all. Have back waxed, do other things at home.

2018-12-19 09:32:09,a7kxnf,1,1,"Disclaimer: Long, venty, and rambly. I'll be honest I'm mostly trying to work through my feelings and stress right now.

&amp;#x200B;

For the most part, I mostly just lurk Reddit and participate rarely in just a couple of subreddits (this one included). But since I lurk more subreddits than I post in, I sometimes see posts in the vein of ""nonbinary/agender/genderfluid is stupid and made up,"" or ""so many people claiming to be trans/nonbinary/etc. these days are just trying to get attention,"" and every time it sends me into another series of self-doubting thoughts.

Trying to decide that maybe I was genderfluid was tricky for me, and admittedly I mostly only decided ""yeah I'm going to try this and commit,"" when I talked with a few old friends (one cis and one genderfluid) and they were both assuring and supportive and helped me try to understand what it was I was  feeling. One of my biggest problems was worrying I was trying to enter a space I didn't really belong in just for some sort of ""special points"" or something. One told me that they didn't think I was trying to be ""super special"" while the other told me that every non-cis person they've known have had some of the thoughts and worries I was having, while none of the cis people they knew did (including themself.)

But every time I see a ""lol transtrenders!"" type post or rant, I'm right back to that place of, ""oh god I'm just trying to be extra special, I'm totally wrong about this. Im AFAB and mostly present femme/semi androgynous, I'm just lying, I'm not genderfluid, maybe cis people really do feel like this and I'm just cis trying to be extra special."" And basically I beat myself down about it, and question myself over and over again.

""I don't think I have dysphoria, so I'm clearly wrong."" Though at other times I've been trying to figure out if I *might* have dysphoria that manifests as anxiety. (hard to say because I have depression and anxiety that I never thought could be dysphoria related.) But then think, ""Well, getting insomia from anxiety because my hair feels too long isn't necessarily dysphoria"" (yes that has happened recently. I hadn't gotten my hair cut in six months and one night I realized it and was struggling with sleep for two nights after.)

""Well I don't have a problem being called 'she' and I don't hate being a woman."" Except the times where I've internally cringed at the word ""woman"" being applied to me that set off ""odd"" feelings that I can't say I could describe beyond just ""odd."" I don't know if this kind of comes with being genderfluid though, if sometimes I'm perfectly fine and can even think, ""maybe I'm just cis,"" only for x amount of time later my mind shifts on that and goes, ""NOPE not cis, I don't want to be seen as just female."" But I also don't know what that ""not female"" part is yet.

""I didn't have dysphoria or anything when I was younger, so I'm only thinking I'm this because I know a lot more. I'm just trying to be special."" Honestly, this I have no idea how to argue against or defend. When I was a young teen, I adamantly rejected overly feminine clothes like skirts, and exclusively wore pants so much so that even to nice events I wore dress pants instead of dresses. But during that time I was also dealing with a moderately abusive family life and I didn't discover a lot about myself until after I moved out and whatever ""survival mode"" my brain was in was able to shut off. (Hell I didn't realize how abusive my family life was until that point)

So overall I just feel anxious, frustrated, and stressed out again. All because of a, ""people who identify as anything other than binary trans are just making it up for attention,"" post that I happened to run across several hours ago. I wish those posts wouldn't bother me, because it's not like I'm trying to identify genderfluid for other people, or something I would really parade around to strangers beyond how I choose to present. It's not something I want strangers to outright know because, yeah, I'm afraid (yay anxiety). I'm mostly just doing it for myself, to understand myself and be comfortable with myself. So other people's opinions shouldn't bother me in theory. But nope, my brain doesn't work that way with this.

2018-12-30 23:53:00,ab1cpn,3,1,"Hey, I'm very new here and very nervous. 

I've felt uncomfortable in my own skin for my whole life. Sometimes I'm fine with being a girl, and sometimes I am just NOT. I used to be really open about my fluidity, but for the past year I've been suppressing and hiding myself due to a travel job that forced me to be in close contact with very transphobic coworkers. During this period, I met a guy. 

Fast forward, I leave that toxic job. Our relationship has been amazing for 8 months. I've talked to him about dysphoria and he seems understanding in the moment. He even bought me a binder and several outfits. However... I've presented as masc in front of him twice, and each time he's had an anxiety attack about our relationship. He's scared, because he is less sexually attracted to me and doesn't want our dynamic to change. He is also scared, because he doesn't want that to stop me from being who I am. He firmly believes that I should pursue a lifestyle that makes me happy, and doesn't want to stand in the way of it. 

Just because I am making a big change by re-exploring my identity doesn't mean this isn't a change for him, too. I've been uncomfortable for my whole life, but this is probably very sudden for him.

Sometimes I'm fine with being a girl, and sometimes I am just NOT. I used to be really open about my fluidity, but for the past year I've been suppressing and hiding myself due to a travel job that forced me to be in close contact with very transphobic coworkers.

He even bought me a binder and several outfits. However... I've presented as masc in front of him twice, and each time he's had an anxiety attack about our relationship. He's scared, because he is less sexually attracted to me and doesn't want our dynamic to change. He is also scared, because he doesn't want that to stop me from being who I am. He firmly believes that I should pursue a lifestyle that makes me happy, and doesn't want to stand in the way of it. \n\nJust because I am making a big change by re-exploring my identity doesn't mean this isn't a change for him, too.
