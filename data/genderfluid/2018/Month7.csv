In that conversation, it became apparent, even to a person as thick as me, that they were dealing with dysphoria of one sort or another. I knew they needed answers.

2018-07-01 20:50:06,8vcype,3,7,"(X-post from /r/MtF, hope that's alright)

I recently moved to a new area, and - as fate would have it - also recently started questioning my gender identity.

Since I need to find a new doctor *anyway,* I decided to pick a new doctor from a list of referrals from a local transgender services group.  You know... just in case.  I haven't made any concrete decisions about transition, yet, but I see nothing wrong with putting all the correct pieces in place, in the meantime.

In the interest of openness with my doctor, I think I'd like to be up-front, and share the open question of my gender during our first appointment.  I may even like to discuss HRT with her.

The thing is, I'm *not* 'out.'  And I haven't 'decided' to transition.  I still present very male.  I'm not even sure what I'd like to transition 'into' - I figure I can stop as soon as I find a balance I'm comfortable with.  If that means full transition, so be it.  If not, also fine.  I'm just trying to find the real 'me.'  I suspect I'm a bit fluid in this regard, as my feelings pendulum back and forth with each new day.

So my questions for this sub are:

1.  Do I have to be 'sure' that I want to transition, to be allowed a prescription for HRT?  What if I'm hoping for HRT to shed some light on my doubts and questions?  I'd prefer to have an honest relationship with my Dr., but I'd hate to find out that they refuse HRT for people who might 'change their mind' later.

2.  Do you have to 'present' female, for Drs to prescribe hormones?  Do i have to go in and ask for female pronouns, and use a female name?  I'm not ready for any of that.  I don't feel comfortable with it, because I don't 'feel' female yet.  Part of my interest in HRT, is finding out if it can help with that regard; sort of a chicken/egg situation.

3.  Do doctors consider non-binary or androgynous appearances as valid desires or end-goal, for MTF HRT?  Do they condone SERMs in conjuction with E2, for instance, to hinder breast growth and sort of 'customize' the feminization areas?

4.

2018-07-02 13:01:19,8vifrg,3,14,"So I’ve only recently starting struggling with my gender and I’ve very slowly came to accept what I am. So I should give some background:

I’m 14. I was assigned male at birth. I have a girlfriend who was previously “lesbian” before she realized I was also interested in her. When I started to open up about my gender, she also started questioning and now is probably also fluid. 

So a few nights ago I was a girl most definitely. I was texting my girlfriend about how much I would love to dress up and put on a face of makeup and I joked that I was the girlfriend she always wanted. But the thing was, I wouldn’t have been comfortable with she/her or they/them. Or he/him for that matter, but I wouldn’t consider switching.  I felt very odd. 

Later the next day she feels very masculine, as do I. She dresses up in a muscle tee and generally boyish clothes and I realized how jealous I was that she could express her gender in so many more ways than I can because “girls” are judged a lot less for putting on “boy” clothes than the other way around. If I put on makeup in my house I’d probably get confused looks and a really interrogative mother who would just make me take it off. 

My girlfriend (we still aren’t changing that title) has been planning to give me makeup so that I can feel better about myself when I’m girly.

I'm a male

I like to shave my legs

I like to paint my toes

I don't care which pronoun is used but I recognize masculine 
pronouns more.

I wish I had boobs.

I was raped by my neighbor's daughters growing up.

I was called gay throughout middle school and part of high 
school.

I like my penis.

I like girls.

I am trying to express myself more.

I wished I was a girl growing up.

I would steal maxi pads and put tampons up my butt as a child 
thinking that would make me a girl.

I like feminine clothing and I wish under garments wern't a 
forbidden topic.

I'm going through a lot of changes all at once and I'm losing 
myself in the process. I know who I am but I don't want others

2018-07-05 11:11:32,8w9m2d,2,9,"Why hello there lovelies,  Elizabeth here, 

So guess I'm just going to give alittle update on where I am at currently.

Apologies for not being so active :)

Here's some points:

\*My partner accepts me any way I am, always good to have that

\* I'm being alot more open and expressive with my gender identity (making more comments about how I am feeling and such)

\*I've realized that I am more confident and more social when I stop hiding my identity from myself 

\*I've contemplated on coming out to my family

\*I've come to terms with myself when it comes to my gender identity and I'm now more comfortable with myself 

I spent an hour in front of my mirror one morning and basically had a talk with myself really loud (No doubt if someone was awake, they heard). I told myself everything negative someone could tell me if I came out to them and I was able to formulate a response or explanation to it.  I then gave myself a ""pep talk"" and began crying to myself once I said these words. 

""You only want the people you love to understand what it's like to live in your head. To see the world and your body the way you see it. They would understand, without explanation, what you've gone through for so long. You only desire to be free and happy, whether you're a boy, girl, neither or somewhere in between. You'll never know how you will feel tomorrow, but at least you can identify it when you feel it, that's more then you could do a year ago.  Just look at yourself over the past few days, you're able to look at yourself in the mirror and say confidently that you love yourself, and that you think you're beautiful. You thought you could never see yourself as beautiful, but now that you have began to accept who you are, you're able to love yourself more then ever. You need to stop lying to yourself. Stop being a coward and be honest with yourself, at least yourself. How can someone else accept you if you cannot accept yourself? Stop lying to yourself. You deserve to love yourself, and that's non-debatable.  You're going to take these three weeks to find yourself and love yourself, then you're coming out. That's that.""

So yes, I've made a commitment to my inner coach that I will come out of the gender- closet in three weeks. With all of this exploration and personal acceptance, I am still worried about my families reaction. 

Can anyone give me advice on how to come out to my family?

It would be appreciated.

Or do you think I should even come out? 

Please give me all the responses :)

She was never supportive of it, and maybe hid her disgust of it from me. I was still able to CD, but had to hide it from her.

Over the last year I’ve been more interested in exploring that side of me beyond just CDing. I’ve started dressing out, but still subtle enough that few people can tell. I’ve also opted to stop getting a haircut.

Coming out to her was a result of her nagging me to get a haircut, but I asked her why it was so important to her that I got one. Her response was that “women grow their hair long. Do you want to be a woman?” To which I responded, “the length of one’s hair doesn’t determine their gender,” and “no, I have no interest in being a woman, but I want to look like what I want to look like.”

She didn’t like this answer as she implied that I wanted to go full-time CD, and then questioned my sexuality.

I reminded her that who I am attracted to (women) sexually has no bearing as to how I want to look. I love being in “guy” mode, but sometimes I like to feel that part of myself in “girl”mode.

She then remarked that I’ve become “obsessive”. I asked her to clarify. She told me that she tolerated that I liked to wear lingerie and began wearing them no matter what mode I’m in, but that I liked to dress as the gender I felt like bordered on obsessive (and therefore implied that I had a problem). 

Again, I disagreed. I said that I see nothing wrong in being who I want to be.  I’m still the same person, in pants or a skirt. I said she was the one with the hang up as she felt that if a man’s outward appearance resembles a woman he must want to be one (and vice verse). She said if she wanted to be with a woman, she would be an L.

I then said to her that she should see the person I am inside and realize that I am, and always will be, the same person. If she cannot accept that this is part of who I am then we should not be together.

Her response was that “you want it to be over so you can continue to live this way.”

So in essence, I feel that she is not open to understanding what it means to be gender fluid. I really would like her to understand, as I love her. 

What kind of resources would you recommend to help those on the outside looking in?

2018-07-13 01:06:41,8yfjtk,15,29," If I had to answer the question of whether I was a man or a woman, I would have to say both.

Yes, I was born into a male body, but my soul has two genders.

I am one person with two halves: a male half and a female half.

Although I was raised as a man, I believe my female half was always there. It just took me awhile to discover that. But once I did, it was impossible to ignore. When you spend your entire life only able to express one of your two genders, you get used to it. I still largely act male and dress male, which doesn't mean that my female half isn't there, it just means that most of the time her gender is something that remains buried deep within me, but every now and then, it'll be her turn to physically express herself the way she wants to while my male half takes the backseat. Her turns are much shorter than my male half's turns, but that's because it's more convenient to live as my birth gender. So although I can give my male half more control over my appearance, it doesn't mean that my female half doesn't exist, or that I can pretend it doesn't.

My male half has a morality based on tradition. My female half has a morality based on instinct. My male half is religious. My female half is spiritual. My male half is an extrovert. My female half is an introvert. My male half is a thinker. My female half is a feeler. My male half is a writer. My female half, a painter and a musician, the source of the raw artistic images and emotions that my male half organizes in his stories. Which is not to say that my male half is entirely devoid of emotion, or that my female half is entirely devoid of thought. The thoughts of my female half are more straightforward, the thoughts of my male half more complex. The emotions of my male half are subtle like a candle, the emotions of my female half are passionate like a campfire. One half is structure; the other is flow and flexibility. What I'm trying to say here is that I need both. If I killed one half and kept the other, I wouldn't be me anymore. Even if you've only seen me when I'm presenting as a male, you've still probably seen my female half in action.

This afternoon, I was feeling incredibly gender dysphoric. I got nauseous when I looked in the mirror. I hated the clothes I was wearing. I lay down on my bed paralyzed with the feeling, on the verge of tears just doing nothing for hours besides trying to chase the feeling away. So I did something that I'd never done before: I tried to have a conversation in my head between the two halves. I closed my eyes, meditated, and tried to split my consciousness into two halves, which was difficult. But as I felt myself dissolving, I could feel the two halves forming in the two sides of my body and the two sides of my brain. I could see him on the left, sitting amidst stacks of books, and her on the left, wearing a white dress and dancing in a field of flowers. I could see their history together. How when they were children, he was the mischievous trickster while she was exuberant and affectionate; then as teenagers, she became vulnerable and confused, and he protected her until she grew self-assured again.

I visualized them sitting together at a table in a restaurant. She's upset and he asks her what's wrong.

""I don't mind being cooped up in here,"" she says, referring to the subconscious that surrounds them, ""But I deserve to be able to dress up and feel pretty every once in a while.""

""You will,"" he replies, ""Just wait a day or two and then it'll be the weekend and we can crossdress with friends. You know we're saving our good dress for then, and even if we weren't, you know we can't wear a dress while our parents are in the house.""

She starts sobbing and puts her head down on the table and doesn't stop. It feels good to get all that emotion out. Concerned for her, he tries to think of ways to comfort her.

""Here, eat something, you'll feel better,"" he says, passing her a small piece of steak on a fork from his plate. She eats it and starts to calm down. ""What can we do to help you relax and make you feel better? We could take a bubble bath, eat some desserts... maybe we can't dress up until the weekend, but I'm sure we can compromise and find something that will cheer you up in the meantime. Does that sound good?""

""Yeah,"" she says, drying away her tears, ""But on one condition. I want to shave off all our facial hair. And I want to put on makeup... not too much, but just a little. I don't need to feel like a woman entirely, but I want to feel a little more feminine, even if it's just a little, just so I don't feel so ugly and trapped. Then we can go downstairs and have a healthy snack. Something better than steak.""

""Ok, then, it's a deal,"" he says.

It wasn't a particularly long conversation, but afterwards, I got up with more clarity as to what was going on inside me and what I could do about it. I shaved, put on makeup, then went downstairs and ate a peach, and then I felt much better. So I guess this is a good strategy for dealing with this kind of conflict in the future.

I guess it's a good time to share my story. Let's go deep. I'm AMAB (assigned male at birth). I started crossdressing at home when I was 15 years old -- my sister was off to college and had left some unwanted clothes behind. So whenever my parents were out of the house I'd sneak into her room and try on her things. I had no explanation for my behavior and felt terribly guilty about it, because I was raised in an Evangelical Conservative Christian family. I felt like God was watching and was seeing an abomination. I was so ashamed and I did everything I could to keep it absolutely secret.

My first exposure to transgender people was through 4chan. There were regular t\*\*p (cencored because it's a slur) threads on /b/. It was a very unhealthy community of chasers, revenge porn, and cyberbullying. BAD. I remember feeling confused and guilty. I wasn't sure whether I was attracted to t\*\*ps or jealous, I was afraid of being gay, I felt like what I was doing was wrong, and I kept lurking these threads for unexplained reasons. I was into ""fap roulettes,"" which are essentially a game that commands you to crossdress or masturbate anally or whatever. It was the only way I could give myself permission to experiment.

When I went to college I began questioning my religion, became an atheist and then an agnostic. I was so afraid of losing my family that I didn't tell them about my loss of faith. They would always ask if I had found a church and I'd say I was still looking, until eventually it became obvious I wasn't. In the meantime I rebuilt my morals from the ground up. I realized my gay roommate wasn't an abomination and neither was I, but I never let go of my shame. I had classified my ""issue"" as a sex fetish. The first person I confided in was an ex-girlfriend I thought was a friend. I told her I was shaving my legs and asked her to teach me some things. We later had a falling out and she threatened to call my parents and out me, tell them I was gay, and mix truths with untruths to make it worse. She didn't follow through on her threat but I felt so betrayed, hurt, and vulnerable that I purged. I gathered the few pieces of female clothing I had, mascara and waxing kit, and threw them in a dumpster. I cleared my internet history and regrew my leg hair. I made sure there was no evidence and I trusted nobody with my secret for five years.

I went into software engineering. About a year into my job, a person sharing my office came out as trans. She sent a really short email to the team: ""Today I'm bringing my authentic self. Please use she/her pronouns for me from now on."" And that was it! A team of almost all cis guys got used to the pronouns and showed her support and respect. It restored some faith in humanity I had forgotten I'd lost. And her bravery has stayed with me and inspired me ever since.

I met my partner playing Dungeons and Dragons. She became my friend and eventually she asked me on a date, and not too long after that I realized I was in love with someone I could really trust for the first time. I opened myself to her a little bit at a time, about my submissive side, my interest in lingerie, my deep fear of betrayal and humiliation. She kept my secret. She said I could try on her clothes as long as I was respectful. We bought a strapon together and she penetrated me. We switched, sometimes I was her boyfriend and sometimes her girlfriend. We went to drag shows together all the time. At some point I realized that it's not weird, it's not an issue, and what is weird and an issue is how shameful I still felt. I finally gave myself permission to explore my relationship with gender. I bought breast inserts and a wig and I borrowed my partner's clothes. I looked silly and felt amazing; it was gender euphoria. 

I started to think back and recontextualize my past experiences. Times I was jealous of other women. Times I told myself it was a sex fetish, but my behavior was not sexual. Times I had strong urges to play female characters in games. Am I female? I looked online for trans experiences, memes, selfies, to see if I could relate. And what was really confusing was that I resonated with some things, but not everything. I  wish I could be a girl, but I don't hate my penis. I want dresses and makeup and I'm afraid of walking into a store and buying them. I'd like a more feminine body in some ways but I'm freaked out by the idea of HRT changing my brain. I don't want to change my name. I don't mind being a man except for the part where it means I can't be a woman.

I came out as genderfluid. First, to myself. Then to my partner, to a friend, to some strangers, to my sister, the rest of my friends, and I'm working up the courage to tell my parents. Each time I tell someone my truth, it's a weight off of my chest, and the shame I feel dissipates bit by bit. I've found it's always a bigger deal to me than it is to them, and that's okay. They haven't carried this weight for ten years and I'm not placing any burden on them, just to use they/them pronouns for me when I'm in full drag. I feel liberated. I haven't become a different person; I have given myself permission to be me.

2018-07-13 21:21:12,8ynwni,11,4,"Hey everyone.   
I would like to start of to tell you all something about myself.

I'm 32 year old male cis hetero, I'm basically as vanilla as can get. I'm a social worker and have been for 10 years. I'm also a socialist and very much believe in accepting everyone, even if you don't understand jack about it.

That said, I've always been interested in everything that I don't understand, that doesn't mean I get to understand everything, but I want to try as much as possible anyway.

About a year ago I found out my sister is trans, shock sure, but I'm truly happy she told us and now lives as a woman. Her happiness is a million times more important than the confused feelings I had when I found out. That said there was 100&amp;#37; acceptance from the get go.

Anyhoo, started to pay even more attention to everything about gender (like most, I grew up with the idea that sex and gender were the same), and I heard about genderfluid. While I can understand transgender for the most part, I mean not how it must have felt, but the idea that their gender doesn't match completely with the biological body they were born with, is understandable.

Genderfluid however I don't get, so I want to ask you all some questions and I hope it helps me understand you all a little better. :) PS I realize most of this can be found on the web, but I rather have some human interaction, especially since a lot of it is personal anyway.

If some of my oversimplification feels offense, know that none of that is my intention.  


\- How does genderfluid feel in your day to day life. I mean we got women who can dress up all in 'typical' female clothing with make up and everything, or put on some jeans, t shirt, put her hair up and I guess got a bit of a 'typical' male attitude of throwing something easy together. Where does genderfluid kick in that makes the experience so different?

\- Is different clothing that we as a society deem male or female, be a requirement to address how you feel that day? Or could you say I throw on a skirt everyday and I don't give a rats ass what people think (regardless of a biological male or female body as well)

\- Does it bother you if someone calls you he or she because depending on your biological body, you look more like 1 then the other? Do you correct them? Do you then prefer he/she, or they?

\- If he/she bothers you and prefer to use they, why exactly? They in language is of course use to address multiple people, so I'm always confused why that word is use (I get the wish for a neutral word, I just don't get why this one is used), and why does he/she bother you? I get to a certain degree (I don't mean that in a dismissive way, but really in a way that I don't understand many parts of it) that it may not fit your gender feeling at that moment, but it's history of course stems from biology, got a penis and you are a he, got a vagina you got a she. For me it's hard to understand that while I fully accept ones gender and personality, I would be considered offensive if I were to say she to someone who has a biological female body and also leaves it at that (or is that something that most change?). So basically I would be saying she to her gender, but to her biology. And while I get that I wouldn't do this to a trans person, and therefor it seems hypocritical, but there I have the feeling that biology didn't do it's job completely right, and when they go into transition it's also easier - and yes again I realize that this is not a good reason, but hopefully you are getting my point.

\- How fluid is your gender, I read some about having certain days, but is it something you wake up with, or does it change through the course of a day. Does something trigger it?

\- How is the experience for biological women to be pregnant? I know transmen have major issues with this, causing a lot of gender dysphoria?

\- How are relationships with straight people? I mean physically I'm only interested in the 'female' body, so say I were to meet a great person who has a female body, but their gender would change, I don't think that would bother me, but then again I have no clue.

\- What changes for you from day to day, from clothing to personality traits to emotions etc?

\- What are the biggest misunderstandings people have?

I'm a social worker and have been for 10 years. I'm also a socialist and very much believe in accepting everyone, even if you don't understand jack about it.\n\nThat said, I've always been interested in everything that I don't understand, that doesn't mean I get to understand everything, but I want to try as much as possible anyway.\n\nAbout a year ago I found out my sister is trans, shock sure, but I'm truly happy she told us and now lives as a woman. Her happiness is a million times more important than the confused feelings I had when I found out. That said there was 100&amp;#37; acceptance from the get go.\n\nAnyhoo, started to pay even more attention to everything about gender (like most, I grew up with the idea that sex and gender were the same), and I heard about genderfluid. While I can understand transgender for the most part, I mean not how it must have felt, but the idea that their gender doesn't match completely with the biological body they were born with, is understandable.\n\nGenderfluid however I don't get, so I want to ask you all some questions and I hope it helps me understand you all a little better. :) PS I realize most of this can be found on the web, but I rather have some human interaction, especially since a lot of it is personal anyway.\n\nIf some of my oversimplification feels offense, know that none of that is my intention.  \n\n\n\\- How does genderfluid feel in your day to day life. I mean we got women who can dress up all in 'typical' female clothing with make up and everything, or put on some jeans, t shirt, put her hair up and I guess got a bit of a 'typical' male attitude of throwing something easy together. Where does genderfluid kick in that makes the experience so different?\n\n\\- Is different clothing that we as a society deem male or female, be a requirement to address how you feel that day? Or could you say I throw on a skirt everyday and I don't give a rats ass what people think (regardless of a biological male or female body as well)\n\n\\- Does it bother you if someone calls you he or she because depending on your biological body, you look more like 1 then the other? Do you correct them? Do you then prefer he/she, or they?\n\n\\- If he/she bothers you and prefer to use they, why exactly?

I am female but I sometimes feel like a woman and sometimes like a man. 
As long as I can remember I have had moments in which I felt like I would have wanted to be a boy rather than a girl. 

After years of trying to fit into the model 'cisgender - heterosexual', having boyfriends, trying to repress myself when I felt like I wanted to be a boy; I finally discovered the LGBT community. As many people I wasn't really aware of the difference between gender identity and sexual orientation so I started to identify as a lesbian as I liked girls. 

I became more familiar with the concept of gender and gender identity and started wondering if I was transgender. I realised that my gender identity was really variable, I sometimes felt like a girl and sometimes like a boy. During my 'boy' moments, I felt really connected to the stories of transsexual people as, just like some of them, I felt like my body didn't represent who I really was and I would have much rather wanted to have a male body. The only problem was that I didn't feel like this all the time and every time I thought about transitioning I felt like I would be betraying the part of me that sometimes feels like a girl and is perfectly happy in my female body. Sometimes I am also 'in between' and I don't feel like the categories 'boy' or 'girl' fit me. I'm neither, or both at the same time.

I visited my best friend over the last 2 weeks, traveling 500miles up north to meet her face to face for the first time (we only had online contact before). And while there, i finally felt like i could, y'know, let loose a bit. Wear something other than shirts and pants, maybe. Try to be a bit more feminine, at least around my friend because i know i can trust her not to make it awkward...

.... aaand i ended up buying dresses and tights and panties with her, wearing them pretty much constantly, swapping clothes (we got the same dress size); i even found out what my general style is (slightly gothy punk, apparently) and the entire time -and i mean the ENTIRE TIME- i was there, not a single person looked at me funny or laughed or even made so much as a disagreeing noise. In fact, every single person i came into direct contact with either treated me perfectly normal or actually complimented my look. And i got a ton of nods and smiles on the street as well, which is still baffling me to no end. People called me *cute*, both to my face and behind my back. Nobody called me cute before, ever. People just accepted me without a second thought.

I don't think i ever felt so *alive* and *happy* in my entire life as i did in those last 14 days. And i am determined to not let this slide away from me. I am out now. Officially. More dresses for me, more hotpants and more painted toes when i happen to feel like being girly. I am done hiding half of who i am. And i feel good about it!

2018-07-20 21:53:10,90k5ud,1,1,"Hi,

About a year ago I first had the thought that I was gender fluid, which was fine by me.  I find myself fantasizing about being a girl, but have no dysphoria, and I actually love my body and face.  I have no problem with acting and being referred to as a man, but female pronouns and fantasies get me excited. Now I recently realized I have autogynephelia (arousal at the thought of having a woman's body. Negative connotations aside, this is just the term that describes me best) and I'm freaking out that I might actually be trans.  

The only reason this is freaking me out is because so many sources say that autogynepheliacs are often just late onset trans people, I've yet to find a gender fluid autogynepheliac.  I'm worried I will develop euphoria later in life and then regret not transitioning when I can actually ""pass"". So it's like a ticking timer and I'm already 22.  I almost feel like it would be easier if I just knew for sure that I was trans because then there would be no question of what to do.  

Also transitioning would prevent me from accomplishing lifestyle goals that I can't accomplish if I was a girl.  Like I prefer to have a male singing voice (even though I know hrt doesn't change voice, but I would be embarrassed with my voice as a girl).  

I would feel so much better to hear that another gender fluid person has autogynephelia, like just knowing its a ""combination"" that happens to people.  I feel like gender fluid could apply to me, but most people talk about how one day they're a man and one day they're a woman.  For me it's the same, but the switch happens like every 3 hours.

2018-07-21 00:49:37,90lefw,6,8,"I’m 17 and I’ve always identified as gay, but now I’m not so sure that I am male. I definitely don’t always feel like a woman, but sometimes I experience a degree of gender dysphoria. Like a few months ago I thought of the fact that I won’t be able to become pregnant and it really bothered me for the rest of the day. I really desired to be in the state of pregnancy - it just didn’t seem right. More recently I found myself really wishing that I could have boobs. I’ve never found them even remotely attractive, but for some reason I really felt like I should have them. As far as energy goes I sometimes feel more feminine and I’ve never felt particularly masculine. I generally present in a modern/trendy but ultimately masculine manner, but that’s because my family isn’t comfortable with me expressing my feminine side while they’re around. And, most of all, the label “cis” REALLY seems wrong to me and I hate even the idea of being cis. It’s just an immediate no. 

I think that I might be somewhere in the realm of gender fluid. I have a lot of friends who are trans/nb/queer and I’ve asked them some questions, but ultimately I feel like it’s appropriation for me to claim that I’m genderfluid because I have some limited experience with dysphoria. I want to respect those who have it worse than me by not using a label that I haven’t earned, ya feel? Also I read Ash Hardell’s book (The ABCs of LGBT+) and it helped me to understand gender fluidity. 

I guess I’m just trying to gain some insight from true genderfluid people on how you came to understand your gender. Did any of you have similar experiences to me, or was your dysphoria much greater than mine? Please, feel free to ask questions!

**My (AFAB) husband (cis bro) cheated on me,** and I found out about it today several months after the fact.

That this *very classically feminine* woman had to Facebook message me**\*** with proof of the incident and apologies that she didn't know he was in a relationship is the nasty fucking kneecapper. She said they continued to text and flirt until she found his social profiles, saw how I feature in his pix, and had her ""oh shit"" moment. *ouch*

He said he needs flirting and girliness and got stressed and frustrated and didn't know how to deal. I know he needs this. I know I'm not a great supply of flirting and girliness. (I'm working on fulfilling these needs but it's like learning a new role and new set of lines and is bigger effort than I think he realizes when I'm not feeling very femme.) I told him as much, and asked him if he thinks he made the wrong choice in marrying me. He said he knows what he married and doesn't expect this from me and that he loves me for who I am.

*Great, way to respect that, bud.* /s

**Here is how I wish this went down:**

I wish he would have talked to me about this before getting on dating apps. This cowardly piece of shit (damn husband rn not dear husband, forgive my budding anger) didn't tell me when this happened or speak up about any of the angst that led to it, and I'm not sure if he would have ever come clean.

I want his needs fulfilled just as I don't want to be someone I'm not. I go out dressed as Hot Babe with him but I'm still...me. I think having an outside source of this flirtation is absolutely something I want to explore for us.**\*\*** I brought it up to him before, that he needs to find an outlet for it and maybe he should loop in some other women. 

I'm really Not Cool with *fucking* without talking to me about it first but am more than chill on the extramarital fucking given safety parameters, open communication, and of course reciprocal permission on my end to experiment and fool around.

Anyway, this post is getting really long so I'll wrap it up. Most of the time I feel really great about my life as a genderfluid person but this dug up a lot of old insecurities that have long been at rest (Hello, old friends! How have you been?) and I'm just disgusted right now at the scales that have newly fallen from my eyes.

I'm just a typical guy. Muscular build and I like being a guy, doing normal ""guy"" things. 
But there's a major part of me that loves femininity. And lately it's been depressing me more that I don't act on it. 
I have a unhealthy obsession with nailpolish, heels, and makeup in particular. 
I will often look at a woman when I'm out and I think either she is beautiful, or I wish I could be her.
But my issue is Im ok with being a man. But I'd also love to be a woman. 
I like having Male genitals but sometimes I wish I had female ones. 

Over the years I've wondered if I'm just into crossdesssing. Because I loved shaving my legs and painting my nails watching romance movies in langerie and my exs sweatpants and shirt while playing with my really long hair and fake nails. But I feel its more than that. I sometimes just don't feel like a man. I feel different. I feel like the woman I described not just a man wearing girls things.

So I question if I'm non binary. Or maybe I'm finally letting go of the denial. I've known I loved certain things for a while. But only once my now ex girlfriend helped me feel it's ok to be myself I really started to explore it with her.

My current wife isn't supportive of this. She is only ok with me doing my toenails. 
Even painting my toenails makes me feel drastically better about myself. Especially if I shave my legs.

Honestly writing this and just getting it off my chest feels good. I'm 28yo. And I've held this in forever. I've only accepted this part of myself since I was 22 and that's when I started to explore it. But I still feel so lost.

And any feedback or suggestions from anyone who may understand and know what may help me or what I am would be great. Is this normal? I feel most people want one or the other.

2018-07-27 15:46:22,92dmyu,0,0,"A bit of a rant and also a bit of me figuring out my identity and who I am and how a few people in my life make me feel for not fitting into their cookie cutter design.

I just came to the realisation recently that the way I feel about ""they/them"" pronouns is how I feel about using them for myself, not how I feel about other people using them. I've always been kind of uncomfortable with them, but I could never understand why. I feel that they're informal and I'm uncomfortable with using them for myself. I'm in no way saying people can't have ""they/them"" pronouns, I'm saying I don't personally want to use them. 

I have a few people (Non-binary and cis folks alike) I know that make me feel like, I'm wrong for using ""she/her"" pronouns. I feel like people aren't respecting my pronouns because they're not what they expect them to be. Like there's one right way to express yourself. I feel pressured to use ""they/them"" pronouns and I'm not comfortable with that. 

They're not my pronouns, ""she/her"" arent my pronouns either, but I'm more comfortable with them because ""she/her"" is exclusively singular.

So, when I first found out about the whole ‘transgender’ thing, a couple of years ago, I heavily identified with the whole idea of genderfluidity, and was pretty happy with that label, but over time I started kind of identifying differently. I identified as nonbinary for a year or so, then I began to identify as masculine. I’ve been identifying as masculine for several years, chose out a name for myself and everything (I’ve been going by Jeremy for about 2 years now). 
But recently, I’ve been identifying with genderfluidity more, which is cool and all, and I’m okay with that, but I’ve been a little confused. I wanna identify as more masculine, and just kinda generally be seen as more masc, even on feminine days. I still get dysphoria about my body quite a lot, even though I’m quite happy presenting as feminine, if that makes sense? I feel as if I’d be happier if I was AMAB. My gender fluctuates a lot, but overall I’d prefer to be seen as masculine. I get happy when people I don’t know use he/him pronouns for me, or refer to me as male. It upsets me when I’m seen as female, for the most part. It doesn’t bother me as much on feminine days, but it still kinda bothers me, unless it’s people I’m actually close with. I was just wondering if anyone else had experienced something similar because it’s rather stressful and making me feel like. Super invalid?? Idk haha if anyone’s got advice or input hmu
I’ve also been wanting to change my name to something more gender neutral. I dislike my birth name, and I don’t think my chosen name quite fits me anymore. I’ve been going by Castiel for a while now to close friends and people online, but I allow people close to me to call me Winnie on feminine or more androgynous days. How do y’all go about telling people about your preferred names and genderfluidity? Do you just go by one name, or let them know daily, even if you don’t know them well?

2018-07-31 05:33:12,93bqmd,1,13,"Hello everyone! 

I want to start this post by saying that I am not an expert but I do know my fair share about being genderfluid. (Also I am on mobile so forgive me for formatting errors) Also, there is some mention of sexual organs but I don't know if this classifies as NSFW

So now that I have that out of the way let's start!

So let's start with a definition:

&gt;*Genderfluid* : A gender identity in which the person gender fluctuates on a spectrum, usually between being male, female, Bigender or agender.

TLDR: sometimes you identify as male, female, both or neither.

*What are someways to know if you are genderfluid?*

1) Sometimes you wish you had the opposite sexes genitals but not all the time. This could mean want boobs and a vagina instead of a penis or vica versa or sometimes you want a penis and boobs.

2) You like to crossdress. Example: (AMAB [Assigned male at birth]) who likes to dress up in dress or female clothes.

3) sometimes you feel like the opposite gender.

4) You like things that are typically for the opposite gender only. Though you could just like that stuff so this one is kind of on the edge.
 Example: AMAB likes lip gloss, high heels, dresses

5) You identify as genderfluid. No one can tell you what to identify as. You get to choose. As I said I am not an expert.

Now, if you figured out your gender identity. then great! I will now give some bonus tip of what not to do.

1) go and make short videos with this joke

&gt;""So what is in your pants""
""(enterJokeHere)""

Usually the answer is something like death. Now I am not saying that this never happens (I know from personal experience it does) it is just over used.

2) COME OUT IF YOU ARE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH YOURSELF. I know from personal experience that it is not good to come out if you are not ready. It is over whelming and you will regret your desiscion and go start questioning yourself. 

3) Introduce yourself by saying

&gt; hi my name is (enterNameHere) and I am genderdluid.

This will make people think you are making it up to get attention.

Now some things to definitely do!

1) If you are comfortable with yourself, then get yourself some clothes of the opposit gender. You don't have to wear them in public but on nights when you are feeling dysphoric put on the clothes and you will feel better.

Example: AMAB: get a dress, bra (that fits) and a t shirt

AFAB: get some male t-shirts and male jeans.

2)  Get comfortable with yourself before you come out.

I hope this has helped someone as that is my goal!
