2018-05-04 01:55:25,8gvpys,1,1,"First of all I understand no one can answer that question for me and it has been long since I bothered about in which category my sexuality and gender fit. I just need to hear some other opinions and experiences. I decided to post here since how I feel about it has always been fluid in some way, though mostly I thought I was simply 'atypical male'.

**Backstory**\(**feel free to skip****\)**: So I am 23 AMAB and until I was 18 I never thought about gender. There were a few small signs before like other boys not making sense to me \(and they still don't\). I never had my style when it comes to clothing, no interest in male fashion, so I just let my parents pick. I NEVER felt connected \(to this day\) with my body and my looks, I barely knew how I look in the mirror and never understood how can people feel good about their looks.

Things changed when my depression started, but I made some new friends and realized I really am way more'natural' when hanging out with girls and also that I would cross\-dress. As it progressed I felt at one point I really didn't know which gender I was, and later there were times I hated my whole male body, even more because it made people simply assume I am a man \(I still wish they wouldn't\). But I ended up accepting I am just 'atypical' male with crossdressing wish. I got better after 3y, gained some confidence, self\-respect and autonomy. I thought all before was just some self\-hate and reconnecting with my ""feamle side"".

**The thing is:** I am not sure if I feel good alone with myself, or just with some things I do. I still try to look more feminine \(without being too obvious\) and it can really get me so happy but sometimes I notice my male face and I just think I look like an idiot. But it changes with my mood, if it's good I can be satisfied with little things and carry on as a male, when it's great I feel like trying out more, but when it's bad I get really sensitive about it and just wish I looked so much more feminine. I don't know if it's some kind of defense mechanism? Also when bad, my dreams \(very vivid\) about looking really feminine are more often, and I feel by a magnitude  better even days after them.

Lately it got bad, I lost some friends, but I also further questioned how others treat me and realized how much I still feel surpressed. I realized I often feel like a doll that someone can treat, use and dress how they want. It has to do with my boundaries and being passive, but also with my parents. Living with them I feel like ""I can't express myself""\(incl. being more feminine\)\- even though I don't have other problems than them not realizing I am grownup. I so want to get to live alone to the point of not wanting to live at all if I don't do it this year. And yet I am constantly sabotaging myself in that plan like I don't care about myself, I only look for distractions so I don't feel anything when alone.

And then there was a dream again about being female, but this time in it I told people to call me Juno and they did. I never thought about changing name but this one stuck sooo much with me, I felt so much better just calling myself Juno and like I kept wanting to be that person in my dream. But then I got very anxious, I don't hate myself like I used to but I still feel like somethings very wrong with me. Or I get frustrated and angry. Yesterday night my body felt like all needles. Then I feel scared about changing my look, I am not sure if how I feel about myself is actually 'bad' or just 'acceptable' and I am not sure I could wake up tomorrow and be a woman or how am I suppoused to feel then? I don't know if I just run away from my problems/myself by wanting to be a different gender, did I convince myself it is some sort of dysphoria?After all I've been fooling and surpressing myself before.

So that said, here's my name story.

Originally, I was assigned male at birth, and never questioned my assigned [male-first-name] [male-middle-name/father's-first-name] [father's-last-name] name. However, as I matured, I began to feel like my name was the wrong name, and sought a new one but never knew what it should be.

Then, finally, during a religious vow of silence, I discovered on the first day that my first name was *Christopher*, and went by that in my pen-and-paper-aided communications for the remainder of the vow.

Interestingly, my gender then flipped to to female during the vow (holy shit!), and I ended the vow on the evening of the ninth day after unintentionally saying the *female* name out loud, *Christy*.

I've since gone by both names, depending upon which gender role I was occupying, for example, Christopher at work and in legal situations, and Christy at home and with friends.

On the form I had to fill out to file for a name change, the following prompt was given:

---

[Explain here why you want to change your name.]

The reasons for this name change are as follows:____

---

Here is what I wrote:

---

As of Spring of 2016, I no longer go by [deadname] at all, and additionally I identify not as my birth-assigned gender of male, but as bigender.

Since then, I go by two other names, Christopher or Christy, depending upon which gender role I am occupying in a particular social circle.

I have chosen to make my legal first name to be Christopher because I have already been going by Christopher as early as age four, in the form of my nickname, Christopher Robin.

I have chosen to make my legal middle name to be Christy because that is the only place left to include it in my legal name.

2018-05-12 05:36:26,8iu3f1,3,3,"My name is Zairen and I'm a 19 year old genderfluid college student in Minnesota. I was assigned male at birth with the name Zachary. I've only recently come out to more of my friends but not to my family yet. I struggle with what is most likely depression and stress problems on a daily basis. I also deal with constant intrusive thoughts that range of self mockery to self harm and even suicide. I have a large problem with call of the void whenever doing something dangerous or has the potential for danger. When driving a vehicle there is constant thoughts just to swerve my car into an oncoming vehicle or somekind of building or pole. While I really don't have the urge myself to die it has become hard sometimes to seperate what thoughts are mine. On the outside to anyone that doesn't know what I'm going through I appear perfectly fine if not just a little somber. Even getting up is a struggle for me. It takes a good 2 to 3 hours before Im actually up. Doing homework is especially a struggle. I always have a little voice in the back of my head telling me that I should just give up and to quit. A lot of times I do end up listening to this voice and it hurts a lot. Because of my mental state happiness is a momentary situation backed by sadness and depression. The joy someone would get from their birthday or some other kind of positive event lasts maybe a few hours at best. Every moment is filled with self doubt and self hatred. Even when my best friends in the world do something positive for me I always have the suspicion that they are only doing it to appear for my own sake instead of out of actual kindness. Under the same train of thought I always think I'm some kind of burden upon those around me. I'm hyper aware of the way people percieve me and my presence to the point that I assume people automatically dislike my presence.

For me my gender identity is a curse and a blessing compared to many in the LGBT community. As a cis-passing person I don't have to worry about any kind of discrimination unless I make it publicly known what my gender identity is. I'm also lucky that as a genderfluid my disphoria is relatively small compared to other people. However, my identity is also a curse. Because of the fact that I can pass without out any work as a cis-male and I'm not ""fully trans"" acceptance by those in the LGBT community is difficult. I often feel like my identity isnt legitimate and that I'm appropriating the culture of those that have struggled more than I have.

I wish I was able to list positive things about myself but I somehow lack this ability. When trying to do so I automatically shun myself for being narcacisstic. With any kind of positive thought I find something negative to replace it with. Did good on a paper? THen I have to remind myself that I hate my body or that I'm some kind of failure that doesn't have a passion for anything. This lack of passion for anything is quite true though. I hold little passion or care for anything besides others. When it comes to careers or myself its next to impossible to make myself care. I could be someone's shoulder to cry on and be able to help solve their problems but I can barely drag myself to class or see a therapist. When I look at myself in the mirror I see a fat, short, dumb, ginger boy. When I look at myself I see failure, disappointment, and a waste of life. Despite not wanting to die I care very little for my well being beyond eating and bathing.

During all of this my biggest help was been my boss and friend Carter. They have helped me figure out and become comfortable with my identity. Carter is one of the few if not the only person I feel comfortable talking about anything personal with anymore. I can't talk to my parents about anything and Im terrified of other authority figures whether it be teachers, assistants, or therapists. This why I'm terrified of not being able to continue going to Morris. If can't come anymore I won't have a rock anymore. While my other friends have been accepting of my identity they either don't understand or can't relate fully. If I go to ARCC than I won't have this kind of community. If I stay at home then all I have to look forward to is verbal bullying by my parents, working constantly, and stayig in my room for the rest of the time. I may have the possibility of seeing a counselor but what good does that bring me when I have to go right back to the home which causes me so much stress and anxiety. At home I have little reason to exist or be a person. During high school I would next to always be in my room paying video games. Asking to see friends was not a right but a privelge. Of course that was when I was still in high school and not a legal adult. But now that I can be my own person with a few calls to declare myself independent why am I so terrified? Why don't I struggle with the idea of leaving the people that tried to raise a genius child that only grew up to disappoint them? Why I am I afraid to leave the home that mocked me for my anxiety issues when I was afraid the world was going to end. Why am I afraid to leave the home which I can't even associate any positive memoryies, a home that is just a house and nothing more, not even a real home. Why do I blame myself for all of this? Have I been lazy a bunch when it comes to solving my problems? Of course, but I shouldn't be afraid of just talking to someone that is wanting and willing to help. My parents are not the sole reason for this happening. Society at large played just as big of a role in me becoming the weak person I am if not bigger. But where were my parents during all of this trying to help me? Whenever I got bad grades in school they would constantly ask why I wasn't asking anyone for help. My answer was always I don't know which wasn't acceptable but I always knew deep down was that it was because I was afraid. In my sophmore year of highschool I finally decided to tell my parents the truth about a bad grade and that I needed help. My father was acepting but of course he had to tell my mother. as soon as I could hear her feeting pounding up the stairs I knew I wasn't going to be asking for help again. I was told to get out my spanish homework and to sit at the table. As soon as I did I was met with a hard slap against the back of the head which made my face fly towards the table. As I was crying my mother berated me for being a moron and that I wasn't going to amount to anything. This was not the only time this happened, in fact, it happened many times throughout my life. The one that sticks with me the most was when my parents found out about my last report card in senior year. I had dropped and failed a class in pseo because of stress and not knowing how to get help. As soon as they saw it I was hit in the face and knocked out of the chair I was sitting in. The same one I had been hit in during my sophmore year. I was told to stand up and when I did I was met with the same kind of verbal abuse I've been hit with before. What was different about this time was the physicality I faced. Instead of just the usual slaps I was met with punches to the body and kicks to the legs that were thrown with enough force that I ended up on the ground in tears. This is no where representative of the normal state of the household. Normally thingd go on just fine without a hitch but there was always an underlying feeling of tension ad uneasiness. What made the house particularily bad were the bad times. There were no different levels of anger, it was either a 0 or a 10 nothing inbetween. My parents were my own bullies. Everything I did was used against me whether it be my acne, my weight, or the people I associated with. I was simply never good enough. 

This behavior at home transfered heavily in school. I lacked any confidence in anything I was doing and hated people that were even slighty better than me. I learned quickly that the only was I would make it through school was being invisible and making as little of a splash as possible. I didn't want people to know me or be friends with me. I wanted to sit alone in silence at lunch and disappear into the sea of people and be nothing with everything. At the same time I began to question my gender identity which made me want to hide even more as I didn't even understand myself at that point. What made this especially worse is that I grew up in a heavily conservative area where people were both openly homophobic and transphobic. I thought I was less than human, a monster if anything. this is where my intrusive thoughts began. On a constant basis my mind was swarming itself that it was worthless and didn't deserve to live. If I had lived in a different household I could have gone to my parents for help and acceptance and I would have been in a way better place than I would be now. But instead I know I would have been openly mocked. Only a few years prior I had deceloped a strong fear of the world ending at the end of the Mayan calendar. Was it silly? definelty, but I was terrified. I struggled with sleeping and eating to the point it started affecting my grades. I eventually started seeing a counselor at school but soon stopped when my parents found out and began mocking me for it and acting as if I done someting wrong. If I couldn't trust my parents with bad grades or a silly little fear like that how could I ever trust them with me struggling with my self-worth and gender indentity? I couldn't and I still can't. There is one small and mundane memory from my childhood that eerily relates to all of this. I remeber sitting at Costco with my parents eating lunch after we had finished shopping. I dont remember what we were talking about but I can remember like it was yesterday turning to my mother and saying ""I don't have any self confidence"" while this was true even when I was very young I shouldn't have been thinking this way but what I shouldn't have gotten in response but did anyways was the short phrase from my mother ""No you don't, and thats your fault."" This is the person that Zairen is. This is the person I am. This is why I am the way I am. While people have struggled much more than I have much of this is my own fault for not standing up for myself its the way it is. However, this is not the person I want to be. I want to become a better person for myself and I want to prove my family wrong. I want to be stronger and more confident. I want to be able to stand up for and teach the next generation of people dealing with the same stuff I've had to deal with. I want to make sure that one day no one will have to go though the same stuff I did. I want to become me, Zairen.",genderfluid,"An angry, depressed, and humiliated genderqueer's manifesto",1526128586.0,"{'created_utc': 1526103386, 'id': '8iu3f1', 'num_comments': 3, 'score': 3, 'selftext': 'My name is Zairen and I\'m a 19 year old genderfluid college student in Minnesota. I was assigned male at birth with the name Zachary. I\'ve only recently come out to more of my friends but not to my family yet. I struggle with what is most likely depression and stress problems on a daily basis. I also deal with constant intrusive thoughts that range of self mockery to self harm and even suicide. I have a large problem with call of the void whenever doing something dangerous or has the potential for danger. When driving a vehicle there is constant thoughts just to swerve my car into an oncoming vehicle or somekind of building or pole. While I really don\'t have the urge myself to die it has become hard sometimes to seperate what thoughts are mine. On the outside to anyone that doesn\'t know what I\'m going through I appear perfectly fine if not just a little somber. Even getting up is a struggle for me. It takes a good 2 to 3 hours before Im actually up. Doing homework is especially a struggle. I always have a little voice in the back of my head telling me that I should just give up and to quit. A lot of times I do end up listening to this voice and it hurts a lot. Because of my mental state happiness is a momentary situation backed by sadness and depression. The joy someone would get from their birthday or some other kind of positive event lasts maybe a few hours at best. Every moment is filled with self doubt and self hatred. Even when my best friends in the world do something positive for me I always have the suspicion that they are only doing it to appear for my own sake instead of out of actual kindness. Under the same train of thought I always think I\'m some kind of burden upon those around me. I\'m hyper aware of the way people percieve me and my presence to the point that I assume people automatically dislike my presence.\n\nFor me my gender identity is a curse and a blessing compared to many in the LGBT community. As a cis-passing person I don\'t have to worry about any kind of discrimination unless I make it publicly known what my gender identity is. I\'m also lucky that as a genderfluid my disphoria is relatively small compared to other people. However, my identity is also a curse. Because of the fact that I can pass without out any work as a cis-male and I\'m not ""fully trans"" acceptance by those in the LGBT community is difficult. I often feel like my identity isnt legitimate and that I\'m appropriating the culture of those that have struggled more than I have.\n\nI wish I was able to list positive things about myself but I somehow lack this ability. When trying to do so I automatically shun myself for being narcacisstic. With any kind of positive thought I find something negative to replace it with. Did good on a paper? THen I have to remind myself that I hate my body or that I\'m some kind of failure that doesn\'t have a passion for anything. This lack of passion for anything is quite true though. I hold little passion or care for anything besides others. When it comes to careers or myself its next to impossible to make myself care. I could be someone\'s shoulder to cry on and be able to help solve their problems but I can barely drag myself to class or see a therapist. When I look at myself in the mirror I see a fat, short, dumb, ginger boy. When I look at myself I see failure, disappointment, and a waste of life. Despite not wanting to die I care very little for my well being beyond eating and bathing.\n\nDuring all of this my biggest help was been my boss and friend Carter. They have helped me figure out and become comfortable with my identity. Carter is one of the few if not the only person I feel comfortable talking about anything personal with anymore. I can\'t talk to my parents about anything and Im terrified of other authority figures whether it be teachers, assistants, or therapists. This why I\'m terrified of not being able to continue going to Morris. If can\'t come anymore I won\'t have a rock anymore. While my other friends have been accepting of my identity they either don\'t understand or can\'t relate fully. If I go to ARCC than I won\'t have this kind of community. If I stay at home then all I have to look forward to is verbal bullying by my parents, working constantly, and stayig in my room for the rest of the time. I may have the possibility of seeing a counselor but what good does that bring me when I have to go right back to the home which causes me so much stress and anxiety. At home I have little reason to exist or be a person. During high school I would next to always be in my room paying video games. Asking to see friends was not a right but a privelge. Of course that was when I was still in high school and not a legal adult. But now that I can be my own person with a few calls to declare myself independent why am I so terrified? Why don\'t I struggle with the idea of leaving the people that tried to raise a genius child that only grew up to disappoint them? Why I am I afraid to leave the home that mocked me for my anxiety issues when I was afraid the world was going to end. Why am I afraid to leave the home which I can\'t even associate any positive memoryies, a home that is just a house and nothing more, not even a real home. Why do I blame myself for all of this? Have I been lazy a bunch when it comes to solving my problems? Of course, but I shouldn\'t be afraid of just talking to someone that is wanting and willing to help. My parents are not the sole reason for this happening. Society at large played just as big of a role in me becoming the weak person I am if not bigger. But where were my parents during all of this trying to help me? Whenever I got bad grades in school they would constantly ask why I wasn\'t asking anyone for help. My answer was always I don\'t know which wasn\'t acceptable but I always knew deep down was that it was because I was afraid. In my sophmore year of highschool I finally decided to tell my parents the truth about a bad grade and that I needed help. My father was acepting but of course he had to tell my mother. as soon as I could hear her feeting pounding up the stairs I knew I wasn\'t going to be asking for help again. I was told to get out my spanish homework and to sit at the table. As soon as I did I was met with a hard slap against the back of the head which made my face fly towards the table. As I was crying my mother berated me for being a moron and that I wasn\'t going to amount to anything. This was not the only time this happened, in fact, it happened many times throughout my life. The one that sticks with me the most was when my parents found out about my last report card in senior year. I had dropped and failed a class in pseo because of stress and not knowing how to get help. As soon as they saw it I was hit in the face and knocked out of the chair I was sitting in. The same one I had been hit in during my sophmore year. I was told to stand up and when I did I was met with the same kind of verbal abuse I\'ve been hit with before. What was different about this time was the physicality I faced. Instead of just the usual slaps I was met with punches to the body and kicks to the legs that were thrown with enough force that I ended up on the ground in tears. This is no where representative of the normal state of the household. Normally thingd go on just fine without a hitch but there was always an underlying feeling of tension ad uneasiness. What made the house particularily bad were the bad times. There were no different levels of anger, it was either a 0 or a 10 nothing inbetween. My parents were my own bullies. Everything I did was used against me whether it be my acne, my weight, or the people I associated with. I was simply never good enough. \n\nThis behavior at home transfered heavily in school. I lacked any confidence in anything I was doing and hated people that were even slighty better than me. I learned quickly that the only was I would make it through school was being invisible and making as little of a splash as possible. I didn\'t want people to know me or be friends with me. I wanted to sit alone in silence at lunch and disappear into the sea of people and be nothing with everything. At the same time I began to question my gender identity which made me want to hide even more as I didn\'t even understand myself at that point. What made this especially worse is that I grew up in a heavily conservative area where people were both openly homophobic and transphobic. I thought I was less than human, a monster if anything. this is where my intrusive thoughts began. On a constant basis my mind was swarming itself that it was worthless and didn\'t deserve to live. If I had lived in a different household I could have gone to my parents for help and acceptance and I would have been in a way better place than I would be now. But instead I know I would have been openly mocked. Only a few years prior I had deceloped a strong fear of the world ending at the end of the Mayan calendar. Was it silly? definelty, but I was terrified. I struggled with sleeping and eating to the point it started affecting my grades. I eventually started seeing a counselor at school but soon stopped when my parents found out and began mocking me for it and acting as if I done someting wrong. If I couldn\'t trust my parents with bad grades or a silly little fear like that how could I ever trust them with me struggling with my self-worth and gender indentity? I couldn\'t and I still can\'t. There is one small and mundane memory from my childhood that eerily relates to all of this.

Background:
37 AMAB, broke through some fear walls in my head about a week ago and still picking up the pieces. Moving between she/her and they/them with occasional fits of he/him in my head self-gendering. I seem to have very little control over this.

The only major Pop culture version of my name is the computer from 2001: A Space Odyssey and, while HAL has a masculine voice, they are just a glowing red eye and action wise don't tend to skew one gender or another. Also, I'm a programming teacher with an active interest in AI so that helps me stay attached to the name.

My name at birth is Halsted -- an old family name. It came from my great-grandfather and the only other person I've ever heard of having the name is a woman in San Francisco. I really like and respect the history and care associated with picking my name, but I also feel some distance from it.

I've been trying on the name Hallie recently socially.

When I was a kid, I had strong negative reactions be being called Howie or Hallie at least in part as a result of knowing this info.

I now kindof feel like reclaiming it, and it feels good to wear. It also feels somewhat gendered f but not overly so. How does it hit other folk in their intuitive sense?


I'm afraid:
1) That I'll hate it a month after I get everyone calling me that
2) I'll end up feeling too distant from my self and end up creating traumatic rifts in my self-id that I'll need to heal later
3) It will feel right when I feel she/her and not when I feel they/them - he/himish and I'll end up confusing the crap out of everyone around me if I'm feeling different genders over the course of a day. Also, is this a thing?

Here are 3 from me: 

I am thankful for my health, because it opens endless possibilities for jobs, travel, and fun activities. 

I am thankful for my life partner, who grounds and supports me, no matter how batshit off the wall I go. I don't know If I will ever meet a person as brutally honest and patient as him again. He's always my support and strength.
:) 


I am thankful for the financial abundance in my life. I have a steady paycheck that takes care of my expenses, food, etc. 
I am blessed to be among those who aren't drowning in expenses and debts at the end of each month. We live paycheck to paycheck, but all of our needs and some basic wants sre always taken care of. :)

They didn't really say anything, just changed the topic back to the pizza after a short pause. But that's the first time I've come out to anyone fully outside of my family and a very few fellow gays and queers I know.

2018-05-30 19:52:50,8nbnhg,1,2,"What is gender normative dressing? in different regions, times etc. the gender norms would be very different. so in the grand scheme of things (catastrophes, eons etc) really we are worrying about nothing. 

but i how about your ego - if you really don't care about what somebody thinks then you would dress how the hell you would like and present yourself in any way that took your fancy. such as naked, filthy, dressed in a sheet. 

so there it is - its about ego and how we want others to react to us. we want others to react to us in a way that aligns with our expectations. so if we feel that a bit of male banter is expected, then if we behave in a way that elicits male banter, then we might expect to get it. if we don't, we might feel that we should dress a bit more masculine in order elicit that feeling.
Or perhaps we might hope that females would be more comfortable around us and trust us a little more if we are a little more feminine as we ourselves don't feel that combative Male behaviour to be valuable.

So its about social interaction because without any other humans, we really dont feel these social related feelings. If i were deserted on an island with no human contact its unlikely i would get turned on dressing like a cute little cosplay vixen. unless i drew on memories of society. (an island of cosplay vixens isn't such a bad thought to dwell on)...

But im not, im living in a fucking complex society and its feeling difficult to make sense of it. i just know that if i dress in a way that in compelled to (leafing through my wifes wardrobe) i will find my day rather difficult.

bollocks.
