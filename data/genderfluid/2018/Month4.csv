2018-04-01 21:28:31,88u660,20,14,"Please tell me if this is the wrong subreddit, first time posting here. Sorry for the clickbait-y title.

I was born male but ever since I was around 14 (19 now) I've been confused about my gender. I've done small bits of cross-dressing (trying female underwear, wearing women's clothing) and whenever I see a cute girl I think she's attractive but also that I wish I could be her but as I'm still confused I don't want to announce I'm all this or that just yet because I just don't know.

A few years ago I researched gender terms and their meanings and came across ""genderfluid"" and thought I was beginning to understand these feelings I'd been having as sometimes I feel male and masculine but also female &amp; feminine.

On to last night, I went around to see my two friends ""B"" (19/F) &amp; her boyfriend ""R"" (21/M). We got on to the topic of Germaine Greer and her view that Trans-women aren't real women. I strongly oppose this view and believe they are just as much women as cis-women are. Us three have had conversations about gender before and I'm strongly for any gender identity or expression a person may have, B &amp; R think the opposite, B especially thinks  that society's got out of hand and that there are only males &amp; females and that your genitalia automatically denotes your gender. 

B accepts that trans-women want to be women as that's how they feel but at the same time doesn't think believe they're real women. After explaining that I have a cousin that is Agender I blurted out that I'm confused about my gender and that I can feel both male &amp; female. B laughed at me and asked if I had a penis to which I said yes to which she said well then you're a guy then there's no question. 

R just sat there pretty much. After this exchange between B &amp; I I felt uncomfortable, offended and left. I still feel upset about it today so I called my sister (24/F) whose really understanding and open-minded about these things and she calmed me down and said to possibly write B a text explaining how I feel.

What do you think about the conversation I had with B? What would you do in my situation?

P.S. I'm in the UK &amp; I just wondered if anyone genderfluid on here has been to The Tavistock &amp; Portman's gender clinic? If so, what was your experience because I've only read stories from transpeople.

2018-04-04 23:06:21,89ujjk,6,15,"Okay, this is really just me wanting to make sure that I'm not going crazy from overthinking this. I'm not saying I discovered it in the best way possible, but I discovered that my sexuality can kinda shift with how feminine I'm feeling. I discovered this while being a bit explicit on Omegle. I am AMAB and consider myself generally either a feminine guy or a genderqueer demigirl.

My gender identity is rarely at ""man"" mode. When it is at ""man"" I cannot for one second even fathom being with a man. Like, the thought just doesn't cross my mind at all. When I am ""man,"" which is rare, I am a straight man and kinda vanilla at that level.

Generally my identity is kinda androgynous, I'm okay with being addressed as a man though I'm more feminine internally. When I am like this, I can be okay with being a bit sexual FOR a man but I doubt I could be sexual WITH a man. With a woman, or a feminine person, I could see being a bit more kinky and being up for anal penetration and other more typically feminine associated positions, but still being a bit more vanilla.

Now, when I am feeling like a woman, that is when I can get very kinky and be into all sorts of things. I want to be fucked. I want to be all over the other person. I want to have the other person do whatever they want to me. When I am like this, while I would probably prefer a more feminine person (doesn't have to be a woman) I could see being with the right man as well and riding him and just letting him treat me completely like a girl.

Like, to put it more simply, using a bar hook-up analogy...when I'm feeling like a man I only want women and only want vanilla sex, when I am feeling more neutral I am open for more kinky sex and more open to non-binary feminine people, but when I am feeling more like a woman I become a LOT more kinky and expressive and feel a lot more open to being with men.",genderfluid,Sexuality shifting with gender identity?

2018-04-08 05:11:15,8anyf0,7,7,"So about a week ago now I decided to try a give the title ""genderfluid"" a feel, if that makes sense. It felt good the first few days, like things I felt started to make sense, but then I started doubting.. And with doubt came frantic googling and with that came even more confusion and doubt. 
For 18 years I've identified as a cis female, when I questioned my sexuality I was able to easily say ""I'm pan"", but this? Gender?? It's so much more than that. Do I need dysphoria? Do I HAVE dysphoria?? Am I just overreacting? How do I know i'm not just gender nonconforming? 
My entire life it's been ""Well she has two brothers! Of course she's a little boyish"" which I just went along with. Sometimes i'd look at myself and wish I had parts I didn't but I simply brushed it off to be nothing. This was all ok, identifying as a cis female, until I shaved my hair.. I went from over 3 feet of hair that i'd always accidentally sit on, to half an inch buzz cut because the entire night and next morning I just wanted it all gone. That's when it all started, if I had to pinpoint a specific time.
The feelings of wanting parts there that weren't got stronger (to the point where i'd have to say it to friends/family in a joking manner because I couldn't get it out of my head otherwise), the way I dressed became much more.. Defined? One day it could be a very obvious masculine look, the other extremely feminine, and some just.. Kinda like I threw together something in a half asleep daze haha. 
I don't even know if i'm making sense anymore. My mind is a mess and trying to look into articles and videos only makes me more confused.
I know a gender therapist could help, I mean I just need one in general cause my mental illnesses, but that's something that will take me a while to get and I don't have time with how loud my mind is being about this.

Would.. Buying a packer be wasteful at this point, since i'm not even sure?? My big issue isn't my chest, that I can easily flatten with a sports bra, it's what's between my legs.

2018-04-10 18:04:08,8b9tlm,4,18,"First off I'm sorry, I know this question is almost impossible to answer in words.

I was assigned male at birth. Eventually accepted I was a crossdresser, realized it was more and labled myself bigender, then eventually labled myself a transwoman. I identified as a trans woman for quite some time, maybe around 9 months or so? Recently I've been feeling masculine identification coming back and ive actively wanted to experience it again. It hasn't been distressing in any way except for the fact that I'm now requestioning my gender identity. I have an appointment to start hormones at the end of the month and now I'm not entirely sure if that's right for me, but I'm still going to start them and see how it feels. I'm currently in a place where I really want to know for sure what my gender identity is but I've accepted that all I can know is how I feel day to day and maybe one day I'll have a concrete answer. 

Even when I was identifying as transfemme, saying I was a woman sounded a little off. I know for sure I'm not cisgender and so I don't think these feelings of masculinity are coming from a place of internalized transphobia. I'm currently exploring the fluidity of my gender or if I'd fit better in my own gender that is a combination of things from both sides of the spectrum. Even recently both my female and male names have just sounded like of off, and a more neutral name like Taylor or Alex is appealing to me. I'm the type of person who, when I find something new that I like, I dive into it 110%. Which makes me think that I identified as transfemme because the feminine side of me was a new experience and I wanted all of it. Now that I've lived that way for a while I'm thinking I might be getting back to baseline and actually fall somewhere in between or outside the gender spectrum.

So for those of you who are gender fluid, bigender, or non-binary, what is it like? How did you know?

It may be important to add that I openly present anywhere along the male to female spectrum, sometimes wanting to be closer to one side than the other. Even at the height of feeling femme, I was very happy just presenting femme in public and didn't really have an inner desire to have my body be that of a woman's. Generally I can be pretty happy in a mixed state, so like combining male and female clothing, while wearing makeup and nail polish and using my male voice or having some stubble. 

In terms of the effects from hormones my main desire would be less body hair and better skin, but breasts are fully neutral to me with no appeal or dislike. And honestly I think one of the biggest things I hoped to get from physically transitioning would be getting rid of depression which to me doesn't sound like it should be the main reason to transition, because if I was still depressed after I wouldn't be satisfied with the transition.",genderfluid,What does it feel like to be gender fluid/non-binary/bigender?,1523408648.0,"{'created_utc': 1523383448, 'id': '8b9tlm', 'num_comments': 4, 'score': 18, 'selftext': ""First off I'm sorry, I know this question is almost impossible to answer in words.\n\nI was assigned male at birth.

2018-04-20 22:53:27,8drqqf,0,29,"I can't believe I'm here writing this as a 35 male.  3 months ago, I don't think I even knew the term gender fluid, never mind thought it applied to me.  It does.  In these last 3 months, I've started seeing a new therapist on a regular basis.  Not even for any gender issues.  Simply due to issues in other parts of my life.  My feminine side and cross dressing came up though, mostly because I did notice that one of her areas of expertise was LGBT.   Cross dressing has been a tiny tiny part of my life since I was in single digits, but not a significant part, not a part I felt I needed to talk about, and not a part I thought I needed to get more from.  I was wrong.  It's like I've been given permission (from my therapist), though not literally.  I said I like labels, so we talked about it, and gender fluid fits for me.  Since then, I've embraced it.  So much embraced it.  

I used to steal some of my wife's clothes, tank tops, panties, socks, leggings, etc.  She'd give me a hard time about it in a light hearted way, and said she thought I was gay.  I'm not gay, and I know she's evolved enough to know cross dressing and being gay are not related, so it was just a funny conversation for us and an easy way to brush off the cross dressing.  When she wasn't around, I'd go a little further with the cross dressing, and I've probably tried on every single thing in her closet at least once.  One time I even went all the way, went full female with wig and makeup, and went out in public to get a massage at an Asian place that felt like a safe zone because they didn't speak great English.  It went really well, and I didn't feel judged (doubt I was convincing as female though - make up is hard!).  I guess I didn't have a name then, but now it's Ella :)

It was always about more than the cross dressing.  Everyone always talks about my feminine side, and I've been called metro sexual.  I'm sensitive, would rather talk about emotions than make small talk, my best friends were always girls, and I had a hard time relating to guys unless they were also on the feminine side or gay.  I just didn't fit the guys guy mold at all.  Someone said something that stuck with me too; that it makes sense that some people want to be what they're enamored with.  In my case, wanting to be female sometimes.

My therapist is my heaven.  She is perfect for me, and we have clicked in an unbelievable way.  Since seeing her, I've had a little conversation with my wife about it, and though I felt like I held back a little in explaining my desires (I'll get there), she was totally cool with me describing myself as gender fluid.  I've worn female clothes around her since, more than normal, and she hasn't had the same jab at me; maybe even went a little crazy (in the good way) with me wearing her panties one night.  I also came out to my best friend (female), who has been nothing but supportive, and I even told my regular massage therapist (another safe zone).  I reached out to a friend who transitioned from m2f a few years ago; I was totally supportive at the time, but never thought we'd have this in common.

This has just exploded for me.  I'm as excited about it as I have been about anything in ages.  I've realized this is important to me, and I want to share it in some small fashion and make it part of me.  Not all the way; not at work, not around my 3 kids, or family members.  I'm sure everyone would be supportive, but I don't have that desire at this time, and can't see myself getting there.  I am really embracing it though, and I'm not feeling guilty about it anymore.  I'm ready to experience new things; shaving my legs, make up, painting nails, buying girls clothes for myself for once, and not just for my wife.  Don't worry, she'll get new cute things too :)

2018-04-25 20:42:17,8ewx1c,11,4,"First off, hi, I’ve been thinking and thinking for a long time and I’m just so confused as to what I’m feeling and what I could be, so I hope I can get some advice. Forgive me, as I’m not the best writer, it’ll be a mess to read.

I’m 18, gay and AMAB. For around 3 years, I’ve been struggling with how I feel and what exactly I am. 

I don’t really have an issue with being seen as/referred to as he and male, and I think I would prefer it to stay that way, but I still get these weird unexplainable feelings that cause massive anxiety, when I think about this topic, so I don’t know what to do. I look down at my body and feel like something isn’t right, but I don’t know what, I wouldn’t rather have a femal body/figure though, as it just wouldn’t feel right to me. Honestly I sometimes feel like I’m not even human.

I wouldn’t say I’m particularly masculine or feminine, maybe leaning a bit more towards masculine (I’m not even sure how you’d determine what is), but sometimes, I don’t feel like I fit with Male label but I still have a little affinity with it, but then again this could be more of a social thing.

This is more of a physical thing, I’m not happy with how my body is, due to being overweight and generally unhealthy, I have some body hair but I’m neutral towards it, sometimes I wish it was more visable, others I don’t mind it. Although I do find it interesting to look at at times, I don’t think I’d like to remove all of it. 
In terms of my face, I don’t have much confidence in how I look, but it isn’t really due to looking male. As for my hair, I’m not sure if I would prefer longer or shorter, as I have only had it short, but I think long wouldn’t fit me as a guy.

As for my penis, I’m not sure, sometimes I’m fine with it, other times I’m not fine. Not sure if I’d want a vagina though. 

Sometimes I get a feeling in and around my chest and nipples, it’s kind of like a phantom breast thing, it’s that or my nipples could be rubbing against my shirt or maybe just my social anxiety. I’m not sure what this feeling means. 

On the rare occasion that I do see straight porn, I usually imagine myself as the girl, and how PIV sex would feel for me, I also rarely have sexual fantasies as a woman. Does this mean anything? With gay porn, I put myself in what position I feel like.

That’s all the feelings I can think of right now. I’m sorry it’s such a mess, and I probably sound crazy but I’m not sure how to get it all down coherently. I’m aware that I don’t need to label myself, but doing so would help me understand how I feel. The constant questioning is driving me crazy and piles on to my already existing anxiety and depression. A lot of the time, I can’t tell if I do feel this way, or my mind is just screwing with me, after all I tend to copy other people’s feelings without actually feeling that way.

I’d appreciate any help and I’m free to answer any questions you have. Thanks for reading.

2018-04-26 09:31:26,8f1cqb,14,8,"I'm gonna try to keep this simple...

Call me Chester. I was female at birth. Throughout my years I started feeling male as well. I feel uncomfortable in my body, but I don't want to permanently change it. I know there's ways around like binding and I've heard of some underwear that mimic having a penis. But here's the problem: I don't know what I am.

I've decided to stick with genderfluid because there are some days I feel very female, though I will never wear skirts or tank tops because I don't like how revealing they are on me. But then I feel extremely male and accidentally wound up naming that side of myself ""Chester"". I find that I feel male most of the time. Like 80% male and 20% female. Here's the second problem: I'm having a hard time accepting this side of me. Being a lesbian? Got it down. I'm totally fine with it.

I've also found out that I'm totally fine with being called he/him and I ADORE being called handsome and I would even go so far as to say if my girlfriend called me her ""boyfriend"" I'd be pretty ecstatic over it. I know one thing for sure, I am not trans. Because I do enjoy my woman body a lot of the time, and again, would never ever want a permanent change.

I've come to resent myself over this. My girlfriend does know about this, and she's been very supportive. It just frightens me to feel so out og place because I'm scared to make that first leap into buying a binder.
