2018-08-03 17:31:55,94bm2s,6,7,"So I'm a first timer to this subreddit but not to the confusion of gender. For awhile, I considered I might be trans, but I ended up figuring out that wasn't the case with me. It's more complex than that.

Physically I am male and present as one most of the time. I'm comfortable with that, but I also crossdress and have been doing so for years. Tried on tights when I was 12 and it was game over for me.

I suppose to a certain degree I am a bit fluid. I have a femme self and a femme name when I dress up. But I run into two major roadblocks. Number one: I'm not a big man and I can pass if my makeup is done well enough and I wear the right outfit. But the deep voice gives me away every time and it kind of kills the feminine vibe. Makes me feel like a huge fake. The second problem is something I've denied for years. I have a strong masculine and feminine side that I have a hard time balancing. When in skirts and a wig, it's hard for me to be around my male family and friends, not because they disapprove or would give me shit for it, but I feel like I'm betraying my masculine half so to speak. It's just very confusing at times.

Has anyone else experienced anything like this? I would love to get involved more with this community, even if I do consider myself male, I can't deny wanting to be a woman too at times.

I myself am genderfluid, but I feel like that's not my gender itself. When I am female, I feel my gender *is* female, when I am male, my gender *is* male, and when I am non-binary... you get the idea.

To me, using the term genderfluid means having a stable identity within an ever-changing identity that is my gender.

I am curious about how other genderfluid folks view being genderfluid. Do you see it as your gender? Do you see it as something that effects your preexisting gender?

2018-08-15 22:15:29,97mm66,2,9,"I've been thinking (and saying) rather a lot recently about how the need to transition might be rooted in the idea of _being_ some particular _thing_. Are we not falling short, maybe, saying ""yes, it's possible &amp; acceptible now to change from being some one _thing_ to another _thing_"". Would it not be a more complete liberation if we could simply establish _total freedom of expression_? 

I got importuned by a _chaser_ a few weeks ago - one of the unpleasant kind: he was convinced that _he_ was doing _me_ a favour by giving me the opportunity to give him a blow-job. I told him ""I'm not a _cum-slut_, you know"". His response to that was to say, with much irritation, ""well what are you then?"". Suddenly, I was _required_ to _designate_ myself under _his_ system that I do not abide by or recognise atall. I solved the problem by doing my _vague-dopey-mystical_ act at him - works every time!

But categories pervade _all_ our thinking - it's not just someone here or someone there, dividing people into _teams_, each according to his own little scheme. Just try abolishing the need to categorise yourself - it has a certain way of sneaking back. There is a very great deal of purely  habitual _abiding by_ going on all-over the place. How about _just let people be_! instead. And I mean _literally_  just let them _be_! _Not_ just let them be _what they are_ - but just let them be. As soon as you append the 'what they are', you plant the seed from which the notion of categories grows all over again. 

I was talking about transitioning at first ... and haven't actually stopped, really. I have this fear that many people are being precipitated into this course precisely because of their not being _let be_. I am not denying the existence of persons who _truly_ choose that course. But I have a strong fear that there are many who are _taking_ it who have not truly _chosen_ it, in that they have come to hate, often with a white-hot bitterness, the _thing_ that they are, and perceive an opportunity to become a different _thing_, and in that opportunity discern their remedy ... whereas if they had just been _let be_ they would just have _been_.

People wonder sometimes why I crossdress. My answer - the _true_ answer that is - is that I don't: there is no such thing as _crossdressing_. There _is no such thing_ as crossdressing! Just let people be!

For the longest time, I thought maybe I was gay because I had overwhelming urges to give a friend head as a young teenager. And it happened often.

I don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs like sometimes, I‚Äôm internally more towards a feminine, submissive side, and I want to be used for pleasure. Other times, I want to fuck or make love to certain chicks with a raging passion, push their limits, and/or fuck them until they can‚Äôt walk straight. It all depends on who it is, and what kind of chemistry there is. 

I suppress all my feminine feelings and whatnot, and it‚Äôs really fucked me up. Like when I do mushrooms, I can feel it come forth, and it feels so good. But suppressing it, being ashamed of it,  and never talking about it has had a negative outcome. 

Like with my ex girlfriend, she was the first, of fifteen chicks, that I had truly had sex with and made love to. From the moment I saw her, I knew we‚Äôd wind up in deep shit. The sex was, and still is, absolutely incredible.

But there‚Äôs a side of me that so badly wants to be used strictly for blowjobs. Like just pleasuring some guy with a huge cock. Letting him force my head down, his cock all the way down my throat, let him thrust in my mouth, like literally; however he sees it fit to use my face. And I also wouldn‚Äôt mind being mounted and fucked, at all. It all comes down to being used for pleasure, and that‚Äôs it.

I experimented with a co-worker once, he was very feminine, I wasn‚Äôt into it. That‚Äôs as far as I‚Äôve gone with any guy.

And all this is driving me insane. I believe it‚Äôs where my drinking and substance abuse problem stems from. My mother was the exact same way, was into both men and women, some people claim she was a lesbian. She‚Äôd never admit to it. She holed up in her room for the better part of thirty years, she was hateful when she drank, she had no control over herself, and eventually drank herself to death.

**SAPPY TIME**

Thank you guys, girls and every gender in between or out of the spectrum.  You helped me realize that I do pass well. Before I was on this subreddit I thought the hair extensions were horrible. I felt invalid but You guys have helped me realize the opposite. I *am* valid and so are all of you; no matter what you identify as youare valid. You are worth it. While you may go really low at points you will come back. So please, please, don't hurt yourself others and stay alive. You might not realize how much you mean to someone. I know the feeling of wanting to end it all but I also know the feeling of loosing someone close to you. I just lost one of my closest friends about 7 hours ago. Someone who welcomed me to my new school. Someone who made me feel welcome. Someone who befriended the wierd new kid. My mom used to read me this book when I was a baby called,No matter What: it was great because it is about a mom who would love her son no matter what he was. No matter what, everyone has someone. Mom, dad, brother, sister, friend, person online. I love each and every one of you. If you need support please feel free to contact me I will do my best to respond. The genderfluid community is small enough already and I don't want to loose anymore genderfluid people.

I'm interested to hear the variety of stories and accounts from genderfluid or folks whose gender fluctuates. I've provided a small form to fill out, out of curiosity and to help compile some info. It would mean a lot to me, personally, to see these responses. I'm having trouble gauging what genderfluid means or can mean, so I know others are too. 

So you feel comfy talking to me: I'm agender, I recently have been IDing along the lines of greygender (neutral oriented gender that can shift) or agenderflux (gender that has a base in agender but shifts outwards and back). I work in arts writing, specifically documenting intersectional feminism and marginalization in contemporary craft.   


Feel free to leave things you're uncomfortable sharing blank - these are suggestions.  


**Age Range:** Minor (17 and under); 18-25; 25-35; 35-50; 50+  
**Identity/ies:** Gender and Sexuality labels, ex. nonbinary, agender, trans, asexual, etc.  
**Do you have a ""base"" gender that you fluctuate outwards from?:** y/n  
Example: I generally feel that I lack a gender and my shifts/fluctuations go towards masculinity and return to my base of agender.   
**Is your fluidity binary or nonbinary or something else?:** binary / nonbinary / other  
Example: My friend shifts gender feelings from girl to boy, along the gender binary, whereas I shift along neutral to masculine, in a nonbinary manner. I know others who shift from feminine to faelike, which could identify as neither binary nor nonbinary.  
**Does your gender shift due to presentation?** y/n  
Example: Although I never get ""natural"" shifts towards feminine, if I wear skirts and makeup, I often perform feminine and my gender can shift to feminine because of it.   
**Does your gender shift consistently across time? Daily / weekly / monthly?** \[varied answers\]  
Example: You might wake up as a different gender every day, or change genders multiple times throughout one day. Or, you may only get shifts infrequently one or two days a month.

Something they can just take

Some days I feel so afraid I can‚Äôt do anything

I hid in my seat
I shake and sweat and breathe

But the Lord if I just turned to the Lord
It would all be okay

Isn‚Äôt real
Truth is that there‚Äôs nothing in the world

That could make this any less real

But if I just stopped worrying
If I used your eucalyptus spray, your anti stress balm
I‚Äôd be okay

But I don‚Äôt feel okay but they say I am
If I just keep moving, if I just look
Look down at myself, a robot

2018-08-22 17:26:28,99fal9,6,3,"Hi, ive been lurking here for a while but never posted until now. 

The second person I came out to was my roommate. He's a guy ive known since high school, and weve continued to be friends into our late 20s, and we now live in the same apartment. Im assigned male, but have been out as genderfluid to a handful of close friends for a few months, and i crossdress as a woman in private. One time when i was dressed up, i decided on impulse that i would tell my roommate, that it would come up eventually anyway. I sent him a text to give him a little warning, and i was still dressed when he got home. His initial reaction seemed supportive and positive, but I soon saw that there were problems under the surface. After I came out to him he avoided me for 3 days. When i next came home from work, he hugged me as i walked in, but also explained that he needed time to wrap his head around this. I didnt know how to interpret that, so I partially went back into the closet when I was around him (which is often, since we live under the same roof).

As the months went on, I was feeling restless to do more with my crossdressing, to hang out as a woman with some of my friends who ive told. Before I said anything about this, my roommate approached me and partially apologized, saying hed done some more research and he had changed his attitude on genderfluidity. He said he mistakenly believed that my crossdressing was a ""fetish that [I] was involving [him] in"", which was why hed been weird about it, but now he wanted to be more supportive. So, i thought that meant things were looking up, and that i could be more open around him. 

Then last weekend, a friend of ours was performing at a local bar, and i had an idea that maybe i would go as a woman, since all of my friends who were going were people who already knew about me. But id never gone in public before and I was extremely nervous. I didnt know whether it was selfish of me to hijack this existing plan for revealing myself. My roommate was not going to this event, so i knocked on his door (while halfway changed into womens clothing) because i wanted to ask his advice. He cut me off before i could finish and told me ""I cant make that decision for you"" in a tone that made me think he saw this as an inappropriate question. I said ""ok"", shrank back into my room, changed back into male clothes, and went out as a guy. I felt really hurt, that it had felt like he had been dusgusted by me.

Over the next few days, he was noticeably colder towards me, and last night he passed me in the hall looking right at me,  ignored me when I said hi, and shut the door to his room. I texted him asking if he wanted to talk and i could tell something was wrong. He didnt reply. Earlier today, after radio silence all night, I asked if I could at least ask whether this was about my gender? It was; he sent me a really long angry text about how it was out of line for me to have asked him for advice on sunday, and how ""as we had discussed"" (no we didnt) he was fine with me doing whatever i wanted as long as I didnt involve him, and he called this being ""supportive"". He said he'd overlook it because he could see i had been feeling vulnerable that day, but that this couldnt happen again. 

Now I feel shocked and even more hurt. He seems to have this idea that I can just isolate the genderfluid part of myself and keep it away from him, or that if I show it in any capacity Ill be infecting him or something. I didnt say anything in reply to his text except ""id like to talk about this tonight"". 

So here i am. I guess I just want to know if anyone had advice on how to deal with people in your life who clearly arent as open-minded as they think they are, and if theres any way I can help him understand. Or, am i wrong and is his request for me to hide my female side around him reasonable?",genderfluid,Need Advice on Dealing with Roommate,1534983988.0,"{'created_utc': 1534958788, 'id': '99fal9', 'num_comments': 6, 'score': 3, 'selftext': 'Hi, ive been lurking here for a while but never posted until now. \n\nThe second person I came out to was my roommate.

They came out to me in full garb/dress, two weeks after signing a year long lease into our second year of living together. I was uncomfortable. Immediately I expressed that I'd be supportive in their decisions, that they are the same person, and it doesn't really affect me which is true.  I'm struggling to believe my own words. This person is naturally sensitive so I knew immediately that I needed to choose my words wisely and only show support.  I then asked them if they wanted to sit and watch a movie at home. We did. I felt incredibly uncomfortable.

I only wanted to show support because otherwise you're a villain. That's fact. I didn't' let any of my personal beliefs known because I didn't think my opinion would add anything beneficial and only serve to hurt. I'm not comfortable. I don't think that support and comfort are the same thing. I think I can be supportive and uncomfortable at the same time. 

I just don't want added drama in my life or to be involved with any decision making. Everybody has their own issues and i'm not involving them in any of mine because that would be unfair to burden someone else with my issues. I thought I expressed this over a few talks. I don't feel qualified to offer my opinions in case they negatively affect this person. 

The other night they told me they were thinking about going out as a female that night. I said i don't want to weigh in. I'm not answering. They came to me the other day saying that due to that encounter they chose not to change that night. 

I think that's entirely unfair. It feels like I'm involved in a relationship I didn't sign up for. I told them again that I'm uncomfortable in offering advice. Exactly what I was trying to avoid happened.  I keep telling them that those decisions cant come from me and i'm not available to give them my opinion and that my opinion doesn't matter anyway it needs to come from inside them. 

I've pretty consistently said something along the lines of the following when asked what I Think: ""Fuck my opinion, I can't tell you what to do as much as you can control the color of my eyes. It shouldn't matter to you what I think. You pay rent like I do. I don't control any of your actions. You don't control any of mine. I have no power over you. ""

I'm not comfortable being used as a stepping stone for their bravery, because when they lack the courage to be what they want then I'll get blamed. I feel like that already happened. 

They mentioned me acting distant and cold when they even approach the subject. I know they inject a lot of their own fears and imagination into scenarios like this. For instance we went to see a movie in public and they wore earrings. They took them off after the movie. They told me yesterday they blamed me for not talking to them during the movie and that also affected his decision.  I didn't say anything...because we're in a fucking movie! That's one of my all time pet peeves and they know this. No phones and no talking. I literally just paid for that time. Again I think this is entirely unfair to blame me for their feelings. I have no idea what to do .

They asked me if i'd be comfortable going to an event with our friends with them as a female.  I honestly don't think I would. But I lied. Because otherwise I'm the villain. It shouldn't matter what I think!

I'm trying to educate myself, I'm trying to be supportive, but I'm not comfortable. There's nothing to do, no actions to take.

2018-08-31 13:44:30,9btq69,10,15,"Hi everyone! I have a bunch of questions I want to ask. I hope you don't mind if they're a little basic, but I really want to hear the experiences and stuff of other genderfluid people.

First off, HRT. I found a doctor in my area with a reputation of being really helpful to trans people wanting HRT (like in and out with an E or T prescription). I'm not sure if HRT is for me though. Some days, I look in the mirror and like (or at least don't mind) what I see in the mirror. Other days, I really wish I looked more fem. I'm worried that HRT might just flip those days, or worse, just make me disappointed that I don't look fem enough and that I don't look masc enough. For those of you who have pursued HRT, did you feel like it helped you fell more confident/comfortable with yourself? Is there any advice/things you wish you had known?

My next question is kind of about names. I have a masc name and a fem name, and I really like both. Switching back and forth seems like a hassle, both for me and for everyone who needs to address me. Would you recommend just finding a gender neutral name to use? I'm not keen on switching my names around, but I'm not sure what other solution there would be.

Last question (for now) is about professionalism. How do you manage your gender in the workplace or during a job search? Do you keep the fluidity hidden and just present one way or another? I guess, how do you handle that while trying to be professional?

Sorry if these questions are basic, but I feel so lost and confused. Sometimes I wish I was just cis or a transwoman so I could just slot myself into an established gender and call it good.
