2018-09-05 20:55:30,9dav78,3,14,"I feel like I need to get healthy first. I let myself go after a long depressive episode. So my feminine body is even more exaggerated and noticeable. 

99.9% of people automatically see me as a cisgender woman and straight. I came out last year as biromantic ace. Though part of me wonders if being ace stems from internalized phobias. 

I'm getting ready to graduate from college. And as much as I love my major in psychology, the field itself is notorious for being hesitant to admit to grad school or hire people who don't follow societal norms or have/have had mental illness. So seeing as it's my last year here, and I'll be interviewing for programs and jobs, it may not be in my best interest to start experimenting now. On the other hand though, college is one of the best places to explore and discover yourself.

Part of me even feels like I'm not allowed to explore anything. That I should just accept me for me. But then that feeling comes back, and I know something isn't right.

The feeling I get comes in waves and varies in intensity. I don't mind being female in some ways, but I don't exactly love it either. I never understood the whole concept of feeling and accepting your womanhood. I also don't feel like a man either. Which is kinda strange to me because I've always thought I'd be happier if I were a man. It's like, I sometimes feel like a man, but not a whole man. I'm okay with me, I just sometimes wish I was different. 

It seems to change all the time though. I'm often just okay with me, me as in me, not my body, just wanting to get healthy overall (myself and body) again. I hate my body in most of it's aspects. And I unfortunately started an unhealthy drinking habit as a way of punishing myself. It also doesn't help that the drinks make my mind looser, and I feel more like myself.

Growing up, I was a very different person. A spoiled brat who held their parents' beliefs (religious and conservative) to a T. Once I got to college and moved out, I started changing and just grew up. I'm very different from who I used to be. 

This brings me to the name thing. I'm not the old Emma. I don't even feel like I am Emma anymore. People say that name in reference to me and my first thought is ""who's that?"". My family has made nicknames for me for years, most of them mocking names, and all formed from my given name. They don't care that it's insulting and hurtful to have your own name hurled out in another form, an insulting version of the name. It doesn't feel like Emma is my name anymore. I don't feel like Emma anymore.

I feel like a name change is in order. I may not be ready to explore in other ways, but I think I am ready when it comes to making a new me. A name. And new style. To make myself feel more confident that I can be me, that I'm not tied down to my family and hometown. Maybe then I'll start to feel safer in exploring gender. 

I don't want friends to start asking why I'm changing, but at the same time I want them to know part of it. I'm not ready to talk about pronouns or gender. But the things with my family I think I can tell, and it'll cover the name change. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess this is my first time saying hello as Jay.

I'm not male or female, at least not that I know of yet. I'm content to just be somewhere in the middle. Some days I'll feel more of one than the other, most days will just be in-between.

My name is Ezra Morris and I am a graduate student from the psychology department at Towson University. I am writing to invite you to participate in a research study about the subtle positive and negative messages received during therapy/counseling as experienced by those with a gender identity that differs from which they were assigned at birth.

If you decide to participate in this study, you will be asked to recount both subtle positive and negative experiences that you have had in therapy/counseling because of your gender identity. Contact information for emotional support services will be provided at the end of the survey, should you need them.

In order to participate, you must be at least 18 years of age and have a gender identity that does not match that of which you were assigned at birth. In addition, you must have attended therapy/counseling within the last 5 years while identifying as a gender (or lack thereof) that does not match that of which you were assigned at birth, or while exploring your gender identity. Your gender identity does NOT have to be the reason for/focus of your attendance.

Participation is completely voluntary and should take about 10 minutes to complete. If you have any questions about the study, please contact me at [kmorri27@students.towson.edu](mailto:kmorri27@students.towson.edu), message me here, or leave a comment.

I am writing to invite you to participate in a research study about the subtle positive and negative messages received during therapy/counseling as experienced by those with a gender identity that differs from which they were assigned at birth.\n\nIf you decide to participate in this study, you will be asked to recount both subtle positive and negative experiences that you have had in therapy/counseling because of your gender identity. Contact information for emotional support services will be provided at the end of the survey, should you need them.\n\nIn order to participate, you must be at least 18 years of age and have a gender identity that does not match that of which you were assigned at birth. In addition, you must have attended therapy/counseling within the last 5 years while identifying as a gender (or lack thereof) that does not match that of which you were assigned at birth, or while exploring your gender identity. Your gender identity does NOT have to be the reason for/focus of your attendance.\n\nParticipation is completely voluntary and should take about 10 minutes to complete.

2018-09-11 01:41:18,9et6vb,2,10,"Brief background - 39, M, married for years w/o kids, corporate VP. Generally successful and happy with my current life situation. However, secretly always conflicted about gender identity, particularly since until the last few years didn't even know there was a terminology for what I felt. From a young age, been fascinated with female body and female clothing - initially thought it was some kind of fetish or just the stirrings of horny young maleness. But as time passed I realized it was just as much admiration, if not occasional envy that women could wear beautiful things and be graceful swishing about, while I was locked into the relatively narrow image and design choices of manhood. 

I live in a country where sexual and gender identity has for the longest time been influenced by religion and outdated traditional viewpoints. Gay men and transgender men, for instance, are generally lumped together as ""boys who want to be girls"", with matching derogatory terminology. Lesbians versus transgender women likewise. So it was confusing growing up; I knew I wasn't gay although I've been able to appreciate the handsomeness of other men, and my attraction has pretty much always run towards women. But sometimes that attraction, wanting to be with a woman, would spill over to wanting to BE that woman, to have her long hair and smooth skin and soft curves, to wear a colorful dress and cute shoes... ah well. 

Went out once with a woman who was open-minded about it and possibly genderqueer; she got me to put on one of her dresses (I was smaller than her) and I was surprised by how comfortable I felt in it, how right it seemed with a lovely large-rimmed hat on. Have had few such opportunities since to express that hidden part of myself.

Happy enough to be male most of the time; obvious advantages given the patriarchal society in which I live. Still, there are days when I wish I could be that someone else, even for a few hours, not even being with anyone - glad to be with my wife - just enjoying being that girl. 

I've sort of told one person, an old college friend, who is dear enough to accept everything about me as I do about her. Nobody else, not my wife, nor my family, nor anybody else I consider close, knows. Possibly my deepest, not-too-darkest secret.

But those who dismiss him almost never know a single thing about his sexual difference theory. Like that fact it is based on a complete reworking of Aristotelian logic, which he supplements with thinkers like Frege and Peirce and things like Russel's paradox.

And yes, dear reader, there are differences between the sexes. Of which he claims there are only two. Yet his theory is not a binary opposition. How can this be, you ask?

Well, to find out we have to turn to his infamous formulas of sexuation. They are notoriously difficult, as you may have heard. But it is more important to understand them today than ever before, what with the sudden proliferation of genders -- a phenomenon which is not subversive in the least. The power structures in our society are not touched in the slightest when men wear dresses and women grow beards. In fact, they are strengthened ten-fold. More market points to exploit. Marx was right, capital needs to expand and it needs an ideological structure to support that expansion. Which is why big corporations are the staunchest defenders of gender theory as a rule. The truly great French theorists (Lacan, Badiou...) can help us bury pro-capitalist ideologues like Foucault and Butler once and for all. But I digress...

2018-09-18 19:19:53,9gxuvh,12,6,"Hey, so I kinda feel bad about posting this since I feel like there are so many already out there, but I figured at worst case it will only get buried and I'll still be in the same spot anyway.

So I am AFAB, 19 years old. I've identified as genderfluid since I was 15, when I learned the term, but ever since I've been plagued by the thought I can't come out since ""its only a phase, and I'll grow out of it."" Because of this I've never told anyone that I felt male, and my Mom has been fairly adamant on buying me girly clothes, luckily she's stopped this once I left the house, but she's made her point on how much she wants me to act like a girl. And my Dad isn't super understanding either.

The problem is that in the past I have not  felt a strong inclination towards one gender or the other, except occasionally when I feel that the she/her or my feminine birth name is just wrong and it causes me a bit of unease. Recently this all changed. I got fed up of hiding who I am, someone called my by my birth name and I felt incredibly dysphoric when they used the she/her pronouns. So I came out as genderfluid to one of my best friends and my little brother (both very accepting), but these doubts continue to plague me. Since I don't always feel disgust at my body, and this happens occasionally and I usually just feel gender neutral. But ever since I came out I have felt far more masculine than in the past and I haven't felt feminine at all.

Some more information:

I feel euphoria with: 

* wearing male clothes
* appearing masculine
* seeing my chest flat (I literally started laughing and crying at the same time when I got a binder)
* passing
* the idea of making myself more masculine: tattoos, piercings, etc...

I feel dysphoric with:

* my hair length (it is too long, I'm getting it cut tomorrow)
* my boobs (I hate hugging people and can rarely bring myself to do it)
* my lips and facial structure (very feminine)
* people using she/her pronouns when I feel masculine
* my voice (too high)

When I say I feel gender neutral, its more of a numb ""I don't care at all"" feeling. I don't know if this is actually what it feels like to be gender neutral or if I have just suppressed myself so long.

I do not experience dysphoria with my genitals or my period, but I'm not sure if this is something that I might feel discomfort with later once I am more comfortable identifying as male since this seems more recent. I am terrified of really coming out if it is a phase, but I do feel really strongly about it right now.

I like the idea of testosterone, but I don't like the idea of having body or facial hair (everything else male is fine) and I think that stuff isn't cut and dry. If I had the choice I probably would have been born male. But I also don't want to do through a surgery, that sounds terrifying to me. I feel guilty for wanting to be male when there are people who are struggling with this a lot more than I am. 

In the past I have always felt gender neutral, only occasionally male. I did try to change my name to be gender neutral in elementary school and got ridiculed for it. I was able to wear what I wanted (male-style clothes without being straight masculine) without anyone questioning me, since I just looked like a tom-boy. So these feelings are catching me off guard. It doesn't help that I can't pin down my sexual identity either. 

But in the past I have been interested in dresses or makeup (not so much anymore), but I can't tell if that was more of my desire or that I just wanted to be accepted by those around me.

Anyway, I guess my question comes down to this: Am I genderfluid? Trans? Non-binary? Just like cross-dressing? What it is like to be gender neutral? Is this all a phase? Is it weird if I never felt this way as a child? And what can I do?

&amp;#x200B;

2018-09-24 23:50:58,9in5qb,6,14,"I'm born female. I'm a college student. I'm biromantic and asexual.

For the past year or so I've been questioning gender things. But I always keep jumping back and forth between thinking I might not be female, not entirely at least, and that I could never be anything else. 

Sometimes I feel like the ""I could never be"" means that I could never allow myself or that I could never pass if I was. I'm still a product of how I was raised, so I still have a lot of internalized phobias. But also knowing that even if I knew for sure, that it would be even worse for my family to find out than if they found out I'm bi/ace. And also knowing that my body would never pass.

I don't know anything for sure. Just that I feel like 'something' maybe 90% of time, neither or both female/male. Maybe 8% I get a strong feeling that I'm male, but it lasts maybe a few hours at a time. And the remaining 2% is female. There are some days I wish I were male, that I'd be happier that way. I even picked out names. On rare occasion, I feel very feminine. I don't like presenting feminine. 

I guess I just wish I'd been born male, that I'd be happier then. But I fear regret so much. I'm anxious and fearful of everything.

I\'m a college student. I\'m biromantic and asexual.\n\nFor the past year or so I\'ve been questioning gender things.

I\'m still a product of how I was raised, so I still have a lot of internalized phobias. But also knowing that even if I knew for sure, that it would be even worse for my family to find out than if they found out I\'m bi/ace.

Maybe 8% I get a strong feeling that I\'m male, but it lasts maybe a few hours at a time. And the remaining 2% is female. There are some days I wish I were male, that I\'d be happier that way. I even picked out names. On rare occasion, I feel very feminine. I don\'t like presenting feminine. \n\nI guess I just wish I\'d been born male, that I\'d be happier then. But I fear regret so much.
