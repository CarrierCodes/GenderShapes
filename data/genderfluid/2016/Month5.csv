I'm an actor who recently got a role playing a character that is gender fluid. I've been doing a lot of research on gender-fluidity, but I was wondering if anyone would be interested in talking to me about  being gender-fluid and answering some questions I have. 

I'm trying to make sure this portrayal is as honest and true as possible, and there's only so much you can learn through reading articles.

2016-05-01 17:49:17,4haauf,8,9,"Hello everyone.  I've very recently discovered the term ""genderfluid"" and realized that I identify strongly with what I've discovered.  

I was AMAB, and, while  I didn't know or understand it until more recently, experienced feminine feelings growing up.  I quickly learned that ""boys don't do that"" and ""boys don't wear that"", and set about working to be a good boy - wanting to fit in and not wanting to attract attention.

Around college, I began experimenting with feminine clothing, much to my fiancé's chagrin.  She wasn't happy about it, so I set it aside - men don't do that, and I'm a man. Inevitably, the need to dress up returned, so I began doing it stealthily (at least, I thought I was being stealthy - my wife knew, and still didn't like it).  Fast forward to recently, and after many years of hiding and suppressing, I developed periodic bouts of depression (self-diagnosed - I was still too scared to talk to anyone else), culminating recently in full-on despair.

After breaking down and sharing **all** my thoughts and feelings with my wife (and after allowing her time to work through her own feelings about it), I'm finally working towards acknowledging and accepting this aspect of myself, and I'm blessed that my wife is supportive.  That's not to say that she likes it, but rather, she loves me, sees me hurting, and wants to help me get better.

I recently began counseling, have started journaling (the first time I've ever allowed any of these words/thoughts/feelings outside of my own head), and am beginning to carefully craft a support system.  My emotions are all over the place, as is my sense of my own gender.  At times, I feel foolish and embarrassed for feeling the way I do, and at other times, I just want to shout my feelings out as loud as I can for everyone to hear.

So this is my story so far; I just wanted to introduce myself because I'm searching for support groups (online and in-person) so I can start to feel part of a community - something I've lacked nearly my entire life.  

I'm looking forward to getting to know you all.

2016-05-03 14:13:57,4hnfs9,1,11,"One thing that has hugely helped me to become aware of how gender is a social construct, is exposure to different cultures.  I've become aware of this both when traveling, and when participating in different subcultures in my own community.

I've noticed that specific gender norms are often highly variable culturally.  For example, where I live now in the U.S., most of the women, when they wear jeans, wear skinny jeans or other very closely-fitting jeans, and the men usually wear much baggier jeans.  Often if I'm wearing women's skinny jeans I look a little out of place, like I stand out, as an AMAB person wearing them.  But when I was in Germany, this norm goes out the window, German men often wear super tight jeans, and I even got comments about how my pants were ""so loose"" if I wore jeans more typical of what men wear here.

Another culturally variable norm I've noticed is shaving.  I shave my legs, and I sometimes have gotten comments where people ask me: ""Oh, do you swim?"" as if I need some reason for doing it.  But like in Hispanic cultures I have seen more men who shave their legs, certainly not all or most but like, it's more within the range of ""typical"" behaviors, so people don't notice it as anything deviant.

I also have noticed this with qualities of personality, communication, etc.  For example, in the culture I'm surrounded by there is a stereotype of women being more emotional and men being more stoic and less openly passionate.  But I've noticed that in the Hispanic cultures I've had exposure to, men often talk more openly about being motivated by feelings, being passionate about things, etc.

So like basically I have found that for me when I go into different cultures, my concept of my own gender changes.  I think I'm a better fit for the constructs of masculinity or femininity in some cultures than others, both in terms of aesthetics and self-expression, and in terms of social norms.

One last thing, I think I tend to think more about gender when I'm in strongly gendered cultures.  When I was at college, it was less strongly gendered of an environment, and I felt like my own gender identity became less important.  Where I live now, it feels strictly gendered and my own identity feels important because it articulates or describes a clash I feel and I way I feel ""between"" or ""outside of"" the two groups that I see most people fitting into.",genderfluid,Does your concept of gender and self-identity change in different cultures?,1462310037.0,"{'created_utc': 1462284837, 'id': '4hnfs9', 'num_comments': 1, 'score': 11, 'selftext': 'One thing that has hugely helped me to become aware of how gender is a social construct, is exposure to different cultures.

2016-05-10 02:49:08,4in85k,11,3,"Hello! This is my first post on Reddit. I was hoping to post this in a couple-few places and maybe get some advice or ideas for this confliction I have.

I don’t really know how to start this off entirely, due to never going this in depth about it before vocally. So, some of this may be more like bullet points than fledged out wording, I’m not sure.

I guess I will start by stating that I am female bodied and I am genderneutral from what I understand. I don’t mind any pronouns and I never exactly want to cut off any of my body parts strongly one way or another or hate them for what they are on me. However, I could do away with it all if I could opt out of having them altogether no problem. The thing is here that I feel I may be happier/more comfortable as a male, even if it’s just in clothed appearance and not a 100% change. I do not know a lot of this topic of types of changes one can make, so I am open to those who want to share knowledge on all types of sex change options out there of any kind.
I have been between feeling male some days (like today) and more female the next (I never really feel 100% anything, but I do feel stronger male when I do than I do stronger female. Most days I just don’t even think about it while in the middle ground as I have been for a long while), while also being neither or both (basically not caring about it) another. I am a bit confused about it, but I feel being male in some regard for me would be the preferred confusion situation. I feel I would probably be more comfortable, at least a bit, if male in at least appearance for some part, rather than my female self as I am right now. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t mind girl-ing up and looking like a true princess some days (like you can see in pictures at the bottom of this post as well as my days I want to look more like a gentleman). 

So, I wouldn’t need to entirely change my facial structure to feel more secure (though I do like many looks I see on trans males who went through the change that are convincing with the thought of my own face looking such a way as well as the thought of light facial hair other days). I was once a voice actor and portray a lot of myself through different voices, even a little girl’s at times (just can come out when giddy/excited about something enough) and I don’t entirely know how I’d feel about that change. I know how to do a boy’s voice, so many that wouldn’t be entirely lost, but still. It’d be… Different in a way I’m a bit wary about, but I still want to know my male voice personally. I did over time naturally get a more neutral/deeper voice and I wonder if it was from this inner male self becoming more natural in my person to me and I don’t overly care about having a female voice (outside of said abilities with manipulating my current voice to show expression)

I want to be a girlfriend to a girlfriend, rather than a male with a girlfriend (at least for right now). I’m not 100% against the idea of being male-bodied in some regard to a girlfriend the more I think about it, but I’ve never had a girlfriend, only boyfriends. I’m 85% lesbian at least (that’s the female side of me. I am bisexual, but not a very sexual person. So being male with a boyfriend in a not very sexual relationship isn’t beyond me, really), but I like personality more than bodies or sex. I like the female body a lot more, but I also like both body’s chest types. I’m not into or like the idea of penetration sex (vaginally, anyway. Anal doesn’t bother me). Penetration is very uncomfortable for me (practically sickeningly so. Likely due to the way my body developed from a rather extreme birth situation and, past sexual abuses from males, and likely some type of attraction/orientation I haven’t gone into deep depth about outside of being bisexual) and hurts like /crazy/. I haven’t had a penis fully inside of me due to the hot knife pain. However, I do like rubbing/humping with another person. I am able to climax from that alone due to my having a vagina. So, I still want/like the idea of being a girlfriend to a girlfriend. I haven’t thought too deeply about saying I am genderneutral/half female/female some of the time while having gotten a sex change if I did. That could be enough on its own, but I do enjoy the thought of females with females for myself. The curves, body parts, voices, but I feel perhaps if I found the right partner, that could be better understood for myself with someone understanding, caring, and supportive/open to the ideas for my body.

I do want to know what my voice would sound like as male. I know you can in audio editing, but it sounds oddly robotic to me a lot of the time and I don’t often enjoy the sound, compared to a natural voice. I also don’t like having to do the whole process, compare to being able to speak it on my own. Is there a device of some kind that lets you hear an opposite gender voice of your own as you speak or something?

I feel the most comfortable at all times with really short hair. I like pigtails, but other than that I don’t like anything about having long hair. On other’s it’s more than okay, it’s just a preference for myself. I own wigs and like to collect them, so there’s no real problem there if I wanted longer or dyed hair, it’s just that storing the things are a nightmare and a half, so I have been yet able to collect anymore or better wear them.

I enjoy frilly/poofy dresses (it’s a sort of dream of mine to own a princess dress ^///^’’) and I also really would love to own a custom-made tux. I own male clothes (boxers, shirts, jackets), but I also like cute panties, knee high stockings, cute shoes, light makeup (mostly just eyeliner and lip gloss, maybe blush sometimes), the works. This is a part of it I do enjoy. I love having so many options to wear and express, however, I don’t like the nagging feeling I can get about wanting to be in another body type, wanting to know. I get a bit conflicted with the idea of the change, because I know I am just a very neutral person. I have friends who have been fully trans and very passionate about changing, certain, but I’m not as passionate. However, I still want it. I like my breasts, sort of, but I like the idea of a flat, natural male chest, as well. I used to be more attached when trying to look female, but I could take them or leave them as long as I could still manage to wear girly dresses somehow. What matters to me on those days is my face and how pretty I look to myself, rather than a guy. I am not at all attached to my vagina (kind of hate having one at all due to all its problems, but not /because/ it’s a vagina) outside of rubbing is awesome and I’d like to know what it’s like to have sex with a girl or be sexual with one a bit, at least. I also like guys that have more female like butts, so I’d probably keep mine as is. It’s kind of a cross between them, anyway. I have broader shoulders than most females (runs in the family and keeps me out of a lot of pretty clothes &gt;&lt;) and while I have curves in my middle, I have sort of flat hips. I also have semi or full abdominal obesity. All the fat my whole life just focuses on my midsection for some reason. I wouldn’t at all mind being chubby. I find chubby girls really cute and attractive, but when all of it centers in one place rather than all over and won’t go away no matter what I do… It’s bothersome as all hell to my confidence. I can’t get myself to wear most tight dresses or bathing suits. Since it won’t leave, I also am considering surgery for fat reduction, as well.

I once questioned if I was trans, which I still sometimes wonder on some level, and that I really like the idea of being a male that cross dresses. Be it in a female body or not. However, I do mind at least a bit not being seen outwardly as a crossdressing male when doing so. It’s a bit depressing.

Here’s an issue I have with the change… I have fear of surgery due to needles (like being put under, shots, bloodwork, but I could try my best to get past the phobia). However, I have mental, neurological, and physical ailments. We have yet to understand why, but as time as gone on, I have become unable to take most pills. I was happily taking them, but one day when I was taking them, I couldn’t swallow them. They weren’t horse pills, either (I wouldn’t have been able to take those even at that time). As long as the pill was in my mouth, no matter how much or how little the water, tilt of my body or head, distraction of some kind, I couldn’t make myself swallow. It was scary as hell. This went on for a short while before the ability returned suddenly. It was there for a bit before it vanished randomly again. Each time it left, the time it was gone got longer and longer, as the time I could got shorter and shorter. I think it’s gone on for more than a year now since I’ve been really solidly able to take average sized pills, so it seems now it may be permanent. When I’d get a bigger pill down (bigger than birth control or the smallest Clonidine pill ((Tic disorder/sleep medicine that also is known to lower blood pressure, but that’s not an issue I have as of yet)) ) by some miracle, I’d very often choke and gag on it, over time creating an anxiety about it due to the horrible feeling and an already existing, deep phobia of vomiting. So, now it’s harder than ever. It’s like it was developmental and my throat became tighter in the passage way, as I used to get Advil sized pills down just fine, but now it can take a while even with pills smaller than the area of your fingertip. I also have a strong gag reflex, so that doesn’t help anything on top of the rest. So, would there be some way to lower my voice pitch or anything like that without pills?... Maybe some type of dissolving tablet or very small, very small pill? Even Wellbutrin pills are too big at this point. Also, if post or pre-surgery takes pills… I dunno how that would go. I really want this a lot of the time or at least the option, so I don’t want my health to take /another/ thing away from me, like it has most else. Even if it just made my voice more between a male and female, rather than just my tone/default style of speaking.

Does anyone have any suggestions or responses or experiences/relations to anything I’ve said? Most all is welcome. I wouldn’t 100% need my facial structure to overall change, due to having a semi-neutral look already when I make myself look male. I once was able to really well, but I think my face was a bit less chubby back then. Perhaps at my 20/21 age now I look more feminine (while not extremely so), rather than 18/19 years old face. However, this could be false and I just haven’t made myself up pretty or more masculine in a long while. Just haven’t had the motivation to, but I am starting to get it again. Unlike most I’ve known, I don’t care as deeply to my core as they do, but that doesn’t mean I don’t want the change in some form, genderneutral or not. I find it more comfortable and even rather exciting/feels like forward motion in my life. I just sort of know next to nothing and have some significant disadvantages to going about it.

Here are some pictures of me in both of my looks. Please reply with ideas, suggestions, questions, comments, and such bellow to this post? I really want to communicate about this, but I don’t really know how to go about any of these wants or conflictions just yet.
Thank you very much for taking the time to read this and or reply! It really means a lot to me, as I’ve never gone this in depth about it before.

I am a bit confused by how to post pictures with text posts to Reddit, so I'll just include a link to the gallery. Let me know if there are any problems with that!

It’s like it was developmental and my throat became tighter in the passage way, as I used to get Advil sized pills down just fine, but now it can take a while even with pills smaller than the area of your fingertip. I also have a strong gag reflex, so that doesn’t help anything on top of the rest. So, would there be some way to lower my voice pitch or anything like that without pills?... Maybe some type of dissolving tablet or very small, very small pill? Even Wellbutrin pills are too big at this point. Also, if post or pre-surgery takes pills… I dunno how that would go. I really want this a lot of the time or at least the option, so I don’t want my health to take /another/ thing away from me, like it has most else. Even if it just made my voice more between a male and female, rather than just my tone/default style of speaking.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions or responses or experiences/relations to anything I’ve said? Most all is welcome. I wouldn’t 100% need my facial structure to overall change, due to having a semi-neutral look already when I make myself look male. I once was able to really well, but I think my face was a bit less chubby back then. Perhaps at my 20/21 age now I look more feminine (while not extremely so), rather than 18/19 years old face. However, this could be false and I just haven’t made myself up pretty or more masculine in a long while. Just haven’t had the motivation to, but I am starting to get it again. Unlike most I’ve known, I don’t care as deeply to my core as they do, but that doesn’t mean I don’t want the change in some form, genderneutral or not. I find it more comfortable and even rather exciting/feels like forward motion in my life. I just sort of know next to nothing and have some significant disadvantages to going about it.\n\nHere are some pictures of me in both of my looks. Please reply with ideas, suggestions, questions, comments, and such bellow to this post? I really want to communicate about this, but I don’t really know how to go about any of these wants or conflictions just yet.\nThank you very much for taking the time to read this and or reply! It really means a lot to me, as I’ve never gone this in depth about it before.\n\nI am a bit confused by how to post pictures with text posts to Reddit, so I'll just include a link to the gallery.

I just wanted to share something that happened today that was probably completely inconsequential, maybe accidental, and totally made my day.


So for as long as I can remember ive been at odds with what I am supposed to be. Amab, but the mind never always agreed.

For months I would be completely confident with my tall broad beardy self wearing great suits and well fitted shirts that emphasised the godgiven muscle genes they blessed me with. 

And then for months after that, not at all happy about it. The mind never matched the mirror, they were too hairy, couldn't wear beautiful dresses outside, was ashamed of the figure that lacked the curves it really yearned for.

The last few months have been, what i think to be the beginning of an acceptance though. I can at least affirm to myself now that I am ok being what I need to be. I paint my nails because it makes me happy and I wear the nicest female pants around the house (which is shared with friends [the house, not the pants]). I am becoming content with both of me. I accept my femme moods and their emergent actions and as i do each half draws closer to a whole. This makes me happy and a lot less stressed.


But I digress, what really made my day recently, was at work, neatly set into my societally accepted role. 

I had to contact a service centre to organise some repair works, by phone I have a reasonably neutrally set voice, and am blessed with an ambiguous name. So after what seemed like an hour confirming service and warranty details, passing on troubleshooting steps taken etc, I recieve approval for the repair work to take place. 

Followed by an email, and I really got a kick out of how it began.

2016-05-11 17:30:21,4iw212,2,3,"Hey :) (btw. I'm 19 and born female)

So a few weeks ago I was in the living room and I thought about my gender. I thought I might be FtM but I'm also okay with being female.

I guess I best described it when I was 11. I told me best friend several times that ""I wish I would've been born as a boy"". Which doesn't mean that I'd change my sex or body in any way to be male, but it doesn't mean that I feel good about being female either.

So I thought about just identifying as ""female"". I'm not a girl nor a woman nor will I ever be a women. But I'm also not male. I'm ""female""

anyway. When I stood in the living room, looking at myself I started to think this:

**I just thought to myself: ""What do you see when you look into the mirror? Boy or girl?""

so I looked into the reflection of me in the window, the night outside made my picture clear, but: ""neither. Or Both?""

I looked some more: ""I got long hair, like a girls. Not too long but not as short as a guy would wear. I'm overweight, I got big breasts and a toned figure. My face, not so feminine, I guess. Not masculin either. My expression. Like a criminal, but that's normal for me. It came with the (almost)never-smiling years of my childhood. The childhood I spend playing with pink and blue. Just like I spend my teenage years - pink and blue. More blue? Maybe I tried to hard with the blue. But what for? I liked the pink. I guess. I just didn't like to talk about it as pink. I talked about it as a hobby, as a thing grown men do as well. Just not everday men, maybe. But some.""

""so I needed excuses? for myself? for others? for what or whom? What's wrong with the pink? That it made me feel bad about myself. Who thought that maybe pink is stronger than blue? Maybe it is. Maybe I'm just pathetic.""

""There it is again: Pathetic because of pink? There I feel it again how it tears me down, everything but my shell which I can't figure out.""**

hope it's not too confusing :P

I actually have a question though: what would you think could be a term I could identify as?

I've never dressed up as a guy (but I will as soon as I live alone and learn to lower my voice)

but I'm defenitly curious if it would fit me and if I'd feel better being called male pronounces and so on.

I always liked it when someone else on the internet thought I was male, but maybe it's different from the real world? I don't know. I don't have friends with whom I could talk about this. I could talk to my parents about this and they probably wouldn't have a problem, but I'm not ready

2016-05-13 12:32:09,4j63h0,3,5,"A little backstory:

I was born male but for as long as I can remember I have wish to be female. The most vivid memories of this start at around the time I was 10 or 11. However, at the time I had no idea what this was so I suppressed it. I have continued to do so for basically the last 13 years up until recently when it came to a boiling point and I discovered it was the cause of my anxiety. 

My anxiety has been getting worse and worse over the years but once I accepted this and stopped ignoring it, every sign of anxiety is gone. No panic attacks, no tingling in the arms or breathing problems any more. It's even easier to just go outside in general. I am even more confident than I was before.

Now about my confusion:

At first I was willing to accept I was just MTF and figure it out from there. But I started noticing it would change throughout the day. One moment I would have very intense gender dysphoria and wish I was a woman. A few hours later I would feel completely fine as a man and question why I had those feelings to begin with.

For me it seems to ""shift"" throughout the day, maybe because I have been suppressing it for so long. Clothes don't tend to bug me as 90% of mine are neutral anyways, always have been. 

I did try a ""test"" yesterday. I recorded every time I felt different for starters:

In the morning I felt Neutral. Then completely male for two hours. After that most of the day was female, followed by male in the late afternoon and female for the rest of the day after that.

During the times I felt Female and had normal dysphoria of my own body I could picture myself were ""girly"" clothes and it made me feel happier. During the times I felt Male, if I tried to picture myself in the same clothes I felt that same feeling of dysphoria towards that imagined version of me.

When I felt female looking in the mirror I wish I had longer hair and I was kindof annoyed by my reflection (not sure how to describe it). When I felt male I was confident in my appearance and happier.

So, as you can see I am terribly confused. I guess this is what happens when your suppress something so long.

My basic question is: Is this genderfluid? Or something else? 

When I read the definition of genderfluid and read other peoples experiences with me it felt for the first time something fit my feelings so perfectly. 

Maybe I am overthinking this as it's odd to have a label for something after so long.

Now the topic I have in mind isn't bathrooms, who is and isn't faking it, or any of the other issues that are popping up about it right now, no I want to talk about how everyone is gender fluid. Now you may be ready to make a comment damning me, but just give me a minute to explain myself. Everyone is gender fluid, to an extent I should say, everyone falls somewhere on the spectrum of gender, no matter how manly you are, you got some girly girl in you and vice versa, but it doesn't stop there, some days you may feel more dudebro and others more ladysis (couldn't think of an equivalent to dudebro so I made one up), so in essence aren't we all at least a little gender fluid? I mean, if we stop looking at the labels and crap, if we look at those words for what they are, doesn't everyone fit into the box of gender fluid? As I said let's look at those words, gender has to do mainly with behavior and to a lesser extent dress, it really came from that arbitrary need to define things, to say men fix cars and pound brews while women talk about shoes and get manicures. In reality this word doesn't matter in the slightest, people who try to say what people can and can't do based on their parts and mannerisms, people who say that if a guy goes out onto the street wearing a skirt, but still has a full beard, he's a freak, why? It doesn't make any sense, guys have been wearing skirts for centuries in more eastern cultures, and some of them have been the most manly guys out there, fucking samurai wore skirts, and those were some tough sons of bitchs. What we wear and how we act don't matter, the only reason people think they matter is because in general people who were born with the male sex are usually more masculine, and those born with the female sex are more feminine, that's obviously because of hormones, but even so, every man has some estrogen, and every woman has some testosterone, we all have both, so if you think about it, doesn't that make us fluid in our gender? Because we have both, and because us humans are walking contradictions, we can swing one way or the other on any given day, our gender, like everything else, is a river, constantly flowing, and as time goes on and erosion happens, our rivers change and take new shapes, we flow differently, so what we identify with and how we act moves with the waters. My belief in this actually has some very simple reasoning, I believe that we should judge based on content of character over your gender, or sex, or race, or nationality, or anything, at the end of the day we're all people, and we don't need the boxes and labels, you should deside to like or dislike someone based on if they're an asshole or not. Does that person steal candy from a little kid? Do they try to be there for people who need a little help, be it some spare cash to fill up their car, or just a caring ear to vent out the bullshit they have to deal with at work? Is that person the type to rob a bank, and if they are, will they shoot the little girl who's scared and crying? These are the questions to ask folks, not are you gender X or do you fuck gender X? I've seen to many people say that this person isn't trans or gender fluid enough, or, they're faking it for attention, stop it people, you need to realize that most folk are trying to get by and be happy just like you, so stop trying to put them into a box or try to shit on them because of something that has no relevance to them being a good or bad person.
