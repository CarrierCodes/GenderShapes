A few questions. I want to start expressing myself which is hard. I'm not sure what to do with my hair, what's a good style to look masculine when I need it to but feminine when I want?

I guess that's just 1 question. I have more but I don't want to post a wall of text.

So, I'm trying to work out a mental paradox of sorts. A while back, I used to CD fairly regularly. I enjoyed envisioning myself as being female/feminine. I didn't just want to be in female clothes, but I wanted my body to be feminine. I wanted to express as female. 

But... I am incredibly content as a man right now. I have no desire to present as a woman, nor do anything to alter my (true) male self. I have a beard, more chest hair than a gorilla, and shoulders that would make a quarterback jealous. I've always wondered about trying to be more feminine though shaving/makeup/herbs/etc. But I have zero desire to do anything lasting or permanent to my male self. Of course, this means my feminine presentation is very ""limited"". 

So how can I work though this and appease the ""feminine desire?"" I know in reality I won't actually take steps away from my masculinity, but why is femininity still appealing? How have ya'll worked though this? I hope this is the right place to ask.

2016-08-01 22:44:32,4vp9br,6,8,"So I know this is kind of silly, but I've developed a sort of pet peeve where it bugs me when I see the use of ""gender fluid"" versus ""genderfluid"". 

(apologies that this ended up as kind of a rant o//o)

I've seen genderfluid people and other trans folks who aren't genderfluid use different variations of the term (genderfluid, gender fluid, gender-fluid), and it doesn't bother me since those people tend to have an understanding of genderfluidity and/or gender/trans stuff. 

I used to be pretty indifferent to this, but over the years I've seen articles cropping up that talk about ""gender fluidity"" as a fashion trend. For example, there've been a lot of articles assuming that Jaden Smith is ""gender fluid"" because of his style that breaks traditional gender norms. I love his sense of style and he may very well be genderfluid, but he hasn't said anything about it (as far as I've seen, correct me if I'm wrong), so the articles feel kind of like they're disrespecting his voice in the matter. It comes off as the writers not understanding that genderfluid people are real and that it's a legitimate gender identity versus just a series of fashion choices.

So now because of all that, I get kind of annoyed when I see people without an understanding of genderfluidity refer to it as ""gender fluid"", or ""gender fluid style"". I've come out to people, cis and trans, who initially only ""support"" me because they think I'm a cis girl who wants to mix up my fashion sense versus ""genderfluid"" being a descriptor for my gender identity. (Cue ""not trans enough?"" feelings :( )

Is this all just in my head? Do more genderfluid people split the term into two words than I thought?

I don't exactly consider myself genderfluid, but I'm posting here as I feel it's somewhat relevant as I like having an feminine side to myself. (Ideally I'd wear some clothing that suggest some degree of femininity and shave my body, but I'm rather uncomfortable doing so in public.)

Nearly everyone I talk to about the search for employment and the unfortunate reality that my hair will limit my choices agrees that I need to suck it up and cut it off.  Apparently, if I want long hair I have to establish myself first.  It reaches about 4 inches past my shoulders, isn't dyed, and I just recently had it trimmed to clean up any dead ends and make it look neater.  If I was a girl there'd be no questions asked regarding my hair as it isn't by any means abnormal.  But because I'm a guy, it's not seen as professional.

This situation is no doubt a common one (though the reasons for wanting long hair may differ from person to person), though I feel like my disposition to hair related issues makes things more complicated....
***
I'll try and keep the backstory story short, but I've always been opposed to haircuts.  My parents were always in charge of when I'd get my hair cut and how I'd get it cut, only loosening their grip late into high school to allow it to be slightly longer than the standard nerdy ""my mom picked this cut.""  When I finally expressed interest in growing it, I got the ever repeated talk about how it will make others judge me and how self expression is unimportant as it impacts other's judgments.  Eventually even the slightly longer hair style I wore in high school was revoked from me after my parents secretly scheduled me a haircut, gave me a 3 minutes heads up, and my mother screamed at me until I would submit and have her drive me there and tell them to cut it short.  I couldn't look in the mirror for a week without my feeling nauseous.  Any time someone brought up my hair I felt my stomach do a flip and skin felt like pins and needles.  After two years of college, and more forced haircuts, I finally broke down crying to my mom over the phone telling her I couldn't take another haircut.  This also led to me telling her that I'm interested in guys (I said I was bisexual, though over time I feel like I lean more towards being gay) as the conversation progressed as I was afraid she'd draw conclusions, and I thought I might as well get it out of the way.  Her reaction, while shocked was neither positive or negative, and she hopes it's just a phase though was never nasty to me about it.

The other element to this story is that a good deal of my sexual attraction...is based around hair.  I love guys with long hair, and want to be able to pull off the look myself.  Even when a guy doesn't have long hair I find myself staring whenever someone has a particularly pretty hairstyle.  Even though I prefer guys, girls can have memorizing hairstyles as well.  A particularly pretty hair braid, a colorful pixie cut, I love it all so much.  Having somewhat of a hair fetish makes my predicament even more painful to me, as I often wish I could put my hair in a fancy bun or a fishtail braid.

Last, and fair warning this is really weird.  But for as long as I can remember, I have had a haircutting fetish.  I'm sexually aroused by watching mostly women have their hair cut very short or completely shaved off.  There's no sexual content in these videos/images, just hair cutting.  Perhaps this was a development due to my complete lack of freedom regarding my own hair and ability to be feminine.  I can't really explain why I have such a fetish, but I just do.  It was essentially all I would view for sexual pleasure in my high school years, though over time I distanced myself from it as it was upsetting to me to be aroused by something like that.  Having my haircut short mimics the feelings of humiliation and punishment present in some of those videos and makes me feel like I'm being disgraced.  Hence the not being able to look in a mirror after my cuts.  It makes me feel sub-human.

aaaanyway, tonight i went out in a dress, and a groups of girls started sniggering and decided to gossip between themselves, but obviously aiming for me to hear. they said that wearing a corset under a dress makes me look like a prostitute and my fat ass makes me look like a pear, and also that my chicken fillets make me look tacky. just to clarify, i had neither a corset or chicken fillets. i had a bra and knickers under my dress. 
This has made me so, SO insecure about myself now. i already hate my body shape 90% of the time because it doesn't lend to gender neutral clothing well, but the fact that these girls took my biggest issues and blew them up has made me feel like utter shite. i feel like i cant go out in feminine clothing now because obviously my insecurities are the parts of me that are most noticeable. i feel like i can't go out in masculine clothing because my body is too ""female"". and i feel like i have HUGE amounts of dysphoria brewing about my chest and my waist because they're apparently so pronounced unless they're covered with baggy clothing.

I introduced myself here last week, saying I was thinking of coming out to my friends and family (here's the post: https://m.reddit.com/r/genderfluid/comments/4yt6wd/coming_out_and_questioning/).

Well...I did it. I'm now officially out. I bought a binder and have started wearing it - more on that in a sec - and over the past few days I've been slowly coming out to my friends, one by one. It doesn't get any less scary, no matter how many times I say the words, but damn. The amount of love and support and encouragement I've gotten has been astonishing. I had no idea. I just...damn. I feel so lucky.
I'm still not really out to my family; my dad in particular leans more toward the conservative, and I don't think he'd ever understand or accept it.

Binding has been an experience. Actually putting the damn thing on was a Herculean effort all by itself. But wearing it out and about felt awesome.

It feels so. good. to finally be out. It's a lot of work, but I'm more comfortable in my skin than I think I've ever been.

I'm *me*.

I started to worry that I will never be able to appear fluid enough without surgery and started to analyze what's going on in my brain more.

While thinking about this I came with a quick exercise that gave me some relief and I thought it can help someone else too.

It's simple. Take a piece of paper, a notebook, journal or whatever you like and write down:

* Things you already have that let you be gender-fluid. Maybe you have beautiful hair or sharp facial features?

* Things you can wear that already fit you. You have legs perfect for leggings or square shoulders which make that jacket fit right?

* Other easy things you can do with your body. Ear piercings? Cut down your hair? Wear makeup? Grow out your brows?
