2016-11-02 03:58:01,5anvz5,1,11,"So I've hit a crossroads in my life.  I went out over Halloween weekend as very openly gender fluid to a party with some friends.  My costume was not drag per se, just me being a genuinely feminine presenting fallen angel.  It was bit nerve wracking because it meant coming out to several friends and acquaintances, but I am fortunate that all of them have a progressive view about gender and it was by and large a non-issue to them.  Some of them have even said that I've become much less of an enigma to them, and though I was nervous I was super comfortable for the first time.  After more contemplating over the weekend, and realizing that presenting as masculine is something that in all reality has been a bit alien to me, don't see any need to delay it any longer.  I am ready to do a non binary transition.

Transition for me will largely be a social one, though there will be some minor cosmetic and medical things done.  The big one is giving myself far more freedom than ever to be able to present more andro to femme, and finding out what aspects of masculinity that I really want.   It will be a process and not done overnight, but it's like I'm now all awake and excited to finally be truly me, and literally decades of stress has starting to crumble.

I won't bore people with the details that I've covered on my previous post (https://redd.it/59mfsk), but two areas that I'm going to tread lightly, at least for now is work, and family.  Workwise, I'm in a contracted position and want the opportunity to at least get a stable role before I'm ready to take a plunge at anything beyond a gender neutral presentation.  Much the same with family, particularly with my siblings since I'm quite fond of my nephews and nieces whom I don't want to be denied contact with.

One area that I'm needing advice on is that I've been pretty active in a number of outdoor recreational groups on Meetup and Facebook. I've met some good people in these groups, many of whom became good friends, and have even gotten to the level of organizing events with those groups.  I tend to lean gender neutral during any kind of athletic activity, but I know I'll want to femme it up a bit if it's more of a social gathering.  I'm not sure how to approach that.  I want to strike the balance of being more me, but also doing what I can to being openly gender fluid a by and large non-issue.  Suggestions?

2016-11-03 22:49:49,5b00x9,2,5,"I posted here a little while ago. I'd say I started questioning my gender identity/expression almost two months ago. I'm slowly coming to terms with identifying all the gender related issues I feel that I've had since I was young.  

I'm trying to experiment at my own pace. I purchased a gc2b binder and I wear it almost everyday. I was really emotional when I put it on and really happy. I think the idea of having a more masculine body felt natural to me. I'm hoping to purchase men's clothes to experiment with my gender expression.

As I've been realising these feelings, my dysphoria has gone into overdrive. I recognise now my strong waves of feeling male whilst knowing I'm AFAB. These have been consistent for a good few weeks. 

My body sometimes feels like a shell that I'm in. There are times where I seriously feel I'm being misgendered, I feel this sinking feeling or disconnect as someone calls me ""she"" or ""her"". Sometimes it upsets me or I feel incredibly insulted.

It was becoming difficult socialising because when I was in a situation with just women, I felt like the only guy there. But now I know why, it's easier. Also when I'm amongst guys, I sort of feel like I'm one of them. 

I imagine myself daily as male in everyday situations and it makes me really happy. I think for a long time I've thought of myself as somewhat male, and felt that I'm more myself, if not cooler, that way. I'm perfectly comfortable with people using male pronouns.

I can't justify calling myself a cis woman anymore. Although I've lived as one, it doesn't feel like it describes me as a whole. I go through this whole gender confusion and always end up feeling that I'm a trans guy. I'd like to try living/presenting as one and see how I feel. 

But I feel that if I truly was a binary trans guy, surely I wouldn't be in gender limbo this much. I get fleeting moments where I feel like my assigned gender at birth again somehow? So bizarre.

Before that, I just... Felt sad an uncomfortable in my own body, jealous of girls for their beauty and well, the isnane variety of clothing. (Crossdressing is out of the question for me, it'd be like if you put a Tutu on a Bear)

2016-11-10 05:08:28,5c64mo,2,15,"Like many of you, I had a very restless night of shock, disbelief, and grief over the news that Donald Trump is going to be our next president.  Central to my unrest is my planned non binary transition, and questioning if it was now a wise move considering the political shift to the right.  I woke up, and though my body was a bit stubbly from being on a camping trip, decided to slip into one of my favorite dresses, a pair of hose, and some heels.  What I found was very uplifting.  Though I looked very tired and somber, I found I was able to walk around more elegant and graceful than ever, which anybody who wears heels knows is easier said than done.  It made me realize that I am very much still me, being in touch with my feminine attributes still completes me, and that I can still transition even with Donald Trump as president and the GOP controlling Congress.

I know that in doing this, I will need to reach for bigger strength than would have previously been needed, and there will be extra challenges.  But I know I can do it.  It's going to be rough, and I'll be reaching out more than ever to other genderfluid, non binary, trans, and the rest of the LGBTQ+ community for support, advice, mentorship, and some basic support more than ever.  But I know that I can't go on putting on a shell of a seemingly masculine enough male forever.

As I've mentioned before, I am very blessed to be in the Seattle area, which remains a liberal ray of light in an increasingly red political landscape.  But I know that not every LGBTQ+ person has the same location privilege that I do, and many are in GOP territory, whether the traditional Bible Belt or the rust belt states that unexpectently went for Trump.  If you find yourself in need of a person to talk to, please reach out.  I want to be sure we can band together and weather this red storm that will eventually pass.

One other thing that came as a revelation to me.  Remember that not all Republicans, Trump supporters, working class cisgender white folks, etc. are necessarily hostile to people who are gender fluid.  I have personally known people who have conservative political views but totally ""get"" being gender fluid. Let's not treat them like the enemy when they demonstrate an ability to want to understand and possibly support us, and to take the time to explain what being gender fluid, trans, etc. means in ways that they can understand.

Him telling me, the first person he's talked to about it, that he thinks he's gender fluid is a huge step and I want to make sure we keep taking steps. 

We were both raised by parents who didn't understand. When my dad found out I was dating a girl he tried to ""whip the gay out of me"" and forced me to switch schools. That was my freshman year of high school, when the only person I'd ever kissed was the boy who tried to rape me. That wasn't enough for my family to pull me, the forced kiss and groping and pushing me to my knees. But the possibility of my kissing the same sex? I was yanked immediately. I think I'll always hate my family a little for that. I've never been able to forgive it. But, I met the love of my life at that new high school, so good can come from bad. 

My boyfriend's dad passed away when he was young. His mom struggled to raise him and his siblings. Over all, all three are good people. The oldest will probably live on the couch his entire life and the youngest is in and out of the hospital because of her eating disorder but... trust me. Their mom did the best she could. The damage to the others is easier to see. It's in their aspirations and medical records. My boyfriend is different.

His mom realised very quickly that he would be the man of the house and tried to mould him that way. He knows a man's role and feels like he has to live up to it. Even now he will want something and cry because he doesn't think he can have it and then hate himself for crying.

He's always wanted to put streaks in his hair, something I already do, so when it's time to redo my hair I always offer. He always says his mom would never forgive him and gets sad, so I hold him. I'm glad he lets me do that much. 

I don't know how to help him with this. Is watching him go through this all I can do? Am I doing the right thing by just trying to be supportive? Should I push him to do what he wants more? 

The one thing he doesn't doubt, and I'm so thankful he doesn't, is my love for him. I've been honest with him about my being pansexual, which means to me loving someone without gender or sexuality being a factor, since day 1. I think that's soothing to him.

He's asked me to put eyeliner on him when we get the chance. ""Will baby help me look pretty?"" He asked and I got to tell him that he was already beautiful. I think my biggest issue is that I don't know when he wants to be treated like a girl and be held and called beautiful versus when he wants to be my protector and man. I've never guessed wrong and beckoned him into my arms to be held when it wasn't the correct action but how many times have I not risked the guess and let him feel guilty for wanting the situation to be swapped while he held me? I don't want him to feel guilty for who he is anymore. What can I do?

For as long as I can think of, I've never felt like ""One of the guys."" I can hang out with guys at times, and feel pretty okay with it at times. What I don't feel okay with, however, is being seen as ""just one of the guys.""

In the same vein, however, I've never completely felt like ""One of the girls"" either. Like, I can be around girls and actually feel more chill and at ease, but feel a lot of unease as well. It's kinda like being around both groups makes me more aware that I don't fully identify with either group.

Now, as for when people talk about me, I'm okay with being addressed as a guy, but that gets a little awkward at times when I know I'm seen as a guy, but want to talk more girly stuff.

Another thing that has made its way into my thoughts, my lack of more feminine looks on the upper half of my body. I have a very typical male baldness, and also can grow some moderately thick facial hair. From my face and head alone, I'm seen as a guy. That makes wanting to wear some more feminine items a little awkward as there is an immediate disconnect at my neck.

Another thing, I've lately taken to the idea that wearing a bra under my girls tops actually makes them feel, well, better. It's like there's something missing when the bra isn't there that isn't when the bra is there. Even though I don't have boobs, even wearing something like a sports bra or an A or B cup bra seems to make the tops just fit better.

Another thing, I don't hate my penis. Granted I almost always am a sitter when I pee, and always have a pair of panties on, I don't hate the existence of my penis. It's more like I could do without it, but I don't see myself wanting to remove it right now.

1. To protest the current child support laws and especially the extreme nature of these laws.

2. To give other eunuchs the courage to come out (even though their reasons for their orchiectomies will almost certainly be different from my own reason for my orchiectomy).

3. To provide more spotlight (and attention) on the eunuch community and to de-mystify orchiectomy a bit.

4. To make it clear to people such as medical researchers that, with me, they have a(nother) potential participant in their studies on eunuchs.

2016-11-30 18:57:11,5fredo,3,8,"A couple of years ago, a cousin of mine came out as trans MtF. It got me to thinking a lot about non-binary issues, and now I consider myself an ally of the LGBTQ* community and am trying to learn more. With that has come some questions about myself that I'm trying to understand. Generally speaking, I have considered myself a straight, white emotionally sensitive cis-male.

For years, I was always curious what it was like to wear women's underwear, pantyhose, bras, etc. I vaguely remember playing dress-up as a child, and as a teenager sneaking items from my sister's drawer on very rare occasions. When I was old enough to do so, I bought my own pair of thigh-highs and kept them hidden under my bed. I would wear them secretly at night under my jeans/socks. I would think about what it'd be like to wear other items, but I was always too afraid to buy them. I used to tuck myself between my legs to see what it would look like, and sometimes I would even use ""female"" techniques to touch myself and get off. At some point, I stopped thinking about those things for a while.

Then a couple of years ago, I found myself wanting to wear panties. I started wearing cotton panties because I liked how soft they felt compared to men's underwear, even if they didn't always support me properly. I also started wearing tights/pantyhose whenever it was cold outside. I liked how they made my legs feel.

About a week ago, my girlfriend was out of town and I found one of her bras laying around. In a moment of spontaneity, I tried it on as well as some of her other clothes. Her skinny jeans felt/looked amazing (and actually gave my nonexistant ass some shape). I liked how I looked with a shirt on over my ""new"" bra-induced curves. That was a pretty confusing moment for me. I'm not sure if it was because I felt sexy or what. I have since bought my own ""secret"" bra (36A) that I could wear under my regular clothes.

However, I have always considered myself as just a sensitive guy who is in touch with his anima or feminine side. That I'm ""emotionally feminine."" I find it hard to relate to machismo. Having said that, I used to practice self defense martial arts and I loved it - I felt very badass..empowered...""manly."" I sport a full beard. I used to have a ponytail, but I am balding and it didn't look so good so I shaved it all off. I like my ""manly appearance,"" and I don't hate my genitals or secondary sex traits. I generally identify as a male, who wants to be a better man (by moral/ethical standards) - but I also feel this feminine side begging to be acknowledged and related to by women (in the purest platonic sense).

I have noticed that at certain times of the year, I feel more ""in touch"" with my feminine side. Lately I have felt like crossdressing at home when nobody is around. I have wanted to go shopping for women's pants/jeans to see what fits and looks good. This time last year, I considered presenting myself online as a female version of myself (even came up with a name). I also did something similar when I was a teenager.
