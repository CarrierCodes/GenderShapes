2016-06-08 00:40:18,4n2cli,7,11,"This was a surprisingly powerful experience for me.  I'm sharing it in the hopes that it will help other fluid people who, like me, are new at this and are still finding their feet.  

A few days ago, I woke up with the strangest feeling: I was feeling both very feminine and very un-feminine at the same time.  Not feminine and masculine.  Feminine and not feminine.  There *is* a difference.  I also felt some vague body dysphoria.  Usually I know what part of my body is ""wrong,"" but this time I couldn't tell why; it was just wrong.  Most of the time it's my male chest, but the thought of having breasts actually made me feel worse, so it definitely wasn't that.

I took a nice shower, shaved my face and my legs, and hid my beard shadow with makeup - all things that usually help me feel better on feminine days.  They helped, but it wasn't enough.

When I go out of the house, I almost always present masculine, since I'm not yet totally confident presenting however I want in public.  On this day, though, that just wasn't acceptable.  I didn't want to present fully feminine, but the thought of going masculine just gave me a gross feeling.  I couldn't force myself to do it, not this time.

So I went digging through my wardrobe and came out with a pale red men's collared short-sleeve shirt, slim navy necktie, black denim skirt, and black trilby.  Didn't have any shoes that made sense, so I just wore my usual sneakers.  Added a little more makeup to brighten my face a little.  Looked myself over and was just amazed.  Even though it was just thrown together, it was **perfect.**  My dysphoria surprisingly evaporated, and I went out to run my errands with confidence, just loving the way I looked.

I've never presented in such a deliberately queer way, but this was my day to do it.  I felt like I was showing the world exactly how I felt.  Plus, I've found a new style of outfit that really suits me.

This is not the first time I've had a gender-scrambled day, but it's the first time I've found a way to own it and channel that confusion into something positive.

Later I reflected on why a few strips of fabric had such a profound impact on my state of mind.  I think choosing an outfit *really is* a form of self-expression, something I never really considered much before I identified as fluid.  It's a way to let those confusing and frustrating thoughts out of my head and show the world what I'm feeling, even if they don't get it.

More importantly, though, **it gave me confidence** in my identity and my gender expression.  Taking one of my worst gender days and finding a way to beat it - there was no way in hell I could just hide indoors after a victory like that.  I had to get out and be proud of myself, and doing that has had a permanent positive effect on my self-confidence and self-esteem.

2016-06-11 22:07:30,4nnhw8,8,10,"Okay, this has always been a  burning question in my mind. Having discussed this to a varied group of  friends at my campus, my gay, Conservative friend questioned this:

Basically, he said this: ""Being gay myself, I understand  that a lot of people who identify as neither male or female, but  either both, a shift between the two, or neither,  tend to feel this way as a result of people telling others to act a certain way that's appropriate to their sex.""

I've heard a lot of feminists bring this up, but sweep this belief under the rug as to keep their alliance with the non-binary community. And to be honest, what sparked my own identity was the fact I myself never saw myself adequate enough or deserving to have the body I have.

But that goes to question, do you think if gender-expression was more laiessz-faire, and people didn't enforce so many rules regarding what it means to ""Be a man"" or ""Be a woman,"" do you think the definition of nonbinary identities would exist? or would you think that  the expression would be there, but nobody would care to enforce the whole ""manly/womanly"" aspect?

1) What is the difference between a person's personality and their gender?

2) What is the difference between ""things you like"" and your gender? For example, if you like feminine clothes, does that make you partially feminine or is it how you ACT in those clothes and the WAY you enjoy them that is your gender?

-- I have no idea.

3) What is genderfluidity? Do I have one self that exists at all times but depending on ""mood"" factors in the body changes my preferences and expression? Or is my gender literally CHANGING from time to time?

-- I think the first one?

4) What biologically is genderfluidity? Why on earth would my gender be changing from time to time, seemingly randomly for random durations?

-- No idea again.

5) What does genderless mean? 

-- It almost seems to imply that gender is a 1D scale/spectrum between masculine and feminine, which seems really wrong. To me, gender is an infinite plane in all directions with two very common points, those being masculine and feminine. It sort of gets back to my first question.

2016-06-25 07:16:09,4pri9g,6,16,"TL;DR: My cismale fiance is weirded out by my queerness and gets really upset any time I try to bring it up, even though I came out three years ago (we've been together 4). My relationship feels doomed, I'm scared, please help. :(

Hi! This is my first post here.

I'm genderfluid (hopefully that went without saying), though I have more of a non-binary experience with it: I feel like a blend of genders and land on androgyny most days, with periods of feeling more masc/femme. 

I'm out, but mostly express feminine out of convenience (I was afab and have an ""hourglass"" figure...nice for expressing female, annoying when going andro/masc). I use female pronouns (again, out of convenience; I'm actually not picky about them), I don't experience a ton of dysphoria, and I don't feel the desire/need to go through HRT or surgery of any kind...never have. Honestly, because I can pass as cis pretty well, the hardest part of being genderfluid for me is when I feel unable to express the way I want to/feel.

So: I'm in a long-term relationship with a cisgender, straight man. We're recently engaged and have been together for four years. I came out (to him and myself and everyone) about three years ago, when I was 22, and he got visibly uncomfortable and basically refused to have the conversation.  Having been young and pretty fresh out of an abusive relationship, I defaulted to making myself uncomfortable for his benefit. I kinda just ignored my identity and dealt with occasionally feeling like an imposter-queer.

Now that we're engaged, I'm realizing that, holy shit, I love this man, but I do NOT want to live my entire private life in the closet! Especially since, if he isn't around, I'm extremely happy and open about my gender and sexuality...I feel more afraid/worried to be out in my own home, which is super-duper dissonant and weird and unhealthy. When that bubbled back up to the surface recently, I broached the topic with him again (not the first time since I originally came out, but not quite commonplace, either).

It did not go well. He became upset and uncomfortable, even tearing up and refusing to look at me, and said he wasn't sure he could ever be comfortable with having a partner who isn't straight-up female. I asked why--again, I don't want surgery or HRT or male pronouns or like literally anything but to feel free to look handsome af every so often--and he started listing all this stuff that, honestly, didn't make much sense to me: What if I decide I want to pack? (So? Then I get a silicone dick and I pack. You don't have to touch it.) What if I feel masculine on our wedding day? (Well, wedding dresses are expensive. My fluidity isn't so uncontrollable that I'll say ""fuck it"" to $1k and go for slacks instead.)

I answered these questions as best I could and he was still really upset. So I told him to continue asking any questions or voicing any concerns as they came up, and that I'd answer to the best of my ability. Since then, I've been gently referring him to blogs and articles and the like from both genderfluid people and their cis partners, hoping something would resonate and that his discomfort might just be from fear of the unknown, so to speak. 

That also hasn't really worked. To his credit, he's been way better about broaching the topic and responding to me when I send him a resource, but it hasn't actually changed his response: he always, to some degree, panics, and reiterates that he isn't sure he can be comfortable with it (though he says he is willing to try).

What do I do? I've, of course, been doing some reading of my own by non-binary folks who have had similar experiences. They're all similar: Not understanding but being willing to learn is one thing. Not accepting, not respecting, or being uncomfortable with is another, and you should cut your losses.

Guys, I love this man. But I can't marry someone who isn't going to be able to support and accept my identity. I want to explore myself (I'm only 25, for goodness' sake) and experiment with binding and packing and all that good stuff, without feeling like my partner is actively grossed out.

Any advice? I can't stop crying. It's totally my fault for not pushing the issue three years ago, and lesson learned. But still, this SUCKS.

My fluidity isn\'t so uncontrollable that I\'ll say ""fuck it"" to $1k and go for slacks instead.)\n\nI answered these questions as best I could and he was still really upset. So I told him to continue asking any questions or voicing any concerns as they came up, and that I\'d answer to the best of my ability. Since then, I\'ve been gently referring him to blogs and articles and the like from both genderfluid people and their cis partners, hoping something would resonate and that his discomfort might just be from fear of the unknown, so to speak. \n\nThat also hasn\'t really worked. To his credit, he\'s been way better about broaching the topic and responding to me when I send him a resource, but it hasn\'t actually changed his response: he always, to some degree, panics, and reiterates that he isn\'t sure he can be comfortable with it (though he says he is willing to try).\n\nWhat do I do? I\'ve, of course, been doing some reading of my own by non-binary folks who have had similar experiences. They\'re all similar: Not understanding but being willing to learn is one thing. Not accepting, not respecting, or being uncomfortable with is another, and you should cut your losses.\n\nGuys, I love this man. But I can\'t marry someone who isn\'t going to be able to support and accept my identity. I want to explore myself (I\'m only 25, for goodness\' sake) and experiment with binding and packing and all that good stuff, without feeling like my partner is actively grossed out.\n\nAny advice? I can\'t stop crying. It\'s totally my fault for not pushing the issue three years ago, and lesson learned. But still, this SUCKS.

So my situation is this: AMAB, 22yo and I think I'm genderfluid. I don't know exactly when this started, I got involved in some light bdsm and by last summer I sometimes felt a desire to be feminized. 

And it's kind of all come to a head lately when I realised that this isn't just a kink, the idea of presenting as female really appeals to me. 

Unfortunately my situation means that I can't buy female clothing, or really alter my appearance in any meaningful way right now. But I'm hoping that will change completely before the end of the year :)

So why am I looking for friends? Well part of me feels that if I can't dress or look the way I'd like to sometimes, well at least it would be nice if I got to act more feminine when I felt that way. I want to get to know this new person inside of me, what her interests are, how she acts with other people. And I feel like she's missed out a 22 years of life experiences, that the male side of me knows nothing about.  

So while this offer of friendship of course extends to anyone interested, I'm definitely looking to get more female experiences :)

(And in case you're put off my the newness of this account, I just set it up because the last one I used was too associated with the kink stuff. I don't want that to be an influence over my identity going forward. Thanks for understanding :)
