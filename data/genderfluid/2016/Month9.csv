Let's say your Bob. Bob is a male who likes to wear dresses and pink wigs on some days but likes to wear dress shirts and wears his hair short on others.

2016-09-11 19:09:13,52a3p3,4,9,"So I've recently been trying to get a better understand of myself in terms of gender and sexuality. I would say that I essentially identify as a pansexual, gender to me hasn't ever really mattered and I just see people for who they are.

But I have been thinking lately that I do remember being a ""tomboy"" growing up, and I do remember I got to a stage where I felt more comfortable dressed down and in darker colours, wearing boyshort type underwear and even purchased a boy's top that I liked. I've always felt if I happened to be a boy, I know what I'd want my name to be too. 

I did used to dress quite feminine but I've always wanted to (and did) wear a suit to a big event. When I am socialising with a group of guys, a moment might occur where I ""remember"" that I'm female and it's almost confusing to me. There are times where I am treated as a female and it confuses me despite the fact I identify as female.

But I am comfortable in my own body unless I am dressed overtly feminine (something short, with a lot of skin on show). Or during that time of the month which I can loathe. Sometimes I don't like how curvy and feminine I look. I do things that are associated often with men (I'm not a good cook, I used to swear all the time, I enjoy football, I strive to be strong and independent etc) but I am also trying to overcome some internalised misogyny and realise that women can do and be all of the above too. 

But I just wonder if what's happening is on my ""dress down"" days, that's me connecting to my more masculine side. I am currently dating a guy who I am sometimes jealous for being male, and I often see things he does and wears that I wish I could. But I worry that he will find it odd if I suddenly start to explore/express my potentially gender fluid identity. Any advice would be really appreciated!

I'm pretty sure as a kid my face sometimes, according to my peers, made me look masculine or something, I don't know.

Another thing is, my name. I have a typically female name and I want to change it to another typically female name, with some gender-neutral middle names.

This isn't a huge issue because I'll figure this out, like the rest of this stuff...

Can anyone give me some advice? I know I'll be fine but I just feel weird. Is it normal to feel weird and scared about this? I just don't feel very normal. I never thought that I'd have such a weird, hard journey with my sexuality and myself. I actually hate this. I just feel so confused. I lied, I don't know if I will be fine. I feel fucked up.

2016-09-17 16:40:41,537yun,2,3,"I have recently taken to thinking of gender presentation as a form of a mask. To me, man, woman, cis, trans, genderfluid, genderqueer, or non-binary (or whatever other labels come up), are all a mask.

For me, I've tried having a more masculine mask in life. I can be interested enough in sports to have a decent time at a Super Bowl party or hanging out with friends watching a baseball game or a football game or something. I just don't feel like, when it comes to what most people think of when they think ""man"" I fit into that. I've tried to be more like that, and it makes unhappy.

Now, as for a feminine mask, I have certain physical attributes that make a feminine presentation a little hard to obtain. My hairline is very male. My face is kinda male. My body, despite some feminine leanings, is that of a guy's. I've made peace with this though.

What I talk about when I say I like the idea of having a feminine mask, it isn't the same as wanting to be a woman. Yes, there are times I want to be a woman, but they aren't as frequent as the times I feel like neither a man or a woman. I do like the flexibility aspect, however.

Not saying they don't catch crap, but women can typically express greater fluidity in their appearance and still be seen as ""normal women."" This is what I talk about when I say I have a more feminine identity, since I feel like femininity has a greater range of expression potential than masculinity, as femininity can borrow from masculinity a lot easier than the other way around.

I am finally getting to a point where I am feeling like I need to express myself more. It isn't a matter of necessarily ""finding myself,"" but that's a part of it. No, this is me saying ""I have always liked this stuff, I am just now allowing myself to actually express a like of it.""

I'm a AMAB, and the first times I remember feeling wrong with my gender was when I was about five or six, when I wanted to play pretending I was a girl hero, or sometimes wanted toys that were ""girl stuff"". Of course, coming from a conservative family, I was quickly reprehended. 

Because when you're a child your gender doesn't influence all that much, I didn't think about or felt wrong, except on specific cases. Anyway, that was until I was around twelve.

I did felt attraction for the male and specially his penis, and that was really confusing back then. For months I wouldn't let myself enjoy that out of guilt that a stupid society and religion had made me feel. Anyway, I tried watching gay porn to see if I would enjoy that, and I found out I didn't. And that was when I realized I didn't just want to have sex with a male, but I wanted to BE the female. I've been enjoying imagining myself as a female since then.

I'm very attracted to women, both sexually and romantically, and although I have a sexual attraction for men I've never felt romantically attracted for one.

Before I moved, I had a sizeable wardrobe that ranged from very traditionally feminine dresses to normal jeans and t shirts. On the days that I'd feel much more comfortable dressed masculine (at least not feminine), I'd wear jeans and a baggy sweatshirt in order to hide my sizeable chest.

I just wore what I felt best represented what I was feeling that day. In the same week, I'd wear a bright pink dress with heels and makeup, and the next day wear loose cut jeans, a baggy sweatshirt and sneakers.
