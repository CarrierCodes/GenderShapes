So, I've been with my girlfriend for around 2 months and we really like each other. However, I haven't seen her for the last 3 weeks because she was ""busy"". She just now told me that she's really confused and bored in the relationship (not sure how she's bored because I'm constantly trying to do some activities with her and adapt to her, but she just denies it). She then said that she's genderfluid and bisexual. She said that she loves me and wants to be with me.

I'm 1000000% openminded about this and I gave her a couple days to figure herself out, but I still need some advice on how to handle this and such.

2016-10-11 16:48:13,56yzbx,12,10,"I'd like to start by saying I definitely posted here about a month ago and I'm super grateful for the support that I have had. 

So I've been making a conscious effort to educate myself on identities, terms etc. I had been watching a lot of videos made by transgendered males over the past few months anyways. Videos on how to know you're transgender, if you're not etc. The initial process has been anxiety inducing for obvious reasons but I think I had a moment of clarity last night.

It's by my understanding that trans men see themselves as men but feel their body isn't quite right. They feel they should be seeing a ""man's body"" but what they see doesn't reflect that. I think what got me was that I can relate to this. 

Something I definitely do now I'm questioning/newly identifying is to try and look at myself in the mirror but I also try and picture my body as a man's. But it's incredibly hard because obviously that's technically different from what I'm seeing. 

There are times when I see my body and think, it looks so much like a woman's. It's too feminine and it feels off. I can't describe it. I believe this might be gender dysphoria? I'm not sure. I have been diagnosed with body image distortions by a therapist in terms of my size as it is. I also feel a pang when I am addressed as terms such as 'lady', 'miss', 'madam' or 'she'. It feels almost as if I'm being insulted in a weird way?

So I'm trying to experiment. I know what name I would go by when presenting as a male (although I don't mind being called that or my birth name) and that I know I have the desperate urge to dress more masculine. I am of course both nervous and scared because I've always been a bit of a tomboy since my late teens but now this is another level as I will be hoping to bind. I hear this is also deemed as transitioning too?

I've tried to wear things that hide my figure more and I instantly feel more comfortable. For a long time I thought I suffered from self esteem issues but I'm wondering if it's actually been gender dysphoria. The constant awareness that I have a very feminine looking figure.

I've tried to answer the question of ""if I could choose to wake up the next day as the opposite gender, would I?"". I think the answer is yes. If that meant I was 100% happy within myself and stopped questioning my gender identity and expression, then yes. I would be male. But then there'd be drawbacks in terms of having the dysphoria again of wanting the option to bear children.

So I hope you can see why I'm conflicted. I was wondering if genderfluid/nonbinary people do transition? If so, how do you decide what is enough to stop the dysphoria for the gender you feel, if you feel more than one? Any personal experiences would also be great to hear!

My adam's apple has gotten more prominent from T and while at first I liked it, now it's making me nervous. I can't tell if it's a dysphoria thing or the standard ""no one will like me if I'm a he/she-looking freak"" feeling. That really gets to me considering I was really androgynous most of my childhood and then went through a super femme presenting phase and I can't help but be aware of the fact that people seemed to like me more when I was en femme.

But I do wish my adam's apple were less prominent. To be fair, it was already pretty prominent for an AFAB person pre-T. And it's not enough for me to want to stop T because I like the way T makes me feel, I like getting random boners and not being so quick to tear up and being as physically strong as I always thought I was (which has gotten me into trouble in the past). I like that my face is more hollowed out. I like cumming like a guy. I like the way my chest looks and I like my growing happy trail. I like my voice so much more now (though I've been practicing my girlmode vs. boymode voices now that I actually have the range for both). 

But my adam's apple makes me really self-conscious. And my hair (or lack thereof) makes me really self-conscious too.

And I kind of want to shave my legs, but feel like I ""can't"" because I'm supposed to be masculine. I want to wear skirts and makeup and feel ashamed of that because it's like I'm betraying my transness somehow.

I can tell I've internalized a lot of the shitty things people have said about me and NB people because sometimes when I'm in boymode I feel like I must just be a trans guy who feels guilty for betraying women and is trying to cling to his past, and sometimes in girlmode I feel like I'm just a cis girl who's fooled herself into thinking she's trans because of body issues or because she wanted to jump on the transwagon.

Previously I was on Effexor (both pre-T and after starting it) and didn't really have this problem. [Side note: I first identified as genderfluid when I discovered the term at age 12 or so, and am 20 now, and before that I thought I had a ""half boy, half girl brain"", and because I had a vanishing twin in the womb I wondered whether I was a boy/girl chimera, and I expressed a desire for puberty blockers at age 10 before I even knew what they were, so this is not at all an ambiguous case of genderfluidity.]

When I was first starting puberty I also used to have more dramatic shifts, but as I got older they mellowed out and I've largely felt ""somewhere in the middle"", kind of wavering between masc- and femme-leaning modes. For the months leading up to testosterone I felt so steadily male-leaning with only occasional fluctuation (and it didn't really feel so much as going back to ""female"" as just not being particularly male... so agender/neutral days I guess) that I began to wonder whether I was just a gender nonconforming trans guy in denial.

Which brings me to a few weeks ago, when I started my new meds. The flipping is out of control. I have gone from feeling almost totally female and confused and questioning whether this means I have to detransition and if I'm suddenly going to be a girl forever now to back to male, dysphoria and all, and feeling like I'm clearly just a binary trans guy in denial who just feels too guilty about being male/is too much of a pussy to transition and that I should go on full-dose testosterone so I can get the full effects. I ended up halving my usual dose of T when I entered girlmode out of fear and then when I swung back into guymode I regretted it because I already have dysphoria about being soft and skinny and I felt like I had shot myself in the foot by halving it.

And, even more confusingly, I have found myself experiencing a significant amount of ""mixed"" states-- not the more comfortable, in the middle feeling I used to have, but a clear sense of being BOTH male and female at the same time and feeling distressed about being trapped in a body that can only do one thing and feeling like each side just wants to kill the other so I can just be one thing and be in peace.

This is killing me. Could it be the medication? Or is it just normal fluctuations in gender and dysphoria that's being made worse by depression/loneliness/shitty self-esteem?

I'd like to think that I'm a very open and accepting person when it comes to the way people want to define themselves.

I have, for a number of years, been supportive of a close friend that's redefined they're whole identity.  Gender identity wasn't the only change, but it was a big part of it.  They've also gone through so many changes on how they expect everyone to conduct themselves around them and how they expect to be treated.  It's been exhausting, to say the least, in rewiring myself to think in the ways that this person fells the most comfortable.

Within the last year, they went through a legal name change to redefine that part of their life (while also trying to run/hide from people in their 'former life').  Only a few of us in their life have been lucky enough to survive this 'purge and redefine' as they continue to shape a new life in a new city and home and everything.

The name change was something that I thought would be the hardest thing to get used to, since they've always been X to me, but want to be called Y now.  Again, it was mentally and emotionally exhausting to deal with, but I managed to make the change in my life and speech to accommodate.

2016-10-27 05:43:41,59mfsk,17,10,"In a nutshell, it's much easier said than done.  I'm at the point in my life at the ripe old age of 35 to where I have accepted that I am very much gender fluid and non binary.  Even so, I feel that there are number of blockers in my life, some real and some thrown up by my subconscious, that keep me from living a fully authentic life.  There's also some questions about how I would ideally envision my own body in terms of gender.

So the big one is dating and relationships.  The best way to identify sexually for me is ""queer heterosexual"" since I'm attracted to cis women, post op trans women, and DFAB gender fluid types, but I'm clearly not a run of the mill straight dude.  I want to be able be my full authentic self when I'm ""in the market"" or if I'm partnered, but it feels like dating and relationships can be a volatile shit show at times.  I feel like I have be more butch than I am authentically am in order to attract a partner.  If I meet someone while presenting more masculine, I know there will be the ""day of reckoning"" when I come out, which makes me want to overachieve in some ways to show my best possible qualities that don't necessarily have to do with gender.  If I meet someone while presenting more andro or femme, I always wonder if any attraction will be carried on, they are treating me as some kind of joke, etc.  I know a lot of it is me, and it also has a lot to do with looking for love, sex, and relationships in the wrong places.  I would love to hear from other AMABs, as well as female (bodied) partners of AMABs how they've found and met each other.

The second big blocker is professional.  In saying this, I am in the IT industry in Seattle, so I am fortunate enough to be in a fairly progressive environment overall.  It still doesn't make it easy though.  I want to be able to be my more authentic self on the job rather than presenting as ""masculine enough to where people don't ask many questions"".  But I have a morbid, and at times seemingly rational, fear that coming out and presenting more andro to femme at work can bring a slew of problems.  I somehow know that day will eventually come, and much like how I go about dating when I met someone when presenting as more masculine, I find myself striving to be damn good at what I do, because I know that if shit hits the fan because of gender issues, I have that as a defense.  But if any other AMAB has been able to do a non binary transition or be their more authentic self on the job with (mostly) positive results, once again, I want to hear their tips and tricks.  That said, you don't have to have a ""Cinderella"" story for me to think you've done well.

The last is about my body, and a possible non binary transition of sorts.  I don't have a fundamental problem with being physically male for the most part, though I do find some parts frustrating and at times mildly dysphoric.  I feel that ideally, I would love to have more hips and butt (a waist to hip ratio between male and female would put me on cloud 9), less body hair, mable not as much upper body bulk, and be able to be more female like graceful.  I KNOW I already have shit hot legs and can rock the right dress or skirt like it's nobody's business.  But I do like having the male brute strength when I need it, I'd be ambivalent at best about having breasts, and don't want the ability to use my penis for sex to take a hit.  Those would be some good reasons for me to question going on HRT, though I wouldn't completely rule it out if there is a possible dosage that can work well for me.  I know I can achieve less body hair through laser, and I have nothing to worry about in the leg department.  But I don't know what to do about the hips/butt part.  Some can be acheived through diet and exercise, but I want a bit of curve action going on when I get into a nice form fitting dress.  So I'd love once again to hear from some other AMAB folks who have gone through some form of non binary transition as to what they've experience and the route they've taken.

2016-10-31 23:16:55,5afqwn,14,4,"hey y'all-- i've been thinking a lot about my gender identity lately, and am not sure whether to identify as trans or genderfluid. to some extent, i know that labels are not as important as understanding one's experience, but i'm curious to get some outside perspective and hear if others can relate to my experience.

i spent my whole childhood obsessively thinking about how i wanted to be a girl, not a boy. when i reached adolescence it turned out i was attracted to girls; my focus shifted to attracting women more than wanting to be one.

more recently i unearthed the childhood experience i'd more or less repressed, and i've been reexamining my gender identity with a lot of curiosity and openness. what i've discovered is that my experience with gender fluctuates though trends far more to the female side of the spectrum. i'd say that if gender were a scale from 1 (female) to 10 (male), most of my time is spent between the 2-5 range, with periodic experiences on the male side between 6-8.

as i write this, it seems obvious that i'm genderfluid, but something about the trans marker often feels more appropriate, as i do feel pretty female, at least a lot of the time, and have since a pretty young age.
