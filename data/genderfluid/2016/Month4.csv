Is there anyone here who identifies as fluid but doesn't get bad dysphoria?  I've heard of people having panic attacks and things like that.  It's not like that for me.  I feel wrong sometimes, but I still get by and get through the day.  Does this mean I'm not really fluid, that my gender identity is actually static and not that far off from my body, and I just haven't identified what it is?

When I'm feeling more strongly feminine, it can make me uncomfortable, especially around mirrors or in the bathroom.  I am just not seeing the person I want to see.  Being around other women makes me really self-conscious about how I don't look like them, and there's that nagging voice in the back of my head that tells me it's futile to even try.  ""You are NOT a woman and you never will be.  Give it up, just admit you're a man.""  If I can keep busy (like diving into code at work), it's not too bad, but if I get away from that I can start to feel distracted or nervous.  I sometimes find myself pacing around daydreaming about my female self.  I can still function, though, it's just not a fun day.

This manifested yesterday when I was shopping for clothes in the women's section.  Picking stuff off the rack I felt like a kid in a candy store (side note: I finally understand why a lot of women love shopping for clothes and shoes), but I found myself deliberately avoiding any mirrors so I wouldn't see the hairy flat-chested little goblin intruding on women's spaces.  When I went to try things on, that was the worst.  Even if I liked the clothes, I felt hideous.  I didn't see female me in the mirror, I just saw an ugly man trying on dresses.  I think part of it is that I still have a beard and body hair, and feminine me doesn't have those those things in my head.  That makes it hard to see her in the mirror.

Is this a form of dysphoria?  Or is it my brain just telling me that I'm cis, and I'm not listening?  Or is it just a plain old body image issue, like cis people face every day, and has nothing to do with my gender identity?  My male self definitely has those issues, but this is... different somehow.

I've struggled with feeling like a fraud, and like I'm just trying to convince myself I'm fluid so I have a fancy sounding label to justify things I might be subconsciously ashamed of.  My lack of dysphoria is one big thing that's holding me back from fully accepting being fluid.  I am also struggling to separate my identity from my body - I don't know if that's dysphoria in itself or just a sign that I'm cisgender.

About two months ago I was suffering from a lot of dysphoria and I felt like a freak because I wasn't ""full"" trans and I didn't really want to transition. So I looked up different resources and stats and stuff but that really didn't help, then I started looking up pictures of genderfluid people and I came across a random comic strip about genderfluidity. But it was really short and it helped a lot so I started scouring the net for any other genderfluid related comics and I finally found a comic called Rain. Rain is mainly about a MTF highschooler and her adventures but it also covers everything from genderfluidity to asexuality. The character that I really related to was Ky/Kylie, they are genderfluid and in my opinion very accurately depicted.

2016-04-06 02:17:59,4djsu7,10,3,"Ever since I was little, I thought I had transgender tendencies,  but  nowadays, i've had shifts of being comfortable with the gender I was born into and wanting to be the opposite gender.  I found out in 2014 about the genderfluid identity and was curious about it.

I saw on YouTube a lot of people set the standards of gender fluidity being either this person who will get pissed off if you don't use the right pronouns  to what they're feeling that particular time of day to a person wearing a mix/match of clothing geared towards men and women.

Personally, I haven't really been the one to be upset about people not getting my pronouns wrong, I'm very tolerant.

I'm Jamie Tristan Folaigh, or at least that's what I'm feeling right now. All three names are ""fictions"" though, with one being a last name specifically created for social media purposes.

I'm 26, AMAB, and genderfluid, pronouns don't matter. I'm clearly AMAB if you see me in person, but I don't always identify with ""he/him"" pronouns, hence the username (genderfluid*chick*, I strongly prefer the idea of expressing myself typically middle ground, but having a center that is more feminine of center than masculine of center, if that makes sense).

I've always felt like I didn't connect fully with guys or girls in a consistent manner. My first big indication that I was different was, at a young age, like six, I distinctly remember that I didn't like the word ""handsome"" being applied to me. Looking back at old photos, there might be a slight confirmation bias being applied, but I can see why kids might have wondered if I was gay or something.

I know that I'm not gay, not because I can't find guys attractive, I just can't see myself sleeping with one. In that same vein, I don't recall looking at girls the same way I remember hearing guys talk about them.

For as long as I can remember, I have found things like girls jeans and underwear to be more comfortable, and have desired a more middle-ground or even slightly feminine presentation (like, sometimes, using girly tops or skirts and stuff). I know that pushing the envelope too far is impossible given certain physical attributes I have (thinning hair, kinda masculine shoulder build, kinda masculine face).

Perhaps the biggest things that block me from pushing the envelope too far are the aforementioned physical issues (which aren't that big a deal in the long run) for one. For another there is the fact that my social network is composed entirely of people who know me as a guy and would probably be destroyed if I was to come out in this manner. That and the idea that, even though I am not too far from Atlanta, I am far enough from it that people (including potential romantic interests) would tend to not be interested in me (and, I feel, potentially aggressive) if I was to come out in this manner.

This is a bit of an introduction and question post...


My names Dave (Sophie is my fem name), I'm a 27 year old (born male). I recently started going out with a new girlfriend who is very open minded and I let her know that I had these feelings that I had a feminine side. She took me out shopping a few weeks ago and I've since had a few days as a girl (including going out in public for meals). I don't feel like I'm ready to 100% transition and right now I feel like a female some days and male other days, which led me to discover that I was likely gender fluid. It's so refreshing to finally get this out of my system and be open about who I am.


Now for the question, how did you guys come out to your work colleagues/family and how long did it take? I'm guessing just coming to work one day as Sophie might be a little too extreme?


I would love to connect with like minded people, so please feel free to message me privately.

2016-04-14 03:31:14,4epcq3,5,7,"A few years ago I came to terms with being genderfluid - it wasn't a huge event, there was no big coming out thing, it was more of just I woke up one day and went 'yes this is right'. Never gave it much of a second though because it felt correct. 

Fast forward to now. After a lot of soul searching and such, I had come to terms that I'm transgendered, about a year or so ago, and I've been on hormones for almost 2 months. I've still been mostly identifying as genderfluid, although as of late, the more I hear the Him's and Sir's, the more I notice how I don't really appreciate it. Like everytime I hear a cashier give me the ""Have a good day sir"", it just seems to sound louder than the rest, and it just keeps ringing in my ears where I almost physically cringe away. It always leaves me in some metaphorical daze. 


Among friends I'm open to whatever pronouns they choose to use for me, and it's less of a 'i'm happy with what you use' and closer to a 'i honestly don't care because it's not a big deal'. But if it's strangers, family, people I don't know or barely know, it just hits me so much harder. I don't know how to describe it other than the way a friend says 'he' and the way someone else says 'he' is ages different. The way friends say 'he' sounds simply offhanded ways to refer to me, but the way strangers say 'he' sounds almost spiteful I'd go as far as to say. 


the whole reason I chose to identify as Genderfluid is because I personally did not care how I presented, or how others saw me. Gender wasn't a part of any equation, it wasn't relevant, never mattered, could not have existed for all I cared. It was just a way for someone to identify me for their own comfort.

I've been wondering if maybe I've been calling myself genderfluid under the impression that I felt more ""anything goes, I don't care because I'll be under that spectrum somewhere"", but now I'm starting to think that maybe I just misinterpreted it as ""I don't identify as anything really, but that just seems close enough because it's easier to explain""?

Never gave it much of a second though because it felt correct. \n\nFast forward to now. After a lot of soul searching and such, I had come to terms that I\'m transgendered, about a year or so ago, and I\'ve been on hormones for almost 2 months. I\'ve still been mostly identifying as genderfluid, although as of late, the more I hear the Him\'s and Sir\'s, the more I notice how I don\'t really appreciate it. Like everytime I hear a cashier give me the ""Have a good day sir"", it just seems to sound louder than the rest, and it just keeps ringing in my ears where I almost physically cringe away. It always leaves me in some metaphorical daze. \n\n\nAmong friends I\'m open to whatever pronouns they choose to use for me, and it\'s less of a \'i\'m happy with what you use\' and closer to a \'i honestly don\'t care because it\'s not a big deal\'. But if it\'s strangers, family, people I don\'t know or barely know, it just hits me so much harder. I don\'t know how to describe it other than the way a friend says \'he\' and the way someone else says \'he\' is ages different. The way friends say \'he\' sounds simply offhanded ways to refer to me, but the way strangers say \'he\' sounds almost spiteful I\'d go as far as to say. \n\n\nthe whole reason I chose to identify as Genderfluid is because I personally did not care how I presented, or how others saw me. Gender wasn\'t a part of any equation, it wasn\'t relevant, never mattered, could not have existed for all I cared. It was just a way for someone to identify me for their own comfort. A way to have someone to refer to me that was easy for them. But now I\'m feeling like it\'s not the same. As if something is different, even though nothing changed.

2016-04-22 22:41:08,4g0wid,4,12,"Hey everyone, I just found this subreddit and it seems right up my alley... at least I think so!

I was born female and grew up loving lots of ""tomboy"" stuffs and only really enjoyed female societal norms when it came to wearing dresses (because who doesn't love not wearing pants in public sometimes!?). My gender was never really a thing I thought about, and although my mom had wanted a really girly girl, both of my parents were pretty good at not forcing me to be one thing or another. I was happy with my gender neutral self.

Things changed rather a lot come puberty time, though, when I found out that I would be a super curvy woman. It was pretty exciting at first, buying special clothes and starting to look like some grown ups do. Then I found out what else happens when people see those curves: they stop talking with you about books and video games and start asking you about boyfriends and makeup. I think I became a little less confident in myself and it was, at least partially, because of the way that people treat me now, post-puberty. It's so very different than what I experienced as a flat-as-a-board human.

I never really minded my body, boobs and all (although I still think it would be really cool if I could grow a full beard!), but the thing that makes me question my gender is my mind. I find myself connecting a lot more mentally with those of the masculine or even more ""neutral"" gender and tend to get stressed when hanging out with super feminine types for long periods of time. It really rustles my jimmies when strangers assume I prefer feminine things or have feminine traits, but I'm also fairly sure that would rustle any AFAB person's jimmies, so perhaps that isn't so weird.

TLDR: I don't think I have body dysmorphia, but it does bother me that my naturally super feminine body makes it harder to be outwardly gender neutral in our society.

2016-04-23 20:55:04,4g58ku,1,13,"I ,as you may have guessed, am gender fluid. If you don't know what this is I will give a brief definition, this may not be how every person who identifies as gender fluid feels, so I am speaking from only my feelings. Ok so gender fluid for me is being a boy and a girl, some days i feel feminine and some days i feel masculine, some days i even feel like i am both but mixed together. Most of the time i feel more like a boy than a girl and to answer most people's questions i was born a female. The ways how i show what gender i feel i will dress either more femininly or more masculinly. when i feel both a boy and a girl at the same time i will; wear my binder, wear a skirt, and wear no make-up. this way i am a confusin to society and people cant really tell what i am. 

What i would like to talk about is my story of how i came to discovour my gender. 
when i was younger, every since i can remember i didn't see people as girls and boys, i just saw everyone as people. i thought everyone was the same and i didn't see myself as a girl. I just saw everyone and myself as people. i kept thinking like this until my first year of high school, i was 11. High school was not a very nice place for me, i got bullied a lot because i didn't look really girly and i didn't wear make-up like all the popular girls in my class. This didn't really bother me because i moved to a new high school 3 months after i started. However the bullying at this school was worse. I did have one friend at the time and she is still my friend now, unfortunatly, because we were so close I got accused of being a lesbian, the funny thing is she actually came out as being a lesbian 2 years ago. Anyway i am getting off topic.
At first i thought that i was bisexual and nothing else, i actually regret telling people that because i later discovoured that i am pansexual and once again i was bullied for being ""bi"". I have to apologize to anyone who's education is set out in a different form than mine, i am British. So when i was in year 8 , my second year of high school, i had a wave of feeling like i was a boy, i didn't know what to do, i didn't know who i could talk to and i felt so unhappy with my body. I felt like this for a while, like 4 months. Then i felt female again, so i thought, ""it was just a phase"". I was happy that i wouldn't have to tell my family that i wanted to be a boy. In year 9 i started falling for a boy in the year below me, so i forced myself to be feminine because i wanted him to like me..fast forward to when we actually started dating, it turned out that he isn't straight and he loves me for who i am and supports me, we are still together now and have been for 2 years now. so next i started feeling like a mix of a boy and a girl. i did some research and even discovoured Ruby Rose. this is how i realised that i am gender fluid. Now my main aim is to slowely tell the close people in my life, my big sister, little brother and a couple of close friends know, but i am hoping i will become brave enough to tell my judgmental father who will hopefully accept and support his little princess/prince. 

I hope i have helped other people who are still searching for their gender and i hope this has also made people aware of gender fluid.

For example I made the choice when I was about 9 or 10 to grow out my hair and it has been long ever since but because of that I have done things to counteract how feminine of a trait that is. The biggest thing I have done is as soon as I could grow a beard (15-16) I did and I have had it for about 3-4 years straight now, it isn't very long (Like an inch or two) or big (Just on my chin) but it successfully makes it easy to identify that I am Biologically male presenting as such.

For this analogy the crystals are the feminine side of me and the water is the masculine, they have separate physical properties when they are apart but together they clearly make juice. I hope this doesn't make absolutely no sense).
