2016-12-06 22:38:14,5gw1gp,2,5,"I'm 30, AMAB [to use the jargon you use here - in keeping with target audience - I was born male basically], from the United Kingdom.

A long time ago [well, around November 2004 and March 2005 when I was a student] I experimented with crossdressing/androgyny but it never got very far. I did this probably to challenge my own gender norms and simply because it seemed something new [I was 18/19 at the time, and students experiment with things].

The clothes I experimented with were feminine - but only got as far as women's jumpers / crop tops / athletic wear and leggings in charity shops [they were the only places that seemed accepting of this in late 2004 / mid-2005 - back then, the term genderfluid was unknown to me]. They felt good and it was more like a feeling of comfort from the clothes - not a sexual or fetish reason.

The crossdressing was not done for any fetishistic or sexual reasons but only as experimentation.

I could be genderfluid - but although I identify as male [most of the time], I have also identified as female too [so that could probably make me bi-gender, technically]. I do have a female alter-ego as such but she has no real change from me - same interests, same sort of personality, only the aesthetic changes. In terms of pronouns - it's he for male form [as I am now], she for when female form [instead of they which is gender-neutral since I'm technically identifying as both - at least from my point of view].

My interests are traditionally considered as masculine - automobiles, computing, web design and I have traits considered as masculine - strong, active, clumsy but I also I have traits traditionally considered as feminine - sensitive, accepting, kind, gentle but I don't act effeminate or over-masculine. I'm just in the middle of those two. My day job requires the feminine sort of traits [I can't talk much about it due to Data Protection Act 2003, all I can say is it involves working with vulnerable adults].

If I am genderfluid, then so be it - it's 2016, and I shouldn't have to worry about this. OK, so I will probably look like a butch lesbian stereotype in physical terms due to my face being very masculine-looking and my hair [very masculine style] but that is OK with me.

I do worry about how this will affect my dating / relationships - I am attracted to women who are very feminine / girly-girl sort of behaviour/interests. I do not know what sort of woman would be attracted to this and for obvious reasons have never told my friends about this.

I haven't experimented much with genderfluidity really for these reasons:

- I live at home with my parents and am financially dependent on them [and they do not know, probably because it's a question of whether they need to know yet and/or I am too embarrassed to tell them].

-  My area is a fairly conservative one [near Skelmersdale/Wigan] with an older population, no LGBT ""scene"" or people to talk to on this in my area.

-  I only learnt about gender fluidity a few years ago.

Admittedly - this is experimentation with a way of expressing myself - but I am not really sure how to go about this safely - changing rooms in shops [for instance] since it is new to me.

David Bowie [who I am a fan of] presented as androgynous - but it is coincidental - this has nothing to do with me experimenting.

I know for a fact I am not transgender, but bi-gender [if that is the correct term] may be the word.

2016-12-30 10:39:03,5l2ufp,12,4,"Hi r/genderfluid,I had originally posted this to r/asktransgender but it didn't get much of a response. I am currently a very confused, scared and worried 19 year old male from the UK. I have been obsessing over the question of ""Am I transgender?"".  Doing so makes me feel more depressed and generally anxious but I can't really stop worrying about it because it's such a huge thing. In short, over the past few years, I have swung from answering yes and no to the question above without ever really feeling like I've got an answer. There are cases when I do come to some sort of a conclusion that I'm not trans, and for a while, I feel this sense of relief wash over me, and I feel like I finally can go on with my life. Usually this happiness and optimism doesn't last that long though before I go back to questioning. And I mean it's pretty obvious why I'm still questioning - I can't really deny the fact that I have had fantasies about becoming a woman. And from what I've read here, no cisgender person does that, meaning I must be transgender, and that sort of sends me into a panic, it's scary, and weird, this idea that I'm transgender. And the cycle kind of goes on.
My problem is that I don't feel like I fit the category for cisgender, but I don't really feel like I fit the category for transgender either. I kind of feel half-trans and half-cis, though I know it doesn't really work like that haha. I'll try and give some examples. I've seen the idea that I might be genderfluid suggested a few times so I wondered if this resonates with anyone here.

As I've said, the biggest thing suggesting that I am trans is that I've had fantasies, exciting fantasies, about becoming a woman. Most of the time, these are sexual in nature, but if I am being honest to myself, I know there are times when it has not been just sexual. Instead, these fantasies can make me feel happy or calm. Even when the stories are sexual in nature, I've noticed the most exciting parts for me are when a male character experiences some detail that only a real woman could feel or experience. In particular, I have once or twice felt a particular thrill when imagining myself as an actual girl - i.e. imagining I was born as a girl or something. I haven't had any obvious dysphoria - physical, social, to the extent where it was kind of self evident - but looking back on my teenage years, and even in my recent past, there is this mild sense of something not feeling right - kind of not feeling like a real person, a bit depressed, just going through the motions. Sometimes I've thought that my personality, shy, generally a bit more feminine than other guys in terms of not being aggressive, being a bit more caring and kind, might have made me a 'better' girl than a boy. So sometimes being a girl would mean I would have less pressure on me.

All of this makes me sound pretty trans. But I'm confused by the other side of it. Essentially, if I could sum it up in one sentence, it would be that on the inside, there is at least part of me, if not most of me, that feels like a guy. I don't mean this in a bad way at all, but in a good way. I mean this in the sense that I feel like a really important part of my identity is that I am a guy. And sometimes, I feel more in touch with this guy part of me, and I start feeling good about myself. I start feeling like more of a real person again, it's almost like I've remembered who I am. As a kid, I never had any transgender feelings, I was just living as myself, and I was happy, and when I feel like I described above, I feel like a kid again, happy, optimistic, looking forward to the future. And it's stuff like the fact that I like to look good as a guy - the better I look the better I feel about myself. Like for example I like male clothing. I feel like if I was trans then I wouldn't actually care how I looked as a guy, because it wouldn't make me feel better. Sometimes, when I look at the changes that HRT brings on timeline and stuff, I think about how I would feel weird if those changes happened to my body. Sometimes in the mirror my body looks to have a bit more a feminine shape and I don't really like how it looks. And I think about my current life, about the elements of it that are determined by my gender, like how I interact with people, and I think I quite like it. I mean, thinking about it, I genuinely like parts of being a guy. Like, how a relative might say that I'm looking handsome, or talking to a girl as a guy, as opposed to what I imagine its like talking to a girl as a girl. The thought of being a father in the future, as well, is a nice one. What I'm kind of saying is that this isn't just a superficial thing, I feel like being a guy has some deeper significance for me.
The other big one is fantasising about sex - like when I fantasise about having sex as a girl, which I have done, it is very arousing and exciting, but never at the end really satisfying, but when I fantasise about having sex as a guy the fantasy seems so much more real (if that makes sense), like I'm not even fantasising about being a specific sex, I'm just imagining having sex as me, and that's easier and more emotionally satisfying to fantasise about. Like when I fantasise about having sex as a girl, I'm just imagining the fantasy, but fantasising about sex as a guy is all about imagining the fantasy actually happening in real life. When I'm in this state of mind, thinking of myself as more manly really turns me on.

The part where this gets really complicated is that I don't know if I'm just saying this stuff to stay in denial - I mean, I think I do genuinely like being a guy, but maybe I would try being a girl and I'd realise I'd love it, that all of the above was just some lie to myself, and that I'd never want to go back. Sometimes it feels inevitable that I'm going to be transgender, which I guess might mean deep down I know I'm transgender, and I'm just trying to avoid it. I'm a bit scared of that happening to be honest, maybe because I think it could happen, though obviously if I did love it I would be happier, which is ultimately what I want. Then again, sometimes I feel at peace and happy when I'm a guy, and the idea that I'm transgender doesn't worry me at all - I just feel secure as a guy. I just feel right. But all this second guessing and doubt makes it impossible to get an answer.

So as you might have guessed I'm kind of all over the place and I've done a lot of thinking about this. I feel like a very divided person, like parts of me are wrestling with one another. I don't really know which of my thoughts or emotions I should listen to. And this is just really messy, especially when you consider all the different things like what actually is identity, reality vs. fantasy, denial etc. so I feel overwhelmed a lot of the time and it gets me down (though writing it out has helped a bit.) I'm kind of just wondering if anyone had been in my situation and found an answer that has given them peace. I really just want to be at peace and be happy, and have an explanation for all my feelings and stuff. And yes, I know, I should look for a therapist, but I'm it very hard to actually make myself do it - maybe because doing so would force to me to acknowledge there is a real issue here for me to address. I guess what it kind of comes down to, in part, is that if I came to the conclusion that, in light of all the evidence, I was transgender, I would be kind of freaked out about what it would mean for my identity. I feel like it would screw all of that up and I don't know how I feel about that. And I kind of feel like while the idea of being a girl is exciting and part of me, if I lost my male identity, I wouldn't really feel grounded in reality, I might not feel like 'me' anymore.

I am currently a very confused, scared and worried 19 year old male from the UK. I have been obsessing over the question of ""Am I transgender?"".  Doing so makes me feel more depressed and generally anxious but I can\'t really stop worrying about it because it\'s such a huge thing. In short, over the past few years, I have swung from answering yes and no to the question above without ever really feeling like I\'ve got an answer. There are cases when I do come to some sort of a conclusion that I\'m not trans, and for a while, I feel this sense of relief wash over me, and I feel like I finally can go on with my life. Usually this happiness and optimism doesn\'t last that long though before I go back to questioning. And I mean it\'s pretty obvious why I\'m still questioning - I can\'t really deny the fact that I have had fantasies about becoming a woman. And from what I\'ve read here, no cisgender person does that, meaning I must be transgender, and that sort of sends me into a panic, it\'s scary, and weird, this idea that I\'m transgender. And the cycle kind of goes on.\nMy problem is that I don\'t feel like I fit the category for cisgender, but I don\'t really feel like I fit the category for transgender either. I kind of feel half-trans and half-cis, though I know it doesn\'t really work like that haha. I\'ll try and give some examples. I\'ve seen the idea that I might be genderfluid suggested a few times so I wondered if this resonates with anyone here.\n\nAs I\'ve said, the biggest thing suggesting that I am trans is that I\'ve had fantasies, exciting fantasies, about becoming a woman. Most of the time, these are sexual in nature, but if I am being honest to myself, I know there are times when it has not been just sexual. Instead, these fantasies can make me feel happy or calm. Even when the stories are sexual in nature, I\'ve noticed the most exciting parts for me are when a male character experiences some detail that only a real woman could feel or experience. In particular, I have once or twice felt a particular thrill when imagining myself as an actual girl - i.e. imagining I was born as a girl or something. I haven\'t had any obvious dysphoria - physical, social, to the extent where it was kind of self evident - but looking back on my teenage years, and even in my recent past, there is this mild sense of something not feeling right - kind of not feeling like a real person, a bit depressed, just going through the motions. Sometimes I\'ve thought that my personality, shy, generally a bit more feminine than other guys in terms of not being aggressive, being a bit more caring and kind, might have made me a \'better\' girl than a boy. So sometimes being a girl would mean I would have less pressure on me.\n\nAll of this makes me sound pretty trans. But I\'m confused by the other side of it. Essentially, if I could sum it up in one sentence, it would be that on the inside, there is at least part of me, if not most of me, that feels like a guy. I don\'t mean this in a bad way at all, but in a good way. I mean this in the sense that I feel like a really important part of my identity is that I am a guy. And sometimes, I feel more in touch with this guy part of me, and I start feeling good about myself. I start feeling like more of a real person again, it\'s almost like I\'ve remembered who I am.
