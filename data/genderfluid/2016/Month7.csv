Some days I feel male, other days I'm female, more like 20/80, 20 percent male 80 percent female, yet I dont identify as trans.

I want to start passing as female but am too scared to use the changing rooms in Select Fashions for fear of being seen as a perv and security guards in shops with radios on thinking I'm a shoplifter.

This is the top I like - http://www.selectfashion.co.uk/clothing/s043-1403-046_black.html but I'm too embarrassed to go in ans try it on let alone buy it.

My feminine side is the same personality as me, no real change in interests, except uber-feminine in look.

I'm attracted to women, not men, both as man and woman.

Officially, I identify as a guy, for work, anyway, but outside of, I'm both.

Chapeltown here in Sheffield isn't great for LGBT, genderfluid, whatever so I need help on this/.

I need to gain some confidence but how can I start to be my true self so to speak?

Anyone here from around my area? I sometimes go up to Pitsmoor and Grenoside but they're not really accepting of LGBT let alone genderfluid people so I hear...

Just need advice from everyone.

I'm 15 and AMAB and have been experiencing minor to moderate dysphoria on and off for most of my life. I discounted it for a long time, even for a couple years after I began encountering and being cool with LGBT people in 2013 or so. About 7 months ago now I decided I was probably genderfluid. In general, I tended to ID as male or female for a few hours or at the most days. But about a month and a half ago, I chose a feminine name and ever since then (well, really a couple hours before then, but y'know), I've identified as female. This is by far the longest amount of time I've been one gender since before I decided I was genderfluid. Is there any time that I should presume I'm not going to identify as male again and simply refer to myself as a transgender woman? If so, when? Any help or info would be appreciated.

2016-07-09 17:19:39,4s18ix,6,10,"Okay, so this might be a bit rambly, and may verge slightly in to NSFW areas...you've been warned.

Right now, this is where I'm at in my gender identity. I like girls clothes. I like being able to be a little femme of center in how I act. I've always preferred a bit more to be in the company of girls than guys, although both can give me dysphoria in some ways.

I'm obviously AMAB, if you saw me in public, there'd be no denying it. My hair suffers from genetic baldness. My shoulders have a bit more masculine of a line to them. My upper half of my body, while not very muscular, is obviously that ""of a man.""

Typically, this part doesn't cause me issues. I, pretty much 100% of the time, like the fact that I don't have boobs to deal with. What I don't like is that my upper arms and shoulders can make a good bit of ""women's"" tops not fit right.

Socially, my obvious AMAB status makes it awkward to want to hang around a bunch of girls, as it serves to present even more of a contrast. Also, living in a more conservative area, where most guys are into cars and sports and crap like that, it sometimes gets awkward being a ""guy"" around a bunch of ""girl talk.""

That being said, I also suffer some dysphoria when I'm around a bunch of guys. Partly it's because I'm reminded of how feminine I really am inside when these guys are discussing things. I also have a bit of a feminine-ish curve (albeit more boyish than girlish at certain points) to my body when you go down from my waist.

I don't tend to hate my body, but when I've been shopping for things like jeans or tops, I'm reminded of how much I don't tend to fit either of the ""norms."" Like, my really thick thighs and somewhat girlish curve means that girls jeans tend to fit better, but seeing the more guyish upper half to my body, I feel kinda stupid at times when wanting to wear girls jeans. I also know that it'd be very easy to spot that I'm wearing them when hanging around with a group of guys and girls.

I've always found myself attracted to girls as well, which makes the hanging out with a group of girls more awkward, especially considering the attitudes that ""girls and guys can't be just friends."" Even though I'm AMAB, when I think about being sexually active, my junk isn't used in the typical AMAB way, at least not primarily. When I think about being sexually active, I think about me being with a girl and focusing less on ""tab a into slot b"" and more on what might be able to be described as typical lesbian actions rather than typical heterosexual actions (the best way I could describe it in a short burst).

Socially, I don't mind my male name nor being referred to as a guy. I'm like, yeah, I've always been ""Name"" and I'm a guy, at least by a binary physical status. I think, realistically, as it relates to presentation, I prefer the identity of ""genderqueer"" but there are times I can feel a bit of shift, enough to feel more or less at ease being associated by company within a group of guys or girls.

Most of my dysphoria doesn't seem to come from direct hatred of my body but rather feeling a shift in myself that sometimes comes from who I'm around. It's like, I get reminded of how much I really am different from the people I'm around.

I could be in the girliest outfit possible, but I see an AFAB girl in a similar outfit and I'm reminded just how stupid I must seem. Alternatively, I could be dressed in the most typical guy fashion, but spend time around guys and be reminded of how much I don't identify or agree with the way that ""guys are"" (I can catch myself thinking ""guys are stupid"" or stuff like that and feel like I'm speaking about guys as a separate group from myself).

My upper half of my body, while not very muscular, is obviously that ""of a man.""\n\nTypically, this part doesn\'t cause me issues. I, pretty much 100% of the time, like the fact that I don\'t have boobs to deal with. What I don\'t like is that my upper arms and shoulders can make a good bit of ""women\'s"" tops not fit right.\n\nSocially, my obvious AMAB status makes it awkward to want to hang around a bunch of girls, as it serves to present even more of a contrast. Also, living in a more conservative area, where most guys are into cars and sports and crap like that, it sometimes gets awkward being a ""guy"" around a bunch of ""girl talk.""\n\nThat being said, I also suffer some dysphoria when I\'m around a bunch of guys. Partly it\'s because I\'m reminded of how feminine I really am inside when these guys are discussing things. I also have a bit of a feminine-ish curve (albeit more boyish than girlish at certain points) to my body when you go down from my waist.\n\nI don\'t tend to hate my body, but when I\'ve been shopping for things like jeans or tops, I\'m reminded of how much I don\'t tend to fit either of the ""norms."" Like, my really thick thighs and somewhat girlish curve means that girls jeans tend to fit better, but seeing the more guyish upper half to my body, I feel kinda stupid at times when wanting to wear girls jeans. I also know that it\'d be very easy to spot that I\'m wearing them when hanging around with a group of guys and girls.\n\nI\'ve always found myself attracted to girls as well, which makes the hanging out with a group of girls more awkward, especially considering the attitudes that ""girls and guys can\'t be just friends."" Even though I\'m AMAB, when I think about being sexually active, my junk isn\'t used in the typical AMAB way, at least not primarily. When I think about being sexually active, I think about me being with a girl and focusing less on ""tab a into slot b"" and more on what might be able to be described as typical lesbian actions rather than typical heterosexual actions (the best way I could describe it in a short burst).\n\nSocially, I don\'t mind my male name nor being referred to as a guy. I\'m like, yeah, I\'ve always been ""Name"" and I\'m a guy, at least by a binary physical status. I think, realistically, as it relates to presentation, I prefer the identity of ""genderqueer"" but there are times I can feel a bit of shift, enough to feel more or less at ease being associated by company within a group of guys or girls.\n\nMost of my dysphoria doesn\'t seem to come from direct hatred of my body but rather feeling a shift in myself that sometimes comes from who I\'m around. It\'s like, I get reminded of how much I really am different from the people I\'m around.\n\nI could be in the girliest outfit possible, but I see an AFAB girl in a similar outfit and I\'m reminded just how stupid I must seem. Alternatively, I could be dressed in the most typical guy fashion, but spend time around guys and be reminded of how much I don\'t identify or agree with the way that ""guys are"" (I can catch myself thinking ""guys are stupid"" or stuff like that and feel like I\'m speaking about guys as a separate group from myself).\n\nHopefully this makes sense...if you have any questions or suggestions or just want to spout off saying that this makes no sense whatsoever, please do.', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'My current headspace in relation to gender identity [may be slightly nSFW]', 'created': 1468109979.0}"

2016-07-19 10:20:09,4tkfp8,4,4,"Hey, I'm a 16 year old female and I'm not sure what I am. 
I've had an identity crisis since I can remember and I'm getting sick of it. 
It really began when I was 6, I was in love with my best friend who was a girl. I didn't really think about it, I just knew I wanted to be with her forever. Later I learned about being gay, and I quickly accepted I was a lesbian. 
My memory from when I was younger is very bad, I think it's because I was very depressed most of the time. I remember my family always told me to smile once, because I never did. I don't exactly know why I was always sad, I just saw no joy in life. 
When I was between 8 and 12 I always enjoyed playing with boys more than girls. I cut my hair short because I wanted to be one of them, but while my hair was short I also hung out with girls who told me my short hair was weird. So I decided to let it grow long again. 
When I was 12 I also fell in love with another female friend, I tried to let het know with small hints but I don't she ever got it. 
Around that time I also learned about transgenders, and I wondered if I was a transgender too. 
I also noticed boys got interested in me, I was a girl who was addicted to minecraft like most boys that time. I made a lot of friends because of that, but most of those friendships got ruined when they started telling me they were in love with me. I was not even thinking about a relationship with a boy, so they stopped hanging out with me. 
I've always struggled with social anxiety, and that anxiety got very bad when I was 14. I had a huge fight with a friend of mine, she thought I was flirting with her crush because I was hanging out with him a lot. But all I wanted was a male friend. She was the most populair girl in my friend circle, so I couldnt hang out with most of my friends anymore.
I think anxiety is the reason I stopped hanging out with boys. I was scared people thought I was weird.
A few friends stayed with me after the fight. One of them was a guy who people said had a crush on me. We were both very shy, I think I was in love with him but I never told him. That was when I got confused if I really was a lesbian. I never told anyone that I was a lesbian btw, I just never talked about love stuff with my friends. 
I think I was 14 when I told people in my class I was lesbian, I never told my parents because we don't have a close relationship and I feel like it would be awkward. 
I never got problems for being lesbian because in my country being gay isn't a very big deal. I just felt very unconfortable knowing my female friends knew I'm gay. I've always been a bit awkward because of my anxiety, so I was scared my best friend would think I was in love with her.  So I later told them I wasn't lesbian after all. 
I was struggling very hard at that time with who I was, in online games I started telling people I was a guy, but later made a new account telling I was a girl. When I was a girl I wanted to be a guy and when I was a guy I wanted to be a girl. One day I will look in the mirror hating my breasts and the next day I will look in the mirror wishing they were bigger.  
When I was 15 I cut my hair really short, thinking it'd make me happier but it didn't. All I wanted was for it to grow long again. I missed the attention I got from guys.
Last year I got into a new class without any of my old friends. And since I'm very bad at making friends I sat alone most of the time. I made 1 new female friend, but we didn't hang out much. I also made a male friend, but he got depressed and didn't want to talk with me about it so we stopped talking.
Being my most lonely year, it was also my happiest year, I finally got out of my depression, and I started to love life. I feel like one of the luckiest people on earth and my dream is to share my luck with others. My anxiety is still as bad though.
I also feel like I'm falling back into my depression becausr I became scared of beigg alone and sleeping because I hate my thoughts right now.
I still hang out with my old friends sometimes, and we go to parties together but I keep feeling I don't belong with them and that they invite me because they feel bad for me. 
Recently I learned my anxiety is a lot less after drinking alcohol, so I can't wait for the parties I'll have this summer. 
My one wish is to find a male friend to talk with about girls &amp; stuff. That's what I always wanted. And maybe I'll find out if I'm trans or genderfluid or just lesbian.

So I decided to let it grow long again. \nWhen I was 12 I also fell in love with another female friend, I tried to let het know with small hints but I don't she ever got it. \nAround that time I also learned about transgenders, and I wondered if I was a transgender too. \nI also noticed boys got interested in me, I was a girl who was addicted to minecraft like most boys that time. I made a lot of friends because of that, but most of those friendships got ruined when they started telling me they were in love with me. I was not even thinking about a relationship with a boy, so they stopped hanging out with me. \nI've always struggled with social anxiety, and that anxiety got very bad when I was 14. I had a huge fight with a friend of mine, she thought I was flirting with her crush because I was hanging out with him a lot. But all I wanted was a male friend. She was the most populair girl in my friend circle, so I couldnt hang out with most of my friends anymore.\nI think anxiety is the reason I stopped hanging out with boys. I was scared people thought I was weird.\nA few friends stayed with me after the fight. One of them was a guy who people said had a crush on me. We were both very shy, I think I was in love with him but I never told him. That was when I got confused if I really was a lesbian. I never told anyone that I was a lesbian btw, I just never talked about love stuff with my friends. \nI think I was 14 when I told people in my class I was lesbian, I never told my parents because we don't have a close relationship and I feel like it would be awkward. \nI never got problems for being lesbian because in my country being gay isn't a very big deal. I just felt very unconfortable knowing my female friends knew I'm gay. I've always been a bit awkward because of my anxiety, so I was scared my best friend would think I was in love with her.  So I later told them I wasn't lesbian after all. \nI was struggling very hard at that time with who I was, in online games I started telling people I was a guy, but later made a new account telling I was a girl. When I was a girl I wanted to be a guy and when I was a guy I wanted to be a girl. One day I will look in the mirror hating my breasts and the next day I will look in the mirror wishing they were bigger.  \nWhen I was 15 I cut my hair really short, thinking it'd make me happier but it didn't. All I wanted was for it to grow long again. I missed the attention I got from guys.\nLast year I got into a new class without any of my old friends. And since I'm very bad at making friends I sat alone most of the time. I made 1 new female friend, but we didn't hang out much. I also made a male friend, but he got depressed and didn't want to talk with me about it so we stopped talking.\nBeing my most lonely year, it was also my happiest year, I finally got out of my depression, and I started to love life. I feel like one of the luckiest people on earth and my dream is to share my luck with others. My anxiety is still as bad though.\nI also feel like I'm falling back into my depression becausr I became scared of beigg alone and sleeping because I hate my thoughts right now.\nI still hang out with my old friends sometimes, and we go to parties together but I keep feeling I don't belong with them and that they invite me because they feel bad for me. \nRecently I learned my anxiety is a lot less after drinking alcohol, so I can't wait for the parties I'll have this summer. \nMy one wish is to find a male friend to talk with about girls &amp; stuff. That's what I always wanted. And maybe I'll find out if I'm trans or genderfluid or just lesbian. \n\nI'm sorry if this story is too unrelated I just don't know where to put this I don't have anyone to talk about this.

2016-07-19 14:51:39,4tliae,4,3,"Hey everyone ! It's been a while since I've first sensed I was not completely a girl. I've always thought it was because I was a bit masculin-er than other girls. Some times ago, I even thought I might be a trans-man. So I finally looked into the net to help me with all those disphoria I've been having. And I finally discovered this reddit who helped a lot.

Now, I'm searching for some idea to perfect my ""guy look"". I have long hair that I don't wish to cut for now (don't know why). I think that I have a face close to one of an androgyne, but I think my eyes are too big to be masculine. And the worse : I have natural curves which I don't really like (sorry for the AMAB out there, I'll gladly donate them if I could). I have large shoulders but rather normal waist and large hip/butt/thighs for a guy.

So here are my questions :
- Is there some FAAB or AMAB here with long hair, and what do you do with them on guy day ?
- I don't use any make-up, but do you think I can use some to shrink my eyes maybe ?
- For FAAB with curves, what do you wear without looking like a rapper of '90 to hide those curves ?

2016-07-22 12:56:55,4u2m9i,3,6,"I have no idea who I am. It all started some years back when I fell into a deep depression, which I'll talk about later.

A little about me: 

I am a 21 year old male. After the past few months, I am pretty sure I am gender fluid, or some form thereof.

When I was a kid, I always felt different from other guys. I was always more feminine than they were. I considered myself girly. I never thought I was a girl, I just thought that I wasn't male. I always played with dolls and liked girly stuff. For a long time, I never connected with my gender. I didn't want to be a boy or think I was a boy, I just didn't quite fit in. So I didn't identify as being a guy. I always thought my being sensitive, small, and not liking sports made me not worthy of calling myself a guy. 
When I got to college, I sorta started identifying as a girl. I started realizing that I couldnt develop my own sense of masculinity.

I entered a depression last semester. To summarize, a girl I liked said some really awful things to me and told me that a real man doesn't wear nice clothes or act gentlemanly to everyone or cook (all things that I do/like to do). Combined with other circumstances in my life, I feel into a depression. After that, I started questioning my sexual and gender identities.

I like women's fashion. I take an interest in what women wear, and like it when I see a well-dressed women. I also think men should have more variety in their wardrobe. To me, women have more variety.

For the past few months I've been wondering if I'm trans. And I have no idea. I have never felt uncomfortable having a penis, nor have I ever wanted breasts or a vagina. On the contrary, I liked going into puberty and seeing more body hair and a deeper voice. I went to an all guys school, and I never felt uncomfortable being there. But I've been hung up on the idea that maybe I am trans.
I have a sexual fetish for women's and men's clothes. Not for everything, mostly women's hosiery, heels, and men's shoes.

I don't mind having a penis, nor do I mind having facial or body hair. Actually, I quite like having facial and body hair.

I don't mind it when people see me as a man. I have thought about cross-dressing for sexual pleasure and because I want to look sexy.

I have a bit of an odd relationship with my appearance. I like how I look (sometimes). But I always picture myself looking different. I always picture myself as a different, better-looking man. But then I look and I'm not.

I identify with some women, and I naturally get alone better with them and prefer their company. Additionally, when I'm around women I feel most like a man.

Some other facts, I've freaked out and had breakdowns about other things. I had a period where I was afraid I was gay. My sister said I had homosexual OCD (HOCD). I once had an irrational and paranoid fear that I was going insane, when I was really just depressed. That being said, I wonder if my fear about being trans is just another one of those irrational fears I have.

I'm really skinny, and I've had issues finding clothes that fit me like I would like. I am also extremely self conscious. As a result, there isn't much variety in my wardrobe. I fear that this combined with my interest in women's fashion makes me trans.

I have some ""feminine"" characteristics. I'm submissive, eager to please, I'm emotionally sensitive, and I like serving people.
I've always identified as being more feminine, but I've always known logically I was a boy.

I've also seen myself as more masculine sometimes, as well.

Last but not least, I've always been curious as to what it's like to be a woman.

With all of that being said, what do you think I am? Am I trans and in denial? Or am I just a cis guy who doesn't fit? Or am I something else?

One of my earlierst memories was when I was in my first year of primary school and we were learning about wishes and the teacher asked everyone what they wished for... and I remember wishing to be a girl, and of course everyone laughed and I was embarassed but I never brought this up to anyone for a while. I also remember that my younger sister used to play with baby dolls and there were times when I wanted to play with them too, when I was maybe 7/8 and although my parents told me that I could do whatever I want (thankfully they're pretty supportive of whatever I do) I remember specifically not playing with them because something just felt wrong, or bad, by doing so.

As my breasts get more pronounced, and I am gaining even more hip mass, I'm getting pissed off!

I didn't want to jiggle today, damn you. Obey me! Literally an impossible request.

 I kindof need to vent/have someone who can relate? I've always had problems with my physical shape. Body dysmorphia, I was a very skinny child with no real alliance towards a sexual preference for the most part, and didn't really want to deal with puberty. I knew it was coming, and yet I was not happy about it. Let me be a 'person'.

It happened. I was pissed (lol, it's what the born female body does a good deal of the time...and yet I hated it). And every time the egg drops, I get pissed. It's not even that I want male genitalia. I think it'd be awesome, I'd love to experience that, but all the time? No. I want a choice.

Maybe pegged as 'person' first. Hot girl...when I feel like it.

I write roleplaying stories with people in scifi or fantasy situations. Not like 'der i hit u with a stick' more like '6k words later and we have a small novel'. Why? Because I want to be every goddamn variation of person. I don't want it static! It's maddening.

I know if I transitioned it's not the right fit, but I know staying where I am is not the right fit...either?

This makes it all-together so very confusing.

Pansexual and possibly gender-fluid. I never thought the latter was actually a 'thing' in my life. And yet it's a daily thing and I'm stupid for not really considering it.

 Today, I was feeling very 'dude'. Problem is, I'm extremely feminine looking. Like cute Christina Hendricks if the body was a bit more curvy. Like no. I don't want to do that today.

I have no interest in breast binding. I just don't want them to show up when I don't want them there. I also don't want to pretend to have a package. That's not how I want to be.

I've felt this way forever, but alas, I am a girl with dat hips and dat ass and dat cute girly face...what the shit can a girly girl do when she wants to, idk, present as male or even ????? sometimes?!

I don't even know how this shit works..My stomach fat is making me angry, my boobs are making me angry. 

When it comes to sexy times, I enjoy playing any and all roles and genders. The fact that I cannot fully be the role I want to at the given moment makes me livid...

The world was not made for people like me, it appears.

I am so confused, and so pissed off...

I had put on maroon skirt, feminine shoes, fem t-shirt, some makeup including purple eyeliner and mascara.  showing leg from foot to mid thigh, which I have worked so hard to make look feminine.  all in all, definitely exuding female compared to 'normal' in the eyes of people who have known me before two months ago when I decided to start being myself, and coming out.

""i'm on my way over to work on the shed"".  ok, crap.  i live in a non-friendly state to LGBTQ, so i'm terrified.  my area seems pretty friendly, though.  but will my landlord treat me poorly if he finds out?  there's no protection for me except the lease.  but he's on the way over to work on the outbuilding.  ok, panic.  should i real quick change back, take off the makeup, pretend i'm a boy today?  

no, i'm so tired of pretending.  so ready to be myself.  i'm dressed, feeling good about the way i look, about the way i feel, about how the way i look more closely matches the way i feel.  heck, i was going to go out and talk to a bunch of strangers anyway when i run errands, so i decide to simply meet him as i am. 

i answer the door.  no visible reaction from landlord.  no visible reaction from the nephew there to help with the shed.

basic greeting, then:

me: ""well, you outed me, or at least i'm outed.  hi, i'm ____, and i'm gender fluid.  today, i'm feeling pretty much a girl.""

him: ""there's a million ways to love and live"".

me: ""wow, thanks!""
