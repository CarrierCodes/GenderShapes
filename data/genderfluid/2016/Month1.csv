I'm currently dating someone (we've been dating for eons) who has been questioning their gender since we met. I consider myself fairly well versed in gender stuff, but obviously that can only help to an extent, since each person is different. Anywho, to the point, my partner was dmab, and is not out to their family/a good portion of their friends. I find myself lapsing into using male pronouns constantly, and struggling when they're in a feminine headspace. Part of this is because for a long time, I had no idea that they were genderfluid.

My big problem with dating women has always been that while I am terribly attracted to them, a good majority of them have vaginas, which I have, and as someone who quite enjoys being penetrated, a dildo just doesn't bring me the same kind of pleasure &amp; closeness as having my partner inside of me.

I love this person with all of my heart, and the thought of them being in a body that makes them feel dysphoric literally keeps me up at night.

2016-01-13 18:59:39,40thso,6,23,"My girlfriend of 5 years, whom I was engaged to be married to, recently broke off our engagement. I suffer from depression, and while it's definitely exhausting for me to deal with, it's also certainly been exhausting for my partner to deal with as well. She said she felt like she was living more for me and not enough for her, and she simply couldn't handle it anymore.

The other big reason for our break up was my genderfluidity. We'd been together for 5 years and she's known about my gender identity for 3 of those years. At first she wasn't sure what to make of my crossdressing, but she figured that clothes are just clothes and it was nothing else. The more I began to explore my gender, the more uneasiness she felt but she still tried to be supportive and open minded. I always tried to make her feel comfortable while also asserting my own identity, and though I assured her again and again that I wasn't going to transition (because I honestly don't think it would resolve anything for me), I've always sensed that her unease never really left. She did well enough to refer to me with female pronouns and the name I've chosen for when I am in girlmode, most of the time (usually when we were with others that also knew about my genderfluidity) but even getting her to do that was met with some difficulty and adjustment. Recently I thought we had come to a place of understanding, enough that I could truly be myself with someone who really loves me for who I am. I was wrong.

When she ended things, she told me she couldn't reconcile the thought of me being a woman (even part time) when she knew me as the man I was born as. Though I told her that many of the innate qualities she loved in me as a person came from my female side, she said that she simply cannot love me as a woman. Something about it just doesn't compute with her/makes her uncomfortable. She tried, she really did, really hard, but she can't anymore. It's not just the dysphoria, which really ties into my depression, but the very notion of me being both male and female. She said that not knowing who she was coming home to and how to treat me gave her tremendous anxiety. I tried to see if we could compromise, if I could be less polarizing (as well as promising to start seeing a therapist again, which is what I was planning on doing anyway before this all happened), but she wouldn't have it. She said she couldn't.

I feel awful, heartbroken, and utterly alone. I never saw this relationship as the end-all/be-all to my problems but it was my constant, my harbor, and so long as I had this, I could weather the storm and deal with the depression and any negative aspects of my genderfluidity, like dysphoria, but now I don't have that. Now, when I'm a girl, I don't feel joyful or free or beautiful. At best, I feel nothing like I used to when I'd express my femme self. At worst, I feel guilty, ashamed, and just all around awful. Though I am glad that I have embraced my genderfluidity and I'm open to alot of people, I now often wish I hadn't told her or anyone. This has felt like it's brought me more grief than joy. I know how self-destructive that line of thinking can be, but I can't help feeling this way, anymore than I can help being the way I am.

I just had to vent somewhere. Being in a supportive relationship, with a seemingly supportive partner, I never thought I would lose the person I love the most because of wanting to be myself and sharing that.

The best place to get to know my is probably on my tumblr (pinstripes-and-roses.tumblr.com), but for anyone who is curious, here's me:

I'm 38 years old. I've always known that something was different about me. Pre- and early into puberty I thought I might be gay, because I secretly liked a lot of traditionally girly things. I wanted to dress like a girl. I never opened up to my family or anyone else about any of it. And of course, I never acted on it. I was bullied and picked on enough as it was for being tall, skinny, nerdy, and un-athletic. I also had a lot of body issues growing up, which I blamed on not liking how skinny I was at the time. 

Once I started dating girls, and realized that I was exclusively sexually attracted to women, I was able to rule out being gay. But I still felt off.

Finally, as trans awareness bloomed, so did I. Wow, that sounds so lame, but I am going to leave it rather than fuss over words. It took me a long time to open up about it, but I think I've had a better idea of who I am in my mind for a few years now. 

I've been happily married for over ten years, and my wife and I have one child. I came out as genderfluid to my wife earlier this week. She has been supportive, and I am so thankful for that. She's had questions and concerns, but she has been so loving and helpful. It's more than I could have imagined.

I'm still trying to figure out the best label for me to use (more for others than for me, I'm not big on them personally), but so far the best one I can find is demiguy. No matter where on the gender spectrum I am, I still feel anchored to being male. Much of the time, I feel 100% male. And often I float over to androgyny, and femme. While I look forward to crossdressing, I can't see myself presenting as female often. Mostly I just want to add some androgyny to my style, maybe rock a maxi skirt or some cute tops. Something silky for the bedroom, perhaps.

I haven't come out to friends (yet) or family, so I don't post selfies or use my real name.

Names are funny things.

In the past people’s names changed: they changed with their jobs and forefathers jobs, giving us names like Cooper, Fletcher and Smith; they changed for their parents, giving us names like Harrison, Johnson and Peterson; they changed with where we lived, giving us names like Essex, York and Saxe-Cobourg. Some places still change names like that, Iceland for one.The changing of names is a slow one. Every so often you encounter individuals where the changing of names happens much faster, sometimes you find an individual whom has deliberately stopped the changing of a name for one reason or another.

But these are changes to surnames and the changes we’re talking about with these names is cross generational, parents and children having different surnames. A closer look at the word tells its tale a little bit more: sur, the French for below or under, a sub name to tell you apart from every tom, dick and harry with the same name as you.  

Most people only have one name, this name can have any number of different bits, from something simple like John Smith, to something complex like Eleanor Elizabeth Rebecca Fitzwilliam-Smythe. It is one name referring to one individual over the period of a lifetime. Nicknames are a popular way of changing a name, but they tend to be temporary and situational, and people tend not to think of themselves as their nickname.

I’m Anna, and I have two names. Anna isn’t the name I was given by my parents, but it’s part of me now. I’m not always Anna, but that’s something for later, first I’ll talk about how I came to be Anna and how i got where i am now.

I had a single name a while ago, but slowly I came to realise: this name wasn’t right for me all the time, the feeling of not rightness grew and blossomed and became a feeling of wrongness, my single name became wrong for me some of the time. For a long time I worked on trying to tweak my given name, but it never quite felt right and we had someone else in our family with a very similar name to mine, in the end I decided I wanted a clean break from the family of names surrounding my given name. After playing with my given name I looked at Selene, I was a fan of Greek mythology and space, the name of the Greek goddess for the Moon seemed like a nice choice; but eventually I moved away from it, it was too awkward on the tongue and a pain to set down in writing, the final nail in the coffin was the realisation that actually I wasn’t elegant enough to pull off a name like Selene. Finally I stumbled on a name in a book I was reading, it struck a chord with me and I did some digging into the name, the different forms, the history and the meaning of it, and I knew who I was.

In finding my new name I had finished a process which had started when I was about 12, the first step in a journey which took on a new significance and new personal speed when I was 15. I was roughly 15 when I talked to my parents and a GP about this journey for the first time, I was met with disapproval and disbelief by all three of them, and the GP told me I was too young to be able to know about it. Horrified by what was happening, to what I wanted to be a nice simple discussion, I ran from my journey and buried as much of it as deep as I could for a long time; having changed nothing about what was happening to me. It wasn’t until I was 18 and in Upper Sixth that I began to re-open what I had buried and I began re-examining this journey thoroughly, this was when I returned to my name for the first time in nearly 4 years. The journey sped up when I got to university, but not at first. In my first year I was shy and spent most of the year building my confidence. I debated joining a society meant to advocate for people like me but wrestling past their hedonism to find the activism was an Odyssey in its own right, so I decided to stay away; I also encountered a society of fantasists and dreamers and fell in with them as a true geek. In my second year I considered the support society again but Bacchus still danced among them, I became more involved with the fantasists and made many friendships that survive to this day. I also met a spiny leaf in a famous sort of Suinae field, a saint in variegated armour who showed me a way forwards, something I’d not been aware of; a path my journey could travel down more smoothly. In my third year and beyond the relationships I had built grew stronger, some were tested and survived, and the confidence and advice imparted to me by the cultivar crested champion saw me through many hard and dark times.

I’m Anna, and I have two names. Anna isn’t the name I was given by my parents, But it’s part of me now. I’m not always Anna and now you know how that happened and how i got here, i think it’s late enough now.
