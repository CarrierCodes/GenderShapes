2016-02-03 06:56:04,43ypdd,2,5,"Hi everyone,

I am a trans guy and am currently writing my undergrad thesis in psychology at York University in Toronto, Canada. I think it's important for research about the trans/non-cisgender community to be done by trans people so I chose the focus of my thesis to be on the resiliencies of trans and genderqueer folks. I want to make sure I include the full spectrum of non-cisgender identities in my research which is why I am posting this study here. Psychology sometimes still has a long way to go in including non-cisgender individuals in research and care so I'm hoping my small study can help things along. 

I would be happy to answer any additional questions here, or the first page of the study gives my supervisor's contact info.

The recruitment text is below:

2016-02-15 13:40:44,45whz3,0,2,"Hi there! I'm an Asian teen, under 20 years old. I've recently moved to Sydney for university. I'm not too sure what else to say about myself, but I'm going to be holding on to this account for a while, and I can just post if I have anything else to say. So I'll just get to the nitty gritty.

ABOUT ME - Mentally

If I'm not wrong, I'm gender dysphoric. I have a fascination for female clothing, sometimes dream of being a girl and not a guy and have tried on heels, which was a long time ago since I've since grown out of my mother's high heels. I've had no wish to change genders, was raised as a boy and identify as a boy. I feel fine as I am.

I'm really afraid to say that I'm only doing this for sexual pleasure because it started off as such, though I can't really remember how it started. I just sort of want it to be something more than that. Masturbation is something that doesn't appeal to me because it just feels wrong, but it's become something of a habit since I discovered it. 

Anyways, recently I found out about androgyny, and I was really motivated by it. (I have a few close friends who I'm afraid might freak out and distance themselves should I come out publicly, only certain close people know about this). I am really into the idea of having someone having to put thought into determining my gender. It also means that I can pass off my antics as being overly stylish. :P

TL;DR, my dream is crossdressing and passing, current goal is 'androgyning' and passing.

ABOUT ME - Physically

I'm rather proud of my slim frame, though it's kind of bony though less so than a while back. It's also rectangular, widening at the shoulder. Height is about average for an Asian teen, 5'10'. I'd like to think that my face looks like something that can be easily made to look like one gender or the other, but that's my judgement and my opinion isn't the opinion of everyone else. It's rather round with a sort of wide jawline, which became inspiration for my username. Trying to grow out my hair, which could make my about-three-head-width shoulders look less. At this point I can only dream of a pixie cut.

I have used hair remover on my legs, which works rather well but never keeps it at bay. Epilation is said to hurt as is waxing, so that option is pretty daunting, not to mention expensive. I'd really not like to spend too much on pampering myself as I brave through uni.

did I mention I hate beard hairs and five o clock shadow ugh 

QUESTIONS

What sounds androgynous? I'd like to train my voice to speak in that manner or maybe even feminine, but I have nothing to relate to. Everything just sounds so high. I'd like some references and tips on how to train my voice, whatever you might know - I've done a bit of research.

Hair removal? What do you (faab&amp;amp;maab) do with your hair, every patch of it?

Some natural method of widening my hips. Exercises, anything.

Clothing styles. Korean fashion and the like is very, very appealing. 

...that's about all I can conjure up. I might put photos on the web but I'm wary of privacy and all.

I realize this is a lot to take in, and this is all for myself. If you're willing to help out, I thank you very, very much in advance.

See you in the comment section!

I don't really consider myself to be genderfluid, but I have had some times in the past where I wasn't really sure.

2016-02-23 13:41:00,476m8p,11,9,"Hello fellow fluid people :)

I'm a 25 AMAB genderfluid person. (Also I'm still trying to get the hang of how to layout posts at reddit, so bare with me)

&amp;nbsp;

For me girl-mode always slowly creeps in on me. Sometimes just because I feel like it, other times when I'n triggered because of something (like for example being at the clothing store, unable to browse the women section).   Then I feel this nagging itch of putting on some girl clothing, if I feel like it works that day (and look like a girl) the gendereuphoria kicks in up to a point that I sometimes think I might better off being a girl. But when the euphoria wears off I immediately revert back to guy-mode.  Like when you thought you were in love with someone, and right after this other person confirms their love for you, you then you start to feel like 'Oh shit, perhaps I'm not really in love after all'. At the end of my cycle (returning back to guy-mode) I feel the same embarrassment. Like 'What the hell was I doing!?"". Still I don't want throw away my girl clothing, I still do not feel fully a like a full 'male'. I still feel fluid. And it confuses the hell out of me. 

&amp;nbsp;

*So basicly my cycle is:* 1.Guy-ish mode  2.(Trigger) 3.Nagging for girly things -&gt; crossdressing 4.Gendereuphoria (like a lovesick puppy) 5.Could it be that I am actually a girl? 6.Noping the fuck out of it feeling embarrassed and all. 

&amp;nbsp;

However even though how unsettling this is, it always worked out since I was the only one knowing it. But in a rush of being in girl-mode for a few days, I came out to my mother and a close friend of mine. My friend (a girl) stayed really cool about it. My mum too, but being the worried type she is, she was like 'If this feeling persist you might wanna see therapist' and 'Couldn't it be you're just transgendered (as referring to the media term).' And for two days after coming out I started to warm up to that idea as wel. But now BOOM out of nowhere, back to boy mode. Sorry mum, I guess I was wrong? 

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR: Weird gendercycle, feeling awkward when back to 'boy-mode'. Mum thinks I might be trans.

&amp;nbsp;

edit: I have no idea how to make bulletpoints...

edit 2:
Also might be worth telling that when I feel more like a girl I like to browse the /asktransgender reddit a lot.
