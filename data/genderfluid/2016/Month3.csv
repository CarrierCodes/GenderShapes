2016-03-02 19:32:10,48nsji,12,8,"Hey everyone. I bet you get this question a lot: ""Am I genderfluid?""

23M here. I've been crossdressing (or at least interested) about as long as I can remember. The earliest I remember doing it is when I was 11. I've always had strong binge/purge cycles related to guilt post-dressing, but I understand this is common because society is dumb. It's been getting better now that I've semi-accepted that part of myself.

Recently I've been having meltdowns where I can't look at myself in the mirror any more and cry about my body. I wish I had hips instead of a strong jawline; a natural hourglass (I can fake it with a corset) instead of an Adam's apple.

These feelings come in waves, thus wondering if 'genderfluid' describes me better than M2F trans. When I ask myself ""am I a woman?"" the answer is no. It's more like I want to have a female physique. I've never been content with a male physique (like, I know when I look good by society's standards, but I feel no joy when I do dress up manly). I believe what I'm experiencing is Body Dismorphia as opposed to Gender Dysphoria. Is this correct?

Thanks for reading. I appreciate having a place where I can ask these questions...",genderfluid,Am I genderfluid? Or trans?

I feel as though I'm isolated in my feelings of dysmorphia, and feel like I'm not able/willing to feel so vulnerable and open to public ridicule.

That\'s about as far as I\'m willing to go. I\'m considering a short haircut, but my hair is already a little short and I miss it being longer. I know a wig would \'help,\' but it wouldn\'t be enough. \n\nIt\'s just too frustrating that I can\'t shapeshift, basically, is what I\'m getting at.

2016-03-23 03:45:52,4bkz8s,11,1,"So, I wrote a small thing on an askreddit question, and it blew up. this is basically what I described myself as gender wise on the question:


Its strange hearing about those who are gender fluid who freak out over the issue. For me, my sex is female. I am a woman. however, my soul is neither gender. I dream of being male and female, and have no issue with either body. I don't even realize theres a difference. I was given a body to move around in, socialize with, that protects me and helps me out on this earth. And thats pretty nifty. So, I suppose I feel like neither gender (I don't really feel like I have a gender) but my sex doesn't bother me. I have boobs, thats kinda cool. and hey, vaginas are lovely. so are penises. no big deal which one I'm given. It just is what I was put in. no biggy. I don't see the big issue about being in a body when you feel like neither gender.
I can empathize, despite that, because thats my personal take on it and others react very differently and have very different circumstances. its tough to view your body as not a part of who you are that shows the real you.
(I am talking about gender fluid as in feeling like neither gender here. the scale is WAY bigger then that, so I respect and hope all beings regardless of circumstance find happiness within themselves and the body they were given.)

Edit: I am talking about being in an ""alien"" body in the sense that, yes I have a human body and its female, but my soul is not really either gender.
On a more ""crazy"" side of it, I don't feel particularly human inside my body. (This is different then the gender thing, my apologies) I mean, I am a human because I am in a human body, and thats totally fine. But as a soul, I don't particularly feel like I could only be a human and thats it. If I am given another life I would be fine being a tree (ok I might get bored, I don't know) or a bird or something. But I want to know: is that just my religious view point, or a part of how I identify myself as a soul in a human body? So I am never quite sure if its normal for people to feel only human or just a soul who happened to be placed into a human body for this lifetime. thoughts? ideas? This is weird I know. Do most people feel their soul is human?


So, with this..am I actually gender fluid? I would be fine in a male or female body, and I don't particularly feel like I have a gender, which is why I wouldn't mind at all to being a different sex. I enjoy being a female though, and hardly ever even think about my ""gender"". I don't have body dysmorphia, I feel like I am a woman and can do woman things and enjoy woman activities, but soul wise I really am not any gender at all. The idea that people believe their souls to be gendered blew my mind. It was so normal for me to think that we were genderless souls put inside gendered bodies (especially with the fact that I am not oppressed in any way, no one hurts me or even really knows, and its so ""whatever"" to me that I hardly notice it myself) that it just blew me away to think that people felt differently.

Am I just a normal cisgender person? or am I gender fluid?

Unfortunately, my family doesn't always follow all of the love and acceptance parts, instead using religion as a justification for intolerance.

This lead to a lot of confusion for me growing up. It was made very clear early on that non-gender-conforming behavior wouldn't be tolerated. As a kid, this lead to a lot of inner turmoil as I struggled with my gender identity and its occasional conflicts with my anatomy. At the time, I didn't clearly understand the source of my discontent; growing up in such a sheltered environment, I didn't have *any* exposure to non-cis non-straight friends or role models. I didn't have the vocabulary to compose the thought of my gender not matching my sex. Indeed, it was a given that those two terms meant the same thing.

Lacking a context to frame these thoughts and feelings, I came to the conclusion that they meant that I was broken, or sinful. I would ""punish"" myself for these bad feelings, either mentally berating myself or sometimes engaging in self-harm. When adolescence arrived, things got even more frustrating as I didn't develop the interest in girls that my peers did. I didn't feel any attraction to men either, but not being attracted to women in my mind meant that I might be gay, more fuel for the broken/sinful fire.

During this time, my family had (and still has) no idea that any of this was going on with me. I completely internalized and hid all of it from them and everyone else. They're still nice people and I still love them, but explaining to them that I'm gender fluid (a term I discovered around age 30 that seems to fit me well enough) wasn't likely to be well received. As in, it's highly likely that all communication with them would be cut off, I wouldn't be allowed to see my nieces and nephews anymore etc. That's not something I'm willing to risk.

Around the time of my 30th birthday, things hit a low. I lost my job. I had been struggling a *lot* with dysphoria and self-harming. By this time I'd been exposed to a much broader world in terms of sex, gender and sexual identity, but I was still locked in the binary mindset of cis vs trans and straight vs gay.

Eventually I broke down and decided to explore the portion of my gender that isn't strictly in line with my sex. It was a slow, painful process filled with shame and self-loathing. I felt like I was giving in to sin, that what I was doing was wrong, but at the same time it was eye-opening and freeing in a way that's difficult to describe. Realizing that there's a term for the feelings I'd had my entire life was a revelation.

Lost amidst all of this confusion, I decided to confide in my closest friend about what I was going through. She was very understanding and supportive, and we would regularly meet up to talk about things in confidence. She helped me with ideas for how I could express some of my feminine feelings, helped me purchase a few items of clothing/makeup etc. Mostly just having someone to talk to about things was a huge relief. It took its tole on the friendship though. In the last year we've hung out less and less. She doesn't respond to texts and I can't seem to get on her calendar. At the beginning of 2016 she basically said she doesn't have time to be friends with me anymore. In the space of 3 years, the one person I told my secret to, the one person most likely to accept who I am in all it's non-conformity, and it basically ended our friendship. I feel like I'm a little kid again, hating myself for what I am and the distance it puts between me and the people I care about.

I'm not looking for a pity party, and I'm not looking for someone to fix all my problems for me. I have no intention of harming myself or anyone else.
