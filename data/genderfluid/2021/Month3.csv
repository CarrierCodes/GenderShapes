2021-03-09 19:49:51,m1elpm,12,1,"Hello! 

I am a novice author and wanted to include a genderfluid protagonist. As an asexual I know it sucks to have little to no representation, so I wanted to have some in my story. However I wanted to make sure this idea was not offensive to genderfluid people.

The story is set in a fantasy world, and the genderfluid protagonist is the ""daughter"" of a high ranking dark elf noble. The dark elves live in a strict matriarchy and the divine patron of the dark elves, the spider demon, demands that only females can have places in nobility. These are, well, some of the many villains. 

My idea was that the ""daughter"" had a ""curse"": every 3 days at midnight she would change gender. Now, in a strict matriarchy this would be seen as a ""curse"" and would disrupt the social hierarchy, and she would think it was a curse because of the society she wad raised in. (Also the family dynamic is abusive, but they dont realize it because its all they have ever known)

This ""curse"" would be one of the main reasons they leave the dark elves to join the other protagonists, claiming they want to find a ""cure"" for their curse. However, with the love and support of the other protagonists (who don't consider their genderfluidness a curse, but rather a blessing) instead they learn to accept themselves for who they are, and realized the real curse was the internalized fears and insecurities they had the whole time. 

TLDR: is it offensive to have a genderlfuid protagonist initially starts off thinking their genderfluidness is a curse, but instead realize its an amazing part of who they are and learn to accept themselves.",genderfluid,Idea for genderfluid representation in media,1615344591.0,"{'created_utc': 1615319391, 'id': 'm1elpm', 'num_comments': 12, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Hello! \n\nI am a novice author and wanted to include a genderfluid protagonist.

1) what is it feel like to be genderfluid? (I have no idea how to phrase this in any other way. Ive never so much as questioned my gender before, so sorry if this comes off as blunt)

2) how did you realize you where gender fluid?

3) how has being gender fluid affected your life?

4) what would you like to see in a genderfluid character?

5) anything else I should know?

2021-03-10 22:42:27,m2b380,8,1,"Hi, so, I originally joined this group to support my lovely genderfluid partner - learning to wrap my mind around and accept the person they are has been a wonderful, challenging, beautiful journey that has redefined my conception of what gender is -- and now I have More Questions than ever, and I need help, because my therapist likes to let me puzzle things out myself but I've hit a major road block that she hasn't been able to help me with, SO

Seeing as you've all either been on this journey before or are currently going through it, I figured this was the best forum for posting these questions. I'm really trying to approach this as academically as possible, because I seem to learn best that way, so here's where I'm at:

I know for sure a few things -- gender is not at all related to your genitals, it's in your brain. It's a spectrum, not a binary. How people define it and think of it is unique and personal. I also know that Most of our society's current conception of gender operates on a binary, and that's the reason the divide seems so definite - it's socialized, so if you never feel the need to question it you probably won't think about it much.

That's about where I was before - I'm AFAB and I was pretty much always fine with that, as far as I was aware. But when my partner realized he was genderfluid and started learning about it, I was learning along with him - and when I learned about the fact that gender is supposed to be what gives you euphoria, and not just what DOESN'T make you feel dysphoric, it felt like, as I know is a common metaphor, the cracking of an egg.

After that, I realized that there were times when I was younger where, for example, I would want to hang out with a group of guys and be ""one of the guys,"" but I wasn't able to, because I started developing around 11, and after that I could never be in a group of guy friends where at least one of them wasn't actively trying to flirt with me. It got to the point where I would be like, in my head, ""can't I just take this gender off for a while and be one of you? This is exhausting.""

I remembered that, and I thought that it was just the trauma of earlier-than-average puberty I was dealing with, but then one day I realized that there are some days where being called ""she"" makes me really happy, and others where I don't really feel any way about it, and once I noticed that I also noticed that the days where I actively like ""she"" are the days I tend to dress more feminine. THEN I realized that, although I have multiple senses of style that I like, somedays I will stand in front of my mirror, halfway through putting on an outfit, and get very overwhelmed and upset because although it's a good outfit, it doesn't ""feel right today,"" - when this happens, there isn't one answer to what DOES feel right, it's always a process of elimination, and it always ends up being an entirely different style.

This led to a further realization that I have always really sharply identified with that metaphor of the multiple personalities - not literal multiple personality disorder, rather, the version they put in kids' cartoons, where there are several slightly varied versions of the same person living in their head, like different characters. (Ex: That one Raven episode in Teen Titans, if you've seen it.) And I've seen a lot of jokes and memes online that are like, ""the gender of the day is bog witch"" or ""unknowable ghost"" or ""cottage fairy"" and I'm like, okay, so are these exaggerated jokes that to make fun of the ""attack helicopter"" crowd, or is this a Legit Thing and people describe gender with aesthetics, because if so now my question is like..........is that what gender is? 

Like, is gender a way of acting tied to your masculine/feminine/f-you-I-pick-both or I-pick neither presentation and personality, and that's it? Am I actually genderfluid too? Or am I just a writer/actor with ADHD and a lot of personalities that I developed as coping mechanisms for trauma? Or is gender truly what you make of it, and if I think that's what it is then I should call it that?

I know y'all can't actually answer these questions for me. You're not my therapists and I don't expect you to be - I just want as many varied opinions on this subject as possible, because I know in the instance of learning about gender experience is usually the best teacher.

It's hard to explain
Since I don't know what I mean
I just know that 'he' brings me pain

I'm not a girl at heart
And nor am I a 'bart'
But that's not always right
Tho now I'm neither with all my might,
Tomorrow I might wear pink,
As it can change, in just a blink

I don't always know how to do life
Sometimes being husband
Sometimes being wife
Sometimes being none
And sometimes, it's just, gone

Any will do, sir, person, or miss

It changes from agender to girl,
In just a twirl
From non-binary to boy
Like I'm a toy
My gender is fluid
And I can't. Always. Deal with it.

I've been genderfluid for a number of years, but I flow so rarely I've not done much about it. I play a lot of video games, and I kind of get my cute girly crave from making cute characters... However recently I've flowed more and more often in person. The problem is, I have a beard.

Not Viking Ragnar Lothbrook long, but an inch or two on the sides and double that on the chin. Recently I've looked at myself and disliked the beard, as I want to project a female apperance. Makeup, fairer complextion, cute, bright... However, I hate how my face looks without it as I've had it for so long. So, when I'm projecting a male look, I really want my beard.

If you’re born a girl, you don’t have to be into pink and a caretaker and this and that, a boy, you’re not required to be a fighter and a boss and all. It’s been time to leave behind perceptions of who you are supposed to be and how that fits in traditional gender definitions, and just be who you are. Because that’s awesome, and we as humans are so much more complicated than to be compartmentalized to these discrete definitions.

However, every person I’ve seen come out as non binary says they have never felt like they identified a male or female, and that’s why they’re elusive in their gender definition.

Over time my sexuality has changed a fair bit after coming to realize I'm attracted to anyone feminine or androgynous regardless of gender or genitals.

My gender identity has really gone all over the place too in the past year and I'm not quite sure what to think of myself anymore. I've always been a bit on the feminine side: I'm a textbook twink, and certain aspects of my posture and the way I sit are kinda girly, for lack of a better term.

It's kinda where my little identity crisis here comes in. Like, I really don't care about pronouns. In my mind I'm a he, but you can call me she, they, anything but late to dinner, it doesn't bother me.

He had been struggling with it for a long while (throughout his life, especially the year prior to telling me). I’m a straight, cis-gendered woman who has always dated straight, cis-gender men, so this was a bit of a shock to me. Obviously we were very emotional - him because it’s a big thing to talk about and me because I was scared of losing him. In the end, I told him that I supported him no matter what. I told him if he came out as trans that I couldn’t be his girlfriend anymore because I’m straight, but he would still have my love and support as a friend and ally. 

In the end, he decided that he wanted to still use he/him pronouns and that he wasn’t ready to use labels, but he felt genderfluid fit him pretty well. He embraces femininity, loves androgyny and wants to wear whatever clothes make him happy. As a couple, we’ve been thriving.

2021-03-17 16:03:01,m73pqc,0,1,"In February, I applied to colleges with a nonbinary marker and a new name. The motivation was that my grandma died, and it made me realize that I couldn't live my life the way I did.

I have been questioning my gender for years, almost five of them. The older I grew, the more disconnected I felt from things happening around me. I am seventeen now, and my mind just makes every single move at the age of 13 to stay frozen in a position where gender wasn't pressuring on me so hard.

Reasons I thought I was nonbinary:

\- I was periodically binding and experiencing dysphoria through the whole puberty

\- although I liked girls, I was not connected with a term lesbian

\- I liked using different pronouns than she/her but was super nervous and just wanted to try things out.

So, I live my life as a nonB person for a month now, and I am drained with the constant pressure ""WHAT IF MY PARENTS WILL KNOW"" and ""HOW WILL I FIND A  JOB I AM RUINING MY LIFE"". I am on the edge of going back to the closet forever and ever.

Reasons why I consider that:

\- It feels that I will lose the ones I love bc of it. I am from a very homophobic country. It gets more heterosexist every year,

\- If I will be open at college and accepted, I may be bullied in my country and never find a proper work

\- I may go back in evolution and be OK with living as a girl, although I will always know that I am not completely a girl and that I do not identify completely as one.

\- I feel constant stress and pressure to be exposed and I am afraid of everyone

\- I am afraid it will harm my college experiences. People will not talk to me and etc.

\- The feeling that I am not masculine enough so other people won't respect my identity

Reasons which keep me back from going to the closet:

\- my joy of being referred to as they/them.

\- my long experiences of dysphoria. I mostly have social ones and I think it will come back

\- I feel like I finally awakened from a long dream and live my life counciously, fully. I became more confident and happier

**- MAIN ONE** I am so scared of ruining my relationship with the admission staff in the college. They accepted me as a nonB person, probably wanting to improve diversity, and here I am transitioning back. Will they hate me??

I discussed same with my gf , for which she initially was worried but with enough discussion, she was OK with it. We even tried once doing things with me cross dressed. I liked it but she didn't liked it enough to try it again. I understand her perspective and I'm OK with that. \n\nBut for the past few months I'm having more thoughts of doing things with in a submissive manner cross dressed, with a man. Thoughts of getting drilled by a man. Some thoughts are also of going in public cross dressed. I have been watching a lot of shemale things and I feel like experiencing becoming a shemale.\n\nI blamed my cross dressing for such thoughts and threw all the clothing, accessories and makeup. \n\nBut the thoughts still persists."", 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'Am I straight?', 'created': 1617120226.0}"

But I can tell it'll be difficult to not use any pronouns when referring to my sibling. Can anyone give me an example on how this will work? We'll use my sibling's first initial, G, instead of G's full chosen first name, for privacy.

I guess in theory this isn't too hard, but actually coming up with sentences without pronouns that are mostly grammatically correct and don't sound forced is a little more difficult to do on the spot. I bet I'm going to slip up. Not to mention other people are going to notice and ask for an explanation as to why my sibling isn't being referred to by any pronouns, and I don't want to have to educate everyone I talk to about non-binary gender identities whenever G comes up in the conversation.

Obviously I'm going to try my best anyways to refer to G correctly, but I'm worried about being a bad older brother when I make a mistake. I don't want to out G if G isn't ready for people to know G's identity, but I also wouldn't want to misgender G. 

We have an understanding that it's fine to call me 'she' and my deadname at our grandparents house, because they're openly transphobic, but to everyone else I'm a guy (I plan to stop in-person contact with grandparents once I'm 18, or after I transition). I'm not sure who G is out to, or if it's okay not to use pronouns for G at school, because it is something my classmates would notice. I want both of us to be safe, of course, and I'm not sure if it's worth it to discuss with transphobes.

I apologize if this is not the correct subreddit to ask this.

What do you guys do about wearing t-shirts and skirts / shorts?

Today it was really hot where I live and I decided to wear shorts even though I haven‘t shaved my legs (AFAB, felt manly today) and it felt really awesome I felt euphoric.

I got some weird looks from family members who I‘m not out to so it was also kind of embarassing. But shaving would have felt weird as well. I guess they figured it must have been a personal choice or that I was too lazy.

But now it suddenly switched to the opposite. We took a walk together and took pictures and when I looked at the pictures I felt so freaking ugly. Not just the leg hair but also my posture and weight, face, hair, everything. I‘m a little overwhelmed.
