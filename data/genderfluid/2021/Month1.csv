2021-01-03 23:56:26,kpwaw4,8,1,"I'm in my early 40s now, and had an attraction to dressing and being female since I was 12/13.  My sister spending a few years away and me taking her bedroom where she left a load of clothes behind gave the opportunity for me to dress up.  I also had close female as well as male friends, and loved being accepted as one of their group without THAT getting in the way.  In my late teens I was caught dressing by my mother which was humiliating and scared me off, and as I left home the following year, there was no longer any access to fem clothes for me to try.  This was the late 90s, where attitudes and online information were both a lot more basic.  

In the meantime, I went from being a very awkward teen to being very social and outgoing, had a few girlfriends before settling with my current partner, and was pretty much the archetype cis male.  It wasn't as much that I blocked my fem side, I just didn't think about it all those years until I turned 40, by which time I was married with a kid, and had less space to be able to explore my female side.

Also in the years in-between, I had major issues with depression, saw a psychologist that diagnosed me as being on the autistic spectrum (kind of expected, but still quite heavy for me to take in), and I really detested my body (under-height, slightly overweight, and with enough body hair).  This is something that occupied me rather more than my gender.

My renewed interest was likely a mix of the increase in trans representation in the media over recent years, the abundance of information online that wasn't there when I was younger (things may have turned out very different if I knew as a teen that I wasn't completely alone), and also that my body and appearance did not need to hold me back.

2021-01-05 08:04:52,kqtrrw,4,1,"Hello there

ᴳᵉⁿᵉʳᵃˡ ᴷᵉⁿᵒᵇᶦ

So to start out I (22M) have lately been having thoughts about my gender for the pass 3-5 months. it started out small when i went to the gym again to get into shape and lately ive been really feeling the affects of my efforts. i am currently 245lbs overweight and am training 5 times out the week to hopefully reach my goal of 170lbs. But during my journey I keep feeling a switch in body goals. While originally I wanted to be that slick, lean muscle guy with a 6 pack and a ripped chest. absolute eye candy, I also wanted to be a more softer but firm looking person with a bubble butt and a hour glass shaped waist.

These thoughts have been increasing more and more towards the end of December and now im confused on my identity. Like one day I want to be that ripped man and the next day i wanna be soft and squishy. Some days I want to wear casual clothing as a guy and next I want to wear compressed pants and corsets to bring definition to ""the goods"". I wont lie and say i really want to be both ends of the spectrum but now its extended to other things where I question my sexuality.

I always have been straight and even now I still majority like women. But lately While i work on my lower half, I had thoughts of being with a big strong man with me being very submissive. Its sounds very odd to me and really I dont like those thoughts but I keep thinking about it over and over. Slowly leaning towards acceptance. But the problem I have is I cant make up my mind. Originally my goals changed too ""I want to look masculine on top while my lower half looks more  scandalous and juicy."" And really I dont know if I should continue to either bulk up and be a strong man or slim down and been basically a femboy. Wont lie I been mostly a man most of my life but now I feel like i want to venture to the other side and try new things. Ideally I want to be either that strong viking warrior looking type of man (That Jason momoa look) or that goth girl with the flat chest but a ass that is so packed you want to take a handful. Im not sure right now but till then im working on slimming down to my goal before I make any major decisions. I may or may not do hormonal changes and maybe even start to take estrogen pills but i really dont want my family to find out about it.. thats why im posting here.

But the main reason im posting here is to ask if anyone else had experiences like this or am I actually genderfluid. For now im still counting myself straight till then but want to take some advise from people who had similarities to this telling and  maybe help me with my goals. Again like I said im 245lbs 5'10 22M

I have some defiantly defined shoulders and glad to say have some posture givine me a more boxy shape rather than a tub of lard. NO double chin thank god and am working on the slimming process. I hope by the end of this year ill reach that goal with some luck.

2021-01-05 19:21:02,kr5ir9,3,1,"Hello everyone reading this.

I am not sure where to even start. I (18f) been watching a lot of gay porn lately and you know I’ve always assumed whatever it doesn’t mean anything. I’m bisexual, I sometimes watch lesbian porn as well. 

So I never thought much about it. 

Lately I realised I like the idea of anal. At first I thought what I liked about it is the idea of you know - it being in me... but I’m starting to feel like I prefer the idea of giving rather than receiving like a lot. 

I mean strap-ons are not far from me being a bi girl and all but idk I’ve been feeling guilty about this for a while. And I really started to question my gender. 

It’s not just this, but this is the only thing that makes me feel guilty. I’m not sure how to describe it. 

I also really like male clothing as well as female clothes. I do have a homophobic family and they don’t even know I’m bi... let alone that I’ve been questioning my gender. Every time I like a male piece of clothing my mum makes me feel guilty about it. 

I also really wish I could have short hair. And I have half sleeve tattoos. And I’ve asked myself the big question too... what pronounce makes me feel good....

I kind of came to the conclusion that I don’t care about it. I feel comfortable being called she/he/they. All of them feel like me... I feel like I’m both a girl and a boy and that idea has been really scaring me considering my already homophobic and (even more) transphobic family. 

Also I don’t know what this makes me... am I non-binary? Or gender fluid? What even is the difference? I just don’t even understand a lot of these terms that well I just understand that I identify with both in a way and I’m really scared of what that means or how I’m supposed to date people. 

What if I get with a guy or a girl and I even suggest the idea of anal with me with a freaking strap-on?? I don’t know. I’m just confused, scared of what this means for me and how I’m going to have to be with my environment. 

Is it possible I’m just imagining all this? Or am I just in a lot of denial because I’m scared?

2021-01-06 15:23:47,krpxkx,4,1,"So, first of all, Idk if this kind of post is allowed here. If not, please tell me.

Ok, things are a bit complicated. I'll just try to explain what I feel.

I'm born female, and I think I've been fine with it most of the time. I remember though that I had phases where I wanted to be more like a boy, and I also remember that I've always been extremely happy when someone said that I'm similar to my dad with something.
I really started questioning it when I was 15 (I'm 19 now). I met my mtf girlfriend at 14 which was when I learned about transgender and all other kinds of gender identities.
When I was 15 I started to had days where I suddenly felt disphoria. I wanted to be treated like a boy, look like a boy, sit and be friends with the other boys at school. These days were very rare though, and they still are, like, maybe 10 days a year? Most of the time I don't experience disphoria, which is because I am very androgynous. I have a flat chest and my body isn't very curvy, I have a very neutral face and I don't shave my eyebrows. So most of the time I'm mostly happy with that. Also, most of the time I just feel nonbinary, I don't feel comfortable with either female nor male pronouns. But there are also days where I feel fine with female pronouns and I want to dress and act like a girl, and I have disphoria because my body is too androgynous and I just feel ugly.
Now, the feeling of the gender I am is extremely hard to describe, all I can say is that I can feel it and that I'm either comfortable with how other people see and treat me or not.
I also only have disphoria about my face, body etc, not about genitals. I hate them at all times, tbh.

The problem here is that depending on which gender I am at a time, I totally deny that I could be anything else other than that. So when I feel female, my assigned gender, I think ""I'm completely making this up, I'm totally fine being cis and there's no reason to cause such a drama"".

2021-01-07 07:02:47,ks7x3e,3,1,"So I’ve been bothered by something ever since I first came out to my friends ever, and I am hoping for some tips if anyone has any. 

Whenever I come out to someone (all of my friends I am out to are cis women so far; two lesbians, one bi and two straight), I feel awkward after then. I’m usually so excited that I talk about things and open up about my experience and ask them girl questions and such, but then I internally start screaming. I get mad that I’m talking about myself too much, or always talking about being femme/transitioning too much, or always leading the direction away from them, etc.  They’re all so supportive and I don’t think they’d tell me if they did think I was doing this, but I dunno.

First of all just wanted to say i‘m pretty scared to write about this because i feel pretty alone with this feeling not knowing if this is a thing or not... and i‘m scared to offend people or get judged but here i go


I‘m 27 born as (F) and outet myself as Genderfluid last year. My pronouns are She/ He. I mostly swirl around on the male side and really rarely feel femaleish.

I also found out that i am at least Bisexual. I‘m a late bloomer and just had my first date and kiss with a woman and it was WONDERFUL!

Just got off a 5 year relationship with a wonderful man  before that.

I noticed that people around me seem to have an influence on my Gendefluid side. As an example:

when i was on the date with this woman i felt as maleish as i ever felt. It was wonderful. She also called me a Gentleman which was so cute. All i wanted was to care for her holding her in my arms and she also told me that she now understands what i meant my telling her i‘m genderfluid because she now sees the maleish side on me clearly.

On the other hand i could never „act“ or better said be that way when i was with my ex boyfriend. He automatically made me feel more femaleish...

Is this normal? Do you also experience this?

I feel so bad about this because i question myself telling myself i‘m not worth to be genderfluid ...

Sorry this post is messed up.

I actually bloom in my maleish side and feel very comfortable. So i question myself do i just feel uncomfortable because i‘m finally me?

I hope this isn't in the wrong place! And apologies in advance for the long post...

Over the last few days I've really started trying to come to terms with my own gender identity. I'm not sure why now, specifically, but it's something that's crossed my mind many times over the years (although infrequently).

I present as male every day and have never had any issue with he/him pronouns, but some days I wish I had a choice, you know? I've often fantasised about having a pill or a magic switch I could push every morning to choose if my body was male or female that day.

I honestly can't say how long I've felt this way, but I don't think it's new. I remember being a young kid (pre-teen for sure, maybe even younger than 10?) and sneaking into my sister's bedroom to try on her underwear. As a teen, I once played a female teacher in a drama production and was secretly thrilled at having a reason to wear heels and a wig (although I hated having other people put eyeliner on me, haha).

A couple of years ago my (female) partner was out of the house and I tried on some of her clothes for fun; underwear, a skirt, a couple of dresses. It felt good - exciting, freeing - right up until I caught sight of myself in a mirror: flat chest, body hair, and a beard. I instantly felt ridiculous, ugly, and kind of gross, to the point that I immediately went back to my normal clothes and never tried again.

Is that what people mean when they talk about body dysmorphia?

I don't think I would ever want to transition fully to female, because a lot of the time I like being male! I like having facial hair, wearing suits, and all the rest of it. But not all the time. Sometimes I think I want to be able to wear a pretty dress and look in the mirror and see a girl looking back at me.

I honestly don't know what I'm supposed to do with this!!

The closest words to describe my situation seem to be 'non-binary', 'genderfluid', and/or 'bigender'. I'm not sure exactly which one fits my situation best, if any?

I see so many posts and discussions with people talking about the gender they 'identify' as, but honestly I don't know. Until a few days ago I would definitely have said male, but now I wonder if that's just because it's what I'm used to saying?

How I feel changes all the time and it's intimately tied to physical appearance, i.e. ""Do I want to look like a man or a woman today?"" It's super important to me that I can look in the mirror and feel like I ""pass"", regardless of whether I'm presenting as male or female that day.

Is that valid? Is that enough?

I'm married, but I know my wife would be supportive if I told her. I just don't know if I have the self-confidence to toss out the self-image I've had for 30 years and build a new one.

Plus it seems SO hard to find advice on things like feminine fashion or makeup that's aimed at AMAB NB folks (its almost all targeted at AFAB NB or MtF transitioning with hormones)! I don't even know if I'm really a part of this community yet, but I feel kind of out of place already.

For the last couple of years, I've begun questioning that, and very recently have ""come out"" as someone who is questioning their gender, and trying different pronouns. My two biggest supporters have been my twin sister and my husband. Of course, my parents are presenting a problem, but I knew they would. 

Now my biggest ""issue"" (not really an issue but it just bugs me) is my clothes. I don't have ANY masc presenting clothing options in my home. My husband is much taller and thinner than I am, so I can't really wear his clothing, and even if I HAD the money to get some new clothes, you can't try anything on in stores right now (for obvious reasons) so I'd have to just buy the clothes in my supposed sizes, take them home, try them on, and return them if they don't fit, which is a little annoying. (I technically could shop online, but that's extremely difficult as a plus size person) 

On top of that, my hair is at a weird length where I can't put it up, but it's almost too long to style with gel, and the only semi-masc thing I can think to do with it is put a beanie on. (I actually like that look, tbh).

Holy ramble, Batman, get to the point!

Does anyone have any tips on:

1) How to tell if you're non-binary or genderfluid?

2) How I should go about trying out masc clothes for the first time? 

3) Any recommended do's and don'ts when it comes to masc presenting when you never have before?

2021-01-10 14:15:24,kuf5sk,4,1,"I have been questioning my gender identity for a long time, and I have too many questions with nowhere to really turn to. And the debates on reddit on this topic confuses me even more, because i never see an answer that completely addresses/resolves the question — am i delusional/or true for feeling genderfluid?

Here are my lists of questions in hopes someone can help me.

1. A lot of threads and discussions on whether “genderfluid” is a real term seem to come from people who have observed people who identify as genderfluid as an attention seeking, trend following people. How do YOU define the term genderfluid? What IS the official definition of genderfluid?

2. Genderfluidity vs Gender Expression. 
Some people say that Gendefluid is an identity (who you are) which is separate from gender Expression (clothes you wear, and how you carry yourself). 

Some people say this is not true because they are synonymous. 

Some people say the term gender itself is only an outward expression and a social construct. 
—&gt; this last statement would then imply that the term genderfluid literally means “gender-is-not-real-bc social- construct”. If so, wouldn’t the term “genderfluid” be synonymous to meaning a regular “human being”, because then isn’t everyone, at their core, is genderfluid? Shouldn’t there be a better term for it instead of genderfluid, if it even exists?

What is the truth?

3. More on genderfluidity vs gender expression.
Some people say that people confuse genderfluid with gender expression, and label themselves as genderfluid. Would you say that this is a common mistake people make and put bad impressions on the actually genderfluid community, hence convincing cis-het people and even other lgbtq people that this isnt something thats real?
Ex.) ‘i feel like wearing and presenting as male /or masculine today although yesterday I wanted to rock some feminine vibes. So i must be genderfluid.’

4. What does it actually feel like to be a genderfluid person on a day-to-day, week-to-week - month-to-month basis (and whenever you experience this switch)? I want to hear it straight from them instead of other people speaking for them.

5. Some have defined Genderfluid as not being fine with being either gender, but as having Dysphoria of being either one. Would you agree? Or not? And why?

6. Some have said the term genderfluid came about for those with lower dysphoria than binary trans. Basically, they have dysphoria that comes and goes, but not extreme enough to completely want to be the other gender. Would you agree? Why or why not?

7. Some have said the term genderfluid is not real BECAUSE of said definition in #6. They say having some dysphoria doesn’t mean you are actually switching between genders. It just means you are experiencing dysphoria— and that there are good dysphoria days, and not so good dysphoria days. Would you agree? Why or why not?

8. Is genderfluid just a more confusing term for Non-binary?

9. If you are fine being any genders, with minimal dysphoria, are you still genderfluid? Or are you a cis person who is very comfortable with who they are as a person?

I'm afab and 30, basically I've always felt different and not 100% like a girl, but since I've lived in a society that is very anti-LGBT and into traditional gender roles, and also pretty authoritarian upbringing where I couldn't even choose my clothes, I never gave it much thought. But I always knew deep down I wasn't comfortable with being 100% girl, but... what other options are there?


Then I moved across the world and discovered that people can be much more diverse and it's great. Also completely by chance I made a lot of queer friends and they took me to queer places, I met a few nonbinary people and I just... want to be like them and look like them soo much. It's like an image of myself I always had in mind and now it was in front of me.


Thing is... I'm 30. I've always presented as a female. I am in a commited relationship with a guy, he's the love of my life and I don't want to change that. I'm not really attracted to girls (or anyone else beside my husband for that matter, but I def prefer men). I don't want this to be me jumping on the queer bandwagon because I think they're cool now or something. I never had to endure the hardships they go through every day. I'm not transgender, so choosing something ""inbetween"" feels like an ""easy way"" to be part of the queer community. (I hope I'm not offending anyone, your identity is 100% valid, it's just how I think about myself). I don't want anyone to perceive it like that so I haven't told anyone. I'm afraid my queer friends will judge me. I wouldnt blame then tbh.


But this realization hit me like a year ago and was becoming clearer and clearer. I have mild dysphoria, I wish I had smaller breasts and wasnt so curvy. I chopped off my hair but I pass for a female no matter what. I cant even choose new clothes because of the lockdown and it's hot af where I live right now so it's not like there are many options anyway.


So. Thank you if you've read this far. I hope I haven't offended anyone, I'd live to hear your thoughts. If you tell me I'm a silly girl who is too far in her head I'll take that.

I trust you with all mu heart and I hope you accept me. 

I'm genderfluid and pansexual. I'll try my best to explain these things since you probably don't know. Being genderfluid means that I'm not just a girl or a boy, or anything in-between. Sometimes I feel like a girl, sometimes like a boy, sometimes like neither, and sometimes like both at the same time. I would also like to tell you that I have a bit of dysphoria with my breasts sometimes, but not all the time. The binder I got awhile back does help with the dysphoria alot and I'm so glad you let me get it.

Now moving on to what pansexual means. To me it's that I don't really care about my significant other's gender or sex. As long as they love me and treat me with respect then I'd be happy with them. I'm attracted to men, women, and those in-between. I know it might be kinda confusing, but I hope you understand.

I don't think I want to change my name cause I'm fine with it. There isn't much that I want to change about myself other than my self-esteem. I honestly love you which is why I'm writing this to you.

Hi everyone, I'm a pan pal, who always thought they were cishet, turns out I was wrong, so now I'm a closeted genderfluid pal.

So, I was born a guy, and only recently (few months) started questioning my gender, but never experienced severe dysphoria or euphoria, that is until tonight (I just woke up).

So in this dream I was my usual self, skiing in the mountains etc, and at some point I went to a toilet to wash my hands etc, being REALLY pissed about a bunch of stuff.

So I get there and, before I can do anything else, I see myself in the mirror.

Everything else got erased from my mind.

In the mirror was a beautiful girl, more or less my age, her hair made more curly and lifted by the helmet, a light brown with some darker parts and the highlights in just the right spots, I could touch my hair and I felt it just like that, long, beautiful, I could style it easily because of the helmet's effect on it, it was like touching and moving around a cloud...

I had never been happier, I started in awe to my own reflection for a bit, I was so happy that I woke up... But in another dream, where I ran to one of my best friends, screaming how beautiful I felt etc, end then my alarm went off (irl) and I went to pick my phone and started writing about it to another friend (the only person who I'm out to in person), and now I'm here wandering how that could have happened and hoping I see that beautiful girl in the mirror when I look at my reflection, just to see my old boring self every single time...

I didn't know something like this could happen, so I'm kinda shocked (pleasantly), and I'm the happiest I've ever been in quite a long time.

I thought I'd write it here, since you're probably the ones who would understand me best, and I felt that I had to tell about it to someone who could actually understand how I felt...

So yeah, I guess this was it, thank you for reading!

I'm asking two questions and I'm asking because I want to understand more and be able to empathise more. The same as when I hear intolerance towards people based on race etc, I can't challenge someone if I don't understand the picture. 

So my questions are :-

Gender - i get confused about why people label gender fluid. To me gender is a biological thing in nature, so pretty much nature has male and female. My understanding is its more to do with sexuality, so its about how you feel in terms of attraction etc. Growing up I was aware of heterosexual, homosexual, bi-sexual and trans-sexual. I see the current sexuality landscape as an evolution of that but again, its sexuality related, not gender - what in your eyes defines the difference between being gender fluid and sexuality fluid?

For me if your gender is female then it defines some parts of you biologically? For example, menstruation, ovary issues, uterus issues etc so medically you are a female and some medical issues are attributed to your gender. Likewise a male identifying as a female would still be exposed to risks like testicular cancer etc that a female gender wouldn't be.

My second question is about the focus on them/they, for example someone i work with has their name and then them/they after it on their email signature. Likewise I don't have he/his on mine. Is this just an awareness thing? Obviously making it obvious that they wish to be addressed this way. I have no issue with it, I'm just curious as to what the reasoning behind it may be.

I'm all for identifying yourself how you want, its not hurting or harming anyone and so long as you feel loved, understood, valued etc thats all I care about as a member of humanity. I just want to understand it more, so that in conversation I can understand the reasons behind it. I know that awareness is massively important on things like this, people have the right to choose how they wish to live their lives, its the same with people who fight for civil rights etc in the black community (I'm a white male in my 40s) I just want to know how its perceived and the reasons behind it from those of you who identify this way. 

I'm a working class male in the UK and I’ve a lot of friends who are your typical lager lout, intolerant etc. I like challenging their thinking etc to try and show them everybody in this world has a right to be who they want to be, some cultures accept that more than others so again, please understand I'm extremely tolerant etc, I'm just curious and want to understand and educate myself more.

I recently asked my wife about what if I used they/them pronouns. She has recoginzed my femme leanings peaking through. 
She had a bunch of questions I wasn't fully sure how to answer.
I've always felt different. I felt ""boy"" for most of my childhood and began experimenting (ie light make up and gender neutral clothing) early in high school but was bullied pretty hard, made fun of, beat up so I just retreated into presenting male stereotype to fit in. 
I always liked when girlfriends would want to do my hair or paint my nails. Here and there I'd wear their swim suit tops while they were gone and it was nice feeling more femme. It felt good. 
My first serious girlfriend as well as my first wife looked down on me for having feminine tendencies or if I suggested I wanted to dress as female for Halloween(felt like a safe way to express myself) I'd be met with disgust. 

It wasn't until was divorced living on my own when I felt free to explore more. Ive gotten a little more comfortable expressing what I like. 
When I grow my hair long I feel good but then days I feel ""butch"" I end up chopping it then regretting it the next day because I look too much like a ""man"". Sometimes I like growing my beard but I also don't like what I look like with body hair.
I like wearing makeup when I want to feel pretty but sometimes in the middle of the day ill feel wrong wear it and then I few hours later it feels right again.

So my wife was asking ""do I feel like a Male"" and I didn't know how to reply because I enjoy having a penis but I don't feel like any of the men I seen or known. Am I ""just a guy"" who likes to express both masculine and feminine, am I androgynous or gender fluid?

I don't know how to verbally explain it because I don't fully have handle myself. I feel like ME but I don't know what I mean by it though. Every answer I can think to give feels wrong. 
I'm confused and feel like I'm suppose to ""claim"" some sort of category but I don't fit. Being in my mid 30's I'd think I would have more of a handle on who oor what I am. 
She wants to know how to support me the best she can, its hard to produce any answers other than just love me.
Thanks for reading my rambling.

How do people know when they can/should go by ""they/them""?
What helped you come to terms with how you feel or explain how you feel to others? 
Does journaling or any books help?
Is it ok to not want to talk about it with loved ones?

But at random times I just feel kind of different? I have the urge to hide my chest and kind of wish it was flat? Usually I think my breasts are fine and I actually like that they’re there because they make me feel feminine and junk, but at these times I completely want them gone, they aren’t big or bother me in anyway other than being there. I also put my hair up and/or really want to just cut most of it off. In general I just have the urge to try and be more masculine, but not like a masculine woman I guess? I’m not sure, I’m not even sure where the feelings are coming from or if I might just be making them up or going insane in quarantine but I don’t think I’m doing it for attention since there’s no one to really tell it to around me.

2021-01-17 06:11:23,kz0y3u,6,1,"Hi! I'm new here(bio male 16), recently(late December) came out to myself as genderfluid(haven't told the folks yet, not because I don't think they'd accept me, but because I would rather not go through an awkward conversation... yeah, I suppose, secondary question, send help please?) and have been wondering what to call myself whenever I feel particularly feminine over neutral or masculine, as my given name, Joaquin, is pretty heavily masculine but also a name that I'm deeply attached to. I don't want to give up my birth name, but I also don't want to lock myself into a masculine name that doesn't always fit me. I thought about just using my nickname, which is Jae, whenever I don't feel particularly male, but I found that didn't really fit me whenever I felt female either. So I started thinking about whether a second name for my female self would make the most sense, and workshopping a few names for that... hard to describe the emotion it brought? Good, I think, more a sense of rightness than anything else(currently leaning towards Jaylani, for the curious, as I like the sound of it and it allows me to use the same nickname no matter how I'm oriented in a given moment), but then a worry that using more than one name was maybe kind of weird and would be seen as confusing or obnoxious or *both* arrived in my head, and that obviously felt significantly less good. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I've arrived here with that question: is having more than one name to call myself by and, to ask others to call me by, valid? Am I just experiencing some kind of split-personality weirdness? I've never met any genderfluid people; the closest I know is my partner who's enby, so I don't have any kind of benchmark to use. Please advise, and thanks in advance! I'm very happy to be here, even if calling myself LGBT still feels a little strange to me, since I figured I was cis male my whole life up until very recently.

So I started thinking about whether a second name for my female self would make the most sense, and workshopping a few names for that... hard to describe the emotion it brought? Good, I think, more a sense of rightness than anything else(currently leaning towards Jaylani, for the curious, as I like the sound of it and it allows me to use the same nickname no matter how I'm oriented in a given moment), but then a worry that using more than one name was maybe kind of weird and would be seen as confusing or obnoxious or *both* arrived in my head, and that obviously felt significantly less good. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I've arrived here with that question: is having more than one name to call myself by and, to ask others to call me by, valid? Am I just experiencing some kind of split-personality weirdness? I've never met any genderfluid people; the closest I know is my partner who's enby, so I don't have any kind of benchmark to use. Please advise, and thanks in advance! I'm very happy to be here, even if calling myself LGBT still feels a little strange to me, since I figured I was cis male my whole life up until very recently.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for a bit of a long post, but hopefully y'all will get my meaning."", 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'Is more than one name valid?', 'created': 1610889083.0}"

Please no hate) \n\n2: any good alternatives for binders that chonky people could use?? I\'m friggin clueless xD \n\nI\'ll also take any general advice y\'all might have.

2021-01-19 22:33:46,l0v3kf,2,2,"**[TW: severe transphobia later on, will mark where it is in the post.]**

So for context, I’m 15, identify as non-binary male, use he/they pronouns and am AFAB (sadly). I’ve been identifying as trans since I was 10 or 11. Though I have some memories of discomfort beforehand, I’ve mostly forgotten my life before then. My parents claim I never mentioned having dysphoria until I began puberty. I’ve socially transitioned to male and everyone refers to me by my chosen name and male pronouns, which feels much more comfortable and authentic. Really, I’ve never felt at such peace with myself.

However, recently I’ve began questioning my gender again. I’ve come to the conclusion, given my dysphoria and how much more at peace I feel living as male, that I’m unlikely to be female. But I don’t know if I’m non-binary or male. I genuinely can’t tell if I prefer he/him or they/them, they legitimately just both work fine with me. My dysphoria fluctuates, so I think that sometimes I lean male but sometimes I lean non-binary. But I never feel not male, just sometimes also non-binary. Somewhere between the two, maybe?

Honestly... I don’t think I’m masculine enough to be binary male? I have pretty much every feminine trait that you can name and consider myself gender non-conforming. I’ve been told by people that I should want to be as much like a cis male as possible, rather than a soft, hairless, pretty anime boy (which I tend to envision myself as). So can I really be a transsexual male? I don’t want facial hair, body hair, large muscles... I don’t want to be what’s deemed “masculine”... I’d be so uncomfortable... that just isn’t me...

I wish I was cis male, then I’d be able to be as feminine or GNC as I’d like without being accused of being a trender or experiencing dysphoria. I legit just want to be a pretty boy. I want a male body, as in I’d really like to have a flat chest and penis but I’d also like slight curves, but in an androgynous male way, rather than having no gender? Though I think a genderless body would be cool, I feel most comfortable with a packer, so I think I’d be most comfortable with a penis, but just not... manly, in a traditional sense.

And I’m not sure I belong in male spaces either? **[TRANSPHOBIA]** I feel as if... I don’t belong there because I’m not *’really’* a guy, right? I’m a female-bodied person who *identifies* as male, and not even entirely male. How will they react, well, when they find out... I’m not “really” one of them? I feel like an imposter, a faker, someone hiding a serious secret from the rest of the group, as if I’m infiltrating male spaces and shouldn’t be accepted in them. I can’t tell if this means I’m NB or internally transphobic.

I’ve been seeing gender therapists at GIDS for over a year now but haven’t had the chance to mention this to them. And I wonder... is this really a medical issue? Could I not just be internally misogynistic? Am I just a GNC girl? Am I having my natural feelings pathologized?Why don’t I feel like I truly belong in male, female or enby spaces? I’m not planning on anything irreversible until I’m 18... not that I had any choice anyways. Is gender critical ideology getting to me? I’m not mentally stable enough to know, maybe.

I don’t know my gender... so I just identify as non-binary male because I consider myself to be between non-binary and male on a gender spectrum. I don’t know who I am, what I want, what I should do, how I should feel, what I want to identify as... I’m so lost. What should I do? I feel like if I don’t get on T soon, I won’t get the best results. I don’t want to be stuck in a female body... I’m scared to tell anyone... although some friends do...

I identify as a genderqueer woman, but for awhile now I've experienced a real uncomfortableness with feeling too feminine or too masculine in the way that is for me. When I was a bit younger, I realized I wasn't straight so I experimented with my fashion. I tried button ups and looking more masc, but it made me want to cry whenever I walked outside and I didn't want anyone to see me.

Earlier today I tried wearing a tighter crop top that was quite revealing so I could feel good and take pictures for my partner, but even though I knew I ""looked good"" my face fell when I saw the pictures. I kind of brushed it off and didn't think much, because I figured I just didn't like looking at pictures of myself. And maybe it was in that case. But a little while later I just became extremely uncomfortable with how I felt. Not the fabric or the tightness of the clothes, but the way it made me feel changed. The exposed skin in that feminine way, my breasts, etc. I didn't like it. So I put on some men's underwear that I bought just for comfort and a sports bra under a baggy sweatshirt and it just felt right. I felt satisfaction inside. 

It's confusing to me, because while I believe I experience dysphoria, it's not always like this. I tend to lean towards a couple of sides.

I don't think I experience gender dysphoria (at least not severe), from what I heard it's supposed to make you feel like your trapped in your own body, though I'm not sure I'm completely cis, I gonna list some things that makes me think that:

Ok for a couple of months I've been wondering about if I was cis or not. It was mainly because I referred myself as a her at one point but it didn't feel right. But at first I thought 'Oh it's just my pronouns'. Quite recently at times I didn't really comfortable with referring myself as a female or girl, so I referred myself male internally, when I felt female didn't fit, I didn't necessarily feel male but the label made me comfortable. All this sounds fine and well so far right? But quite recently I started to feel a gender that doesn't fit in the binary, the only way I can describe it that it feels like a void if that makes sense? It's not a bad feeling (other than first time I experienced it), so is it possible that I might be trans?

Points that I feel like I should mention:

•  I felt the void feeling since I eight, I didn't think it was gender related though

• Sometimes my name doesn't feel like my own, when that happens I usually refer myself as the name void internally, same when I feel no pronouns fit me. Again, I pretty sure I felt this since I was eight (I only started to refer myself as void recently, only to myself).

• Usually when my gender just feels void, that's when pronouns actually are important to me, I would get quite uncomfortable if someone called me my usual name/nickname or if someone would refer me as a she or a he or even a they, I just rather be called void.

• I get uncomfortable when I wear things that are usually labelled feminine (dresses, makeup, etc, etc)

I just want someone say either ""Your probably cis"" or ""Heyyyo that could be considered some lesser form of (insert type of dysphoria)"" or something else.

It was mainly because I referred myself as a her at one point but it didn\'t feel right. But at first I thought \'Oh it\'s just my pronouns\'. Quite recently at times I didn\'t really comfortable with referring myself as a female or girl, so I referred myself male internally, when I felt female didn\'t fit, I didn\'t necessarily feel male but the label made me comfortable.

I recently discovered I'm genderflux. (Mostly on the male side of things but sometimes I swing all the way to agender.) And in the future I intend to just live without giving my gender much thought. That said, I'm trying to put a finger on how the changes work - how often I'm genderless, how often I'm fully male, the dynamics of the in-between... Just for a couple months, maybe a year, I want to check a box every day to see if any interesting patterns surface over time. It's not of vital importance of course but I think it would help me understand myself better. And it's a fun thing to do. And something like wearing a coloured band to notify my girlfriend of my current gender status would be neat too.

The problem is that gender, being the mess it is, is sometimes hard to identify for me. I use male language all the time (my language doesn't really do gender neutral terms) so a good gauge is how I feel about that. My dysphoria isn't static either but usually it's related to the female aspects of my body which I hate regardless of current gender. I guess what I'm looking for is some sort of checklist/questionnaire that would help me examine myself at a certain point in time. Or even just a list of things to pay attention to.

2021-01-22 17:41:59,l2srfk,8,1,"Hi. In advance, i'd like to apologize if this is entirely the wrong subreddit to ask this question. Also, i hope i don't come off as bigoted or intolerant in any way. I hope you all understand, that i am just trying to understand my fellow human beings better. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can wrap my head around genderfluidity just fine. I'm not gonna pretend that i can relate, but it is easy for me to understand that one person may swap from gender A to gender B at any given time. I realize that pronouns for that can be kind of a mess, so it makes sense to me as well, that such an individual might want an ""easy"" way for people to address them. 

&amp;#x200B;

What i don't understand is how we can have more than the two genders. By that i mean for example the difference between pansexual people and bisexual people. I get that the concept of pansexuality is that you're attracted to all genders, and not just the two. What i don't understand is what those genders are. The way i see it, our genders (constructs as they are) originally comes from our sex, which translated into gender, and gender roles. I totally understand how you might identify more with one of those roles than the others, and i see how that identity might swap around. But given that we only have 2 biological sexes, i don't understand what a 3rd gender would be based on. I have heard the whole ""gender is a spectrum"" explanation before, which i don't necessarily disagree with, but the way i understand it, that would make a given person feel X% male and X% Female on a given day, that would be a combination of the two, but i wouldn't call it a third (especially because given how spectrums work, that would make a literal infinite amount of genders, which honestly seems to defeat the purpose of the label at all) 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel often when i have this conversation with my friends, it comes to a point where gender is a thing so specific to the individual, that you may as well call it identity. And we all have unique and interesting personalities and identities, and while i definitely hope my friends respect me for the person they know me as, i wouldn't expect people i don't know, to understand my very intricate identity, and motivations. 

&amp;#x200B;

2021-01-25 03:27:09,l4evsi,0,1,"Hello - I'm new to r/genderlfuid. The reason I'm here is because I feel like I might be. Allow me to explain:

I'm AFAB. For most of my life, at least until recently, I ID'd as cisgender. However, I began to wonder about that.. See, my real name is considered to be a ""boy's name,"" so I've been chronically misgendered growing up by anyone and everyone who didn't know me personally. I also played ""the boy"" when playing house or dolls with my sisters, even when \*also\* playing a girl. As a sister to three sisters, I always felt like I was ""the brother they never had.""

I wouldn't say I ""don't mind"" being mistaken for a Mr., but it happened so much so long in my life that I don't really even bat an eye anymore; I almost never get offended anymore. What's more is that I always recognized that I was bigger, taller, deeper-voiced (I can absolutely impersonate a man at the drop of a dime) and less 'conventional' of a girl growing up (I also recognize I'm gray-ace, so that played a part I imagine). Didn't hop aboard the make-up train very long; was seen as a ""tomboy"" quite a bit. I don't think I reached my peak femininity until.. hmm.. young adult years?

There were many moments in my life - to this day - where I feel different ways throughout the day/week/month. For instance: Today I woke up feeling androgynous; then I felt more feminine as the day progressed. Then masculinity kicked in for a little while; now I'm back more or less between feminine and androgynous.

The thing is: I also feel.. silly? Like I'm misappropriating 'genderfluid,' because I don't have ""gender dysphoria"" (not sure I ever did - if anything, I experience a rush of giddiness and badass-ness when I'm feeling a gender shift). I also still go by - and am quite comfortable with - she/her pronouns. So yea.. if anything I've seen and read from others' experiences as genderfluid folks, I feel like an imposter.",genderfluid,Am I..?,1611570429.0,"{'created_utc': 1611545229, 'id': 'l4evsi', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Hello - I\'m new to r/genderlfuid.

I am 28yo male who cannot help himself stop loving feminine things such as dresses, hairstyles, skirts, activities etc. It never leaves me so far, I dont know why, I dont know that I want it to leave me... But I love these things since I am 5 years old!  


The country where I live in, people are not open minded, so I never got a chance to discover myself. But after a year I will be in somewhere else, most probably US.   
I have a girlfriend for a long time, she is also not an open minded person and never knows me in that way. She tried to make me wear dresses of herself before but it was only a one time joke, she will not accept me in that way. 

on the other hand, even if I like feminine things and dream myself as a more feminine structure, due to that I never got a chance to discover myself I dont know what it brings to me. for example I feel feminine but I never get any feelings for any man? But also I never met a man while I'm completely dressed and girly. Maybe I will like a man? I dont know. I am always interested in girls. Sometimes I think that I am a mostly bisexual girl, who has a male body?! 

BTW, almost everyting that I want to wear or do or make is girly. for example I never go shopping in the way I want, always feel obliged to shop from brands who sell male clothes. or I have never gone any club while there is short black dress on my body. I have never gone a coffee shop and order a coffee for me while  I wear skinny jeans and heeled boots... I will definetly try these things after I move to US,... but it's still a year to go there and cannot stand anymore, think I'm losing my mind.

Lately I have been wondering if I am genderfluid. Because of the pandemic, I have been interacting more online, and I've noticed that I sometimes like it when people can't tell my gender or perceive me as male (I am biologically female). Because of this I've been experimenting with different pronouns and doing some major self reflection, but I still don't know if I'm on the right track.

Here are my biggest sticking points. One, if I really am genderfluid, why didn't I realize it before now? I am 19. Would I not have realized I didn't line up with my assigned gender all the time during puberty? Or when I first learned that people could be genderfluid? During childhood I often didn't act or dress femininely, but I don't remember necessarily having thoughts of hating myself for being a girl. I thought it was just rebelling against gender norms, not my actual gender. During highschool I sometimes got uncomfortable when people used she/her for me, but not all the time, and again I thought it was just my resistance to gender norms. Also, I've never exactly hated my sex characteristics. When I feel more masculine or genderless I feel like my breasts aren't attached to me or don't belong to me, like they're separate objects, but that's not the same as hatred. I know at times I like the idea of things like binding and using he/him, but could I really just be a cis woman who might enjoy dressing more butch? I can think of times when I felt very strongly male or nonbinary, but how do I know what that really feels like to be able to identify it?

I read an article that said that teens often experience what they think is gender dysphoria when they have a lot of trans friends and they have no other way to describe their self-consciousness. It said those people are looking for a magical solution to all their problems, and they think transition will do that for them. That could be me, I've never had as many trans friends as I do now - but I also listed off some signs from way before I knew any trans people. I'm not trying to magically solve all my problems, I'm just looking for an answer to these questions that seemingly hit me from out of the blue.

Is it normal to realize these things so late? I know nobody other than me can decide my gender identity, but some advice would be appreciated. Don't hold back - don't tell me what I'm feeling is real if it's actually not. I don't want to be supported if I'm being delusional, I just want some help from people more experienced with these things than me.

I guess I’ve always felt kinda odd about gender. I looked into it briefly in secondary and thought something might be off but there was always stuff going on that was more important or I’d just avoid the subject. But I guess I’ve been thinking about it more because I’m finally in a better place mentally and there’s not as many distractions rn...

But yea I realised when I first got with my current boyfriend that I didn’t really think I was feminine enough to be a good girlfriend / an attractive enough prospect to date as a woman,, so I tried really hard to do dress more womanly, do hair and makeup, wear things that actually showed off curves or a feminine figure. I usually dress in oversized clothes that swamp me but I guess it was to sort of,,, I guess validate that I was good enough as a woman to be a mans girlfriend?? I didn’t feel comfortable but I did feel like I was succeeding for a little while.

But I kept feeling very uncomfortable physically and started dying my hair loads more than usual or changing things up or experimenting with new styles to find the thing that I would feel comfortably feminine in. It got to the point that my scalp got really hurt by how often I was changing my hair colour because I kept looking in the mirror and feeling really uncomfortable with what I saw. Then I just kinda looked in the mirror and just felt too much like a woman every time I guess?? And I think that was part of the reason I took all the hair off suddenly,, apart from needing to help my scalp heal I needed to change severely,, and I had very big fluffy hair so it was a really big thing to take away for me,, as I like to use my hair to hide a bit.

I’ve always had days where I feel kinda sick or gross when people refer to me femininely or as a girl,, or I feel a nasty shock or displacement go through my system when people would call my name. I never really understood why and whenever I’d start to think about it I’d stop myself or avoid it. I didn’t understand why some days it I got complimented I would feel great,, and others I’d feel anxious and sick and a little scared. Or how some days I could dress femininely and feel great,, but was more comfortable dressing oversized because some days it made me feel so wrong.

I do fantasise loads about being a man,, or start thinking I’d be more comfortable as one some days. I’ll think intently what I’d look like,, or fantasising about being able to switch between male and female at the click of my fingers. 

As I said,, sometimes I feel great being a girl,, but other days I don’t want people to see me or I want to cover up or I feel like I’m not meant to have hips or curves or breasts,, and I’m meant to be taller and stronger and I feel like I don’t fit well in my own body. Like some days I’ll be suddenly a lot more insecure around my boyfriend seeing me. It just kinda makes me feel very wrong and very uncomfortable I guess to be seen as feminine sometimes? 

But there’s a big part of me thinking that maybe everyone feels like this and I’m overreacting a lot,, or I’ve even considered that maybe I’m just secretly a massive misogynist :/
