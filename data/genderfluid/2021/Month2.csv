I don't feel any connection to being a male/masculine though. Are there any other gender fluid people on here who don't really ever fluctuate to male but are fluid between agender/enby/female?

first, i identified as a trans guy. i knew i wasn’t a girl, so that was like my only option. then, i identified as non-binary. then, i started big time doubting myself and was a cis girl. then i was non-binary again. i found out about labels inside non-binary and was agender, then demiboy, micro-boy, gender flux. for about a month i’ve been riding with genderfluid. let me tell you why.

at first, i identified as genderfluid because i liked it more than the agender community and i could relate to it more. it had less bad connotations to me. i could present masc and femme and andro and that wouldn’t be invalidated by so many people. i could use multiple pronouns. my gender shifts and changes slowly but surely. the term freed me of so many things that held me back.

2021-02-07 23:46:17,leywl9,2,1,"Ok, I'm newly out (amab) and one of my biggest barriers to presenting more fem is facial hair. 

I def like my beard when it grows it in but my skin is a persnickety bitch and it's a constant struggle if I want to shave for a few days. Realistically if I shave more than about twice a week I'm dealing with the fallicle out (get it?) all week.

2021-02-11 08:34:10,lhgei3,0,1,"Hi you lovely people,

I'm a social psychologist who studies the negative effects of the gender/sex binary ([http://psychology.exeter.ac.uk/staff/profile/index.php?web\_id=Thekla\_Morgenroth](http://psychology.exeter.ac.uk/staff/profile/index.php?web_id=Thekla_Morgenroth)). I'm in the process of running studies on identity denial of gender minorities. The first study focuses on misgendering of binary trans people, but in future research we will also focus on non-binary identities. I'm looking for volunteers who would be willing to provide photos of themselves presenting in ""masculine"" and ""feminine"" ways (i.e. what society deems masculine and feminine). More detailed information about the photos and the study itself below. I unfortunately have no funds to pay anyone, but you would contribute to research on a really important topic (and I would thank you in any research articles that come out of this, if you want; if you prefer to remain anonymous, that is of course also fine!).

If you are interested, please just comment here, send me a message, or e-mail me (e-mail address can be found in my profile, see above).

Many thanks!

Additional information:

1) The photos: 

Please provide four photos of yourself, two in which you present in a stereotypically masculine way (i.e. how people expect men to look) and one in which you present in a stereotypically feminine way (i.e. how people expect women to look). One image should be of your whole body, the other one should focus primarily on your face.

For both pictures, try to think of norms in society and how women and men do – and are expected to – present, not exaggerated images of femininity and masculinity.

For the “feminine” picture, consider the following options (these are examples – you don’t have to adhere to / use all of these and can also use other ways to convey femininity)

*  Wear make-up
* No facial hair
* “feminine” clothing such as dresses, tight fitting clothes, skirts etc
* Jewellery such as earrings, necklaces etc
* Visibly long hair or short hair that is styled in a “feminine” way
* “feminine” pose (e.g. legs close together)

For the “masculine” pictures, consider the following options (again, these are just examples):

* No make-up
* Facial hair
* “masculine” clothing such as a suit and tie, baggy clothing, muscle shirts, hats etc
* No jewellery that is considered feminine
* Short hair or hidden long hair (e.g. under hat, pulled back)
* “masculine” pose (e.g. legs further apart)

For all pictures, please have a neutral facial expression (do not smile or frown)

For all pictures, please choose a relatively neutral background (e.g. in front of a wall)

2) About the project: Despite recent increases in visibility of and support for trans individuals, they continue to face pervasive discrimination. In this project we investigate one form of discrimination that has been under-studied in the psychological literature on gender: identity denial. We argue that trans people, but not cis people, risk having their gender denied if they do not perform their gender “right”, that is, adhere to gender norms and stereotypes in their appearance and behavior. Participants will be presented with pictures of individuals who were assigned male at birth or female at birth who present in either stereotypically feminine or masculine ways. In addition, the information about the individual will explicitly state their gender identity (woman or man). Participants will describe the individual in a short paragraph (used for coding which pronouns were used), respond to identity-affirming or denying questions (e.g., whether the target should use the men’s/women’s restroom), and explicitly place the target on a woman-man spectrum. We predict that gender presentation will lead to identity denial (misgendering), particularly when the stated gender identity does not match the gender assigned at birth, as would be the case for trans people.",genderfluid,I'm a researcher studying identity denial of gender minorities and am looking for volunteers,1613057650.0,"{'created_utc': 1613032450, 'id': 'lhgei3', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Hi you lovely people,\n\nI\'m a social psychologist who studies the negative effects of the gender/sex binary ([http://psychology.exeter.ac.uk/staff/profile/index.php?web\\_id=Thekla\\_Morgenroth](http://psychology.exeter.ac.uk/staff/profile/index.php?web_id=Thekla_Morgenroth)).

I want peace and equality just like you do, i just feel there are certain things we, as a progressive community, should let go. with that being said, enjoy:

&amp;#x200B;

I am a young black man born into poverty and abuse and struggle. These things and my bisexuality among other things have made me want to change the world on an enormous scale. And I mean true change. I would like to make it so everyone on earth has equal opportunities and education and rights and so much more involving animal protection, earth protection and more. I don't like to identify with a specific political group because it's too general for me. To identify with a certain group kind of automatically gives you a certain set of beliefs that I haven't had the time or the energy to look into all of one to feel that group identifies me fully. With that being said I do share the majority of beliefs with the liberal and leftist communities.

I say the latter to essentially say that I care for all people and their equality and rights equally. I want nothing more than to have ignorance for different people eliminated because ignorance breeds chaos and hatred. It's just that this community specifically I feel is more damaging than progressive. And here is the reason why.

Social Constructs

I think we can all agree that there are positive and negative constructs. Without social constructs and things like philosophy and ideology which aid constructs, we wouldn't have a way of life at all let alone one that has semi positive general morals and standards that assists in keeping order in society. I think one of those positive social constructs is labels. By naming things separately, we open the door of acknowledging their differences. We can give them definitions to understand them better. And this is a good thing. Differences should always be acknowledged to be embraced. Definitions allow us to understand the thing more. The main construct I'm referring to at this point is race. I learned from Jane Elliot that we should see color. We should want to see diversity amongst our communities big or small. Black people are not the same as white people in many different ways such as culture and background and history and that's a good thing. In the least it's less boring. In the most, it increases a person's knowledge of the world and how different people can be. One thing i need to express though is that this of course does not affect someone's equality. As Jane Elliot said as well, there really is only one race. The human race. In a species sort of sense. Everyone is equal no matter what and deserves equal respect and rights which is important for the continuation of my point.

I think that the social construct of a man and a woman are positive social constructs and aren't even social constructs at all. I believe they're not even social constructs because they are as real as death and pain and trees and growth. They are physical things that exist with or without human input and that humans have just labeled them. In nature, there is a male and a female in all species. There isn't a third sex and if there are times when there are intersexual people, they still favor the concept of two sexes because they one; adopt the traits of one or the other sex as they grow older showing which genitalia didn't belong and two; they only posses two types of genitalia and no third one. Now i've heard that the non binary/ gender community aren't referring to sex and specifically only gender but if you aren't, don't you think it's contradictory to use words that are associated with sex? Such as ""he"" and ""she"" and ""man"" and ""woman"". These are synonymous with ""male"" and ""female"", societal constructs which i previously stated i think should be embraced for their differences and not generalized. You're literally using sex terms and wonder why people can't get on board with something so illogical. Gender being one of them. 

It was only in my recent years that i began to hear gender as something other than referring to someones sex. For my entire life my understanding was that sex and gender were synonymous and i'm pretty sure that goes for majority of the english speaking population as well. Correct me if I'm wrong. It seems to me that it somewhat is the same with this community as well because they use sex terms such as pronouns but it apparently isn't because they say they don't identify with their “assigned” sex. (assigned in parentheses because it isn't assigned by society or doctors, it's who you are) it’s contradictory.

My general understanding is that people who identify as being on the gender spectrum as non binary, woman when they are male, man when they are female, etc is that they feel their gender is associated with how they feel in regards to masculinity and femininity BUT THAT'S JUST IT! If my definition is correct, that means that gender spectrum is a negative social construct! Because masculinity and femininity are social constructs, negative ones at that, that should be torn down. You as a biological woman shouldn't identify with the opposite gender(by that i mean sex) because you feel you're more masculine and a man shouldn't identify as a woman because they feel more feminine. It's like when my father used to call me a girl for rolling eyes. It's TOXIC! Masculinity and femininity are toxic because they are social constructs that tell you how a man and a woman should act when there is no specific way you should act as a man or woman and you built your entire basis of the gender spectrum off of that. As a man/male you dress how you want and feel like a man. It's not feminine just because society says it is. It's not masculine either. It's you! And that shouldn’t change who you are biologically (your pronouns and sex identification terms such as man or woman)

I think it gets in the way of real change because the real change is tearing down the social constructs of masculinity and femininity so that men and women can express themselves and be themselves however they want, but it really just supports those social constructs by acknowledging their existence as a definite thing when its not while not acknowledging a definite thing like sex, gender, and pronouns being labels based off of natural and real existence and not just a made up concept and the terms being synonymous with one another when it is. Let me put it this way, a woman who dresses how she wants but identifies as a man because she dresses as what she would call “masculine” isn't helping women like her who want to dress that way as well because to society, the woman that identifies as male, is male. She is fitting into social constructs. A man dressing masculine. She's abandoning the fight to tear down the construct of how women should express themselves. And the same goes for non binary people. By you not having a specific gender, you are abandoning the fight to defy the norms that plague your “assigned” sex/gender. It's not progressive. In my opinion.

Some more examples I think fit into the non progressive logic of the gender spectrum is when you want to refer to a woman as king instead of queen or use God instead of goddess or actor instead of actress. You give the male side more power as if it's the original word and the female form of the word is just a play off of it and therefore is less than. That's not true (maybe it being a play off is in some cases but its level of worth isn't unless you make it that way.). A queen is just as good as a king. An actress is worth just as much as an actor. A goddess is just as valid a term as a god.

As a side note i feel i should express my views on the transgender community who i respect and support. To me there are four sexes/genders. Biological male and female/ man and woman and Transexual/transgender male and female/man or woman. With That logic, transgender people have a right to their respective pronouns and from a medical stand point which shouldn't concern you most of the time, the pronouns may be opposite. Four genders but two sets of pronouns. 

I've tried my best to understand this community so I can be onboard. Im pro lgbt, pro blm, etc but i can't get behind this. Sometimes it seems to me that white people who aren't gay or trans just want to find a way they can be oppressed. I still am open to having my mind changed on this subject because, I feel, one of the most important things to have, even on a subject you feel is a part of your very being, is an open mind. Be open to having your mind changed but throw all your arguments and logic towards it before you do so and if they can change your mind, you have no choice but to be open to it. Unless you're illogical and refuse to listen and believe logical arguments simply because you don't want to.

Really, I just have a few questions for y’all. I’d really appreciate any and all help! &lt;3

1) How often/how quickly each day do you determine which gender to identify/express yourself as?

2) Do your pronouns rotate as this happens, or do you stick with one set?

3) What does your gender affect (i.e. clothing, name, lifestyle...)?

I also go to a same sex school (girls) and I really love it there, and I don’t want to be anywhere else, so if I was gender fluid would they send me away?

2021-02-14 22:24:27,ljyxyy,0,1,"So I've been out to most people in my immediate circle as genderfluid for a few years and have asked people close to me to use he/they pronouns since my mid 20s. I'm 29 and more recently I've made the choice to transition to using they/them pronouns. I can trace feelings of dysphoria and euphoria back to early childhood. I was AMAB. 

I vividly remember going through puberty wanting to cut sections of my body off with a kitchen knife, trying and failing to manage hair growth with razors, waxing, depilatories and whatever else I could think of. I remember my first signs of thinning hair at the extremely young age of 20 and how much crippling anxiety it brought. I can remember the fluttering heart and excitement that accompanied my first experience of performing femininity, the way it felt to wear a dress or eyeshadow for the first time. Sometimes I dreamt of waking up a woman, other times I felt perfectly happy as a man and quite often gender just didn't make much difference to me at all. I was not taught much about gender identity growing up. I suppressed most of these feelings until my early 20s and performed masculinity as best I could.  As I hit my mid 20s I came into myself and my understanding of gender and sexuality. I was able to finally recognise myself as genderfluid and sexually fluid (pansexual).

The last five years have not been the most lucid for me, I'm in a much better place now but over the course of five years I was sexually assaulted by someone I worked with and then found myself in an extremely abusive relationship which lasted four years and ended in a yearlong period of infidelity, lying and ultimately the theft of several thousand dollars and many of my belongings. I don't say any of this to gather sympathy so much as to sort of explain that I feel like I'm kind of waking up to myself over the last 8 months or so now that I'm out of a very toxic situation and seeking mental health care, hence why all this is coming up again for me so late in my 20s.

Anyway, I'm back in therapy now and am on an SSRI which has been amazing in a lot of ways but it has also made me question my gender more than ever before. Recently I had a near breakdown where I thought I might have spent my entire life as a trans woman in denial only to wake up a few days ago and feel incredibly warm and safe in a masculine body. Some days I feel as though I should start HRT, that having a feminine body would align itself more with my fluidity and I could present masculine as needed through my clothing choices and style. Other days, the broadness of my chest, my facial hair and shaved head and the hair that covers my body feel like home to me. Honestly though, most days, gender feels pretty useless to me. I've tried journalling to track where I feel I land most often and I think I do wind up either femme or enby on most days but there are those 15-20% of times where my distinctly masculine physique feels like home. Feeling really lost with how to approach this, I know no one can tell me what approach to gender fluidity is right for me but I'd love to hear how some of you have managed to feel at home in your bodies if you've felt the way I described.

2021-02-15 01:55:57,lk2xvz,6,1,"To start this off, I'll explain this:

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what I would call myself and gender fluid seems to fit the bill as best as possible.

I rarely get dysphoria, it's only late at night when I'm sleep deprived and wanting everything in my life to be different that I feel dysphoria. But what I do get, is this overwhelming want to look different. I am perfectly content with who I am, my gender, for the most part, and all that. What I desperately want, is to be able to put on a skirt and a tank-top and be visibly a girl. And then I want to be able to throw on sweatpants and a t-shirt and be visibly a guy. And so what I'm running into it that I don't care about my gender, but I do care about what I look like. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if this is making any sense so far, apologies if it isn't, I am absolutely willing to clarify down in the comments.  


It even extends beyond just clothes, although it still is directly linked with clothes, I want my \*body\* to be different as I wish as well. I want to be able to show off a modest chest and wear leggings without dealing with annoying ass tucking. But I don't hate my flat chest, and I don't hate my male bits. I want to have rounder, softer facial features, but I don't hate my more sharp ones. This all still ties directly into clothing and outfits because a lot of the things I want to be able to wear and look good in, I am physically incapable of looking good in, in the way that I want.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend always tells me that she thinks it's adorable when guys wear girls clothes, and that she thinks it's perfectly acceptable, and that's fantastic! But the issue is, I don't want to look cute because guys look cute in girls clothes, I want to look cute because this dress looks adorable.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have self confidence issues, I really don't. At the base of everything, when it's all stripped down to bear bones and brass tacks, I don't. That being said, as of this moment, and with my situation, there are things that bring out self confidence issues for me. One of those things is that I will never, ever, look the way I want in girls clothes, at least not in my current situation. And I don't feel worthless with my self confidence, if anything, I'm annoyed, I'm a little angry at it. I don't like that it happens, because it shouldn't be happening.   


Initially, when these feelings started to crop up, my immediate thought was ""Oh, I must be transgender."" But upon further delving into that, and trying that out, I figured out that I don't want to change my name, and my pronouns, or any of that, because none of that bothers me. And I also realized during that exploration, that I really just don't fit in with most of the communities of trans women that I interacted with. All of them were very gatekeeper-y, extremely hyper-feminine to a point where it felt like I was almost being pressured into giving a shit about carrying a purse, or being super into makeup, or whatever other stereotypically female things there were. I felt like I was being forced into this gender norm that almost hasn't existed since the early 2000's. I got extremely passive aggressive attitudes for mentioning the fact that I liked and played video games, D&amp;D, watched pro eSports, and other more traditionally male things. Things that nowadays, nobody would bat an eye if a cis girl liked/did, and that's when I realized that either I just wasn't trans, or I just didn't care enough about being a girl to put up with the people who were so progressive they were borderline conservative, not to pull in politics, I only use those words for lack of a better way to describe it.   


This has ended up as more of a long winded rant about my situation and experiences, but there are a few points to this whole thing, and I'd like to bring things back to them.  


Question 1, is there any, I guess label, that anyone can think of that better fits my situation. Or is there any community that would understand more of what I'm dealing with and be able to better help me.

&amp;#x200B;

Question 2, is there any way that anyone knows of here to be able to switch easily and quickly from a male presentation to a female presentation and vice versa.",genderfluid,Somewhat unique situation - Any advice?,1613379357.0,"{'created_utc': 1613354157, 'id': 'lk2xvz', 'num_comments': 6, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'To start this off, I\'ll explain this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don\'t know what I would call myself and gender fluid seems to fit the bill as best as possible.\n\nI rarely get dysphoria, it\'s only late at night when I\'m sleep deprived and wanting everything in my life to be different that I feel dysphoria.

And I also realized during that exploration, that I really just don\'t fit in with most of the communities of trans women that I interacted with. All of them were very gatekeeper-y, extremely hyper-feminine to a point where it felt like I was almost being pressured into giving a shit about carrying a purse, or being super into makeup, or whatever other stereotypically female things there were. I felt like I was being forced into this gender norm that almost hasn\'t existed since the early 2000\'s. I got extremely passive aggressive attitudes for mentioning the fact that I liked and played video games, D&amp;D, watched pro eSports, and other more traditionally male things. Things that nowadays, nobody would bat an eye if a cis girl liked/did, and that\'s when I realized that either I just wasn\'t trans, or I just didn\'t care enough about being a girl to put up with the people who were so progressive they were borderline conservative, not to pull in politics, I only use those words for lack of a better way to describe it.   \n\n\nThis has ended up as more of a long winded rant about my situation and experiences, but there are a few points to this whole thing, and I\'d like to bring things back to them.  \n\n\nQuestion 1, is there any, I guess label, that anyone can think of that better fits my situation. Or is there any community that would understand more of what I\'m dealing with and be able to better help me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuestion 2, is there any way that anyone knows of here to be able to switch easily and quickly from a male presentation to a female presentation and vice versa.', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'Somewhat unique situation - Any advice?', 'created': 1613379357.0}"

However, my dysphoria terrifies me. I am already pansexual and have internalized homophobic thoughts multiplying inside of me in fear of coming out to my Christian parents. I can’t imagine a future with anybody except a male. I am terrified to go any further with anybody else in case I can’t back out of it. It feels cowardly.

For the most part, I've never particularly identified with femininity (aside from an enjoyment of pink/preferring long hair but those don't make someone female or are even necessarily feminine traits), and whenever I was called ma'am, I don't never really corrected people in a customer service job I worked and just rolled with it as it made the interaction easier, and I always joke to people when it comes to my name ""just call me a unique identifier that isn't too offensive"".

2021-02-22 14:14:31,lpoym7,10,1,"Hi,  
I'm not even exactly sure if this is the right subreddit for what I'm about to post and I apologize if this post will get rather long.   
Ever since I was a child I had a feeling that something was different. I still can't totally ""put my finger on it"", but it's also not a constant thing that I'm feeling. Sometimes it seems to be more present than other times.   
To make it more understandable I think I have to dig a little into my past..  
I remember in elementary school I made ""bets"" with girls in my class, that I would then lose on purpose to actually do those things (e.g. grow out my nails or things like that).   
Later on, when I was like 12 and at middle school  the actual bullying started. Other students (especially guys) called me gay and a fag\*\*\*, even shouting it from far away. Why? Because I appeared different to them. I guess, I didn't exactly behave like the typical boy (playing football, being rough etc.) and they probably also didn't like that it was really easy for me to be friends with girls. Therefore I was excluded from the ""boys group"" for a few years until thingsd started slowly calming down and I was more accepted by them. What I was always sure of however, is that I'm into girls.   
During those years (age 13/14) there was also a phase where I was unsure whether I might be transgender, wanting to transition from male to female, or not - I never really had a confirmation on that and after a while that feeling kind of went away, although it resurfaced a couple of times in the later years but only for short periods of times.   
With a new wave of bullying in high school (partly for other reasons)  my self-confidence again took some major hits.

Over the past 2 years (I'm 30 now) I've slowly started discovering my female/feminine tendencies. I am interested in make-up (haven't really tried it on myself yet though) and even thought about working in that field. Also, painted my nails a couple of times.   
However, especially the last part is something I'm struggling to accept about myself. Whenever I do it I often feel ashamed/like I've done something wrong and take it off again within a few hours.   
Going outside with painted nails has not been possbile so far, because I'm too scared of what other people might think (especially if I run into people I know/that know me). A couple days ago I painted just one nail with clear polish and went for a walk outside. Whenever other people walked by me I felt the need to cover that finger with other fingers. So when I came back home I felt bad about myself again.  
 There are many things I want to try and also I just want to be ""free"" and express myself how and when I feel like it. But those experiences I made back then in school still have control over me and keep me from being me in many situations.   
So I guess my questions are:   
How can I accept myself more for liking those things and that they are a part of me? And how can I let go of those awful experiences from back then and start being the real ""me""?   


PS: tried out another color in this photo (of course only at home) and really liked how good it looked on my nails, but at the same time hated myself for liking it.

What I was always sure of however, is that I\'m into girls.   \nDuring those years (age 13/14) there was also a phase where I was unsure whether I might be transgender, wanting to transition from male to female, or not - I never really had a confirmation on that and after a while that feeling kind of went away, although it resurfaced a couple of times in the later years but only for short periods of times.   \nWith a new wave of bullying in high school (partly for other reasons)  my self-confidence again took some major hits.\n\nOver the past 2 years (I\'m 30 now) I\'ve slowly started discovering my female/feminine tendencies. I am interested in make-up (haven\'t really tried it on myself yet though) and even thought about working in that field. Also, painted my nails a couple of times.   \nHowever, especially the last part is something I\'m struggling to accept about myself. Whenever I do it I often feel ashamed/like I\'ve done something wrong and take it off again within a few hours.   \nGoing outside with painted nails has not been possbile so far, because I\'m too scared of what other people might think (especially if I run into people I know/that know me). A couple days ago I painted just one nail with clear polish and went for a walk outside. Whenever other people walked by me I felt the need to cover that finger with other fingers. So when I came back home I felt bad about myself again.  \n There are many things I want to try and also I just want to be ""free"" and express myself how and when I feel like it. But those experiences I made back then in school still have control over me and keep me from being me in many situations.   \nSo I guess my questions are:   \nHow can I accept myself more for liking those things and that they are a part of me? And how can I let go of those awful experiences from back then and start being the real ""me""?   \n\n\nPS: tried out another color in this photo (of course only at home) and really liked how good it looked on my nails, but at the same time hated myself for liking it.   \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x2grncase1j61.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3434a82cd82c7a4d669762cabd8ac32d5460716a', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'How to overcome ""struggles""/ accept yourself?', 'created': 1614028471.0}"

Does this make any sense? And does anyone else relate/ have any insights into this? Tysm ! :)

Honestly, whenever these topics come up my blood start to boil.
Most of the time I try to keep quiet because I don't want to cause an argument and I don't want to be judged.
But sometimes I can't help it and, without being rude or patronising, I try and explain how genders really work.

I would expect them to at least give me some respect as I am a sociologist and gender fluidity is one of the things I fight for. But it just seems like whenever I try and give an actual intellectual opinion they just sort of look away and don't say anything, or just nodd.

Honestly, it is so hard to deal with their crazy conservative opinions but I also don't want create problems in the family as it is my family in law.

Has anyone got any tips on how I deal with these contrasting opinions?

We are interested in understanding how stressful life events impact transgender and gender diverse (TGD) people. If you identify as TGD and have recently experienced a very stressful event, you might be eligible to participate in this research study. 

The purpose of this research is to promote trauma recovery for trans and gender diverse people by better understanding how discrimination blocks pathways to healing.

Participation in this study involves the completion of 4 interview appointments scheduled over 12 months. During each appointment, you will be asked to participate in a clinical interview, provide salivary samples, and complete several questionnaires. For 14 days following these appointments, you will receive a link each day prompting you to complete a brief questionnaire. Eligible participants may earn up to $360 for study activities.

If you are interested in participating, please complete this online screening survey: [https://tinyurl.com/y4pac7mw](https://tinyurl.com/y4pac7mw)
