2021-04-01 22:12:44,mi6e30,0,1,"I know that it has probably been said many times before me, but I think the point need to hit home still. I myself am not bothered by the topic of this post, simply because I think that the opinions of others are irrelevant as long as I am happy. However, I have come to the conclusion that I need to use that to my advantage. The problem doesn't affect me, so I'm going to use my freedom to make sure it can no longer affect the people I care about, and everybody else that gender inequality hurts.

Now one main thing that seems to be forgotten by quite a few people is this: women are not the only ones that aren't treated as equals! There are transgender men, transgender women, folk that are non-binary, and any other gender that can possibly be imagined, and all of them suffer from the injustice to them because of their gender. Even, as much as some would loathe to admit it, men can be impacted by the inequality.

Being a member of the younger generation myself, I may not be the most intellectual person to be listening too, but if you decided that you saw reason to what I was saying, you will still listen to what I have to say.

Last week, an individual at my school expressed that he would like to wear a skirt during the club set up as a support for members of the LGBTQ+ community. As the supportive group we are, we applauded his confidence and choice to do what he felt was comfortable.

However the cheer couldn't last for long.

He then went on to explain how, when asking a member of staff if it would be according to the uniform for him to wear a skirt (something he shouldn't have felt required to do in the first place), he was told it was not allowed. This caused some outrage among our group, as we felt this was incredibly wrong, especially in a school that was supposed to be supportive of the community.

On further investigation, it was found that the uniform is not gendered for that exact reason, and he was well within his right to wear a skirt if he so wished, and that even the Headmistress was fully supportive should a boy decide to wear a skirt. But this one teacher had told him he wasn't allowed.

Another example is one from my own experience. Recently, we have been studying the play 'An Inspector Calls', written in 1945 by J.B.Priestley. I had also watched a movie on Netflix called 'Moxie', which was focused on girl-power and fighting the male-dominant power in their school. Both made me focus more on the slight things people do that are different with boys or girls. Not anything major in school, but more of a sub-conscience decision that women are weaker.

During a game of basketball at a club I attended, where I was the only girl, I noticed that I was always on the larger team (it was a odd number of attendees). Now whether that be done intentionally, due to my shorter-than-the-rest height or my gender, or whether it was just a complete coincidence, I do not know. However, it was such a fine detail it would go unnoticed by most unless they were looking for any sign that there was differing treatment, something I had sub-conscientiously been doing since the theme of gender inequality arose during our analysis of 'An Inspector Calls.'

Whilst this may seem insignificant to most, it could be a real game-changer to others. Unfortunately, I don't have any other stories as of yet that could show how the many other genders suffer, but if you would like to share, please feel free too.

I myself am not bothered by the topic of this post, simply because I think that the opinions of others are irrelevant as long as I am happy. However, I have come to the conclusion that I need to use that to my advantage. The problem doesn't affect me, so I'm going to use my freedom to make sure it can no longer affect the people I care about, and everybody else that gender inequality hurts.\n\nNow one main thing that seems to be forgotten by quite a few people is this: women are not the only ones that aren't treated as equals! There are transgender men, transgender women, folk that are non-binary, and any other gender that can possibly be imagined, and all of them suffer from the injustice to them because of their gender. Even, as much as some would loathe to admit it, men can be impacted by the inequality.\n\nBeing a member of the younger generation myself, I may not be the most intellectual person to be listening too, but if you decided that you saw reason to what I was saying, you will still listen to what I have to say.\n\nLast week, an individual at my school expressed that he would like to wear a skirt during the club set up as a support for members of the LGBTQ+ community. As the supportive group we are, we applauded his confidence and choice to do what he felt was comfortable.\n\nHowever the cheer couldn't last for long.\n\nHe then went on to explain how, when asking a member of staff if it would be according to the uniform for him to wear a skirt (something he shouldn't have felt required to do in the first place), he was told it was not allowed. This caused some outrage among our group, as we felt this was incredibly wrong, especially in a school that was supposed to be supportive of the community.\n\nOn further investigation, it was found that the uniform is not gendered for that exact reason, and he was well within his right to wear a skirt if he so wished, and that even the Headmistress was fully supportive should a boy decide to wear a skirt. But this one teacher had told him he wasn't allowed.\n\nAnother example is one from my own experience. Recently, we have been studying the play 'An Inspector Calls', written in 1945 by J.B.Priestley. I had also watched a movie on Netflix called 'Moxie', which was focused on girl-power and fighting the male-dominant power in their school. Both made me focus more on the slight things people do that are different with boys or girls. Not anything major in school, but more of a sub-conscience decision that women are weaker.\n\nDuring a game of basketball at a club I attended, where I was the only girl, I noticed that I was always on the larger team (it was a odd number of attendees). Now whether that be done intentionally, due to my shorter-than-the-rest height or my gender, or whether it was just a complete coincidence, I do not know. However, it was such a fine detail it would go unnoticed by most unless they were looking for any sign that there was differing treatment, something I had sub-conscientiously been doing since the theme of gender inequality arose during our analysis of 'An Inspector Calls.'\n\nWhilst this may seem insignificant to most, it could be a real game-changer to others. Unfortunately, I don't have any other stories as of yet that could show how the many other genders suffer, but if you would like to share, please feel free too. By showing what is wrong, maybe we can finally make a right in the world, and that small difference could make a huge difference for somebody 10 years from now if we can build a solid tolerance, at the very least.\n\nIf you have any stories that you would like me to share on your behalf, and make it known without sabotaging you anonymity, please feel free to tell me.

2021-04-03 05:50:21,mj2h45,1,1,"sexism/sexist: hard to define? 

Anytime someone makes a judgment based on your gender? What if you want others to treat you a certain way based on your gender?

What if you don't have a gender?

Narrative: Sexism/Being sexist is very real and very hurtful.  Has been since forever. Gradual change has arguably allowed for this to diminish to some degree overtime, however it still exists. 

When certain genders have been oppressed, said genders might want to speak up and say something about this.  They also might want to feel empowered and identify with their same gender and have unity with said gender.  This could lead to said gender wanting to be proud of their gender and possibly make acknowledgments of their strength as a certain gender.  They might also express their gender is capable of greatness and superior to other genders and will dominate other genders. 

Those genders being oppressed might want to be treated not fairly, nor equally, but rather privileged and in a position where their oppression has caused them to unite with others of the same type that are being oppressed.  

What happens when a certain gender is wanting to feel empowerment by specifically calling out their greatness because of their gender? They feel their gender is great and their traits are great because they are said gender.  They feel their gender can achieve greatness and their gender can perform and make progress, arguably better than other genders. 

Is it not a perfectly reasonable reaction to being oppressed? To want to have pride in one's gender and take the future by storm with their gender? What if said gender wants to be treated a certain way because of their gender?

When oppression exists, it's a common occurrence for others to be allies with those who are oppressed and want to help and assist others.  When a certain gender is being oppressed and want to do something about it and admits to others of their superior traits based off of their gender, do their allies support them? 

When progress occurs to change a concept, along with it parallel concepts are changed as well. 

What if others are being oppressed as well? What is someone doesn't identify with the gender that is doing the oppressing, nor the gender that is being oppressed? Do allies regardless of gender stand beside the oppressed genders in solidarity? 

What if one doesn't have a gender? Do they stand in solidarity and acknowledge the oppression and  course of action, or do they address a bias of gender is occurring? Do the genderless have a juxtaposition in this situation?  Should the empowered gender continue to promote their gendered traits, while the genderless may not or may feel oppressed themselves?

I have always been andro, AFAB, I have been asked why I’m using ladies toilets before, people calling me sir, then I speak and they go oh .. sorry .. and I have never had a problem with that. To be honest I love confusing people with my gender !! It’s fun, and they get properly freak out.. I do wear gender neutral clothes too, so it’s making identifying me even more difficult. 
Recently I have started to question my gender fluidity too, I prefer males clothes, partly because I am a female and it’s all exciting, I hardly ever go proper femme, because me in dress just feels all sorts of wrong. I don’t really go by labels, because they don’t really matter to me, but for others: I know I am pan, poly, andro ... but I am gender fluid too ?? 🤔 I wear woman shirts and tight trousers, wearing a dress and skirts are a no no ... so am I gender fluid ?? I just for all of this interesting ... there is a girl who loves me and she doesn’t care who I am .. she takes me as a F/M  what ever I feel like .. question is: is this gender fluid ???
