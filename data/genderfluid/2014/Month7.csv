I can already see the red flags going up in your heads.


Correction: The side of the family that I live with is very religious. I recently came to terms with my pangender identity, and my father and stepmother could not be more okay with that. Unfortunately, they live halfway across the country from me. My parents divorced about 8 or 9 years ago in Oklahoma, U.S.A., and my mother got custody because of some rare bizarre freak storm of total assholes in the legal system. These assholes also somehow managed to get into the health care system and all the places my dad tried to find work, and eight months ago, tired of getting repeatedly screwed over by random strangers, he moved to Washington state, where he is now kicking ass (but not as much financially, so we don't know if a legal attempt to take custody is an excellent idea, because my mother's family - we'll call them the Millers - has money out the asshole. I'll let you enjoy that mental picture.)


My mother is not very comfortable with the idea of me being androgynous, and by that I mean she totally flipped her shit when I first told her. My tendency towards feminine clothing alone sets her on edge, and she's definitely not going to change the pronouns she uses. She has me go to a counselor to talk about my gender (among other things, but she started making appointments when I came out to her). I'm not even going to talk about my dudebro stepfather.


I have plenty of other friends that accept me for who I am, and I haven't seen a single one of them for eight months. My mother outright forbids me from visiting my adult friends, and somehow something always comes in the way of me visiting my peers. Instead, my mother opts to take me (on those rare occasions when I don't stay home alone, bored, and lonely for about 9 waking hours a day) to see - guess who? - my very religious family members. None of whom accept me for who I am. I have no computer (they took it away), no cell phone (never had one in the first place), nothin'. I'm typing this on my 3DS, which is actually a huge pain in the ass, and it's really hard to vent. All I have is a house phone, and not only do I only have the phone numbers of my dad and one very religious friend, I definitely do not put it past the Millers to be recording my conversations (and if you think that's crazy, you don't know the Millers).


They took my computer away because A) I'm genderqueer and my potentially queer actions on the internet frighten them, and B) They were made even more suspicious of potentially queer actions when I watched Ouran High School Host Club on Netflix. Oh yeah, they turned Netflix off too.


I want to just go to live with my dad, but the Millers are about as okay with that as me wearing dresses. My mother is suspicious of their ""living situation"", because they work and live in a hostal, and my mother isn't comfortable with the idea of me being around reportedly awesome strangers on a regular basis. She is also suspicious that I won't attend high school, since my dad kicks ass at homeschooling and was probably a better teacher for me than most of the ones at my school (not because they are all bad teachers, but because they have to teach 30+ kids at once, whereas he only has to teach one). However, I have no objection to going to school in Washington, not to mention the fact that none of my ideal career choices (read: career choices I would ever consider choosing because I'll be damned if I'm going to spend half of every weekday doing something I don't enjoy) require a diploma or degree. Mom's argument against this is being suspicious of the quality of public education in Washington.


I'm more venting than asking for advice, but any that you might have to give is very welcome.

It's been about a year and a half since I started to understand myself as specifically ""not male"". I first became aware of trans issues maybe five or six years ago but I never once considered – or allowed myself to consider – that any of the stuff I was educating myself on could be of any direct relevance to me. At some point I realised I had never actually asked myself, ""is it possible that I'm transgender?"". Short and incredibly reductionist version: I did exactly that, and I concluded that I was not ""a man"", and that that was OK. I also realised that I didn't want to identify myself as female instead of male. I became aware that I felt like I didn't belong in either of those categories, and I allowed myself to accept that it was OK to feel that way.

I grew up feeling all kinds of weird and bad ways about myself that I didn't have the experience or language to deal with constructively. I didn't factor any of it into gender stuff at the time. And for the most part I filed those feelings away and figured that feeling as though I didn't ""fit"" – both within myself, and the social contexts I moved in – was just run-of-the-mill existential angst. When I started being honest to myself about who and how I was, those feelings practically evaporated. And I've been doing a lot of thinking about what that means. For most of the time since the day I accepted myself as nonbinary, I've been telling myself ""I don't experience dysphoria"". While frequently having days when I'm so desperate to be more femme that it hurts. I'm generally OK with my body. I have zero issues with my junk. Despite not having to work through a ""wrong body"" narrative, I figure what I grew up feeling was a kind of dysphoria – nonspecific, and without direction, and without context. The times I feel dysphoric today are definitely rooted in a feeling of missing something, but at least now I have an idea of what I'm actually missing.

I'm still at a point where I'm just barely beginning to introduce changes to my presentation that I'm desperate to implement. And I know I'm still young, and I know there's no such thing as ""it's too late!"" in any of this. But I see people in their teens and younger who've grown up with access to these ideas, and they're out to their families and communities, and they get to approach adulthood while having far better a grasp on who they are than I could have ever dreamed of having during my adolescence. I don't buy into ""born this way"" and I don't even care if that's how it works; the etiology of my gender is totally irrelevant. I do know, though, that if I'd had the tiniest bit of awareness of the how and why of gender at, say, age 10, I would have rolled with it. I would've matured as a version of myself not desperately trying (and failing) to pass as just another ""boy"". I wish my parents had known the things I know.

We're all in this together, and each of our struggles is unique, but I'm still working past being jealous of those I perceive as having it better than me even though I consciously know those things and act on them.

9,2014-07-02 17:23:36,29nyx1,6,2,"Hello fellow beautiful genderqueers,

Been lurking a while and did a search, but didn't find quite what I was looking for. I'm moving cross-country for a new job, which is really exciting. It's a progressive workplace, very clearly cool with LGBT issues, but when I interviewed for the job, I was dressed very gender-normatively, based on recommendations from friends and family. I'm DFAB, so that meant I wore makeup and heels, something I literally never do in my personal life. I don't hate she/her pronouns, or my birth name (though I wouldn't mind switching to they/them or ze/hir at some point, and going by a more gender neutral name). Honestly anyone who saw me would probably never guess I had gender issues. I often wear dresses and sneakers, and keep my hair very short. I don't bind my breasts or act ""masculine"" per se. I guess I just don't think performing ""masculine"" dress or behavior actually indicates my gender. Why can't I be a boy who wears a dress, likes ""girly"" television shows, etc? I honestly think if it were acceptable, a huge amount of cis males would wear dresses, because it is so much easier than going through the trouble of putting on pants and a t-shirt. Especially as a slightly chubby person with big boobs, finding a dress that fits is soooo much easier than finding pants and shirts that fit.

Anyway, after all that background, here's my problem: I really, really don't want to wear makeup at work. I have nice boy shoes, some comfortable suits, and can definitely look super professional and put-together in my androgynous mode. But my job is sales-oriented, and I'm definitely the face of my organization. Does that mean my face needs to wear makeup? Should I just try to go without it and see if anyone complains? It's a great job and I don't want to sabotage it, but I also really, really don't want to wear makeup. I don't feel comfortable in it, I don't feel confident.

I\'m moving cross-country for a new job, which is really exciting. It\'s a progressive workplace, very clearly cool with LGBT issues, but when I interviewed for the job, I was dressed very gender-normatively, based on recommendations from friends and family. I\'m DFAB, so that meant I wore makeup and heels, something I literally never do in my personal life. I don\'t hate she/her pronouns, or my birth name (though I wouldn\'t mind switching to they/them or ze/hir at some point, and going by a more gender neutral name). Honestly anyone who saw me would probably never guess I had gender issues. I often wear dresses and sneakers, and keep my hair very short. I don\'t bind my breasts or act ""masculine"" per se. I guess I just don\'t think performing ""masculine"" dress or behavior actually indicates my gender. Why can\'t I be a boy who wears a dress, likes ""girly"" television shows, etc? I honestly think if it were acceptable, a huge amount of cis males would wear dresses, because it is so much easier than going through the trouble of putting on pants and a t-shirt. Especially as a slightly chubby person with big boobs, finding a dress that fits is soooo much easier than finding pants and shirts that fit.\n\nAnyway, after all that background, here\'s my problem: I really, really don\'t want to wear makeup at work. I have nice boy shoes, some comfortable suits, and can definitely look super professional and put-together in my androgynous mode. But my job is sales-oriented, and I\'m definitely the face of my organization. Does that mean my face needs to wear makeup? Should I just try to go without it and see if anyone complains? It\'s a great job and I don\'t want to sabotage it, but I also really, really don\'t want to wear makeup. I don\'t feel comfortable in it, I don\'t feel confident.

I'm nonbinary but go mostly by she/her pronouns.

I also happen to be very small (5'2"" and 90 lbs). This means I have a hard time finding clothes that fit, because I am trying to present less feminine.

Where I go:

1. So far, my best go-to resource is Topman. They have a rotating set of sales online. I especially like their t-shirts and button-downs. The XXS shirts fit me very well, as long as they are of thin material (I have a couple of shirts of thicker material that look way too big because they shrink less). When their stuff isn't on sale, though, it's way too pricy.

2. Old Navy. Some of their women's button downs actually look acceptably neutral if you bind, and their prices are typically reasonable.

3. Goodwill for genderqueers on a budget. All of the clothes have been washed like 800 times, so they shrink a lot. I've found a lot of good men's clothes from one of the Goodwills in my state.

4. Online Asian clothing stores like Trendykey and TheLees. I haven't bought anything yet, but I have a few options open in tabs from stores I found on Amazon. They actually get bad reviews because American guys try to buy their clothes and their sizes run so small.

5. All of my binders are from Underworks. Make sure you buy a size up of your usual size--I have a couple of XS binders and I always get horrible heartburn when I wear them.

6. H&amp;M. I have some shirts from the young boys' section, and their suspenders are great. Also some of their women's shirts are cut more neutrally. Their pants also go waist x length instead of by size, which is helpful.

If anyone has any other resources for tiny people, please let me know. Now that I've accepted my gender as non-cis, I'm like obsessed with my appearance and I enjoy presenting nonbinary about half the time, so I want to find more clothes I can do that with.

I said one thing would be to grow my hair to a more androgynous length but *instantly* she said I can't because my ""hair grows out and all bushy on top so it is not possible to grow it down"" at all! - bitch, I get the impression, even though she's never said, that she doesn't like be being trans*!

Using male/female based on chromosomes and masculine/feminine for gender feels completely absurd to me. A man can be feminine and a woman can be masculine. How masculine or feminine you are doesn't really matter to what gender you identify as to me.

As her story progresses, she also begins hormone replacement therapy, and while her transition is not a main focus of the plot, the Male -&gt; Female transition parallels other ways that her character grows, including her  Soldier -&gt; Hero shift.

I come to Reddit to ask for help on how to accurately write and draw Nora's transition.

49,2014-07-10 19:00:54,2acu4r,20,7,"First of all, I apologize for the rambling post. 

As a little background, I identify as transmasculine/genderqueer. I like to wear some things on occasion that are traditionally female (dresses, makeup) but I don't feel that I am female. I don't have plans to take T currently, namely because male pattern baldness runs in my family. I want to look more masculine, but I'm also not sure that I want to live full time as a man yet or ever. I don't relate to having a female body and have intense dysphoria about my breasts and occasionally my vagina, but I don't particularly want to go bald, or have facial hair, or undergo surgery other than top surgery. My current goal has been to lose weight and build muscle and have a more androgynous appearance.

I'm starting grad school in the fall and another user on here mentioned asking my classmates and professors to call me by my preferred name off the bat, or it'll be difficult to get them to change once they've gotten used to my birth name. I don't have a huge problem with my birth name, but it's a name that's exclusively female and there's no male equivalent. I think I've settled on a male name - Siegfried (I study German language/history so I felt that it was a good fit for me) or Sig/Sigi (said like Zig/Ziggy) as a nickname. My birth name also starts with S, and the nickname for it is a name more typically used for kids, and I feel like the nickname ""Sigi"" has the same playful kind of sound as my birth name nickname.

The only issue is, if I ask people to call me Siegfried, then it'll out me immediately, and I'm not sure I want to draw attention to myself like that as soon as I start a new school. Sigi is a little more gender neutral - it can be a nickname for Sigrid (a female name) as well - but pretty uncommon in the US. I'm going to grad school for German history, so it's likely most of my professors and my classmates will be familiar with the name.

I can't really pass as a man currently, nor am I sure I really want to. I don't want to feel ashamed or weird for wearing makeup or dresses once in a while. I also don't want to feel like to express the male part of myself, I have to hide the feminine things that I like. But pretending to be a ciswoman doesn't really work for me either because that's not who I am.

So my question is, what is your advice? Do you think it would be a big deal to ask my professors to call me by a male name if I don't plan on presenting full-time as a male? I've thought about picking a more common gender neutral name, but nothing really appeals to me because I really do like Sigi and I feel that it represents me better than Sam or something.",genderqueer,Deciding on a name and questions about going by a different name,1405044054.0,"{'created_utc': 1405018854, 'id': '2acu4r', 'num_comments': 20, 'score': 7, 'selftext': 'First of all, I apologize for the rambling post. \n\nAs a little background, I identify as transmasculine/genderqueer.

My birth name also starts with S, and the nickname for it is a name more typically used for kids, and I feel like the nickname ""Sigi"" has the same playful kind of sound as my birth name nickname.\n\nThe only issue is, if I ask people to call me Siegfried, then it\'ll out me immediately, and I\'m not sure I want to draw attention to myself like that as soon as I start a new school. Sigi is a little more gender neutral - it can be a nickname for Sigrid (a female name) as well - but pretty uncommon in the US. I\'m going to grad school for German history, so it\'s likely most of my professors and my classmates will be familiar with the name.\n\nI can\'t really pass as a man currently, nor am I sure I really want to. I don\'t want to feel ashamed or weird for wearing makeup or dresses once in a while. I also don\'t want to feel like to express the male part of myself, I have to hide the feminine things that I like. But pretending to be a ciswoman doesn\'t really work for me either because that\'s not who I am.\n\nSo my question is, what is your advice? Do you think it would be a big deal to ask my professors to call me by a male name if I don\'t plan on presenting full-time as a male? I\'ve thought about picking a more common gender neutral name, but nothing really appeals to me because I really do like Sigi and I feel that it represents me better than Sam or something.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Deciding on a name and questions about going by a different name', 'created': 1405044054.0}"

I can barely afford to have razors to keep shaving my face and that's a nightmare in itself. Anyway, I've struggled with schizophrenia/multiple personality disorder (not sure what the difference is or which one I specifically have). When I was 21 I felt like a woman and expressed it, and no one accepted it, called me confused. Now I'm 27, I realized quite awhile ago that all the little personas I've made for myself are female and I'm not happy as a male at all. I'm a bit of a religious/spiritual person and I've lost both of my brothers but I don't even blame God for that, but for this I'm just, I don't get it. I'm completely scared out of my mind because my father has expressed to me many times that he thinks homosexuality (or anything like it) is wrong. He's told me he couldn't even stand having gay neighbors, it would almost be easier if I was just gay or something, I don't know how anyone is going to react when their son/cousin/brother/uncle wants to be known as a female. On top of it all, I literally have no one to talk to about it that can relate to it. I have no gay, bi or trans friends or family. Well, maybe bi, but no one is admitting it. I now I have to come out and I'm 100% positive I want to be a woman more than anything, but my options are extremely limited and I don't want to give away too much personal information, but I live in Ontario where the suicide rate for trans people is ridiculously high (I'm not suicidal though, just extremely depressed an anxious about coming out). In regards to the schizophrenia, most of my symptoms have stopped since I realized that I'm trans. I just don't know what to do. I'm terrified.

But again, I'm extremely afraid of how my family will react and like, what kind of trans I am; if I'm going to work as a male and just dress up when I go out or hang at home; if doing THAT is going to just make me stick to different personalities (I'd rather be a full-time female).

I don't want to lose friends, most of my friends are straight males but I always get along with the women I know so much better, in fact I fit right in with the women and I get flak from the men because of it.

Financially when it comes to transitioning, I'm fucked. I can barely afford to have razors to keep shaving my face and that's a nightmare in itself. Anyway, I've struggled with schizophrenia/multiple personality disorder (not sure what the difference is or which one I specifically have). When I was 21 I felt like a woman and expressed it, and no one accepted it, called me confused. Now I'm 27, I realized quite awhile ago that all the little personas I've made for myself are female and I'm not happy as a male at all. I'm a bit of a religious/spiritual person and I've lost both of my brothers but I don't even blame God for that, but for this I'm just, I don't get it. I'm completely scared out of my mind because my father has expressed to me many times that he thinks homosexuality (or anything like it) is wrong. He's told me he couldn't even stand having gay neighbors, it would almost be easier if I was just gay or something, I don't know how anyone is going to react when their son/cousin/brother/uncle wants to be known as a female. On top of it all, I literally have no one to talk to about it that can relate to it. I have no gay, bi or trans friends or family. Well, maybe bi, but no one is admitting it. I now I have to come out and I'm 100% positive I want to be a woman more than anything, but my options are extremely limited and I don't want to give away too much personal information, but I live in Ontario where the suicide rate for trans people is ridiculously high (I'm not suicidal though, just extremely depressed an anxious about coming out).

I grew up (and now live in) a highly conservative environment, and I am fairly isolated from the trans* community and from people in general. For years I had nothing but (sadly common) misconceptions about the word ""transgender"", and wasn't even aware of non-binary/genderqueer gender identities until I began doing serious research on the subject over the past year and a half or so. Suddenly, a lot of things are starting to ""click"" for me. I'm now starting to form an entirely different way to approach gender, and humanity in general; as well as a feeling of validation that there is actually a community filled with people who may share my feelings and acknowledge my identity. 

I'm a 23 year old AMAB person who has been ""struggling"" with gender for literally as long as I can remember. Even as a very young child I was confused as to why being a ""boy"" excluded me from doing certain things I wanted to do; and later, frustrated to the point of despair that I was actively being repressed from being able to express myself. My feelings of shame, fear, and what I know now as dysphoria, led me into juvenile delinquency, and a high-risk lifestyle. I was willing to take what I thought was acceptance from anyone, and abused drugs and alcohol in a suicidal fashion until I became a parent almost three years ago. Now that the dust of my early youth has settled, and there has been some calm in my life, I've started what I think of as a true awakening to myself. I'm now getting ready to take the next step, and reach out to others. Now that I'm figuring out who I am, I want to be connected to the world in a way that feels true and honest. 

I've started to identify myself as Genderqueer, but beyond that I'm not sure what other terms I would identify myself with. What I do know, is that I don't feel like a ""man"". Adhering to the ""man"" archetype was something I always felt difficulty in doing. It never came naturally. It was something I was taught. I tend to go from periods of feeling unbiased about my gender, to periods of acute dysphoria and longing to be female. It sort of comes in waves, and if I have triggers, I haven't been able to identify them yet. I am still presenting publicly as male (especially at work), and am trying to introduce more androgyny into my daily presentation steps-by-step. I'm making progress on gaining the confidence to express my gender openly.

The only person I've talked to about this is my girlfriend (and best friend for nearly a decade :D), and after a short time of confusion, she's become exceedingly supportive and accepting of me - despite my grim expectations. She's certainly been the source of a lot of my momentum in all aspects of life. My almost 3-year old son deserves my honesty, and I have made no attempt to hide my identity from him. He makes very few distinctions regarding the way I present myself, and the distinctions he does make are positive.

Now, as I've said, I think I'm ready to reach out to other people, and I could use some advice on some things.

I'm trying to think of a way to ""come out"" to friends and family members, but I don't think I'm truly prepared to answer a volley of questions. Does anybody have suggestions on how to educate people about non-binary gender identities?

I want to be involved in the trans* community, and human rights activism. I'm a passionate feminist, but speaking out against sexism and discrimination exclusively among co-workers and acquaintances doesn't feel like enough. Which online/offline communities would you recommend I contact? What organizations should I look into?

Lastly, I've been thinking about going to see a counselor/doctor who specializes in helping people like me. Any advice on finding a good counselor in the state of Indiana?

Is this true??? I live in Denver, btw, and I can't find such a thing. but of course, it's hard to dig through all the laws. I know they have to provide neutral bathrooms, but i can't find anything else.

Besides going backpacking with my friends and my girlfriend occasionally I lead an incredibly vanilla lifestyle. Recently it has become a bit of a hobby (obsession?) of mine to come into these niche, under-recognized areas of the web and hangout with you interesting people, because I lead a well accepted life style and it's interesting for me to hear from people who are a little less advantaged.

Generally, I try to be accepting of others (as everyone should) whether or not I even understand why they do what they do, unless it of course negatively impacts others. This sub though... is... uh.

If you could give me a hand here and provide some responses to my.... er, poll, it would be greatly appreciated! My questions, mainly, are these:
 
1)    How old were you when you began struggling to ascertain your identity in a gender-binary society?

2)     Where does your drive in life come from? Surely it would be easier to assimilate and assume an identity that you don't necessarily agree with for simplicities sake?

3)      How often and in what ways do you feel discriminated against?

4)       Why is that so many of you feel the need to express yourself through your (arguably extreme) fashion choices? This undoubtedly leads to people prejudging you, so why bother?

5)        How has your family reacted?

6)        How has your love life been impacted? In this neck of the wood, it seems like they aren't many fish in the sea.

81,2014-07-17 20:17:06,2azh3z,7,10,"Hey. I'm really seriously new at this, so forgive me if I ramble a bit. (added midway through:) In fact, I just realized I am rambling a bit, so I'll put a TL;DR at the bottom. Sorry.

I've known I was... something ""else""... since I was a kid, even if I didn't begin to understand what or how to express it. I went back and forth on whether I liked being a ""girl"", which drove my mother to frustration. I had imaginary friends that were male. I started drawing pictures when I was six of a boy who was just like me except he did all the things I wanted to do but couldn't. (I told my mother and teachers he was my imaginary boyfriend because I was convinced I was supposed to have those.) When I was eight, my mother started pushing hard for me to act more like a girl, even encouraging me to enter in a Young Miss beauty contest at one point, but it never took. Bear in mind, I wanted to be normal. I wore dresses for special occasions (albeit under protest), tried to keep up with my hair, played at having little kid boyfriends, even managed to look sideways at my baby sisters' play makeup stand, though I couldn't bring myself to actually wear the stuff. It never felt completely right.

Puberty made everything more pronounced, especially since I apparently hit the ""genetic jackpot"". I got very hourglass-y, my tits came out fast and huge (US size 6 figure with DD cups by the time I was sixteen), and my already relatively high singing voice soared so far into soprano range I could have gone operatic if I wanted. All of which I was clueless about until years later, but I absolutely noticed how people treated me and expected me to dress and behave. I explained away my inability to fully pull this off by joking about growing up with a ""70% male brain"", knowing no one would take that seriously. When I was fourteen, I realized the boy I kept drawing looked like me for a reason, and I freaked out and told my parents I'd had a psychotic episode. I worked even harder trying to be normal, to the point of severe overcompensating, even while everything in me fought against it and knew what I was doing to myself was wrong. I wanted to fit, and I convinced myself that the ""fake it 'til you make it"" approach was the only way that was going to happen.

As time went by (and my efforts to pretend to be normal got more self-destructive), I tried various, ""more acceptable"" forms of coming out, but I was met with blanket identity denial (even from the Gay Straight Alliance I tried to join in high school when I was trying being bi instead of straight as I didn't know what asexual was), accusations of being in a ""phase"", No True Scotsman arguments, and various forms of freaking out from my friends, exes, significant others, and parents. All of these resulted in my running back into the closet so hard I became a caricature of a ditsy, slutty, bisexual cis just to convince them (and myself) that I was being randomly crazy and it wasn't real. All the while, I kept having gender-bending dreams, mild to moderate issues with the way I felt not matching the mirror, and various other communications from my subconscious that the labels I kept attaching to myself were wildly inaccurate.

When I was 23, I finally started acknowledging that the days when I woke up with what I termed ""phantom dick syndrome"" and the times when I suddenly, physically felt like my tits and hips weren't actually part of my body were not the passing fantasies of a crazy person. I'd been collecting friends and associations in the LGBTQ community for a few years, so I knew what genderqueer was, but I still wasn't ready to actually do something about it. I knew I wasn't trans since I wasn't like this all the time, so I figured I could just ignore it and be fine. Except I wasn't. Even in my ignoring, it had been coming out for years. I bought fedoras. I cut my hair. I developed a minor obsession with button down shirts. I learned how to wear a tie. I researched breast binding, and then cried because my I-cups couldn't be corralled. I raged against the very concept of a ""pantsuit"" on the grounds of gender conformity. I lusted after Matt Bomer's wardrobe in White Collar. I bitched about women's shoes being more form than function while wearing men's shoes hurt my feet. I fell in love with the webcomic El Goonish Shive and wished Tedd's TF gun could be real. I tried to make my voice lower, virtually destroying my singing voice in the process, and internally bitched whenever I caught myself speaking in my higher tones. And I fought, denied, and handwaved every single bit of it whenever someone pointed out that my closet was gaining transparency.

Last November, I moved to Salt Lake City to get away from my midwest baggage and start over. Problem was, I still couldn't cope with expressing my gender identity and refused to even acknowledge my asexuality. Until I made friends with the first person in my life who saw right through me and called my bullshit for what it was. He all but forced me to confront my asexuality, for which I will always thank him, and helped me realize it wasn't a shortcoming or a romantic death sentence. It's just me, and that was ok. I'm fairly certain he knows about the genderqueer/andro/genderfluid thing, too, even though I'm just in the last 24 hours deciding to accept and act on that one, largely due to a combination of his repeatedly telling me ""Just be who you are"" and my roommate being phenomenally supportive when I effectively broke down in his doorway last night.

So, here I am. I'm 27, asexual, gender... something..., and worn out from a lifetime of lies and denial. I'm terrified how my family is going to react. I'm daunted by the amount of weight I have to lose and muscle I have to build so I can get my breast reduction and start to look like myself. I still have bits in my head of my own making pressuring me to feminize. In spite of this, and the challenges I know I'll face thanks to genetics, I'm ready to stop trying and just be myself. To misquote Fall Out Boy, I'm ready to change like a remix and rise like a phoenix. To that end, I've followed the advice of my roommate and come here to share my story and find people who both understand and will be willing to help me deal with the hard parts, like my voice and my hips and getting people not to be weirded out because my gender expression changes with the wind. And my parents. Holy cow my parents...

91,2014-07-21 23:33:18,2bce5f,14,4,"Hey Reddit,

As the title says, I've had a bit more than a little wondering exactly what I am. I'm biologically male, but not entirely happy with it. Not entirely unhappy with it, either. 

Some days, being a dude is great. I like all the convenient bits, like peeing standing up and being able to kiss and sex ladies without being judged for it, and PIV is pretty great from my standpoint. Admittedly, I'm not the most experienced guy out there by any means. But if any of my lady friends were down for bonin', I would say hell yes. Additionally, I like being so naturally strong and big most days. Put that together with my goofy personality and I just feel and act like a big cuddly teddy bear. Moustaches and beards are cool as hell, haha. 

On the other hand, some days I just couldn't feel more wrong about the situation. I want to wear a dress, a miniskirt, or a bikini and go out in public. And not in drag. I know men who could pass as women pretty easily, and me? No way in hell. I'm broad shouldered, muscled, and while I like my beard and moustache most days, I grow visible stubble in ~2 hours after shaving. Trying to go around convincingly would be a nightmare. When I fantasize about putting myself on display like that, it would definitely be as a completely different person. There's the sexual desires too. I don't know if it's strange, but as a man I don't think I'd be up for more than kissing other men. But as a woman... both when I've watched and performed acts like PIV or eating a woman out, as much as I've enjoyed it personally I've always though *godDAMN* that looks fun. I'm also, I think, a pretty big sub. I know that isn't dependent on gender, but most women expect men to be the initiator in most parts of the relationship, sexual or otherwise. I would really have liked the opportunity to try sexual acts with a different set of parts, both with men and women. Additionally, I would have really liked to have been a mother. Nothing seems more serene and peaceful than a pregnant mother (without massive morning sickness or other complications, I know) and it feels incredibly unfair that I won't ever get to experience that because of how I was born.

So yeah. I've thought about transitioning and decided it really, really wasn't for me. Some days I really, really like being a guy. But the days I don't make me question who exactly I am. Some days I think that in a perfect world I would have been a rowdy tomboy, but that's not possible, haha. 

Does anyone have any idea? I know labels don't define people, but I'd like some tips so I can start finding out about people a little more like me.

96,2014-07-23 05:30:40,2bgxtq,9,9,"AMAB here. I've identified as theoretically genderqueer for a while now, but mostly I never really engaged with it emotionally. So I've always presented as basically masculine, save for androgynous (maybe femmey?) glasses and hair and perhaps some personality traits. Physically I'm tall, big-shouldered, and with a high but basically masculine voice in a male-dominated career.

Well, a few weeks ago some big emotional walls came down and gender identity issues started to really hit home hard. They haven't let up since. And I'm okay with that: It's a ton of exhausting processing, but I'm excited to finally be dealing with it. I'm not sure whether I'll come out of this with a feminine identity or if I'll feel comfortable staying for a while in a genderqueer or nonbinary bucket. I'm pretty sure I'll never feel comfortable identifying or presenting 100% masculine again, though. I'm in no rush to figure that out, and I'm fortunate to have the help of an awesome therapist and loved ones as I explore.

My question, though, is about facial hair and electrolysis. I feel pretty comfortable right now saying I'll never want facial hair again. And since electrolysis typically takes a year or more to complete, it makes sense to me to start soon. The thing is, I'm still doing a ton of personal work to figure out where I'm comfortable with regard to gender presentation, and in the meantime I'm just not crazy about the idea of coming out as GQ at work. Right now I'd rather wait and cross that bridge after I start HRT (which may never happen, but it seems likely right now) and my body forces the issue. And even after things settle down, I may still like to present in boy-mode sometimes.

So I guess my question is this: If I start electrolysis without any immediate plans for HRT, how much can I expect that to feminize my face? Should I expect to keep basically passing as masculine until I'm ready to cross that bridge? My facial hair today is moderately dense and dark enough against my Caucasian skin that I can see a little shadow even right after shaving, and I definitely have some stubble by the end of the day. Getting it zapped away will not only remove that shadow, but if I understand correctly it may also slightly reshape my lips and chin since they won't be puffed up squirting out sandpaper. People will notice, obviously, but will strangers passing me in the hall be more likely to think ""Wow, he looks a tiny bit feminine in the face,"" or will it be enough to make people start doing a double take and Knowing That Person Is Weird (TM)?

Guess I'm just anxious and looking for some reassurance and perspective. Thanks!

I\'m in no rush to figure that out, and I\'m fortunate to have the help of an awesome therapist and loved ones as I explore.\n\nMy question, though, is about facial hair and electrolysis. I feel pretty comfortable right now saying I\'ll never want facial hair again. And since electrolysis typically takes a year or more to complete, it makes sense to me to start soon. The thing is, I\'m still doing a ton of personal work to figure out where I\'m comfortable with regard to gender presentation, and in the meantime I\'m just not crazy about the idea of coming out as GQ at work. Right now I\'d rather wait and cross that bridge after I start HRT (which may never happen, but it seems likely right now) and my body forces the issue. And even after things settle down, I may still like to present in boy-mode sometimes.\n\nSo I guess my question is this: If I start electrolysis without any immediate plans for HRT, how much can I expect that to feminize my face? Should I expect to keep basically passing as masculine until I\'m ready to cross that bridge? My facial hair today is moderately dense and dark enough against my Caucasian skin that I can see a little shadow even right after shaving, and I definitely have some stubble by the end of the day. Getting it zapped away will not only remove that shadow, but if I understand correctly it may also slightly reshape my lips and chin since they won\'t be puffed up squirting out sandpaper. People will notice, obviously, but will strangers passing me in the hall be more likely to think ""Wow, he looks a tiny bit feminine in the face,"" or will it be enough to make people start doing a double take and Knowing That Person Is Weird (TM)?\n\nGuess I\'m just anxious and looking for some reassurance and perspective. Thanks!\n\ntl;dr: On a scale of 1 to boobs, how much will facial electrolysis confuse my coworkers if I continue presenting as basically masculine with a few androgynous features?', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Electro and boy-mode?', 'created': 1406118640.0}"

I am going in for my first appointment tomorrow for hrt (yay!). I first came out to my mom and her husband, my step-father. My mother had always kinda knew and my step dad out right didn't believe me. Hat hurt and through respect for him I spent he next 7 years trying harder than I had ever tried to fit in as a boy. After many failed relationships,  depression and repression of feelings. I finally decided that I can no longer live this lie. I came out to my boss, who is currently my best friend, and he took to it rather well. I however talked to his long term girlfriend (5 years) and she was not so ok with it stating that I was lying to her and myself about the situation. I was heartbroken over this and I had honestly hoped that she would accept me as her me and my boss all live together and have a sort of relationship all our own. She briefly kicked me out of her apartment in order to make me think. I thought long and hard in the next few weeks as I slept outside living with no home. After the loss of her acceptance and the acceptance of both my parents I decided I would spend all of my last bit of money on alcohol and drink myself to death. Go out doing what you lived I had thought at the time. So I sat with my blue pen in hand and wrote this letter to those I loved. 

If I do not make it through the night, know first that I loved all of you. My life thus far has been a difficult 23 or so years. I feel as though I have wrestled many demons in my time. My desires all of them. They are more difficult for me to handle than I am capable of unfortunately. Know that my greatest wish and regret and wish as I lay dying is that I wasn't born a woman. Though born a man I would, no I do, quiver to think of any person remembering me as such. Please gather and mother, forgive me for letting you down; I was never the first born son you deserved. I was incapable despite my trying. Oh how I tried, oh how I tried. Next after my parents I feel an obligation to Jacob Piland (my best friend and a Mormon) know this: as a person there is something you could have done to prevent this; however as yourself, being authentic to your nature you could not have stopped me. There is no shame in this. To Luke and Sara (my boss and his girlfriend): my loves. I wish we could have been everything I have imagined. I hopeore than anything in my life that you can find the happiness in life that only I can imagine. I love you both in the least plutonic way. To Daniel: (my close friend) I will always miss your face. (He always used to say this). I pray that you will never stop missing mine. That line was the hardest to write of the lot. To Whitney: (Daniels girl friend who believed in me) thanks for believing in me. Sometimes as an adult (she is 5 years younger than me) all we need is someone's approval, someone's confirmation of our feelings. Never forget how important it is I believe. If any of you forget this principal lesson of my life than my life was for nothing and all I sacrificed for naught. Good night for what maybe the last time.

With every loving thought, I believed in your happiness.

I created this reddit account specifically to present myself as a genderqueer/non-conforming person. I hope talking with people, answering questions and commenting as a fully open and sexually positive queer person will encourage truth and openness in real life.

I'm 25 and barely starting to understand the basics of my sexuality. At the age of 22, I came out as queer to my closest friends and close family but I generally present and am perceived as a straight man. I'm a male bodied person. I've only ever had straight sex/relationships.  I would like to identify as neither straight nor man. I feel somehow that I must 'earn' this queer label though homosexual acts. At the same time I (try to) reject these thoughts as oppressive. I feel the same burden of proof concerning my gender queerness.

At 21, I remember figuring out that I wasn't straight, that I was attracted to women as well as men, and it all came together. Pieces of my past, bits of confusion over boys, liking 'gay stuff' and other things all formed an obvious bisexual picture. I couldn't believe it took me so long to admit/figure it out. I had had people ask me if I was gay, tell me I was gay, not like me because I was gay, and even tell me I would figure out later that I was gay!!! but I completely denied and disbelieved everything. 
*I no longer identify as bisexual though*

I haven't been so lucky to have such an epiphany regarding my gender though. I feel uncomfortable in my giant man body. I HATE IT...sometimes. My body has its advantages for sure, and I must address that my straight/white presentation provides me with a privilege that most queers do not have, but I feel trapped. I wouldn't pass as a female in 100yrs and I'm sad about it. I'm so insecure about my body and gender, I feel like my genetics got swirled around. As a child I feared that one day my parents would tell me they had to choose my gender at birth and that I had been somewhere in between. I even imagined some kind of procedure to 'make' me a male(crazy right?)(This has no basis in fact as far as I know.)

I really don't want to be a man but I also don't want to be a woman. I'm really confused. 
* 
* I want to be more feminine without being sexist.
* I want to be more aggressive in finding a partner but want to be submissive.
* I want to be open and honest but want to be subtle.
* I want to attract queers without looking obviously queer.
* I want to reject the gay scene but I really fucking wish I was involved.
* I want to be super cute but I'm a giant. 
* I want impossible things. I want a new body.

I reject the idea of traditional male/female roles in relationships but can't help but align with more female roles. 

I'm insecure about being so old and so confused. Who would want to entertain such an experienced person? 

I've felt I wasn't gay enough, straight enough, or queer enough.

 I hope someone has read this. My dream is to answer a million questions by all of /r/genderqueer 

Thanks for reading!!!

I'm really confused. \n* \n* I want to be more feminine without being sexist.\n* I want to be more aggressive in finding a partner but want to be submissive.\n* I want to be open and honest but want to be subtle.\n* I want to attract queers without looking obviously queer.\n* I want to reject the gay scene but I really fucking wish I was involved.\n* I want to be super cute but I'm a giant. \n* I want impossible things. I want a new body.\n\nI reject the idea of traditional male/female roles in relationships but can't help but align with more female roles. \n\nI'm insecure about being so old and so confused. Who would want to entertain such an experienced person? \n\nI've felt I wasn't gay enough, straight enough, or queer enough.\n\n I hope someone has read this.

For most my life I have struggled to find a comfortable place for my gender, and what exactly it is and how to express it. It wasn't until the start of 2013 that I really started to dig deeper and deeper about my identity. I grew to have such a dsyphoria of my body, I needed to hide away my chest because it felt weird, I started slowly dressing in more and more men's clothes. That video, spoke to me so deeply. I was almost brought to tears because what I saw in the video of Ruby Rose, was so similar to how I used to be. Forcing myself to be feminine while lying to myself. I made the first move to change my gender on facebook an hour after seeing this video. I've been listening to the song it comes with a few times now, and now the song is on repeat. I went and changed my pronoun to gender neutral terms because I feel that will fit me for now. I changed my name on facebook to become my gender neutral nickname. It's never felt so scary and amazing to do so! I am not yet used to pronouns but I also know that if someone identifies me as anything girly I won't have it, and that maybe after a few years I may realize I am a ftm trans, but above all, this video was so powerful, that it literally has moved me to make a step toward understand myself and being more comfortable in my own skin. It's been awhile since I posted here because I had an ex boyfriend that made me feel bad about my dsyphoria calling it ""gender confusion"" and saying that he didn't get what ""genderqueer"" was exactly and asking me to get more ""feminine"" hair cuts, but I'm glad that I didn't let his words sway me against being myself and let him completely destroy my self esteem. I am so glad to watch this video and I am so glad to be back here talking to everyone and sharing this with all of you.

tldr: I'm a non-dysphoric heteroflexible dude who doesn't feel the need to transition, but would probably rather be a masculine girl than a femme guy. Unsure of where to go from here.

another tldr: dammit, can't I be a hot guy with a beard and boobs who sucks his girlfriend's dick?

Long version: I'm a 29-year old male, slender but not skinny, masculine but not buff, hairy all over.
I was homeschooled, and didn't have a dad, so my male influences growing up were pretty much nonexistent. I had a small amount of dysphoria related to my genitals before I started going through puberty - I always peed to sit down because I didn't like to touch myself there - but all that changed when I discovered masturbation around 11, and I've been a proud owner of a penis ever since. I had a brief stint with crossdressing around that age, privately and purely for the sexual rush, but it was isolated to only a couple incidents (don't remember why).

I got along *way* better with girls than with guys, and to an extent, still do; it wasn't until college that I learned how to relate to other dudes, and really own my masculine form. I never dressed femme, though I also never dressed stylish at all, and it wasn't until the past few years that I started developing a personal style and being seen as someone who took pride in his appearance. I enjoy dressing up and being dapper, though sometimes I envy women's pattern choices and options for accessorizing.

I've always had girlfriends, always been attracted to women, and women have always been attracted to me. It wasn't until this past year that I ended a long-running series of relationships to pursue being single. I'm highly social and well-liked, with a great group of friends, and I don't feel put into any particular boxes I don't want to be in.

I've *always* had a fascination with gender transformations and trans* porn. I consider myself a strong trans* ally, so I've wrestled with my attraction, as I don't want to be a chaser. But I can't help that the MtF form is incredibly attractive to me, and my first sexual experience as a single guy was with my trans* friend, which confirmed the attraction wasn't just in my head. I'll reiterate that I don't feel dysphoric, but the idea of transforming feels incredibly erotic to me (which I'm well-aware is often a cis fantasy).

I identify as heterosexual, which I've interpreted more broadly to mean attraction to feminine energy. I'm attracted to women, whether AFAB or not, and occasionally more feminine guys, though I don't consider myself bi. Lately, I've begun noticing a stronger attraction to women with a sense of what I interpret as masculine energy - presenting very feminine, but with undercuts, tats, piercings - and I'm not sure where on the ""want her or want to *be* her"" continuum it falls. I still love soft cute women, and have no desire to be one.

Sexually, I consider myself a switch, since I can easily and gladly dom for someone, but would like more opportunities to be dominated myself. Really, I prefer the idea of complete equality, struggling for power in the bedroom and not always getting it.

So, here's where I stand right now. I'm a successful, non-dysphoric guy, who's starting to feel the urge to ""regress towards the mean"" a little bit, by which I mean incorporate more femininity into my life, though I don't know quite what that looks like. I'm highly attracted to the *idea* of myself as female, but I don't feel a strong need to transition; it's more that I would have chosen to be born that way if I could do it over. 

I actively enjoy my masculinity and don't necessarily want to sacrifice it, or be interpreted as presenting gay; in fact, I'm proud of my muscular legs, and want to work out more to improve my arms. I just want more femininity as well.  I'm open to starting small (but haven't yet) with crossdressing privately, and seeing if that stirs anything up, and continuing to incorporate jewelry and slightly more feminine aspects into my daily dress, striving for balance. [Conchita Wurst](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/files/2014/05/conchitawurst.jpg) is an inspiration, as is [His Black Dress](http://hisblackdress.com), though I don't necessarily want to be either of them.

I'm nearing 30, and if I actually _am_ trans*, I'd like to figure it out so I have time to do something about it. I've considered DIY HRT to get a sense for if _that_ stirs anything up, but this thought process is really only a few days old and I don't want to open that Pandora's box just yet.

And for a final exercise, I explored some of the nonbinary and genderqueer tags on tumblr to gauge my reaction to various presentations.

[Conchita Wurst](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/files/2014/05/conchitawurst.jpg) is an inspiration, as is [His Black Dress](http://hisblackdress.com), though I don\'t necessarily want to be either of them.\n\nI\'m nearing 30, and if I actually _am_ trans*, I\'d like to figure it out so I have time to do something about it. I\'ve considered DIY HRT to get a sense for if _that_ stirs anything up, but this thought process is really only a few days old and I don\'t want to open that Pandora\'s box just yet.\n\nAnd for a final exercise, I explored some of the nonbinary and genderqueer tags on tumblr to gauge my reaction to various presentations.\n\n[nope, too femme.](http://33.media.tumblr.com/da10e86a4b00bab44bfe74f5fa5689ca/tumblr_n8siqxZcvd1r1iq3ro1_1280.jpg)\n\n[same, though admire tremendously.](https://31.media.tumblr.com/cba721257038f653399850d118424c6e/tumblr_n9em7ztsVZ1qbdrkho1_1280.jpg)\n\n[hah! maybe?](http://38.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9ap5kP9ea1rrsnk3o1_500.jpg)\n\n[hmmm.

I threw in as many pieces of information as I could, and a lot of it is contradictory. I\'d be very curious to hear your interpretations and ideas.

I've spend months trying to figure out my gender identity and I'm sure I'm gender fluid.

She knows I'm trans* but judging from how she's struggled to accept that I daren't tell her I'm (grey) asexual yet [(see here for more on that)](http://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/2bxytg/my_asexual_problems/).
