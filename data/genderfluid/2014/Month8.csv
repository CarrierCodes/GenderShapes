2,2014-08-02 07:58:49,2cerjv,3,4,"Currently I identify as a panromantic demisexual person who was AMAB. I'm 20 years old. If you need to refer to me you can use he/him/his pronouns or they/them/theirs!

So I was recently at a pride festival (really fun!) and after the end of the first day I was feeling amazing. I suddenly got the idea to rig up a skirt out of an old shirt I had. I put it on and liked it. For context I have worn skirts before (like, twice, as an experiment, as a young child).

Immediately after I was done looking at myself in the mirror (I think I looked pretty good for a dude with a goatee and unshaved legs) there was a definite feeling of something ""extra"" gender-wise, that I couldn't quite put my finger on. It was definitely neutral, not feminine.

(Just to clarify I know presentation is different than identity, and that I can wear skirts and still identify as a man)

Since then I've gone back and forth between demiguy, bigender (demiguy/neutrois), androgyne, and genderfluid, and found that these all *sort of* describe how I was feeling that night.

Problem is though, I haven't felt that way since the festival. I'm back at home now and I haven't been able to recreate that experience. I tried the skirt thing again but it didn't work. It certainly feels nice but it doesn't elicit that ""extra"" feeling I got the first time. I suppose it's possible I'm genderfluid with a very strong tether to ""male"" or something similar but either way I currently feel really uncomfortable claiming a trans* label based on one night's feelings.

The only reason I mention this is because I thought I was straight for 20 years until I made some tremendous breakthroughs in my depression and self-harm problems, at which point I realized I was queer as all hell. Now however, I'm back in a bit of a slump and I can't help but notice that it seems like my gender (like my sexuality did) has ""receded"" while I'm doing less well. This is a pattern with other parts of me (re: fading out when depressed) as well and I think my gender identity may be following suit. 

The weird thing is though, since that night I routinely get this weird feeling of, ""uncoveredness""? around my pecs. Even with a shirt on I feel like something needs to be ""touching"" them? Holding/cupping my hands over my pecs and nipples seems to help make the feeling go away (sort of like how someone might grab their breasts if seen naked). I am hesitant to refer to this as dysphoria though. At worst it is a mildly disconcerting feeling that goes away after a few minutes.

I present mostly masculine currently, although if I had my way I would *definitely* experiment with feminine clothes to achieve a more androgynous look. I don't know about makeup but I would be cool with some jewelry or maybe painted nails. It wouldn't bother me too much to be read as a cis male. I would be more annoyed at not being able to present how I want to than I would be at being read as cis.


So basically, has anyone else felt their ""transness"" recede or diminish depending on their mood? Is this just a fluke? Has anyone else here had a ""flare up"" and then felt nothing for a while? And does anyone have any insight as to what this feeling is about my chest?

Thanks if you got to the end, I tried to keep it as concise as possible!

23,2014-08-05 20:13:29,2cpxwl,6,10,"I've recently started coming to terms with my queerness and while I feel more at ease within myself, I have MORE questions. 

As part of figuring out my gender identity I decided to track how I felt with regards to gender each day. When getting ready to leave the house I would choose between 3 differently colored lighters; each representing male, neither/both or, female. I found that I'd take some pleasure in the decision each morning. Throughout the day I'd use the lighter I had chosen and reassess if that choice still seemed a good fit.

In the end, the simple choice was not the benefit of this exercise. The choice gave me a chance to check-in with myself throughout the day and reminded me to take time to reflect. Personally I found no consistency to which lighter I chose or how I felt about it though the day. 

I had nearly hoped I would end up choosing female consistently but I did not. And whichever option I claimed for the day, I often didn't go the whole day feeling comfortable about sticking with that choice. 

So, what doesn't this mean in context? I think I'm genderfluid. 

I feel uncomfortable with the term because it seems to just mean more ambiguity. I'm happy to feel closer to understanding myself but as I try to define and narrow down I keep ending up with less definition. I suppose I'll have to make peace with that. 

Gender non-conforming is much more comfortable but I feel it doesn't imply any variance to one's identity. Is there another term people use? Non-conforming gender fluid? I'd like to get away from a linear male---androgynous---female system but can't help but think of it when thinking gender fluid.

Questions/ concerns about gender fluidity:

Does the term gender fluid exist within a male-female spectrum?

How can I be inconsistent in gender and still attract a partner?

How do gender fluid people in relationships fulfil different aspects of their gender with one partner? I'm not sure a person could possibly satisfy the range of identities I feel.

Is it advisable to date multiple people for the intent of satisfying my different/changing identities? i.e. being with one partner when feeling feminine and another partner when feeling masculine. I'm not sure how this could be fair to everyone involved.

I wish I could just settle on a gender and stick with it.

TLDR: I'm worried my inconsistency will impede a successful relationship. I'm worried that I'll have to compromise and that nobody can satisfy my changing gender and moods

28,2014-08-07 00:22:24,2cu72x,5,14,"[Possible dysphoria trigger warning for some readers]

I've just turned 37. Wow, that still feels weird to type. Anyway, I was AMAB, and I've theoretically identified as genderqueer for several years now. I say theoretically because for almost all of that it was mostly just a philosophical rejection of the social roles forced on us all by society, and that philosophical recognition made me happy for a while. I had some minor cross-gender personality quirks, and that was good enough for me. I didn't generally engage with it much, really.

And then, right about a month ago, something clicked big time. I broke through some emotional walls I'd set up as defense mechanisms when I was very young, and started really engaging with gender (and a bunch of other stuff) on a personal level. Over a weekend I suddenly came face-to-face with some dysphoria issues that I've been repressing for most of my life.

Most of that dysphoria centers around primary and secondary sex characteristics. I *hate* my facial hair, even when it's just a shadow. I want breasts. Really all of the effects of HRT sound great, short of the increased embolism risk. The idea of SRS sounds incredibly attractive to me, though I know I'm nowhere near ready to make that kind of decision right now. And for presentation, I noticed I've been edging here and there toward more feminine features for a little while. Playing up my curly hair. Wanting a particular style of ear piercing that I process as feminine. Slightly different ways of holding myself and moving. More and more of these things catch my attention every day. Some of them have been present for years--the physical aspects I recognize from back in my childhood--but for most of my life I've covered them up and found ways to reframe them and somehow never processed it all as a pattern until now.

The thing that's confusing to me is that as of today I don't feel any strong need to transition socially. It catches my attention when people ""sir"" me, but it doesn't feel hurtful to me. I've always been amused when people read my hair as feminine, but I don't remember specifically processing it as validating. I recognize several of my more masculine social traits as parts of those old childhood defense mechanisms, and I want to change them, but I don't feel a burning need to change my name and have people call me ""ma'am"" on the regular. I don't feel a need to wear dresses and skirts and blouses, even if I do happen to find women's underwear reduces the physical dysphoria. And I don't know how much of that disinterest in social transition is genuine and how much of it is repressed fear of the consequences that I just haven't processed through yet.

Either way I'm left at a bit of a loss for what my future looks like. Some kind of transition feels like it makes sense, but it feels nonbinary to me. I feel OK continuing to wear male button-downs and slacks to work for the forseeable future. I feel like I look pretty good in them, honestly, once I tuck down the bulge at least. I'm already looking into laser for my facial hair. But I feel pretty strongly drawn to HRT, and if I start that then I'm probably going to have to deal with at least small breasts within the next year or so. And I'm pretty nervous about the social repercussions when those breast buds get in the way as passing as a guy-with-a-few-girly-traits.

And through all of that, there's a big voice in the back of my head niggling at me, telling me that I'm just imagining this all or blowing it out of proportion to avoid dealing with some other stresses in my life. Which I suppose is possible--there are definitely some other stresses I'm dealing with--but overall seems... I don't know, unlikely to say the least.

So I guess I'm looking for some stability and comfort. I've found a gender therapist in my area, and so far I think he's pretty great. I'm looking into permanent facial hair removal. I'm wearing women's underthings for the dysphoria pretty much every day. I'm out as gender-confused-and-trying-to-figure-it-out to my closest family and friends.

So I think I'm definitely genderqueer, and I've been telling people I'm gendefluid but I'm still sort of learning and figuring things out. 

Lately I've noticed I'll police myself depending on my gender expression of the day. For example, if I'm dressed masculine I'll be more likely to make sex jokes and generally be more aggressive, and if I'm dressed feminine I'll be a little less forward and more complimenting. Same thing with relationships, if I'm seeing a guy I'll wear make up and dress cuter, but if I'm meeting a girl I'll wear something like a button down shirt and dress shoes.


Sometimes I feel like I'm playing with gender stereotypes more than I'm being true to myself. I don't want to play into gender roles, and I don't want to contribute to the sexism that's making me struggle with myself.

I had a very lucid dream that I was female and had female genitalia and actually felt them. I can't reproduce the sensations that I felt in that dream in the real world. For a while after that I fell into a moderate depression about how I wasn't female, how I wished that I was born female and stuff like that. Since then I have been researching this feeling I came across the term 'genderqueer' on the internet and found this video on youtube: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SGIJtwJ6KI

I feel EXACTLY the opposite as the female-born person in this video and a switch turned on in my head and my depression was gone. I now know that I, born male, wish that I was born female but live as a male but with the inner gender sense that I'm neither male nor female. Actually, I'm very feminine and would consider myself closer to the female identity than the male one. 

If by some magical power I was given the choice to instantly switch into a female body, I would do it. The only issue here is that I'd for sure want short hair, wear men's clothes and also be attracted to only women that were masculine or even genderqueer, themselves. As a male I don't cross-dress because I don't think that that would be as socially acceptable as for a woman to cross-dress. (?)

I'm not gay. I am only attracted to women - but the weird thing is that I'm more attracted to women that are for the majority, masculine, or even better - a genderqueer born-female that feels the opposite as I do.

So, please tell me which of these are right or wrong (and in that case, please also correct it ;)):

1. Biological gender (or sex? Is there a difference?) doesn't matter - due to what sexual organs someone has (either naturally or due to hormons/ops) defines their biological gender (I don't know if every possible combination of male/female/non existent organs is labeled, but there aren't too many so it would be possible).

2. Genderqueer people don't identify themselves as male or female (xor) but some define as both (either at different times or the same time).

That's basically the main thing I gathered and always leads me to: 

3. To NOT identify as male or female, you have to have a pretty specific set of.. rules/attributes/features/whatever you want to call it, that define what female or male is - besides biological gender, because of (1).

And that leads me to a question..

4. If one person's list (person A) of traits for ""male"" and ""female"" is very strict and defined, and anothers (person B) is less defined/more vague, doesn't that mean that B could think of himself as a typical ""normal"" man, while by A's criterias, he'd be genderqueer because he has a lot of traits from A's ""female"" list, that B doesn't even think about? 

And wouldn't that then mean, that in a way ""genderqueer"" while being against the norm that everyone has to be either male or female, instead of putting gender-norms aside, just puts more focus on them? Because of (Or: How do you get to the point of deciding what you are?)

She is super super accepting and supportive of my boyfriend, but completely acts as though I never told her anything. She will look at me wearing my nice ""men's"" clothes and ask me if I want to ""dress nice"" and hold up a dress or a skirt, or will outright laugh at me if I am wearing men's shorts and tell me I look ridiculous, when my boyfriend tells me I look great, or even downright sexy in them.

She also is constantly ""My beautiful daughter"" this and ""My little girl"" that, not just when she's complimenting me but also in attempts to butter me up before asking for a favor (For example, coming into the room and saying ""My beautiful lovely wonderful loving daughter... will you unload and load the dishwasher for me?"") 

I just really don't know what to do anymore, and am at my wit's end with how to get her to understand that what she does is very upsetting and hurtful. It almost makes me want to never present femme/female, and I can't really put into words why that is, but I hate doing it when she's around. Whenever I attempt to tell her she has hurt my feelings, she goes into what I call the ""Standing on your foot"" reasoning..

How about a fun little update? Some of you may remind me from a month or so ago, hemming and hawing over a fresh, more neutral name, getting a second opinion on the selfie, and fishing for a little advice for helping confused bystander boyfriends. :D

Any news is good news! I put in for the fresh name tag at work. While many coworkers were baffled, it was in a general way. For the most part I was content to blend in with the zillion other people (even if they ARE mostly in L.A. and New York, or whatever) who change their names just to make a new life. There were a few bold instances where I did casual mention that I had intentionally picked a more gender-neutral name. 
(As a fun side note: somewhere in the middle of all this I spontaneously came out to myself. This was a huge surprise and a bit of a laughing/crying emotional shock as I really thought I had done that already. Apparently being intellectually aware of my different-genderedness was delivered separately from emotional acceptance. I had to let that person be in the mirror for a moment to look at them and realize that I thought they were devilishly desirable, even if other people were just baffled.)

I had a plan to give that a couple weeks before letting my goatee grow out properly, but I was Oh So Tired of having to shave it every day (not shaving itself, just feeling like I had to or else I was a freak or slob), and getting pretty ballsey. Embracing a new handle had indeed worked some magic, much of it in my own mind, and I think some in the minds of others... Occasionally the evocation of my given name spilled a cupboard full of pots and pans of displaced expectations and associations into some social situations... No more! (almost ever, anyway ;3 )

So, since I'm sporting the face hair and tata's 24/7 now, I am pretty much in drag all of the time. I would say that the only time that I don't feel dragged up is when I'm dressed pretty close to center. That is usually, looser cut but stylish pants and a tailor cut collared shirt, and almost always a waistcoat. 
Of course, I still have days that are more about lace and lipstick and others that are all hippie-dude, but there is always that beard or a slight curve peeking somewhere, just in case anyone should get any firm ideas on this one being a boy or a girl. 
Doubting, that's where I want them. Anyone else?

Concerning the boyfriend, he is now a fine roommate. Things had been cooling off for a while, so the inevitable talk tied off with almost no hard feelings (I'm not one for absolutes where humans are concerned). I've known some people to have trouble living with someone post-split, and I wouldn't recommend it as a general practice. Things aren't perfect, but the familial aspect of our relation has come forth to strengthen and, heck, we're already so good about sharing stuff.
Although I do stroll around in my Best Suit (the one from my b-day) a little less often. The bro is pretty straight and cis and I occasionally think it woggles his brain somewhat uncomfortably. For now, I'd just as soon leave that alone until I have time to think about it more.

While some medical issues have kept me busy, my next big goal is to get more involved with the local GBLT community. I've enjoyed some acceptance, especially from myself, though I find that, just now, I would really like to spend some time in an atmosphere of deeper understanding and celebration of diversity. Being tolerated is fine, but this is awesome and should be a party for a little bit, you think?

TL;DR
New name is good, beard-lisptick-waistcoat is sexy, thought I had come out to myself already, but guess not, boyfriend is an okay roommate, glistening with pride.

Hi 

I'm gender fluid and bi-grey-asexual, recently (like past five days) I've been feeling a bit weird about things and getting a fair bit of dysphoria and worries about my sexuality. I'll say a bit about each below, it would be great if you could provide any advice and/or answers for any of them:

**Gender Identity (gender fluid):**

* **body hair:** Being in the latter stages of puberty (a living hell) I'm starting to grow hair on my chest and there's a few spot too. This is a terrifying prospect and I really want to get rid the hair but I can't as my mum keeps gate keeping me and talking to her a out my ""feelings"" is really awkward and torturous. I can shave my legs as I told my mum it's for cycling but on the insides of my thighs I can't avoid razor rash when shaving. I use a men's razor with five blades and shaving gel plus moisturising lotion after, but how can I avoid the razor rash!? Finally this is grim but there's hair on my butt cheeks and I don't know how to get rid of that?  But then again my gate keeping mum won't let me anyway - bitch. 

* **head hair**  I really really want to grow my hair to be like [this for example](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HU7pRRx7BQo/TXvKj64zK5I/AAAAAAAAFTc/aCeyoWC3E0s/s1600/Web%2B1.jpg) but according to my mum I ""have the wrong type of hair"". That's just bollocks she talking there. But then again I wouldn't know what to do to get my shitty short hair longer. Also my Dad and Brother have a bald patch in the middle of their heads and due to genetics and whatever I'll get one soon. I'd cry and develop depression if that happens!  What the fuck can I do? Would growing my hair longer cover it up or stop it from forming?  

* **identity** I'm currently on holiday and while walking round I'm looking at people and I look at girls - not in a perverted way - and I think now nice their legs look and how I want mine to look like that plus the clothes their wearing are really pretty and I want to wear shorts and tops like them. I also look at boys and see the clothes their wearing and I wanna look like them (the clean shaven ones anyway). Basically I don't really associate with either gender right now and I just feel like a nobody and kinda a bit broken?  I want to wear what I want but my fucking mum will kick up a fuss and interrogate me about my feelings and I can't go through that. (If would want an analogy imagine a police interrogation for murder) 

* **clothing** I would love to express my gender more but I can't because I can't buy anything remotely girly as my mum thinks I ""want to wear a dress"" and I just want skinny jeans and shirts of a women's design. I can't do fuck all without her giving me hell and being all suspicious an she think being gender fluid is the be all and end all. She just gate keeping me and I'm just suffering and becoming more depressed. 

* **not hiding** I feel trapped in that nobody knows I'm gender fluid and they all think I'm male I hate it. I want to come out to my friends but not until March as if it goes wrong then I only have two months of school left. But how can I cope with being viewed as male until then?

**Sexuality**

* **Bi-grey-asexual**  Basically I'm emotionally attracted to boys and girls but still get some sexual attraction. However I can tell any of this to my mm as asexuality would be an entirely new concept on top of transgender-ness to comprehend with. I'm ducking stuck again!  I swear it was better before I came out as trans* and duck all has happened since. 

* **dating**. I've never had a girlfriend or boyfriends where as most of my friends have had one at least. I worry constantly that I won't get a girl/boyfriend. I'm shit at striking up conversation. And who on earth is going to want to have a relationship with someone who's gender fluid and even more asexual?!  How do you actually do it?  Where do you meet people?  What do you talk about?  **What do girls find attractive?**

Thanks for any help. Please can I ask you address the above bullet points specifically rather than as a whole as I feel like total shit and really depressed. I'm going absolutely insane and i don't know. I'm hating life right now.   **Note: I don't want any hormones or any kind of surgery**

I can shave my legs as I told my mum it\'s for cycling but on the insides of my thighs I can\'t avoid razor rash when shaving. I use a men\'s razor with five blades and shaving gel plus moisturising lotion after, but how can I avoid the razor rash!? Finally this is grim but there\'s hair on my butt cheeks and I don\'t know how to get rid of that?  But then again my gate keeping mum won\'t let me anyway - bitch. \n\n* **head hair**  I really really want to grow my hair to be like [this for example](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HU7pRRx7BQo/TXvKj64zK5I/AAAAAAAAFTc/aCeyoWC3E0s/s1600/Web%2B1.jpg) but according to my mum I ""have the wrong type of hair"". That\'s just bollocks she talking there. But then again I wouldn\'t know what to do to get my shitty short hair longer. Also my Dad and Brother have a bald patch in the middle of their heads and due to genetics and whatever I\'ll get one soon. I\'d cry and develop depression if that happens!  What the fuck can I do? Would growing my hair longer cover it up or stop it from forming?  \n\n* **identity** I\'m currently on holiday and while walking round I\'m looking at people and I look at girls - not in a perverted way - and I think now nice their legs look and how I want mine to look like that plus the clothes their wearing are really pretty and I want to wear shorts and tops like them. I also look at boys and see the clothes their wearing and I wanna look like them (the clean shaven ones anyway). Basically I don\'t really associate with either gender right now and I just feel like a nobody and kinda a bit broken?  I want to wear what I want but my fucking mum will kick up a fuss and interrogate me about my feelings and I can\'t go through that. (If would want an analogy imagine a police interrogation for murder) \n\n* **clothing** I would love to express my gender more but I can\'t because I can\'t buy anything remotely girly as my mum thinks I ""want to wear a dress"" and I just want skinny jeans and shirts of a women\'s design. I can\'t do fuck all without her giving me hell and being all suspicious an she think being gender fluid is the be all and end all. She just gate keeping me and I\'m just suffering and becoming more depressed. \n\n* **not hiding** I feel trapped in that nobody knows I\'m gender fluid and they all think I\'m male I hate it. I want to come out to my friends but not until March as if it goes wrong then I only have two months of school left. But how can I cope with being viewed as male until then?\n\n**Sexuality**\n\n* **Bi-grey-asexual**  Basically I\'m emotionally attracted to boys and girls but still get some sexual attraction. However I can tell any of this to my mm as asexuality would be an entirely new concept on top of transgender-ness to comprehend with. I\'m ducking stuck again!  I swear it was better before I came out as trans* and duck all has happened since. \n\n* **dating**. I\'ve never had a girlfriend or boyfriends where as most of my friends have had one at least. I worry constantly that I won\'t get a girl/boyfriend. I\'m shit at striking up conversation. And who on earth is going to want to have a relationship with someone who\'s gender fluid and even more asexual?!  How do you actually do it?  Where do you meet people?  What do you talk about?  **What do girls find attractive?**\n\nThanks for any help. Please can I ask you address the above bullet points specifically rather than as a whole as I feel like total shit and really depressed. I\'m going absolutely insane and i don\'t know. I\'m hating life right now.   **Note: I don\'t want any hormones or any kind of surgery**\n\n Thanks again, Millie (my girl name) ', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Feeling like hell and hating life', 'created': 1407912706.0}"

I hope this is a good place to post. My older sibling (I'm going to use the masculine pronoun now because it's what I'm used to and we haven't decided on a new one yet) transitioned from female to male quite a few years ago, during his teenage years. He took testosterone and had upper-body surgery and identified as male for quite a while. My friends either know him as a transman or just know him as male.

However, recently he has begun identifying as ""gender neutral."" At least, that seems to be the most applicable term--he has used it himself. He looks like a mix of the genders. He can easily pass as male but can't really pass as female, due to all the testosterone he has taken. I don't think he wants to ""pass"" as anything anyway. I think he just wants to wear whatever he wants (dress, leggings, wig, makeup, or just jeans and a tshirt) without presenting as a particular gender. I have absolutely no problem with any of this. I support him completely. I worry about his safety when he looks like a man in ""drag,"" but that's my only concern. My question is: what to do about pronouns?

My mom and I were discussing how complicated it is to use ""they, them, their"" when that's a plural pronoun and people will just think that you're not making sense, unless you sit down and explain to them what gender neutral is (I live in a suburb and most people have no clue about this). That doesn't really work for passing conversations where you're just trying to have a quick exchange. It also gets really complicated in long conversation when you're talking about multiple people, since the pronoun is grammatically incorrect and would be hard to keep track of (although I could maybe get better at it over time). I guess I would just have to not use a pronoun in that case? And just repeat his name over and over?

Have any of you had success with using those pronouns to describe people? What kinds of reactions do you get? How do you deal with quick conversation when you don't want to explain their personal business to a stranger, but you don't want to use the wrong pronoun either (also, how big of a crime is it to use a conventional pronoun for convenience in situations like that? I'm genuinely asking).

Also, it's a lot easier to say, ""my friend, they..."" without getting questioned than it is to say ""my sibling, they..."" because people will want to know if I have a brother or a sister.

I would love to use a grammatically correct alternative pronoun. Do you have any suggestions for ones that you feel work well in the English language? My sibling knows a lot about gender theory but I don't think he really has practical experience with how using these pronouns play out in real life, with people outside the genderqueer community. When you use the alternative pronouns, do you find yourself having to explain everything all the time? If you don't want to talk about it, what's a good brush-off that's not too dismissive? What reactions can I expect?

One other thing I could use advice on is how to explain this transition to my friends and acquaintances who know him as my brother. It wasn't very complicated to say ""he's trans and identifies as male now"" when he was transitioning before. Switching pronouns was also easier because it was a conventional pronoun. Now...I'm not sure what the best thing to say would be. I don't want to have to give a speech to everybody when they ask about him. Is there a good quick description of what gender neutral is that you feel works well with people? I'm looking for something straightforward and nonconfrontational that encompasses the idea of rejecting the gender binary without throwing around ton of gender theory terms. I am open to talking about all this with people I know, as I'm not ashamed, but I'm a pretty introverted person and I don't always have the emotional energy to get deep into it.

Basically, any advice would be appreciated.

However, this post isn't about all that mostly, that was just for a little bit of context. I have posted here before and have gotten wonderful advice, so here goes again:
I recently overheard my parent and my older sibling ( my sibling who I thought I could trust to keep certain things I have confided in them confidential, but I was apparently wrong. I have never told them about my gender identity conflicts, but both sibling and parent suspect )

They are wanting to make me see a counselor that I will have no concent in choosing in a environment (school) I am uncomfortable with. They do not suspect me of being transgender or in the same vein, but rather ""rejecting of steriotypical feminity"" (as I am FAAB) 
I do not want to see a counselor from a environment I am uncomfortable with that I had no say in explaining to. I know full well my paren will explain my ""situation"" completely incorrect, as they have not shown me any compassion or support for any anxieties I have shown, though I have never spoken to them about this, as they wouldn't understand what I was saying, think I'm ""shutting them down"" and consider me rude for speaking my mind. It has gotten to the point where I feel tha I can not trust the people that I should be able to confide in.

They where speaking about us ( I have another sibling in the exact same situation as I) and that apparently my parent may talk to us about our ""behavior"" and apparently our gender issues. It bothers me t no end that they only saw my anxiety now, after years of being tormented for it by them, and even then they still dissmiss it. And the person who I thought I could trust to keep these things confidential, brings their friend that I don't even know well into my personal issues t try and ""help"" me. 

I heard all this today and haven't left my room in two days.
I called the helpline samaritains a few days ago, it didn't really help, but it was nice.
I just want things to be good between me and my family again, as I love them more than anything in the whole wide world, but I keep hurting them with actions I feel I can not control. 

What should I do? Does anyone have/had a similar experience or situation? 
I'm sorry if this is hard to follow, feel free to ask a question if you need to.
Thank you for your help. :-)


As a edit to clarify something: my parent and older sibling mentioned in this are in no way bad people. I love them a lot and understand that they may just be concerned for me. My parent especially is going through a rough patch, and due to my behavior (explained in link above) has ""given up on me"". I want my fun parent back, the one I could hang out with. While I heard they will not be surprised, disgusted or disappointed and accept me if I did ""come out"" to them, I could hear something in their voice that made me feel that they would be disappointed.

I have never told them about my gender identity conflicts, but both sibling and parent suspect )\n\nThey are wanting to make me see a counselor that I will have no concent in choosing in a environment (school) I am uncomfortable with.

I know full well my paren will explain my ""situation"" completely incorrect, as they have not shown me any compassion or support for any anxieties I have shown, though I have never spoken to them about this, as they wouldn\'t understand what I was saying, think I\'m ""shutting them down"" and consider me rude for speaking my mind. It has gotten to the point where I feel tha I can not trust the people that I should be able to confide in.\n\nThey where speaking about us ( I have another sibling in the exact same situation as I) and that apparently my parent may talk to us about our ""behavior"" and apparently our gender issues. It bothers me t no end that they only saw my anxiety now, after years of being tormented for it by them, and even then they still dissmiss it. And the person who I thought I could trust to keep these things confidential, brings their friend that I don\'t even know well into my personal issues t try and ""help"" me. \n\nI heard all this today and haven\'t left my room in two days.\nI called the helpline samaritains a few days ago, it didn\'t really help, but it was nice.\nI just want things to be good between me and my family again, as I love them more than anything in the whole wide world, but I keep hurting them with actions I feel I can not control. \n\nWhat should I do?

I love them a lot and understand that they may just be concerned for me. My parent especially is going through a rough patch, and due to my behavior (explained in link above) has ""given up on me"". I want my fun parent back, the one I could hang out with. While I heard they will not be surprised, disgusted or disappointed and accept me if I did ""come out"" to them, I could hear something in their voice that made me feel that they would be disappointed.

I've been questioning my gender for a while now. I usually come to the conclusion that I am a man. I like feeling like a man, I like other's seeing me as a man, I like seeing myself as a man. Sometimes I just get these urges to be more feminine, or more ""pretty,"" though.

As far as asking what gender I want to be, I feel like it varies. When I crossdress I feel very content thinking of myself as a woman. Other times I feel very content thinking of myself as a man. It's pretty confusing, and a little bit frustrating. People ask what gender I wish I was born as, and I honestly think I'd be equally happy as a woman or as a man, just as long as I wouldn't have to deal with this gender confusion.

There's bread rising in the kitchen.  Still got some really awesome kale soup and what might be the best butter in the world (or at least in Maine).  Decided to try a new flavor of deodorant and I like it quite a bit.  Little things like bleached arm hair and my razor bumps settling down... all good.

Yesterday afternoon I went to see *Boyhood*.  It took a while for it to sink in, and then last night was... rough.   A lot of cows coming home, I guess.  But I've been dreading coming out to my therapist - strange, right? but I do actually have anxiety issues I wanted to work on first.  Now I have some talking points, I think I can make it work.

Coming out again to my parents is going to suck.  It is going to suck *greatly* because last time I got that's-niced back into the closet.

Psychiatric side, I want off this fucking SSRI.  It makes me easily distracted, sexually frustrated, and more poignantly dysphoric.

I don't identify as a man.  I hate being told that I am a man.  Or not a woman.  It is nearly as bad as being told that I am a woman. 

I don't want to take up space in all women's events if it hurts others.  I do not want to be oppressive.

I've always been girly as shit. In my tastes if not my behavior (not sure how my mannerisms read but it doesn't feel girly). Still am. Being both girly and female has lead everyone around me, and in the past often including me, to assume that I'm cis.

Well I'm not. I haven't felt at all right identifying as a girl since I was at least 11 ,though the feeling was incredibly vague back then. But since agender isn't a very visible thing, I was confused for a very long time. I remember crying myself to sleep as a teenager, upset at being a girl, but not *really* feeling like a guy either, at least not a remotely masculine one. It was only when I saw this cute little cartoon poem about some different kinds of genderqueer that it started to make sense. Thanks cartoon poem! Sometimes complicated things need to be dumbed down a little.

Now I question the validity of coming out. I don't come across as queer to others (that I know of) so I wonder if there's any value in it, especially since those around me are probably going to be confused as hell if nothing else. But recent changes in my personal life have caused me to become extremely lonely, and being in the closet agender is making this worse. I've been crying for weeks now. So I'm thinking of coming out to my psychiatrist, seeing how that goes, and taking the rest from there.

I hope it goes well and I hope I'm making the right decision. And I desperately hope that one day I can find the courage to be accepted for who I am instead of what people just assume I am. I'd love to hear about your experiences with this as well.



UPDATE: Thank you so much everybody for your replies, they really mean SO much to me. It's a really big deal for me to know I'm not alone and that there are people who get it even if we've never met face to face. 

I saw my psychiatrist today, and I explained how I've been feeling. He was a little taken aback because he had never heard of the term ""agender"", but he was totally accepting and asked a lot of questions so he could understand as well as possible and distinguish it from asexuality, being intersexed, or wanting to be a man. He asked about how we might choose to look physically and if anyone transitions. I told him some do in order to be more in the middle, and that if I could look like the girliest boy you'd ever seen I'd be thrilled. He laughed because most people would totally hate that. I told him I was leaning towards not taking hormones, but he was curious about my levels anyway so he sent me for a blood test to check my testosterone, so if it comes out particularly low it might give me a reason to go on a low dose, which he's unquestioningly open to.

The reason I feel like I look dikey is because of my huge breasts. I am planning on getting a reduction, partly medical as well as social decision. My maternal grandmother was a leading lesbian in the area, dressed as a man, worked ""man"" jobs. So, my mother has no understanding of genderqueer presentation or philosophy. She sees women wearing men's clothing as lesbians. I don't think that she has a problem with the acceptance of other sexualities, but she does expect lesbians to act within the tropes of lesbian stereotypes. She has no idea of my sexuality, mainly because I keep my dating life very private and usually only have one public partner. I am poly and pan, my genderqueer-ness is somewhat recent of a discovery to me prompted by my deep hatred for my own breasts.


I told her I wanted to get a reduction and only mentioned the medical reasons, which are enough imo. Most of my reasoning is that I just don't want boobs. Maybe tiny ones since I have my fluid days of wearing dresses and heels, but not JJ ones like I have now. I never attract women or ass loving men. Nor do I attract other genderqueer people into my circle of friends since I just cannot pull off an androgynous look unless I change my whole outer image and bind my breasts which makes my back ache more. I have resorted to wearing masculine bottoms and fitted tops which is pretty popular as office wear these days. I do not feel like it represents me. 


I guess I am just having troubles getting myself organized for who I want to be and how I can make that happen. I have always wanted to be an androgynous woman. I have an extremely ""masculine"" mind and work ethics, if you are following the traditional definitions of those terms. It just kills me that I will never look the part and that I may never get my mother to understand this part of me. My dad and brother will follow suit - if my mom is okay, then they are. However, they are not outwardly vocal about the opinions they hold normally and my brother is aware that I have dated a woman. 


I am seeing my primary care about breast reduction surgery this Friday. I am really hoping that I receive news that it is at least possible. I know that it is covered by my insurance if it is deemed medically necessary. I know back pain and bra scars are some things but I am worried it is not enough.

The short of it is, I'm MAAB and think I'm genderqueer/genderfluid but I don't trust my motivations because of the way cis men are outsiders/villianized somewhat (for good reason IMO) in the feminist and LGBT communities, which are pretty much my entire social network. I also have very little body dysphoria. So I can't tell if I want to be a genderqueer woman because I am a genderqueer woman, or because I just don't want to be a cis man. And I don't want to be a transtrender, or appropriating other people's struggle, because I agree that's icky and gross and inappropriate.

---

For those with time to kill, the long of it is:

Right now, I feel genderfluid and genderqueer. Most days, I feel somewhere in the middle of the ""feminine"" half of the gender spectrum. Some days I feel good about and enjoy being a man. Other days I find it, while not unbearable, generally grossly masculine and unpleasant. It also varies with relationships--I enjoy taking the traditionally ""male"" role in intimate relationships and I'm pretty aggressively masculine in bed. I've heard people talk about worrying their trans identity is a fetish, and it's the opposite for me: my feminine self is pretty much unrelated to sex. Right now I'm not really interested in HRT, but very much want to transition socially.

I've heard people talk about ""internal"" ""social"" and ""body"" dysphoria, but I think I experience only the first two... I desperately WANT to be seen socially as a woman. I prefer my social circle to be mostly women and I'm generally uncomfortable around men and find it more difficult to relate to them. Most of my interests would be considered feminine. My ideal expression is very feminine. I love how I look wearing dresses and makeup; it feels incredibly right and I think I look beautiful. But my relationship with my body seems ""cis."" I pretty much always wish I looked like a woman, and am envious of women on the street that look like I wish I did. But I don't experience real dysphoria around feeling like my body is ""wrong."" While I'm envious of the more curvy feminine bodies other women have and would like that in an abstract sense, if I try to actually imagine myself with breasts or something I feel deeply uncomfortable (sort of what it sounds like trans men experience--that they would be ""out of place"" or ""wrong."") This might be because I have a naturally feminine body--tall but slender, delicate hands, round face, long hair. But I really love my beard, and have no interest in getting rid of it (this is why I feel more genderqueer instead of straight up genderfluid). The only body-related dysphoria I experience is triggered by social stuff: I've always disliked my body hair, but since presenting more as a woman it's become more intensely upsetting. I have big feet, which never upset me until I tried to go shopping for women's shoes and saw just how ""unwomanly"" my feet were.

So that's making me doubt it, but my history is what's really giving me doubts. I can't remember ANY serious feeling of being the wrong gender until I was in my 20s, when I experienced several social changes. Growing up I was a weird kid and a social outsider; I didn't feel like I fit in with men OR women really, but I performed masculinity dutifully (it was definitely a self-aware performance, but so was every other aspect of trying to fit in). In my early 20s when I found feminism (and then the rest of the social justice stuff) I dug in and it revolutionized my worldview. I began reading kinda obsessively about gender, trans, and third-gender/genderqueer stuff in particular, over what I at first thought was just an academic interest in being a good trans ally. Around this time I also became polyamorous and moved to a city with a big queer community, which pretty much made my entire community queer people in which I was one of the only straight cis men around. Once I met other gender non-conforming folks I began tiptoeing in that direction... Over the course of three years it's moved from just-at-costume-parties, to jewelry, then makeup, then a desire for female pronouns. Drugs also have pushed me into ""ladyspace"" and until recently it was only when I was on drugs that I could identify as a woman to myself. to The entire time I've been subconsciously edging towards genderqueer but never actually admitting it to myself that's what I was doing (""you just like jewelry! you're just stoned!""). Six months ago I started identifying as ""gender non-conforming"" (since I was wearing women's clothes at that point). Three weeks ago after crossdressing 'casually' for the first time I gave myself permission to view myself as a genderqueer woman and it was like a giant wave of relief crashed over me. I broke down crying pretty much every day for a week and felt wonderfully sure. But now the relief is gone and I'm full of doubts again.

The real confusing part is my discomfort with my male identity developed over time, and coincided with:
(1) My increasingly feminine presentation. The more I move towards genderqueer, the more I need it. Back when the extent of my ""femininity"" was just skinny jeans and dressing nice, that was all I needed and I felt pretty comfortable in it. Now there are days when I feel pretty upset that I'm not wearing women's clothes.
(2) My immersion in the queer community that I did not feel a part of and feel like an outsider in. I fully admit that one of the reasons I want to be seen as genderqueer is to be accepted into the community instead of an ""ally"" but... I can't tell if I want that so I'll just feel like I belong somewhere, or because I want to belong THERE because those ARE the members of my community.
(3) My immersion in feminist discourse which has a tendency to demonize men and often relegate them to positions of ""male ally"" or ""listen before you speak."" I understand why these principles are in place, but my identity as a feminist is very important to me, and the fact that I am viewed with suspicion/distrust because I'm a male is painful. Again, I don't know if this is just selfish ""but I wanna be accepted"" or if it's more acutely painful to me because I feel not-male and don't want to be lumped in with that grouping. I've never really liked men myself, and being in this discourse has definitely made that worse and turned me into somewhat of a self-hating man. So I've definitely got some misandry (which also involves thus viewing women as kinda morally superior/pure). I realize these are legit issues that I need to work on. In the meantime, I can't disentangle these in my mind, or trust myself to do so honestly. Am I actually a woman, or just a self-hating man that wants to be a woman so I can be pure and unsullied by the original sin of being a dude?

So, I desperately want to be a genderqueer woman. The fact that my body seems ""correct,"" my identity has changed very slowly (and in my 20s), and there are other ""benefits"" to transitioning means I don't trust my motivations. But I'm a very self-doubting person and don't trust my motivations a lot, so I don't know if that means anything in this instance. If I try to imagine a world where none of these other issues existed and I could choose my gender freely, I feel confident I would choose woman. But I don't live in that world, so I can't be sure.

Does anyone else experience these thoughts? Do you have any resources? Can you smack me upside the head? Tell me I'm a genderqueer woman, tell me I'm a transtrender, whatever.

I'm FAAB and have thought about transitioning to male and I go by a male name and pronouns in most of my life, and I present as male/masculine.

I suffered with Dissociative Identity Disorder (Multiple Personality Disorder) for the last two years and have only recently started making a recovery. I had 20+ alters of all different ages and genders. I've only just started to live without them as a more integrated person. I've made a lot of progress in realizing that I am only one person, not several. However, now the previously split aspects of me have come together into a whole that I'm not sure I fully understand. 

I've thought a lot about HRT, but haven't taken any steps towards that yet. The idea that I may regret it terrifies me.  Despite that, I've desired it for a while so I could have a more masculine look and facial hair, because I had a lot of dysphoria. Now, and it feels like out of nowhere, the idea of that makes me uncomfortable; but looking feminine doesn't make me feel comfortable either. 

I try to remember that gender identity doesn't directly relate to gender stereotypes, but I struggle with stereotypes regardless because you just can't get away from them. I'm interested in a lot of things stereotypically associated with men, but I'm also interested in things like dance, knitting, and doll customization. Maybe it's silly but I'm scared if I made the full transition to male, I just wouldn't ""fit in"", I'd get made fun of. 

I'm filled with dread because I just can't figure out who I am. One day I'm completely certain that I'm male, and that I want to transition to male. The next day I hold myself back and immerse myself in feminine things, almost as if I'm trying to make up for something. 

I wish I could make up my mind because I don't feel like I can do this back and forth anymore. If I could just be at least mostly sure and happy, I don't care where I end up. I just want to get there.

124,2014-08-27 03:20:40,2eoxy1,8,7,"Everyone here is welcome to share their stories. I have only recently become vocal of my queer identity and still mostly here or on other online sites. I feel that there are more and more people I see every day welcomed into our community that are looking for support and guidance. I figure I will share my own discovery story and thoughts, and how I view my corporeal and metaphysical presence today.


I felt different from many as a kid for as long as I can remember. I didn't care about hair and make-up or boys to the extremes that my peers did. The first time I was sexually aroused, it was by a friend who came over to play barbies. For some reason, she was just different that day. Nothing happened but I remembered the physicality of it being warm and pleasant. I had a few crushes of girls and boys. It wasn't until middle school that I realized I was different because I liked boys clothing more. I loved my body curves and how they looked with straight dress pants and started growing boobs due to puberty around age 9. Boobs grew super fast. I hated them immediately. Not because they were so sudden, but they just didn't feel necessary or pretty to me. I wanted to have my flat chest again. I had loved running around and being active, something I was learning very quickly wasn't something that society approved of females doing to the extreme that I wanted. My mother didn't like that I abhorred pink and dresses. But she was very accepting of me trying new things and dressing myself the way that I wanted as long as it didn't have skulls on it, which I compromised with her on.


High school was a big of a struggle. I didn't know at the time, but my hormonal production and thyroid were fucked. I had hypothyroid starting around 13 years old by dr's guess. So, high school was a blur of hating the fashions I was expected to wear and being called lesbian and teased for not being ""pretty"" wearing make-up and pink. I wore more jewelry and feminine clothing than I would have liked. Feeling down all the time, I didn't put any effort into making myself an external representation of ""me."" 


College was great, but did nothing for my gender identity. My discovery plateaued. I started hormones for my thyroid and suddenly had a sex drive. I dated a few people, men and one woman. I got my mom to stop asking me to dress nicer although she still asks me to do gender normative things with her like shopping and cleaning. I was able to realize I was bisexual and acted on it right when I started school. It was no problem with the community I was in thankfully. 


It wasn't til after college, age 22, that I fully realized my queer and fluid gender. It happened out of a few arguments with my ex. He demanded gender normative roles in the house to which I said fuck it. He started telling me I was ugly and unwanted because I wasn't feminine enough. I had even started dressing and acting more feminine around him because I felt him pulling away and wanted to attract him back. That relationship ended and I had a long hard think about all the insecurities and issues I had while in the relationship, many of which ended up being that I felt sexy in a different way than most people I knew and that I hadn't been myself.


I have realized over the past few months now that I feel like a man mentally with a feminine body. My brain feels more traditionally masculine. I fluctuate between feminine and masculine projections of myself and am overall fluid. For me, love does not have a gender, but I utilize many traditionally and socially feminine things to express myself. I still do not like my breasts. I want to be able to have other genderqueer people in my friend group - something I am just now trying to do. My discovery is relatively new. I am still finding new things out. I like wearing skirts but I feel more masculine in them than feminine for some reason. 


I may be getting a breast reduction in the near future. I have had back pain for a while now, but also not liking them has made it easier to progress to the point of a reduction. So many people do not want me to get one although they know it would be for health and pain relief. I have struggled to help people understand that breasts are no necessary for an identity, it should be based on personality and not boobs. 


All in all, I feel like a non-feminine female. I like having my female body, sans boobs. I like dressing it in masculine clothing but also skirts.

128,2014-08-27 17:03:51,2eqnul,5,9,"Hello everyone, I'm a 26 year old MTF and I've been on HRT for a little over 8 months now. I'm going to try to not throw a huge wall of text at you so I will try to explain myself as briefly as I can. 

When I was a teenager I had a big thing for androgyny. I liked looking like ""something in the middle"" though probably leaning more towards feminine. I never wore things like skirts, stockings, etc and didn't have much of an interest either to be honest. I bought girl clothes that could've been boy clothes mainly. On top of that I liked wearing make up and learned how to do it roughly in the same time frame.

For a few years I loved the questioning looks I got from strangers and the general confusion people had at attempting to gender me. *It was fun.* Even my interests were pretty evenly split between boyish stuff and girly stuff. Plus, it made it more fun to explore my sexuality, but that's a different story...

So, fast forward through college and early adulthood because nothing that interesting happened there and get to where I am at 25 years old. I'm depressed, my self-esteem is in the toilet, and I'm completely withdrawn from everything and then I started HRT and things started changing for me again. I watched my body slowly (sorta) change and I was *happy* again. Though, I still dressed completely male or more towards the male side of androgyny. 

I started boy mode failing randomly about three months ago or so and it was huge for my confidence! So, over time I worked up the nerve to buy some clothing that strongly gendered female and when I put them on I was extremely uncomfortable. It didn't feel right, and the fact that it didn't feel right terrified me honestly. I went right back into my boy clothes and went back to the mall and started shopping again and bought some ""butchier"" clothing and it kinda dawned on me... I like being androgynous, though I definitely like being more feminine than masculine these days.

I guess my question is... What exactly am I? I already kinda figure I am outside of the binary but I'm not sure what it makes me.

I\'m going to try to not throw a huge wall of text at you so I will try to explain myself as briefly as I can. \n\nWhen I was a teenager I had a big thing for androgyny. I liked looking like ""something in the middle"" though probably leaning more towards feminine. I never wore things like skirts, stockings, etc and didn\'t have much of an interest either to be honest. I bought girl clothes that could\'ve been boy clothes mainly. On top of that I liked wearing make up and learned how to do it roughly in the same time frame.\n\nFor a few years I loved the questioning looks I got from strangers and the general confusion people had at attempting to gender me. *It was fun.* Even my interests were pretty evenly split between boyish stuff and girly stuff. Plus, it made it more fun to explore my sexuality, but that\'s a different story...\n\nSo, fast forward through college and early adulthood because nothing that interesting happened there and get to where I am at 25 years old. I\'m depressed, my self-esteem is in the toilet, and I\'m completely withdrawn from everything and then I started HRT and things started changing for me again. I watched my body slowly (sorta) change and I was *happy* again. Though, I still dressed completely male or more towards the male side of androgyny. \n\nI started boy mode failing randomly about three months ago or so and it was huge for my confidence! So, over time I worked up the nerve to buy some clothing that strongly gendered female and when I put them on I was extremely uncomfortable. It didn\'t feel right, and the fact that it didn\'t feel right terrified me honestly. I went right back into my boy clothes and went back to the mall and started shopping again and bought some ""butchier"" clothing and it kinda dawned on me... I like being androgynous, though I definitely like being more feminine than masculine these days.\n\nI guess my question is... What exactly am I? I already kinda figure I am outside of the binary but I\'m not sure what it makes me.

I've always kinda had gender dysphoria but brushed it off as being rebellious and fighting the patriarchy and being a butch bi chick and a million other excuses. I'm also pretty newly dating a transitioning binary transwoman who is very dysphoric herself. She originally was very, very dismissive of nonbinary identities - often saying things about ""special snowflake"" genders, etc. She's trying to be better about it now, but she still doesn't get that I don't really feel right in my body and no matter how many times I tell her that I don't identify fully as a woman (no matter if I dress femme about half-to-two-thirds of the time) she keeps using really gendered terms for me - calling me a woman, her girlfriend, beautiful, grabbing my boobs all the time (a major source of dysphoria for me), and even referring to us as in a ""lesbian"" relationship. 

Honestly, I don't know how else to explain it to her, and I love her and I know she doesn't realize what she's doing, and I was wondering if any of you have had similar experiences with binary trans folk or can help in any way because I'm about ready to rip my hair out. 

**Edit** I spoke to her and it seems that she did not realize how important not using gendered terms was to me, because I am so newly out, and she was afraid of outing me in public by NOT introducing me as her girlfriend, etc. We're working on finding substitutes for gendered terms, and she's very receptive to that.

Just a lot of girls always say they don't like being a girl and would have preferred to be a boy.

141,2014-08-31 05:25:14,2f2av3,5,8,"Content: discussion of not liking my body, including mentions of dieting and exercising

Gender stuff has been on my mind again. I’ve thought about it before and have come to the conclusion that I’m *not* trans or non-binary. I guess I'm just wondering what other folks make of this or whether it resonates with other people at all?

I think in large part I am more inclined to think about my gender and my body because I’m surrounded by trans people and discourses and resources. I did idly wonder the other day why I surround myself with these things though. It feels like more than just ‘wanting to be a good ally’; it feels personal. 

I don’t want to be a man, I really don’t. And I like being a woman, which is partly personal and partly intensely political. I feel like if I was describing myself as non-binary I would be less of a woman, and that feels wrong for me.

But sometimes I want to world to see me differently to how they do. Sometimes I want it to see me as a twinky boy, or a masculine woman. Sometime I want it to see me as femme man, or as a masculine woman. An androgyne or femme woman.

Or is that just a manifestation of the eternal queer dilemma of not knowing whether I want to fuck these kinds of people of be them?

I’ve been exploring the last one - femme woman - a lot lately and that has been really exciting. This body, with its breasts and especially its hips and thighs, is easily able to code femininity and womanliness. I’ve spent over a decade learning how to dress this body; which kinds of cuts and designs will make me feel attractive and not-too-fat. Especially how some styles of skirts and dresses will make my hips and thighs appear not-quite-as-big.

And engaging with queer femme and body positive communities has allowed me to learn to love this body. I’m learning how to be proud and apologetic of this body and that feels *good*.

But there are other ways I’d like to present which I find really difficult to do in this body and clothes I’d love to wear but avoid because doing so makes me feel sad about all the things this body will never be. In particular, this body will never have the broad shoulders and narrow hips I crave.

I’ve thought about going on testosterone a lot. Not because I want to live as a man but because I want my body to look different and my voice to sound different.

But I know that T isn’t going to make me magically look like the twinky boys whose bodies I adore. This body, the one I have now, has fat on it and much of that fat is probably going to stay on my hips and thighs. What does move is going to move to my stomach, one part of my body that I really do love.

I don’t want to go on T because I’ve done a lot of work to be okay with this kinda-fat womanly body. The work I’d need to do to be okay with a kinda-fat, not-really-masculine body just seems like too much. I think about dieting and working out every now and again but I have to put that aside - indulging in those practices makes me feel crazy.

I've been looking at top surgery for the future if I ever muster the money, but I don't know. I've heard you typically should see a gender identity therapist first and I'm not sure whether they'd take me seriously enough. First off, I am a teenager. I accept and see how they would say this might just be a ""phase"".

Now, I've considered that and while I really don't believe this is a phase (with feelings lingering for more than two years) I do see the reason in waiting until I'm an adult. The only problem with that though is that I still have two years until I'm 18 and not only that, but I'll be going to college so I highly doubt I'll be able to afford surgery.

So I guess my question is how should I proceed with this? Should I see a gender identity therapist now or wait? How did you deal with your chest (if you had to)? Or just what was your experience over all?

Thanks in advanced.",genderqueer,"Having chest dysphoria, not sure how to proceed.",1409545341.0,"{'created_utc': 1409520141, 'id': '2f43u0', 'num_comments': 11, 'score': 9, 'selftext': 'Okay so for a couple of years now I\'ve been hating my breasts.
