I like feminity, but I dont want to be....a girl. I want to be a pretty male, I guess if that makes sense, so i suppose im more classified as genderqueer. I feel that I am in fact male, feel so dysphoric over breasts and dont see the vagina as really a part of me (I handle it because I can easily get prosthetic penises) I cant be gendered right in public...ever...I can bind, fake my hairline, wear more guyish clothes all I want, but as soon as I open my damn mouth or they take a look at my scrawny arms and legs, its very clear I get labeled as a girl.

I want to go on T to deepen my voice, help get a little more muscle in my chicken limbs and look even a little more masculine. Hell I'd even be happy if people were just plain confused as to what I am. But...I cant do that right now, and its devastating me. Some things I've been considering about T:

1) how long on T will I develop a deeper voice and a bit more of a masculine appearence? I dont see myself on it for the rest of my life because I dont want to be a super masculine man, instead pretty and androgynous but still have more masculinity than I have now (I'm TOO damn feminine)

2) do you gain a lot of weight on it? I know obviously fat moves around and redistributes and more muscle tone can be gained. I mean more of in terms of would it make me go from slender to too chubby for my stature? 

3) how do you go about beginning it? Can you just ask your doctor or do you need to go through a therapist first?

4) and finally; injections....how do you guys do it? I hate hypodermic needles so much....I'm not sure if I could...stick them in myself.

I am 33, MAAB, and full of questions.

My self identity is something I have struggled with for some time, in varying degrees.  A lot of the time I feel it has taken a backseat to other responsibilities or was incompatible with my professional life.

However, as aspects of my life are going out of control, I am fighting to find something I can control, and it's time I shed some much needed light on the matter of just who I am.

I am not sure what I want, other than to be happy with myself.  Which I haven't been, for quite some time.  I feel somewhere between boy and girl, but I don't want to feel nailed down until I've explored all the options.  I've been making introductions in a couple communities and seeing what happens.

I feel lucky to be alive in a time where this community exists and scared because society is still so focused on a yes/no response.  Fuck you, I want to be me?

41,2014-02-11 18:04:29,1xmpep,6,2,"Hello, I am a FAAB who have gotten tired of not knowing who I am.
Today I booked an apointment to se a psychiatrist/youth worker  on thursday to talk about starting a so called ""gender investigation"" to try and find out Who/what I am and also how I want to live/look.
This all feels very scary and taking the step to actually talk about this for the first time is making me feel very nervous.
I don't know what changes I will want to make for myself. 

I’ve never been able to pinpoint my gender identity. I am physically a female. I am very shy and quiet which many would interpret as very feminine. But when I feel comfortable I tend to act more like a guy. 
I mainly feel comfortable looking very guyish but would like to be able to pass as both male and female.

Since I met my boyfriend about one year ago I started dressing more feminine and grow my hair out. 
I think I did this in order to “fit in” as a girlfriend. And also because I felt very intimidated by girls since I felt like I had to compete against their beauty and femeninity. 
Now my boyfriend is studying abroad and I feel like I can think clearly about these things. And I’ve noticed how my self esteem has dropped since I started forcing myself to be more feminine. 
I’m probably going to get the scissors out soon and just cut all of my hair off.

I've always felt comfortable and happy when being mistaken for a guy, but I don't want to pass as one all the time so it’s not that I want a full transformation.
What I do want is a slightly deeper voice, more muscles and smaller boobs (and my old self esteem back).

A funny thing is, whenever I see a muscular dude I go ""Damn he's so hot ...I'll never be able to look that good :(""
Shapeshifter powers would be nice.

On to the questions!

So basically what I want to know is, do you think it could be possible to alter my voice slightly if I go on T and then get off it when I feel that my voice is where I want it to be? 

How/when should I tell my boyfriend that I’m... well, something other than just female? How have these kinds of conversations worked out for you? How did your SO, family and friends react? 
Perhaps I just shouldn’t say anything. Just start acting and looking the way I’m comfortable and let them ask questions when/if they feel like it.

If you have taken or are taking hormones, please tell me about your experiences, were there any unexpected effects? How do people react to you now as compared to before? etcetera.

I am physically a female. I am very shy and quiet which many would interpret as very feminine. But when I feel comfortable I tend to act more like a guy. \nI mainly feel comfortable looking very guyish but would like to be able to pass as both male and female.\n\nSince I met my boyfriend about one year ago I started dressing more feminine and grow my hair out. \nI think I did this in order to “fit in” as a girlfriend. And also because I felt very intimidated by girls since I felt like I had to compete against their beauty and femeninity. \nNow my boyfriend is studying abroad and I feel like I can think clearly about these things.

Theae are probably some ""basics"" of being genderqueer/fluid/etc. but I don't exactly have a mentor on how to present as different genders as the days change or moods strike, so I could use a little guidance.

This round of questions regards altering appearance for different gender identities. I am a male-bodied person who uses gender-neutral pronouns [they/them/their], but wants to present as female much more often than I do currently. I won't feel comfortable going shopping for ""women's"" clothing [blech, binary!] unless I can ensure my body looks at least slightly more feminine. On that note, here are my questions.

First on the list: how do I make it appear that I have breasts? I'm unsure what the official term for such a tool/item would be. I'm thinking something like a reverse binder? Is this a real thing? I'm clueless.

Second, the pelvic area: I understand that ""tucking"" is the verb I'm describing, but how do I go about it? Anything I should know [regarding health concerns, etc.] surrounding it? Also, is there a way to make it appear that my hips are slightly wider?

Well, I'm MAAB and I'm bigender or trans and genderqueer or something, I'm not entirely sure yet, but I've got time to figure it out. 

A big question I've had for a while is shaving vs waxing? Which do you guys prefer, what brands of razors, skin care and/or waxes you use if you do it at home or what you get when you go to a spa or salon. 

For anyone else who's male, leaning towards the feminine side or is a trans woman, what brands of clothing do you like best? I personally like close-fitting stuff like spandex, leggings, skinny jeans, and baggy shirts so I can get away with wearing a bra. Would you recommend any stores to me?

 So I just found out about a new class of drugs called SERMs, selective estrogen-receptor modulators, designed to prevent breast cancer without breaking hips. Tamoxifen and raloxifene are the 2 big ones but they all do basically 2 things - act as an agonist (stimulate growth) in bones and uterine lining, and act as an antagonist in breast tissue.

..but I often feel like I do.

Hello Reddit! I've been on this site (though not specifically this subreddit) for about a year now, and I'm using this throwaway account to gauge some opinions. (I'm a guy...at least at first appearance to most people I know in this world.) I was inspired by /u/InquisitiveYoungLad [1] to ask anonymously.

In 2007 I was in a class and had to perform a skit about abuse with two girls. Now, I'm a video gamer and a sports freak, though I am horribly unathletic, but I'm not much of a traditional guy at all. Being in quite a few honors and advanced classes there have been times where I have been all but surrounded with girls.

Anyway, for the purpose of the skit, the two girls realized having me play a guy was not workable, and so they asked me to be a girl.

I was quite shell shocked at this request since it was not something I'd ever do, but I really didn't have much of a choice. The one girl put a ponytail (even if it was 1 cm long) in my short hair, and I role played the skit as ""Jasmine"" (you may call me that here, not my real female name). I was quite surprised to enjoy that experience and began playing ""Jasmine"" to a couple of school friends. I also adopted Jasmine as a sort of online persona for parts of myself, and that way I met a couple online friends as well. By 2010 I was regularly RPing Jasmine with a couple of them, and I was inspired to begin writing a novel with Jasmine as the main character a year later.

In the fall of 2012, after about two months of hospice care, a close relative of mine died out of town. My family had to travel for their funeral, and as it was the first death in the family to really impact me, I was shaken. While I am a political and social liberal, I did not expect my fairly conventional Christian faith to be gutted so quickly. I started looking at other options faithwise. And at the same time, I was experiencing a growing feeling rise within me that I was Jasmine, not my guy self. Even a faith retreat I went on could not stop Jasmine's momentum. It was like I had caught Jasmine Fever. At this time I also had a school friend who really was encouraging to me but had her own personal issues, and her cloud of darkness extended over me at times. What's more, my parents didn't know that Jasmine was growing so quickly. I couldn't cross dress or act trans for a variety of social and family reasons, but that was how I felt inside. I felt like my guy self had become a shell housing Jasmine and not much else.

I tried to tell my parents in May, and at that point I kinda broke down emotionally, realizing I probably wasn't ready to embark on the trans road. For a while, the feminine feelings subsided, but within a few months they were back and they still gnaw at me. Jasmine and my guy self love to clash, and I often wonder, what if I had always been her? I feel slightly more masculine than I did then, but I still relate better to girls and inside wish that one day I could feel what it is like to be a girl. I'm not sure what I'm feeling now, where I am, or where I am meant to be with Jasmine. That's why I'm here, to ask people more seasoned about these sorts of feelings. I can't decode them in full, and Jasmine is still gnawing at me, making me wish I could become her... And it doesn't help that another family member died recently, with similar arrangements.

Any thoughts and comments are appreciated. During the height of Jasmine Fever I truly felt trans, something that is not so much the case now. I still have incredible empathy for trans people and all they have to go through, and my faith life is still quite weak and vulnerable—oh yes, and I'm now in college. Any advice is of great use to me.

Being in quite a few honors and advanced classes there have been times where I have been all but surrounded with girls.\n\nAnyway, for the purpose of the skit, the two girls realized having me play a guy was not workable, and so they asked me to be a girl.\n\nI was quite shell shocked at this request since it was not something I\'d ever do, but I really didn\'t have much of a choice. The one girl put a ponytail (even if it was 1 cm long) in my short hair, and I role played the skit as ""Jasmine"" (you may call me that here, not my real female name). I was quite surprised to enjoy that experience and began playing ""Jasmine"" to a couple of school friends. I also adopted Jasmine as a sort of online persona for parts of myself, and that way I met a couple online friends as well. By 2010 I was regularly RPing Jasmine with a couple of them, and I was inspired to begin writing a novel with Jasmine as the main character a year later.\n\nIn the fall of 2012, after about two months of hospice care, a close relative of mine died out of town. My family had to travel for their funeral, and as it was the first death in the family to really impact me, I was shaken. While I am a political and social liberal, I did not expect my fairly conventional Christian faith to be gutted so quickly. I started looking at other options faithwise. And at the same time, I was experiencing a growing feeling rise within me that I was Jasmine, not my guy self. Even a faith retreat I went on could not stop Jasmine\'s momentum. It was like I had caught Jasmine Fever. At this time I also had a school friend who really was encouraging to me but had her own personal issues, and her cloud of darkness extended over me at times. What\'s more, my parents didn\'t know that Jasmine was growing so quickly. I couldn\'t cross dress or act trans for a variety of social and family reasons, but that was how I felt inside. I felt like my guy self had become a shell housing Jasmine and not much else.\n\nI tried to tell my parents in May, and at that point I kinda broke down emotionally, realizing I probably wasn\'t ready to embark on the trans road. For a while, the feminine feelings subsided, but within a few months they were back and they still gnaw at me. Jasmine and my guy self love to clash, and I often wonder, what if I had always been her? I feel slightly more masculine than I did then, but I still relate better to girls and inside wish that one day I could feel what it is like to be a girl. I\'m not sure what I\'m feeling now, where I am, or where I am meant to be with Jasmine. That\'s why I\'m here, to ask people more seasoned about these sorts of feelings. I can\'t decode them in full, and Jasmine is still gnawing at me, making me wish I could become her... And it doesn\'t help that another family member died recently, with similar arrangements.\n\nAny thoughts and comments are appreciated. During the height of Jasmine Fever I truly felt trans, something that is not so much the case now. I still have incredible empathy for trans people and all they have to go through, and my faith life is still quite weak and vulnerable—oh yes, and I\'m now in college. Any advice is of great use to me.\n\nThanks, Jasmine', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Figuring out gender identity (x-post from /r/TwoXChromosomes)', 'created': 1392802463.0}"

I'm AFAB but I identify as genderqueer and pansexual. I present pretty masculine (bind my chest, etc.) although I'm not macho or anything. I'd probably equate my presentation to ""somewhat effeminate dude"" if that makes sense.

I'm in a relationship with an AMAB person who also identifies as genderqueer. Also a ""somewhat effeminate dude."" I am absolutely in love with them. I've never felt this way about anyone before (and I've had intense infatuations in the past)--not a passionate lust kind of love, but caring so much about them that I want to spend the rest of my life with them. We relate on so many levels and have so much in common culturally/socially/etc.

I only started binding my chest about halfway through the relaysh (which has been maybe a year and half by now) and as I have become more comfortable with this person, I've presented as more and more nonbinary (I tend to present fairly feminine to people I haven't met because I'm afraid of judgment/rejection).

Yesterday it finally came out that my partner is really not physically attracted to me, and they said that it started when I started binding my chest. They said that as much as they'd like to find me attractive, they ""really only like girls"" and I'm too masculine for them.

Since I can't really pull off a super masculine look (I'm short, curvy, and dysphoric as fuck) I generally present as androgynous erring on the feminine side of things.  

This weekend I went to a big convention in a local city that tends to be pretty sexually themed.  I lost track of how many comments I got about my breast size.  I also had someone call me a lesbian because of my hair, which was weird because I was holding my boyfriend's hand at the time (I'm pansexual, but beside the point, being targeted as female made me feel weird, especially because his only apparent reason for doing so was because of my hairstyle and mens' shirt).  

Oh, and throw in the run-in we had with my boyfriend's ex (a pretty good-looking cis-male, kind of stung my pride) who has been extremely unpleasant to me in the past, without going into any long stories.  That was just the shitty icing on the shit cake.  My boyfriend of course understood why I was upset (how can a genderfluid faab who's gained lots of weight measure up against an attractive cis-male who was apparently good enough for like 5 years??) and reassured me that I'm enough for him... so I'm okay about that, but the whole experience definitely did NOT help with everything else being thrown at me all at once.

So my dysphoria was at kind of an all-time high.  Not a fun time.

Today, I was wandering around the vendors' area and someone stopped to tell me that he ""liked my style"".  I was sort of surprised (since when are jeans and goodwill-salvaged t-shirts a style?!) but thanked him and we started chatting.  At one point, he stopped himself halfway through a sentence and said ""Hey, what are your pronouns?"" 

He was just so open and natural with that question that it actually took me by surprise.  I actually had to ask him to repeat himself because I wasn't sure I'd heard him correctly!  And then of course I awkwardly stuttered my way through ""Oh, I'm fine with any, I'm not pronoun sensitive, but thank you so much for asking!"" and had to stare everywhere but at him until the tears went out from my eyes, but WOW that was a nice gesture from a total stranger.  I sent him a quick note later (I took a card!) to thank him for the kindness that really made my entire day and really soothed a lot of my frazzled nerves, as well as a few other kind words he had for me regarding my bust. 

His one simple question had me smiling the rest of the day and feeling MUCH more confident with my appearance.  A little consideration really does go a LONG way.

The former I finally got down a few months ago (I'm pansexual), though even early on I thought ""I kinda wanna temporarily go around as a woman.""

Recently a friend joked that I should crossdress, and then I thought ""it must be nice to look passing as female."" From then I've been thinking more and more about being female.

I've had quite a few autogynephilic fantasies, though when I'm a girl I find myself more attracted to men than anyone else (though plenty of women too).

Whenever I do think about being a girl I get kinda unhappy when I notice that I still have a male body, and kinda wish that sometimes my friends would see me as female.

However this isn't the universal feeling for me. Most of the time I'm perfectly comfortable as a male, don't mind presenting as male and don't mind my friends and family calling me male, but occasionally it just feels entirely out of place.

I'm a genderqueer person who often presents feminine, but the fact that I wear a fairly masculine uniform for my job and have short hair also lets me enjoy feeling manly/neutral on a regular basis.

On getting married: salespeople are constantly telling me how to look more beautiful/feminine/dainty--and the most gag-inducing: *virginal*--and it's more grating every time I hear it. My parents are also really invested in the pomp and circumstance, and that includes all the traditional heteronormative trappings (although their quest to feminize me is not new).

I'm okay with performing femininity, and I like wearing dresses sometimes. But I'm getting increasingly uncomfortable with everyone else's investment in my *ultra-feminine performance* instead of this actually being about an Important Life Decision.
