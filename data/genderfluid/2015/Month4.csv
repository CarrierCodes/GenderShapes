I'm a little nervous - I've not really had to carefully examine my gender binary assumptions before and I'm scared I'll say the wrong thing.

I would hate to inadvertently alienate a genderqueer friend/date.  I mean, it's unlikely that someone is going to say ""okay please describe your sexuality"", but I do want to have a clear way of thinking about this.

The reason I ask the title question is that I've challenged myself to run a serious, multi-faceted character in a campaign of Dungeons and Dragons, and I was really taken by the section in the Player's Handbook on Gender and Sex: 

&gt;You can play a male or female character without gaining
any special benefits or hindrances. Think about how
your character does or does not conform to the broader
culture’s expectations of sex, gender, and sexual
behavior. For example, a male drow cleric defies the
traditional gender divisions of drow society, which could
be a reason for your character to leave that society and
come to the surface.

&gt;You don’t need to be confined to binary notions of
sex and gender. The elf god Corellon Larethian is often
seen as androgynous or hermaphroditic, for example,
and some elves in the multiverse are made in Corellon’s
image. You could also play a female character who
presents herself as a man, a man who feels trapped in a
female body, or a bearded female dwarf who hates being
mistaken for a male. Likewise, your character’s sexual
orientation is for you to decide.

And so I thought, wouldn't it be interesting to explore the idea of gender as it relates to elves - a species created in the image of a deity whose gender is fluid and/or indeterminate?

And so I've been working really hard to make a character whose gender isn't unimportant (since gender is a huge part of each person's self-identity) but is not defined themself by their gender(s), but instead by personality, backstory, methods, and companions (the character is a noble, and as such can have three assistants follow them around to help).

And I've played the character in two sessions, and I've really enjoyed playing them, and I feel the genderfluidity is a subtle-but-important part of the character even though it hasn't factored into the game at all (since the character has identified as a male during the events of both sessions). 

But I asked a friend of mine (for whom non-binary gender identity is a big interest because they are genderqueer) for some resources that would allow me to better understand genderfluidity and thus portray the character better, and she said that she really took offense to my doing this (making the character) because it is oppressive and appropriates the genderfluid experience. She pointed out examples of this oppression in acting - primarily, that trans and other genderqueer people have not been permitted to portray trans and genderqueer people.

Now, I'll be completely honest - right now, I don't see how what I'm doing is oppressive or appropriating. I'm actively trying to treat genderfluidity realistically and as a whole aspect of the character, rather than just tacking it on because it sounds cool or funny, and I'm not stealing an acting job from a genderqueer person. Furthermore, my view on acting is that trying to get into the head of and portray to the best of your ability a character who is different from you is what acting is all about.

That said, I am a straight, white male, and from my involvement in supporting Feminism and LGBTQ rights I've learned that being a white, straight, guy means that you often don't see the problems and/or issues that arise around subjects like this.

your character does or does not conform to the broader

Please help as much as you can. I will be forever thankful. Feel free to write a huge comment or even comments telling your honest thought/tips/suggestions! :) I love long, very long helpful comments. 

Where could I shop online/in-person? What clothes should I get? What should I know about shopping for androgynous things......!??

What rings/bracelets/etc.. should I get???

What are some nice androgynous underwear? Are there even androgynous underwear.

Do you personally think I could personally pull off the androgynous look? I hope I dont look to boyish....... O_o

What should I know about androgynous style? Am I forgetting to ask anything?????????! 

How can I look 100% androgynous without surgery/hormones? :) Or atleast pretty androgynous. 

Please feel free to add anything else that you think I may want to know. 

:) &lt;3 :)

Hmmmmmm. My achne is slowly going away. My face used to be covered with achne, it is nearly gone!!! :) 

I may fix my lazy-eye someday. I got the money. I dont know though. Im starting to kinda like my lazy eye, I may just leave it. Im not worried about my eyes. They are big and blue and pretty I think. :D

I hate my current hair. Im excited to change it up next week. My hair texture is soft and wavey, I have my mom's hair.

I am 21 but I look younger than that. I look around 15-18 I think. I dont mind that. How can I play up my youthful looking body? That has to help me somehow. Maybe it will help me pull off a androgynous look..??? Lol.

I like indie old-fasioned old-soul hopeless-romantic type of fashion. How can I merge that with a androgynous look overall? 

I dont know what else to say. PLEASE feel free to ask me any questions if you got to. I may be forgetting to say something....? Lol, I hope not!!!!!

2015-04-29 05:48:11,348w1n,18,11,"So, yeah, I'm the person who [posted about wanting to make a serious, non-comic-relief genderfluid character for their D&amp;D group](http://www.reddit.com/r/genderfluid/comments/3370ij/rgenderfluid_how_do_you_feel_about_gnderfluid/), and after mulling the responses to that topic over in my mind, I've decided to give it a shot.

For those who didn't want to scroll through the wall of text in the link post, my character is a biologically female elf assassin and the youngest child of the head of a minor noble house (all of who are also assassins). I was inspired to play a non-cisgender elf character for two reasons: first, a passage in the D&amp;D rulebook on character sex and gender; specifically, it stated how the elf deity Corellon Larethian seems to have no set gender or sex - it changes depending on the versions of the legends - and sometimes is even written as hermaphroditic. It continued to say that some elves are made in the image of their deity, and I really liked the idea that the elves would view sex and gender differently than other species normally would, due to nature of their creator and their resulting relative lack of sexual dimorphism. 

The second reason I thought about playing a genderfluid character is because I'd challenged myself to play a character that wasn't just comic relief, one that I could take seriously, and I thought it could me if I made a certain aspect of that character something that I do take very seriously and couldn't bring myself to make light of - in this case, LGBTQ issues (of which I consider myself a supporter).

Anyway, I have a few questions I hoped I could get answered that might help me portray the gender-fluid part of my elf character better. If you think I'm not asking something that I should know, please feel free to mention it. 

Lastly, I want to make it clear that I'm not asking for a description of some overarching ""experience"" that is true of every genderfluid person. I just want to here your experience and what things were like for you as an individual. 

1. As far as I understand it, being genderfluid means that your gender (which is, of course, different than your biological sex) changes back and forth rather than being a fixed thing. How often does that change occur?

2. What is that change like? Does it happen over a period of time? Do you realise that it is happening? Or does it (and I hope I'm not being weird or insensitive here) change while you're asleep? I'm just trying to get an accurate view of when gender changes occur for genderfluid people and how it feels. 

3. What kind of personality changes occur when your gender changes? Do you feel more like a different person (not like ""multiple personality disorder"", just, is it a radical change to your personality) or do you still feel recognisably the same, but with some personality stuff?

4. How do you express your gender?

If you respond, it would be helpful (but certainly not necessary if you feel comfortable doing so) for you to put your physical sex in the response, just so I can get an idea of the different ways different sexes deal with genderfluidity and the body parts that may not match their gender at times. It's a practical thing - I like to draw my characters a lot, and figuring out mundane stuff like clothing and gear is important for me when it comes to portraying a character. In past cases, I've never had to deal with a female-sex character wanting to consistently and regularly appear as a man, so tips about that would be helpful. 

Again, if any of these questions are out of line, i'm really sorry, and I'd appreciate it if you could please politely but firmly let me know. And if there's anything else you think I should know so that I can accurately portray this aspect of the character, please mention it.
