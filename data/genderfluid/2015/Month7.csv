2015-07-01 00:01:12,3bp1bl,1,4,"Hi everyone! I'm a genderfluid AFAB and have decided to start writing a book about a genderfluid character with so little light shed on the subject in public literature and in any kind of publicity whatsoever... and I need your help.

Now, I obviously have my own experiences to go on, but I want more perspectives, voices, experiences, even horror stories if you feel comfortable sharing. This isn't autobiographical or biographical, it is completely fiction; however what you share could be used as inspiration for what happens to the character. I want to make it as fictional as possible but I will let you know if I will be using a situation that hits very close to what you shared with me to make sure that is okay.  The very last thing I want to do is plagiarize the lives of you beautiful people and make you feel like I used you. I would share bits and pieces as they come into completion in order to get feedback from the community to make sure I do a good job of representing who we are.  

Everyone would of course be credited in the preface of the piece even if it's just something I post online, whether you wish to mentioned as ""a lovely reddit contributor"", ""u/soandso"" or ""insertyournamehere"". Even if you want to remain completely anonymous I'm okay with that. If by some one in a billion chance I ever got published I would give you guys copies too. lol.  

I just want a deeper look into the life of a genderfluid person, beyond my closeted experiences to bring to light the problems we experience in romance, life, careers, friendships and more to really create a rich, emotional and even educational piece of writing for those who don't know what it means to be genderfluid.

So if you are interested, give me a PM.  If this garners enough interest, I'll set up an email account to receive your stories.  

Please send me your name (if you want, remember this can be COMPLETELY anonymous), age, where you live(could be as vague as a country or as specific as a city. I'm not a stalker, I just want to learn about experiences also as they relate to location) and then whatever you wish to share with me about your life as a Genderfluid person.  
Thank you so so much for reading and I'm sorry this is so long! I hope to be reading lots in the coming days and for anyone that submits I love you, and I wish I could give you a kitten.

**TL;DR Writing a book.  Tell me about your life as a genderfluid no matter how long or short it is to use for inspiration. You will be credited and thanked profusely.

Below is the text of the comment, unedited. I felt the need to make that comment after hearing the hypocritical nature in which he refers to things like dolls, truck, skirts, and such as ""stereotypical"" and also how he continued to treat gender dysphoria like body dysmorphia, a completely unrelated and dissimilar condition with a completely different treatment.

----

First of all, I do claim a faith in Jesus, and am familiar with the Bible, so I'm not an Atheist here, don't tell me I need Jesus, I accepted him over 15 years ago.

Second of all, I identify as a genderfluid person, that means that I have moments that I feel more feminine than masculine and vice versa. I was born male, but I don't feel I fully identify with the men I have encountered in my life and feel I identify more with the women I have encountered in my life. The name I was born and legally am is not the name attached to this profile.

If you want to call me out as just expressing myself a little more flexibly, then answer me, if I was presenting in a manner that it was obvious that I was a guy physically, but made up in a manner that women typically would (shaved legs in a pair of modest feminine cut shorts or skirt, women's style shirt, maybe light make up) and entered into your congregation looking to worship God and experience a Catholic mass, would I be welcomed in by you and your congregation?

If not, and if because I was dressed like a woman and should come back dressed like a man, then you are just perpetuating the problem by reinforcing those stereotypes you said were only stereotypes, not exclusive of being a man or woman. I don't want surgeries, I don't have a hatred of my body the way it is, I wish it could be a little different, but who is perfectly happy with their body anyway?

Also, a lot of the more emotional and social things you talked about, those were things that were (metaphorically) beat out of me, either by family or social circles. I have a difficult time expressing love to others because I never got to fully embrace who I am. I am not a strong willed independent man. I am not a physically active, physically accomplished man. I am more at home in a smaller group and being able to lean on others for support when I need it and giving back that support when others need it. I am more at home in groups where I can try to be more emotive and more creative, but that appears to not be groups that I, if I am seen as a man, can tend to be a part of.",genderfluid,My response to a Catholic video with a skewed idea of trans stuff,1436792562.0,"{'created_utc': 1436767362, 'id': '3d3j7n', 'num_comments': 4, 'score': 6, 'selftext': 'I hope the formatting comes out right on this.

2015-07-26 20:59:47,3ep2wt,2,4,"I will be cross-posting this on other trans/genderfulid/lgbt subreddits as well, the more help the better.

The Following is the first draft a letter coming out to my aunt, I am looking for advice on phrasing, ideas about other things to include (pm me if you want to know any details that help with this) grammatical help. 

And for context the bit about my mother, I was 19 or 20 and already adult, paying my own bills and paying rent to her (I did not rely on her at all other than that the rent was cheaper and I know possible roommates at the time)


(Insert Aunts Name), I really don’t know how to start this and I really apologize if this rambles, it is very hard to even think about discussing what I wish to tell you. But the following is a huge part of me and my life that I have tried my hardest to keep hidden, and hopefully it explains my hesitancy to do things with family/ my absolute need to move out last year.

	I guess starting way back at the beginning is the best way. As I am sure you are aware, I had been bullied and picked on most of my younger years for people perceiving me as gay and feminine, I couldn’t go a day without being called “faggot”, “homo”, “sissy” and those are just the least offensive things that I have been called in my life. People constantly tried to fight me, tear me down and threaten me, and this was to me at the time, unfounded and irrational and so I tried my hardest to deny those claims and things, and just ignored it, at the cost of my own happiness and self-discovery. Fast-forward to high school where I started to get an inkling of just who I was, but I still had this mental block due to the daily harassment I dealt with, I couldn’t allow myself to feel the things that I so freely do now. And top that all off with the anti-LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender) attitude I got from my mother, and I was just a total mess, I was confused, depressed, angry, and resentful of a lot of people and things, but mostly of myself, because I thought something was wrong with me. But in private I would try to explore my feelings and self.

I was very confused about my gender identity and sexuality, but I have come to terms with that in last 4-5 years, which is the biggest reason why it seems like I have dropped off the face of the family. To put it bluntly, I am Pansexual ( I am attracted to anyone, no matter what gender people self-identify as) as well as gender-fluid (meaning that I feel both like a male and a female, but more so one then the other on any day) and that means that when Identify as female, it’s the whole package, clothes, make, prosthetics, the whole works, which helps me deal with the amount of gender dysphoria I feel (not feeling like your body matches your brain). Now looking back at myself through all that stuff I dealt with and subconsciously suppressed, it all makes perfect sense.
Obviously I have tried my absolute hardest to keep this from being found out by family, though as of late I have cared less and less, but it’s still hard because here comes the reasons why I am terrified to be who I am to family. Starting with my mother, we fell apart because one day while I was out she “though something smelled like it was burning downstairs right under where my closet would be” so she decided to “check to make sure my closet was not on fire” (which is absolute crap, she has always snooped in my life. Always) So she goes in to find all my female clothes hanging up (ALL of them) in plain view in my closet (it was my closet which she had no need to ever go in, so why should I hide my things) she then proceeds to not only start seeing a therapist, but started telling her close friends, all this speculation about me (people that I had to see on a regular basis) and personal stuff. In addition to that she would borrow my laptop (which I let her do) and she would look through my face book (I didn’t log out because it was my computer, and normal people log out of other peoples stuff when its left up) at my posts, my pictures, my friends posts and pictures, she would look through things that I set as privet so only one or two people could see them. I have screen shots of GOOGLE searches she performed ON ME, using MY COMPUTER, things like “(Insert My Name), Gay” “(Insert My Name), Homosexual” etc....etc.… she also found my online diary for lack of better phrase, and the more and more she saw the more upset she would get.  
Finally she confronted me about it more than a MONTH after she saw those things and was seeing a shrink. This is where it gets especially cruel, She started constantly telling me she was praying for my soul and, that “she didn’t want me to go to hell”, or she would tell me that “this is wrong, you have a disorder, It’s not right” one time I went out presenting female, and heading to my friends for a birthday, actually feeling good about myself and She was sitting on the couch as I left and said “You know what you’re doing is a sin right?” She at one point forced me to see a therapist with her (under potential threat of getting kicked out) and the first one we saw, who was not a Christian, and was not immediately mortified by me and my identity and preferences, my mother said when we were done that we were never going back, she then found a “Nice Christian therapist” who was much more likely to agree with her. What it boils down to is that my mother still makes me feel like less than human with the things she says sometimes, and I can NEVER be myself around her, EVER. All I ever hear is “god loves you” and “hate the sin, not the sinner” She refuses to accept who and what I am. So add to that the messages about non straight sexual orientations that are taught at her church, and the occasionally offensive joke or statement made by (insert aunts family's names), you get the reason why I am almost never around. I would love nothing more than to be myself around those who are SUPPOSED to be there for me, but I can’t feel that way, instead the thought of presenting female around family makes my stomach turn and makes me feel like I am trash.

I am writing this to you because I want you to hear this from me, and not from your kids, or my mother.
I have dated and loved women, men, transgendered women, none of whom I ever brought around for fear of what might be said. And I identify as both a male and female, and prefer appropriate pronouns for which gender I am presenting, if I come over in a skirt and makeup with prosthesis’s in, then you better use she/her/hers, otherwise if it’s clear I am presenting male, he/him/His, is the way to go. 
I’d love to actually talk this out in person, but a letter works until I know where you stand.

I love you (Insert Aunts name), and I really, deeply hope that you can accept not only who I am, but also my reasons for how distant I have been in recent years.

If after reading this you still care, and want to talk to me about it, just give me a call and I will come over or meet you somewhere.

But the following is a huge part of me and my life that I have tried my hardest to keep hidden, and hopefully it explains my hesitancy to do things with family/ my absolute need to move out last year.\n\n\tI guess starting way back at the beginning is the best way. As I am sure you are aware, I had been bullied and picked on most of my younger years for people perceiving me as gay and feminine, I couldn’t go a day without being called “faggot”, “homo”, “sissy” and those are just the least offensive things that I have been called in my life. People constantly tried to fight me, tear me down and threaten me, and this was to me at the time, unfounded and irrational and so I tried my hardest to deny those claims and things, and just ignored it, at the cost of my own happiness and self-discovery. Fast-forward to high school where I started to get an inkling of just who I was, but I still had this mental block due to the daily harassment I dealt with, I couldn’t allow myself to feel the things that I so freely do now. And top that all off with the anti-LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender) attitude I got from my mother, and I was just a total mess, I was confused, depressed, angry, and resentful of a lot of people and things, but mostly of myself, because I thought something was wrong with me. But in private I would try to explore my feelings and self.\n\nI was very confused about my gender identity and sexuality, but I have come to terms with that in last 4-5 years, which is the biggest reason why it seems like I have dropped off the face of the family. To put it bluntly, I am Pansexual ( I am attracted to anyone, no matter what gender people self-identify as) as well as gender-fluid (meaning that I feel both like a male and a female, but more so one then the other on any day) and that means that when Identify as female, it’s the whole package, clothes, make, prosthetics, the whole works, which helps me deal with the amount of gender dysphoria I feel (not feeling like your body matches your brain). Now looking back at myself through all that stuff I dealt with and subconsciously suppressed, it all makes perfect sense.\nObviously I have tried my absolute hardest to keep this from being found out by family, though as of late I have cared less and less, but it’s still hard because here comes the reasons why I am terrified to be who I am to family. Starting with my mother, we fell apart because one day while I was out she “though something smelled like it was burning downstairs right under where my closet would be” so she decided to “check to make sure my closet was not on fire” (which is absolute crap, she has always snooped in my life.

2015-07-28 04:52:23,3ev2ct,8,5,"I posted here a while back asking if I was gender fluid. I've come to the conclusion that yes, I am. I have been searching for what I am and I think I finally found and answer that explains it. 

I am a male. I was born that way and I still am. You can refer to me as ""he"" or use other male pronouns. 

Sometimes, I have dsyphoria over my physical appearance. I wish I had a more feminine body shape and looks, and I desire to crossdress. These feels sort of wane and wax, changing in intensity or even vanishing. So far, there has been no pattern than I can identify, and it seems a bit random as to how I might feel at any given time. 

I don't ever experience any sense of being female or anything like that, and I haven't/don't desire to have breasts or get a sex change. I'm not fluid in terms of gender identity, I always experience a strong sense of having a male identity. I'm fluid only in terms of expression. In other words, I experience varrying forms of expression at different times. Does that make sense? 

For example, I was deeply dsyphoric for a few solid months. Then for about a week, I was totally fine and didn't have the desires to have a feminine body figure or crossdress at all. It just didn't seem appealing anymore. Recently the dsyphoria/desires have been coming back. It's like the tides, lol.  

So it does seem a bit lopsided. It seems like I desire a feminine expression more often.

I'm working on a segment all about genderqueerness and genderfluidity for tomorrow's episode of Woman's Hour on BBC Radio 4. We've got Dr Iggi Moon and singer-songwriter Ezra Furman coming on the show which should be exciting! 
I want to ask you all a few questions if that's okay.

Firstly what was it that made you start to think ‘actually I’m not just a boy or not just a girl'?

What difficulties have you faced in society as someone who doesn't wholly identify as male or female?

What do you think should be done to help people recognise that there are people in society who do not wholly identify as male or female?

What do you wish you knew when you started questioning your gender?

How do you respond to people who say that genderqueerness or genderfluidity is a non-issue and cast it off as 'just a phase'?

Do you have any desire to biologically alter your body?

Feel free to comment here or message me privately if you'd rather. I would greatly appreciate you also saying where in the world you are from and currently live although obviously don't say if you don't want to.

Then we talked about my fears of if I transitioned, and how I think my friends/family would react.\n\n\nTowards the end of the meeting, she said she was pretty sure I was transgendered. Due to the fact I have more than just the ""sexier"" clothes, that I have a name for this side of me, and that I feel uncomfortable with some parts of my body.\n\nI feel in some ways this is true, but in others, it isn\'t. I am content with my male self, but I also really enjoy my female self. And I am extremely worried about my future career if I did transition. And my future life. I feel like I could be either gender, or both. Could I get some input from the community to try and clear my head? I\'d really appreciate it!', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'What am I?
