2015-06-03 06:34:13,38c1t3,3,4,"I'm pretty sure this is just about the definition of a trigger warning, so... trigger warning. I've sorta figured out how to tell what gender I'm leaning more towards, and have taught myself how to push it one way or the other.  I think my record to go from mostly guy to mostly girl is about 30 seconds.  That one was more luck than anything though, it's usually about a minute or so.

Keep in mind this only works for *me*, I have no idea if it'll help anyone else :/

I think that should be far enough down for the trigger warning, yeah?

Ok, so I don't know if there's some *disclaimer* about *trying things*, etc, etc, not a psychologist, I'm just a guy who's trying to figure stuff out.  So whatever that disclaimer is, imagine that here :P

Spoiler: Pay attention to your legs

Setting (that's right, this takes some setup.  At least until I got better at it):
Dark room if possible.  Otherwise, as close to silence as possible.

Ok, that's the setup.  Well, that was easy.  Hopefully.

Grab a chair.  Sit comfortably in said chair.  No fancy collapsing into it all draped all over everything, just park your ass.  Hands resting comfortably on your lap or armrests or wherever, feet shoulder-width apart in front of you.  Don't pull out a ruler or whatever, just close-enough it.

Close your eyes, and take a deep breath.  And I'm talking a *proper* deep breath... breathe in through the nose, try to breathe deep from the diaphragm.  A full relaxing breath in, and gently let it out over a few seconds.  At this same time, just *DROP* your shoulders.

Whatever troubles were on your mind, whatever worries were rolling over and over again through your head, abandon ALL of that, and focus on this ONE action.  Sense where your shoulders are... probably all hunched up from worry and stress... and just drop them.  It might help to toss your hands out to the side to flop listlessly at your sides.

Hey, didn't that feel better?  Try to remember to do that more often, you'll feel more relaxed :)

So, whatcha thinkin' of?

Feminine stuff?  Masculine stuff?  You remembering that local sporting event you're going to attend?  You picturing yourself wearing that cute dress you just got recently?

What are your legs doing?  Pay attention to your legs now.  What would be a more comfortable way to sit?  Your body is in a constant state of trying to come up with a more ""comfy"" position to be in.  What would be more comfortable for your legs?  Do you want to splay them out, like you're sitting on the couch, watching UFC and destroying a bag of chips?  Or do you want to cross your legs, and watch the latest romcom that's actually funny.  Like Bridesmaids!  Oohh, and maybe do my nails :)

What do your legs wanna do?  Again, no psychologist, disclaimer, blah, blah, but I figure that if you wanna splay 'em open and take up more space, you're more guy.  If you wanna cross 'em and take up less space, you're more girl.

Wanna push it one way or the other?  Oh look another imaginary disclaimer about... something something, don't hurt yourself somehow :P

Take that deep breath, drop your shoulders, and manually splay your legs apart or cross them together.  Change the setting.  Have some Behemoth ready to play, or some Britney Spears.  Change your clothes.  I'm in an apartment, so I've got some freedom to try these things, sorry if a lot of this isn't a possibility for others :/

Aaaand yeah, of the random times I've tried pushing it one way or the other, and just paying specific attention certain details, I've been pretty good at swapping back and forth at will.  I think I went back and forth twice while typing this.  I generally attribute a lot of this to having suppressed it into my 30's, no idea if that's actually the case.

2015-06-09 14:16:12,395xko,5,5,"I always knew that I was not a typical girl. Incredibly tomboyish growing up, my family would tell me that I'd grow out of it, like the couple of aunts I have that were tomboys as children and incredibly feminine as adults. Except I'm almost 25 and still... me. 

I would say that growing up, I rejected the female stereotype completely. I never wore skirts or dresses, always wore baggy clothes, cut my hair shorter and shorter until I was just shaving my head. I didn't want to play with the other girls because they liked to play house. I found legos, video games, and power rangers waaay more interesting. The older I got, the more frustrated I'd get at my family imposing feminine things left and right. Make-up kits. Clothes I wouldn't wear in a million years. Attempting to fix my posture, walking, facial expressions, etc. They were trying to fit me in a box clearly not meant for me. 

As I've gotten older, there's been a shift in my perspective. I realized that I had a LOT of negative emotions associated with femininity that wasn't really deserved. I think somewhere along the way I realized I was being pretty anti-feminist by putting down my best friend for wanting to be more feminine. She, like a good friend, got all up in my face about it and motivated me to find a new perspective. I now understand that femininity is just as valid as masculinity.  And I let myself kinda flow in between my comfortable tomboyishness and a little more femininity.

The thing is, I act way more feminine than I perceive myself. I assume that I'm usually pretty gruff and straight to the point. I've taken to surveying people and most perceive me as fairly feminine these days. I don't know if it's purely personality but my hunch says it has a lot to do with my super curvy body, my grown out long curly hair and high voice. I used to hate those qualities about me but lately I just own them. I am what I have and what I think.

I've started to date a wonderfully honest trans woman and she has definitely rekindled the mystery of my own gender identity. She's typically more classically feminine which works great for her, but there's moments where I feel like she's treating me as a cis-gendered woman and I find myself in that weird place that feels not quite right. I have no body dysphoria whatsoever. I experience a great deal of social dysphoria, however. 

I've been in drag a couple of times, but it was just drag. it wasn't meant to be this moment of ""oh my god, I make an incredibly handsome man."" But it sure was. One night when no one was home I made myself a beard with make-up, put on a suit and tie and I was floored by how Amazing I looked. I've always looked more like my father than my mother and that was just... I was his grown-man-son in that moment. (a year later my dad subtly came out by mentioning his female name and months after that sent me a picture of him all dolled up. He still uses male pronouns and is closeted to everyone but me. Even weirder, we're both bisexual. I don't understand genetics. Anyways.)

Today I would say that I'm moderately feminine and moderately masculine and moderately something else altogether. So how do I present that to society? Physically i can look however i want, but when it comes to social dysphoria and explanations and labels and all that exhausting stuff I've admittedly been avoiding, what can I do?

Incredibly tomboyish growing up, my family would tell me that I\'d grow out of it, like the couple of aunts I have that were tomboys as children and incredibly feminine as adults.

I never wore skirts or dresses, always wore baggy clothes, cut my hair shorter and shorter until I was just shaving my head. I didn\'t want to play with the other girls because they liked to play house. I found legos, video games, and power rangers waaay more interesting. The older I got, the more frustrated I\'d get at my family imposing feminine things left and right. Make-up kits. Clothes I wouldn\'t wear in a million years. Attempting to fix my posture, walking, facial expressions, etc. They were trying to fit me in a box clearly not meant for me. \n\nAs I\'ve gotten older, there\'s been a shift in my perspective. I realized that I had a LOT of negative emotions associated with femininity that wasn\'t really deserved. I think somewhere along the way I realized I was being pretty anti-feminist by putting down my best friend for wanting to be more feminine. She, like a good friend, got all up in my face about it and motivated me to find a new perspective. I now understand that femininity is just as valid as masculinity.

2015-06-16 21:42:34,3a37yu,5,2,"Hey there! After simmering with the thought for about two years, I've discovered/ decided that I am gender fluid. 
Unfortunately, I still feel like I'm up river without a paddle at night. So please, if you have advice or maybe links to helpful websites that explain different paths, terms, and/or success story type things, that would be magnificent. Just help of any kind to help sift through my thoughts.

Feel free to stop reading now, I just want to share my story and vent. Hi, I'm 18 years old, and biologically female. I'm comfortable with that and I have no intrinsically motivated body dysphoria. I'm lucky to have small boobs that disappear in a sports bra. I'm very comfortable being biologically female and wouldn't have it any other way because I am literally a baby making machine and that is an amazingly special ability that I could never throw away. 
I enjoy being perceived as a delicate, beautiful female. But I also want to be seen as a handsome male by at least someone, it doesn't even have to be many people. But because I'm naturally feminine, no stranger is ever going to automatically assume I'm male without effort put in on my end to change my appearance. So, although I prefer long hair and a freshly made up face on myself, I've cut it short and stopped wearing makeup as often. I didn't recognize the true motivation behind my actions until after I did it. A few days ago, I realized I cut my hair because I reallyyyy like it when people mistake me for a guy. 

So it's not that I mind being a girl. I'm still very happy as one most days and I don't want to discourage people from seeing me as a beautiful woman. But I just want to open up the door for whoever wants, to see me as a handsome man as well. Then sometimes I feel strictly neither. I just don't know. 

I know this is truly how I feel and I should own it but I still feel conflicted, scared, weird, ashamed, etc. about my discovery because I'm easily influenced by the opinion of others and I feel like I'm just trying to complicate things. I haven't even told my family that I'm pansexual yet. I'm pretty sure my family wouldn't be angry at me if I told them everything, they would just think I'm confused and make fun of me in a way that's supposed to be loving but is really just hurtful.
I feel like no one is going to like me any more because they'll be attracted to one side of me but repelled by the other. Or, at least, I feel that people willing to accept my gender fluidity, and still want me in a romantic and sexual way, are going to be few and far between.

I should also throw in how amazingly blessed I am because my best friends are being nothing but supportive and loving. It was kind of just ""Yeah, you've been hinting at this. So what pronouns do you want to be called?"" I am so aware that so many people's problem is that they don't have a good support group and I am outrageously lucky to have best friends that will take news like that in stride and go with it like it's no big deal.

Recently I made the decision to become gender-fluid, switching between my male and female to whatever feels right. On top of that, I'm also a very burly build, so feeling feminine as my female counterpart on the outside can be troubling for me. I don't think it's dysphoria, though it might be a mild case of it.

This led me to the conclusion to turn to HRT Pills for Male to Female. I gladly sacrifice my manliness as my male self to bolster my femininity as my female self.

My wife has been very very supportive in my decision, but after me and her decided on whether I should use HRT Pills, (Which was a thumbs up) She brought up another issue that she broke down about.

I believe she is confused and upset about these two different sides of me. I've given my female side a name separate from my birth-named male side. So to personal reasons I have to stay like this. What's bugging my wife is the fact I talk about the opposite like a different individual, even though both sides of me are the same with the same memories and experiences. My male and female sides do not fight with one another.

The first way we've fought against these confusion for her is for me to stop saying things like ""Would you like to watch a movie with ""girl name"" tomorrow?"" or ""I don't know, though ""male name"" might want to."" and instead something along the lines of ""Well, if you want I can cuddle with you as ""girl name"" tomorrow.""

Though I still feel like something is bugging her. She seems okay with the HRT pills and even having intercourse with this new female side of me.

For my whole life up until this point, I'm assigned male at birth and have been comfortable living in a male body with a male identity.

I've never been into the stereotypical macho culture, and I've always gotten along better with women than with other guys, even though I have plenty of male friends.

2015-06-29 08:51:54,3bhpas,15,0,"I am a man but I wish that I had a girly body, things like less muscle mass, more curves, smooth and hairless skin, smaller shoulders, etc. But I don't desire breasts or a sex change. I also desire to present in a feminine way (cross-dressing, long hair, make-up, etc). 

I dislike my masculine body and presentation. I feel gross and unattractive looking this way.  

However, I do *not* desire to have breasts or a sex change. I consider myself a man.

So clearly I have some dysphoria about my body and presentation. What makes me think that I might be gender fluid is the fact that the dsyphoria seems to wax and wane. In other words, some days it's there but just kind of simmering in the background. Other times the dsyphoria is so strong I have panic attacks, cry hard, or suffer severe depression all day long.   

Would a change in the intensity of the dysphoria, rather than an actual change in genders, be enough to qualify for gender fluid?

2015-06-30 00:56:02,3bkro7,1,5,"Hello. I'm new to this sub and would like to introduce myself. I've just recently found out about gender fluidity and the like and its explained quite a lot of the way I've felt most of my life. I've always had moments where I feel feminine (, biologically male) and cross dress and do my mails. Before finding out about gender fluid, I always wondered if it was a sign I was actually trans, but the feelings kept waxing and waning, so I was confused. Then I talked to one of my girlfriends at the time about it and she told me she felt the same way sometimes and that it was called gender fluid. She helped me understand what i was feeling and even helped me pick a gender neutral name. I liked it and stated doing more research and it lead me here. 

So here I am now, trying to figure this whole thing out. One thing I need help with is the acronyms on this sub. Usually I can pretty accurately pick out what acronyms mean based off of context, but I'm failing on that respect with this sub. Also, I have quite manly features and would like some advice on timing since if those down on female days. Even when I shave and try makeup i still look obviously like a guy wearing makeup and girls cloths and it makes me sad. 

Anyway, thanks for sticking with the rant. Hello to all you wonderful people. I hope to become a regular poster here.

2015-06-30 17:24:40,3bnjid,6,4,"Hi, 

I know Ive posted here before looking for advice about my genderfluidity and dealing with dysphoria and such. At this point, I feel comfortable enough that I might want to start coming out. I want to come out online.  I really just dont want to be seen how Im not online anymore(which is being cisgender, not that there's a problem with being so) but I just dont want it assumed anymore and want to be more myself. I understand this is a big thing, that there are many bigots and transphobes and I may run into them,but I feel like that shouldn't stop me and that this is important for me and more representation for people like me. More importantly, I want to be able to speak for myself when discussing trans issues and such, rather than have other people talk for me and stay silent and just agree with what they're saying(something I dont really agree with, and having more and more a problem with) 

Do any of you have any advice on the best way to go about doing this or any tips? Im planning on doing this somewhat slowly, and trying not to make a huge deal of it even though it will be a huge deal to others.
