2015-10-06 22:22:01,3nrk7l,14,3,"I am AMAB, I recently realized that my gender identity is nonbinary. I started identifying as genderqueer (which I see as a broad umbrella term) because I see there as being something strange about my gender identity and the ""strangeness"" or ""queerness"" is the most tangible element of it, the only thing I feel I can pin down at this point.  But I also have been thinking about genderfluidity, both in terms of how much this is a part of my gender identity, and whether or not I'd want to identify as such.

Summary of my gender identity: I've never felt much attachment to being male and I've often wished I had the capacity to change my body between male and female (I remember having fantasies of this very early in life), and I've also often had the sense that if I had to choose I'd pick a female body. But I also feel very content with my body and I don't feel much dysphoria associated with it.  Most of my dysphoria or tension with gender has been with social interactions, i.e. I've felt super uncomfortable in most all-male spaces, especially when I was younger (I've gotten universally much more comfortable/content in life over the years), and often wanted to be ""one of the girls"" more than ""one of the guys"", and I've found I craved the sorts of interactions girls tend to have with each other more than the sort guys tend to.  From as young as I can remember I've wished I could wear certain ""feminine"" things without stigma, like dresses and skirts, certain colors or patterns, but others, like makeup or heels, have never appealed to me.  And some days I feel like a man and feel, in the moment, content with that identity, and feel like if I relax and express myself the way I really want to, I am well within the range of a ""typical guy"". Other days I feel like if I relax and express myself the way I want to, I almost surprise myself with how ""feminine"" my body language, way of speaking, and desires for self-expression become.  I usually censor myself from expressing my feminine side because of extensive socialization growing up, shaming boys for expressing feminine characteristics.  Because of this I don't have a sense of exactly how femininely I'd really want to express myself if I were able to express these things.  But recently, especially after embracing a non-binary identity privately, to myself, I found that I have started feeling a sort of harmony in my social interactions that I felt was missing for a long time.

I'm curious to hear from others...are any of you in my position, in that you identify with some other nonbinary identity (i.e. ""genderqueer"", ""nonbinary"", ""demigirl"", ""demiguy"", or something else?) but see genderfluidity as an important part of your identity?  And for those of you who identify as genderfluid, how did you decide to do so, and how did you come to embrace this label or choose it over other ones?

2015-10-13 09:09:43,3okcny,3,3,"I'm writing this mainly as a way getting my current headspace in writing, but also getting the thoughts of others who may be in similar situations.

Okay, for a while I have identified as genderfluid. My lengthy definition for it is that I am a person born with a typically male body that, at some point, developed an interest in some activities and clothing seen as typically girly. I also developed a more feminine self identity and sexuality, while still being sexually attracted to girls, I want to be a more feminine sexual partner, maybe not even using my penis at times.

While I don't mind being seen as a guy at times, there are times I wish I could be seen as a girl. That brings me to my current social status. Right now, with how I look on any given day, if you were to see me at a Walmart or the mall, you'd see a typical guy. I have an awfully thin spot on the top of my head for one thing, I have kinda thick eyebrows, more often than not are sporting some shadow, and typically am wearing jeans (either girls slimmer fitting jeans or semi-relaxed type guy type jeans) and a semi loose-fitting t-shirt. I partly dress and present like this because it's low maintenance, but also helps me not stick out in a typically more conservative area.

Now, as for the shadow, I have darker hair and paler skin, so I'd have to put a lot of work into that. That's not to mention having no idea where to truly begin on my brows and having to resort to the idea of using a wig. That adds a bit of work that I don't see myself wanting to do every time I just want to go to the store.

Now onto other aspects of my social status. I'm a Christian and regularly attend and am involved with a local church. While they seemingly are somewhat liberal, I'm not at a position right now where I want to test how they are in LGBT acceptance. I also see myself having a potential to do a lot there, so I'm not sure I would want to mess that up.

Now about how I reconcile my faith and my gender identity? Well, I do know about Deuteronomy 22:5 as well as the verses about homosexuality. I view them as correct, for their time. I don't view me wearing girls clothes as wrong because I'm not using it to trick people. I'm not sexually active, so I'm obviously not seeking to trick some guy into having sex with me, nor am I using it to defraud or trap someone. I also don't want to use it as a ""voyeur"" type thing or something where I cross the line into typically female only environments to just spy on girls.

If you can make sense of all this, great. I hate if seems like a long rambly thing with no clear end, but sometimes ADHD will do that to your writing.

She said that she identifies with the ""demigirl"" description, and that it sounds like I am the demiguy. I hate to water down my identity, but I think she's right; it feels accurate.    

What do you guys think of the image? I don't see anything too problematic with it.    

But however accurate the ""demiguy"" label feels, it does not very satisfying to me. The others, agender and genderqueer/fluid involve changing appearance, allowing me to experiment with what feels right.   
On the other hand, demiguy feels like something you'd only know about me if I told you (and why would you ask?).  

But it does fit, in an OCD way, with me also being demisexual.

To clarify, I am talking about recommendation letters for surgical castration (orchiectomy) for aspiring eunuchs who are not transgender. After all, while I myself clearly have some cross-gender feelings, I want to see if there are any more inclusive therapists in regards to this close to where I myself live. After all, I myself also strongly value surgical castration for sterilization purposes (considering that even vasectomies can and sometimes do fail and considering that we have a strict liability theory of sperm in regards to child support here in the U.S.).

Anyway, any thoughts on this?
