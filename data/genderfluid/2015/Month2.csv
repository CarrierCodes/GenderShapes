Hi, I'm DMAB, just turned 18 last month. I've had depression and anxiety for about 6ish years (idk might as well throw that in if it's important). Also please forgive me if I use some terms or say things wrong because I am new to all of this. For the last few months I've felt really... off? I realized a bit before reading/watching an anime/manga Hourou Musuko (which I really recommend) and reading/watching it helped me sort of figure out that most of the time (70%?) I feel ""male"", 10% I feel somewhere in the middle (but very confused), and then the other 20% definitely more ""female"". But I don't know if the ""male"" is just how I usually feel, not necessarily ""male"".

I'm just confused.

I am not necessarily upset with my current body, but I'm pretty hairy and have a strong jawline, so that's kind of ehh. I don't mind my genitals or whatnot. But sometimes I wish I could wear cute clothes (I'm really jealous of the options girls have for clothes), and I wish I could present as female and be female sometimes. I don't know.

I understand that I can be one or the other or both or neither. And I know I don't have to have a definitive answer to it.

I've only come out to two people (both of whom I only met like two weeks ago but they are both really cool and one is non-binary, so that help with making me feel more comfortable with telling them).

I feel like... how I currently am, presenting as male, I'm just okay with it. There are times when I know I would feel better as a girl and want to be a girl, but almost never I'm like ""YEAH LETS BE A DUDE"". I'm just okay with being born ""male"".

I’m really confused.

And i had someone who had told me that i was looking like a butch ( i think it's because some people  who have told me because i was wearing some guy clothes. I don't know if it's true or not but i like it :)

After i feel lot and lot more confortable about be with men clothes and act like a boy, even if i don't want to change my body  (even if sometimes i hate be a girl)

I Need some advice because since many yearts and it's recurrent, i have the desire to be a boy, sometimes i think i'm born in a not the good body, that i would have prefered to be a boy.
Because most of the time i hate be a girl for many things, and i don't have the desire to wear girls clothes or other things like this (sometimes i do exception).

Maybe take hormones yes.

But i need advice how i can be a boy when i'm a girl designed at birth and don't want to do operation (but want maybe to start hormone) and i don't think i want to open myself to a therapist.

This just barely came in, and I haven't got the time to dissect it right now.  What are all y'all's thoughts?

I've removed personally identifying stuff with what I think is most relevant in bold.

----------------------------

Dear REDACTED,

Thank you for contacting the Equality Advisory Support Service.

I understand that you wish to know what protection from discrimination the Equality Act 2010 provides for people in Scotland who are ‘gender fluid’ or ‘other non-binary gender’.

The Equality Advisory Support Service can provide you with general advice and guidance about the Equality Act 2010 but I must make you aware that we are unable to give any legal advice or opinions.  If you are considering any legal claim we would advise you seek advice from a qualified solicitor.

Protected Characteristics

The Equality Act 2010 protects a number of protected characteristics in England, Wales and Scotland.  Those characteristics include ‘sex’, ‘sexual orientation’ and ‘gender reassignment’.

**Reference to the protected characteristic of ‘sex’ under the act means physically being a ‘man’ or a ‘woman’.**

 ‘Sexual orientation’ means a person’s sexual orientation towards:

* People of the same sex as him or her (gay or lesbian);  
* People of the opposite sex from him or her (heterosexual);  
* People of both sexes (bisexual).  

‘Gender reassignment’ means as a person who has proposed, started or completed a process to change his or sex to the opposite sex. 

‘Fluid gender’ and ‘other non-binary gender’ are not specifically listed as protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 **and there has been no legal cases to date to test the court’s opinion on how a person who has a ‘fluid or other non-binary gender’ would be protected.** 

How a person is protected in each case is likely to vary depending on the type of discrimination itself.  For example:

a) A person who is biologically male but who is ‘fluid gender’ applies for a job in a women’s clothes store.  He is turned down for the job because he is biologically male.  This is likely to be considered as direct ‘sex’ discrimination.

b) A person who is ‘non-binary gender’ receives abusive remarks from a colleague who believes the person is ‘gay’.  The person doesn’t consider him or herself to be gay and is offended by the remarks.  This is likely to be considered as ‘sexual orientation related harassment’ which is unlawful discrimination under the Equality Act.

c) A person is biologically a women and considers herself as heterosexual and non-binary gender, decides to dress in male clothing.  She is told by her manager to go home to put a skirt on because all female staff are required to wear skirts as part of their uniform.  This could be considered as indirect ‘sex’ discrimination because the uniform policy is likely to be disadvantage more women than men and the individual has been disadvantaged. 

I hope that this information is useful to you.  For further information about the different protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 and prohibited discrimination you may wish to refer to our website at: www.equalityadvisorysupport.com.

Well, that's that.  Protection for genderfluid persons is not codified in law, and has yet to be tested in court.

This just barely came in, and I haven't got the time to dissect it right now.  What are all y'all's thoughts?\n\nI've removed personally identifying stuff with what I think is most relevant in bold.\n\n----------------------------\n\nDear REDACTED,\n\nThank you for contacting the Equality Advisory Support Service.\n\nI understand that you wish to know what protection from discrimination the Equality Act 2010 provides for people in Scotland who are ‘gender fluid’ or ‘other non-binary gender’.\n\nThe Equality Advisory Support Service can provide you with general advice and guidance about the Equality Act 2010 but I must make you aware that we are unable to give any legal advice or opinions.  If you are considering any legal claim we would advise you seek advice from a qualified solicitor.\n\nProtected Characteristics\n\nThe Equality Act 2010 protects a number of protected characteristics in England, Wales and Scotland.  Those characteristics include ‘sex’, ‘sexual orientation’ and ‘gender reassignment’.\n\n**Reference to the protected characteristic of ‘sex’ under the act means physically being a ‘man’ or a ‘woman’.**\n\n ‘Sexual orientation’ means a person’s sexual orientation towards:\n\n* People of the same sex as him or her (gay or lesbian);  \n* People of the opposite sex from him or her (heterosexual);  \n* People of both sexes (bisexual).  \n\n‘Gender reassignment’ means as a person who has proposed, started or completed a process to change his or sex to the opposite sex. \n\n‘Fluid gender’ and ‘other non-binary gender’ are not specifically listed as protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 **and there has been no legal cases to date to test the court’s opinion on how a person who has a ‘fluid or other non-binary gender’ would be protected.** \n\nHow a person is protected in each case is likely to vary depending on the type of discrimination itself.  For example:\n\na) A person who is biologically male but who is ‘fluid gender’ applies for a job in a women’s clothes store.  He is turned down for the job because he is biologically male.  This is likely to be considered as direct ‘sex’ discrimination.\n\nb) A person who is ‘non-binary gender’ receives abusive remarks from a colleague who believes the person is ‘gay’.  The person doesn’t consider him or herself to be gay and is offended by the remarks.  This is likely to be considered as ‘sexual orientation related harassment’ which is unlawful discrimination under the Equality Act.\n\nc) A person is biologically a women and considers herself as heterosexual and non-binary gender, decides to dress in male clothing.  She is told by her manager to go home to put a skirt on because all female staff are required to wear skirts as part of their uniform.  This could be considered as indirect ‘sex’ discrimination because the uniform policy is likely to be disadvantage more women than men and the individual has been disadvantaged. \n\nI hope that this information is useful to you.  For further information about the different protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 and prohibited discrimination you may wish to refer to our website at: www.equalityadvisorysupport.com.\n\nIf you have any further questions please do not hesitate to contact us, quoting your personal reference number: REDACTED\n\nRegards  \nREDACTED\n\n----------------------------\n\nWell, that's that.  Protection for genderfluid persons is not codified in law, and has yet to be tested in court.  There are actually no test cases to define what protections, if any outside of the realms of binary discrimination would be available.  Don't think the cited examples are wholly applicable, but they are what *has* been tested in court.
