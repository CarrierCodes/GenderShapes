I started researching gender a bit, and looking inward to see what best describes me, and with that I think I may be gender fluid, but I was wondering if what I've been experiencing is gender fluidity.

I'll just copy and paste something I recently posted to /r/asktransgender (I've been posting a bit there since I started questioning.) 

I've noticed that I spend usually about a quarter of my time feeling more feminine and about three quarters feeling more masculine, and it seems to be in a monthly cycle. I'll usually feel like a male for about 3 weeks, then for about a week I definitely feel feminine.

I think the reason that I've been feeling as if I was MTF transgender was because I was feeling extremely feminine and I kind of shifted to feeling more masculine. This confused me, but about 3 weeks later, I was feeling feminine again. Repeat cycle. 

Does this sound like gender fluid? I guess in the short and simple of it is that I'm trying to find the proper vocabulary to best describe myself even if it's just for me to know.

2015-08-07 02:59:24,3g33o8,20,7,"Hello peeps. I hope no one minds a wall of text. 

I'm a guy, if anyone asks me what gender/sex I am, I'll say straight away I'm a guy. I've always been like this. When I was a kid and for fun they dressed boys like girls in some events, just for some weird sort of fun. And I always hated it. I couldn't stand being looked at as a girl, it went against everything. I was a kid, with boy dreams, and boy everything.

When I hit puberty, things changed slightly: My sexuality obviously broke out, and with it some weird fantasies that clearly went against the norm of my gender, being submissive, weird kinks, having a rape fantasy (where I'm the victim). 

I didn't even think much of it, it didn't even cross my mind slightly that I could even be gay, I knew I was straight. 


And, guess what, things changed again: From 17 years my sexuality began to change once more, by change I'd say more stuff was added to it, nothing was discarded, but I gained some likes. I began to realize I always imagined myself as the girl while watching porn, or even just masturbating using the power of imagination. Obviously then I though the obvious, it was just a weird fetish. I looked it up and Ta daa, autogynephilia showed up and it perfectly described everything in my mind. Around this time I began having homossexual tendencies, I now had fixations with male genitalia. But not the male physique in general. I now consider myself as bisexual but that didn't come without some confusion of it's own.

So, now I'm 19, and for some months I began having thoughts of being a girl more than just sex. Being a girl in general, I still don't like make-up, female clothing (except panties). 

When I look into a mirror my feelings can only be described by cognitive dissonance. I look like a guy, I find myself hot, even though I'm probably not, and as 6' tall or 183 cm, non curvy body defined jawline and short hair, nothing about me says girly. When I look into the mirror I like what I see, I identify with that, but when I'm not looking into a mirror like a narcissist (you can tell by the hideously big post about myself) I think of myself as a girl, specially when I'm alone. It'd be a waste of my body changing to a girl specially considering as a trans I'd never look as good as I once did. I do feel like a guy these certain times, but most of the time when I'm alone reflecting I turn on girl mode.


I could go on talking about myself but I think this is enough. Am I bit genderfluid? Does one need to be born this way, when this is only a recent thing? Am I making shit up? I feel like I'm a poser compared to most real people here.

Also, my sister came out as non-binary, probably not relevant, but since we share alot of genes it could be I was aswell...

I'm a late 20's bio male. I experimented with guys sexually in my teens but decided it wasn't for me. Growing up, and even now, I would describe myself as somewhat eccentric. Overall, I'm a fairly masculine guy, lift weights, like sports, hunting, fishing, etc. However, I've always felt like i had this feminine side to me. I've always been jealous of the awesome clothes women get to wear, as well as the different hairstyles. Fashion wise, I mainly wear regular guy clothes, but some of the higher quality pieces in my wardrobe def have a bit of an androgynous flair. My speech can vary between masculine and feminine patterns. In video games, if a female character was an option, I would always choose it, and not in a sexual manner, I have just always preferred playing as female characters. With TV shows, I feel like I generally prefer strong female leads. Also did some minor cross dressing when I was a kid, but nothing post puberty. I've always chalked this up to just getting a higher hit of estrogen in the womb than most of my male peers.

Anyways, I just found out that my biological father, who died when I was young, was transsexual. Bit of a mindfuck to find that out to say the least. So I start to think that maybe this explains my feminine quirks, so I start reading about it. Read that transsexualism has something like a 62% heritability. Now, I'm not transsexual. I'm quite happy with my genitals the way they are, but all this reading led to to the idea of genderfluidity, which kind of seems like it fits. 

So while I definitely generally identify as a man, and I don't necessarily identify as a woman, I don't not identify as a woman either. Then I read an article like this: http://nonbinary.org/wiki/Genderfluid and I'm even more confused and like wtf. Furthermore, I have a lot of gay friends (no trans friends though), and it seems like this maybe would have come up before, but it didn't til I found out about my father.

So am I genderfluid, or just an occasionally effeminate man?

In video games, if a female character was an option, I would always choose it, and not in a sexual manner, I have just always preferred playing as female characters. With TV shows, I feel like I generally prefer strong female leads. Also did some minor cross dressing when I was a kid, but nothing post puberty. I've always chalked this up to just getting a higher hit of estrogen in the womb than most of my male peers.\n\nAnyways, I just found out that my biological father, who died when I was young, was transsexual. Bit of a mindfuck to find that out to say the least. So I start to think that maybe this explains my feminine quirks, so I start reading about it. Read that transsexualism has something like a 62% heritability. Now, I'm not transsexual. I'm quite happy with my genitals the way they are, but all this reading led to to the idea of genderfluidity, which kind of seems like it fits. \n\nSo while I definitely generally identify as a man, and I don't necessarily identify as a woman, I don't not identify as a woman either. Then I read an article like this: http://nonbinary.org/wiki/Genderfluid and I'm even more confused and like wtf. Furthermore, I have a lot of gay friends (no trans friends though), and it seems like this maybe would have come up before, but it didn't til I found out about my father.\n\nSo am I genderfluid, or just an occasionally effeminate man?\n\nThanks in advance."", 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'Am I genderfluid?', 'created': 1439298590.0}"

So I'm 21 and I'd like to think I'm pansexual, with a preference for men but I've only been involved with one girl so I wouldnt have enough experience to know for sure I guess...

I'm currently in a relationship with a straight guy who I feel is the love of my life. He's the kind of partner I've always dreamed about. He's very sweet natured, good listener, smart, and goofy. We've been together about 8 months. But he is completely heterosexual. &amp; I think it is this that is subconsciously holding me back from moving more into who I really am. He's told me he'd be fine with me dressing as male but that calling me his BF would be uncomfortable.

Actually, the title is a little too vague, of course, if you want to help you need some information about me, my father, and other thing !

I turned 20 yesterday and among other things, I promise to myself that this year I'll accept myself and live as I am.
I already comes out to some people ( family, friends, girlfriend ) some time ago but not my Father, I have cut the talking with him for a year now, but 1) If I want to live as I am, I must tell “everyone” about me 2) He will come one day, and I will have to face him.
Now, why not just said it to him ? Pretty simple, he's homophobic ( and of course transphobic ) and I know he will rage when he will learn ( but I don't fear him ).

2015-08-21 08:06:16,3htpc8,16,2,"So I just recently came to terms that I actually am genderfluid (fluidflux?). For the past few months identifying as non-binary, I knew that I was a bit fluid, but I thought that I was mostly just neutral enough that it was a non-issue, and that I could just ignore the slight fluctuations, do what made me comfortable and things wouldn't have to change.

I am mostly a very low-risk, mostly-static individual, and the fact that my gender changes is actually kind of distressing to me. Mostly because my dysphoria changes with it, along with my conception of my body, and self-image and I have to adapt. I have to come up with new coping mechanisms, which is hard, as I'd like to have stability and reliability in my life and how I experience things.

I come from a white conservative christian background, (so uh, warning, for internalized transphobia or whatever) and I still consider myself christian, so when reconciling this to my beliefs, I only want to except scientific biological kind of stuff as the basis for this. Not psychological stuff that I could 'resolve', or at least address somehow. (This is not targeted at anyone else, only myself, as I'm uniquely positioned to understand my own experiences and their effect, but not really anybody else's.)

I have formed and refined a rather complex theory on how my brain developed in terms of my gender and to a far lesser extent, my orientation (which is asexual):

1) According to what I understand of [this paper focusing on the development of sexual attraction,](http://homepage.univie.ac.at/Michael.Berger/lit/McClintock.pdf) the maturation of adrenal glands between 6-11 year-old children (roughly averaging around the time people are in 4th grade), leads to a release in almost identical amount of androgens in either sex (although this study omits mention of intersex children, so it may be different in their case). The author of this paper writes that ""[the 10-fold] increase in androgen levels alters the brain, and thus behavior, either by modifying neural function or by permanently altering cellular structure.""

I believe that during this time, my body or hormones did not perform the function observed in the above paper as they were supposed to, if at all. Although the only evidence I have for this is that I never in my life have experienced sexual attraction, and that around this time and onward, I had developed a increasingly divergent experiences and behavior than that of my peers. I believe that however my body experienced adrenarche differently, it obviously effected my brain development orientation-wise, and most probably my perception of my body-map, and thus ultimately my perception of my gender and self-image.

2) At gonadarche, or what is commonly thought to be the beginning of puberty, the brain is reshaped some more. Certain processes change under the influence of adrenal stress hormones, growth hormones, and sex hormones until the early 20s. I believe my biology continued to act atypically both in what is common for most adolescents in that stage, though slightly less so in ways that were common for my sex (female, I'm afab).

My evidence is as follows: I did go through puberty, (I have a very loose conception of what puberty involves, as no one ever really talked about it with me, and I am pretty much repulsed by the realities of anatomy. I also never took any form of sex-ed, so... uh, I may get some of this wrong.) and got my period just before Christmas vacation in 6th grade (I thought I was dying from kidney failure or something, I had no idea what a period was). Um. So for the first year or so, I had my period for around every 3 months, then for one year or so I had it about every month, then the next half-year I had it every 3-5 months or so, and then for most of high school until today, (I am currently 20, around 3 years out of highschool) I've had it once or twice every year or two, so basically I don't really have to deal with it (yay!).

Since my period is probably the most reliable indicator as to whether the right kind or amount of hormones are present or not, I think this is pretty good evidence that hormonally, I have been different, except for a small amount of time, from others of my sex. (I'm choosing to ignore growth hormone in this case, as I believe it has functioned normally during my body's maturation.) I also had my hormones tested once, during high-school, from an unrelated medical scare, and it seems that I have extremely low levels of both estrogen and progesterone, although they seem to be balanced with each other. Which probably explains why I've always been the most emotionally stable, devoid of drama, person in the room at any give time during highschool.

3) I have no idea if my natal brain formed differently , as I was not self-aware (obviously). I have not really studied how one may judge how one's brain maybe formed differently at birth anyway, so I can't speculate.

**TLDR; In conclusion, I believe that since my biology and hormones behaved differently during key times of my brain's formation and development, that even if one were to give me a standard amount of female hormones now, it would not change my body-map or gender identity, although it would alter my body's function (to align better with most cis-females) and possibly certain mental processes (though I believe it would in much the way that a bad code would effect a program, not well, glitchy).**

Also, since I realized that I haven't explained it before, I understand myself as having a body-map, which is different than, but informs, my self image and gender.

The body map is one's self-representation of one's own body, so my body-map when I'm female, is actually that of a non-puberty affected female though aged-up to my actual age, but this basically means no secondary sexual characteristics like no breasts, and not really functioning, um, plumbing and definitely no periods. Which sounds really weird or creepy or disturbing whenever I describe it, but, that's what it is. It's basically the same as when I'm a guy, though a slightly deeper more resonant voice, with more developed muscles of an adult, and with functioning plumbing, at least a prostate and phallus, but oddly enough, I don't miss having testes. The majority of the time though, I'm neutral, physically genderless, no sexual characteristics what-so-ever, if I had my way, I would eliminate all waste from the same source, like a bird. And there are more differences, but those pertain to what my body actually would be perceived as if my body matched my gender, what it seems to be in those moments.

What's really baffling me though, is differences that occur when experiencing different genders. Things that kind of seem stereotypical, or not related to sex:

Like, when I'm female, red seems to be more present, like more vivid, more noticeable and intense in some indefinable way, (I also seem to hate red, maybe because it's kind of grating to look at, when I'm female) does anyone else experience this? Seeing red more?

Also, and this seems stereotypical, but when female, chocolate seems much more satisfying. Not like I crave it more, but that it tastes deeper, just like it reaches down and feels more. It's more satisfying, I can't explain it. I also seem to like fresher, more 'healthy' vegetarian type food when I'm female, and some of my favorite foods when I'm other genders, I ignore because it's too greasy, or creamy or or something. (Although, while I don't really care for ice-cream when female, there is an amazing gelato place I know with astoundingly fresh flavors that I like.)

While neutral gender, I actually like red, and I like a lot of orange, or orange -analogous colors, and red isn't really that noticeable, just another color. I also like salty, fatty, savory, meaty, and creamy foods more when I'm neutral gender, like sharp cheeses, beef-fried rice, cheesecake, quiche, ice-cream, or fried eggs. I also really really really like cherries. I don't care for them when female, but when neutral, I can't get enough of them.

I seem to also only interested in cosmetics and scents while male or sometimes when neutral, but never when female; albiet only ones designed for men or unisex use (4voo, Anthony, Escentric Essences). Also I've only experienced arousal in male mode. I'm still asexual, I just get, um, blue balls (apparently vasoconstriction in afab bodies is a thing) because I have a stupid directionless libido that I can't even satisfy if I wanted to because that appendage doesn't exist on my body. Talk about frustrating.

On top of all this, I can be masculine, neutral, or feminine on top of my base gender. Which while even more confusing, (I KNOW I could never verbally explain all this) I just try to roll with it. And then there are just my basic behaviors and desires that are just part of my wonderfully smart, genuine, caring and quirky personality, that throws people at first but like once they get to know me it works triple-time to endear me to them.

All of this just is so complex, and confusing, and equally nice, because I'm finding that I enjoy things more, and take care of myself more, and I've realized, that while overweight, I'm not actually a slovenly slob obese person that looks ugly, and that I clean up quite nicely, I look pretty darn sharp or beautiful when I know how to see myself. Which is awesome! I actually really really like myself. 

But. All those that I love, if they knew would at best view me as, confused or deceived or threatening or mentally ill, and though it really tears me up inside, I understand why, a lot of times I get their opinion and I think I am too. Although my zucchini (ace relationships are freaking awesome) knows, and she's a conservative christian like I am, but she believes me! But it comes with qualifications, like not medically transitioning (which, I for the most part agree with, because I'm almost pathologically averse to modifying my body in any way, like even short term cosmetic stuff.) But what if my body decides to up it's hormones and I get periods? There is just something fundamentally wrong with that as a function of my body no matter what gender I am. Same with having boobs, though I'm more or less at peace with them. And she thinks that even though I experience gender differently, that since my birth sex is still a reality, how I was born... well, there's a lot of issues I have to work through in how they seemingly conflict with my beliefs and she shares a great deal of my beliefs. That's all I'll say for now on that as this is a gender sub, not a faith sub. Sorry :\

I realize that the reason I place so much emphasis about the biological reality behind my gender, my 'brain sex' is probably because that is the only way those around, me, those I love might be able to accept it, if they knew. Maybe it's the only way I can accept myself. I really hope I'm not making you folks feel bad. I just - this is one of the most difficult things I've had to deal with my whole life.

So I guess I just needed to get a lot of this off my chest, all this kind of stuff throws me for a loop, and I'd really like to hear your opinions and experiences. I'm also really interested if any of you experience differences between gender experiences that don't seem to be related to sex or gender in anyway you can see.",genderfluid,"Hey, I'm coming to terms with things, and I'd like opinions/discussion.

I have not really studied how one may judge how one\'s brain maybe formed differently at birth anyway, so I can\'t speculate.\n\n**TLDR; In conclusion, I believe that since my biology and hormones behaved differently during key times of my brain\'s formation and development, that even if one were to give me a standard amount of female hormones now, it would not change my body-map or gender identity, although it would alter my body\'s function (to align better with most cis-females) and possibly certain mental processes (though I believe it would in much the way that a bad code would effect a program, not well, glitchy).**\n\nAlso, since I realized that I haven\'t explained it before, I understand myself as having a body-map, which is different than, but informs, my self image and gender.\n\nThe body map is one\'s self-representation of one\'s own body, so my body-map when I\'m female, is actually that of a non-puberty affected female though aged-up to my actual age, but this basically means no secondary sexual characteristics like no breasts, and not really functioning, um, plumbing and definitely no periods. Which sounds really weird or creepy or disturbing whenever I describe it, but, that\'s what it is. It\'s basically the same as when I\'m a guy, though a slightly deeper more resonant voice, with more developed muscles of an adult, and with functioning plumbing, at least a prostate and phallus, but oddly enough, I don\'t miss having testes. The majority of the time though, I\'m neutral, physically genderless, no sexual characteristics what-so-ever, if I had my way, I would eliminate all waste from the same source, like a bird. And there are more differences, but those pertain to what my body actually would be perceived as if my body matched my gender, what it seems to be in those moments.\n\nWhat\'s really baffling me though, is differences that occur when experiencing different genders. Things that kind of seem stereotypical, or not related to sex:\n\nLike, when I\'m female, red seems to be more present, like more vivid, more noticeable and intense in some indefinable way, (I also seem to hate red, maybe because it\'s kind of grating to look at, when I\'m female) does anyone else experience this? Seeing red more?\n\nAlso, and this seems stereotypical, but when female, chocolate seems much more satisfying. Not like I crave it more, but that it tastes deeper, just like it reaches down and feels more. It\'s more satisfying, I can\'t explain it. I also seem to like fresher, more \'healthy\' vegetarian type food when I\'m female, and some of my favorite foods when I\'m other genders, I ignore because it\'s too greasy, or creamy or or something. (Although, while I don\'t really care for ice-cream when female, there is an amazing gelato place I know with astoundingly fresh flavors that I like.)\n\nWhile neutral gender, I actually like red, and I like a lot of orange, or orange -analogous colors, and red isn\'t really that noticeable, just another color. I also like salty, fatty, savory, meaty, and creamy foods more when I\'m neutral gender, like sharp cheeses, beef-fried rice, cheesecake, quiche, ice-cream, or fried eggs. I also really really really like cherries. I don\'t care for them when female, but when neutral, I can\'t get enough of them.\n\nI seem to also only interested in cosmetics and scents while male or sometimes when neutral, but never when female; albiet only ones designed for men or unisex use (4voo, Anthony, Escentric Essences). Also I\'ve only experienced arousal in male mode. I\'m still asexual, I just get, um, blue balls (apparently vasoconstriction in afab bodies is a thing) because I have a stupid directionless libido that I can\'t even satisfy if I wanted to because that appendage doesn\'t exist on my body. Talk about frustrating.\n\nOn top of all this, I can be masculine, neutral, or feminine on top of my base gender. Which while even more confusing, (I KNOW I could never verbally explain all this) I just try to roll with it. And then there are just my basic behaviors and desires that are just part of my wonderfully smart, genuine, caring and quirky personality, that throws people at first but like once they get to know me it works triple-time to endear me to them.\n\nAll of this just is so complex, and confusing, and equally nice, because I\'m finding that I enjoy things more, and take care of myself more, and I\'ve realized, that while overweight, I\'m not actually a slovenly slob obese person that looks ugly, and that I clean up quite nicely, I look pretty darn sharp or beautiful when I know how to see myself. Which is awesome! I actually really really like myself. \n\nBut. All those that I love, if they knew would at best view me as, confused or deceived or threatening or mentally ill, and though it really tears me up inside, I understand why, a lot of times I get their opinion and I think I am too. Although my zucchini (ace relationships are freaking awesome) knows, and she\'s a conservative christian like I am, but she believes me! But it comes with qualifications, like not medically transitioning (which, I for the most part agree with, because I\'m almost pathologically averse to modifying my body in any way, like even short term cosmetic stuff.) But what if my body decides to up it\'s hormones and I get periods? There is just something fundamentally wrong with that as a function of my body no matter what gender I am. Same with having boobs, though I\'m more or less at peace with them. And she thinks that even though I experience gender differently, that since my birth sex is still a reality, how I was born... well, there\'s a lot of issues I have to work through in how they seemingly conflict with my beliefs and she shares a great deal of my beliefs. That\'s all I\'ll say for now on that as this is a gender sub, not a faith sub. Sorry :\\\n\nI realize that the reason I place so much emphasis about the biological reality behind my gender, my \'brain sex\' is probably because that is the only way those around, me, those I love might be able to accept it, if they knew. Maybe it\'s the only way I can accept myself. I really hope I\'m not making you folks feel bad. I just - this is one of the most difficult things I\'ve had to deal with my whole life.\n\nSo I guess I just needed to get a lot of this off my chest, all this kind of stuff throws me for a loop, and I\'d really like to hear your opinions and experiences. I\'m also really interested if any of you experience differences between gender experiences that don\'t seem to be related to sex or gender in anyway you can see.', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': ""Hey, I'm coming to terms with things, and I'd like opinions/discussion.

I know I've got years ahead of me to figure it all out, but every now and again I think about it and it eats away at me for a few days until I can forget about it again. 

I'm a heavy tumblr user, so already there's a lot of influence from part of the community to grab at labels to make myself seem more interesting. I know for sure that I'm pansexual; my parents are aware that I'm in a relationship with a girl and nothing else. They're not homophobic, but they almost never talk about it and still sometimes refer to my girlfriend as just my friend. I'm fine with that; it's just not that big of a deal.

I knew what gender fluidity was from tumblr but never made the connection between that and my feelings until a few months ago. I'd stay up in my room late at night to bind my breasts with sports bras, wear my most boyish clothing, and hide my hair with a hat. I'd look in the mirror and be happy with what I saw. I still don't know if that means I was male in those moments, but I think he/him pronouns would have suited me better then. This only started a few months ago but it alleviated some kind of stress I didn't even know existed up until then.

When I figured out I might be genderfluid, I let the thought sit in the back of my mind for a few days before I really addressed it. I asked my mom in the car if it was alright to question my gender identity, and she gave me a speech about how I didn't even know what gender was at my age, how I shouldn't be focusing on that (and that I should be focusing more on school instead), and that I just wanted to have a quirky new label so I could be cool.
