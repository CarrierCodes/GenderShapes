I was unsure whether I should post this here or r/relationships, so I'm considering posting it in both with minor differences. I'll delete this if it does not belong.

I've been dating Olivia (fake name) for five months now, her coming out as gender fluid predates our relationship by about three months. She identifies by female pronouns and 95% of the time she feels feminine or female. She is very caring, supportive, and really fun to be around.

Recently, however, she has been feeling more masculine. Now I don't care about her dressing more masculine. Hell, I kinda enjoy a ""tomboy"" look. I myself am comfortable with who I am as a straight cis man, so I don't care what others think either. 

But as she has become more outwardly masculine in these past several days something has changed. She seems to be more aggressive, and less communicative. We normally have intellectual conversations, something I love about her, but recently she kept shutting me down and being short. I'm pretty sure she became upset because I called her cute (in my defense, we use this term back and forth). And, funnily enough, she seemed to revert to using overtly feminine descriptions (cute, adorable..etc) when describing me, as if placing herself as the more masculine partner.

I'm not vying for dominance myself here, and I'm not being paranoid, I can tell something is off. I feel as though her personality has changed and mind games are being played. Having spent time in a war zone as a non combatant and as someone who went through a lot of bullying,  I can identify these dominance signs well. I'm pretty sure there is no problems in the relationship otherwise, We have a date night planned so I'm considering bringing this up.

So my questions for you fine people are these: Do you feel personality shifts? Is this something I should get used to? Should i wait a few days to bring this up with her? In general how should I go about this? Does this sound like a gender related issue or something larger?

[Context.](https://www.reddit.com/r/genderfluid/comments/3rn8l0/a_1questionsurvey_on_genderfluidity/)

As for my theory, I'll just copy-paste what I sent to people who asked:

---

So you asked what my theory is. My theory is, essentially, that almost all genderfluid people exist within the following groups:

 * Agender/female
 * Agender/male
 * Female/nonbinary
 * Male/nonbinary
 * Agender/female/male/nonbinary

This would imply that the following groups are very rare:

 * Female/male
 * Agender/nonbinary
 * Agender/female/nonbinary
 * Agender/male/nonbinary
 * Female/nonbinary/male
 * Female/agender/male

Now, why did I suspect these patterns? Well... the first thing that made me suspect it is the highly controversial theory called the brainsex theory of gender identity. Basically, it asserts that people have a specific gender identity because brains are sexually dimorphic.

It does have some empirical support (see: digit ratios, BSTc), but to me it seemed incompatible with genderfluid people. (Not genderstatic nonbinary people: the brain might have ended up in an intermediate place between female/male.)

However, then I got an idea: what if a large number of people are agender/binary (i.e. agender/male or agender/female) genderfluid? This is plausible; [perhaps as much as 50% of all people are agender](https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2015/01/28/cis-by-default/), so maybe the same holds for fluidity?

Well, turns out it might! A survey I recently posted on an admittedly very statistically unrepresentative community found that [about a quarter were agender/binary fluid](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/3r9weq/glorious_glorious_data/). If this result holds, then the same logic that applied to nonbinary people also applies to genderfluid people.

Or does it? You see, the problem is that under the simplest models, the genders would be fluid independently, hence the categories I chose above. If this does not hold, there's good reason to be suspicious of the genderfluid-&gt;nonbinary reduction, though it doesn't immediately disprove it.

Of course, this doesn't directly solve the problem of fluidity being hard to reconcile with brainsex, but it does simplify the problem a lot.

My theory is, essentially, that almost all genderfluid people exist within the following groups:\n\n * Agender/female\n * Agender/male\n * Female/nonbinary\n * Male/nonbinary\n * Agender/female/male/nonbinary\n\nThis would imply that the following groups are very rare:\n\n * Female/male\n * Agender/nonbinary\n * Agender/female/nonbinary\n * Agender/male/nonbinary\n * Female/nonbinary/male\n * Female/agender/male\n\nNow, why did I suspect these patterns? Well... the first thing that made me suspect it is the highly controversial theory called the brainsex theory of gender identity. Basically, it asserts that people have a specific gender identity because brains are sexually dimorphic.\n\nIt does have some empirical support (see: digit ratios, BSTc), but to me it seemed incompatible with genderfluid people. (Not genderstatic nonbinary people: the brain might have ended up in an intermediate place between female/male.)\n\nHowever, then I got an idea: what if a large number of people are agender/binary (i.e. agender/male or agender/female) genderfluid? This is plausible; [perhaps as much as 50% of all people are agender](https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2015/01/28/cis-by-default/), so maybe the same holds for fluidity?\n\nWell, turns out it might! A survey I recently posted on an admittedly very statistically unrepresentative community found that [about a quarter were agender/binary fluid](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/3r9weq/glorious_glorious_data/). If this result holds, then the same logic that applied to nonbinary people also applies to genderfluid people.\n\nOr does it? You see, the problem is that under the simplest models, the genders would be fluid independently, hence the categories I chose above. If this does not hold, there's good reason to be suspicious of the genderfluid-&gt;nonbinary reduction, though it doesn't immediately disprove it.\n\nOf course, this doesn't directly solve the problem of fluidity being hard to reconcile with brainsex, but it does simplify the problem a lot.\n\n---\n\nIn the end, though, the data pretty strongly disproved my theory.

I've been identifying as genderfluid for several months now. That way, I was able to harmonize the much larger female aspect of my mind and the smaller male one. But recently, I've noticed that most, if not all, arguments towards being male at all are incredibly weak and based off of gender stereotypes. The only two arguments that remain are as follows:

1. After extended periods of female dress, I usually change into more neutral clothing.

2. If I had male-female free switching ability, I would likely spend at least some time male.

These arguments suggest that I am genderfluid. However, these arguments may not be nature but nurture- after having been raised male, I may be more used to being male than being female. If that is the case, I would be able to erase the male arguments through transitioning, proving that I was transgender all along.

So my question is, how much faith should I put in those arguments? Are they nature or nurture? Leading to the big question- am I MTF transgender or a mostly feminine genderfluid?

I shaved one side of my head (a first for me) and the other side is a short pixie/bob, and when I got home and started looking at it, I couldn't shake this feeling that there was something finally ""right"" about my hair, and that got me thinking. I've also started wearing a long wig some days, and at first I thought I liked it because my hair is thinning and I'm self conscious about it, but I think I like it more because I feel very feminine when I'm wearing it. I started thinking about Ruby Rose's video about her gender fluidity and it really struck me as very similar to how I see myself.

Some days I feel very feminine, and I like to wear my wig and put on makeup and wear dressier clothing, but some days I feel... not like nothing, but sort of neutral/androgynous?

I am FAAB. I am transitioning my body to be physically male, so part of me identifies as ftm. I am fully comfortable as being perceived as male at all times, and all the things that testosterone and top surgery will do to my body. I consider myself as a demiguy as an overall label. But my gender is also fluid. It fluctuates between male and agender most of the time, but sometimes I am a nonbinary gender as well. My gender is a fluid triangle with the three and degrees between them. I am fluid in my gender, but the reason I hesitate to call myself genderfluid is because I don't feel female. I never have felt female in my life. I feel like genderfluid encompasses all genders, or at the very least both the binary genders. I feel like I am not really fitting the mold.

2015-11-23 16:51:11,3tyk1h,8,7,"Figuring out my gender has been one big mess in my brain - what am I? As of recent, I've been bouncing around between a few ideas.

FtM: On my ""male days,"" I feel nothing but that, even hesitating to refer to myself as ""genderfluid."" But more often than not, when I am male, I am quite a feminine guy. So sometimes I feel like I'm just a feminine FtM. But then I question: what does that mean? Am I just a deluded female, for thinking I can have a feminine expression and biology but still claim a male identity? (That's how most of society makes me feel, anyway.) I mean, obviously there are feminine cis guys, so part of me knows that's silly, but that dark thought still pops up from time to time, especially after dealing with trans-unfriendly situations. Or maybe my male identity is just in flux, and it flows between masc, neutral, and femme?

Genderfluid: But sometimes it doesn't always feel that concrete. As of lately, my genderfluid identity has been allowing me to feel more comfortable expressing as female, though hesitantly, as though being ""female"" for a while erases all of my efforts to be seen as otherwise for the past decade. Especially when people use she/her when I'm dressed femininely, I want to correct them but feel like I'm making too big a fuss. Like, hey, I dressed like this, so I had it coming. (But ew, what an awful thought.) I use examples like Ruby Rose and Desire from The Sandman to explain to people, but when I'm expressing more femininely, it feels like a futile effort. 

Genderqueer: Or maybe I'm just genderqueer, and the idea of ""male"" and ""female"" is something I shouldn't/don't even bother with? I mean, what does it all mean anyway, things like ""male"" and ""female,"" if biology is irrelevant? Gender norms? Expression? And yet, interacting with society shows that gender IS important, and plays a significant role in social interactions. 

Cis: Sometimes when I'm juggling all these thoughts in my head, that dark voice from deep inside us whispers to me, ""You're just a silly girl playing pretend, making a big deal of things, unable to accept what you are - female."" Knowing other trans people, I know this isn't true, but sometimes, in the darkness, it's hard to convince myself of that. And it would certainly be easier to not resist a lot of efforts by others to classify and refer to me as female, though it would be painful. 

**Maybe the question is: what am I? Am I a feminine guy, does my gender change every day, or am I just completely queer of gender? Or maybe the question is: what does any of it all mean anyway?**
