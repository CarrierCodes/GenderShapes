Okay, so I started identifying as genderfluid almost a year ago after learning about it from a friend and at first I was really happy that I'd found something that described how I felt.

I'm a really young mom who finally figured out what this whole gender fluid thing was a few months ago. I was excited because I finally understood how I felt, but the fact that I have a family already makes this difficult for me.

My SO doesn't really understand it. I tried to explain it to him once, but he just kinda brushed it off and said I can dress how I want and that doesn't make me a boy. I didn't expect anything else, it was a surprise to me too. We're both bisexual so I think if he got used to the idea he wouldn't really be too upset about it. 

Anyway, my question has to do with my daughter. I don't want to confuse her with me changing my gender by the day, but I'm also tired of feeling like I'm the wrong gender for weeks and being able to do nothing about it. I'm still breastfeeding and living at home so a binder is pretty much out of the question for the next ~6 months anyways. 

I went off on a tangent. Anyways, I don't want to confuse my daughter or my SO with all this. Coming out just isn't my thing, I'm more of a ""ask and I'll tell you"" kind of person. How can I avoid confusing and scaring my family? (I'm 17, SO is 19, and daughter is 8 mos)

I've spent like the last year questioning my sexuality and now I realise after surpressing it and lying to myself that I'm bisexual...and also in someways genderqueer. 

I'm male bodied and I love by body. I mad on triathlon and I'm really satisfied with my body - tummy, face privates and all. However occasionally I feel I'm neither gender, agender. So my questions are: 

   **1)** Can I be genderqueer yet still feel 100% content with my physical appearance and not get dysphoria?  

   **2)** Also would the correct word to describe this switching between guy and agender (in fact is that even possible?!) be bigender or is that reserved for switching between boy and girl? Would genderfluid or genderqueer be okay labels too? 

  **3)** Finally, to save hassle of explaining sexuality properly to people I mainly just say I'm a boy and use he/his/him pronouns, is that alright or would it be better say I'm bigender or genderfluid or genderqueer?

I am 25 years old, 5'9, 235 lbs, cismale I think the term is? I honestly don't know how I grew breasts, but I have two theories. I think my gynecomastia started when I became overweight around 19 years old, just over six years ago. I had an appendectomy. I was exhausted and stopped exercising, I assumed it was postoperative fatigue, trauma of an invasive operation and overeating after I recovered. I don't exercise anymore. I was near 300 at one point but that was from strict dieting. I'm comfortable with my weight at this point.
I also have been taking Casodex daily for the last four years to prevent male pattern baldness. I did this under an endocrinologist's care. I knew of the drug's potentially feminizing side-effects, but I felt immense relief to not go bald. Over the past 4 years, I've grown breasts of 36D bra size and they appear identically female, with ducts and enlarged areoles. They don't bother me at all.


As of the last six or seven months or so, people repeatedly ask me if im a girl because I have long hair and boobs and a very feminine looking body and fat pattern. I mean its a daily thing whenever I go out. I shave my face so maybe that is a reason? I decided to crossdress a few months ago just once to see if I really do look female. I got pantyhose, a long dress, panties, bra and women's flats and tied my hair back. I took a photo and posted on social media ""Do I really look better as a woman like everyone says?"" It was an overwhelming yes, dozens of likes. People kept asking if I was transgender and I didn't know what that meant then. For the past few months I been thinking over and over why do I look feminine physically and maybe if I should live full time as a woman and identify as a woman. I would be the exact same person, still be a homebody and a gamer but just living as a female and I don't have any problem with that. My own mother thinks I look like a woman at this point with male clothes.


I have had a decent childhood, father passed young, have a good, open and tolerant family, used to be athletic but after i stopped working out I became a coder and gamer and enjoy both very much. I've never thought of being a female before, never wanted to be before, don't hate or dislike my genitals, never crossdressed while young, content with life, never was suicidal, usually just wear shorts and long t-shirts. I don't mean to offend with anything I am saying but just putting my personal situation out there. What does this mean? Has anyone here felt the same? I was also advised that about the binary or lack thereof and there are people out there who some days ""feel"" like a man and other days wake up ""feeling"" like a woman. That also appeals in a way to do as I please.

2015-01-16 08:34:01,2sm1ck,2,6,"I'm going to apologize now because I know this post is probably going to end up being long. Anyway, I guess I'll start by saying that there have been a lot of recent changes in my life--the main one being my deconversion from Christianity. I grew up in a household with two Christian parents. My dad doesn't talk about his religious beliefs much, but my mother is a total fundie. Four years ago, I started on the journey that led to me becoming an atheist. I have been an atheist for two years now.

Since that change, I have had to question a lot of my moral and ethical beliefs. My world was essentially turned upside down. I kinda of feel like I lived in a bubble for most of my life, and now I'm finally free to actually figure out who I am. 

Something that occurred to me in the last month is that, even though I have always identified as a cisgender female, I have never in my life felt like one. When I was a child I played with toys that boys typically played with. I hated girls clothing. I preferred playing with boys outside in the dirt than playing inside with barbies like the rest of the little girls my age. As a teenager, none of that really changed. I was pretty miserable throughout middle school and high school... never feeling like I fit in anywhere or with anyone. 

I think the reason I never questioned how I truly felt about a lot of things was because I had it stuck in my head that I needed to be a ""good little Christian girl"" who her parents could be proud of. It didn't matter how I felt-- it mattered how everyone else felt about me. I wanted desperately to fit in, and to feel like I belonged somewhere. 

Now that I'm in my mid/late twenties, I feel like I can be honest with myself for the first time; I'm no longer trying to fit into a mold that doesn't work for me. That being said, I'm able to admit to myself that I almost never feel feminine. In fact, I'm not sure I ever have. Most of the time, I don't feel like I'm male or female... just someone who floats somewhere in between. Other times, I most definitely feel male.

Typically when I'm in the presence of men, I don't feel feminine or masculine. It's a little different when I'm in the presence of men who come off as total creepers though-- like I'm suddenly more aware of my biological gender or something. When a guy hits on me and his advances aren't welcomed, I feel weak and small and anxious.... and I guess a little of something that might be considered feminine? I don't even know. 

When I'm around other women... I DEFINITELY don't feel feminine, or like a woman. I feel masculine and just horribly horribly awkward. I also feel obligated to do things like pay for things they want, open doors for them, and become oddly protective of them. I don't understand it, but I think my awkwardness around other women has cost me almost every friendship that I've had with them. No female has ever explicitly stated that I seem weird around other girls, or that they feel weird around me. Usually my female friends just kind of drift away, without there ever being a clear reason as to why. 

I know that I am sexually attracted to men, however becoming emotionally attracted to a man is rare. I know also that I am very emotionally attracted to women, however I can't say for sure whether or not I'm physically attracted to them.  I have no experience with that kind of thing. I don't even know any people that identify as something other than the gender they were assigned at birth.

If I could have been born male, I probably would have chosen that option... but as of right now, I don't have a desire to change my appearance or sex organs. I am fine with who I am physically... I just don't really understand everything else that's going on in my head. I know the reasons why I have ignored these thoughts and feelings for so long, but the drastic change in my ways of thinking in the last few years has left me a little overwhelmed by it all. 

These feelings I have are not something I really feel comfortable sharing with anyone that I know in person, so I figured I might be able to get some feedback from complete strangers xD. Have any of you had similar feelings? If so, how have you managed to cope with them? Is there a gender I seem to identify most with? I seem to think genderfluid fits me the best... but I'm honestly not sure. Also, do you perhaps know of some things I should read so that I could better understand who I am in terms of gender? Thanks for reading!

Anyway, I guess I\'ll start by saying that there have been a lot of recent changes in my life--the main one being my deconversion from Christianity. I grew up in a household with two Christian parents. My dad doesn\'t talk about his religious beliefs much, but my mother is a total fundie. Four years ago, I started on the journey that led to me becoming an atheist. I have been an atheist for two years now.\n\nSince that change, I have had to question a lot of my moral and ethical beliefs. My world was essentially turned upside down. I kinda of feel like I lived in a bubble for most of my life, and now I\'m finally free to actually figure out who I am. \n\nSomething that occurred to me in the last month is that, even though I have always identified as a cisgender female, I have never in my life felt like one. When I was a child I played with toys that boys typically played with. I hated girls clothing. I preferred playing with boys outside in the dirt than playing inside with barbies like the rest of the little girls my age. As a teenager, none of that really changed. I was pretty miserable throughout middle school and high school... never feeling like I fit in anywhere or with anyone. \n\nI think the reason I never questioned how I truly felt about a lot of things was because I had it stuck in my head that I needed to be a ""good little Christian girl"" who her parents could be proud of. It didn\'t matter how I felt-- it mattered how everyone else felt about me. I wanted desperately to fit in, and to feel like I belonged somewhere. \n\nNow that I\'m in my mid/late twenties, I feel like I can be honest with myself for the first time; I\'m no longer trying to fit into a mold that doesn\'t work for me. That being said, I\'m able to admit to myself that I almost never feel feminine. In fact, I\'m not sure I ever have. Most of the time, I don\'t feel like I\'m male or female... just someone who floats somewhere in between. Other times, I most definitely feel male.\n\nTypically when I\'m in the presence of men, I don\'t feel feminine or masculine. It\'s a little different when I\'m in the presence of men who come off as total creepers though-- like I\'m suddenly more aware of my biological gender or something. When a guy hits on me and his advances aren\'t welcomed, I feel weak and small and anxious.... and I guess a little of something that might be considered feminine? I don\'t even know. \n\nWhen I\'m around other women... I DEFINITELY don\'t feel feminine, or like a woman. I feel masculine and just horribly horribly awkward. I also feel obligated to do things like pay for things they want, open doors for them, and become oddly protective of them. I don\'t understand it, but I think my awkwardness around other women has cost me almost every friendship that I\'ve had with them. No female has ever explicitly stated that I seem weird around other girls, or that they feel weird around me. Usually my female friends just kind of drift away, without there ever being a clear reason as to why. \n\nI know that I am sexually attracted to men, however becoming emotionally attracted to a man is rare. I know also that I am very emotionally attracted to women, however I can\'t say for sure whether or not I\'m physically attracted to them.  I have no experience with that kind of thing. I don\'t even know any people that identify as something other than the gender they were assigned at birth.\n\nIf I could have been born male, I probably would have chosen that option... but as of right now, I don\'t have a desire to change my appearance or sex organs. I am fine with who I am physically... I just don\'t really understand everything else that\'s going on in my head. I know the reasons why I have ignored these thoughts and feelings for so long, but the drastic change in my ways of thinking in the last few years has left me a little overwhelmed by it all. \n\nThese feelings I have are not something I really feel comfortable sharing with anyone that I know in person, so I figured I might be able to get some feedback from complete strangers xD.

The purpose for my study is to document a deeper understanding of gender fluid identity and expression . Ultimately my goal is to examine and show the ambiguous relationship between gender and sex. I am currently searching for people who identify as gender fluid to participate in this study. The study will minimally require a 20-45 minutes interview that will address some of the following topics: what it means to be gender fluid, your realization of your gender identity, gender misinterpretation, and so forth. These interviews will be conducted via Skype, so having a Skype account will be necessary. Although I would prefer to audio record these interviews, I completely understand if you are uncomfortable with that. Therefore, having your interview recorded is optional. These recordings will be transcribed for analytical and citational purposes.
In addition, you may choose to participate in field observations if you are in the West Coast of the United States. Field observations will involve you being observed interacting with others for no more than two hours. The purpose for these field observations is to understand how you express your gender among others. Field observations are entirely optional, therefore you may choose to only do the interview for this study. Please note that you will be required to sign a consent form before participating.

2015-01-18 03:32:16,2ssrio,4,5,"Hey, so I literally just found out about genderfluidity and it *perfectly* describes how I feel. My normal day to day life is very happily male, but for the longest time it feels like 20% of me has always wanted to be a girl. I always feel like I am missing out on something but not being able to live some of my life as a girl. Since I was little I have always felt kind of like this and I even have acted upon the feelings quite a few times and dressed up when in private (rather decently I think!). It's not something I'd want permanently, but just something I wish I could live as a girl from time to time.

So knowing that being genderfluid is a thing makes me happy, it's nice that there are other people like me! How do you all deal with feeling like this? I *really* wish I could sometimes just walk outside one day in girl mode and not have anyone question it. Like I want to try things like shaving my legs, growing my hair out, putting on makeup, but I just feel like it will disrupt my normal social life so much. I've considered traveling to a distant area for a vacation sort of thing where I spend a week or so living as a girl, but idk. Living the other side has just almost always felt like a fantasy and never something that could be reality, especially when trying to maintain my normal male social life.

So what do you all do to express yourself as the other gender despite how your friends/social circle perceive you?

I am a female and like it.. well sometimes... I recently had a dream of what it would be like to be a male, specifically having a penis and I got really excited about it.

I am taking a Sociology class and we spoke a lot about masculinity and this just made the timing perfect.

I have a wonderful wife who knows..NOTHING about these feelings and it's something I will probably hide forever.

I've gone through five different names before settling on my birth name but now I'm considering a different name again as well as feeling more dysphoria but I'm stressed about it because I feel like I'm just gonna go back to my birth name after a little while. 
It all keeps fluctuating so much. The name changes, the different amounts of dysphoria that changes all the time. Some nights I feel like just buzzing my head because my hair causes me dysphoria! Other nights I wish I had long flowing hair to my waist, it's so confusing.
Does anyone else have this problem of having so much change? How do you deal with it? Because I'm having so much trouble with the stress of it all that it's affecting my mental health.

After about 6 weeks of changing it up every few days till I felt I was comfortable, I finally ended up with transgender, non-binary, and genderfluid (in that order).

So far I haven't had any outright hateful/ grossly rude messages (pertaining to my gender anyway), although a crapton of microaggressions and general PC faux-pas. Twice I have gone back to simply ""woman"" out of aggravation and simply wanting to get more messages. [Note: Totally not worth it]

This isn't really a ""Should I publicly identify"", I have finally decided to leave my profile the way it is.

Dressing as a female or a male on a certain day is often relegated to how lazy I am feeling, or what I need to get done that day.

So.....I don't feel like a woman trapped in a mans body, I don't suffer from dysphoria, but all the same, I do wish to augment my body to better accomodate switching between gender expressions. In a nutshell....I want breasts. So i've been looking to get a prescription for some anti androgens and estrogen. Now, where I live, I need to talk to a mental health person and basically get a slip of paper saying I have some kind of gender identity majigger to present to a doctor in order to be prescribed the hormones.

Thing is....i'm kind of worried i'm going to have to lie my ass off to get this slip of paper.
