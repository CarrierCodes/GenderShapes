So question one, are there Gender Fluids the feel the need to pack or do?

Question two, if I am packing, feel the need to pack maybe I dont fit under the gender fluid title?

&amp;nbsp;


Some days? Yeah I feel like a guy and everything feels great. I feel confident and can walk around dressed as a guy like I normally am. Other days? I feel super feminine, envious of other womens curves and what they get to wear. Some days it goes so far that I can't stand my male genitals but again, it changes from time to time (obviously).  
&amp;nbsp;

Now I am not short or androgynous by any means. I'm tall, 6'7 to be exact, and have a strong build; the world dictates that I act like a guy and be masculine, moreso because of this. And really I HATE it. I wish I was shorter and slimmer, shorter moreso, so that I could realistically pass when I feel female and such but thats not the case. Part of me feels like Im trying to suppress it, hoping that it'll eventually go away (I know it wont, lets be realistic here) or I'll change because even passing as female is totally impossible.

I'm out to one friend of mine right now. I don't see her often but shes really involved and accepting in this kind of thing.

You know, acting like it doesnt matter, being passive or whatever to avoid some sort of embarrassment. It's habit by this point because embarrassment terrifies me and I've always worked to avoid that.

&amp;nbsp;

How do I deal with my shifting gender at my height and build? I am fine when I am male, but when female it seems hopeless. I want to feel comfortable whether im a girl or a guy.

2015-03-22 07:04:04,2zvvg8,0,0,"Hello everyone! I am a 29 year old dominant bi sexual male. I do, however, have slight switch tendencies from time to time but dominant even in those situations as well. I am looking for a either submissive females or submissive males (including feminine boys.) I'm looking for something specific; a sequence of events that lead to an intriguing RP(however what I primarily seek lies along the realm of just a submissive partner in general.) Keep in mind, I am looking for before hand planning(""Porn Hunting"") for inspiration. Consists of the submissive listening to my desires and helping me to find pornographic images, similar to my wants/kinks, as well as theirs and also to inspire an RP moment. I have a passion for details both about myself and about others, so I love to know clothes details, bodily details, make up etc. Role Play may be anything and everything, so any other ideas you may have feel free to come to me with, along with pictures. However what I primarily seek and have a special place for is: Transformation Gender Play but other than that I am open minded to all types of sexual situations of course. If this is your cup of tea, read forward. 

I am seeking a scene that revolves around two male best friends; roommates. What happens is that one of us(or both of us) magically transforms from male to female. The twist is that the transformation is not triggered by some sort of magical potion, but it is triggered on our own guilty pleasure: Viewing porn pictures. It's a bit of a interactive twist that I want to try; incorporating porn pictures in the mix and actually looking at them together. Furthermore, the point of this ""porn hunting"" is that it will also help you see what I look for as well. The progression of how we ""bro out"" to porn is first by gawking at and literally picking the pictures apart and then slowly gradually noticing things in the porn that make us both realize in ""self discovery/epitome fashion"" together that ""hey, maybe being a chick is a sweet deal."" In other words, the appeal of power and money (free drinks, club life etc) is what ""tricks us""....That will be how we justify wanting to be a chick without sounding ""gay"" so to speak. It's a bit of a mix between orientation play, denial and simply a ""twisted bromance."" Also, one thing to take note is the manipulation flow. The ""vexed porn"" will poison your mind with this self-discovery first and then the way it will infect my mind is by you ""selling/manipulating"" the idea you just discovered and preach it to me as you porn hunt.

As I mentioned before, what I want us to have initially is a ""bromance/jock"" type of dynamic together. What that means is, I want more of a laid back conversation flow/style; I believe the slang term is ""chat speak."" I know it seems a bit rudimentary but oddly it is something that pleases me(I don't usually talk this way in real life.) I want there to be more of a laid back style of talking with one another; call each other ""bro, dude, man."" I want us to make jokes with each other, laugh, say lol. I want there to be also a hint of orientation banter/homoerotic jokes even borderline flirtation but in a denial sort of sense(if that makes ANY sense lol.) Don't be TOO much of an ass or be too mean. Remember we are best friends. Show some sense of warmth. Now, in terms of what I want you to pay attention for when we ""gawk at bitches"" so to speak is that I want you to verbally gawk at the women with me; pick apart the photo, describe the photo and what you enjoy in colorful ""eye candy"" detail. I don't mean just to say ""check those legs and heels on that babe"" but instead describe the heels, what color heels, what kind, and how her legs look, the skin tone etc. Also, keep in mind if I zone in on a specific part of the pic that is your cue to describe specifically that part with me. I want you to describe the pic as if it is not in front of us, pick apart and visualize the photo of what you enjoy(and even dislike) in true ""bro"" fashion. It's a way for you to not only learn my tastes but also to get into the style of inadvertently pleasing your ""bud"" with our ""circle jerk"" sort of porn session. Think of it also as an interactive approach to training you to learn my tastes and wants as potentially my switch/submissive.

In terms of ""kinks"" and ""fetishes"" I would have to say it's ever evolving and quite an open book. However as of right now, my interests are: orgasm control/edging/teasing/denial, roleplay writing(obviously lol) and most importantly just the mental aspect of being dominant and in control. What I mean by ""mental aspect"" of control I mean I'm not going to pound my chest and be like ""Me Joshua, you be my bitch"" because that is obviously not me and in poor taste on my part. I just wanted to make it known that's what I am intrigued in. However, for me, I don't particularly believe being dominant is all about the physical side of being dominant. To me it's far more deeper and on a more mental level than just say ""tying someone up."" Don't get me wrong I have nothing against doing that either but you get my drift. On a side note, in terms of ""vanilla"" kinks, I do have a huge weakness for legs(high heels, stockings, etc) and eyes. Consider my ""legs and eyes"" as my ""tits and ass"" that most typical men gawk at. And lastly, the more simplest kink would be my addiction to porn photos on the web(pictures.) I may be a romantic type but I am a guy after all; all men have this addiction regardless lol

I am a 29 year old dominant bi sexual male. I do, however, have slight switch tendencies from time to time but dominant even in those situations as well. I am looking for a either submissive females or submissive males (including feminine boys.) I\'m looking for something specific; a sequence of events that lead to an intriguing RP(however what I primarily seek lies along the realm of just a submissive partner in general.) Keep in mind, I am looking for before hand planning(""Porn Hunting"") for inspiration. Consists of the submissive listening to my desires and helping me to find pornographic images, similar to my wants/kinks, as well as theirs and also to inspire an RP moment. I have a passion for details both about myself and about others, so I love to know clothes details, bodily details, make up etc. Role Play may be anything and everything, so any other ideas you may have feel free to come to me with, along with pictures. However what I primarily seek and have a special place for is: Transformation Gender Play but other than that I am open minded to all types of sexual situations of course. If this is your cup of tea, read forward. \n\nI am seeking a scene that revolves around two male best friends; roommates. What happens is that one of us(or both of us) magically transforms from male to female. The twist is that the transformation is not triggered by some sort of magical potion, but it is triggered on our own guilty pleasure: Viewing porn pictures. It\'s a bit of a interactive twist that I want to try; incorporating porn pictures in the mix and actually looking at them together. Furthermore, the point of this ""porn hunting"" is that it will also help you see what I look for as well. The progression of how we ""bro out"" to porn is first by gawking at and literally picking the pictures apart and then slowly gradually noticing things in the porn that make us both realize in ""self discovery/epitome fashion"" together that ""hey, maybe being a chick is a sweet deal."" In other words, the appeal of power and money (free drinks, club life etc) is what ""tricks us""....That will be how we justify wanting to be a chick without sounding ""gay"" so to speak. It\'s a bit of a mix between orientation play, denial and simply a ""twisted bromance."" Also, one thing to take note is the manipulation flow. The ""vexed porn"" will poison your mind with this self-discovery first and then the way it will infect my mind is by you ""selling/manipulating"" the idea you just discovered and preach it to me as you porn hunt.\n\nAs I mentioned before, what I want us to have initially is a ""bromance/jock"" type of dynamic together. What that means is, I want more of a laid back conversation flow/style; I believe the slang term is ""chat speak."" I know it seems a bit rudimentary but oddly it is something that pleases me(I don\'t usually talk this way in real life.) I want there to be more of a laid back style of talking with one another; call each other ""bro, dude, man."" I want us to make jokes with each other, laugh, say lol. I want there to be also a hint of orientation banter/homoerotic jokes even borderline flirtation but in a denial sort of sense(if that makes ANY sense lol.) Don\'t be TOO much of an ass or be too mean. Remember we are best friends. Show some sense of warmth. Now, in terms of what I want you to pay attention for when we ""gawk at bitches"" so to speak is that I want you to verbally gawk at the women with me; pick apart the photo, describe the photo and what you enjoy in colorful ""eye candy"" detail. I don\'t mean just to say ""check those legs and heels on that babe"" but instead describe the heels, what color heels, what kind, and how her legs look, the skin tone etc. Also, keep in mind if I zone in on a specific part of the pic that is your cue to describe specifically that part with me. I want you to describe the pic as if it is not in front of us, pick apart and visualize the photo of what you enjoy(and even dislike) in true ""bro"" fashion. It\'s a way for you to not only learn my tastes but also to get into the style of inadvertently pleasing your ""bud"" with our ""circle jerk"" sort of porn session. Think of it also as an interactive approach to training you to learn my tastes and wants as potentially my switch/submissive.\n\nIn terms of ""kinks"" and ""fetishes"" I would have to say it\'s ever evolving and quite an open book.

Has anyone here gone on HRT? I'm mostly masculine identified (AFAB) but I have the occasional neutral or even more feminine day. For me, it's very much about physical dysphoria.
