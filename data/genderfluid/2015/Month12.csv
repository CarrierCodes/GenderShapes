About the not transitioning -- this is because I've lived as a cis woman, and very few people know me as genderfluid - I am married to a straight man, and I have two young kids. If I transitioned, I would lose my husband. Not because he wouldn't support me, but he can't help his sexual idenity either.. and if I have a male body, it would not work for him.

My 12 yr old came out to my wife and I last Christmas as being bisexual, saying she had known this for several years (she was 11 at the time)....she has since said that she identifies as genderfluid, male more often, and has asked to be called by a male name at home and by closest family and friends. She has recently started seeing a mental health therapist for issues of anxiety and anger management ( more anxiety than anger, her anger really just manifests with her little sister.) The therapist is also aware of her genderfluid identification, has worked with other young ppl in the same situation, and has given her some help in obtaining a free binder, and advised about the possibility of drugs to stop puberty. My daughter doesn't want to do any kind of drugs at this young age, so that is not proceeding.
A part of me wonders...is she too young for this? She has said its not a phase, but I have since found out her best friend also identifies as genderfluid, and I'm not sure who was first to admit it to the other. I wonder if it's simply a confusion in coming into her sexuality at this point, and something she will grow out of.
Please understand...I love my daughter more than anything, and nothing will change that....she can be lesbian, bisexual, or transition to become my son...nothing will change my love, and all I want is for her to be happy, safe, protected, and healthy.

The evidence mounts with every passing day and every bit of experimentation with girl mode and boy mode, but I don't wanna come to any conclusions yet.

I am DMAB but I have very androgenous features and body-type, and I already have long hair. I think I can pass in both girl mode and boy mode, with enough time and practice. I am trying to discover and face any internalised transphobia I can find, and so far, I've found little.

Overall, things seem stable on all fronts, right? Nothing too bad. But one thing that is distressing me deeply is this - Where do I fit in? 

I absolutely hate the idea of being called a cross-dresser. This is separate from my fears about passing as female - just the concept/prospect of being told I am a cross-dresser feels wrong to me, because it suggests that I am just a man wearing women's clothes. But, no, in girl mode, I am wearing women's clothes because I am a woman. Right? But them, am I also a man, when I am in boy mode?

I am bisexual, and I have never really worried about this sort of dichotomy there. If I am with a guy, I am in a ""gay relationship"", if I am with a girl, I am in a ""straight relationship."" But in both cases, I am still bi.

But here, if I am in girl mode, am I a woman? Or am I just genderfluid, no matter whether I am presenting as a man or a woman? Am I ever actually a woman, or ever actually a man? Do I belong in women's spaces? In men's spaces? Do I belong anywhere? And at the heart of it, I think my question really is this - how authentic is it for me to say I am a man? A woman? Both? Neither?

I don't know. I don't know! Please tell me what you think.

Ps. Does it even matter what the technicality is? In a same sex relationship, I am *functionally gay* even though I am bi. By the same logic, is it not enough that I am *functionally a woman* in girl mode? But, even if I can accept that, will other women accept that?

2015-12-29 06:36:50,3ymlig,4,3,"I had to wait to write this until I had a dysphoric moment; it's hard to describe to myself when I feel female, but I guess that's part of the confusion. I am a fifteen year old female. I am very aware of the difference between sex, gender, presentation, and sexuality (though the subcategories of some seem muddled), and I believe I might have fluctuating sexual dysphoria.

I'd never had a problem with the label of ""girl"" as a child because it didn't actually separate me from boys too much. Even learning about female sexual characteristics didn't make me think ""this isn't me"". (I wanted to hurry to late teens and didn't care what came with it beyond more privileges, I guess.) Once the first bits of puberty rolled in I started to have actual crushes on some people, only later realizing that while I was seeing the boys as potential partners, there were certain girls with which I would have loved to have been together, had that been an option. Okay, some challenges to sexuality, but gender seemed stable, or at least not an issue like many fully trans people had at that age.

Possibly before, but clearly around fourteen, I seemed to split. It was almost spiritual in nature; it wasn't like suddenly I had a masculine side revealed, it was as if both the masculine and feminine parts of me had crystallized into something more than just moods and interests. I had two different attitudes and outlooks on life, and I could swear when I looked in the mirror they each had a different face. I was already female-presenting at this point so the most I could do on the days where to seemed to switch into a masculine self was incorporate some androgynous elements to feel a bit less like I was in drag. I'd wonder sometimes why I even have female genitalia, and certainly the male equipment would be better there? and around this time I thought that it couldn't just be some woo I had created.

I started to take birth control this year due to pretty debilitating cramps and irregular cycles, which seemed to indicate my hormones were off (along with the feeling like a man more than the average female, but I wasn't going to say something like that when I had watched as my mom fill in ""heterosexual"" on the gyne patient sheet). Now that I have the estrogen dosages figured out somewhat, usually I'm comfortable in my body. But even if I've not missed a morning in weeks, I'll occasionally have flares of ""male-ness"", to the point of feeling more like a gay man than a woman when I'm with my boyfriend.

I am currently still female-presenting and haven't really told anyone how I feel. It'd be way too much of a hassle to switch to masculine-presenting, but while it'd leave out my feminine aspects and I wouldn't want to be sterile, I don't think I would have any more dysphoria than I do now if a total sex changes was more than hypothetical (that is to say, a fortunately low amount). More often it seems like the two sides are present together, for whatever reason, yet I still feel polarized at times. I haven't talked to my therapist because I don't know if he even handles such situations and so far the meetings have been with my mother present, so I don't have a professional opinion.

**Basically:** Does this seem abnormal in terms of typical development? Should I just continue to seem like a totally cis female and hope the hormones and feelings sort themselves out in the end, or would it be better to appear more androgynous and masculine as well to appeal to every bit of me at all times?",genderfluid,Questioning My Experiences,1451396210.0,"{'created_utc': 1451371010, 'id': '3ymlig', 'num_comments': 4, 'score': 3, 'selftext': 'I had to wait to write this until I had a dysphoric moment; it\'s hard to describe to myself when I feel female, but I guess that\'s part of the confusion.
