I am a 23 year old person (born a male) who has slowly ever since 9th grad tried coming to terms with my gender identity, and for the last 3 years have identified as genderfluid. And a such outwardly present and identify as a male or female depending on the day/mental state. 


On to the point. 

Lately my levels of dysphoria have been happening more and lasting longer, but only one way, even I'm forced to present male due to family/job but my brain is in full ""girl mode"". 

My main point is that lately I have been considering seeing a therapist related to gender identity issues, and possibly going on hrt to help develop a more feminine body, to  help with dysphoric days. I don't have genital dysphoric issues at all, if I were to ever decide full transition, I would keep what I have. Even presenting as and identifying as male when I enjoy and am comfortable with that, I still prefer a more lithe and androgenised appearance, so I think the changes physically from hrt would be welcome even to the male parts of myself. 


I guess what I really am saying is that I don't know if I need to take further steps or not. But just the act of writing this out has brought many emotions to the surface. 

Feedback welcome, will be crossposting on r\Trans

I'll try to summarize as best as I can!

My child was born female. Always a very very girly child, loved dresses, makeup, fashion. Was even a very girly cheerleader last year. Always an A+ student and in tons of sports. early spring of 2015 all her grades dropped and she quit every sport. In May 2015 (OMG has it only been 4 months??) my 12yr old daughter needed a haircut. Her face is very nicely framed with a pixie cut so I pushed for a pixie cut, she really didn't want it because she said she liked her long pretty hair. Well she finally agreed the cut was nice and got it. About a week later she sits me down and tells me shes pansexual and is gender fluid. She said she learned that word from a website and the only research she had done was reading one paragraph online about it but it sounded correct so she self diagnosed. 

So immediately got her a therapist. She met with the therapist privately a couple times then we met together. I was totally shocked to find out the therapist was coaching her on how to transition to a boy full time. Got to the bottom of it all, turns out my daughter had presented it as shes been transgender her whole life and wants to be a boy and got her haircut as a boy as her first transition step. News to me and a total and utter shock and didn't match the story she told me. 

She told me she still identified as gender fluid and wanted to be called Spencer, as it's a gender neutral name. wanting to support her an show love and acceptance I agreed. 

So school starts in August and she tells all her teachers she is now a boy and goes by Spencer. So all the teachers have a meeting and call in me to join them. They are all super supportive (which is amazing) but I jusst feel things are moving way too fast, and still don't make since. Her story changes and I feel like different people are getting different stories. The teachers are asking me how I want to proceed and I just don't know. I want the brakes put on! I want to give this time and figure out what's going on with my child. Where do I turn? who do I ask for help?

One of the biggest things I keep coming back to is how I'm not comfortable with who I am, physically. I often find myself thinking ""holy shit, I'm a real person, this is what I look like, I had no idea!"" and am constantly surprised that I never look how I feel and it often is very both distressing and disorientating. To give you a bit of an idea, I've got the build of Jared Leto meets Christian Bale, but often feel more along the lines of a Ruby Rose. I find myself feeling less and less masculine everyday and more androgynous or feminine, often fluctuating between the two; although rarely I still do feel masculine and am at least comfortable in my body when I feel that way.

I've heavily thought about transitioning as I just feel I would be so much happier and more comfortable with both who I am physically and as a person, but at the same time I'm absolutely terrified of both commitment and somehow just fucking it up. I know for those days I do feel Masculine, if I were to transition MtF, it would be so much easier to look more on the masculine side of androgyny (if that makes sense?) and would still feel rather satisfied with myself. 

I know this is a rather silly question to ask since it's about personal feelings, but, would that be a decent thing to do? Or is there an easier way to simply get by?

2015-09-18 02:19:47,3ldrij,0,6,"...and I'm a dmab person who has been on HRT for nearly two years.

I just had a moment when checking the mail and realizing that I actually purchased both of these things intentionally.

For a long time I've identified as genderless, and HRT really helped balance out my psychology. For two years I've been on a trajectory towards a female presentation, just to avoid the dysphoria that comes with being seen as my birth gender. For a couple of months I have been consistently 'passing' (a word I despise) that way, which has left me with a weird feeling.

2015-09-21 17:25:00,3ltu6o,3,4,"So I'm going to try and keep this short (ETA, NOT SHORT), but I've been questioning my gender identity for a few months now. I'm AFAB, 19 and Bisexual. I volunteer at a LGBTQA+ community and have been exposed to so many different kinds of people and it's helped me learn a lot about myself, but I have yet to bring this up with my GF/GQ friends for fear of offending them. Being in this community also makes me worry I'm just jumping on a bandwagon and trying to be ""trendy"". Help.

I dress fairly androgynously, though with 32C's, shoulder length hair and other feminine features, most people just call me a tomboy and I leave it at that. It's not that I don't like womens clothes, I've never tried to bind (I like my girls), it's just that I feel more comfortable wearing neutral clothing. I only wear dresses to formal events, any other day it's jeans/shorts/sometimes skirts and a t-shirt. I despise low cut tops, but mens shirts are hard for me to fit into without altering (have to buy large and tailor small for chest and shoulder reasons) so I mainly just buy neutral girls clothes. I bought my first pair of guys jeans the other week and am waiting for it to be cool enough outside to wear them, but I wear them in private and they make me happy. I also have a few pairs of boxers that I wear when lounging around the house (the loose fit is comfortable, but I prefer girls panties when actually getting ready for the day because boxers get scrunched up in fitted jeans) and I love them. I've thought of cutting my hair short to better fit my personality, but I'm also really attached to the curls and refuse to chop more off than I have to. In short, I'm fairly noticeably female and have no desire to change my body to conform to an androgynous lifestyle, but because of this, everything I wear looks feminine, or at best tomboy. This discrepancy is one of the #1 reasons I question my identity. Am I just a female who likes dressing a certain way, or am I genderfluid who doesn't want to change their body to conform with a stereotype? 

Now to my childhood bit. I'll say it now, me being a girl was a big problem. My father was out of my life by 7, and dead by 9. I was a daddys girl, but that stopped at a really young age. My mother grew up in an abusive household where her brother was more valued for being a boy and she was disposable because she was a girl. She carried this attitude on, along with the abuse, to my childhood. My brother was adored, my sister took an incredible amount of verbal abuse. Dad did nothing to stop it. When they moved out when I was 5, I was the next plaything. My little girl cuteness only saved me from so much, and I was only allowed to be female while my dad was still around. When my mother and I lived alone, any behavior that my mother didn't like was strongly rebuked verbally and physically. I learned to behave as she wanted me to, which included a lot of stereotypical male behavior. I didn't voluntarily wear a dress from 7 to 18 ( I say voluntarily because she would literally make me wear dresses in public as punishment and at 15 she bought handfuls of dresses that I feigned interest in because I knew anything else would get me beat) I now own four dresses that I really like, but it still takes a lot for me to wear them. I'm warming up to skirts, but they have to be knee length and loose. 

But anyway, childhood. I had two step-nephews close to my age. One was 6 years older, one a year younger and I grew up with them as if they were brothers. The oldest was very macho, the youngest was more feminine. The eldest protected me, I protected the youngest. I would wear their clothes, rough-house with them and played sports with them. I remember one easter wearing a guys button-up and corduroy pants. I grew thinking I was one of the guys and this was in turn re-enforced through my mother. Basically, I was a substitute-guy for the majority of my childhood. That changed at puberty. Then, my mother tried to make me female and I really had no choice in the matter. I wore more feminine clothes in public and was made to wear makeup and ill-fitting bras. I was also repeatedly told being a girl was still a very bad thing and that I would be raped by every man I met. I'm still working through this. I learned to fear and despise being a woman in an entirely new and different way. I was taken out of school at ten so I never got to explore my sexuality except through romance books and porn which were all very hetero-normative. It wasn't until seeing a bisexual character in a tv show at 15 that I was finally able to pinpoint why I liked both genders and that it was ok. Of course, telling my mother brought on more abuse and I never got to actually date outside of the man I would currently be engaged to if it werent for our long-distance situation. Basically, I was locked up and abused for my entire life until I ran away at 18 and found my community where I actually was able to learn about myself and find out that it was ok being different. I am still working through the misogyny I grew up with, but I know what was done was wrong and that being female is ok. And yet, I still am more comfortable being masculine and largely reject feminine things...except for that part of that actually *really* likes being feminine and fuck it's confusing.

Like, I sometimes like to dress up, but it takes a lot of courage. I know part of this is the dysphoria I was forced to grow up with, but I am also trying to accept where I am now and that is that I *actually like being able to be either male or female depending on my mood*. My boyfriend says dating me is basically dating a guy in a womans body and he loves my male and female sides equally. He encourages it actually and was the one to coax me to buying a pair of guys jeans. He's a very strange man, but in a good way. Very supportive. 

This went way longer than I thought it would, but it's helped. I feel less scared and more certain, but I still have my reservations. I guess I'm still trying to figure out if this just makes me a female with non-stereotypical behavior, a special snowflake, or an honest Genderfluid with issues.

So, I decided to tell my boyfriend. And he's okay with it!! I'm so incredibly happy right now. When I told him, he didn't quite understand it. So, when I explained it to him he sat next to me and looked me in the eyes. He said ""you still love me right?"" I, of course, said yes, and he said ""then I don't care."" I cried. This is possibly one of the happiest moments of my life. I feel so free. Ruby Rose was right, it's so damn freeing.

I was so scared to tell him, I was afraid of his reaction because he's the type of person who doesn't really believe in this kind of stuff. But, the thing is, he doesn't believe because he doesn't understand, so I helped him understand and he was so kind to me.

And he\'s okay with it!! I\'m so incredibly happy right now. When I told him, he didn\'t quite understand it. So, when I explained it to him he sat next to me and looked me in the eyes. He said ""you still love me right?"" I, of course, said yes, and he said ""then I don\'t care."" I cried. This is possibly one of the happiest moments of my life. I feel so free. Ruby Rose was right, it\'s so damn freeing.\n\nI was so scared to tell him, I was afraid of his reaction because he\'s the type of person who doesn\'t really believe in this kind of stuff. But, the thing is, he doesn\'t believe because he doesn\'t understand, so I helped him understand and he was so kind to me.

2015-09-28 18:47:25,3mqe63,2,5,"Hi everyone,

About a year or so ago, I posted a request here for people to consider participating in a research study. I was interested in how experiences of being discriminated against, internalized transphobia, and worries about potential discrimination might impact mental health (for example, depression and thoughts of suicide). I also wanted to know how support from family and friends might help to protect against depression. A number of you requested that when I completed the project I post back on here what I found. So I’m writing with an update on that study and wanted to share the findings here. 

In short, what we found (perhaps unsurprisingly to many of you) is that experiences of being discriminated against, feelings related to internalized transphobia, and worries/concerns about the potential for discrimination were all related to higher levels of depression. Depression in turn was strongly related to greater suicidality. An interesting finding, I think, is that internalized transphobia was also directly related to suicidality, even after accounting for depression. In other words, while experiences of discrimination and worries about discrimination only related to depression and not suicide when examined at the same time, internalized transphobia related to both. This is important because it demonstrates just how much of an impact negative feelings about one’s own gender identity can have. Another interesting finding was that support from friends was associated with lower levels of depression, but support from family was not related to anything. However, I think that particular finding may have been related to how we measured family support, so I’m not sure that we can draw many conclusions from that right now. 

For those of you who took the survey, you may also remember answering questions about drug use and alcohol use: for the most part, drug and alcohol use were not particularly relevant to either your experiences or to mental health. And finally, we compared the results across different trans subgroups. It’s hard to draw definitive conclusions without larger numbers of participants, but based on what we did have, it doesn’t seem as though these findings were different between groups.

If anyone has any questions at all about any of this or has any comments, please feel free to post here or get in touch with me directly at etebbe2@unl.edu.
