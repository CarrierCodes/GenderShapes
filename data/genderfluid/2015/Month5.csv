2015-05-02 18:38:21,34n9g9,0,1,"Been lurking a bit, commenting here and there, getting my courage up to tell my story. Here goes.

I am biologically male, in my early 40s. I have a string of failed marriages behind me with a few kids scattered amongst them. Ive always battled depression, body image issues, etc. For me, femininity expressions were a fetish, and one I kept pretty private. On the occasions I brought it up to a SO/wife, there was usually a cursory “OK, we can explore that if you want, I guess” but never any follow through. In hindsight, not being able to be myself probably contributed to my distance or questionable decisions that led to those relationships imploding. I briefly questioned what my sexuality was and decided I was not attracted to men, even though some of what I felt throughout my adult life made me feel I ought to be. (I have realized I am strongly attracted to feminine features/body types but genitals are irrelevant to me).

But that changed when things got serious with my new partner. She identifies as genderfluid, biologically female. She embraced my “fetish” immediately, and she knew there was more to it. She helped me realize that I am not just one gender. I guess genderfluid is one label that applies to me (so many labels we have to choose from! I can’t keep track of them all!) but I also think of myself as trans, because I know I want to go through some sort of transition to get where I want to be, to where I feel I am inside. Sometimes I feel more masculine and sometimes more feminine. For now, we think of and talk of my “feminine side” as a distinct personality, but it’s mostly to make sense of the different ways I feel at times and having a name/label for both aspects of me is convenient.

We have bought me clothes and I dress when we can have privacy together (toddlers make that hard, and I’m still coming to terms with who I am myself, not ready to broach it with others, plus I have NO IDEA how the exes will take it and am not ready for that possible fight). I’m getting ready to come out to a few different friends who I know will be supportive but other than this this is my first real “coming out”.

Transition will be complicated for me if possible at all due to a serious health condition that may be terminal. We’ll see. For now, I’m focusing on finding out who I am and ways to express that. I definitely have body dysphoria issues but am comfortable with my genitals. I want to thank everyone here who has shared their stories because seeing people who share my issues has already helped me immensely. I share my own story to maybe offer the same to someone else and to ask for support/insight from anyone willing to offer. Y’all are great. Thanks.

cismale here!  I like this community and the ideas and expressions it represents.  I hope I am not being insensitive in any way, I just wanted to get some thoughts on my idea and facilitate discussion. I apologize in advance if I step on some toes!

Pronouns are an issue aren't they?  Especially for you folks.  Hell, even for me.  I don't FEEL like a MAN.  I barely look like one.

I have no idea this is a huge stab in the dark for me, but I was talking with my good friend about this whole situation and how she has to be PC at work for her customers.  Good on her asking pronouns is the right thing to do!  It should be as easy as asking a name,  I mean how often we use them they might as well be our names.

HE SHE IT WE YOU THEY?

That is some seriously limited bullshit.  IDK MY BFF JILL about this shit, but it is a little annoying that we haven't updated that.  I'm not calling for a revolution, and I'm not saying my idea is a good one.  I just like to talk about language and have fun.  What if life was like the internet, and you went by a handle.

2015-05-05 07:10:16,34x1b3,0,1,"I'm a 17 year and 7 month old, physically male, genderfluid person. I have nobody to go to about any of my worries about all of this (that can give me advice at least) and I was thinking maybe all of you could help.

To begin, I guess, I was kicked out of where my mother lived 8 months ago because I was a problem for her due to all of my mental health issues. I was lucky enough to have my dad take me in because he felt bad about almost never being in my life until I was about 14 and he wanted to get to know me. He seemed friendly enough and I went with it. I started working and obtained my GED.

To get into the gender stuff, I've always felt that I should have been a female but liked my male form. I was always into girly stuff a lot more than boyish stuff and later on in my short life would regularly try on my older sister's clothes and makeup in secret because I felt like if I was caught by anyone I would get in trouble because I was already bullied constantly by my peers and family for being girly. I ended up hiding away a lot of my girlier tendencies until I was about 14 and I met my best friend who was completely okay with everything I was and I got to be all of me with her.

I've recently tried to come out about my bisexuality with my mom (I'm still in contact with her and see her regularly because even though she's kicked me out she still wants to have a relationship and I need her for insurance reasons) and dad. My dad took it surprisingly well. He literally said ""okay"" and we both just carried on like nothing. My mom on the other hand tried to convince me I'm delusional and that it's a phase even though I've felt really attracted to both males and females since I was about 9 or 10 years old and had silly little flings with both males and females in 8th grade and my freshman year of high school (in secret of course).

The reason my bisexuality is relevant to all of this is because I feel so very trapped in having to act completely masculine almost 24/7. I just want to be able to go completely crazy with all of my feminine things but I simply can't do that because I can't really risk my mom just completely disowning me (I'm assuming her reaction would be worse than my coming out) and even though my dad's reaction to my coming out was perfect he's shown a lot of hate for transgenders because of the whole Bruce Jenner interview and I can't risk him disowning me because then I wouldn't have anywhere to live (I've only been working about a month and a half and have nowhere near enough income to find a place of my own where I live). He's even shown a lot of hate towards me doing little girly things like painting my toenails and elaborately styling my long hair when I'm just at home. I did those things because I felt okay enough with him to show a little bit of that since he took my coming out well but I quickly stopped once he told me to stop acting like a girl.

It's honestly killing me. I've tied quite a few nooses and held a lot of knives to my throat but I've somehow not done anything.

Yesterday morning something in my brain snapped. I had to get it out. He was at work and so I sent a long rambely email. Explaining what I could and giving resources to better explain other things. I sat nervously for the rest of the day. Refreshing my email. Hoping for a reply. Knowing in the back of my mind that it was going to be okay, but still being so scared. What if it wasn't? My SO is a white cis-male, and though an accepting person was raised in rural-white-bead-christian-conservative land and didn't know a whole lot about the lgbt+ community until my ass somehow landed itself half way across the country from my home town to this strange rural land. He was just beginning to wrap his head around the trans* community, was it going to push him too far to bring it into our own home? I tried to tell myself that he always appreciated my masculine side anyway ""like my best guyfriend, but with boobs!"" and for a straight guy he is very open in the bedroom as well. ""Doesn't matter who you are or what you believe, the fact is if you stimulate a man's prostate right he's gonna like it..."" So pegging had already been long introduced into our play. But the doubt was there nonetheless. 

When he finally got home, the first thing he did was hug me and apologize for not replying to my email, because by the time he read through it all he actually had to work. And he reminded me, like he often does, that no matter what he still loves me. 

He held me while I sobbed, and like he's so good at, started annoying the hell out of me to try and cheer me up. Poking at me until I was forced to smile. Asking silly questions like ""so can I call you bro now?"" and ""I can still shout 'woman!' at you right? because whether you're a guy or girl you're still a total house wife you know that right?...but really if you don't want me to of course I'll work on it."" ""Am I going to have to get you a red coat?"" (I'm a big Outlander fan, and SO is a Scott, who wears his kilt on the regular. There's a red coat officer in the series who's obsessively in lust with the main character, who many people describe my SO to look exactly like.) 

After much teasing and prodding and poking, he kissed me deeply and held me closely, before asking if after we made dinner if I wanted to go on a nice long hike back to his family's private camp site to have some privacy to let my primal masculine instinct out in the woods. ""You've got good timing coming out, I've been craving you inside me anyway."" We packed a bag with blankets and toys, and headed into the woods so I could peg him with nothing but the sounds of us and the stream and the wind through the trees. 

We laid there for some time after, naked in the middle of the woods until we got to chilly to stay still and got up and hiked out way back out. We took the long, scenic drive back. Stopping to admire the scenery here and there. We swung by the general store in town and he bought some snacks for me, took me home and I read and ate while he showed my different games he'd like us to play together. Shortly after we crawled into bed for the night, taking each other once more before we fell asleep.

2015-05-30 01:26:00,37skvv,9,6,"So hi everyone, I'm a newbie here. Basic info, I guess? Mid-20s AFAB genderfluid human who uses mostly she pronouns but is contemplating they pronouns. My gender usually slides between female and neutral, but I've had a couple days' worth of very strong boy feelings recently, so that's... that's new. Anywhos! Nice to meet you and such! On to my topics of discussion. **This is gonna get kinda long, my apologies.**

First off, I am short and fat. I have curves, squish, stretch marks, and a, shall we say, considerable bust. And housing that bust is a problem. Can't find bras that fit right in stores, and the size that's closest to fitting only comes in one style and like two colors where I shop. Last time I measured, the total all the way around the fullest part of my bust was somewhere in the 50-inches range.

That makes me really, REALLY worry about shopping for binders. I'm absolutely clueless about binder shopping, and I worry about the cost of a binder versus the risk that comes with not being able to try it before I buy it. I'm not sure there's any way to get me flat, really. But that's not the only problem.

I have some sensory issues with my breasts. When I become aware of my breasts touching each other, or touching the parts of my chest that get covered by underboob, it feels physically wrong, viscerally disgusting, and gives me severe nope. I have been scared away from the idea of binding for almost a year now because I've been so afraid that rather than helping me feel better about myself, binding would only make it worse by smashing those monsters even more into my chest, causing even more contact-nope than before. And if that happened, I know I would be collassally screwed, and I don't know if I could handle that.

So, I guess I have some questions, and they would be thus:

* How does a person with my kind of a bust go about finding the right binder? How does flattening a 50+ inch chest work?
* What should I be prepared for in terms of how binding feels? (Bustier folks' answers very much appreciated!!)
* Are there other people out there with sensory issues who bind, and if so, how do y'all cope with that?
