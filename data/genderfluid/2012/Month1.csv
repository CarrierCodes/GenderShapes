I'm a 23 year old and biologically male. I recently learned about non-binary gender and genderqueer and started to think if it would be an accurate label for me.

I've never conformed to my expected gender completely. I played with both toys meant for boys with my male friends in childhood as well as with girl toys with my sister. I was never really embarrassed about it at a younger age. But bullying that started when I entered high school made me very afraid to be non-conforming.

Just playing with girls toys at a young age probably doesn't qualify me as genderqueer, but there is more. I've always been *very* curious about what it would be like if I was a (biological) woman. I feel my mind could easily adapt to being either a woman or a man. And though I'm usually quite happy with my male sex, I sometimes feel extremely disappointed that I am not a woman and sometimes dream or fantasize about being one (Sometimes I want to touch my own body and feel female parts, and am disappointed to feel a very male body). Occasionally, but not always this fantasizing is also sexual. It doesn't matter if I am a man or woman in my fantasies though, I'm always heterosexual. 

I don't really know what more to tell you. I'll add that I am quite uncomfortable about sex and sexuality, mainly due to aforementioned bullying and low self-esteem about my body/looks. I am not really familiar with the terminology in the queer community either. I'm not quite sure what I'm expecting from this post. I guess some support or even answers. I'm desperately looking to put a label on the feelings I'm having, am I genderqueer?

Actually, I'm just writing to let you, and people in every single related subreddit I can find (from the larger r/lgbt to the asexual community), about a new project on its way.

To keep it brief, we have the idea of forming a small Big Siblings program on this site. It would be intended to serve the mentoring needs of all people with non-normative sexualities or gender identities/presentations.

We're still coordinating, but there are a few things worth noting here that are already solid.

None of the moderators of this space will have any affiliation with any moderators of any other space, no crossover or overlap. The polarizing events across multiple boards make crossover inappropriate, especially given the sensitive challenge and special needs of those who would be seeking mentors in the forum.

It won't be a discussion forum. People will be gently encouraged into all the various subreddits available to them, with neither judgment nor preference on our part, to have public discussions as they wish. Our place will be only for collecting posts from those volunteering as mentors and those looking to be mentored.

Finally, mentors will be held to high standards of conduct and verification (though in no way are required to share any identifying information), and as such will never be drawn from those who have made their names by way of polarizing activities, on either side of any particular controversy.

We thought you all here might appreciate being aware of this coming service and space, and welcome questions. Further, if the moderators here deem this post inappropriate, deleting it won't result in any private message fussing or other harassment.

Thanks for your time &lt;3

K and I are both 23, have been a couple for about a year and a half, and have been living together since July. I am a queer femme woman. K prefers female pronouns and to most of the world presents as a masculine gay woman, but her identity is a bit more complicated than that. She strongly considered transitioning to male when she started college but eventually decided she is not a man. She's admitted to me that she also does not identify as a woman. Tentatively, she's used the term genderqueer, even though she hates how political that word sounds. My best way to describe her would probably be ""effeminate transmasculine queer person"" (not exactly a catchy title, but at least a combination of the ways she's described herself). Regardless of the way you put it, though, her gender ambiguity has caused her a lot of pain and angst that she's still struggling with.

We joke about K being stone butch. It's not totally accurate, since I'll touch her and go down on her and all, but there's a grain of truth. She's generally the fucker and I'm the fuckee. I have... mixed emotions about this situation. I do lean towards being a bottom, but I want to give her pleasure as well. When I'm focusing on her, she says something stops her from feeling it and it suddenly seems like she's floating above herself. Sometimes she thinks she might have orgasmed, but she can't say for sure since she feels so disconnected from her body. It's difficult for her to give me feedback about what feels good because of this. I've asked her to show or tell me what she does when she masturbates, but she told me she has this trouble even more when she's riding solo.

The other night, I asked K if this had anything to do with her gender trouble and she agreed that yes, it does. During this conversation she revealed that she wants to get top surgery. I've known for a while that her chest causes her some dysphoria so I ask how she wants it to be touched, if at all, but she always replies that she really doesn't know what she wants.

I guess I'm just at a loss. I don't want to pressure her, but in conversations outside the heat of the moment K's requested that I try to push her gently, bit by bit. But when we're in bed together, I'll go down on her for 20 minutes and she just begs to fuck me instead. It's not like she hasn't tried masturbating, or vibrators, or the usual bag of tricks. And while I want her to feel good and comfortable and horny in the body she has now, I also know that her dysphoria is very real and can't be fixed by run of the mill body acceptance spiels.

I guess I'm just asking for any suggestions you might have. I love K so much and just want to help her carve out a niche she feels alive in. Have you overcome similar problems? How would you like your cisgendered partners to approach a topic like this? What questions do you wish they'd ask?

I'm a 19 years old FT?. Currently six months on Testosterone. I'm taking Primoteston Depot .8ml/fortnight with the facility to vary that dosage anywhere from .1ml/fortnight to 1ml/fortnight at my discretion. I've been dropped from 1ml because my T levels where too high (like double the normal maximum male range). I haven't had any significant negative side effects except pimples which I solved by taking doxycyclon.

I don't want to drop so low that my periods start again (ewwww), or that I lose the muscle gaining ability (awesome). But I also haven't gained much hair so far (and don't want to). I've got some snail trail happening (which I like a lot) and a light moustache (I think it's cute) but otherwise don't have any other facial hair. I think I don't want any (not really sure).

My GP treats me like the rest of her trans men clients and doesn't really understand my gender identity, but that's okay. If I tell her I want something she's totally respectful of that.

I know I want top surgery, but not yet. I've lost 12kg since starting T and want to lose about another 10 (which would put me at about 65 kg, 175 cm). Plus I want to gain a bunch more muscle before looking at my top surgery options in (6 months to 2 years?) I've heard the ones in Australia aren't good for larger breasts and mine are about D cups now.

Suggestions? Anecdotes? I'm the only partially transitioning person I know, despite knowing truckloads of trans men and women.

This is just an alt account that I'm posting from because I'm still a bit embarrassed about this.  I'm a 27 year old biologically male homosexual.  I'm generally happy being a man.  I guess by that I mean I wouldn't trade my penis for anything.

But at the same time, since I was young (12-13), I have always felt that some part of me was a bit ""girly"".  I always felt comfortable around girls and talking about girly stuff.  There was never, and is still never any sexual attraction to ladies.  Also, as far a sexual matters go, I'm exclusively passive when it comes to sex.  I'd generally say I like the more feminine roles I guess.  

When I hit puberty, things started to get way weirder.  On top of being sexually attracted to men, some...strange things started to happen to my body.  First of all, I grew breasts.  They ended up being large As/small Bs.  After getting checked by a doctor, mainly because of being embarrassed and confused about being a guy with boobs, they were definitely breast tissue and not a product of being overweight (which I never was).  Another thing is that I never really grew any body hair.  I have some very sparce hair on my arms and legs, but that's it aside from pubic hair.  Suffice to say, this has been a source embarassment and confusion at times.

All of this has recently come to a head for me since I've come out as gay a year and a half ago.  Since I've come to terms with my sexual orientation, now I've become concerned with my gender identity.  Very recently I've begun to embrace my femininity for the first time.  I've been buying some women's shirts/pants and so on.  I also got an androgynous haircut.  I'm still a bit afraid of wearing the clothes out in public, but I have been at home.

I dunno, I feel like I've been making progress, but I'm still *very* confused.  It's just that it always feels like some part of me is hiding at any given point.  Generally this isn't a big huge concern, but it really bothers me when I think about getting into a relationship that whoever I'm with will feel decieved if they meet me as more masculine and discover that I have a really huge feminine side.  Or if they meet me when I'm more feminine, they won't be interested in me because I'm not masculine enough.  I'd really like to know how other people deal with problems like this.  

I'm sorry for rambling, but this is the first time that I've ever really come out and said any of this stuff to anyone.  But it feels good to.

**tl;dr I'm a gay guy with the secondary sex characteristics of a woman and I'm finally cool with it myself but I'm afraid of how it may effect future relationships**

I\'m a 27 year old biologically male homosexual.  I\'m generally happy being a man.  I guess by that I mean I wouldn\'t trade my penis for anything.\n\nBut at the same time, since I was young (12-13), I have always felt that some part of me was a bit ""girly"".  I always felt comfortable around girls and talking about girly stuff.  There was never, and is still never any sexual attraction to ladies.  Also, as far a sexual matters go, I\'m exclusively passive when it comes to sex.
