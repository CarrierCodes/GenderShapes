I'm a gender-weird, disidentifyin', binary-smashin', femme-fag-leanin' queer who's usually read as an androgynous gay girl. I have a ""girl name"" that I haven't really thought about changing, and that can't be nicknamed into something less gendered. I've used she/her pronouns my whole life, and never really felt uncomfortable with them until now.

Basically, this summer I have been spending more and more time (pretty much all the time when I'm not working) in spaces where I'm asked to volunteer my pronouns. Even though the people I'm with are super queer and mostly pretty great, I feel like when I say I use she and her, people assume I'm identifying as female. I realized that I don't really prefer she/her at all, I just use it because it's easier... if I could really really choose, I would want to go by they/them.

I feel like if I had an androgynous or ""boy name"", or if I were more masculine-presenting or visibly gender-variant, I might be more okay with she/her. But with the way I present and the body I have (neither of which I really want to change) I feel like every ""she"" is gendering me as female and I don't want that anymore. But I worry that choosing they/them would come across as disingenuous and privilege-denying, or even appropriative. Especially because I don't picture myself correcting people who refer to me as ""she"" (which I am certain will continue to happen)- I just want to tell people, when they ask, that my preference is they/them. And maybe I'll like it a lot and start wanting to use it exclusively in the future, but for now I only feel comfortable using it in queer spaces where people generally know what's up.

Anyway. For those of you who use some kind of non-binary pronoun: What led you to start using the pronouns you use? Do you use it in every context (family, work, straight friends?) And for any of you that don't use the same pronoun all the time, how has that worked out for you? Also, for non-binary people who use gendered pronouns, how has that worked out?

My wife and I (m) are both a bit alternative, both bi, kinky, Burners, etc.  Just stating that to give a brief background, however we are also both mature, stable, responsible adults, we own our own home, she has a professional well paying job, I am an artist and a stay at home parent.  So we recently had our first and only kid (getting a vasectomy so it's for sure), and we are going to provide the best life possible and be the best parents possible.

My wife knows about my CD and is very supportive, I was actually in CD when we met, and she helps me pick out my CD outfits and do my makeup, etc.   I don't do CD 24/7, I consider myself gender queer and not trans, thus I don't want to be a woman or even look like a woman all the time, I am a person that likes having fun with his look, usually more on the effeminate, gay boy look or of course full CD or sissy look.  If anything, the look I like to have is very girly, girly boy look.

We both want to raise our child to be free thinking, open minded and non prejudicial, conformist or biased towards anything and this includes gender, gender stereotypes and clothing.  So if he wants to wear all blue and only overalls and jeans that is fine but if he wants to wear pink tutus and fairy wings with a tiara that is fine too, I won't push him either way or put my CD issues or beliefs on him, I just want him to know that he can dress and look however he wants and his parents will defend and support him in his choices.  Just as he can play rugby or dance ballet, it is up to him.

Now, I don't want this to sound selfish, but I don't think I should change my lifestyle in who I am at my core and get rid of my love and desire to CD and wear costumes, accessorize, wear jewelry and have girly or gay boy fashion sense, just so I can appear to be a""normal"" parent and so he won't be teased that his dad is a fag or whatever.  I hope that I can bring him up as an artist/costumer/burner/sculptor/etc, who will appreciate deviation from the norm and defend his dad's eccentricity and life choices.  In short, like most all parents, I hope to instill in him with what I see as the right values and morals.

Anyhow, the question and issue I want to pose to others is that right now our son is an infant and too small to understand, but as he grows older, assuming I don't decide to give up CD when around him and keep it to just private outings and parties, then he is going to see dad dressed up.  Thus I would love to know how other parents handle or plan to handle this situation.  How do you or did you intend to explain it, how did your child react, etc.  

Btw, in closing, I think it should be noted, as to me it makes a difference in respect to this situation, that I don't usually do the full CD with a wig and make up.  I do enjoy those things, but keep them more for parties.  My view on clothing actually is that all clothing is gender neutral and anyone should be able to wear anything they want.  Thus, when hanging around the house, I might slip into a tshirt and sweat pants or a skirt with leggings and a tshirt or jeans and a blouse, or jeans and a tshirt with pink panties underneath or any combination of anything.  Personally this is what I want my child to become used to and cool with, not with me looking like another gender or completely other person but rather just enjoying a wide variety and style of clothes.

Sorry for the length, but I have been wanting to ask this for a long time.

It's been a few weeks since I started regularly going on Reddit, and once I did I almost immediately stumbled across this page. Ever since finding this near little place I have had and endless stream of questions flow through my mind. For better or worse I've always known who I am. I've always known that I was interested in boys, girls, and everything in between (though only recently did I discover the terminology for such), and while holding this knowledge hasn't always been easy, it has always been present.

This is the first time in my life that I don't really know who I am, and it's quite frightening for me. I've thought through writing this very many times, and this is where I always draw a blank. The only surefire way I've found to put myself out there is through creative writing, so I took tried that out.

As the title of it may imply... it's roughly 4:30 AM right now. I don't feel as if I belong to any one gender, nor do I feel as if third, nor do I really feel that much like a mix.

For the past year I've been dating a girl, I met through therapy - she suffers from BPD, I have severe PTSD it's a ""match made in hell"" according to my shrink.. - we've had ups and downs but we've made it this far.

Recently she came out as Neutrois, and really wants to be seen as having no gender at all. Something I can't really get my head around. Now while I'm still allowed to call her by her given name Anna, she makes most other people call her Stiv, after Stiv Bators (which she admits is really a placeholder while she finds a truly gender neutral name).

Now I have a very horrid thing about men - I was sexually, verbally and physically abused by my stepfather and I don't tolerate men around me very well. I'm equal parts terrified and pissed off around them. I have been terrified that it's possible she wants to change gender and is settling as neutrois because of my issues - which I don't want.

I've read a few things on Neutrois and I can't say I understand it too well but I'm really trying.

I'm a bisexual genderqueer female who has been in a committed relationship with a great guy for several years. I've always had a more traditionally male personality than most women, and over the last couple years, I've had progressively more issues with that. I like my makeup and my fancy shoes, but if I could snap my fingers and get a sex change, I'd do it in an instant.

I've been on birth control for a long time, and my doctor switched it last year, which killed my sex drive. I got it switched again to fix that issue, but I've found that my gender confusion has thrown a monkey wrench into things. About a year ago, I started masturbating while imagining I had a penis. It went from an occasional thing, to a constant thing, to a thing I did every single time. I can't remember the last time I didn't do that while masturbating. After the recent medicine switch, I'm finding I'm interested in sex again... but not as a female. I'm interested in having sex with women, possibly men, as a man.

I don't want surgery because I feel that it's too expensive and invasive for not enough physical return (absolutely not against it in general, but it's not for me). I'm okay with my female body, though periods and pregnancy absolutely disgust me. I'm stuck in it, for better or worse. I just don't know what to do about my physical gender not matching up with my sexual desires.

I've always had a more traditionally male personality than most women, and over the last couple years, I've had progressively more issues with that.

I got it switched again to fix that issue, but I've found that my gender confusion has thrown a monkey wrench into things. About a year ago, I started masturbating while imagining I had a penis. It went from an occasional thing, to a constant thing, to a thing I did every single time. I can't remember the last time I didn't do that while masturbating.

1. Do hormone supplements/testosterone blockers begin to make the body more female? Like, do breasts begin to grow and hips and curves and all that? I have no experience with such things and I'm very curious as to how effective they are.

2. Does a full transition include surgery for genitalia reversal?

3. How long would you have to be on hormone supplements until surgery can be performed?

33,2012-07-16 19:21:59,wnpzy,16,22,"Ok so I'm a 21 year old guy. I've always been on the shy/sensitive side and dealt with social anxiety for a large portion of my life. I'm not sure where it comes from, but I think part of it is a defense mechanism to hide that sensitive side of me.

So lately I've just been more accepting of the possible transgender feelings, not repressing anything. For a large portion of my life I've been more masculine because I saw femininity as weakness. Well probably mostly because other guys get a lot of crap for not being particularly manly. 

Now I'm just trying to come to terms if this is more of a gender thing or if it's just my imagination. See I believe that some men have repressed feminine traits and the only way they feel comfortable letting them out is to crossdress or identify with being more female, as opposed to integrating it into their own masculinity. So that may be what I'm doing.

So right now I feel like a girl, but a man? It's like I'm completely comfortable in my body, I just feel strange. My mentality feels like it shifted and my perspective is changed. More feminine I guess. Now in the past stuff like this scared me and I'd push it down, which just caused a lot of trouble. So I feel like a lot of it is just repressed feelings coming to the surface and right now it's overpowering. I have a feeling it's going to normalize or shift. Or maybe it won't and this is really my true self. 

But like I said this could have nothing to do with gender. It's possible I confused masculine for cold, distant, independent and feminine for happy, friendly, and socialble. So there was a split in my personality almost. A lot of these changes are more internal, with a slight desire to crossdress and see myself as female. 

Right now I feel like I get it, but I think I've had this happen to me before and I switch back to a more male mindset. I'll have to see what happens. I don't want to force anything, I'd rather just let it unfold naturally.

34,2012-07-17 06:03:00,wotag,5,20,"Hi. This is a throwaway. From the title, I'm sure you understand why I would want to remain anonymous. I started exploring some of my pansexual/transgender issues with my therapist today--started being the operative word. He suggested I should try to get more in touch with the trans* community, and I thought here might be a great place to start.

So I'm biologically male and have been wildly dissatisfied with it since I entered high school. There were signs of it all down the line; I've always been more interested in technology, mass media, and art (like any good 90s kid who grew up on the Internet) than typical ""male"" stuff. But thanks to my rigorously religious upbringing with my mom and (especially) stepdad, I was railroaded into being a good, straight, cis-gendered, God-fearing white Christian boy. Well, until I wasn't.

At 15, I would occasionally steal clothes from my stepsister. The one time I tried stealing her eye makeup, my mom came home early and damn near busted me in the act. Considering how close-minded my parents were (and me, by extension), I just decided to write it off as a shameful bit of curiosity and hope she never brought it up again. ""At least I'm still straight, right? God shouldn't hold this against me if I repent.""

Finding out I was at least bi came in a way I wasn't expecting. I was 17, lying in bed messing around with myself, and for some reason the thought of Zelda/Sheik, the gender-bending deuteragonist of Ocarina of Time, crossed my mind. Before long, I realized I was having my first gay sexual fantasy--and I liked it. Since I was still very much a True Believer (I'm talkin' bout young-earth creationist and denominational Christians are going to Hell for polluting the Gospel), I descended into a shame spiral that led me to believe, for about four years, that I could literally die at any moment by some tragedy or the Second Coming, whereupon I would be left screaming and on fire forever.

At 19, I quit going to church and tried to be more okay with being bisexual. That worked great until I dropped out of community college and had to move back in with my parents six months later. Suddenly, I was being dragged to church three times a week, which caused me a great deal of stress and emotional pain--to say nothing of how my faith began to erode as I witnessed the fear, loathing, and hypocrisy among the ranks there.

A little over a year later (20-21), I moved out on my own with my (hot, regrettably straight) best friend, got into my first serious (read: abusive) relationship with a girl (who manipulated me out of my virginity), and finally quit going to church for good. I actually worked up the courage to tell my evil ex that I was bisexual, wanted to try pegging--in other words, everything I was aware of at the time. She took it well, but she couldn't resist the occasional disparaging remark about ""One day you're gonna leave me for the personal trainer,"" which I resented.

After almost two years together (22-23), I managed to get out of that train wreck before I moved across the country with her (which was good) and got back into school. I told my best friend that I had a crush on him, and he said he was flattered but it wasn't happening. So there I was in a new town, with limited social skills and few friends, and I decided to throw myself at the craigslist meat grinder--which had the unintended consequences of making me feel like a cheap, worthless whore. Those awful two-night stands made me realize I really was kind of a girl when it came to sex--for better (fantastic lover) and for worse (getting attached).

24 was a rollercoaster. I dated a straight girl who wanted me to be more masculine, with whom I broke up (we also unsuccessfully tried again a year later) because of that and religious differences. I had a blind date that broke my God damn heart, which I still regret sometimes when I feel sad and alone. I started messing around with a girl I shouldn't have because I thought she understood me, moved to yet another town, fell into depression and started drinking a big bottle of cheap wine every night. I finally started getting professional help for everything that was going on at this point in my life, and it was an immense help.

25 was a kick in my love life's teeth. I have a lesbian soul sister whose newly-minted ex threw herself at me to make her jealous, and we didn't speak for months. Two girls I was in love with got married, and although I like their husbands, I started to feel the creep-up of old age and regret. After the second one, I had a really bad flashback to the abusive relationship and once again threw myself up on CL--this time, with a guy. It was, as I joke, the most disappointing four inches and four minutes of my entire life. I didn't doubt I was bisexual under more ideal circumstances--but this wasn't it. On a positive note, I found out I was really attracted to trans girls, and was quite happy to expand my repertoire.

26 was going great for a really long time. I came out as queer/questioning/fuckifino to my dad and stepmom, finally finished my degree in journalism, got accepted to grad school, and was learning about other permutations within the QUILTBAG spectrum that seemed to fit better than any explanation I had going at the time. And it was on that high note that I started dating my most recent ex, who was smart, kinky, and loved the fact that I was her little girlfriend or something like that (at least at the outset). Although she gave me a lot of room to explore who I was, the relationship itself was doomed. I finally pulled the plug at the end of May, after seven and a half months.

During that time up to basically now, I have been really messed up. Today was the first time I've seen my therapist in a very long time, and I had been trying to psych myself up to talk about it for a couple reasons:
(1) The aforementioned relationship, which gave me a little bit of freedom to explore my identity.
(2) One of my best friends, who I've known for almost a dozen years, has turned deeply religious (and bigoted) over the last year or two, and was firing off this seven-course meal of copypasta about the dread Homosexual Agenda. I composed a long, thought-out reply to it, which he promptly deleted from his Facebook wall. Our other best friend, the aforementioned roommate of mine, asked him why he was calling people out for repressing his freedom of speech while doing the same to others, and we both got defriended.
(3) I'm staying with my folks between leases right now, and one day my dad came home to find a mess in the kitchen, which set him off. I forget how it happened, but he told me ""You're almost 28 and I'm cleaning up after you. Do your part and quit being such a God damn girl about it,"" which made me angry enough to involuntarily react--slamming my hands down on the sink, making an awful racket because of the fork I was holding. For all the years I had to put up with my asshole stepdad telling me to ""man up"" or ""be a man,"" and considering my apple didn't roll far from his tree, the old man's sudden burst of anger and insensitivity sent me reeling. On the other hand, I'm now much more conscious of using any kind of bigoted slur, so there's that.

35,2012-07-17 06:47:50,wov2z,5,20,"To start this off I should say I was born female, and growing up always felt like my gender fluctuated from time to time. This has brought on a lot of confusion as the years go by.

I remember very distinctly as a child, around 7 or 8 years old, turning to my mom before stepping into a bath and telling her I was a boy. She asked me if I was sure, and I said yes. She told me to look down at myself, at my body, and asked me again if I was sure. I felt terrible over it and for a long time felt really uncomfortable in my own skin. I'm only recently (In the last year or so) starting to feel okay about myself.

My mom comments often on how I'm the best of both worlds, tomboyish and girly all at once. Sometimes I lean more tomboyish, hand me down jeans from an older brother, sports bra and a t-shirt. Other days I feel pretty, slim jeans, scoop neck shirt and maybe a necklace or earrings. Sometimes I'm a boy and sometimes I'm a girl.

Early last year, in January just before my birthday, I cut my hair. I was trying to find out what made me feel right, what made me feel like how I feel inside. It was very short, and after I dropped the scissors I felt... I felt amazing. I felt strong and awesome. It was the first time I'd ever felt like I looked how I was supposed to. Before then my hair was always very long, at least to my lower back.

I walked downstairs and showed my mom. Cue the horrified look, the ""I'm so sorry"" as she assumed I had made some sort of a mistake. Every time somebody I knew looked at me it was always with shock and horror, and I felt like utter shit because of it. I'd finally felt okay with myself and I was getting put down because I didn't look girly anymore.

My best friend at the time would sneer at me and call me butch, would tell me I'd never attract guys with my hair so short (I actually attracted more guys, and was called 'hot' on more than one occasion, something that had never happened before). I've since stopped talking to her because she was a cruel mistress and poisoned my self esteem.

After my hair was cut, I would be mistaken for a boy often. It felt... right, it felt good. I never corrected anybody, I would just smile and feel good. Sometimes the people I was with would laugh afterwards, ""Did you hear that? They called you 'young man'! Hah!"" and I'd laugh with them because the joke was on them, I actually loved it!

My hair has since grown out and is now more medium length than anything. I haven't been mistaken as a guy in a while and that makes me feel kind of sad, I like being androgynous. I'd love to get my hair cut short again but have no idea what hair styles would suit my face, or which styles suit both males and females.

This has brought on a lot of confusion as the years go by.\n\nI remember very distinctly as a child, around 7 or 8 years old, turning to my mom before stepping into a bath and telling her I was a boy. She asked me if I was sure, and I said yes. She told me to look down at myself, at my body, and asked me again if I was sure. I felt terrible over it and for a long time felt really uncomfortable in my own skin. I\'m only recently (In the last year or so) starting to feel okay about myself.\n\nMy mom comments often on how I\'m the best of both worlds, tomboyish and girly all at once. Sometimes I lean more tomboyish, hand me down jeans from an older brother, sports bra and a t-shirt. Other days I feel pretty, slim jeans, scoop neck shirt and maybe a necklace or earrings. Sometimes I\'m a boy and sometimes I\'m a girl.\n\nEarly last year, in January just before my birthday, I cut my hair. I was trying to find out what made me feel right, what made me feel like how I feel inside. It was very short, and after I dropped the scissors I felt... I felt amazing. I felt strong and awesome. It was the first time I\'d ever felt like I looked how I was supposed to. Before then my hair was always very long, at least to my lower back.\n\nI walked downstairs and showed my mom. Cue the horrified look, the ""I\'m so sorry"" as she assumed I had made some sort of a mistake. Every time somebody I knew looked at me it was always with shock and horror, and I felt like utter shit because of it. I\'d finally felt okay with myself and I was getting put down because I didn\'t look girly anymore.\n\nMy best friend at the time would sneer at me and call me butch, would tell me I\'d never attract guys with my hair so short (I actually attracted more guys, and was called \'hot\' on more than one occasion, something that had never happened before). I\'ve since stopped talking to her because she was a cruel mistress and poisoned my self esteem.\n\nAfter my hair was cut, I would be mistaken for a boy often. It felt... right, it felt good. I never corrected anybody, I would just smile and feel good. Sometimes the people I was with would laugh afterwards, ""Did you hear that? They called you \'young man\'! Hah!"" and I\'d laugh with them because the joke was on them, I actually loved it!\n\nMy hair has since grown out and is now more medium length than anything. I haven\'t been mistaken as a guy in a while and that makes me feel kind of sad, I like being androgynous. I\'d love to get my hair cut short again but have no idea what hair styles would suit my face, or which styles suit both males and females. \n\nI don\'t know what this makes me.

41,2012-07-21 21:00:09,wxs5g,3,8,"To preface the story, I'm a bisexual female.

As the title suggests, I'm a bit uncertain about what gender queer really means and because of that I'm not certain if I identify with it. Sorry if my post becomes a bit long winded, I want to make sure I can give everyone an accurate vision of my current level of understanding.

I first came across the term gender queer when a friend (who I have since lost contact with) described herself as such. I tried to get a better understanding of what she meant, since I felt what she described could easily be applied to myself and didn't seem like anything really different. I was never able to fully comprehend the term, and the best description that came up was ""sometimes I feel masculine, sometimes I feel feminine"" with her continuing on saying sometimes she likes wearing dresses, and sometimes she likes wearing pants. 

I am still very much confused as to what exactly being gender queer is like. If I describe myself in terms of 'typically' masculine and feminine things, I fall somewhere in the middle. In terms of dress, it changes daily depending on whether I, myself, feel 'male' or 'female' that day, and I even feel that sometimes my personality changes slightly to exhibit features of the gender I am that day (it's not intentional, however, it feels like a natural change when I'm being myself). Growing up, I was often considered a tomboy. I wore male clothing most of the time, and was often mistaken for being a boy (especially since at the time I had a smaller chest). I'm never mistaken for a guy anymore, but I honestly don't think that I would mind. Even when presenting as female I sometimes wish people wouldn't think of me in terms of gender, but just another person. Perhaps that is a different discussion altogether. 

My boyfriend knows all about me and how I feel, and he was one of the first people I discussed gender queerness with. He also heard my friend's description and says that, from what he can tell, it applies to me. 

During masturbation I sometimes think about having my own penis, and it's a bit difficult trying to describe my feelings around this. I never really considered this as something abnormal (whether it is or not, I don't know). It just feels like sometimes a penis would be good. I don't really have a desire to have one for real, as in trying to get surgery, but I really don't care about having a vagina either. If I woke up male tomorrow, I wouldn't really be phased, and I don't really care either way.

I feel like I fit the description of gender queer (if I'm wrong feel free to correct me). At the same time I don't see the point of it. I'm female, and have no desire to get surgery to become otherwise. Even when I'm wanting to be seen as a guy I feel like it doesn't really matter, because I AM female. I think that a lot of my confusion has to do with the fact that (even when feeling like a different gender) I'm apathetic. I don't care if I'm male, and I don't care if I'm female... and because of that why WOULDN'T I just call myself female, since that at least applies to something physical. I feel like the idea that I may be gender queer irrelevant.

I hope you can understand what I meant in a lot of this post, it's the first time I've ever really tried to express my entire feelings on the subject.

I've changed my name once before, to be rid of my middle name (for my grandmother who being compared to became a family slur for bitchy-ness) as well as my family name (it held the weight of a combination of various negative life/family experiences).

I've been identifying as gender-queer for a while now, at least in private with my SO and therapist, along the bigender spectrum. I usually use my given first and new middle names for the femme side, and two masculine names for the first and middle names on the homme side. I've gotten very comfortable with the contraction of the first-homme name, and have been contemplating incorporating it and/or both homme names into my legal name.

The only issue, I feel, is that it would feel and/or look too long (they actually sound really good together in a particular order). If I were to do that, it would look something like this:

*femme1 femme2 homme2 homme1 surname*

Complicating matters is that my SO and I would like to hyphenate our names eventually, in the event of marriage, which would make it even longer:

*femme1 femme2 homme2 homme1 surname-surname*

I feel that last one is getting into the realm of ridiculousness, but I really want to keep a balance of femme-to-homme names, and can't stand the idea of parting with my middle femme name (although if I have to I will). Does anyone have a suggestion or thoughts on this?

I plan to only use one first name with my surname in day to day life (switching between the two), and picking the femme or homme middle names if I'm particularly one gender or the other that day. I mostly just want to know if anyone thinks this is too pretentious or dumb looking to be buried in legalese somewhere, or if anyone has a suggestion for picking/making something simpler. Perhaps the two first names with a suitably epic ""middle"" name I could use with them both? If that's the case how do I pick something epic enough and not come off as a pretentious douche with a short name versus a pretentious douche with a long name?

For reference, if it helps, the syllables are as follows:

* femme1: 2
* femme2: 2
* homme2: 2
* homme1: 4

Does anyone have a suggestion or thoughts on this?\n\nI plan to only use one first name with my surname in day to day life (switching between the two), and picking the femme or homme middle names if I\'m particularly one gender or the other that day. I mostly just want to know if anyone thinks this is too pretentious or dumb looking to be buried in legalese somewhere, or if anyone has a suggestion for picking/making something simpler. Perhaps the two first names with a suitably epic ""middle"" name I could use with them both? If that\'s the case how do I pick something epic enough and not come off as a pretentious douche with a short name versus a pretentious douche with a long name?\n\nFor reference, if it helps, the syllables are as follows:\n\n* femme1: 2\n* femme2: 2\n* homme2: 2\n* homme1: 4\n* my surname: 1\n* SO\'s surname: 2\n\n**TL;DR** Genderqueer, want to combine male/female names, ending up with ridiculous moniker.

Unfortunately my dilemma is a problem I cannot receive help from any other person. I have very poor memory and/or recall of memories so I cannot gauge how strong these feelings were.

I guess what I would like to know is what it’s like to be genderfluid, is it always changing, does it change every now and then?

Since then I've gotten in with an endocrinologist who has been taking care of me. It has been an awesome experience and with her medical care I've excelled a lot.

My skin is even softer then it was when I was on the IHP stuff, my breasts have shot up another cupsize (I'm close to being a full C) my belly fat is moving out, and my face has changed a lot. 

Shes even been able to help me with my diet based off my blood tests. Telling me specifically what things are affecting my unique blood system. So my weight has finally started to peel off after I plateaued from losing over 100 pounds. 

Every 3 months though, she changes my dose, adjusts brands, sets up a different pattern. 

And it seems like for the first month after these changes, my body and brain goes nuts. I guess this is what having a finally normal female hormone range does, I'm feel like I'm crying all the time for the silliest things. 

Not a depressing cry, but a ""awe so beautiful"" or ""dear god this make sense now."" type cry. 

My hormones have been affecting me emotionally and romantically though too. And right now I think I've scared off one of my Significant others with how I've been acting. She specifically claimed I was ""Acting like a 14 year old girl."" Which I guess I am. 

Right now though, My stomach is turning, I'm guilt ridden, and I feel like I want to vomit. 


I thought this was all over with when I normalized the last time I visited the endo and got an adjustment. But you can't really expect a sudden change of brand, dosage, diet, and exercise, to not make you go crazy. 

I just wish I had more control over it, I don't want to keep losing loved ones every 3 months.
