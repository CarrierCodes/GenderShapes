Even before I found out about trans/nonbinary identities, I felt like I was different from girls my age. It was this strange, isolating feeling that I could never really place. I felt different from everyone else and I had no idea why. 

Then I heard about transgender people. I wondered if I was FTM. I thought about it a lot. At the time I didn't feel like a girl, but I didn't feel like a boy either. So, I continued identifying as female. Mostly because my family hates transgender people, and I think deep down I wished this was just a phase. I was afraid, so I continued to deny my feelings.

Then I heard about a different gender identity. ""Agender"". It was the first nonbinary identity I heard of. It was exciting, realizing I could be whoever I wanted to. I didn't have to decide if I was a ""boy"" or a ""girl"". So I clung to it. My strategy for awhile was ""just identify as agender, try not to think about it that much."" I didn't know who I was, so I tried not to think about it. I didn't want to think about it. So I tried to slap a label on myself that didn't fit quite right, but I decided it was close enough.

Then I thought about what name I wanted to go by. I tried using some gender neutral names for myself, but none of them felt right. But then I tried going by a masculine name. I don't know why, but it just felt perfect. I also realized I prefer he/he him pronouns. I realized I enjoyed being masculine, so I thought ""Well I guess I'm FTM.""

Then I realized I don't feel male either. And that's pretty much where I am now. All I know is I'm not a girl. But everytime I think about my gender I just get overwhelmed and confused. It feels like no label really fits. Am I male? Am I agender? Am I genderfluid, but my gender identity fluctuates very slowly? Am I a demiboy? Am I nonbinary? I have no clue. I've been questioning my gender identity for about a year now and I'm as unsure as I am when I started.

I have been reading some similar posts here about this, but I wanted to see what you all thought of my story. I've been living in a world of depression and anxiety in what has been a life-long quest of finding my identity. Before I begin, please understand I've been heavily conditioned by a very conservative society and am new to all this.

I'm 24 years old (Cancer zodiac) biological male and I've always identified using He/him pronouns (I think that's right), just male and that's it and most of my life I tried to adhere to what society dictated was appropriate behavior for a male. I kept trying to be more masculine through Middle School and High School find love (lifting weights, pretending to care about sports and cars, ect) - I've always been a deep romantic, and many girls loved it - they saw me as a Romeo type, but also something deeper within me. They saw I was different than many guys and that I have many (what are said to be) feminine qualities: Compassion, empathy, intuition, vulnerability, sensuality. I enjoyed being submissive too and to be held as much as I held them.

Later on, all of the LGBT stuff started to become more popular, and I began to hear about different gender identities and such. as I said, I am still VERY new to everything - I come from a super conservative group of friends and family (which terrifies me now). 
 But, I've always found myself being jealous of girls and their beauty, and I would always find myself wondering ""If I could be a girl for a day but still be a guy too, that would be awesome!""

Some days at work I will feel very manly, all gruff and mysterious like, and some days I'll be overwhelmed with a super dee duper bouncy happy-go-lucky feminine energy and I'll spend time reading about beauty products, especially hair, and I will often go on shopping sprees for them -  My brother finds it strange I own more beauty products than my sister in law (minus makeup - I tried eyeliner once and the result was frankenstein. Sad day indeedles)

 I also, sometimes cross dress when I feel really feminine. Girl jeans are possibly the most comfortable jeans I've ever worn, and the hoodies...goodness. SO SOFT and often very cute like my stuffed animals, they're cute too... Anyway, um. I haven't slept so sorry if this is all disorganized and a jumble. 

I just see from the comments you all are so nice and helpful and amazing! I just want to make sense of my feelings... and maybe make new friends :)  

Okie! Thanksss :D

2017-04-11 18:49:25,64su52,0,3,"So recently I had to do a ""What does your name mean?"" project thingy where you had to research your name, it's origin and meaning. To be completely honest, in the beginning of this assignment, I felt down, discouraged even because I am not out to my parents, but I am at school/friends. Now, I absolutely felt disgusted with me having to do my two dead names (First and Middle name). I looked up the name I had made for myself, I look up ""What is the meaning of 'Mikey'?"". The results were not shocking but it still hurt and got me feeling a certain way. Almost always my name will come up as a version of a boys name. I tried looking in many places for the neutral one or at least a female version, but I found none. Did my name even meaning anything, FOR ME? Who was I if my name couldn't even give me reassurance that it was okay to be me. I looked around at my classmates, different emotions for different names. But they all had one thing in common; they felt safe and secure in their own body, because they are automatically safe and ""normal"" in society. I am not. I started hearing everyone else talk about their names happily, and then I started to freak out. I knew I was having a panic attack. I couldn't stop it, the voices of people were getting louder and they wouldn't stop taunting that they were born with a name that felt right and I wasn't. It starting getting harder and harder to breathe and my vision was failing a bit, Without a word, I took the hall pass and ran into the women's bathroom. I locked myself in a stall and began to cry.

To be completely honest, in the beginning of this assignment, I felt down, discouraged even because I am not out to my parents, but I am at school/friends. Now, I absolutely felt disgusted with me having to do my two dead names (First and Middle name). I looked up the name I had made for myself, I look up ""What is the meaning of \'Mikey\'?"". The results were not shocking but it still hurt and got me feeling a certain way. Almost always my name will come up as a version of a boys name. I tried looking in many places for the neutral one or at least a female version, but I found none. Did my name even meaning anything, FOR ME? Who was I if my name couldn\'t even give me reassurance that it was okay to be me. I looked around at my classmates, different emotions for different names. But they all had one thing in common; they felt safe and secure in their own body, because they are automatically safe and ""normal"" in society. I am not. I started hearing everyone else talk about their names happily, and then I started to freak out. I knew I was having a panic attack.

2017-04-12 08:33:05,64wxiq,6,14,"I feel like such an ass posting this, but I haven't really talked about it with anyone and I just need to be able to explain it to myself.

I'm AFAB, and I've always known my gender wasn't quite right. To me, it almost never felt like I was a ""real girl,"" although that was certainly closer than ""boy."" Even my parents said I should have been a boy. Even the kids at school noticed. And me, I tried to be as girly as fucking possible to be a ""good girl,"" and hated it. I convinced myself I liked it, but it was really just relief from the fear of being identified as a freak.

In high school, a friend of mine came out as trans, first by saying she was ""between genders"" and then by transitioning to living as a woman. When she talked about the ""between genders"" stuff that really resonated me, as did talking with another friend who identified the same way in college, but got relentlessly mocked by our friends in our GSA for being a straight cis guy pretending to be queer. He's out and proud as nonbinary now FWIW. So I always knew I wasn't quite cis, but I treated it as a bad thing. I was a freak. I was a failure.

It was talking to friends online and being lead to Tumblr by them that made me put a name to it, and finally use that name for myself. Nonbinary. Initially I did the research, and I didn't think I was genderqueer. I almost never felt fully like a man, and only infrequently felt fully like a woman. Usually, I felt somewhere in between. Where in between changed from day to day, but I thought that was normal for everyone and every gender experienced a certain amount of fluidity. So I called myself first a demiwoman, and then an femandrogyne. At this point I began to flirt with they pronouns.

Accepting myself as being nonbinary was the best thing in my life. I felt so much better. I didn't feel like a fake all the time. When people misgendered me in public, which happens no matter how I am dressed, even as conforming as possible, it felt ok, or even awesome, instead of like I was a failure or a freak (although I'd still sometimes just be going ""WROOONG"" in my head, that took the bite out of it). My mental health improved leaps and bounds, because I was no longer telling myself every day that I was a failure and a freak. But something was still not right.

I realized that some days a skirt and blouse was right and I liked frills, but some days I just wanted jeans and a video game t-shirt. I realized that some days I loved my breasts and some days I hated them. I realized that some days I looked in the mirror and saw a woman and smiled, and some days I frowned, and same for the days I looked in the mirror and saw a man. And I noticed my pronouns for myself would shift. Some days I realized I was thinking of myself as he, though usually it was she or they.

I'm only out to a handful of people, one of whom is ace and has some other trans and nonbinary friends. We were talking about my nonbinary character's pronouns in a tabletop game we do, and somehow it shifted to talking about my pronouns. I said I don't really know what's right for me and I couldn't ask people to keep up with me, but that I was used to ""she/her"" and most of the time ""they/them"" felt good, but ""he/him"" was too uncommon for me to want someone else to use it unless I had already used it that day. 

I really think I'm genderqueer, but the genders I shift between are rarely the ""binary"" ones.

I would estimate my time spent as various ""genders"" as such:

* 35% - Mostly female, little male
* 30% - Evenly between male and female or totally without (I know, two separate things)
* 24% - Mostly male, little female
* 10% - Pure female
* 1% - Pure Male

In terms of pronouns, I find I usually prefer she, almost always find they acceptable and prefer it much of the time, and find myself using ""he"" maybe one day out of four or five, but like hearing other people say it maybe half that. 

So I guess my question is, is having a ""home gender"" where you usually are valid, and is that still valid if that gender's not a binary one, say, femandrogyne? Am I really genderfluid if I'm shifting between dark and light gray instead of black and white, so to speak?

I started to identify agender or fluid or something and I felt “wow thats just what it is”. But it also made another feeling surface. A huge sadness. Or at least this sadness was before associated with different topics. 

Now i think, feeling not-male makes me sad because i don’t know how to response to so called male problems, which are basically the problems people develop when trying to adopt masculine identities. Problems i also had and i guess still have.

For example In subredit menslib discussions, they suggest that it would be possible to distinguish between toxic/bad and better/good masculinities, a point I basically agree on.

Summarizing, my problem doesn't lie exactly in my dissatisfaction with feminine looks, I'm fine with them. In fact, I kind of can't imagine myself looking masculine, or at least not right now... like permanently changing my appearance to a masculine one would feel ""not me"".

But I have some fantasies about interacting with people as a guy (I've been having those fantasies recently). Like sometimes I feel like I would love to date a guy as a guy. I am bisexual btw. And I know this is hella confusing - I think I would enjoy dating women both as a woman or as a man; I like PiV and prefer having sex with men as a woman, I can't imagine myself turned on by another guy as a guy... but sometimes I feel like I would have a closer emotional connection with men dating them as a guy. It can sound fucking strange I know... but it is just how it is.

I kind of don't want to post it in /asktransgender because I honestly feel like there might be people there who will try to make me swallow the idea that I am 100% trans, or just a ""FtM in denial"". Whereas I am  very sure that my gender issues are much, much more nuanced than that. 

In fact, I don't relate fully to either gender. I feel more comfortable around women/female relatives in the sense I feel they understand more my language etc, and I am more ""similar"" to them in verbal communication. But even then I feel like there are a lot of interests I don't share with my female peers. There are days when I feel like I want to act very masculine for some hours. I kind of repress this masculine side, but sometimes it pops up. Then for weeks or months I come back to my make up focused self, loving fashion magazines and stuff. 

Actually I'm very confused right now. Haha

It can sound fucking strange I know... but it is just how it is.\n\nI kind of don\'t want to post it in /asktransgender because I honestly feel like there might be people there who will try to make me swallow the idea that I am 100% trans, or just a ""FtM in denial"". Whereas I am  very sure that my gender issues are much, much more nuanced than that. \n\nIn fact, I don\'t relate fully to either gender. I feel more comfortable around women/female relatives in the sense I feel they understand more my language etc, and I am more ""similar"" to them in verbal communication. But even then I feel like there are a lot of interests I don\'t share with my female peers. There are days when I feel like I want to act very masculine for some hours. I kind of repress this masculine side, but sometimes it pops up. Then for weeks or months I come back to my make up focused self, loving fashion magazines and stuff. \n\nActually I\'m very confused right now.

I just wanted to say that I totally appreciate the answers I get from this group when I post questions.

2017-04-17 19:23:33,65xpyv,3,7,"Hi, all. I'm 19 years old, AFAB, and have been on testosterone for 8 months now. 
When I was first introduced to gender identities other than male or female, I was very put off by it. Gender fluidity especially confused and scared me (and still does). I've usually been comfortable being seen as male, using he/him/his pronouns and having body/facial hair. My whole family and all of my friends have been referring to me as a male for years. I love being on T. 

Here is my dilemma: 
sometimes I don't feel dysphoric or male at all and I don't know what to do during these periods of time. My dysphoria is usually present and I want a male body and use male pronouns and wear male clothes, and then some days, I feel very femme and don't feel like male pronouns fit me quite right and I much prefer they/them/their. It's like my dysphoria lifts away and I feel totally comfortable as a female. I panic so badly because I feel like my whole life has been a lie. 

I thought at first it meant I must've been faking the entire transgender thing and I was really a female all along and in these periods of time, I deeply regret transitioning and wish I had never done it. It keeps me up at night and makes me feel sick with fear and an intense longing to go back in time. 
But, after a week or two, the feeling fades and I'm fine being male again. This has been happening for many years and I've never told anyone because I brushed it off as being a moody teenager or a product of my mental illness. Now, I'm on very good medications and feel amazing but these shifts still happen and it terrifies me.

I've never wanted to question my gender after coming out the first time. The thought of not being binary scares the shit out of me and my friends and family all know me as being openly hateful toward people who identify as such. I feel like the typical ""homophobe bully who turns out to be gay"" trope. 

I never want to stop taking T because I feel so much happier in my body than ever before and my periods of joy last much longer than my periods of regret, but I would really love to experiment more with my pronouns and my clothing. I'm even letting my hair grow out after keeping it short for 7 years. I'm just so afraid and feel like I would be imposing on the people who are just now seeing me as a real male. I just can't ignore these massive dysphoria shifts anymore because it's driving me crazy and making me so anxious.

My questions are: does this sound like gender fluidity? How can I learn to accept this and stop feeling so awful every time I feel femme?

Even though I only did so to a small group of friends and plan to slowly add more trustworthy people (more on that later). So thought I'd share my experience the last month.

    1. Making the post/reactions

The most stressful part of all was hitting ""post"" and waiting for the responses which I quickly jumped to respond to. I actually posted it twice since the first time nobody said anything but they liked it. Again, everyone was 100% supportive and totally cool with it, and in fact I've become somewhat closer to them.

    2. Expressing myself outside

I experimented with certain clothes and products outside of the safety if my room (nail polish, women's skinny jeans, some makeup) and nobody said a thing or took a second look (it's college so I guess that makes sense). I'm still quite nervous about going out with full outfits and whatnot but taking baby steps is easier.

    3. Harassment

This is the ""more on that"". About 2/3 weeks ago I got a random text where a person I wasn't out to, found out. All this time later I've gotten numerous texts from different numbers (I'm assuming fake numbers) telling me a whole bunch of stuff ranging from ""die"" to ""I've seen your posts about me on [private instagram]"". I can care less about the insults and what not, my main concern is just finding out who this is. I have different theories but none of them make much sense (I can make another post regarding that if y'all want). It caused a friendship to end. It's hard talking about it to everyone since I'm not out to everyone, and I don't feel comfortable telling the police (although if it gets serious I will). Best bet is change my number for a 2nd time.

    4. It still feels weird...

Even a month after coming out it still feels weird making those posts and sharing the pictures of the genderqueer me. A friend mentioned it's because for all this time it's been a secret so my brain is still used to it like that. Also since coming out I've had less dysphoria, and if I do it comes not as often.


----------------------
I still have an interesting journey ahead of me. Next semester I plan on joining my LGBT club at school (I signed up this semester but haven't heard a thing :/), I plan on telling more people (but since #3 I'm going to be very selective), go shopping for more female clothes (because I have one outfit) and start to go out more with friends in my female side once summer break starts and everyone is home.

Also since coming out I\'ve had less dysphoria, and if I do it comes not as often.\n\n\n----------------------\nI still have an interesting journey ahead of me. Next semester I plan on joining my LGBT club at school (I signed up this semester but haven\'t heard a thing :/), I plan on telling more people (but since #3 I\'m going to be very selective), go shopping for more female clothes (because I have one outfit) and start to go out more with friends in my female side once summer break starts and everyone is home.\n\nEdit: format\n', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'One month of being out... my experiences (x-post genderqueer)', 'created': 1492851132.0}"

2017-04-26 18:40:52,67q5e0,6,3,"Hi, everyone.

I am 30, AMAB, and I live in (of all places for this) Kentucky. I am not personally responsible for bringing you the train wrecks that are Kim Davis, Mitch McConnell, Rand Paul, or even ""Papa"" John Schnatter, but one day I do hope to, metaphorically or otherwise, kick their asses.

Anyway, I've been out for a few weeks as genderfluid, and if I had to choose, I actually don't... well, I'd choose androgynous. This is all new to me. I feel like myself for the first time since I was a teenager. I'm taking this pretty slow and I do suspect that maybe one day I might want to transition but that scares the hell out of me and I feel like I might be too old for it. But I digress...

Thing is, the questions I'm getting from people are ones I don't really know how to answer. I'm pretty sure you all have had them though, so I thought maybe I'd pass them up the chain and see if you all could help me articulate with words what I can't seem to express myself.

- Isn't 'feeling female' or 'feeling male' itself based in assigned gender roles? Does this not, in and of itself, diminish feminism and your own personal empowerment?

- What is the difference in this and you having a split personality? Are there two of you? Do I need to call a dude in a white jacket with a big net to put you in a hug-me coat to have you--both of you, I mean--put in a room with special walls?

- So is 'gender' a 'feeling' to you? Is it just 'I woke up today feeling like a lady?'

I've tried to explain these points and I'm blue in the face. They mostly get it and mostly support me, which is awesome--especially considering where I live--but there seem to be barriers to understanding that I just can't get through all the way.

Thanks, everyone.
