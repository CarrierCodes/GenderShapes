I would love to gather some insight on creative ways to make my genderfluid cis-female partner feel as attractive as I find her to be! We've been friends for a while and are now working toward a more physical and emotionally serious relationship. I would so appreciate, for example, suggestions of questions to ask that show I care (and perhaps things to avoid if you can think of common sensitive stereotypes or hurtful inquiries I might not be aware of). 

Also, I just love her originality and trying things with her that are new for me, but she often hesitates or grows very nervous when it comes to sexual situations. I really want to cultivate a safe space for us! Suggestions for compliments or ways/actions to show her how sexy I find her would be incredibly helpful. 

FTR, I am a cis-female femme, and again she is cis-female genderfluid. She prefers female pronouns but sexually prefers neutral or slightly masculine compliments (i.e. ""Strong"" or ""dashing"") and exhibits a more dominant sexuality.

2017-01-12 15:07:04,5njtue,22,16,"So I used to identify as mtf, but I wasnt entirely sure. And as I've come to accept my non-cis identity lately, things have become more clear to me and my depression has lessen a bit. Until a month ago I still felt like I really wanted to be a girl and start hrt, but two weeks ago I suddenly start to feel ""normal"", like I can just keep being a guy for the rest of my life (probably because I met a girl that I really like and so I thought I will be better off staying a male). Before I sometimes thought that I could keep being a guy as well, but this time it's REAL. Before I never liked it seeing myself wearing male clothing and my masculine body, but recently I'm COMPLETELY ok with it. 



But for the past two days my feeling has fluctuated the most. I will wake up, touching my hair and feel like a girl, then have breakfast and feel like a guy, and change back to a girl, back and forth like this... And this is what made me realize that I might be genderfluid, and it feels more ""right"" than calling myself a trans.



So now the question is, should I start HRT? 


I ALWAYS want to be a girl, its just that sometimes the desire isnt as strong and I feel like being a guy is ok, and sometimes its not there at all. But even then, I'd still prefer to be a girl, its just a matter of whether I feel like I can settle living as a guy. And my dysphoria about my male body comes and goes as well, it used to be there all the time, recently it started to fluctuate.


So basically, the ideal situation for me is to be a biological female, but sometimes being more masculine sometimes being more feminine. I used to feel really confused about this, I still like to look cool as a girl, and act tough and manly, but still have feminine features like long hair, breasts and curves. 



If someone can make me a girl with magic, I would do it without hesitation. So the reason that Im still struggling with starting hrt or not is how life will be tougher and I might not be able to pass. Sometimes my dysphoria is real bad that I dont care about these and I just want to transition. Sometimes its not there as much and I feel like even tho it sounds good, I dont know if it will worth it.



TL;DR:     I know no one can make the decision for me, so I just wanna know how other genderfluid people deal with this? Sometimes it feels ok to keep being your assigned gender and you are glad that you never start HRT, but some other times you want it so bad but also worry that you might regret it once you feelings change back... Part of me want to start hrt tomorrow as I fear that the chance for me passing is getting lower and lower, but the other part of me worries that I might regret it... not because of the feminine changes but the tough future, the reality.

2017-01-26 22:46:59,5qdfev,0,13,"Hello,
My name is Laurel Watson, and I am an assistant professor of counseling psychology at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. I am currently conducting a study investigating transgender individuals’ experiences of discrimination, stress, and psychological outcomes. In order to participate, you must a) identify as an individual of transgender experience (for example, gender queer, trans woman, trans man, nonbinary trans individual, gender fluid, and so on), b) be 18 years of age or older, and c) be able to read the English language. 

If you are interested in participating, you will be asked to complete an anonymous online survey that will take approximately 30 to 40 minutes, one time only. If you are interested in participating, please click on the following link: 

https://umkc.co1.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_0liN59ACkKy6xZb

For your participation, you may choose to enter a raffle to win one of four $25.00 Amazon.com gift cards. In addition, a $2 donation to a local organization serving transgender individuals (Kansas City Anti-Violence Project) will be made for each participant, for a maximum of $650.

This study, protocol number 16-113, has been approved by University of Missouri, Kansas City’s Institutional Review Board. If you have any concerns about your rights as a participant your concerns please call 816-235-5927.

I look forward to sharing the results of this study with you, and I am hopeful that the results can help further important policy change that supports transgender peoples’ lives.

2017-01-27 05:12:13,5qfd01,5,2,"Hi Reddit,  

So this is definitely something new to me.  I am biologically female but have slowly begun realizing that I am genderfluid.  The only one I've talked to about this is my wife and she is very supportive of me.  

For as long as I can remember I have always hated having boobs and typically have always worn a sports bra.  I am most of the time completely uncomfortable and unhappy with having the physical appearance of a feminine chest.  My wife suggested I start binding if I want to, but I have never done so, nor do I know anyone who does.  

I guess what I am trying to say is that I honestly would like some advice on binding.  Does anyone have any recommendations how I might start?  

Thanks for reading and helping.

So what kind of haircuts do you all recommend? I haven't told anyone yet, and am still exploring. So if you got pictures or links, I'd love to see!

Maybe label them based on what you think looks either more Feminine or Masculine. Something easy to maintain, but cute too, I know it depends on the face. But Blah!

I guess I'm mostly looking for ways whereby I can have elements of femininity about myself while still appearing generally masculine. 

Examples so far include painting my fingernails, wearing bracelets and necklaces, and I'm growing my hair out under the (actually accurate) guise of wanting to donate it to cancer patients after a couple years, which will give me a lot of options there. All of those are things that are at least mostly socially acceptable for males, but that soothe my inner girl when she's wanting to be let out. 

Are there any others that you use as coping mechanisms?
