I'm AMAB, but I've been dabbling in my feminine side for a little over a year now, wearing skirts basically every day, and I've been painting my nails for a few months now. Very androgynous style overall, but leaning more towards feminine.

Anyways, I've always been the class clown type. Quick to make a joke, never takes anything seriously, very self decapritating sense of humor (anxiety and depression are much easier to deal with this way, haha). I've long loathed the ""Dude in a dress"" joke that's become commonplace, but I also joke about my own femininity all the time. I have absolutely no shame in what I do, totally comfortable with everything, and I don't mind people cracking jokes about my gender identity provided they aren't mean about it, but lately I've come to realize that maybe I'm not taking this seriously enough?

I mean, I'll never stop making fun of myself, that's just how I am, but I don't want people to think I'm wearing dresses and makeup as a joke, I want at least the respect to do my own thing. However, I don't want people who make fun of me to think that it's ok to laugh at ANYONE who cross dresses, because gender identity can be very sensitive for some people. 

I'm kinda ranting now, and I don't really know how to end this, but I hope this makes sense?

The hair loss is something I am usually fine with. Mostly I miss the option of growing my hair more than the actual having of hair. 

Lately, though, it has been my facial hair that is a major source of frustration. I've been bearded for over a decade, with only a few stages where I've trimmed right down or changed it up for a Halloween costume, and a couple complete shaves followed by immediate re growing of the beard. 

I love my beard. I think I look great with a beard.

2017-03-14 22:37:16,5zfhmg,2,4,"Hey gang! I had a great weekend this weekend and I had a shitty weekend last weekend and I wanted to share these experiences with you. I'm AMAB and I'm genderqueer/genderfluid. My sex is male and I am very happy being male and I don't want to transition to female, however when I wake up in girl mode, I like to express it through the way I dress. Hair and makeup is too much for me but I love doing my nails. I'm also an albino and I am blind.

It started last Thursday when I went to see my doctor. You see I'm on this huge mission to improve myself both mentally and physically so I thought I'd get started by losing weight and getting my diet right so I can start working out at the gym in a few months. I've got a few other steps to take before I get to that point. Anyways, I've been weighing myself at a friend's house because he has a digital scale and I can easily read the numbers. I replaced the batteries to ensure I'd get accurate readings. When they weighed me at the doctor's office, they were telling me I was about 8 pounds heavier than I thought I was. The scale at home told me I was 166 and the doctor's scale was telling me 174. I asked the nurse if I could pull the scale into the exam room so I could weigh myself like I do over there and he said sure. (BTW: the nurse is really cute and I have a hard time resisting the urge to hit on him!) I stripped off my clothes and stepped up on the scale and fiddled with the weights until I got it balanced. 172 was the magic number. This made me feel sad because I was so thrilled to be below 170. I know it's only a couple pounds but I've been working really hard at eating the best I can and staying away from sweet treats (I feel bad, I get an apple juice and a peanut butter egg). Finding this out pretty much let the air out of my tires. 

Fast forward to the next day and I get on the bus and see my favorite bus driver. I tell her what happened at the doctor's office and I told her that I feel fat and sad today. She started laughing hysterically and I couldn't figure out why and it was starting to irritate me a little bit when she calmed down somewhat and told me that I'm having PMS! I was like ""Whaaaaaat?!?!?"" She said all the symptoms I described are about how she feels when her Aunt Flo comes to visit once a month. I started giggling and told her that I'm so much like a woman! It made me feel a little bit better but all weekend long it kinda nagged at me and I didn't start feeling better until about Tuesday of this week. On Saturday I did do something fun for myself in an effort to cheer me up a little bit. I had gotten some 8 guage circular barbells a few weeks ago and I stopped by a piercing shop to get them put back in my ears. It's been a loooooong time since I've worn earrings and since I can't see my own face in the mirror (it's like looking at a face of a mannequin) and the holes needed to be stretched a little bit, instead of ripping my ears off I opted to let a professional do it. After it was done, I was out and about running some other errands and I could feel the weight of them in my ears again and it started to put a smile on my face. Tuesday when I woke up and felt them, I was really happy I did it and it's encouraging me to get more piercings.

Fast forward a little further to Saturday night. I was on telegram with some friends and we started talking about doing nails and whatnot. We started making tentative plans to meet at a friend's place the next day but we never hammered out a time before I fell asleep. I woke up the next morning and we all started talking about it again and we nailed down a time to meet. I was about 20 minutes late getting there but I had such an awesome time! It was me and three other friends of mine, one girl, one guy, and one person. We spent the better part of the afternoon just gossiping, hanging out, smoking cannabis, drinking mimosas, and doing our nails. My guy friend didn't do his nails because he's an airplane mechanic and his nails would be destroyed the next time he went to work. He's also a little self conscious about it because he just recently started this job and he loves it. Later that evening I got hungry and walked down the street to Little Caesar's Pizza and came back with a bunch of pizzas for everyone. I also wanted to show off my new nails too! :) It's been awhile since I've seen these guys because I've been on a sabbatical of self improvement and I'm getting comfortable enough to start sticking my head out from under the rock I'm hiding at to start seeing people on a small basis. I really wanted to wait until I had the whole package (mind, body, and spirit) before I popped up again, but a lot of these people are like family to me and I've been missing my family as of lately. We're all going to a convention at the end of July and I so can't wait to go and see the rest of my family and make some new friends.

So that's it. I just wanted to share with you guys because I'm having such a blast being my true self and I hope this experience will give y'all the courage to start being the people you want to be. Y'all do me a favor and have an awesome day!

Take care!

For example, if I as a straight woman were to date a pre-op FTM partner I would still be in a straight relationship. I would assume labeling this otherwise would be disrespectful against my partner's gender. 


Thus, as someone who is genderfluid, how could you be gay unless you were also attracted to other genderfluid people? Otherwise you would be gay as defined by your sex, which would be disrespectful to your own gender identity?

2017-03-21 08:01:44,60mcgs,2,7,"Sorry, wall of text ahead.

To start, I don't identify as male, but I don't feel comfortable identifying as female either (yes, I'm genderfluid). I occasionally switch but for the most part I'm content to consider myself as containing both genders simultaneously. It's a complicated feeling and I still don't entirely understand it, but I'm coming to accept it, and slowly learning how to express it so that other people might begin to understand. Generally, I look like a feminine man wearing women's clothes. Although I more identify as a masculine woman wearing woman's clothes, I feel like I more or less make my point. 

Not everything has been perfect since I came out. I went out during the daylight hours this last weekend and I was met with my fair share of stares. I live in Tampa, which isn't exactly a bastion of progressivism (even on the St. Pete side of the bridge, where I was, even though it's generally better there). There were even some guys on the street who approached my girlfriend and I who were borderline hostile. My family doesn't accept me or my ""alternative lifestyle"", and I still haven't been able to bring myself to come out on facebook or to people at work who aren't sympathetic or accepting. Nevertheless! I wouldn't take it back for anything. Not for a moment.

This weekend I participated in an alternative fashion show and not everybody there was 100% on board with me or what I was doing or how I looked but by the end of the night, everybody was at least willing to accept me for what I am, and they gave so much love. I keep looking at the pictures. I can't stop. I'm still having a hard time believing it's actually real. That I'm really doing what I'm doing. Yet here I am. There is photographic proof, and I couldn't be happier about it.

I couldn't even imagine this would be my life a year ago. Not in my wildest dreams. I am out. So out. I've dreamed of this, flirted with it, pretended that it wasn't what I wanted, done literally everything except actually coming out of the closet for 27 years. Wow. Yet here I am. I feel beautiful. I feel like, you know when you find the last corner in a particularly large jigsaw puzzle? Something like that. The puzzle isn't totally put together but there is hope! For the first time in my life I genuinely feel like there is hope for me to be actually, genuinely happy.

I've found acceptance in places I could have never dreamed. All because I finally put on a dress and stepped outside. I went outside! I faced the world! And for the most part the world greeted me with a giant hug! I never, never, believed for a moment this was possible. I came out to my parents! My southern baptist family knows who I am, and they are not okay with it but they're dealing with it? They didn't disown me?

I have an amazingly accepting girlfriend and I know that I'm lucky. So lucky. It's scary and exciting especially because I've been down this road before and felt this love before and been betrayed by the allies who said they supported me. Discovering that the people who claimed to accept you were mocking you behind your back is painful in a way I'm sure you can imagine. I was so scared of that happening again that I hid for almost a decade. 

Maybe you've been there before, maybe not. All I can say now is don't give those people any purchase in your life or happiness or self acceptance. You are who you are. You are beautiful the way you are. Be happy. It's worth it. Yes, even with all the love around me I have to remind myself sometimes, but it's still worth it!
As queer humans, despite politics, despite hate, despite everything, or maybe even because of it, this is our time. Do not hide! There is no time or use for shame or self doubt. Let's show the world that we are here and we will not be silent. Let's show the world that there is another way, that life isn't binary, neither are we, and we will not submit to a life with arbitrary walls. 

I love each and every one of you, genuinely, and hope with all of my heart that this brings you strength and happiness and positivity.

One love. One human race. &lt;3

tl;dr Be strong! Be happy! Share love!

I occasionally switch but for the most part I\'m content to consider myself as containing both genders simultaneously. It\'s a complicated feeling and I still don\'t entirely understand it, but I\'m coming to accept it, and slowly learning how to express it so that other people might begin to understand. Generally, I look like a feminine man wearing women\'s clothes. Although I more identify as a masculine woman wearing woman\'s clothes, I feel like I more or less make my point. \n\nNot everything has been perfect since I came out. I went out during the daylight hours this last weekend and I was met with my fair share of stares. I live in Tampa, which isn\'t exactly a bastion of progressivism (even on the St. Pete side of the bridge, where I was, even though it\'s generally better there). There were even some guys on the street who approached my girlfriend and I who were borderline hostile. My family doesn\'t accept me or my ""alternative lifestyle"", and I still haven\'t been able to bring myself to come out on facebook or to people at work who aren\'t sympathetic or accepting. Nevertheless! I wouldn\'t take it back for anything. Not for a moment.\n\nThis weekend I participated in an alternative fashion show and not everybody there was 100% on board with me or what I was doing or how I looked but by the end of the night, everybody was at least willing to accept me for what I am, and they gave so much love. I keep looking at the pictures. I can\'t stop. I\'m still having a hard time believing it\'s actually real. That I\'m really doing what I\'m doing. Yet here I am. There is photographic proof, and I couldn\'t be happier about it.\n\nI couldn\'t even imagine this would be my life a year ago. Not in my wildest dreams. I am out. So out. I\'ve dreamed of this, flirted with it, pretended that it wasn\'t what I wanted, done literally everything except actually coming out of the closet for 27 years. Wow. Yet here I am. I feel beautiful. I feel like, you know when you find the last corner in a particularly large jigsaw puzzle? Something like that. The puzzle isn\'t totally put together but there is hope! For the first time in my life I genuinely feel like there is hope for me to be actually, genuinely happy.\n\nI\'ve found acceptance in places I could have never dreamed. All because I finally put on a dress and stepped outside. I went outside! I faced the world! And for the most part the world greeted me with a giant hug! I never, never, believed for a moment this was possible. I came out to my parents! My southern baptist family knows who I am, and they are not okay with it but they\'re dealing with it? They didn\'t disown me?\n\nI have an amazingly accepting girlfriend and I know that I\'m lucky. So lucky. It\'s scary and exciting especially because I\'ve been down this road before and felt this love before and been betrayed by the allies who said they supported me. Discovering that the people who claimed to accept you were mocking you behind your back is painful in a way I\'m sure you can imagine. I was so scared of that happening again that I hid for almost a decade. \n\nMaybe you\'ve been there before, maybe not.

Basically as context, I'm 99% sure I'm not cis at this point, and I still get that occasional ""Hmm, am I right about that?"" and question myself every now and then when I feel male (though I've become more comfortable with it since last month and I'm questioning it less and just accepting it). I also started a journal that I write in to try and understand myself day to day, and I've noticed that there are actually days when I feel agender, which is interesting, since I didn't think I felt that before I started the journal. I've also came out as questioning to my close friends, and they were so accepting I actually felt humbled! I'm glad to have such great friends!

Anyway, there are times when I feel female when I start thinking ""Maybe I'm actually transgender?"", and I've heavily considered the issue. After all, for some reason I seem to enjoy (in a way) feeling female more than feeling male (AMAB), but I've dismissed it since I don't really experience any dysphoria, I just would have *preferred* to have been born female. Is this normal?
Also, the other day I read a post where someone described themselves as ""Feel too female to be a male, but feel to male to want to change my body or anything"", and I feel like I relate to that quite a bit, especially when I feel more female.
Interestingly, too, in those times when I start to think I may be transgender, I get this feeling that I *want* to be transgender rather than genderfluid, which is odd, because I know this thing isn't a choice (I don't even get a choice on what gender I feel like from day to day). It makes me afraid that I sound like a faker typing that, but I'm just trying to be as honest as possible.
I think another part of the issue is that I think that people would be more accepting if I was transgender than if I was genderfluid, but I also don't want to let other people's perceptions interrupt how I feel about myself

Also, I'm still as afraid as I was last month that this is just a phase in growing up (I'm 16, will be 17 in the next month) and that I'll come out as genderfluid (or transgender, I'm still questioning, but I'm 99% sure I'm not cis) and then when I'm like 25 I'll be looking back at my 17 year old self and realising how wrong I was, and I'll be afraid to approach my teenage friends and be like ""yeah... I was wrong, I'm actually cis"". On the other hand though, I realise that this kind of thing is hard to just put down as being a phase, as gender identity is fairly permanent, and I can imagine myself still being genderfluid when I'm 25. I can imagine myself being genderfluid in 10 years, but I can also see myself being cis, it's strange. Does anybody have any advice on this? Is this a sign that I'm actually cis or is it normal when questioning? I don't want to seem like I'm questioning myself for the trend or anything, but occasionally I question whether I'm genderfluid at all or if I'm just a poser (especially when I feel male)

Could you please be as honest as possible in your answers; I'd rather be told I'm wrong than believe something that's not true

I really appreciate all the help I've gotten from this subreddit so far, and I'm eternally grateful! Thank you all so much! :)

2017-03-28 04:04:48,61x64x,8,8,"(Sorry in advance for the wall of text)

Okay, so background: I'm 21, AMAB, and started questioning my gender about two-ish years ago when I learned about trans people and transitioning, and it suddenly seemed like the feelings I'd had since puberty made perfect sense. I then spent about a year questioning whether or not I actually wanted to do anything transition-wise. Eventually, I decided to talk a bit with a therapist to figure out where I wanted to go next, which led me to set up an appointment for feminizing hormone therapy. At the time, I wasn't entirely sure if I was binary, but I knew I was uncomfortable with the gender I'd been assigned and figured I'd see where transition led me.

Skip ahead four months from when I started Spiro/Estradiol, and now I'm having a bit of trouble. I was feeling pretty shit this past weekend to start with due to a sinus headache. But it got even worse yesterday when I woke up and found that the breast development I've gotten, which I'd always been happy about before, was causing a familiar sense of dysphoria.

I've spent the past two days basically just wondering what to do from here. Even with the newfound chest dysphoria, my previous dysphoria over masculine features like body/facial hair and genitals didn't seem to drop at all. It was like I just didn't want *any* gendered features. Then, come this evening, I reexamined of my breast development and decided I honestly wouldn't mind if they were a bit larger. :/

So now I'm wondering if this was a one-time thing brought on my the general misery that accompanied my sinus headache, or if this shifting gender identity is something I should expect to come up every now and then for the foreseeable future. Unfortunately, I don't really have access to a gender therapist from my current location; although, I do have my university counseling center, which is full of LGBT allies who I should at least be able to talk to for some general support.

**TL;DR:** I guess I'm looking to learn about other people's experiences with genderfluidity so I can hopefully get a better idea of where I'm at and what options I might want to research. Any personal stories, advice, links to relevant resources, etc. would be greatly appreciated.

(One other thing that may or may not be relevant/make sense: I did kinda suspect I might have some not-entirely-binary gender identity based on past introspective experiences. A few years back, I developed two internal ""ideas of self"" - if that makes any sense. One version of me was female; the other was genderless. So I figured that perhaps my actual gender identity lay somewhere in between those two. I didn't really think there was a chance it might be *both* of them. But I guess there's not much reason to question if you're genderfluid when you're pre-transition and the genders you experience would both be dysphoric with the one you were assigned? &gt;~&lt;)",genderfluid,genderfluid questioning?,1490699088.0,"{'created_utc': 1490673888, 'id': '61x64x', 'num_comments': 8, 'score': 8, 'selftext': '(Sorry in advance for the wall of text)\n\nOkay, so background: I\'m 21, AMAB, and started questioning my gender about two-ish years ago when I learned about trans people and transitioning, and it suddenly seemed like the feelings I\'d had since puberty made perfect sense.

Then, come this evening, I reexamined of my breast development and decided I honestly wouldn\'t mind if they were a bit larger. :/\n\nSo now I\'m wondering if this was a one-time thing brought on my the general misery that accompanied my sinus headache, or if this shifting gender identity is something I should expect to come up every now and then for the foreseeable future. Unfortunately, I don\'t really have access to a gender therapist from my current location; although, I do have my university counseling center, which is full of LGBT allies who I should at least be able to talk to for some general support.\n\n**TL;DR:** I guess I\'m looking to learn about other people\'s experiences with genderfluidity so I can hopefully get a better idea of where I\'m at and what options I might want to research. Any personal stories, advice, links to relevant resources, etc. would be greatly appreciated.\n\n(One other thing that may or may not be relevant/make sense: I did kinda suspect I might have some not-entirely-binary gender identity based on past introspective experiences. A few years back, I developed two internal ""ideas of self"" - if that makes any sense. One version of me was female; the other was genderless. So I figured that perhaps my actual gender identity lay somewhere in between those two. I didn\'t really think there was a chance it might be *both* of them. But I guess there\'s not much reason to question if you\'re genderfluid when you\'re pre-transition and the genders you experience would both be dysphoric with the one you were assigned? &gt;~&lt;)', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'genderfluid questioning?', 'created': 1490699088.0}"
