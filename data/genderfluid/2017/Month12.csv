Because while I socially love being a gentleman just as much as being a lady, I just like the female body more. With the exception of genitals, women just have all the features I find more desirable for myself. Curves, soft skin, less body hair, rounder face, little to no facial hair, the inherently more open resting expression that comes with the lack of a brow ridge, etc. etc. (oh, and BOOBS. I cannot express enough how much I want a pair of those)

I definitely want to be able to present myself ""passibly"" as either of the binary genders, but in a perfect world, I'd be a non-srs trans woman when I'm naked.

The problem is I can't really justify the difficulty, expensive sperm banking, and health risks of HRT when I'm not looking to fully transition. There's Breast Augmentation, but that only addresses one of the many factors that make me prefer the feminine body, plus we're talking about a much larger upfront cost, resulting in boobs that would lack female nipple development, and which I'd feel less safe binding for masculine presentation.

2017-12-06 16:27:07,7hz4b4,5,15,"Hey people. I'm new. Just feeling a bit overwhelmed with a variety of different feelings. Needed to post. Feel free to respond. Or not. Whatever makes you feel good.

I am 31-years-old now and AFAB, but had (until relatively recently) been struggling with my gender identity, ever since I was a very small child. I almost always felt like a boy. I wanted to play football -- BEGGED my parents to let me play football. I liked playing in the dirt and went shirtless until my parents told me it was no longer appropriate to go shirtless (not because they were trying to conform me, but because I was blossoming into female form and society doesn't accept women to be shirtless). I just really felt like I was male most of the time. They never really ever asked me how I felt and wanted to be perceived. Mainly because they weren't that aware of gender identity crises; they were and still are very liberal and accepting of all people. I think they just weren't aware that some people are non-binary. They are baby boomers from the Midwest, they just weren't exposed to it as they were growing up, getting married, and starting to have children. 

So, they just let me do life. When I was old enough to start dressing myself there was a bit of a struggle, because they wanted me to look pretty (especially my mom, I am her first-born daughter and she is VERY into fashion). She always let me play boy-like and with more boy-oriented toys, but when it came to dressing, she just wanted a girl to play dress up with. And I hated it. I wanted to wear baggy jeans and t-shirts (and go shirtless outside in the heat of the Midwestern summers). 

I suppose that when I started puberty they expected me to be a lesbian. In fact, they had to have been gearing up for that. But I surprised everyone. I was (and still am) almost exclusively attracted to males. But I still felt boyish most of the time. I should definitely clarify that I certainly did (and still do) at times feel female, but I was unaware of the concept of fluidity, so it was all just very confusing. I wanted to be with males sexually, but otherwise mostly felt like I was male too. But not in a male-homosexual way. I enjoyed having a vagina when feeling sexual or thinking about sex, but otherwise my general identity would mostly feel male, occasionally female. 

Anyway, I lived (romantically and sexually, up to this point with no regrets or expectations of change) a pretty normal life. I became sexually active at seventeen, and was almost exclusively heterosexual (except for one drunken experience in college, which is SO cliche, but it's true, in which I took part in a MFF threesome. And I discovered that I am definitely not interested in sex with females. But I'm glad I tried it. And yes I told my parents about it! And they really didn't mind that I had done it, but didn't like hearing about their daughter's sexual experiences.

I got married a week before my 29th birthday to a wonderful man. I love him more than I thought I could ever love anyone. He is my best friend. And I LOVE being sexual with him. And I feel like a very sexy woman when we are being sexual. I don't ever feel male when we are making love. But most of the other time, with some exception, I feel male. 

A few years ago, I came to the knowledge and understanding of the concept of genderfluidity and it finally felt like I had a home. A way to describe myself and the way I view myself. It was so freeing to know that there was a word for the way I felt, but to also know that there are many others who feel the same way.

So anyway, last night my husband and I sort of stumbled into a conversation about my sexual identity, and I just had to come out to him. I felt like I was hiding this horrible secret from him. I hadn't come out to anyone yet. I had hinted at it to my mom and a close friend before, but I had never really described how it felt or what it was like. I told him that I loved him and that I still wanted to be with him until death separates us, but that at most times I ""felt like a dude."" He said, ""Yeah, I've kinda known for a while. Since before we were married. And I'm not attracted to dudes, but I'm attracted to YOU and I still love you and want to be married to you. And if you were a dude, I think I'd still be with you."" I couldn't believe it. What an amazing man. I shared with him that when I think about my feelings for him (romantically and sexually) I feel female, and that I never felt like a homosexual man with him. He doesn't harbor a phobia of homosexuality, but he's not sexually attracted to the naked male, and so I think this was reassuring to him. He added that when I'm feeling female it would be nice to see me in a pretty dress and makeup, just occasionally, for him. I'm happy to do that for him. I want him to be happy. I love him. 

That being said, one of the more frustrating things is when I do feel female and apply makeup and the like, but then hours later might feel male and all-of-a-sudden I feel like a boy with makeup on. And it doesn't feel right, it feels downright embarrassing. Or vice-versa. I might dress in my men's clothing and hours later be out of the house feeling female but awkwardly frumpy, in men's clothing and an undone face.

I don't think I want to come out to anyone else yet, mainly because I don't mind the way people perceive me currently. Those close to me know I'm boyish and want to be one of the guys, and I'm included. I don't mind the pronouns. They don't feel right when they contradict the way I'm feeling, but since I'm fluid (even from one minute to the next sometimes), I can't expect people to keep up. If I get called ""sir"" at the grocery store it's kind of like a bonus (when I'm feeling male).

I've just been reading this post back to myself and I want to clarify that I indeed feel male most of the time. I'm not ""confused"" or just a tom-boy or anything. I genuinely feel male. But not always. Sometimes I feel female, sometimes I feel an uneven and varying mixture of both, and sometimes I feel neither. And it's something I've been feeling and thinking about for close to 31 years. And yeah, sometimes I wish I had a penis. But not to use sexually. Just because it's what I feel like I should have. 

As of now I'm very sure that I don't want to transition, mainly because the primary times that I need my reproductive organs (when I'm being sexual with my husband), I feel exclusively female. I guess in a perfect world, I could switch my organs back and forth. Ha! Not likelyin my lifetime. But it would be nice. Given that transitioning would for all intents and purposes be permanent, I don't want to be stuck in the opposite position, wanting to have female organs in the most important time (intimacy with my husband).

That all being said, I have a bit of fear that someday my husband might realize that he wants a ""traditional,"" cisgender wife. From what he says, it sounds like I'm pretty safe, but it's just something that's been weighing on my mind this morning, the first day that I've been ""out"" to him. 

Any thoughts from anyone? I'm sorry if I misused any terms or concepts or anything, I'm pretty new to written concepts (I've been feeling this way my whole life mind you, but have only recently started to explore the research and community that I know I'm a part of).

2017-12-07 11:16:41,7i5r5a,2,10,"okay so this may drag on as I write this but I feel like getting this off my chest and I guess sharing my story.

so I'm amab , just turned 27, and just disclosed to my gf of 5 years of my ""dark secret"". that is ofc, that I sometimes want to be a girl.

for the record these feelings started around puberty, the occasional crossdressing, which was always arousing but yknow, what isn't at that age ^^.

anyway, the reason for my disclosure to her was simply that I hadn't indulged in these feelings since we moved in together, about a year into our relationship, and quite frankly I felt it was negatively affecting our relationship. I was becoming distant, less affectionate and was having spurts of just being angry for no god damn reason. 

I always thought it was a sexual thing until recently to be honest, but then again that was the only way I ever expressed these feelings, which is what lead me to thinking, ""hey me maybe this isn't a kink, dont ya think you should explore this before you regret it?""
the answer was yes, which brings me back to the start: telling my gf.

shes amazing, not even missing a beat she said ""honey, there's my wardrobe go nuts"".
even then I took it slow, wearing a nightgown, indulged in a bit of a gothic look ;). 
but then came yesterday, wore some suuuuuper comfy leggings, with a t-shirt and a little necklace to accessories and I just let loose, my full feminine persona on display.

this surprised my gf, I think she honestly thought it was just about dressing up, but now she saw, she saw this jollyness to how felt, my mannerisms female (at least I felt they were, I was just being me though lol). and then she said it. "" honey, you are acting like a lesbian"" to which I replied without even a thought ""well that's good cause that's what I am"".
it felt soooo validating. my gf is bi and has had a relationship with a girl in the past. so for HER to tell me, to gift me the title of ""lesbian"", felt so good.

of course then came some tears, not from me though, I was feeling so happy and liberated, but from her.
she told me, she doesn't want me to be a woman.
there was some back and forth and essentially what she meant was she didn't want me to ""physically"" change. so no srs or hrt or anything like that.

I'll admit ATM I'm fine with this, after all me and the little guy get on great, and while I would like some breasts while I'm in girl mode, it's only a problem if I focus on it (and there are always breastforms :) )

so here we are the following day, I should say she actually apologized this morning for her outburst, I just hugged her and told her there was nothing to forgive, after all there wasn't.
she had a lot to process in a short amount of time and I love her for reacting so well and embrassing ALL of me.

anyway I hope this wasn't too long, and hope this little story can help others like some of the posts here helped me.

I was becoming distant, less affectionate and was having spurts of just being angry for no god damn reason. \n\nI always thought it was a sexual thing until recently to be honest, but then again that was the only way I ever expressed these feelings, which is what lead me to thinking, ""hey me maybe this isn\'t a kink, dont ya think you should explore this before you regret it?""\nthe answer was yes, which brings me back to the start: telling my gf.\n\nshes amazing, not even missing a beat she said ""honey, there\'s my wardrobe go nuts"".\neven then I took it slow, wearing a nightgown, indulged in a bit of a gothic look ;). \nbut then came yesterday, wore some suuuuuper comfy leggings, with a t-shirt and a little necklace to accessories and I just let loose, my full feminine persona on display.\n\nthis surprised my gf, I think she honestly thought it was just about dressing up, but now she saw, she saw this jollyness to how felt, my mannerisms female (at least I felt they were, I was just being me though lol). and then she said it. "" honey, you are acting like a lesbian"" to which I replied without even a thought ""well that\'s good cause that\'s what I am"".\nit felt soooo validating. my gf is bi and has had a relationship with a girl in the past. so for HER to tell me, to gift me the title of ""lesbian"", felt so good.\n\nof course then came some tears, not from me though, I was feeling so happy and liberated, but from her.\nshe told me, she doesn\'t want me to be a woman.\nthere was some back and forth and essentially what she meant was she didn\'t want me to ""physically"" change. so no srs or hrt or anything like that.\n\nI\'ll admit ATM I\'m fine with this, after all me and the little guy get on great, and while I would like some breasts while I\'m in girl mode, it\'s only a problem if I focus on it (and there are always breastforms :) )\n\nso here we are the following day, I should say she actually apologized this morning for her outburst, I just hugged her and told her there was nothing to forgive, after all there wasn\'t.\nshe had a lot to process in a short amount of time and I love her for reacting so well and embrassing ALL of me.\n\nanyway I hope this wasn\'t too long, and hope this little story can help others like some of the posts here helped me.\n\nkeep on rocking!', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'My first steps...with my gf!', 'created': 1512670601.0}"

2017-12-16 08:03:56,7k5wo0,7,3,"

Ok so hello everyone this might get a little long so sit back and let me tell you my story. I am a 14 year old who was male at birth. I‚Äôm currently in 8th grade- Ever since the summer between 5th and 6th grade I‚Äôve felt traces of gender fluidity. About a year later I had known how I felt about myself-male some days-female others- and sometimes neither. At birth I was given the name Seth but I personally do not think it fits me very well at all. I have recently grown to love the name Vail. I feel Feminin about 50% of the time and masculine about 30% the other twenty percent is a mix of both or neither.

I have not come out to anyone but my best friend so far and that is a big part of the small-ish story I‚Äôm about to tell you....  

About 1 week ago my family woke up and my father decided we would go to church. While my entire family is very religious I personally don‚Äôt share the same views and am an atheist. I was feeling very feminine that day and dreaded putting on the dress cloths my family liked on me. On my way out the door I noticed that my mom was still in her pajamas. I recalled a few other times that she had not come and asked‚ÄùWhy don‚Äôt you ever come to church with us?‚Äù Now, I know I could have worded this better and I knew that as soon as a said it. My mom was not going because she was sick and I had forgotten. She turned around and started to half cry. She told me ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need this now‚Äù and walked away into the kitchen. 

My dad then slapped me(not super hard) on the back of the head and told me ‚Äúwhat were you thinking‚Äù my sister was bringing her friend with her to church that day so I was being watched by my sister as well as her friend. During the car ride I was told ‚Äúdo you even care about people‚Äôs feelings‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat do you have against your mother‚Äù, and ‚Äúis this you now? Are you just going to be insensitive?‚Äù Now, I felt really bad from hurting my moms feelings and the day so far so this made me feel even worse. I felt a level of confusion, guilt, and dread greater then I‚Äôve ever felt before. I had a meetup with my best friend for the first time this year and my dad canceled that. 

After we arrived my dad dropped the girls off so he could park the car and bring me in separate. As we were walking in I stopped for a second to calm my brain. My father then turned around and yelled ‚ÄúIs there something you want to say to me!?‚Äù Humiliated and hurt I replied with a quiet ‚Äúno.‚Äù My dad gave a sharp ‚Äúgood‚Äù then turned around to go into church. My head was so full of emotions and I couldn‚Äôt take them anymore. I bolted in the opposite direction, running down the street as fast as I could. I was in an vastly unfamiliar city far away from the house I had just moved into. As I was running I powered down my phone so I couldn‚Äôt be tracked, I needed to be alone.

4 months earlier I had reached a breaking point in stress and at 12 am I had snuck out of my old house (where we were living at the time) and grabbed a scooter from my garage. I had no phone and no food. I just rode the scooter as far as I could. Eventually I was 5 miles away and I didn‚Äôt know how late it was so I made my way to my friends house. They drove me home where I had to wake up my asleep mom and tell her what had happened.

This was on my mind as I ran.  

I was being chased by my slower dad and I turned a corner and then slid into a nearby alleyway. I hid behind one of the dumpsters there for 45 ministers. I never checked my phone. Soon a worker began working on a nearby building so I left. I walked for about 20 minuets until I got to a local high school. It was Sunday so I didn‚Äôt have to worry about students . I found a bleacher by the baseball field and sat there for a solid hour. At one point I tried to climb the brick wall of the school to jump off the roof.       

Soon I had no idea how long I had been out so I turned my phone on. I immediately got a ‚Äúfind my phone‚Äù alert. I turned off my phone then ran some more. I stopped about half a mile away in a nature park. 

I turned on my phone once more, entered my passcode, and turned on airplane mode before my location could get pinged.

I had 27 texts; from my mom, dad, and sister. My sister said she couldn‚Äôt live without me and that she needed me. My dad told me he was sorry for everything and he just loved me and didn‚Äôt want to loose me. I started to make my way back to the church where I had ran from. Once I got there I called my dad and he told me not to move and that he was on his way.

Once he got there we hugged each other for a solid minute. He told me he was so sorry and will never treat me like that again. I forgave him and told him how sorry I was for running away. I had been gone for 3 hours and my dad called the police to stop looking for me. He asked what we should do next and I decided we should go home. 


Once home I had given my mother a huge hug. She was mad because of how I had made her worry and how much inconvenience it caused. She told me not to run from my problems and to face them head on. 

So that‚Äôs why I am here today asking what to do next. I still have not told my family about my gender identity and don‚Äôt know how. I‚Äôm afraid they will take it as a phase, trying to get attention, or trying to be like other people.  They have had similar responses to other things in the past. 

Me and my dad are ok now and we love each other. The only person who knows my identity is my best friend who happens to be lesbian. 

If you made it this far then thank you so much for listening and being there for me. 

Now that you know my situation can you help me find a way to tell them. I will be seeing a therapist soon and I don‚Äôt know if I should come out of the closet when it‚Äôs just me and him. 
Please help.

Thanks a million -Vail

I am a 14 year old who was male at birth. I‚Äôm currently in 8th grade- Ever since the summer between 5th and 6th grade I‚Äôve felt traces of gender fluidity. About a year later I had known how I felt about myself-male some days-female others- and sometimes neither. At birth I was given the name Seth but I personally do not think it fits me very well at all. I have recently grown to love the name Vail. I feel Feminin about 50% of the time and masculine about 30% the other twenty percent is a mix of both or neither.\n\nI have not come out to anyone but my best friend so far and that is a big part of the small-ish story I‚Äôm about to tell you....  \n\nAbout 1 week ago my family woke up and my father decided we would go to church. While my entire family is very religious I personally don‚Äôt share the same views and am an atheist. I was feeling very feminine that day and dreaded putting on the dress cloths my family liked on me. On my way out the door I noticed that my mom was still in her pajamas. I recalled a few other times that she had not come and asked‚ÄùWhy don‚Äôt you ever come to church with us?‚Äù Now, I know I could have worded this better and I knew that as soon as a said it. My mom was not going because she was sick and I had forgotten. She turned around and started to half cry. She told me ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need this now‚Äù and walked away into the kitchen. \n\nMy dad then slapped me(not super hard) on the back of the head and told me ‚Äúwhat were you thinking‚Äù my sister was bringing her friend with her to church that day so I was being watched by my sister as well as her friend. During the car ride I was told ‚Äúdo you even care about people‚Äôs feelings‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat do you have against your mother‚Äù, and ‚Äúis this you now? Are you just going to be insensitive?‚Äù Now, I felt really bad from hurting my moms feelings and the day so far so this made me feel even worse. I felt a level of confusion, guilt, and dread greater then I‚Äôve ever felt before. I had a meetup with my best friend for the first time this year and my dad canceled that. \n\nAfter we arrived my dad dropped the girls off so he could park the car and bring me in separate. As we were walking in I stopped for a second to calm my brain. My father then turned around and yelled ‚ÄúIs there something you want to say to me!?‚Äù Humiliated and hurt I replied with a quiet ‚Äúno.‚Äù My dad gave a sharp ‚Äúgood‚Äù then turned around to go into church. My head was so full of emotions and I couldn‚Äôt take them anymore. I bolted in the opposite direction, running down the street as fast as I could. I was in an vastly unfamiliar city far away from the house I had just moved into. As I was running I powered down my phone so I couldn‚Äôt be tracked, I needed to be alone.\n\n4 months earlier I had reached a breaking point in stress and at 12 am I had snuck out of my old house (where we were living at the time) and grabbed a scooter from my garage. I had no phone and no food. I just rode the scooter as far as I could. Eventually I was 5 miles away and I didn‚Äôt know how late it was so I made my way to my friends house. They drove me home where I had to wake up my asleep mom and tell her what had happened.\n\nThis was on my mind as I ran.  \n\nI was being chased by my slower dad and I turned a corner and then slid into a nearby alleyway. I hid behind one of the dumpsters there for 45 ministers. I never checked my phone. Soon a worker began working on a nearby building so I left. I walked for about 20 minuets until I got to a local high school. It was Sunday so I didn‚Äôt have to worry about students . I found a bleacher by the baseball field and sat there for a solid hour. At one point I tried to climb the brick wall of the school to jump off the roof.       \n\nSoon I had no idea how long I had been out so I turned my phone on. I immediately got a ‚Äúfind my phone‚Äù alert. I turned off my phone then ran some more. I stopped about half a mile away in a nature park. \n\nI turned on my phone once more, entered my passcode, and turned on airplane mode before my location could get pinged.\n\nI had 27 texts; from my mom, dad, and sister. My sister said she couldn‚Äôt live without me and that she needed me. My dad told me he was sorry for everything and he just loved me and didn‚Äôt want to loose me. I started to make my way back to the church where I had ran from. Once I got there I called my dad and he told me not to move and that he was on his way.\n\nOnce he got there we hugged each other for a solid minute. He told me he was so sorry and will never treat me like that again. I forgave him and told him how sorry I was for running away. I had been gone for 3 hours and my dad called the police to stop looking for me. He asked what we should do next and I decided we should go home. \n\n\nOnce home I had given my mother a huge hug.

This is all very new and kinda confusing to me and im not sure I exactly understand yet if I am 100% male and will flip to 100% female, or if its just a percentage of each that fluctuates. I think its the percentage, because I am both scared of and have no intention of doing hormone stuff or surgery, since it would radically change my life too much, and likely drive my relationship apart.

2017-12-29 23:56:51,7my2z8,4,3,"Hey all, long time lurker, first time poster. 

I've been struggling with my gender exploration for legit years, avoiding the hell out of it, writing it off as my lesbian identity doing things like giving me a wide spectrum of fashion choices and desires, a deep deep desire to be better look more butch (I just wanted to look like a boy), and giving me dysphoria/penis envy so I identified as a stone cold butch sexually. 

So after almost three years of watching me struggle, my nb partner in crime begged me to order a binder. I was really secretive about it, talking only to a masc nb person in my life and my best friend of nine years/old sexual partner who had been with me while I worked out that lack of desire to be touched. (Fun note- my nb partner is more masc than I am and their energy brings out my femme side so they are my first relationship where I've ever enjoyed being topped. Gender is weird.)

As soon as I got it my whole life changed, and I stopped experiencing social anxiety, and I dressed as a man for like, two weeks because of all my joy. But over the last couple of months I've found it shifting back and forth, both high femme and butch expressions being fine on different days, and many days where I don't feel strongly pulled to expressing either side. And days where dysphoria is so bad because of how badly I want a male body my partner is telling me how to make a packer out of condoms while I lie on the kitchen floor a MESS. THIS IS SO SO FUN.

So I'm living with two nb peeps and a transwoman (I love my queer house) and I'm trying to get a real understanding of my gender because the questioning is taking up a lot of space in my brain, but they all have pretty ""stagnant"" genders so they're not quite able to answer my questions. Maybe y'all can help?

One problem I'm having is that I've already divested myself from gender roles, so no action or desire really signifies a binary gender to me. I'm aware they mean nothing. But that makes it really hard to work out a sort of transfer identity. How did you all work this out for yourselves? I'm having a hard time telling myself these feelings are really about gender, because my brain keeps trying to make them about gender expression/fashion/etc. How do we discern the difference between gender identity and gender expression?

And if it really is just desiring to 'look' a certain way rather than BE a certain way, can I justify physical transition stuff like top surgery? How can I justify doing something like taking T if I'm going to wear dresses some days or just not fully express my masculinity a whole bunch of other days? 

I know these are mostly questions only I can answer for me, but guidance from my fellow queers would be really, really appreciated. I feel really lost and disappointed and frustrated with my inability to just stay in one way. It feels like cheating, and my masc or femme identities feel like ""just a phase"" as soon as the coin flips. In trying to be kind to myself, but I think I need some new perspectives.

I was really secretive about it, talking only to a masc nb person in my life and my best friend of nine years/old sexual partner who had been with me while I worked out that lack of desire to be touched. (Fun note- my nb partner is more masc than I am and their energy brings out my femme side so they are my first relationship where I\'ve ever enjoyed being topped.
