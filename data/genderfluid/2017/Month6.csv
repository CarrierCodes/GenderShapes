2017-06-02 19:55:56,6ewqwm,3,4,"I was AMAB, and have been varying degrees of comfortable with this over the course of my life. I'm in my mid-20's now and have a mostly male gender expression, although I have a lot of feminine expressions through my physicality, body language, clothes, jewelry, hair, etc. Enough to constantly get harassed by strangers for presumably being trans or gay (though I am neither). If I don't express myself in these ways, (or am pushed not to by work or the stage (costumes)) then I experience what I think could only be described as non-negligible gender dysphoria. I feel powerfully uncomfortable. 

But more to the point of this post, I know that I felt gender dysphoria MUCH more strongly from the ages of about 13-19. During this time I really felt the need to wear only women's clothing (not clothes as gendered as something like dresses, though I wanted to), I really hated the more masculine things about my body shape, and my body/facial hair was especially unpleasant. But gradually, I've become more comfortable with the masculine features of my body and have embraced them in some ways, as well as embracing slightly more masculine clothes and speech. I don't mind showing off my hairy chest under a slim-fitting v -neck anymore, whereas that used to feel really uncomfortable.
 
So I suppose my question is, are there a lot of others who have experienced something like this on a long-term scale? I've kind of felt weird about feeling less dysphoric than I used to... I sometimes feel like I've betrayed my own identity somehow, or that the pressure of society has succeeded in subconsciously influencing me, which I don't like. I don't really know people who have gone through a similar sort of subtle shift back-and-forth on this long-term scale, so I suppose I'm looking for confirmation that this is normal and that other people experience it.

Basically, once I'm out to my family (I know I probably need to be out to them before any of this can start), I'd like to pursue HRT and top surgery, and I just had a couple of questions for any of you who have medically transitioned in the UK specifically.

1. Has being non-binary or genderfluid impacted your transition in any way? e.g. accessing resources for transition, having to explain non-binary genders to professionals, etc. 

2. My end goal, really, is to be more androgynous than outright masculine; however, I do want to be 'read' as male over female, because I'm super fuckin' tired of being always read as female. In particular, I definitely want a deeper voice and to flatten out some of my curves a bit (I definitely want my chest gone, which is why I'm looking at top surgery later on), but I don't want to be like ... 100% Manly Man. I like the idea of still being somewhat feminine, just not so much so that I'm read as female. Is this actually possible or will I just have to accept being more masculine than I'd like in order to actually feel at home/not constantly anxious in my skin?

3. What has been your overall experience in dealing with health services re: transitioning as a non-binary/genderfluid person? Positive, negative, neither? Doesn't have to be an essay, I just want to know going in whether I'm going to need to brace myself for it to be a struggle.

My name is K.D., and I am a student at Towson University. My thesis is working to examine non-suicidal self-injury in the transgender population. This is a topic that I am extremely close to, as I myself identify as genderqueer and trans-masculine.
In order to write my thesis, I need participants to take my survey. If you identify as transgender, transsexual, gender non-conforming, agender, non-binary and/or have a transgender history and have self-harmed within the last 5 years without suicidal intent, please consider taking my survey!

2017-06-17 01:10:55,6hqnyl,0,5,"So I was making plans to grab lunch with a friend I'm out to, and she had sort of playfully texted saying we should go to Sephora after lunch. I then texted back saying I should go out as my genderqueer self, Mia. She said if I was comfortable doing so I totally should! So for the days before our lunch/shopping day I seriously thought about going, and not going.

I decided I probably wouldn't have another opportunity to do something like this in an environment like a mall so I did. Because I'm not out at home, I wore my clothes under my clothes (never again will I wear jeans under jeans) and did my makeup minimally as I intended to do it in the car.

So we have lunch, it's pretty decent and we drive a couple blocks down to the mall. Once the car stopped and parked I knew it was now or never. I said I was ready so I took off my guy clothes to reveal the clothes underneath and touched up my makeup. This part is the only thing I'm mad about because the stuff I use for my brows melted (I probably shouldn't have left my purse in the car, but I wasn't dressed at the restaurant) and today my wings decided to not cooperate so just went without any :(. Honestly I'm so mad about it still lol. Also my good friend five o clock shadow decided to stop by (I made sure to shave as close as possible and cover it up the best I could). While it wasn't prominent I could see it in the mirror a little bit. I grabbed my wig and made sure it was placed perfectly and we got out of the car. She said I looked good even though I knew I didn't pass as well as I hoped (damn you makeup and hot weather) but it was great she didn't laugh or have any reaction like that. In fact she treated it as if it was nothing and like it was natural, so bless her for that!

We stopped at a couple stores where she tried on some stuff and I tried on one thing but ended up not getting it because I was on a budget lol. In fact I even got ""she'd"" while waiting in line for the dressing room so that was totally awesome! I was still incredibly nervous and shy because I felt like the employees saw through my passing attempt but they treated me like any other customer. Also while walking thorugh the mall I didn't get as many stares or any under the breath remarks as I could tell, which is still totally awesome!

My friend needed to go the restroom. Oh boy the big restroom moment. Before going in I was thinking should I go in with her or wait outside. I ended up waiting outside, mainly since I didn't need to go or check my tuck (which held pretty well throughout the day). This was my first moment alone and I just waited for her as I stared at my phone trying not to make any eye contact. While she was in the dressing rooms I was left alone for a couple minutes a time so I was really nervous then. As soon as she came out I immediately went straight to her lol.

We went to a couple more stores and Sephora. Now I had been makeup shopping before, but just as a guy so it wasn't something too out of left field for me. The lady at the cashier was super nice and welcoming also. My friend said I should get a makeover and get help for anything but decided not to, mainly because I didn't want to buy anything, have her wait for me, and I would end up just taking it off several minutes after on the way home.

As we were walking back to her car we almost ran into two people we knew. She ran into someone she knew on our way in, so I sort of just looked the other way. She totally could tell I wasn't ready for a confrontation with these two people, especially because I'm not out to everyone so she asked if I wanted to chill and we did until he was out of sight.

Driving on the way home she asked how I felt and I said way better than I had thought, and that I would totally do it again! So to my friend, thank you for being just so totally open minded and comforting me, and just treating me like a normal friend. It was a huge confidence booster having you around! Like I couldn't ask for anything more.

Maybe next time my makeup will be more forgiving to me lol.

Also, to anybody out there worried about going out in public for the first time it's not as scary as you think. Sure I was super self conscious and I had a million thoughts going on at once, but really that's just your brain and your comfort zone trying to tell you otherwise (unless you're not in a safe area, that I totally understand is a different situation). Just do it when you're ready and take baby steps if you have to. Go with a friend, it'll be much easier!

So I've been sorting through my emotions about my gender and making changes to help what I now know as dysphoria, starting with pronouns and yesterday asking people to start calling me a new gender neutral name. Both of these were MASSIVE steps for me, but I feel so much more comfortable in my own existence already. 

I've known I wanted to change my name legally for years now (yay for having a last name that is a constant reminder of an abusive family!). But it's always just been about changing my last name. Now with officially going through with the new name in my personal life, changing my first name wouldn't be that much of a stretch.

And so I ask, has anyone done that? Obviously plenty of no gender fluid trans people have, that's kinda talked about plenty.

Okay those are some of my questions. I'm tired of some nonsense I've seen and heard.

I wanted that out there to). I know it ain't anyones job to comfort me here, it's reddit for Peats sake. But I hate the general feel I've been getting ever since I started seriously questioning my identity. These are the biggest stereotypes EVER made by any human, but I feel the need to describe them out loud. 

The hateful ass who perfectly fits what other side feels is the devil. A transphope, hate filled, fearful, unintelligent butt! Who feels anything outside a binary is fake. You can imagine them already I bet. I KNOW I CAN. 

The other side now. A left leaning, hippy, quote air quotes ""open minded"" (not really) person, blindly accepts everything thrown at them person, who badly wants to be on the ""right side of history."" 

These two views have been raging in my brain forever it seems. Neither are clearly right and no one person fits these labels 100%. Hence they're stereotypes. But no matter where I look I can't find a reasonable source. No one wants to be open to questions that might offend them. Either the first stereotype gets offended by someone who feels different to them; and thus argumentatively lashes out and gets called insert-ophobe-here. Or the second person has the same thing happen. Am'I the only person who doesn't find this annoying as heck especially with their dysphoria issues on top of it??? 

I just want a DSM or a professional who clearly isn't blinded by their ideology or religion or whatever. 

Jegus this rant. 

I get some of the basics down. It's been almost a year in this closet. Running low on snacks and soda here. 

Why do people always assume they're the ""expert"" and then don't bother to check their own scripts and facts? Or fall into logical fallacies? Idk if their is a savior you all have in mind but they'd earn a trans respect here (idk if I'm trans... fucking whatever its annoying anyways but thats another rant or whatever. ugh). 

I think both sides have points and deserve respect, concerns need to be addressed. But hey. You've read this far anyways, congrats you all! Maybe my only question to cap of this fire pile is this; what resource do you most trust, and how do they respond to critic?

My barbies all married each other, GI Joe and Ken had some secret thing at one point and at one time or another peeing standing up just seemed more efficient (it's not but what did tiny mewdejour know). Worse things started happening by puberty though and I kept having serious dysphoria. I was stressed that I had breasts when I wanted a nice flat chest, and as weird as it sounds (or maybe not) I wanted to have sex like a man. It just daunted my mind that I didn't have a penis. It sometimes still does (more then sometimes). I feel like I really wish we could just retract or push out certain sexual traits that you wanted or didn't want at the time. 

At any rate fast forward to now. I finally shaved my head and have told my life companion and brother whom lives with us that I am gender fluid. They think it's the best thing ever. My mother who raised me to be a good little white, straight, house wife recently got a therapist who was genderqueer. The therapist was the best one she had ever had and she suddenly understood gender didn't define a person unless you decide to force that agenda on them (or that's their agenda which is fine too). I'm still afraid to tell her but I know when I am ready I will. 

And as a side note I have been tested for hormonal issues and psychological problems. Hormone levels are fine, I could use some vitamin D. Also because of my age when I started having the dysphoria the psych thinks I'm just fine and am genuinely just gender fluid. 

I think I just needed to post this to not feel so alone. It's so weird existing in a gender binary world. I am sick of living as a solitary genderfluid individual. If anyone has advice please send it my way.

Short answer: yes. Yet again you are currently reading yet another post about another individual who has come out as genderfluid. So, hello! Welcome, thank you for reading, and I hope a lovely person such as yourself who is taking the time to read this is having a lovely day/evening/night! My name is... well, not something I will not say as I prefer to private over the internet, but you can call me Marii - or K, Kemi, Onion, and etc. I am a cardbook of nicknames at this point as I love to attach myself to different given nicknames (my newest being Marii actually!). I am somehow twenty-two years of age as of March twenty-first, just as well AFAB. My pronouns at this current time in my life is she/her, as I've grown up with them for my entire life and cannot imagine of parting with them. 

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 

As stated, I am genderfluid. Despite this I am not bothered by these set pronouns because mentally I never assigned much value to them, well that is until my days of being fully male come out and I simply replace those pronouns with he/him - which by the way rarely ever happens for me. Most of the time I linger in a very nonbinary state using neutral pronouns such as them/their (and even we/us when talking to myself funny enough), or within a neutral state somewhere between male and female or in a combination of the two. There are also those beloved rare times for me where I identify solely as a demiboy or demigirl and the last of them all as solely female. My switches usually occur on a monthly basis, sometimes with months of being one thing or by month to month of going in between something else. I've even had a year of being strictly in one gender, so as you can see my experience might be entirely different from your own - or the same, which I would be happy to talk about as I think it would be exciting to discuss. Anyway, now that I'm done covering the basis, let's get into the juicy stuff. 

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 

As a child I knew who and what I was from the start. I, before discovering a broader term that felt true to me, was a being that liked both the girls and the boys and was ""male"" (more demiboy and neutral in that order, but child me knew nothing of these terms of course). In the mind of my childhood self if there were truly only two genders, I was a male. My genitalia was male and, of course by this notion, every other male would have had the same or similar physical features. This was proved wrong, as expected, and I was then explained to through elementary Sex Ed that I was anatomically female with all the parts and inner workings inside and out. I can tell you right now that to a child such as myself this didn't mean much to me. Take out the value of those words and the result on the matter is: I must have a boy-vagina. And so this is the philosophy I chose to live by, that is up until high school where hormones made things traumatically complicated and I was forced into accepting my body for what it was, how it operated, and why certain comments people made would affect me to the degree they did during many years of verbal bullying from elementary to high school. 

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 

It took many years to realize I held different meanings and values for words ""male"" and ""female"" than literally every one else around me and to implement this as best I could. Because of such confusing time, I lost out on many opportunities but gained many different experiences. Even with the small normal experiences and milestones, I was always thankful because I could perceive the world (and quite frankly my own world) differently. Not everything meant the same for me, as I'm sure most of you have felt at one point or another and I always thought that was cool. Despite my depression which would often fluctuate from situational to major (and even psychotic at one point), I always felt impressed by myself for being like this. I could understand two different popularized viewpoints of this world (that being male and female), identify with both in different times in my life that taught me different things, and henceforth reach different outputs that made me interaction with this world so different and unique to me. It was something special that I treasure because I learned from the world differently and developed a broader mindset from the get go, and even got to teach something different and thought provoking to the many therapists I've had the pleasure of meeting that tell me they were happy to learn from and about me as they felt I broadened their own worlds. 

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 

So, as you can probably see, being genderfluid is important to me and I hold it as something significant in my own personal development and growth as a human being - which is why I was even more excited the first time around when I discovered there were names for the things I felt finally and now I've discovered a whole community! You could say I'm as giddy about this as I was back then. I am happy to have found a safe space were there are others being true to themselves, or even just questioning themselves because I personally believe we need to constantly be questioning ourselves, our societal ideology, internal philosophies, teachings, intent, and belief systems to thrive in this current life. Well, at least only about the stuff that matters as we should be careful of promoting toxicity, self-harm/disrespect, self-fulfilling prophesies, false existence, and otherwise negative influences that don't meet internally who we know ourselves to be progressing as. 

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 

On that note, I would like to continue on to document yet another leap made in my progression as a human being on this beautiful Earth. Recently I have come out to my mother as a genderfluid individual, which involved a ten page total essay with written and video evidence to back up this specific gender and several examples of my own experiences being genderfluid along with the trauma suffered from outside influences that only complicated this all because writing is a calling of mine that I would like to think that I thrive best in. Because of this incident of progression I was able to buy my very first packer recently, which I am very excited about using soon enough (or really just holding to be honest, as I think it will have more use as an emotional/mental healing tool that will be more similar to having a stress ball for me personally). Now, I am coming out to all of you reading.

So, hello once again! My name is Marii, and I want to welcome you into a very important part of my life and just as well be welcomed into your own beautiful existences. I have plans to go around reading through this entire subreddit and most likely leave encouraging messages (which my social anxiety is already advising against). I hope we can friends, as I would be happy to befriend even more like-minded individuals and only have one other genderfluid friend that I met only weeks before this. Again, I hope life will be pleasant to you and thank you for reading, and I am terribly sorry to have posted such an overly long post. It is a bad habit of mine that comes out when I can talk myself into posting anything online and there is no word limit on the website I am using...

Well, at least only about the stuff that matters as we should be careful of promoting toxicity, self-harm/disrespect, self-fulfilling prophesies, false existence, and otherwise negative influences that don\'t meet internally who we know ourselves to be progressing as. \n\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ \n\nOn that note, I would like to continue on to document yet another leap made in my progression as a human being on this beautiful Earth. Recently I have come out to my mother as a genderfluid individual, which involved a ten page total essay with written and video evidence to back up this specific gender and several examples of my own experiences being genderfluid along with the trauma suffered from outside influences that only complicated this all because writing is a calling of mine that I would like to think that I thrive best in. Because of this incident of progression I was able to buy my very first packer recently, which I am very excited about using soon enough (or really just holding to be honest, as I think it will have more use as an emotional/mental healing tool that will be more similar to having a stress ball for me personally). Now, I am coming out to all of you reading. \n\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ \n\nSo, hello once again! My name is Marii, and I want to welcome you into a very important part of my life and just as well be welcomed into your own beautiful existences. I have plans to go around reading through this entire subreddit and most likely leave encouraging messages (which my social anxiety is already advising against). I hope we can friends, as I would be happy to befriend even more like-minded individuals and only have one other genderfluid friend that I met only weeks before this. Again, I hope life will be pleasant to you and thank you for reading, and I am terribly sorry to have posted such an overly long post. It is a bad habit of mine that comes out when I can talk myself into posting anything online and there is no word limit on the website I am using... \n', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'So, there\'s another ""coming out"" genderfluid post?', 'created': 1498582423.0}"
