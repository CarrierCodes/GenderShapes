Bigender late 30's AMAB. I went through a long period of just crossdressing and assuming that it was how I identified and what I was, but in recent years have started to feel like the dressing wasn't really reflective of me, as well as feeling a lack of connections with other crossdressers. So I began therapy and was trying to sort out what I really felt about my gender identity and who I am, and have started to really understand better that I identify more as bigender or even gender fluid. I present male the vast majority of the time in my life, and my femme side is still pretty private. As I grow into it though, I'm feeling stress around these two sides of my personality intersecting. I'm always nervous when out in a dress that I'll see someone I know from my work life, where being along the trans spectrum wouldn't necessarily mean losing my job, but could be really difficult.

Preemptive apology for the brain dump.

Alright... 33, AFAB, as a young'un I would wear my brother's briefs and stuff them with socks when I was home alone. Made fake penises with tin foil to pee standing up. Tomboy, Hated 'cute' and dresses (sometimes). Super jilted that my brother got to play sports instead of me. I also was into typical girly things and gravitated towards strong girls in most of all of my reading. I like make-up, but want to wash it off my face 5 minutes after putting it on. I like dresses, but feel beyond uncomfortable in them. I prefer jeans and sweater/oxford shirt combos. I love winter and fall, so I can hide in my clothes.

My wife is transitioning MTF. I never had an issue being the top or bottom during adult time (even before she came out to me). I like the power of being a top, but also like being a bottom.  I think my feelings about my gender started when my wife started socially transitioning. I don't like feeling like a copycat, but maybe her transition just brought all of these feelings and memories to the forefront of my brain? 

I've had chest dysphoria for as long as I could remember, but attributed that to NEVER having the cute little perky breasts that most girls had. It's a source of daily terrible feelings about myself. The past bunch of years has been a constant battle to hide my top half from view, resulting in slouched shoulders, poor posture, and a relentless ache in my mid-back.

I feel like if I were better aware of where I am I'd be less erratic, but I don't know how. Sometimes I'll look in the mirror and see myself as neutral, then I'll part my hair slightly differently and see a girl.

Seriously, my wife started her transition 2 years ago so I should have known better.

The most consistent way I've found to gender myself every day is to try on clothes until something sticks, but that's time consuming and eventually gets muddled from simply looking at too many options. Or I'll find a feminine outfit and think it looks great on my body but when I see my face in it it feels wrong, and I don't know if it's the clothes that don't match my gender or some part of my face or hair.

I wonder if a lot of my trouble is my hairstyle (or lack thereof). I spent most of my life ignoring my hair and just letting it be a huge, shapeless blob because I couldn't be bothered to style it but was scared to cut it. This January, I chopped it all off into a very short pixie, and while I'm happier with it and would be willing to style it I have no idea how.

2017-09-20 02:27:49,7183d2,10,5,"Hello Ya'll,

**Background**

So I am Amab, who has been a closet crossdresser for a few years now. I've been slowly putting more mental and time investment into dressing in the last 4 months because of stresses and other factors.

I've always been very content gendering myself as a man. It just ""felt right"" when considering my gender. I consider my gender expression more fluid. But I am male-leaning (that and the fact that when dressing my goal has rarely been to pass. I don't tuck or do a huge amount to hide my ""maleness"" aside from shaving).

**The experience**

Yesterday, I felt my first major pang of dysphoria during an outing dressed. I had just bought my first wig (yay for Halloween stores), and was adjusting it in a public restroom when it hit me. ""*OMG, who is that girl in the mirror? Wait... that's me! What the heck, what the heck, what the... I love it!*"" I felt the shiver, and for the next few hours while I had the wig on I just stared at myself in love/disbelief. It just felt... happy.

Now granted, I know I'm not a perfect pass, but this was the first time I had **ever** felt any type of serious dysphoria. And it was purely a positive dysphoria. Not a ""I dislike my male body"", but more like ""I love this fem body"".

**The problem**

So now what? I'm having trouble digesting this experience and moving forward. Transition of any kind has never really been on the table because I never felt trans; I still don't feel trans. I still feel male, I still feel alright as a male. I'm just not sure how to handle this experience.

How do ya'll handle these pangs of dysphoria? Was this dysphoria? Any experiences or advice in this arena? 

Thank you!

Yet I'm still interested in phalloplasty. My lower dysphoria is excruciating and I *need* phallo for my mental health. 

I have a phenomenal therapist who is earning her PhD in transgender health. She treats all of the trans students on campus. But I'm still nervous about the idea of talking to her about this. 

I struggled for years with internalized transphobia and I think I'm experiencing the same thing in coming to terms with my gender fluidity. 

Because I love my breasts but also want a penis, I'm worried that my therapist may get the impression that this is just some weird kinky thing, although I've been seeing her long enough to know that she's educated on nonbinary identities and would likely take this seriously. 

I feel like a freak even though I know I'm not. I've socially transitioned and then detransitioned once before already from lack of resources and support systems. I've been out as a binary trans man for nearly two years and I'm so afraid of how others would react to this. I've been enjoying expressing femininity and masculinity in tandem.

Was chilling on my university bus, waiting to go home. \n\nThen this guy sits next to me. He immediately strikes up a conversation and asks if I smoke (heavily implied- weed). I had a moment of like ""There are so many people around, are we really gonna talk about this?"" Thought, fuck it, and told him yeah. He laughs and we start talking. I don\'t have good pitch control, but he still called me ""dude"" and stuff. Then he invited me to a party he was throwing that weekend, gave me a piece of paper with his info. We shook hands before he had to get off the bus.\n\nI passed because he thought I was a little druggie boy LOL\n\nThat shirt is now my absolute favorite guymode shirt.

Remember you are not alone. There are tons of trans/genderfluid/nonbinary people out there! You are not alone! 


You are not sick or ill or delusional for your gender. There is nothing wrong with being genderfluid. 


You are not a special snowflake. You are who you are. 


And things will get better. They're slowly improving in some ways.... There are more books with genderfluid characters, for example. Some places are bringing a third gender option forward for people like us. Keep hoping. Never give up.

I guess from doing that all the time, it started to encompass how I felt in day to day life, with me feeling more feminine and growing more comfortable in doing so.
