His question is about pronouns: specifically, how do you politely correct someone if they use the incorrect pronoun? He is 14 and looks, well, like a typical 14 year old boy, so is concerned how to explain to others that sometimes he is actually a she at that time. 

He has told his close friend group, myself and his stepdad and sibling and step siblings here about being gender fluid, but is yet to tell his Dad, step mum and step siblings at that house, which he only spends every second weekend at anyhow.

We went shopping and bought him a new, more androgynous wardrobe on the weekend, and he's really happy with it. All love, respect and support coming from us, we just don't have the answers to all the questions he has at the moment!

He's seeing a youth counselor who he really likes, and starting next week will be part of a youth LGBQTI and gender fluid/queer group as well. Peer support is important, I feel.

Honestly I really felt like I was treated like a girlfriend, even though I just sat there and soaked it in, not really able to add anything.

So we got lunch, and headed to Ulta, a makeup store. I got gendered correctly the entire time by the employees which was super awesome.

2017-07-14 15:00:05,6n9k4s,1,2,"Hey. Thanks for taking the time to read this. It's probably lame and/or pointless but here's the deal...

I'm 24 years old, AMAB. Even as a kid, I often thought about being a girl. It really appealed to me. I never tried makeup or dressing in feminine clothes, but it's something I never stopped thinking about, even to now. For a while, I thought I might be trans. And I definitely do wish I had been born female. But no, there are definitely times I'm comfortable being a man, and with feeling masculine.

Even so, I'm not at all happy with my body. At times like the one I'm going through now, the dysphoria is unbearable. I catch sight of myself in the mirror, and I recoil in almost tangibly painful disgust. 

I want to be more feminine in general. And I'm not exactly a sterling example of a manly man. I'm a small, soft-spoken nerdy dude. But I was born with a barrel chest and corresponding broad shoulders, with a large, high forehead and terrible, thin hair. I went yesterday to get a haircut that was supposed to be androgynous, and feel like I walked away only looking more masculine. I shave close, often to the point of nicking myself several times, yet the shadow of stubble never seems to go away, even if it feels smooth to the touch.

So... I don't know. What can I do? I have no experience with trying to present as feminine, and so far anything I do just doesn't work. I don't know where to start. I don't even know if it's possible, with how shitty my body is. I'm considering HRT, not to fully transition, but to feminize my body at least. But even that can't fix everything. 

I know this is rambly and likely hard to follow or sympathize with. I'm typing this in the middle of an anxiety attack and I can't even breathe right now.

Hello everyone :) I've been lurking Reddit for the past couple of years, but was never really motivated to make an account for any casual topics. However, the past few years (this one especially) has been quite eye-opening in terms of my identity, and after checking out several LGBT+ subs, I decided to make an account so I could ask for help from people in similar situations. Also, please excuse me if my terminology is incorrect/offensive, I don't really know all the lingo in regards to this sub, but I'm trying my best and will make sure to be as sensitive as possible. 

I identify as a girl for the most part, and I was very girly in the beginning of my life. I loved dresses, had long hair, was friends with all girls, etc. However, I had an older brother whom I'm close to, and as I got older I started to become more tomboyish, made more friends with boys (because of my brother, I found it easier, and I slowly found it harder and harder to relate to /become friends with girls, as they excluded me). I soon stopped wearing skirts, and kept my hair short, (chin-length), much to the chagrin of my mother, who would comments on how my clothing and haircut made me look like a boy. I had/have quite a deep voice for a girl, and this, combined with my increasingly-masculine dress sense and my all-boy friend group, was what kickstarted my getting bullied in middle school. I was called a man, a lesbian, transgender. I denied it, but in retrospect these taunts weren't too far off - I've identified (privately) as bi for the past year/half year now, but haven't told my family. Not out of fear (they are generally very supportive), I just don't know how to broach the subject. However, I've also come to realize that I may be gender fluid. Around 5th grade I started putting my hair in a baseball cap and wearing sunglasses to see if I would make a convincing man. I have pretty strong features, so it surprisingly worked. When I styled myself that way, I would wear a gaint oversized hoodie and baggy shorts, and my family would find it funny cause I looked convincing. However, I slowly found myself really liking myself in that form, and wanting to stay that way for extended periods of time. At first I just brushed it aside as an alter ego. I'm a theatre kid, and  when me made up our own characters to play I was almost always a man, and I was frequently cast in masculine roles. I am quite shy, so theatre was always my catharsis, a way to be more confident. I started to pair this look with a tough, ganster-ish persona, so I thought it was just my way of coping with feelings of emotional weakness. However, once I gave the persona a name, I started to feel like him completely, and would want to be referred to with male pronounce.  However this would only be for about a day, and it would disappear for a long time. The majority of my confusion stems from not really feeling any dysphoria, at least I don't think.  I do frequently feel shame about my body, but I feel like it stems from a different place. I hit puberty very early, and started growing hips and breasts much faster than my classmates, which made me feel extremely insecure, and I've wished a lot of times that it had come later, or even that I could reverse it, because I feel like I lost my childhood/innocence with that (which is pretty silly objectively, but society will tell you what it wants to). I'm also quite curvy compaired to other girls in my school, and a lot of times I've looked in the mirror and wished I didn't have hips, because I feel like it 'ruined' my body from its pre-pubescent purity. Now I'm not really sure why I feel that way.  But other times I've embraced my figure as a sign of womanhood, I have many stereotypically feminine interest, connect with other girls. But other times it feels like the opposite, I feel disconnected from girls, I indulge in my stereotypically masculine hobbies, want to be/be referred to as a boy, and to be a boy. I can't describe it accurately without wasting your time, but all in all it just feels like such a flux, even though its quite infrequent. The majority of the time I really like being a girl (aside from sexism :P ), even love it sometimes, I have recently started to consider myself a feminist, etc. And while these days of feeling like a boy are quite rare, in the moment it feels so strong, and it sometimes just breaks my heart thinking that I'll never be able to 'fully' be a boy, or be accepted as one only some of the time. I don't want to transition (aside from the occasional thought of hating my body), but sometimes I wish I could have a male physique just on the days I want to. All in all, I'm just really confused. I can no longer deny the possibility of me being gender fluid, but sometimes it scares me, because society barely accepts trans people who are binary (if that makes sense, please correct me if I'm wrong), so I don't know if anyone I know would understand how I feel.

I'm Jeremy, I run a Discord server for trans/gender non-conforming individuals. You might be thinking ""Well, there are a lot of trans servers. What makes this one different?"". I think our trans server stands out because we're all very welcoming and eager to add new friends into the fold. We accept anyone regardless of gender identity, progress in transition, or presentation.

We have a lot of channels set up to discuss various topics! Many of us are avid gamers and our server even has it's own Minecraft (Peaceful/Vanilla) server to play on.

On top of the channels to discuss everyday topics or niche interests, we also have support channels. Many of our members are willing to open their ears to you or possibly even assist you with an issue you may have. Of course, we also have rooms for your specific gender identity (transfemme, transmasc, non-binary).

We currently have more younger members than older ones and we'd love some older trans people. &lt;3

If you don't know what Discord is, check out https://discordapp.com/ . Discord is a voice and text chat program a bit like skype typically geared towards gamers but that's definitely not it's only use. People have servers set up from topics varying from trans servers to servers for TV shows.

2017-07-30 00:27:00,6qehie,2,6,"Hi. So I don't really know what I hope to get out of posting this. Maybe I just need somewhere to talk to people who understand. 

So I have recently (and a lot in the past) questioned my gender. In the past, I've felt comfortable in my body, but lately I've been very uncomfortable. I hate my boobs, and my feminine features. But I don't hate those things all the time. Sometimes I play up my boobs and wear makeup (like to accentuate my female features). 

More recently, I've been considering about getting breast reduction. Ive considered it in the past, but I'm now researching insurance coverage and how much it will cost, recovery and everything else.

Im currently dating a trans girl, who is very supportive. But I'm afraid of saying ""hey! Im genderfluid"" even though we've talked about this and she has fully said she doesn't care if I am, that she will support me 100% no matter what I choose to do. (Breast reduction, srs) 

Im not sure exactly what I want other than smaller boobs, so they're easier to hide. What kind of exercises can I do to lose weight, and lose boob size?

Any other thoughts of how to talk to my girlfriend, or anything else is welcomed!",genderfluid,Questioning?,1501399620.0,"{'created_utc': 1501374420, 'id': '6qehie', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 6, 'selftext': 'Hi.

2017-07-31 02:33:55,6qlmck,4,6,"Hey all, I've been keeping my hair long, below my shoulderblades, for years now because for me and my hair it's been the easiest way to maintain it. I've been considering cutting my hair short for a while now, however, probably when I get done with college and move out. I've noticed a lot of folks on here who have some really good androgynous hairstyles, but most of them seem to have more curl in their hair than I do. And by this I mean their hair probably actually curls. Mine is so stubbornly straight that the one time there was an attempt at curling it, three hours, four methods and two bottles of hairspray were wasted and the only result was that my hair got a little wavy in the last three inches of it or so.
