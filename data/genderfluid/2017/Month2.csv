What I am, however, considering is a vacation a few hours from where I live, in another state, come warmer weather. Basically, spend at least a couple days living as ""woman me."" Wake up? Go out to eat? Go shopping? Go to the beach? All of this as woman me.

I've started using a pill reminder app on my phone since last I used the pill since I've started taking medication for bipolar and adhd so the pill could possibly do better than it used to but I'd honestly prefer a more long term and/or permanent solution as I don't want to get pregnant ever (I'm already a mess enough while on my period, I hate to know how I'd be if like that constantly for 9 months or more and I also don't want children). I'm in a relationship with a woman and I'm likely to marry her but if we ever brought in a third partner who was male or if,  heaven forbid, other worse possible things happened that might cause pregnancy, I don't want any risk at all. I'd also prefer to just not have a period at all because they're really rough on me, but if I have to, I'll figure it out. 

I just now finally found a psychologist that's affordable for me that may write me a letter for HRT. However, I literally just started seeing them and I may not get that letter for a while. If I had a more permanent solution, would I end up having to reverse it entirely once starting HRT and therefore waste the money I may spend on it? Or are there solutions that would work well with HRT that I could get now and have no hiccups with? Or should I just get the pill in the meantime, deal with the periods and such, and just be ready to cancel that prescription once possibly starting HRT?

While I do bounce back and forth between genders, I do wanna state I tend to lean more to the male side. I'm not sure if that will help/hinder but I thought I'd make sure to say it. I'm hoping I can get HRT in a way that leads to a more androgynous appearance to lessen the dysphoria  (I'm excessively curvy right now so I'm also worried about birth control that might add weight on as it's hard for me to lose weight, hard to build muscle, and also seems like most of my weight I gain goes towards my curves which only worsens the dysphoria too).

2017-02-03 07:30:37,5rslg7,1,4,"Okay, as mentioned in [another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/5rhd61/exploring_taking_a_vacation_as_my_potential/) I am toying with the idea of a ""girl vacation"" where I spend as close to 0% of the time as possible as a guy. I also am wanting this, if possible, to be at least two full days (and three nights, counting the travel day down as one night, and travel day back up as not a night, if that makes sense).

Now, considering I live about halfway between Atlanta and the Georgia-Alabama line in the SE US, you can see where I am near. I want this trip to be somewhere with a beach. The closest three options I can see as ""getting there in a day without feeling like I have to travel the whole thing in one go"" are Charleston, SC, Tybee Island, GA, and Panama City Beach, FL.

Now, you might be wondering why I picked those three, they have beaches. I am not opposed to vacation spots without beaches that may be in similar (or even less) distance, like a Chattanooga, TN. Basically, anywhere less than about 4 hours from the metro Atlanta area, give or take a half-hour of travel difference. The big attraction beaches have to me, however, is that this trip is being formulated for a time in late spring/early summer.

The main reason I am so heavily focused on the beach spots, I already have a bikini that I think I look pretty good in, and would like to actually get some use out of it this year.

Now, a cheap hotel or airbnb spot with a pool would work as well, and if the trip to that spot was, say, an hour and a half to two hours away, instead of three and a half to four and a half hours, I'd probably like the idea a LOT better, it's just that I somehow imagine a major tourist spot like a beach being a bit more LGBT friendly, even in the south.

2017-02-06 21:08:04,5sgxpo,1,8,"Hey y'all!

I've been going through a round of self-rediscovery and during that process I discovered I was genderfluid/genderqueer. I know they're umbrella terms but the part of the definitions that fit me are where it says ""a person feels they have both male and female genders inside"". This is exactly how I feel. I've been looking at some videos on Youtube and I've learned a lot. For instance,  I wake up in the morning and based on how I feel (boy mode or girl mode) that's how I dress for the day. My sex is male and I am very comfortable being male and I do not wish to transgress to a female sex. When I'm in girl mode, I like to express it through the way I dress.

What makes me feel this way/How did I discover this? Well, I've known I was gay ever since I was six. I didn't know what it was at the time, all I knew was that I liked boys a lot better than girls. This was also back in the late 70's to early 80's back when the ""internet"" was still a private network and the accessibility to information wasn't as easy as it is now. My gayness was something I put in a jar and put on a shelf for later reinspection. Years passed by and I grew up and came out of the closet. I didn't rediscover the genderqueer jar until about eight months ago while going through a round of talk-therapy. I needed to clean out the closet so to speak, confront and resolve some things from my past and file them away so I can continue moving forward with my life. While doing this I found this jar, blew the dust off of it and opened it up and looked inside.

I remember some things from my childhood that the typical boy wouldn't do. One of the funnier moments I remember was I was about 4 years old and I was at Kmart with my Mom. I'd always go look at the toys while she shopped and she would come get me before she checked out. She came and got me one day and I had a tea set in my hand. She didn't want to get it for me until I threw a hissyfit in the store for it. She put it in the cart and off to the register we went. I wasn't allowed to play with it while my dad was at home (for obvious reason, growing up in the rural south has its perks sometimes), but I had the best of times having my tea parties with my imaginary friends. Something else I remember, I grew up in the 80's. The 80's were great! Everyone was all coked to the gills and money was flowing around like water. The fashions and hairstyles were oh so rad! I remember having an aunt and a female cousin who ""partook"" in the 80's life. They never did any drugs that I knew of but I remember loving their outfits when I was a kid and wanting something similar for myself. I was so thrilled the first time I got a pair of parachute pants!

Moving along like the hands of time always do, I'm starting to explore this new side of my personality and I have to tell you this is the happiest I've ever been in my life. I've only got a handfull of skirts and tights because I'm just getting started in this but I cannot wait until my wardrobe gets bigger. It's kind of an irony in my life because I like to live a very minimalist lifestyle but my wardrobe is exploding! I'm designing a new tinyhouse and I can't believe that I'm actually adding a closet so I can hang dresses and skirts in. I have an nimgur account that I've got a few pictures if you'd like to take a looksee at [bennetfox.imgur.com](http://bennetfox.imgur.com). I'm going to add more pictures as time progresses because I'd like to see how this evolves over time.

There are a couple things that I've learned that I don;t like. You see, my style is ""athleisure"". I like to wear sports apparel casually and one of my favorite outfits is a pleated cheer skirt and an Adidas hoody. I'm not into the hair or makeup but I do enjoy painting my fingernails. Right now they are hot tamale orange and I really like the color. I can't do hair or makeup because I an an albino and I am functionally blind. I can't see myself cleary enough in the mirror to put on makup and do my hair every day although I would love to grow my hair long enough so I can do a small ponytail or pigtails. I don't think I can get into wigs either. The problem with wigs and makeup is it's like the person is trying to disguise something. Please don't take offense to that because I don't mean it that way. I don't really like makeup on women either for generally the same reasons. I understand people do it to make themselves feel good and that's great, that's just not me. I prefer short hair because I really enjoy dying it fun bright colors. I've got the white base to start with and it takes color so well!

The other thing I don't like is being called a ""crossdresser"". I know I said I'm comfortable with my male sex, but I am not a crossdresser. Unfortunately that word has some very negative connotations that I do not want to discuss here.

So anyways, I have some questions that I'd like to ask you. 

* How did you discover that you were genderqueer/genderfluid?
* How did everyone around you react to it? did you get responses from people you didn't expect and did you not get responses from people you expected to respond?
* Got any pictures of boy mode/girl mode?
* Is your family in on the loop? Are they supportive or did they drop you like a bad habit?
* And finally, the restroom. Which one do you use? Have you gotten any strange or weird looks/comments while in there?

I really thank y'all for reading this. It's a long process and I'm taking it really slow and figuring out things along the way and I love having the group help and support that I get from reading the LGBTQ reddits. Hugs to everyone and y'all have a great day!

Take care!
",genderfluid,Genderfluid/Genderqueer males: How did you discover that you were genderfluid/genderqueer? An some other stuff.,1486440484.0,"{'created_utc': 1486415284, 'id': '5sgxpo', 'num_comments': 1, 'score': 8, 'selftext': 'Hey y\'all!\n\nI\'ve been going through a round of self-rediscovery and during that process I discovered I was genderfluid/genderqueer. I know they\'re umbrella terms but the part of the definitions that fit me are where it says ""a person feels they have both male and female genders inside"". This is exactly how I feel. I\'ve been looking at some videos on Youtube and I\'ve learned a lot. For instance,  I wake up in the morning and based on how I feel (boy mode or girl mode) that\'s how I dress for the day. My sex is male and I am very comfortable being male and I do not wish to transgress to a female sex. When I\'m in girl mode, I like to express it through the way I dress.\n\nWhat makes me feel this way/How did I discover this? Well, I\'ve known I was gay ever since I was six. I didn\'t know what it was at the time, all I knew was that I liked boys a lot better than girls. This was also back in the late 70\'s to early 80\'s back when the ""internet"" was still a private network and the accessibility to information wasn\'t as easy as it is now. My gayness was something I put in a jar and put on a shelf for later reinspection. Years passed by and I grew up and came out of the closet. I didn\'t rediscover the genderqueer jar until about eight months ago while going through a round of talk-therapy. I needed to clean out the closet so to speak, confront and resolve some things from my past and file them away so I can continue moving forward with my life. While doing this I found this jar, blew the dust off of it and opened it up and looked inside.\n\nI remember some things from my childhood that the typical boy wouldn\'t do. One of the funnier moments I remember was I was about 4 years old and I was at Kmart with my Mom. I\'d always go look at the toys while she shopped and she would come get me before she checked out. She came and got me one day and I had a tea set in my hand. She didn\'t want to get it for me until I threw a hissyfit in the store for it. She put it in the cart and off to the register we went. I wasn\'t allowed to play with it while my dad was at home (for obvious reason, growing up in the rural south has its perks sometimes), but I had the best of times having my tea parties with my imaginary friends. Something else I remember, I grew up in the 80\'s. The 80\'s were great! Everyone was all coked to the gills and money was flowing around like water. The fashions and hairstyles were oh so rad! I remember having an aunt and a female cousin who ""partook"" in the 80\'s life. They never did any drugs that I knew of but I remember loving their outfits when I was a kid and wanting something similar for myself. I was so thrilled the first time I got a pair of parachute pants!\n\nMoving along like the hands of time always do, I\'m starting to explore this new side of my personality and I have to tell you this is the happiest I\'ve ever been in my life. I\'ve only got a handfull of skirts and tights because I\'m just getting started in this but I cannot wait until my wardrobe gets bigger. It\'s kind of an irony in my life because I like to live a very minimalist lifestyle but my wardrobe is exploding! I\'m designing a new tinyhouse and I can\'t believe that I\'m actually adding a closet so I can hang dresses and skirts in. I have an nimgur account that I\'ve got a few pictures if you\'d like to take a looksee at [bennetfox.imgur.com](http://bennetfox.imgur.com). I\'m going to add more pictures as time progresses because I\'d like to see how this evolves over time.\n\nThere are a couple things that I\'ve learned that I don;t like. You see, my style is ""athleisure"". I like to wear sports apparel casually and one of my favorite outfits is a pleated cheer skirt and an Adidas hoody. I\'m not into the hair or makeup but I do enjoy painting my fingernails. Right now they are hot tamale orange and I really like the color. I can\'t do hair or makeup because I an an albino and I am functionally blind. I can\'t see myself cleary enough in the mirror to put on makup and do my hair every day although I would love to grow my hair long enough so I can do a small ponytail or pigtails.

2017-02-06 23:39:12,5shufk,4,2,"Very recently I began to question myself a bit, as I've felt like the girl in me is getting stronger by the day, I still feel like a guy too but I am wondering if I may be Genderfluid, the friends I talked to about this seem to think so but I want some other opinions on this.

It feels like my whole life I've been keeping my sort of ""Inner Girl"" locked away just out of fear of being judged, but at the same time I still feel like a heterosexual(straight) man(still interested in females), and to be honest, this feeling shifts around a bit, on some days I feel like a guy, on some I feel like a girl, and on some days, I feel like both, on the girl days I'd just hide it, and try to act normal, but recently I let my mom know about it and she's pretty chill about it.(She's alot like a therapist to me, she understands me the most and always wants to help whenever something is bothering me in life), she even told me I should embrace the girl side, the first thing I thought about doing to embrace it is letting my hair grow and also dying it pink and my mom thinks the idea of dying it pink would be pretty cool too.

Would I be considered Genderfluid? From the people who I talked to before about it they think I am Genderfluid so I thought a few more opinions on the matter would help.

I also plan on taking it a little slow at first with the ""Letting the inner girl out"" part, starting with just wearing the same clothes I always wear but having long pink hair,  then getting one of those ""real men wear pink"" shirts to help let my inner girl out but at the same time raise breast cancer awareness ,then even later on maybe getting some more girly clothes just to wear around my apartment.

2017-02-08 03:52:45,5sqfgh,7,6,"Okay so first off I believe I'm genderfluid. Second off I realize sex and gender are different things. With that said, I have had a thought.

So gender is something we've all felt. We use terms like gender identity, gender expression, gender attraction, etc. All related issues people ask about here on this subreddit. 

So we feel our genders. Straight, trans, Bi, Pan, and everything else I've heard from there being only two to infinity. But we don't feel it constantly, right? Its a part of our identity but its not there constantly. Since gender has been said to be a social construct. I feel that means its made from social, behavioral, expressive, biological (not sex or chromosomes or genitals solely) , and psychological influences. But we don't have all parts of our identity at the for front at anyone time. 

Say someone is homosexual (attracted to the same sex), they don't necessarily feel or sense that part of their identity while waiting in line at the dmv. They're probably just sick of waiting. But thats still a part of them. So since in this example we see how parts of someones identity can take a back seat can't we see how this might ably to gender?

Someone is genderfluid. They live lives and are busy people, so in-between times where gender takes the for front it can change. Why? No clue, if theres a study I don't know about links please. As far as I'm aware no one has given a reason why.

2017-02-11 16:44:22,5tfy05,6,2,"I guess what I mean is a variation of the common question, ""Am'I BLANK gender?""

It seems like some gender identities are very similar to on another. Like how it appears, to me at least, being genderfluid or polygendered are very similar experiences. Even Bigender seems remarkably similar to being genderfluid. 

In my first example (Genderfluid and Polygendered), how is someone to know if they are a genderfluid person whose identity varies time to time versus being polygendered experiencing multiple identities often going between them? They look to be very similar like one is just describing the state of the other. Am'I missing some small difference here? 

Or Bigender and Genderfluid don't they seem very close to one another, I'm sure I'm missing something here right?

How is a person to know they even have an alternative gender identity even to what most people have? What if someone (or I) am experiencing a need to be more feminine as it is commonly thought about? 

Like its not gender but desire to less of the stereotype they were born with, such as a feminine guy can exist and still be cisgendered.

When I was little it was how I found my sexuality, it always seemed to be an integral part of my life whenever I liked it or not.

I always felt ashamed for liking it, liking to wear the pretty clothes that made me feel so cute and alive. I had a really good friend that I told about it and she accepted me, but I always struggled with the fact that there was that side of me, that side that loved girl's clothes so much.

So it ebbed and flowed throughout my life, there were times I dressed a lot and times I didn't feel the need too. I still liked it, but the fact that I didn't have easy access to the clothes I loved so much killed me because I knew I couldn't look at them the same way girls did or I'd be called a pervert, so I got sad and decided that if I wasn't able to do it the way I wanted that I would be better off not doing it.

I remember when I was around 9 or 10, I was fascinated with the idea of being female, but I never told anyone due to fear of rejection.


Sorry if that was more background than was needed. Anyway, that feeling left, and I was pretty set in my ways of being male, as I thought sex and gender were two sides of the same card. But recently, I've thought that one could be female in terms of sex, and male in gender, or vice versa. Moreover, I've noticed that I tend to ebb between times when I feel more feminine than masculine and more masculine than feminine (and some times when I just don't really care), though when I'm feeling more masculine, I tend to try and dismiss the thought of that and try and excuse it in some way (is that normal?). It's not like I'm against nonbinary people, I have complete respect, but for some reason my masculine mind struggles to see itself as being female occasionally.
The issue I'm having is that I'm afraid that I'm subconsciously doing this for attention or to be edgy in some way (I'm really not sure how, because I'd be ridiculously reluctant to come out), and also because it varies. When I feel more feminine, I feel like ""you know what, maybe I am genderfluid, who knows, maybe I should find out someday"", and when I feel more masculine I feel like I must be cis and me thinking I'm genderfluid just isn't correct. So my main issue is that I'm not sure whether I'm just a fairly feminine man (as my masculine mind would like to think) or genderfluid.
I did question myself with my good friend a few months ago in 2016, but I just reached the conclusion that I'm just a feminine male, but I've started questioning myself again.
I have a genderfluid friend who I could talk to, but I'm afraid they'd talk to other people about it.

I wouldn't get mad if someone called me he or she, but I'd prefer not to be called they, if that is of any value to anything. Also, I tend to be attracted exclusively to females (in terms of physical sex), whether I feel feminine or masculine, if that means anything (sorry if you didn't need to know that)

Thanks for reading, and please let me know what you think :)

Sometimes--indeed, often--I have thoughts along these lines: What clothes would I want to wear if I was a girl? What would my sexuality and sexual preferences be if I was a girl? What surgeries would I want to get if I was a girl? What hairstyle would I want to have if I was a girl? What kinds/styles of makeup would I want to use if I was a girl? Et cetera.

However, in additional to all of these feelings, I also feel very comfortable being a guy; indeed, while I dislike some--indeed, perhaps many--aspects of my body and face (basically, I'd like to andrognize my body and face) as well as male social roles (for instance, I would face the risk of getting beaten up if I will wear a dress or a skirt), I also enjoy living as a guy and all of that--as well as enjoy using male pronouns.

Anyway, could I be gender-fluid? Specifically, are all of these feelings of mine an embodiment of gender-fluidity on my own part?

So I've known I wasn't cisgender since I was 11, and identified with the label of genderfluid since I was 14. I finally found a name I was comfortable with when I was nineteen (shout out to my friend for coming up with it) and I am now twenty. Tomorrow, I go in to get my name changed legally. And holy shit, I am so fucking scared. 

I'm scared that they'll say no. I'm scared I'll get laughed out of the courtroom. I'm scared my parents are going to feel like they're losing their baby girl instead of gaining an adult child who is so much better than they were before. I'm scared. Just really scared. And I need kind words, please. I started disassociating about 10 minutes ago because I'm so nervous about all of this and I need words of encouragement. Have any of you changed your name? How long ago? How did it go? How do people take it? 

Thank you all, and I hope you all had a great weekend.
