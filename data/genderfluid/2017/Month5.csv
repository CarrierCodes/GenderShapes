I feel that I am a buch lesbian and I may be a man who is a lesbian if that is possible or a buch lesbian I kinda wish I had a woman's body I am overall satisfied with my male body. 

Gender being as artificial as race is troubling.

However I really feel more like I'm tran aged my us passport says i am 20 I have identified as being 2-4  years older since I was 11 I think more like two or three would have been better my whole life if I would just two years old and I think everything will be better i'm not sure. And maybe this is just me trying to compensate. If I had the age and independence I feel I need maybe being of a more taken care of gender would be less appealing. If I had Independence and age I feel I need would I have gender confusstion.
