When I was younger I used to let my sister paint my nails under the guise of being a nice big brother. Really I just liked nail polish.

I’ve always been overweight which really effects my confidence. 

While I generally like male clothing, I wear long shorts and work shirts daily, I’ve always wanted to be pretty at times.

I went to Walmart to look for some skirts but had a bit of a panic attack. So Friday i went to Goodwill with my very supportive wife. I got a full outfit. My wife did my hair and makeup and I dressed full fem for the first time. I almost cried. My wife told me if someone who didn’t know me were to see me they’d never suspect I was a bio-male.

I’ve still got a lot of work to do. I’m still overweight but dieting and starting an exercise routine.   I also need to learn to do my own makeup and hair better, I had my first attempt today and it went okay.

2017-10-14 16:23:46,76d2rd,6,9,"Hi., 
I'm Aspie, and fit somewhere on the transgender / non-binary / gender fluid spectrum. I'm posting into this community, as I feel this group will be more comfortable with the idea of presenting in more than one way... 

And so, here is where it gets interesting...

I've read gender fluidity as being described as: ""I change over time, sometimes i feel more A, other times more B, other times more C, ... "". In this case, the gender fluid person may choose to change the way they present, to express how they feel.. This is really cool :)   

I would describe this as a person that has multiple modes, and their body switches between modes, and then they choose to present to the public in that mode. 

In my situation i was ""more or less"" presenting in one mode. A non-binary mode where i would combine masculine clothes that fit my body with some sort of skirt/kilt that to my mind expressed a broader feminine component that is an intrinsic part of me.  This was evolving over time, as I was pushing more and more into the feminine space because i felt safer and more validated in that space.

The trouble is, I now live in a country where it is physically unsafe to be LGBT+ [ see Main findings on page 74 of http://women.ge/data/docs/publications/WISG_situation-of-lgbt-persons-in-Georgia_ENG-www.pdf ] I have experienced this myself... Shaving my arms/legs and wearing a bright coloured shirt was enough to be threatened by a group of men. 

So in this case, I'm trying to figure out how I can be ""gender-fluid"", that is ""multi-modal"", where in public i have to present as Cis-Gender White Male to be safe, but where in private i can present with skirts and other items that I feel validate my feminine / non-masculine aspects..

I guess what i'm asking for.. what strategies can I use to maintain my personal integrity, and validate myself, in a multi-modal context. 

I've been working on things like: 
A) in public, i am presenting the best aspects of my masculine self, in a compassionate way, that enables me to leverage ""white male priviledge"" to communicate pro womens/LGBT+ rights in a patriarchal environment safely. 
B) in private, I am presenting and nurturing other aspects of my self, that validate my femininity in balance with masculine and (god help me) technical side. 

The difficulty is, i've forced my self to stop shaving, and have had to give up all thoughts of HRT for the forseable 24 months.. And so i have to balance dysphoria with perception of safety. Being an aspie, I need to find a way to manage the constant anxiety regarding safety and inclusion that has played in my life, combined with trying to feel safe in this violently LGBT+ adverse environment. 

I appreciate all constructive input, no matter how challenging or controversial.

I'm trying to separate myself from my fears right now and really examine how I feel about my gender. So far I've realized that I like dressing up in certain contexts. When I'm lounging at home, playing video games, doing chores, or cooking I like dressing up and getting pretty. When I'm in meetings, running, hiking, paint balling, and doing outdoorsy stuff I like being a macho outdoorsman. Does anyone else feel this way? Are there any common signs of trans denial I could look for? Am I alone in feeling my gender is situational?\n\n\xa0 \n\nPS this is my porn alt so be careful with my post history :P"", 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'Does Anyone Else Find their Gender Situational?
