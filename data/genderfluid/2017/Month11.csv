2017-11-01 07:53:19,7a26rr,17,17,"I thought he was a friend I could trust. I came out to my close friends and family about a month ago. I've been having a hard time, on my 2nd outing I got a drink thrown on me when a cis-gender male up-downed me even though I wasn't putting out a vibe. Back story, I'm AMAB genderfluid/bi-gender, questioning sometimes if I'm full transgender. I also happen to be gynesexual if it matters.

The comment mixed with another female co-worker grabbing my hand and saying ""I've never noticed you paint your nails, why are you doing it?""

She's also been going around to our mutual friends and asking ""whats wrong with him? why is he painting his nails?"" She's been doing it under the pre-tense she cares about me, but in my circle we know she's being super catty.

It's been putting me in a shitty place, about a month ago was the first time I went out when it isn't Halloween, I went to an awesome concert. Put on my makeup, clothes, wig, heels, and felt super pretty. My sister said she's never seen such a big smile on my face when I showed her the pictures. 

It's been a tough month, I've also been working a lot. So my 2nd outing, my co-worker being shitty and catty, my friend saying ""you're being attention seeking"", and a date where I was very upfront about myself and she was trying to force me to prove my masculinity as well has given me a lot of stress.

About a month ago I finally allowed myself to become comfortable with a part of me thats existed for a very very long time. Without giving away too much info its been quite a few decades dealing with this and heavily closeting myself from realizing that I am genderfluid/bi-gender/trans. My therapist thinks I'm genderfluid/bi-gender and advised me to just live my life. 

I recently used the FaceApp and it made me look like a version of myself that I like. When I look in the mirror I've never been quite happy, but never could put my finger on it. People tell me I'm quite handsome, but I've never felt it. Even though I have some very masculine hobbies, I've always yearned to play with makeup, loved fashion, and heels.

Until recently finding out gender identity != sexuality, I didn't know people like me existed. That you could still be only attracted to cisgender women and still be the way I am.

2017-11-04 04:00:26,7aokv5,17,12,"I feel like something that doesn't exist.

It's not exact, though. And additionally I feel incredibly stupid and awkward and *illegitimate* for feeling like that.

Because you see, apparently I'm just an oddball of a (mostly)het cis guy, and yet.

And yet for something like half my life already I've felt something in my sense of gender is off. It's not even something I try to hide, it's something I've talked about with probably everybody important in my life. In a confused and oblique manner because I've never been actually sure what it IS or how to CALL it.

The most candid way to put it is this: It's okay to be a guy, I'm just bummed I only get to be a guy and have to be one all the time. In fact I'm bummed everyone [please feel free to dissent] has it like this, in my eyes it's like everybody is missing half (or more) of the picture. How very bummed I am about this fluctuates* over time.

I can relate to an extent with what trans people say, but I have no desire to be cut up or to have my sexuality scrutinized by doctors or shrinks and I'm totally fine with my genitals.

But frequently I also feel stumped because I can't animate my body properly because it won't move how I'd like it to; or self-conscious about how I animate it because I'm doing so in a way I feel it's patterned after how I've seen a girl do it.

How I feel about my physical features is an entirely mixed bag. Example: I like my chest hair but have several reasons for hating my beard. Fun fact: I don't have a visible adam's apple.

* I like girls to no end; I only like guys once in a blue moon and so far I haven't had sex with a guy; I can crush and swoon over both.
* I don't fit into male-exclusive groups. They make me antsy and defensive.
* I don't have an issue with either male or female pronouns (or adjectives, which are also gendered in Spanish, my native language)
* My sexual fantasies involve pretty much any combination even if in different proportions (hetero, lesbic, gay, trans of various kinds) and none of them is a required ""crutch""
* I might as well be invisible to cis-het girls: Every person who has had sex or a relationship with me, or admitted attraction or feelings to me, or pursued some sort of relationship with me has been either bisexual or trans or both. Makes you think.
* I don't like make-up save exceptions (on me or on others)
* I don't have an urge to crossdress but I'd so do it if I had a partner that was into it.
* I *DO* have an urge to sneakily express all this weirdness through my appearance and behavior. I don't want to make it my greeting card, but I want to be read by people that might react positively, everybody else just writes me off as an oddball (something which has pros and cons but which is largely unavoidable in my case). When everything falls in line I feel gorgeous and garner both male-oriented and female-oriented compliments. Takes a freaking planetary alignment or something though.

All in all, I don't want to change my body a lot or make a political point out of myself, but I would like to develop more freedom and control in using my body to express myself; and I don't really find myself in the gender identities I've familiarized myself with so far; elements yes but never the whole picture.

Help / advice / questions / bolts of enlightenment?

Sorry for the wall of text, the feeling of inadequacy was creeping up again and my quest brought me here. Thanks a lot for reading.

2017-11-13 07:25:09,7cljy2,1,2,"This week with me coming out at work and in my social circle was a whirlwind of big time changes in my life.  And so far, it has gone super good.

I was pleasantly surprised at how supportive my team members have been.  As I've mentioned before, my manager, who is somewhat conservative in his politics, has come to be one of my biggest supporters.  This has to do with the fact that he has a non-binary family member and has supported them from day one.  That brings the number of people on my team with trans/non-binary family members to three.  The rest of my team has taken it super good, even the guy who has been known to push the limit with his wisecracking jokes.  He did make a good natured joke with me, and I responded in kind.  Hopefully it shows him that I can still coke and joke with the best of them.

There is good news to also report at my house.  I live in a townhouse  that I bought a couple of months back, and came out to my gay neighbors.  They invited me over of course.  To my pleasant surprise, I learned that both of them have a non-mainstream experiences with gender, as one of them is FTM and the other identifies as androgynous but still considers himself male.  I wonder if one of my other neighbors might be trans as well.  I say that because I have a pretty good transdar and this person indicates to me.  That said, I figured that maybe seeing me being out, that they might reveal as such if it's the case.  So of the 8 units in our development, 2 are confirmed trans/non-binary households, and maybe another??

What can I say, I knew how to pick my job and my house quite well :)

The week was of course full of a lot of unpacking of my emotions, which were crazy powerful at times.  I was standing in my kitchen at one point, and it felt like I had a connection to a divine power of sorts.  I was able to sense that I was supposed to be the way I am, someone who can psychologically embody both masculine and feminine energy.  That said, I've been holding a masculine presentation for too long, and I VERY much enjoy getting in touch with my femininity.  I know my presentation is going to be femme of center for a while whenever practical, with maybe some androgynous or gender neutral days thrown in.  One very positive thing is that my desire to drink has gone way down.  While I wasn't getting black out drunk left and right, I was drinking to self-medicate my dysphoria.  In fact, I've only had 4 drinks in the last week.  Compared to 2-3 a night and sometimes more for the last several months is a major thing IMO.

There is still the road ahead, more people to come out to, and I know there's going to be a fair share of snags and bumps.  I've started coming out to more friends who I was previously closeted to, and so far they've all taken it fairly well.  While I'm not fully out on Facebook, I went a happy medium route and set up a filter to where people on the ""approved list"" get to see my full authentic self.  I'll eventually fully come out there, but this allows me to come out to as many of my close friends and extended family as possible outside of social media first.  While all of my immediate family has known how I relate to gender for almost a decade now, only two of them know how I'm currently proceeding.  It likely won't be a big shock to them per se, but I know my dad is likely going to be the most problematic about it.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed that he can at least grow to understand why I'm doing what I'm doing, and that we can continue to have a healthy relationship.  Another challenge will be several family members who are pretty religious.

While I wish I could have done this a long time ago, the fact is that I wasn't ready for it until now.  And now that this is reality for me, I am actually able to fully enjoy life.  Being a military veteran and having all of this coincide with Veteran's Day made me pause and think.

2017-11-13 13:10:23,7cmysw,4,3,"I posted this in the butch lesbian subreddit but I thought yall might have some insight too.

I’ve been a lesbian for a long time and I’ve never been into men, ever. I was femme for a few years and a little over a year ago I started becoming butch. (I’m turning 22 this week just for context)

But two weekends ago i went to see a trans guy friend and I realized I want to be his boyfriend? And that’s alarming not only because he is a guy but also because of the boyfriend thing.

And i kinda figured out that like, I can only see relationships as being of the same gender. Like, I’m his boyfriend, I’m my nonbinary partner’s partner, and if I dated a girl I’d be her girlfriend.

But that just... it seems so simple but I’m so uncomfortable going through my tumblr dash bc I followed so many lesbian blogs and now I can’t relate to them even tho I 100% did like *last week*, because there’s such a focus on anti-men sentiment and while I still feel that within myself from a woman’s perspective, I feel it very differently from the perspective of the trans gay man I guess I am as well.

I used to hate men and I have trauma with men and I’ve been gradually getting over that but a lot of things about manhood and  masculine culture trigger me especially IRT men being attracted to women... so that’s there too.

Also I don’t really feel like a real man??? I’ve felt like a “fake man” for a while now just as a butch lesbian because the idea of being butch (for me) was like, taking on a “man’s role” and playing a sort of pretend man, and that hasnt changed for me at all, what’s changed is that I actually prefer he/him pronouns when talking about my relationship with my boyfriend — basically that it’s gay.

At first I was terrified that I was misgendering my boyfriend because he’s trans and very feminine-presenting, but I don’t think that’s the case anymore, there have been times in the past where I considered that I can be attracted to men only if I see myself as one and over the week I have thought about fictional men in relation to myself as one rather than just using m/m ships and it actually feels natural, just like when I used to ship myself with female characters (of course, when that happens generally I still have long hair etc, i used to be very femme).  Also I know it’s normal for gay trans men to be attracted only to other trans men.

I don’t think I’m just a trans man though because I’m equally comfortable and uncomfortable with he/him pronouns and being assumed male as I am with she/her pronouns and being assumed female. I prefer not being gendered at ALL unless it’s in the context of being the same gender as my partner (or if I’m talking about like, someone being hot or cute etc). It makes me feel really uncomfortable thinking of myself as a man when I think about women, and it made me equally uncomfortable when my boyfriend called me “lady” when we were together.

And it makes the sexuality thing difficult because a lot of people on tumblr say you can’t be “male-aligned” (im still confused about what that means but that’s a whole other story, I’m going to guess I’m both male and female aligned) at any time and use the term wlw (women-loving-women). I don’t ID as a lesbian anymore unless it’s me explaining that I’m sometimes a lesbian and sometimes a gay man, but I thought that saying I’m both wlw and mlm (men-loving-men) would work. Now I’m not so sure. I still feel very strongly about keeping men out of lesbian-only spaces and I lean towards just interacting with those spaces only when I’m a woman (for example if I get a girlfriend and go to a lesbian event or something with her, idk), but I’ve seen posts that make me wonder if that’s still violating boundaries.

Those posts also make me wonder if this is a common experience at all. I’ve heard of lesbians becoming gay trans men, but I’ve never heard of someone being both at different times.

And I think I’m also shaken because I’ve had such a strong connection to lesbianism and the lesbian community (especially butch community over the past year) and now I don’t feel like I HAVE a community, except perhaps the genderfluid one but I don’t think my specific experience is a common one at all because mine is directly related to my partner(s) and I’ve never seen that before. I don’t feel like I have anything in common with bi people enough to call myself that and seek out that community because when I think of myself as a woman I’m ONLY attracted to women, and same for men. I can’t feel any different-gender attraction at all and that’s the entire point. It would feel wrong to say I’m bi.

And this might just seem like arbitrary label nonsense and I might just have to live with being in LGBT limbo for the rest of my life... I guess I’m just wondering if anyone else here has heard of this or (by some miracle) feels similarly.",genderfluid,Gender shifts to be the same as my partner?

OK let's stop wasting time. 

I'm a 22yr old AMAB. I grew up crossdressing, having fantasies of being a girl, always seemingly having more feminine characteristics than masculine. I'm cool with being a guy. I am. But when i do dress up, or when i do feel girly, i really enjoy it. I also love to have painted nails in public, and if i had enough confidence, i'd wear makeup too. I don't know if I'm genderfluid. I thought i was a few years ago after a huge urge, but im doing counseling, research, and other things to figure out. And I'm doing this post to see if anyone has similar events like mine. I'm also straight,not gay. I also love having long hair. I wish i can braid it someday. It's weird because i feel like I am stuck in this spectrum, and while thats fine, i sometimes feel like it would be better if i did have a label, at least i could say im genderfluid or something---IDK.. I really don't know. 

Any other AMABs out there still trying to figure it out, or kind of where i am? it's hard to explain.. I've been doing counseling for about a year and i feel like ive made little progress.

I grew up crossdressing, having fantasies of being a girl, always seemingly having more feminine characteristics than masculine. I'm cool with being a guy. I am. But when i do dress up, or when i do feel girly, i really enjoy it. I also love to have painted nails in public, and if i had enough confidence, i'd wear makeup too. I don't know if I'm genderfluid. I thought i was a few years ago after a huge urge, but im doing counseling, research, and other things to figure out. And I'm doing this post to see if anyone has similar events like mine. I'm also straight,not gay. I also love having long hair. I wish i can braid it someday. It's weird because i feel like I am stuck in this spectrum, and while thats fine, i sometimes feel like it would be better if i did have a label, at least i could say im genderfluid or something---IDK..

2017-11-23 05:49:15,7exhbi,3,1,"apologies for long post---i think im going on overload here.

AMAB, 22, long hair (been growing out). I guess with my long hair, i look kind of androgynous, especially since ive been misgendered as a woman. But hey, I don't have a problem, per se with my assigned gender, i guess... not yet.. idk.

I posted the other day after returning from a 2yr hiatus. I've been doing counseling at my college, ever since I a HUGE urge to crossdress 2 years ago, after a long time of not dressing up at all. At that time, I started to question if I was trans or not, just a crossdresser, or just a dude with weird habits. I don't like calling myself a crossdresser because I like to express some of my femininity in public, like getting my nails done (like, bright pink, acrylic nails). Since then, I've been getting advice, and ways to think about what the hell does this all mean. 

One of my goals is I want to be fully dressed up, makeup and everything, and truly look like a woman, because then, I could really see what it feels like, or something like that. but im scared to follow through with it.

 I could continue this longer but let me get to the point: 

After posting yesterday, and looking at the comments and advice (thank you to all who replied, really. &lt;3 ), I started just digging through this subreddit, reading other people's stories, finding relatability. I then started to question myself some more. 

I just recently (like 10 minutes ago) started to get frustrated because I don't want to be a crossdresser, but then I don't want to be trans, but I don't want to make this a big deal! I then texted my best friend about this, and she gave me some examples of some guys she knew and how they did certain girly things, but i dont know them, and I don't know if they are straight, white men. I don't know their stories, or if they've crossdressed. I started asking her tons of questions and then rapidly apologizing and telling her to forget what i said, because I felt like i was being stupid asking her and making a big deal out of it. and then, I just felt really bad about it. fast forward 10 minutes. Here I am, writing this block of text.

 Like i always ask myself, is this valid?? Am I lying to myself? But, wait, i do like painting my nails, I do like being girly, but is it just because I have these interests? does that make it less valid?? It's really annoying..

Now that I experienced that, I can't help but wonder if that was dysphoria. I don't know and that why im asking. If it is, then...idk. I guess maybe this is getting to a point where i need to really look into this.

but then again, AM I OVEREXAGGERATING? should i just say f--k it and do these things, or should I get better professional help? I think im going to talk with my counselor earilier than i had initially planned to talk with her because I set something up in january, but now i feel like i need to talk with her really soon. 

sorry for the long post. this hurts my brain.

When I feel particularly feminine, or ""FEEL LIKE A GIRL"", I don't really say ""i am a girl"" today, although I'll admit many of my masculinity dies for that time being when i am being feminine, but I like that.
