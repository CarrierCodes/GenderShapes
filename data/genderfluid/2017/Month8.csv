EDIT: Also, possible Trigger warning I'm realizing for sexual assault! Sorry!

I'm AFAB and genderfluid. I've known that for more than a decade after realizing I was not, in fact, a transman as I originally thought. I do identify more with the masculine than the feminine, even though I appear feminine. (Despite my best attempts, androgyny is beyond me.) Over the last few years, I've been working to actively embrace my feminine self as well. In general, I've become comfortable with both sides of myself, but today I'm having a weird issue. I don't know any other genderfluid people, and so, I'm posting here to see if anyone else might relate. Or if I'm maybe offbase on my theory. Or for support. I'm ... actually not really sure. 

So, the background story. I was walking in my city, and a man pulled over next to me on the street, got out of his car, and sexually assaulted me. It wasn't violent, but it was pushy and insistent, and it freaked me out. I had to push him away repeatedly, duck and move quickly, and he still tried to pull me away with him. I got away, and I've reported it to the police and charges have been pressed, but it's left me feeling uneasy.

I was dressed (and feeling) quite feminine, which is relatively unusual for me. But I've been trying to do that more often. He talked about liking ""women like me"" and described physical traits he liked about me, which managed to trigger some dysphoria too. 

Now, I feel anxious around men. I mean, all men. Men that are friends, family, coworkers, and all around genuinely good people I've known, in some cases, my entire life. I know I don't need to be afraid of them, so I know that it's anxiety. It may be important to know that I do have social anxiety disorder, so this isn't completely unexpected or out of left field. Some of it's familiar even. It's just odd (for me) to feel it around a particular gender instead of, well, everyone. I talked to a friend who'd been assaulted in the past and she told me she'd had the same feeling, so I accepted that it was probably ""normal"" or whatever, and figured it would go away when it goes away. I wasn't anxious around women or when alone, so as annoying as it is, I figured I could deal.

But today ... I feel very particularly masculine. I don't know if all genderfluid people are like this, but some days I feel passively one or the other gender and it changes, or kind of neither, and then some days I feel *particularly* one gender or the other. Today, I feel like a man. And I've been anxious since the second I woke up. Now, I'm sitting at my desk at work, and there's no men here ... except me. And I feel anxious. I couldn't figure it out. And then I had a thought.

... am I making myself feel anxious? Is that really where I'm at? Has anyone else ever experienced this? I can't think of what else it could be ...

I asked her brother about it and he rolled his eyes. ""Oh. Yeah, *that*. I blame the internet."" Not that I expected anything different from a cis man. Now, I don't know if my little cousin is Genderfluid or not, but she got her hair cut and is dressing in a very androgynous style which leads me to believe she's likely Genderfluid, Genderqueer or Agender (or maybe questioning Trans? Who knows.)

I feel bad for her, having her gender identity ignored or denied. Usually her brother is much more open to this sort of thing and is very empathetic. She's only 12 so I wonder if part of it is he thinks she's too young to understand gender identities.

I'm still in the closet so I can't support her very much, at least not openly, but I'd like to do *something* to help her. She's extremely shy, socially anxious and doesn't like to talk much.

When she was younger she was a wild child, always running around, hair flying, laughing and rough-housing. Now she's super shy, quiet, likes to be ignored, and is absolutely terrified of anyone watching her too closely. She's afraid of being judged.

Greetings, fellow human beings! I wanted to add the word lovely just before the word fellow, but I don't know how many people feel comfortable with this - since ""just because I feel comfortable with [insert thing], that doesn't mean everyone else will"" and yata yata. Anyhow, sorry for the mini tangent I'll just let it go with your existence is something that matters and is a pleasant thing existing in the universe. Now, moving on, I just thought I would leave a little life update here out of excitement. Feel free to ignore this, as it will probably be rambling even if [by some off chance and/or miracle] this turns out short. In fact, here's the cut off line! (Aka, click your backspace buttons now if you aren't up for good and/or random news).

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

Now, it has been a very long time since I posted here. As it turns out, my social anxiety wasn't ready for being in another minority community and I didn't have the usual logic to talk down that fear, despite being out both to [those ultimately significantly more important within my] immediate family and close friends. To cut it short: talking to strangers is still too difficult. So, to combat this in a continued effort to be more social and involved, I more or less gave up here and tried out the Gender Amino. I was just more familiar with it since I used it for being involved in the KPOP (or [K]orean [Pop] music) and Kdrama (or [K]orean ""soap opera"") community, so it wasn't a problem getting use to the format and in the end it turned out to be a better fit for me. I rarely ever use my cellphone, often forgetting it exists even until I need to make a call, check the time, or set some alarm - which is always a big shock for everyone as someone in my early 20s, so it was nice using the app and getting use to my phone more. I realized the negative effect on my wrist quickly as I got more involved, making me recall the good old days of having a literal physical keyboard attached to my phones but that's another story for another time. Basically, I got to be the ""good old hippie/Mother-Theresa"" figure I am and got to give a lot of seemingly helpful advice - but before I move on my anxiety is screaming to say sorry to anyone that offended (religious or otherwise) with that ""nickname""/label. I have a tendency to have these kinds of overly-nurturing labels attached to myself most of the time by other people and thought that choice of words would better exploit that fact since you're reading this through a screen without having seen the actual actions associated. 

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

But anyway, the main point here is that it was great for me and my worrying mother instincts for random strangers. I got to talk to a variety of people, confused and otherwise, and it felt nice to give them some grounding. For a long time now I have felt this kind of thing was my calling, as corny as that sounds. I actually tend to be good at this kind of thing (that being giving others some form of closure in life), so it feels good and right to exercise this talent somewhere. Due to social anxiety and depression I don't often communicate or socialize with other people aside from my online instances with close friends, so helping others closer to acquaintances or strangers is fulfilling - and this app is great for that. While it may not be anonymous, there is advice, support, and love coming from every angle through all the advice-seeking or emotional support-needing posts because we all understand being different in gender (although truly it might take a while to get some feedback, unless its from me or a few other specific people since a handful of us are always haunting around it feels like). So, I would love to encourage anyone here to join. The bad, the good, the boring - it's all welcomed there. Much like here, its all free to share and free to engage without the need to be too active or barely active. Just, ya know, mobile.

Getting to the good stuff, in an effort to keep spreading that good internal peace and continue to stubbornly not give up on a dying dream, I am writing a book. I have made efforts towards my makeshift forced dream of being an author literally since childhood, but more often than not I struggle to find individuality as a writer and give up due mainly to dissatisfaction in my writing skill despite small success here and there. I decided to abandon this many years ago once the anxiety got bad and a great fear of having actual readers that weren't classmates or certain people in my family set in out of no where, yet here we are and once again here I am back struggling with my fingertips over the keys. Surprisingly enough, however, I've got several chapters of this book written so far and it's going well. While I wasn't expecting this progression, I'm not unhappy or at all overwhelmed with it. It's taken me a very long time to accept a change in this goal - how I'm going to write, what I'm going to write about, how I could make people care enough to read it from my perspective as the author instead of the reader. I went through several years of forming different styles with the help of my many fanfictions (I know, I know, but trust me there are some fanfiction that are true masterpieces). I honestly don't think I have grasped a certain style just yet, but I've found a way to be comfortable and accepting towards my writing and expectations. I just didn't think it would actually work out, doubtful depression aside. I never thought I would be able to write seriously again and enjoy/approve of it (I am my own worst critic, as most of us are, but my depression is also a harsh judge). But somehow I have been able to so far and its all working out. Somehow this is going well, skill aside. My planning foresight is still an advantage as well, I've got all kinds of things prepared long term and I'm almost overjoyed. So, while things are in full swing for the time being, I just thought I would come to announce the good news. If it actually ends up getting finished, you'll be the first to know after my editors and beta-readers(?). Just to finish this little section up, I also want to announce the subject of the book. Continuing with the corniness, it is a book about being genderfluid (as well as nonbinary, lesbian in a different kind of relationship, asexual, bisexual, pansexual, and other things I'm missing that my mind blanked out on). I know, I know, but I said I like helping people with self-acceptance, right? Besides, they always say ""write what you know"", right? So, as a writer, this is just what I plan to do. But have no deep seeded worries, this won't at all be a self-help book - because personally I can't stand those. It will be character and group focused and contain an actual story line from their many different perspectives in this world with these many different identities. And yes, I am avidly doing my research despite being able to understand and relate to most of these genders/sexualities as a genderfluid pansexual. Because after all, perspective is still everything.

And now to bring this to an end, I'm sorry it was pretty long and pretty informally written. I wish I could have written this a whole lot better, but I honestly wasn't planning on writing any of this at all in the first place. It was a sort of impulse decision, meaning I won't be editing too much of it either. Well, at least until the book goes on the market. Then you might want to expect this entire post to look a little more professional just because of my insecurity to appear as well-put as possible (especially privately and/or personally - and this counts as both for me). Anyway, if you got this far for some unknown reason, thank you for reading. I appreciate you wasting your time on this little update. I'm glad to be back, although I probably won't be around here any more than I already am. Now, back to catching up on those threads...

{EDIT} I forgot to add this into the mix, but I finally wore my packer after weeks of having it. There were some issues with getting packing underwear, but that's finally done and over with so I got to try it out. To sum up the experience and spare your eyes: I felt giddy. It was a magical experience. All I did was walk around my empty at the time house and wonder how those with biological penis deal with having balls. I am now looking into buying a cloth packer, or really just a cheap [but preferably still of good quality] packer, and probably some ""Joeys"" packer holders to sleep in - as sleeping in the ReelMagik soft version packers is not a good idea from what I can gather from others with the same quality packer.

I wish I could have written this a whole lot better, but I honestly wasn\'t planning on writing any of this at all in the first place. It was a sort of impulse decision, meaning I won\'t be editing too much of it either. Well, at least until the book goes on the market. Then you might want to expect this entire post to look a little more professional just because of my insecurity to appear as well-put as possible (especially privately and/or personally - and this counts as both for me). Anyway, if you got this far for some unknown reason, thank you for reading. I appreciate you wasting your time on this little update. I\'m glad to be back, although I probably won\'t be around here any more than I already am. Now, back to catching up on those threads...\n\n{EDIT} I forgot to add this into the mix, but I finally wore my packer after weeks of having it. There were some issues with getting packing underwear, but that\'s finally done and over with so I got to try it out. To sum up the experience and spare your eyes: I felt giddy. It was a magical experience. All I did was walk around my empty at the time house and wonder how those with biological penis deal with having balls. I am now looking into buying a cloth packer, or really just a cheap [but preferably still of good quality] packer, and probably some ""Joeys"" packer holders to sleep in - as sleeping in the ReelMagik soft version packers is not a good idea from what I can gather from others with the same quality packer.\n', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'Miniature Life Update (That No One Asked For)', 'created': 1503765043.0}"

2017-08-27 18:33:06,6wdurh,2,3,"Hi, 
I just found this subreddit and I thought maybe some of you might have advice? I started questioning my gender about 7/8 months ago and didn't take long to realise I was genderfluid once I found out about it. The thing is, I haven't been out about it other than to my twin and people online, because I know my mum( who doesn't mean to but says a lot of transphobic stuff, and doesn't think that nonbinary identities are a thing) would not accept it, and be upset. 
Thing is, about 3 months ago, I started dating a friend of mine, and I want to tell her. I have no reason to think she'll react badly - she's wonderful and accepting and we've had conversations about how awful transphobia is before and so on. But I'm just so scared - especially as one of the few people I told reacted badly at first. I'm also worried she'll be upset I didn't tell her sooner, but I've been trying. I'm just so worried. She thinks she's dating a girl and I feel like I'm lying to her, every time I go along with it because I'm not a girl, at least not a lot of the time. I just don't know what to do. 
I know this is probably silly, I was just hoping that someone might have some advice, either in telling her or helping her not feel like I don't trust her, because I do, I'm just a coward. Too many people are unaccepting and it terrifies me.

2017-08-28 10:14:31,6wihkg,2,9,"Hi,

So all my life I've felt okay with being boy. Since I was a child I've always wanted to be a girl, but I haven't had any massive issues with being male as far as I'm aware of.

However... lately I've been going to the gym to keep fit, but I've also been attempting to bulk up. Today whilst at the gym I felt a momentary, intense panic at the thought of becoming more muscular. I've always had a slim body type, and the prospect of losing this body type, of becoming more physically masculine in appearance and moving away from a more typically feminine frame, made me scared. The thought passed.

I'm relatively straight, although I also find men attractive and would probably have sex with one. The reason I'm saying this was yesterday on the bus I saw a good looking girl. I thought 'I want to have sex with that girl'. But I also felt an intense jealously of her. Her clothes, her body language, the way she was acting - I wanted to be that.

I'm only 21, but I'm also beginning to feel panicky that time is running out for me to enjoy my youth as a feminine being.
Has anybody else felt this way? The thing is, I don't 100 per cent hate being a man. I've had plenty of fulfilling relationships with women as a man, and I've enjoyed presenting to the world as a man. I don't know if this is just me covering up.

I suspect I might fall somewhere under genderfluid, and for the first time in my life I'm being open to any femininity I might have. My issue is that I want to be two different things at once. How can I shave my body, lose muscle fat, wear female clothes and generally adopt more feminine traits, whilst at the same time also wanting to be masculine, muscular, bearded and so on. My personal preference is that I wouldn't feel comfortable incorporating the same two at the same time e.g. choosing to keep my body hair whilst also wearing make up. That's fine if anybody wants to be that way! But its not how I see my gender, I see it more as being one or the other. I'm just not sure which.

Thanks for reading.",genderfluid,panic and questioning,1503940471.0,"{'created_utc': 1503915271, 'id': '6wihkg', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 9, 'selftext': ""Hi,\n\nSo all my life I've felt okay with being boy.

Part of this is venting, the other part is sort of asking for advice or just...anyone else who has this going on.
