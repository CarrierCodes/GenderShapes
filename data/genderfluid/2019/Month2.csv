2019-02-05 01:02:55,an8oop,0,1,"Hi there! I have just been sitting here looking at my hands... and thinking and wondering about something I’ve felt for a long time. It’s always been confusing seeing trans people, lesbians, etc and feeling like there really hasn’t been something clear I’ve been able to identify with. I’m not a woman who feels like a man exactly and I’m not a true lesbian. I like both men and women, but feel like I also go between feeling like this weirdly masculine person in a petite body and with an ultra feminine natural appearance. 

So... I guess I’m trying to figure it out? I feel like socially I’m a guy most of the time, I can’t like geek out with girls and I’m always super awkward around a table of women. I usually then gravitate toward the men who tend to not always get me or get why I’m trying to talk to them. I feel more like I belong with guys, socially... but then I don’t feel accepted by them. I’m just trying to figure it out because I’m generally fine with being a woman, I just feel like I’m a certain kind that isn’t like... the average one? Something about how I connect to people, I’m fairly distant and vague and stoic, like men can often be with one another. I either shut off emotionally or I’m very emotional. Much honestly, again like I think men can be too. 

Then there are just things I’m not super feminine about and never have been. But I feel like people want me to be. I always get compliments when I wear a dress... and... yeah it kind of sucks honestly. Anyway, idk just putting some thoughts out there because I’m feeling kind of lost and down. It’s like I never belong with anyone. Gender fluid seems like it makes sense.. sometimes I go between two genders when I masturbate, it’s weird.

I have just been sitting here looking at my hands... and thinking and wondering about something I’ve felt for a long time. It’s always been confusing seeing trans people, lesbians, etc and feeling like there really hasn’t been something clear I’ve been able to identify with. I’m not a woman who feels like a man exactly and I’m not a true lesbian. I like both men and women, but feel like I also go between feeling like this weirdly masculine person in a petite body and with an ultra feminine natural appearance. \n\nSo... I guess I’m trying to figure it out? I feel like socially I’m a guy most of the time, I can’t like geek out with girls and I’m always super awkward around a table of women. I usually then gravitate toward the men who tend to not always get me or get why I’m trying to talk to them. I feel more like I belong with guys, socially... but then I don’t feel accepted by them. I’m just trying to figure it out because I’m generally fine with being a woman, I just feel like I’m a certain kind that isn’t like... the average one? Something about how I connect to people, I’m fairly distant and vague and stoic, like men can often be with one another. I either shut off emotionally or I’m very emotional. Much honestly, again like I think men can be too. \n\nThen there are just things I’m not super feminine about and never have been. But I feel like people want me to be. I always get compliments when I wear a dress... and... yeah it kind of sucks honestly. Anyway, idk just putting some thoughts out there because I’m feeling kind of lost and down. It’s like I never belong with anyone. Gender fluid seems like it makes sense.. sometimes I go between two genders when I masturbate, it’s weird. Like I can embody both genders at different times... and both makes sense to me.

2019-02-06 18:20:58,antoq0,12,1,"As per my last post on this sub Reddit I and my gender psychiatrist appointment today, this is a post about it, warning it is long, there is a tldr down the bottom.

So at the appointment, the doctor is an old guy, going over basic stuff, general/family history, friends and so on. After that we went onto the crux's of the matter, my gender dysphoria I get sometimes with being genderfluid. He gets confused about the term so I explain it to him, at which point he proclaims that there is nothing that he or anyone else could do but ""wait for my mind to make up its mind which gender (male or female was implied at this point) it wanted to be"". This is about 25-30 minutes into the appointment. 

At this point I realise that it's going to be a fight and launch straight into ""there is more than two genders"" teaching mode, with examples in genetics, nature and even in some  societies. During this time he does the ""I'm listening but I'm not and my mind is already made up look"" but I do the whole speel. At the end of it he says that there is nothing anyone can do till my mind is made up on a gender and I decide if I want to transition fully or not.

So at this point I grab my stuff, say a hurried bye and leave, being supremely pissed off that I wasn't listened to and that he didn't even try to understand what I was telling him. So this eventually becomes the minor panic attack I thought it would become after the initial rage weared off, by then I had made the short walk home and thankful my lovely partner was there to help me calm down before it spiraled any worse.

After calming down I go back and request an appointment with a different psychiatrist, asking for someone who had experience or training with non binary (NB) people. The receptionist had no idea about NB stuff so passed it onto the duty officer, had a short chat with them, they didn't know much either but they said they would get me the appointment with the other psychiatrist there once they had talked to the medical secretary.

While walking me back out we bumped into the medical secretary, they go off and have a quick talk while I wait for a couple of minutes. I was surprised when I was asked if I was okay to have another chat with the two of them this time.

Once back in the private room the medical secretary asked me what I would like to be called, the first medical professional in the entire time I was there to ask me. She was kind and actually talked to be about how this all worked, that the psychiatrist does the initial knowledge gathering which is then passed onto the gatekeeper (no joke, was the word they used) and that they are the ones to make the decision and that it was policy that the info gets passed on no matter what the psychiatrist thinks. She also then informed me that the psychiatrist was new to the centre, had little or no training about gender stuff and I was his second gender related case there.

I thanked her for giving me more information and reassurence in 10 minutes than the psychiatrist had in an hour. She saved what would have been a super shitty day otherwise. 

Once I got home I got a call a few minutes later from her letting me know that my case had been sent through to the gatekeeper and wished me the best of luck. 

So I just have to wait 4 years now, which is short compared to some places in the UK, to see if something come from this.

Tldr: had my ""gender"" psychiatrist appointment today, psychiatrist was an ass who either didn't want to listen and or care and the day was saved by my wonderful partner and a very knowledgeable medical secretary who deserves an award or something.

I'm not sure if this is the right forum for this or not, and if it's not then please feel free to remove this. 

I think I'm finally realizing that I'm genderfluid. I'm AMAB, married to a wonderful woman (cis,bi), but all my life I've felt more feminine than masculine. I've never felt the traditional machoness that society says we need to feel but I've struggled in being comfortable with my own masculinity. I've always been closer to girls, and had more girl friends than guys as a kid growing up. 

I've crossdressed, and crossdreamt so many times I can't keep count. I've dreamt over and over of buying that pretty dress on h&amp;m or those cute panties on aerie but never did. I've watched makeup tutorials and browsed make up but never went ahead with it. Mainly because I was confused. I didn't think I was Trans. I didn't think I was female enough on the inside. I didn't think I wanted to be on hormones or even give up my masc side. I guess a part of me liked doing things as a man, wearing boxers, having a beard. 

I grew up in India, in what would be a good conservative society that didn't even decriminalize homosexuality until very recently. Maybe my conservative upbringing was clashing with my femme side? 

And even now, a part of me thinks about me in a dress or a skirt or lingerie and I think to myself ""I'm a dude. It's so silly"" but I guess I've finally realised it thanks to you wonderful people. Your posts and pictures have inspired me to come out to myself as genderfluid. I don't have to be 100% masc nor do I have to be 100% femme. I just need to be myself or myselves. I have a femme side and a masc side. And all those times I said no to the dress or the makeup was my masc side. 

I think I'm beginning to understand the two sides of me, and I'm slowly going to explore this, read up on it and understand more about myself before I can come out to my wife. I don't know that I'll come out to the public ever, but I can't keep these sides of me hidden from my wife for long. I'm so thankful to you guys for helping me realise who I am, and if all goes well I will be leaning on you for support before I tell my wife.

As the title says, I'm currently questioning whether I'm genderfluid or not. I've always liked crossdressing since I did it once just because (no real reason to it), and since then I've had two cravings to crossdress and pretend like I'm a guy.

I usually don't think about my gender and kind of behave gender neutral, but when I do think of my gender half the time I feel feminine and comfortable in my body, and the other half of the time I wish I was a guy.

Maybe this is because being a guy seems easier from my perspective, or maybe I really am genderfluid. But in the meantime, I'm identifying with genderfluid just because I want to try it out.

I then lived as female, dated and then married my straight, cis-male best friend. I'm now 24 and really, reaaallly not coping.

I've been having a shit ton of therapy to deal with the assorted mess that is my brain, and the recurring theme that just won't go away is that I'm a bit (a lot) of a self sacrificing idiot who would rather be miserable for eternity than hurt the people I love. I know, pretty stupid way to live. Anyway, I've rather abruptly reached the I Can't Anymore stage and have an overwhelming need to just be myself, fuck what that might mean for the world around me.

I don't think I'm trans, but I do have massive amounts of disphoria around my body most of the time. I think I'm probably gender fluid but honestly, I don't really know. 

My main problem is my husband. I love him to pieces, and if I decided to transition fully I know he'd try and find a way to be ok with it, but he loves my body the way I am and I don't want to destroy our relationship. 

Has anyone else dealt with this kind of thing? How did your partners deal with issues of disphoria? Honestly, I would love any advice about any of this because I'm confused and terrified and I don't know how to deal with anything right now.

As a genderfluid person, it really made me think. Personally I feel gender dysphoria when I’m a girl (I’m afab) and body dysphoria when I’m a boy or enby, but none of those are guaranteed when I’m experiencing a certain gender or shift.

There were a few problems though, which is why I’m posting this here. We went to the mall and had a good time, but each time that I bought a necklace or anything that was typically for girls, since I’m AMAB and she’s AFAB, the cashiers would always look at her and ask if she wanted a bag to carry the items in, when the stuff was for me and I was paying. It kinda felt invalidating. Even though I definitely wasn’t dressed to look like a girl, it still sucked that they didn’t even consider the possibility that the stuff was for me and that I’m just not out yet. Idk.

I came out as a gay man in college, and am happily married to a wonderful man. I've been told that I ""hide"" my homosexuality well (which i take to mean that I present as masculine; I make no effort to keep my sexual orientation a secret).

Even now, I love dressing up in robes and kilts and skirted attire far more than in pants. I own a caftan that I only ever dare wear around the house. Being told unironically that I'm ""pretty"" thrills me way more than being told I'm ""handsome"", which feels like it doesn't fit.

Ok so I see lots of people who seem happy being genderfluid, and even proud of it. Nothing wrong with that, I'm not judging them



But i can't connect with them because honestly I just hate hate **HATE** being genderfluid. Dysphoria with no ending in sight? Hate from both cis and trans people (including other enbies!?!?!)? Being labelled as sick, confused, or wrong?



I honestly hate alnost every aspect of being genderfluid. However, it has given me perspective that has informed my development of empathy for others. So weird enough, I hesitate to say I would actually go through with ""un-genderfluid-ing"" myself. But besides that, I really really don't like being this way. It makes me so depressed

However, I'm planning to order a custom-made costume that includes a bra component, and one of the measurements that the seller is requesting is bra size. 

I've picked up a few bras for costumes in the past but they always felt very tight and I don't think the sizing was correct. Since the costume I'm planning on ordering is a tad on the pricey side, I'd like to be reasonably certain that I have an accurate measurement beforehand so that I'm satisfied with what I get.

Now that I've laid out the context, can anyone offer advice on how I'd go about finding the correct bra size?
