2019-04-03 16:26:55,b905im,1,28,"Recently found this sub and have been lurking, first post, so sorry if this isn't very well put together, I'm not great at putting my thoughts into words.

Tl;dr I'm confused, and just want to be supportive, but it's hard when you don't know who you are.

A few weeks ago, my spouse and I were doing a lot of soul searching. And we came to some conclusions together. They've finally accepted that they are trans, and I'm so happy for them. They seem so much happier when we're home and they can be who they were meant to be. 

But I also realized that I am not what I was born as either, but I'm not as confident in myself. I've always fought with depression, anxiety, and a slew of other problems, so I've felt like I lost my true self a long time ago, and this has just kind of. Made things worse? I feel like I'm living even more of a lie than before any time i have to go out. And when I'm at work. I've always hated my body, with the exception of my breasts, and while I dont like some things about them I've always taken pride in the way they look in the right bras. But now they just make me uncomfortable. 

I know binders are a thing, I've wanted one since I was a teen (I'm 25 now) but I've never had the money, and I'm so paranoid about getting the wrong size. And i want to get a packer as well.

My spouse has been super supportive, and we've been helping each other out as much as possible, trading clothes and such, but I feel like a child playing dress up. They say I look good but all I can see is someone dressed in clothes that don't fit, trying to be something they're not, while feeling jealous that they look like the girl I've always wanted to be, while still being the kind of guy I want to be.

Meanwhile, we've been using preferred pronouns, and while I like being called he, sometimes it irritates me, but I dont want to be called she either. And they keep talking about things like I want to fully transition with them. Things like when we go on hormones. And I dont know what I want yet.

But that's the biggest problem I think. Is that I dont know what I want, besides to not be a girl? But I still like the idea of doing my makeup (not that I can do makeup), and putting on a pretty dress, and going out into the world. And I want to grow my hair out long again, because I used to have hair down to my waist, but it gets a certain length and I cant stand it any more and cut it again. 

And my brain keeps saying I'm being stupid, and just copying my spouse and I'll get over it, but I've had these feelings since I was a teenager, and I know they aren't invalid and I won't just get over it.

But now they just make me uncomfortable. \n\nI know binders are a thing, I've wanted one since I was a teen (I'm 25 now) but I've never had the money, and I'm so paranoid about getting the wrong size. And i want to get a packer as well.\n\nMy spouse has been super supportive, and we've been helping each other out as much as possible, trading clothes and such, but I feel like a child playing dress up. They say I look good but all I can see is someone dressed in clothes that don't fit, trying to be something they're not, while feeling jealous that they look like the girl I've always wanted to be, while still being the kind of guy I want to be.\n\nMeanwhile, we've been using preferred pronouns, and while I like being called he, sometimes it irritates me, but I dont want to be called she either. And they keep talking about things like I want to fully transition with them. Things like when we go on hormones. And I dont know what I want yet.\n\nBut that's the biggest problem I think. Is that I dont know what I want, besides to not be a girl? But I still like the idea of doing my makeup (not that I can do makeup), and putting on a pretty dress, and going out into the world. And I want to grow my hair out long again, because I used to have hair down to my waist, but it gets a certain length and I cant stand it any more and cut it again. \n\nAnd my brain keeps saying I'm being stupid, and just copying my spouse and I'll get over it, but I've had these feelings since I was a teenager, and I know they aren't invalid and I won't just get over it.

I absolutely love them. When I put them on I feel so good, and empowered, and confident. When I put them on I just get this tingle of excitement, and a big smile on my face.

2019-04-05 23:25:49,b9y5wb,11,15,"Hi there!

(This is going to be a long one, so I'm warning you now.)

I'd just like to say I'm new to the sub but I've identified as genderfluid for a few years now. While I still technically view myself as genderfluid, I've gotten some really rude and upsetting comments from a few friends and associates in the genderfluid and trans* spectrums that really have me second thinking myself and my ""official"" label.

(I've gotten comments from my family too because they don't believe gender can be fluid.)

At first, I ignored the comments because I knew who I was. But now, after a few years of constantly dealing with them it's really starting to affect my mental health.

(I do see a counselor, but it's not as helpful as talking to other people who are within my spectrum.)

A little backstory before moving on:

I'm a 25 yo pansexual biological female. I've never seen colours, makeup or clothes as things that should be associated with gender and I've always been a openminxed. I came out as bi my freshman year of high school &amp; then I realized I was actually pan at 17. A lot of my friends between now &amp; then were part of the LGBT+ community, even my mother who was bisexual at the time.

I never really had a major issue when I realized I was genderfluid. I just knew that some days I felt very uncomfortable being called a girl. It confused me at first, but after talking to a friend of mine that was non-binary I figured out what was going on with me. So I spent a few months soul searching, trying to figure out how exactly it was that I felt when it finally hit me that I was fluid. Most of the time I felt in between, but I had days when I felt particularly masculine or female.

My main pronouns are She/Her &amp; Them/They.
On my masculine days I prefer He/Him or Them/They.

Back to the problem at hand:

Sometimes on my masculine days I would wear skirts, 'girly' colours, and even low cut tops. Hell, sometimes wore makeup as well. I never really saw a problem with it. I was comfortable to me and it didn't make me feel uneasy.

However, it upset my friends. I would get pulled to the side and asked why I was wearing what I had on, or they would tell me I was confused and it was confusing them. A few former friends even accused me of faking being genderfluid for attention.

In the beginning I would ignore it and tell them to believe what they wanted to believe but as time went on I found myself trying to explain to people why I was okay dressing how I did when I was having a ""HE"" day.

On top of that my mother and sister told me I was confused because there were only two genders: Male and Female. Because I had a vagina, I wasn't allowed to be fluid to them. The only way they would call me a he is if I was trans*.

It's gotten to the point that when I do have masculine days, I suppress that part of me or I retreat into the comfort of my own room and ignore everybody.

It makes me so uncomfortable that I can't be myself without someone judging me. Strangers I don't mind but when it's my friends and family, it hurts.

And now here I am second guessing myself, wondering if I can even consider myself genderfluid. There's just so much going on in my mind and it's raising my anxiety through the roof.

My family isn't supportive of my gender fluidity and my friends think I'm faking it because I wear 'girly' things on my masculine days.

But I guess my post is a bit of a debbie downer...

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially I'm struggling with this gender dysphoria that I've been feeling recently. I basically met an awesomely supportive friend, and I've essentially told them I'm bigender/genderfluid. The problem being, I feel strange telling this to her, because of how often I've just presented myself as cishet male. I'm not, I know I'm not, but I've just done it out of convenience and for people I don't know well enough or who aren't open enough to people being benderfluid/genderqueer. And this brought back a flood of feelings that I usually suppress in some morning when I wake up. Feelings of ""hey, I feel cute today, I want to express that cuteness with a dress or a cute top and a skirt or something."" But I never do, or I keep it at home. Like, I feel bad that I call myself genderfluid when I haven't really expressed that in non-LGBT exclusive places. I'm sure I have opportunities to express my femininity in public every day, like just spending the day at the coffee shop studying, but I never do. I don't have the courage, because I just hate the feeling of being judged, stared at, nitpicked for not being as pretty or looking as feminine as the transwomen that are visible nowadays. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I want to with her. I want to go and study, presenting female, not caring what other people think. But I don't think I can. It's like I can't. I can't ignore the things that bother me about my body. My arms, my jaw, my hips, my rear. It's just all proportioned wrong and essentially I wish I had the power to shapeshift. But I can't see myself waking up tomorrow and seriously saying eff the world and do what I want to do. I can't see myself putting on the mask of makeup I hide behind and think it perfect enough to see the light of day.

Bodyswap fiction, shapeshifting fiction...I've always found stuff like this erotic, but beyond the sexual component, I think it's generally fascinating.

In addition to mere fascination with gender ""swapping"" in fiction, sometimes I would crossdress in private when I was between 12-15 years old (not sure how many times, but it was definitely most prominent during this range). Since then, I've done it maybe 5 times or less. Since I turned 25, I've done it 0 times. In a nutshell, I'd find women undergarments in the house and wear them in private, and get a thrill from it.

As for what I do now, I still watch and even create fiction that involves male to female transformations, whether that be bodyswaps, or shapeshifts etc. Sometimes, that's done from my first-person POV; for example, me becoming a female celebrity and how I would react and express myself in that situation.

So, I don't know where this leaves me. I've read about gender dysphoria and the common feelings associated with it, and I click some but not all of the boxes. For example, I feel there's a feminine side of myself I don't get to express, and instead have to live as a typical, bland guy everyday. That said, I don't have any animosity towards having a penis. The biggest thing that I feel, viscerally, is the inability to express a part of myself.

I also worry about this sort of non-binary behavior being accepted by cis-women in a dating context. But I suppose that shouldn't even be a concern, since if they can't accept who I fully am, then I shouldn't date them. Also, I shouldn't assume that ""expressing a feminine side"" entails huge swaths of makeup or significant crossdressing...I suppose it can be more subtle.

He looks at me and says ""u sure, man?""  (I got pearl studs in my ears, foundation, color, corner 2 corner eyeliner and mascara going but otherwise rep'n a masc tank and denim, lol)  

***CLARIFICATION/DISCLAIMER #1: I live in the U.S.A., specifically California. So even though I consider my hometown pretty conservative, it's still a very safe environment to behave this way relative 2 many places in the World where it is inherently dangerous to simply ""be"" LGBTQ, and practically suicidal to be out in any way 💔💔💔 For that, I am so, so humbly and categorically grateful ❤❤❤ END DISCLAIMER ***

""Yeah, fer sher man, it's 2 nice a day 2 be in a hurry"" I sez

He squeezes by and starts scanning his stuff... keeps glancing back... not quite looking at me... he finally looks back at me and says ""hey man, u mind if I ask... r u wearing cologne?""

I grin and think *here we go*... I say ""nah man..."" chuckling a little...

***(btw it's Looking Glass by Derek Lam from Nordstrom 😍😍😍)***

He says ""oh, ok... &lt;long pause&gt; ur not wearing aftershave or something...?""

I'm still chucking and poor guy is struggling 😂 so I help him out.  I nod and say ""yeah, I'm wearing 'fragrance', but it's not cologne...""

He tries to save me like folks do sometimes when they r trying to be sensitive and respectful but suddenly realize they're in way deeper than they ever intended 2 be and have no idea how not to come across awkward... I can't hardly contain myself at this point - poor bastard can't know how NOT offended or threatened I felt 😂 but jeez he's doing his best, God bless him...

""Oh, yeah ok!!! It smells f'n good man!"" he sez in premature relief. ""Is that what it's called? Like, instead of 'cologne', or 'eu de whatever' it's called 'fragrance'?""

""Nah man, it's perfume. It's like 'women's perfume'. And thanks man! I like it 2, lol, that's why I wear it.""

He was so happy and relieved (real this time, lol) that I was so totally dgaf about it. ""Wow, ok man, yeah that makes sense then! MAN! That smells so good!"" he says... then he looks at me and says ""I'm not trying 2 be weird, man, but can I..."" 

""Of course, brother ❤""  I open my arms up and wave him in and, sure as s**t, he leans in and smells my chest lmao 😂 

***CLARIFICATION/DISCLAIMER #2: I'm 6'+ and semi-athletic. My 1st career (a ""past life"" to be melodramatic, lol) was an inherently martial one. I am terribly good at reading people via both training and natural intuition. I was in no danger, regardless of how accurate I was about his real intentions. So many creeps and a**holes do similar things to people in a predatory way. I don't ""get afraid"" in situations like that and it's not Privilege I'm proud of 💔😔 however, this story is meant to be fun and uplifting - one that shows how kindness between 2 people is so cool when someone corrects their thinking for the better mid-convo  like my man in this tale ❤❤❤ END DISCLAIMER***

""Damn that smells good!!! Where'd u get it?"" He realizes he's way more excited and intimately engaged with a stranger than any normal circumstance would justify but at the same time felt safe that could compliment me and discuss 'perfume' ☺

""Nordstrom... and it better smell good 4 what I paid 4 it"" we laughed 2gether it was awesome ❤

He said, ""I swear I'm not trying 2 hit on u or anything, but can... I...""

""C'mon, yeah, bring it in..."" he smelled my shirt again, like deep lol 😂 

I made him write it down. I told him he'd get 100 yards out of the parking lot and forget so he did. 

Cool cat, that dude. I hope he was legit that cool with folks like us or, better, he wasn't but is now 👍🌈

Oh, then the sweet old lady behind me when dude left... ""U get that a lot don't u?"" fuk me I'm ded 😂😂😂😂😂😂

A dude settles in behind me with 2 things in his hand so I\'m like, ""hey, brother, u wanna jump up here and get thru?""\n\nHe looks at me and says ""u sure, man?""  (I got pearl studs in my ears, foundation, color, corner 2 corner eyeliner and mascara going but otherwise rep\'n a masc tank and denim, lol)  \n\n***CLARIFICATION/DISCLAIMER #1: I live in the U.S.A., specifically California. So even though I consider my hometown pretty conservative, it\'s still a very safe environment to behave this way relative 2 many places in the World where it is inherently dangerous to simply ""be"" LGBTQ, and practically suicidal to be out in any way 💔💔💔 For that, I am so, so humbly and categorically grateful ❤❤❤ END DISCLAIMER ***\n\n""Yeah, fer sher man, it\'s 2 nice a day 2 be in a hurry"" I sez\n\nHe squeezes by and starts scanning his stuff... keeps glancing back... not quite looking at me... he finally looks back at me and says ""hey man, u mind if I ask... r u wearing cologne?""\n\nI grin and think *here we go*... I say ""nah man..."" chuckling a little...\n\n***(btw it\'s Looking Glass by Derek Lam from Nordstrom 😍😍😍)***\n\nHe says ""oh, ok... &lt;long pause&gt; ur not wearing aftershave or something...?""\n\nI\'m still chucking and poor guy is struggling 😂 so I help him out.  I nod and say ""yeah, I\'m wearing \'fragrance\', but it\'s not cologne...""\n\nHe tries to save me like folks do sometimes when they r trying to be sensitive and respectful but suddenly realize they\'re in way deeper than they ever intended 2 be and have no idea how not to come across awkward... I can\'t hardly contain myself at this point - poor bastard can\'t know how NOT offended or threatened I felt 😂 but jeez he\'s doing his best, God bless him...\n\n""Oh, yeah ok!!! It smells f\'n good man!"" he sez in premature relief. ""Is that what it\'s called? Like, instead of \'cologne\', or \'eu de whatever\' it\'s called \'fragrance\'?""\n\n""Nah man, it\'s perfume. It\'s like \'women\'s perfume\'. And thanks man! I like it 2, lol, that\'s why I wear it.""\n\nHe was so happy and relieved (real this time, lol) that I was so totally dgaf about it. ""Wow, ok man, yeah that makes sense then! MAN! That smells so good!"" he says... then he looks at me and says ""I\'m not trying 2 be weird, man, but can I..."" \n\n""Of course, brother ❤""  I open my arms up and wave him in and, sure as s**t, he leans in and smells my chest lmao 😂 \n\n***CLARIFICATION/DISCLAIMER #2: I\'m 6\'+ and semi-athletic. My 1st career (a ""past life"" to be melodramatic, lol) was an inherently martial one. I am terribly good at reading people via both training and natural intuition. I was in no danger, regardless of how accurate I was about his real intentions. So many creeps and a**holes do similar things to people in a predatory way. I don\'t ""get afraid"" in situations like that and it\'s not Privilege I\'m proud of 💔😔 however, this story is meant to be fun and uplifting - one that shows how kindness between 2 people is so cool when someone corrects their thinking for the better mid-convo  like my man in this tale ❤❤❤ END DISCLAIMER***\n\n""Damn that smells good!!! Where\'d u get it?"" He realizes he\'s way more excited and intimately engaged with a stranger than any normal circumstance would justify but at the same time felt safe that could compliment me and discuss \'perfume\' ☺\n\n""Nordstrom... and it better smell good 4 what I paid 4 it"" we laughed 2gether it was awesome ❤\n\nHe said, ""I swear I\'m not trying 2 hit on u or anything, but can... I...""\n\n""C\'mon, yeah, bring it in..."" he smelled my shirt again, like deep lol 😂 \n\nI made him write it down. I told him he\'d get 100 yards out of the parking lot and forget so he did. \n\nCool cat, that dude. I hope he was legit that cool with folks like us or, better, he wasn\'t but is now 👍🌈\n\nOh, then the sweet old lady behind me when dude left...

5 years ago I went through a sexuality crisis, I was 18 and had a very supportive girlfriend. Probably too supportive as every other week I was saying I was only attracted to men then changing my mind. It took a year to find the term pansexual and feel comfortable applying it to me. Now I'm questioning my gender identity. I am very comfortable in my male body but I feel my energy is much more feminine and I think I would feel comfortable (maybe more so) in 'female' clothes and being treated as ""one of the girls"". I have a very support girlfriend and I'm prepared for a tough period ahead. For now I'm just looking for advice about how to start this journey and the best place to find people who would be happy to talk about it and help me through it.

2019-04-30 01:01:30,bix7sz,12,3,"Hi!

So, I'm trying to come up with an alternate username, but I also think it could be an actual alternate/additional name. I don't see it necessarily as changing my name - my given name will always be one of my names - but adding names. 

But I keep overthinking it. 

One idea that came to me is that I have always really liked cat tails. When I was little my mom would pick one for me, and I'd play with it. I loved the texture  of the seeds all tightly packed together. 

So I looked up the latin word for cattail and it's Typha (pronounced TIE-phuh, more or less). I thought that might be cool as a name, but the 'a' ending makes it sound more feminine than I'm going for. Maybe as a middle name instead. Then I doubt myself because I think, why latin? Isn't that kind of Eurocentric? But I'm not sure what other language I would use. 

I kinda want to ask my mom what she would have named me if I was a boy, even though I'm not trans masc, but as a jumping off point. I like gender neutral names like Jamie. And any name can be gender neutral, but it all depends on perceptions. 

I'd like to have a name that  says something about my personality, kinda like in Tailchaser's Song (link below). But my personality changes so much that that is hard to pin down.

And any name can be gender neutral, but it all depends on perceptions. \n\nI'd like to have a name that  says something about my personality, kinda like in Tailchaser's Song (link below). But my personality changes so much that that is hard to pin down. \n\n[https://tailchaserssong.fandom.com/wiki/Naming](https://tailchaserssong.fandom.com/wiki/Naming)"", 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'Overthinking alternate names for myself.

I’ve been experimenting (very much in secret from all but my supportive wife) with clothes and makeup, and I’m planning to get laser to clean up my face, which has all been exciting and freeing. 

But I’m really mixed on hormones. When I’m feeling femme I REALLY want to start HRT, but when I’m feeling masc, going on hormones just sounds silly, if not an outright bad idea.

If you’re on hormones, how’d you decide to go for it, knowing your gender will continue to fluctuate and won’t always jive with the changes HRT gave you?",genderfluid,"If you’re on hormones, how’d you decide to start?",1556617198.0,"{'created_utc': 1556591998, 'id': 'biy6oj', 'num_comments': 7, 'score': 13, 'selftext': 'Hey all!

2019-04-30 03:09:52,biygzw,7,5,"Over the past weekend I had a pretty rough lurch. I'm AMAB and mostly non-binary, and only really recently started understanding that I'm genderfluid. I've been getting increasingly comfortable with being a woman and was building up a lot of excitement for future possibilities, until one night I just sort of looked up and was very much a man, all with no warning or perceptible shift.

Anyways I was pretty stunned and disconcerted over it, and spent a couple days just trying to work through it all. At first I felt like it was just the shock and disappointment or whatever, but I found there was more going on. I had a very unstable childhood and learned to only rely on myself for certainty, safety, and stability. Nobody else ever provided it, so it was just me. I had started to see my gender as something I also trusted myself for - a stability and identity rooted in *me*. So when that changed, suddenly, it felt like a betrayal. Except instead of someone else failing me, *I* was failing me.

I like to write, especially when I have emotions to process, so I scribbled out some thoughts about it. I don't have a real answer to any of it, and I can only hope that I can weather the inevitable next change a little more easily... but I did produce a note for myself, a kind of reminder for whenever I need it. I wanted to share it in case it can help someone else, and maybe to hear about how you all handle the feelings of not knowing who you might wake up as.

&gt; Hi. I need you to understand something. I know that you are the one that needs to hear this, even if I don't know exactly what to call you. Even if **you** don't know what to call you. No matter who's there, no matter what has happened, no matter where life is going, **I love you.** Nothing can ever, ever change that.

&gt; I love you forever. I love Amelia, and I love whoever else the world may see, or who they never can. I love you because you deserve to be loved, and you deserve to have something that can always be trusted - something from inside. You can always trust that you deserve to be loved. And you can always trust that I love you.
