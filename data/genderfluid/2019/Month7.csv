2019-07-01 04:55:48,c7ocbc,5,40,"It's taken me a while to figure out what I am.  Part of it is my general disdain for labels, but a lot of it was buried for so long.

I was born male and identified that way until very recently, but the development was a while coming.  I'd done a couple of sex games with my first wife that involved me wearing her panties in public as a turn on; we both thought it'd be funny and hot to ""get away with it"", and it helped that we were the same size, but I felt really good in them... not aroused as such, but it found a place in me that I didn't know needed touched.  After doing that with her a couple of times, I thought about asking to do it again (didn't even occur to me to just take a pair of her panties and wear them anyway) but the marriage was disintegrating and it didn't happen.

Fast forward to five years ago.  I was driving home from being out with friends and I had this urge to go right then and get some panties.  So I did.  I outed myself a few weeks later to my (second) wife, who didn't care for the idea of her husband in lingerie.  (I think there's a difference between general underwear and lingerie; she doesn't.)  So I hid it from her.  I didn't tell her that I'd added bras.  Or that a couple of years after that I'd started painting my toenails, shaving my legs nine months of the year, and wearing pantyhose.  (We lived in Trumplandia.  The general populace wouldn't have taken to a man with shaved legs, so I didn't do it in summer until this year.  Same with the toenails.)

It didn't go any further until six weeks ago, and I started wondering, ""What if you tried wearing a blouse?""  Did the math on my size, went to Walmart to try something on to verify it.  I had my son with me (he's six and autistic, so... nonjudgmental).  I took him and a couple of sizes of the same blouse, short sleeves with ruffles on the sleeves, and tried one.  He looked at me and said, ""You're beautiful!""  He was right.

I ordered a skirt... a few more blouses... a dress... three pairs of shoes.  I bought a curling wand (my hair is long enough that I can do that).  A month ago I tried on a full outfit late one night while everyone else was asleep.  I nearly cried I was so happy.  I added makeup, and a few weeks later presented as female for the first time to my therapist.  I felt like I'd found myself at last.  When I was twice called Miss last Wednesday I was giddy.

I feel beautiful, worthy, and desirable for the first time in my life... and very much alone.  My wife doesn't know, and I don't know how to tell her.  A few select close friends know, but that's it.  I don't feel the need to present as female every day, but having the space to do that would be welcome.

Non-binary/Genderfluid, I finally have a word for how I feel, for years I've been confused by the fact that I really like 3 piece suits and cocktail dresses; for a long time I thought I might be gay but then I met my wife and I discovered that wasn't the case, then I thought maybe I like cross dressing but it didn't feel like enough to just put the clothes on I wanted to look like the woman underneath.    



Thank god for the Reddit, a random post about another AMAB who had the same experience as me was like a lightbulb going off in my head, a terrifying lightbulb that could potentially improve or ruin my life. I spend most of the rest of the day reading into non-binary and other people experiences.    





\*\*Day 2: Sunday\*\*    



Anxiety, so much anxiety, between emails from work that I have to deal with on Monday and not having any clue how to tell my wife I ended up walking the dog repeatedly way more than normal until my wife actually questioned why I was going for yet another walk (on a side note it was the dog's best ever weekend).    



I spent most of the day in what felt like an outer body experience simultaneously excited and terrified. On my final walk of the day I ended up breaking down to my friend and telling her everything, I need someone neutral who I knew cared about me but also wouldn't ruin my life if they rejected me. Fortunately, she was amazing and was super excited for me and gave me loads of tips on coming out to my wife.    





\*\*Day 3: Monday\*\*    



Work was hell but too be honest I barely noticed anything other than the clock slowly ticking by, I'd resolved to tell my wife that evening because I didn't want to hide anything from her.    



Finally, I reached zero hour, the kids were asleep, I got my wife a glass of wine and started the conversation ""there's something we need to talk about, it's nothing anyone's done wrong, but I have to address it..."" I spoke nearly continuously for about thirty minutes and poured my heart about how I felt, how I'd felt this way for a long time but never had any words to be able to articulate the feelings and that I didn't even know there was a term for how I felt until Saturday.    



I stopped talking took a breath and asked her how she felt about it, she was incredibly supportive for somebody who's just had an anvil of information dropped on them, I gave her the option to leave, I told her that although I needed to find out who I was inside I would only do it with her and if she was uncomfortable I'd rather be miserable with her than totally devastated without her. My wife told me to stop being stupid, she had no intention of leaving me and although it was a shock she understood as best she could and would do whatever she needed to help me.    



The rest of the evening is kind of a blur, I gave my wife a bit of space and took the dog for a longer walk so she could have some time to process everything, when I got back we just sat, ate chinese takeaway and cracked a few jokes at the predicament, it was the best outcome I could have hoped for.    





\*\*Day 4 &amp; 5: Tuesday/Wednesday\*\*    



I'm lumping these two days together since they were basically the same, huge surges of euphoria followed by periods of anxiety. I had resolved to take things reasonably slow so my wife wouldn't be uncomfortable but I did push the boundaries on Wednesday evening by looking at dresses with her just to see how she would react (my concern was she was still in a state of denial), she was super excited about the idea of going cloth shopping together which was a positive boost for the evening.    



\*\*Day 6: Thursday\*\*    



Utter crippling anxiety, I dressed in pretty much a full suit today and hid within my male half's comfort zone feeling like an imposter and wondering if I'd done the right thing saying anything to my wife. There were points where I felt completely disconnected from the genderfluid feeling I'd felt over the last five days and I began to psyche myself out thinking that made it was all hormones or a fever. I got home from work and basically crashed for an hour before comfort eating but by the end of the evening I'd started to feel like a human again.    



\*\*Day 7: Friday\*\*    



Started the day feeling anxious which I believe was a holdover from Thursday but as the day went on I began to feel more confident in my previous assertions. Spent the evening looking at clothes and bits with my wife and purchased two dresses to arrive the following week, there's not a lot to say about Friday other than buying the clothes didn't feel wrong it felt like an extension of my inner person that I'd been trying to keep hidden away.    





N.B. I'm writing all this down because it's therapeutic for me to get the feelings out in words especially so I can re-read them later when I'm feeling low and remind myself of how I felt before, but I also hope it might encourage or support anyone else who's going through the same feelings of confusion, excitement and anxiety that I'm going through.

2019-07-02 15:46:51,c8at83,15,7,"I've rewritten this like 4 times to be less long and rambly but it's still terrible. I'm sorry. 

I've always considered myself a (mostly) straight cis woman. Sure I was a tomboy growing up and I'm still not ""girly"" but I've never been uncomfortable with being a woman. Even when I was 12 and dressed like a boy I corrected people who thought I was one, even though I actually liked the fact that I was androgynous enough for them to make the mistake.

I wear women’s jeans with men’s sneakers, men’s shirts with pushup bras. I never really thought about it beyond “men’s t-shirts and shoes are cooler” and it's never mattered. As an adult I don’t have a figure that anyone is likely to mistake for male anyway, regardless of how I dress.

My first D&amp;D character was male. No one else at the table was openly playing outside of their own gender so I figured I’d try something different. I make a lot of characters (many of which I’ll never get to play) about evenly split male and female. I do the same thing in video games, trying to keep a balance of male and female characters.

And then I made a changeling for D&amp;D. Changelings can change their appearance at will and have a pretty fluid relationship with gender so I debated the use of pronouns for the character and eventually decided that he’d mostly use “he” since he usually chooses to appear as a male (albeit androgynous) elf. That’s whatever, it hasn’t even come up in character because even though people know he’s not a normal elf they don’t know what he is.

But between that and people asking why I tend to make male characters it got me thinking. Every since I was a kid playing make believe, slipping in and out of male personas has always felt natural and it never occurred to me until recently that maybe it isn't natural or expected for everyone.

I have non-binary friends, people who use “they” pronouns because neither male or female feels right. But that’s not me: female is just fine. Hell, I mostly even like being a woman and I've never experienced dysphoria. It’s just that I'm realizing I think being male would also be fine.

I looked it up and discovered that non-binary includes genderfluid and that genderfluid can include being both male and female, rather than neither. So now I don’t know if I’m reading too much into this. I don’t know if the fact that pride month just ended and that my friend recently came out as non-binary is influencing this line of thought. And I don’t know if even it matters. Even if I settle on the idea of being genderfluid it doesn’t change anything. I’m not looking to change my name or pronouns or the way I present.

I know my husband wouldn’t reject me or anything, but I’m still hesitant to talk to him. What if this is nothing and I’m letting outside factors color my thinking? If I say it I can’t take it back so it feels like such a permanent decision, especially for someone like me who doesn’t really do feelings.

Basically, I was born a female and have been a female for 16 years. Obvious I went through the 'Ewww pink Ewww skirts! Hanging out with girls is bad! I only hang out with boys!' phase that every little girl goes through, but some days I wake up and I just.. feel wrong?

It's hard to explain exactly, but one day I was in the bathroom and I found some ace wrap under the cabinet and I was curious so I wrapped my chest (a big no-no, I know!) and I just, *liked* how I looked with a flat chest. It made me feel *good*.

And recently I cut my hair SUPER short like, it's a pixie shave and some times I look in the mirror and it reminds me so much of a guys haircut and I like that. Sometimes in the early mornings, I sit in front of my mirror and I just kinda sit shirtless and I feel gross about my boobs and how small they are and then I wrap and I feel better, like it feels right to have a flat chest.

But other days I wake up and I'm like, 'hell ya I'm a chick and I fucking love girls' and other days I want to make myself look like a guy and I want my boobs to disappear and I just feel like I've been stuck in the wrong body.

In fact my wife was the one who said that she thought I was, which led to me researching and coming to he same realisation. My main worry was coming out to my friends.

&amp;#x200B;

I think a bit of back story is needed first before I go into my coming out. I stream on Twitch (like a tonne of other people these days) and up until recently I was the owner of a mighty beard. I would frequently get compliments on it from viewers. I know having a beard isn't a symbol of masculinity but to me it symbolised one, so I trimmed it back and then yesterday shaved it off completely. Now I consider a lot of my regular viewers my friends, even though we have never (and may never) meet in real life, they are my friends. The person I consider my best friend lives in England and we usually only converse through facebook. But nevertheless the thought of coming out to them scared me, even though my wife reassured me that it would be fine.

&amp;#x200B;

So yesterday was my 37th birthday and I had planned a big night of games and fun, beginning with me coming out to my friends. I had bought makeup (which I need to practice with), I bought a new dress, and I even dyed my hair like I had been wanting to for ages. I had everything set up and ready to go, and let me tell you I was shaking. My legs were twitching, I had to hold onto the desk to stop my hands shaking. But I worried for nothing. My friends accepted me as who I am. I was soo happy that I nearly broke down in tears (remembering it has me welling up again), my wife even instructed me on the right way to wipe away my tears so I didn't ruin my makeup. I think my friends were more shocked at seeing my sans beard than with makeup on. I couldn't stop thanking them at the end and today there was a group of people who I didn't thank. 

&amp;#x200B;

It was all of **YOU**! I have been reading all of your posts and seeing your pictures, and it gave me the confidence to stand up on camera and say to my friends that I was genderfluid.

Now I consider a lot of my regular viewers my friends, even though we have never (and may never) meet in real life, they are my friends. The person I consider my best friend lives in England and we usually only converse through facebook. But nevertheless the thought of coming out to them scared me, even though my wife reassured me that it would be fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo yesterday was my 37th birthday and I had planned a big night of games and fun, beginning with me coming out to my friends. I had bought makeup (which I need to practice with), I bought a new dress, and I even dyed my hair like I had been wanting to for ages. I had everything set up and ready to go, and let me tell you I was shaking. My legs were twitching, I had to hold onto the desk to stop my hands shaking. But I worried for nothing. My friends accepted me as who I am. I was soo happy that I nearly broke down in tears (remembering it has me welling up again), my wife even instructed me on the right way to wipe away my tears so I didn't ruin my makeup. I think my friends were more shocked at seeing my sans beard than with makeup on. I couldn't stop thanking them at the end and today there was a group of people who I didn't thank. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was all of **YOU**! I have been reading all of your posts and seeing your pictures, and it gave me the confidence to stand up on camera and say to my friends that I was genderfluid. So to each and every one of you gorgeous people, from the bottom of my heart, **THANK YOU** and I love you all!"", 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'I did it!

2019-07-15 02:58:45,cdc1ov,1,2,"Hi. Um. I don't really know how to start this beyond saying I think I might be gender fluid?

Some context. I'm 21 and asexual. I'm happy with that part of me, but gender has always been... Weird. I remember dressing up in my Mum's clothes when I was a small child, then stopping for a while, then doing it secretly again right at the end of high school. I've also always toyed with the idea of being a girl. In video games I often play female characters, I've always gotten on better with female friends, I've often dreamed about being female (as in actual sleeping dreams). Many of my female friends have even told me that I've never seemed ""male"" to them, I'm just * my name *. 

Recently I've felt a serious urge to wear bras again. I've always liked the way they feel, sort of reassuring in a way. I love looking at dresses and wearing leggings. I've been talking with a friend of mine about this and I've established that some days I feel like wearing dresses and some days I feel like wearing chainmail. Some days I wake up feeling dressy and as the day goes on I feel more chainmail and vice versa.

I've also started to deal with some serious dysphoria over my genitalia. I don't like it, I don't like that it's there, I don't like that it does the things it does. I'm asexual and sex repulsed so it's not like I'll ever use them.

2019-07-15 20:17:27,cdmu75,3,5,"I always felt like a cis guy for so many years, even now to some extant. I grew up in a predominately white cishet community, and there were certain expectations for gender roles and how boys and girls were supposed to behave. I never really had any opportunities to explore non-masc identity, but most of the time I didn’t care because I enjoyed being a guy.


However, ever since spending more time with my partner and experiences I had on psychedelics, I’ve become more questioning towards my gender. Basically, on shrooms and DMT I felt very femme, dressed in femme clothes, behaved femme, and a lot of it came naturally or at least felt unforced, to the point that I’d forget to switch out of my fish voice while on the phone with my original high school friends; I didn’t feel any attachment to my old self, and got to explore being new people and identities. I also noticed trends in my behavior, like my comfort and preference to having female friends instead of males in college, as well as wearing some of my moms clothes as a child, watching a lot of girl-centered tv shows as a kid, etc. Of course this can also mean absolutely nothing, but I could tell that I was less masc as I am now when I was a child. 

Since then though, I feel like I’ve become more distant towards my femme side. I love the thought of being femme, doing cute makeup, wearing femme clothes, and have even pleasantly imagined being a mother, but sometimes I try to think and feel more femme and it feels exhausting and stressful rather than natural. Like I want to be more femme and get more in touch with that part of myself, but my mind and body feels masc. There are times where if I’m in the shower and concentrate hard enough, I see my body differently, and it helps me feel much more femme and in touch with my femme side. However, it makes me anxious that I’m merely pretending to be gender fluid or femme for the sake of validating this identity I claim to have, to both make me happy and to also make my partner happy (they had reservations about seeing a cishet guy originally, now after I’ve explored myself more and spent more time with them, they are much less anxious) even though at this point they wouldn’t care what gender I am. 

I can’t tell if I’m forcing this, or perhaps I’m making it more difficult by setting expectations and comparing my identity to other NB/GF people, trying to think and behave how I’d have expected to originally as an outsider to the queer community. I have a lot of anxiety regarding my gender, as well as how my family would feel if I came out (they already have expressed dissatisfaction with the fact I’m seeing a trans guy). 

If I had to describe how I feel, I’d say like a shattered mirror, with different pieces arranged in the wrong and confusing places, making it difficult to understand what I am.

Forgive   me for thinking outside the box on this one, but I personally want to   be transgendered.  I think some of the most beautiful people on this   earth are individuals who are a mixture of both genders.  In a weird way   I think it is the best of both worlds or having all the toys.   Is  that  greedy of me?  I mean my sexuality is towards women.  I think  women are  absolutely art in motion.  I could also find myself attracted  to  another mtf transgender, but I find guys a bit repulsive and hairy.

So   yea, I think girls with a penis are hot.  I want to be one of them.    I'm also not offended or put off by terms like transsexual, or trans, or   tranny, new half, two spirit, or whatever else anyone wants to label   me.  I see alot of trans girls in different sections of reddit that post   pics of themselves in transition, so obviously they are happy with  what  they have.   Is that a bad thing?  I know it's different for  everyone,  but my dysphoria is not around my genitals and to be  perfectly honest, I  love vagina, but genitals male or female, really  neither one are all  that attractive when you get down to it, they look a  little alien or  messed up either way.  So I'm not really concerned at  all with what  hangs down below or doesn't.  My main focus has always  been on outward  appearance, body curves, breasts, hips, thighs, eyes,  those are the  things that make a beautiful woman.  People might wear  pussy hats now  days but I've never really wanted to just sit around and  stair at one.

Is  it wrong to  want and desire to be trans?  I mean if I could wave a  magic wand yea, I  would prefer to be female, but I've seen what they do,  and I am less  than impressed, and don't wish to have the maintenance of  a man made  vagina.  Dilation, surgeries, pain, upkeep, no thank you.

I still identify as female on the inside, but I think transgender girls are female, just with a little something extra, a bonus!

I  still want to pass when I'm done transitioning, but I'm not  uncomfortable with always having a little something special or extra  down below either.  I actually enjoy my sexuality and enjoy using what I  have.  I've always been one to accept my circumstances and try to deal  with them and have realistic expectations for the outcome.  so....

am I the crazy one for enjoying being trans?

I  will admit from time to time being in transition, being clocked, or  misgendered or whatever is not fun, that is not what I'm talking about.

2019-07-20 04:05:37,cfhk2c,10,45,"For all but a few minutes of the last three days, my feminine side was dominating.  (AMAB, save you the wondering.)  ""Dominating"" understates it; I was a woman.

Wednesday found me out in the world as my feminine side for eight hours.  I dropped my son off at his therapy... I've already outed myself there, but they hadn't yet seen me present as fully female.  Actually, apart from my therapist, no one that knows me had seen me present as fully female in person.  So that was terrifying... and uneventful.  I took him in, handed him off, and left, just like every other day.

From there, I found a quiet place on the campus I teach at and worked.  God bless telecommuting.  I was supposed to have therapy, but when you therapist gets last minute jury duty, the schedule goes astray.  I promised the wife take-away for dinner but they didn't open until 4, so I repaired to a bagel shop, where they treated me fine as a good place of business would, and then to Starbucks where the barista botched my name.  (I answer to a different name when I present female.)  But those were the first times I'd gone into a place of business presenting that way and it went fine.  I had to change before I got home (still haven't told the wife, tabled for the time being), but I was so excited, exhilarated, happy that the clothes didn't matter.  I was a woman.

Thursday was the same.  Worked at home in some non-descript clothes (tee-shirt and yoga pants, gotta love it), then a meeting at my son's therapy, then my own rescheduled therapy... blouse and shorts and ballet flats while I was out.  Didn't feel like messing with makeup two days running but then a lot of women don't.

Today I was still identifying female and kind of freaking a little; it's never lasted so long in one stretch before.  I wanted to throw something different on at home but couldn't... that frustrated me too.  There was something at the zoo tonight for special needs children and their immediate families, so I took my son.  Transferred into a blouse that was... more translucent than I thought it was, but that was secondary to the sweat; 90 degrees in the shade, perspiration will happen.  But my son... he doesn't see the clothes or the gender identity, he sees the person.  He sees Daddy.  And while I'm sure I got some second looks and some stares, the longer I was in the world, the less I cared.

And then, on the drive home, the woman in me put her head on my shoulder and slept.  I was back to what feels like my default setting these days (somewhere between the two, but more me than her), but the love I'm still feeling... the pleasure... the confidence... all of that will power me for days.

19/AMAB here, I've recently discovered that I'm genderfluid. I personally see myself as femboy/androgynous, and I'm interested in crossdressing. My pronouns are he/his and they/them.

I have a mustache, goatee, sideburns, and soul patch. My facial hair grows back quickly but has a very short maximum length. (I'm Asian, if that makes a difference.) My facial hair is black, but my skin is a light tan, so my facial hair shadow stands out very strongly. My mustache shadow also seems to be much darker than my goatee, soul patch, and sideburn shadows. As you can see, my facial hair grows in patches rather than a continuous beard or stubble. My soul patch doesn't connect to my goatee, unlike most AMAB people.

On the one hand, I want to hide my facial hair when presenting femme. /r/crossdressing seems to recommend using orange lipstick or color corrector on facial hair shadow, then going over with foundation. Any specific tips?

On the other hand, I want to grow out a van Dyke beard if possible. (think Colonel Sanders, Robert Downey Jr, Green Arrow) Is that possible with my current facial hair layout?

I'm super confused about how I want to present my gender. I don't know if I should keep my facial hair as is or get it removed. What should I do?

2019-07-23 21:05:33,cgyhdq,2,6,"I know I posted this on r/relationships but you guys are really good at giving advice so here it is. 

I accidentally got myself involved in a relationship problem between my best friend and their boyfriend and, being someone who has no relationship experience in my life, I don’t know what to do or how to help. 

My friend (R), who’s biologically a male, has told me they identified as gender fluid and wants to go for an androgynous look, but their boyfriend (M) isn’t comfortable with that, so their gender and desire to go androgynous was kept a secret for the longest time. A few nights ago they finally built up the courage to tell M, and as much as M is proud of R’s courage in coming out, he’s only attracted to guys, not non-binary people. He could respect it platonically, but this isn’t something he’ll fall for. 

After hearing the news he’s been rapidly losing romantic/sexual attraction and both of us are unsure what to do. They still love each other but it’s one-sided romantic/sexual wise now and I’m not sure how to fix it. M’s giving R’s androgynous look a try but both M and me are already losing hope this relationship would last if we keep this up. The two of them are in the same friend group as well and if they do break up M says he’ll get reminded of their relationship, so one of them has to leave. 

I’m keeping all what M told me a secret to R but I doubt anything we do would make things better. R understands it would take time for M to get used to and so do I but I didn’t think this would happen. I didn’t expect him to lose attraction and having breakdowns. The things R would like to change for an androgynous look are things M was attracted to and I don’t know how to compromise. But I shouldn’t let this relationship fall apart this quickly.

2019-07-26 04:46:30,chyfex,0,2,"First time posting about gender feels online so please let me know if I misstep and how I can do better.

I am in my mid 30s and came out to myself slowly for years, then finally all at once when I came out to my spouse (all amazingly supportive on that front). The problem is, my mother in law is getting remarried super soon and I am not out to her. I am so grateful to have found some language to describe my experience but dont know anyone else who identifies as anything in this corner of the rainbow and my spouse is nothing but supportive but we are learning together.

I am in the bridal party and I really do want to be supportive and do not want to make any of her special moments about me by having any panic attacks brought on by dysphoria or drama.

I spend most of my time in what I am currently calling ""other"" gender, since it falls outside the binary but often is mixed with a flavor of masc. I tend to lean towards male more than female. But that can change in a few moments or maybe not until days or weeks. Super unpredictable. 

My female feels have been super scarce lately and, just when I thought she might might be showing up, I shaved my legs and was caught off guard by the following dysphoria and panic attack. (I know shaving is not a gendered activity but nevertheless, my hairless thighs made me super dysphoric) Now she is nowhere to be found and I think I was trying to force a female switch or something... it would make the wedding situation so much easier.

Every time someone genders me as female, lately, it's like a gut punch and I live somewhere that everyone uses ""ma'am"" and ""sir"" so it keeps happening.

I am super stressed by the huge amount of gendered language my MIL has been using about the event. And a ton of it has been directed at me as she tries to make me feel included and special. I appreciate the sentiment but just typing it is freaking me out. There will be even more of that talk on the day and I am trying to figure out how to get away with no makeup if necessary. 

Does anyone have any survival tips on how to get through this intact other than crossing my fingers and hoping I flow into female for the big day?

Any help is appreciated. Or even just knowing that I am not overreacting.

I’m AMAB but was very feminine growing up. Came out as gay at 13 and only attracted to men. So always just known as a really effeminate gay man. In my late teens and early 20s I was called androgynous by everyone. I had long hair, shaved all my body hair, wore makeup, mixed men’s and women’s clothes and painted my nails. I was often mistaken for a woman. I did drag and performed in drag shows. I just thought of myself has a gay man who did drag.

While I had a close friend who was MTF and had the full surgery, it wasn’t anything I ever considered. So didn’t see myself as trans

One day I put all that aside because I thought the only way I’d find love was to present as a more masculine gay man. I’ve been married to a man for many years now. I stifled my feminine side.

But the past two to three years I’m realizing I miss that side. So sorry vet been expressing it more, like wearing pink more, etc. I know that color has no gender but it’s an example of how I’ve started owning my more feminine side.

Although I present as a man, although a feminine gay man (in fact a gay worker called me too gay to function) I do have moments where I feel more feminine. For instance if I’m going about my day, even in routine tasks, in my mind I feel as if I’m a woman doing these things and having these experiences.

**Study Information:**

This is a qualitative study that will examine the attitudes and experiences of non-binary, gender nonconforming, and genderqueer parents. The research will answer the question: how do GNC individuals transition into parenthood, and how to they share the roles and responsibilities of parenting?

Sociologists have extensively studied parenting and gender inequality in home. Moreover, literature has positioned the differentiation of motherhood and fatherhood as a driver of the gender binary. However, this research has focused primarily on cisgender and heterosexual parents or gay/lesbian parents. Non-binary, gender nonconforming, and genderqueer individuals remain a population of parents that social science research has ignored. This work will fill this gap. By studying the attitudes and experiences of individuals who do not identify as strictly male or female, this work will contribute to a greater sociological understanding of gender, parenting, and the binary.",genderfluid,Harvard GNC Parent Study,1564445921.0,"{'created_utc': 1564420721, 'id': 'cje9w8', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 4, 'selftext': '&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/02x0tcyf0ad31.jpg\n\n**Study Information:**\n\nThis is a qualitative study that will examine the attitudes and experiences of non-binary, gender nonconforming, and genderqueer parents.

2019-07-30 01:41:35,cjku28,6,4,"Hi, so basically maybe a little backstory before I get into the nitty and gritty. Basically I was born female and identified as female most of my life, well in reality I never questioned my gender identity as a younger child so I just let it be. At the age of around 15, I came out as bi to myself and my closest friends, I only really felt comfortable talking about my sexuality with my family a year ago since even though they claim to be liberal, my sister is the only one who has been unconditionally supportive of me, my parents and my other siblings confuse me with their attitudes... and to be honest accepting my own sexuality took me way longer than I actually thought it would. Sometime in the middle of 2018 my gender expression started to change from fairly feminine to androgynous, and then by the end of the year I started to question my gender altogether. Months pass and I realise I’m gender fluid. So there’s that to the backstory. 

Anyways, I’m almost 19 now and most days I can’t really tell what gender I feel, my gender usually showcases through my gender expression, because clothes that aren’t in line with the way I’m feeling just make me feel like crap. Recently the same thing has started happening with my body. I’m quite heavily chested, and in days that I feel very masculin I’ve started to experience gender dysmorphia. Along with that, over the past 3/4 weeks the thought of having a penis keeps popping into my head, it’s almost like a pure desire, and my mind starts wondering whether transitioning is what I actually want. And then I realise that given how fast I fluctuate between male, female and non-binary, changing my body wouldn’t be smart. Regardless of that, I’m having a really hard time figuring this out and I feel like it’s really starting to take a toll on me. I don’t really have anyone I can talk to about this. I don’t have any friends who are trans, more so genderfluid, and I know my cis friends would just look at me weird if I told them about this. Then there’s my girlfriend, who doesn’t consider herself a female and hasn’t really labelled her gender, she just knows she’s not female. She does identify as a lesbian though. I have told her about all of this gender stuff, even the dick stuff, and she’s been nothing but amazingly supportive about it, and yet I feel like on one hand the whole dick thing might be too much. Like, recently I’ve thought about strap ons and thought that maybe trying that would kind of help me explore the penis thing, but when I asked her on her take on it she said she isn’t too keen on it (to be fair I never specified us trying it which could also play a role in her attitude) but she has told me on several occasions that she’s repulsed by dicks, their shape and everything about them, which I understand since she just simply isn’t attracted to men, at least anatomically. 

I’m sorry if this doesn’t make sense... it’s a lot of thoughts crammed into one text. I guess what I’m trying to ask for is just a little help. I just want to know how to manoeuvre about this whole thing. It’s so much tougher than I’d ever expected it to be.

Background info: I'm a 19/AMAB Asian-American with extremely transphobic parents. I'm a college student financially dependent on them and I can't move out for the next 3 years.

Ever since I hit puberty, I've wanted to present more femme. I currently keep my hair cut really short (mostly because my parents make me get frequent haircuts, partly because I kinda like the feeling of short hair). For the near future, it looks like I'm stuck with short hair

I don't know what to do with my hair in the long run (i.e. after the next 3 years). I'm okay with either a clean-shaven face or a van Dyke beard. This is my first time growing out a van Dyke, so I don't know how long it'll get or how it'll look on me.

* On the one hand, it's been a childhood dream of mine to get a buzz cut and a crew cut (military-style haircut? idk). I am somewhat interested in presenting as a butch woman (e.g. Ellen DeGeneres) or effeminate man with short hair. (would it make sense to shave my body and leg hair or let it grow out?)

* On the other hand, I've also wanted to grow my hair long and be a conventional femme woman ever since puberty. I also want to be a long-haired guy (e.g. Loki or Thor from Marvel) or a femboy/drag queen (e.g. James from Pokemon). I could also style my hair in more creative ways if it's long, and shampoo and conditioner seem to be working okay on my current short hair. The problem is, I don't know how to take care of long hair, put it up in a ponytail or bun, deal with it, etc.

My hair grows rather slowly (2 inches in 3 months I think?) so it would take a long time for me to grow it out to a significant length. I also have a mercurial/impulsive/impatient personality so I might end up cutting my hair on a whim while growing it out, which would completely destroy years of progress.

On some days, I wish I had short hair, on other days I wish I had long hair. And on yet other days I wish I had androgynous-length hair (e.g. a bob or a mop). I could just keep my natural hair short and wear different wigs corresponding to my desired hair length, but at some point in my life I want to have naturally long hair.
