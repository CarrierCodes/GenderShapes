2019-06-03 22:11:12,bwgsig,2,8,"Hello everyone, I just wanted to lay out my situation and am curious about opinions. Sorry this will probably be very long because I want to get everything out there. I'm currently thinking about seeing a counselor because I've been feeling kinda confused lately. I've always been interested in CD/sissy porn since I was a tween, the latter of which I know this community finds disrespectful. I believe it to be a fetish currently and previously, but crossdressing is a little bit more than just that I feel since it's more of a lifestyle. This has always been the porn that has fascinated me the most, I like the feminization aspects of it and the idea of transformation. I've just always found the idea of being able to switch back and forth between genders to be really hot and fun. I remember when my mom told me that I was a boy and I was disappointed because I wanted to be like her. She was my idol and my dad wasn't as emotionally in touch with us as children. However, I never had much of a problem being a boy and I did boy things and enjoyed them. I can't say I really wanted to do girly things growing up or be a girl but I do remember one time my sister and her friend put some jewelry on me with a game they were playing. 

So fast forward to now and I am finally living alone. I've always had urges to crossdress and I finally cracked and started exploring that about a month ago or so. I find it really fun and like how it feels. However I start to feel kinda stressed and worried if I do it for long periods, like dressing up all day at home. I'm not sure if the stress is dysphoria or just feeling like I need to spend more time as a guy because I've been overindulging quite a bit since I've started. The main source of conflict I feel for me is that I've been jealous of girls in how they are able to be vulnerable, talk about anything with their friends, generally have more social support, get to wear sexy outfits, and generally have an easier go of it at dating and sex. I still haven't had sex or a gf and that's been a big source of angst and frustration. I'm fairly passive and have always had trouble approaching and leading girls. Perhaps it will get better with practice but I'm still in my mid twenties and still don't feel comfortable. I do feel like it'd be easier to be a girl in that way and socially, and my dating and social life are my biggest sources of frustration and I know they'd give me the most happiness. 

Just recently I went on a trip with family and my mom and sister used that gender swap feature on snapchat, and it seemed to really intrigue my mom how she looked as a man and my sister didn't like herself as a man. When they saw what I looked like as a girl my mom said I looked pretty and my sister said I couldn't make a prettier girl than her after she saw my picture. Since I've started crossdressing and getting into sissy stuff I feel like it's escalated fairly quickly, probably because I've held it in for so many years. I ended up trying some things I thought I never would do even a couple months ago. I tried a little makeup and made a grindr and am considering experimenting with other CDs and men so that I get to experience what it's like to 'have sex like a woman.' Which I know there is no universal way they have sex but just to see how it feels and so it validates my feminine side. I've never actually been interested in men before so that's what makes me feel like it's just a fetish. I'd like to see what it's like to go out to a LGBT bar dressed up because I think it'd be fun. I've also considered that I might be gender fluid. I've been getting a lot of attention on grindr and guys liking my pictures and thinking I look good. It definitely feels good to get attention in that way because typically most guys don't get that kind of attention from girls. 

I've also noticed that after I cum from masturbation the desire starts to go away, which further makes me think it's just a fetish. However, today I still ended up dressing. I just recently read about something called Nonhomosexual Autogynephilic Transsexualism and I can relate to the concept of autogynephilia but I'm not sure what this sub's opinion of it is and if it's a real thing. I never really thought I was trans growing up but I have considered it. I’ve actually considered making my body more fem more the time being, which is weird because I’ve always wanted to be muscular. 

Thanks for reading and sorry it's so long. I'm just concerned because lately I've been getting addicted to crossdressing and sissy stuff and I'm sure I have a porn addiction, but I believe the desires will always be there. I'd just like a relationship with a girl but I doubt she'd be ok with this side of myself unless she was bisexual possibly. If I do get deeper and deeper into this stuff, sleep with guys, and really enjoy the whole lifestyle I feel like it could lead to transitioning somehow possibly. But that would be like making your fetish your entire life if you didn't truly think you were a girl and I'm sure I'd regret it and I don't think I'd be able to deal with everything that goes into transitioning anyway.

2019-06-05 00:52:10,bwwiuo,12,2,"Hi everyone. I hope im not breaking any rules or bothering anyone by asking for some help. Sorry about my rambling!

I’m a female (14), and have been one ever since birth. Life’s been normal for me in terms of gender... until now that is.

For the past 4 days my gender has been... strange. I feel more masculine all of a sudden. I also still feel a bit feminine and it changes a lot through the day, somewhat adding a little stress to my life, which is normal because I have severe anxiety and literally anything can scare me, haha.

When I was younger, I did wonder what it was like as a boy. Hell I even wanted to turn into one for a day to see what it’s like. But I assumed this was normal behavior for kids my age and gender so I didn’t question it. It faded away and came back sometimes, but again, didn’t assume anything was wrong. I added this paragraph here just in case it helps.

Anyways, back to present day: I feel more masculine than feminine often. To be honest, I really do wanna be a guy. I wanna dress as one, look like one, and be called the pronouns. But at the same time I also wanna be a girl. My body feels wrong sometimes and it bothers me.

Now I do wanna put makeup on to look more masculine. I really do! Problem is my mom knows that I am not a fan of makeup. I have tried two times recently but I rushed because even though my mom was gone and probably wouldn’t walk in on me putting some on I still feared of when she’d come back. I want to put on the makeup and not be questioned about it, but as I’ve stated before: Mom knows I’m not a makeup fan. And she does not know that I’ve been struggling with my gender identity lately. (Or knows my sexuality either, which is pan/bi asexual if you were curious.) My family isn’t seriously religious or anything, it’s just anxiety.

So could you guys maybe help me with my gender crisis? I did originally ask on r/genderqueer but my post got deleted for some weird reason so I came to this sub next because I think I am genderfluid. Thank you for reading my ramble!

My parent revealed a few years ago that they are gender fluid! I love them immensely and I want to support them completely. My sister and I have been asking them each year what they feel most comfortable celebrating (Mothers day/Fathers day) and it has usually coincided with what they identify most with at the time. But this year I was thinking I surprise them with “Super Awesome Parent Day” just to show them how much I love them and appreciate them as a parent, not just reliant on gender. Should I surprise them or ask first to make sure they are comfortable? I’m thinking of making my own card and a present for it, and perhaps go kayaking and take them out to lunch.

My sister and I have been asking them each year what they feel most comfortable celebrating (Mothers day/Fathers day) and it has usually coincided with what they identify most with at the time. But this year I was thinking I surprise them with “Super Awesome Parent Day” just to show them how much I love them and appreciate them as a parent, not just reliant on gender. Should I surprise them or ask first to make sure they are comfortable? I’m thinking of making my own card and a present for it, and perhaps go kayaking and take them out to lunch.

2019-06-08 02:03:10,by2s8v,1,9,"So.. I used to make fun of gender-fluid people because I didn’t understand at all. I thought that doesn’t make sense whatsoever. My ex of a week ago said “maybe you’re gender-fluid OP.” I was confused. 

When I was about 4 years old I would tuck my penis in and be like “mommy look, I’m a girl!” My little sister wasn’t born yet. How the fuck would I know what a girls anatomy looks like? I would play house with my cousins but sometimes I would would want to be the girl dog (or whatever animal we were pretending to be) to give birth to the little ones. Weird. 

At around 12 I had to move into my grandads house with my mom and sister because my parents got a divorce. 

One day, I don’t know why, I had this idea “I wonder what a dress feels like!” So I put on a dress, stockings, heels.. It felt good. I used to run home from the bus so I could dress up. I knew it was wrong. I knew it wasn’t what boys should do. I did it anyway. 

One of the first orgasms I ever had was from acting like I was being bent over the bed and being fucked. Why the hell would I think that way? At 13? With no other sexual interaction whatsoever? That’s where it started. 

I would dress up every chance I got and then.. I just kinda stopped.. I saw some girls and I was like damn... They’re hot. I started dating girls and having a great time, completely disregarding what has been going on. 

I was having a great time and then there was a knock at the door. “Hey! You forget about me?” 

It was around 20 when that happened. I would only let that side out every now and then. In secret. 

The divide took place. I am now two people in one body. I am OP but there is also op. I am two separate identities in one. 

I don’t know if I’m gender fluid. I am not unhappy with my current body. I am not unhappy that I have a penis and enjoy fucking women but I do love the thought of being a woman and taking dick. 

I’m unsure. I think I’m genderfluid now because I’ve made two separate people in one body. Most days I feel masculine and some days I feel feminine.

I'm a biological girl (AFAB) but I've been questioning my gender a lot recently. For most of my life I was pretty certain that I was female, maybe because society just told me I was or something, but in the last few months I started to discover that there are more genders than just male/female and I started questioning whether I'm really cis or whether I might be genderqueer/non-binary.

Once I actually started thinking about it, I realised that I don't really have that many 'female' traits and that I do have quite a few 'male' traits. I often don't feel like I belong with other girls and prefer to be around guys/non-binary folk. But this fluctuates a lot - some days I'm more feminine and on other days I'm more of a guy. This led me to think that I might be genderfluid.

The main thing that throws me off though is that I don't really know what defines being male and what defines being female. I don't fit the stereotypes of a girl (I don't like make-up, shopping etc) but does that necessarily make me a not-girl? What if I'm just a girl with different interests and personnality traits? And the other thing is that most genderfluid people I've talked to on the internet say that they've felt that way since early childhood. For me, I was 100% certain that I was a girl for most of my life, but can't tell whether that's because of society and not knowing about other options or because I'm actually cis.

I dunno if it's just a phase that I'm going through or something or if I'm just overanalyzing my feelings...

2019-06-11 03:24:39,bz7e7i,11,42,"I'm AFAB and in my late 20s. I had identified as a lesbian for almost 12 years until last year. Last fall, a ton of suppressed dysphoria came up. It was intense. I had to come out, but didn't know what label to apply. I said I was genderfluid at the time. This sub helped me out a lot.

I'd had a few times before in which I felt distinctly masculine, dressed masc, and questioned my gender starting in my teens after coming out as lesbian, but dressed femme most of the time. Even in my femme phases though, I'd often fantasize about having an AMAB body or dying and reincarnating as a cis guy. My dream deep down was to be a cis guy who could express both masculinity and femininity and was emotionally integrated and free of toxic mindsets. (I'd long been repulsed by macho male egos.)

Those fantasies were a personal secret of mine until about last year. In fact, as far back as childhood, I recall feeling like I had a big ugly man inside me. I was really ashamed of my masculine energy because I was raised to see it as unacceptable and be super girly and cute. One of my intense subconscious fears was of it bursting out to the horror of other people. 

For most of my adult years, I felt very tight and uncomfortable in my skin. This I chalked up to trauma and aftereffects of meditation experiences. (Those were there too.) I felt like I wanted my conditioned identity to die for years often daily, especially in recent years. A huge amount of that weight was lifted as the suppressed dysphoria came up. It was a shock. Since then, I've been doing a lot of processing and integrating.

My gender hasn't fluctuated in the past eight months and probably won't. I do get times of feeling feminine energy or energy from my past identity, but I feel physically dysphoric around my breasts, vagina, etc. even then. At no time do I feel right in girly shirts or lacy underwear. I've felt consistently masc overall in my gender. 

Never once have I genuinely wanted to go back to living as a woman since. My past identity feels like something I need to release, not adopt again. I've consistently felt dysphoric around my legal name and she/her pronouns and have dreaded being seen as female in public. Even just calling myself nonbinary and just using they/them pronouns hasn't felt masculine enough.

I now call myself a guy and go by he/him or they/them. It feels really good! I started T three months ago, am loving the changes, and got euphoric over feeling like I truly saw myself for the first time in a recent picture! I want to legally change my name and gender marker from F to M. I also want top and eventually bottom surgery.

I’m AFaB (Assigned female at birth) and on the days when I feel like a guy, I want to embrace it. I want to dress like one and pass as one. However, as I’ve stated before, I’m in the closet. I do have a few clothes a guy would wear and a few unisex shirts, as well as a bunch of hoodies. Most of the stuff in my closet is more girly, which can be a struggle for me when I try to find something a bit more masculine to wear. I do wear hoodies a lot anyway, so that would probably help.

Now I would bind, but to be fair, I kinda have a flat chest already. I do use the double sports bra method (wear one normally, wear another one backwards on top) to help a bit more.

I have a hair appointment coming up as well, and I typically get my hair cut to around the bottom of my chin. I want to try and get a shorter hairstyle, but I don’t wanna be suspicious to my mom. (Although I did bring up “I might try getting my hair cut shorter” at the doctor’s office, and she asked  “Like a pixie cut?” and I shrugged.) I think it’d help me with my internal conflict.

Anyone have any tips? All help is appreciated!

2019-06-17 00:21:53,c1gzhv,8,7,"Hi there! Sorry in advance for the incoming wall of text.

For a long while now I have been looking over matters of identity and such. Trying to determine who, and what I am. I'm not talking months, I'm talking on and off for years now. 

A long time ago, I thought I felt more like a girl, but had no real thought behind why, I even bought a few dresses and other feminine things that I loved (never wore dress out, but would paint my nails). Fast forward a few years and I met a person who later discovered she was trans. She encouraged me to explore who I was, and to try and figure some stuff out, at least more so then I was. ((She heavily was pushing the 'you are trans like me' narrative though, partly because I think she didn't want to go through all of that alone.)) 

And for a while I tried thinking of myself as a woman, internally using more feminine nouns and terms. Had a name picked out and was generally feeling good about myself over all, even if I still didn't want to fully call myself a woman or start any sort of transition since it was still all sort of murky for me.

Then, at some point during it all, the thought of the feminine nouns and terms I was internally using didn't feel right, it almost made me feel sick. I would look in the mirror and think ""Beautiful doesn't fit, I am a lot more handsome"". Which just lead to even more confusion over all then when I had, at that time, started my whole quest for internal acceptance and understanding. 

Eventually the whole back and forth between feeling Masculine and Feminine became too much of a headache, and I decided that I am just me. People can call me whatever they like, and I largely didn't care for a good long while.

Then I read a post online from someone asking about gender, differances between certain things, etc etc. With one of the answers being to try thinking of yourself and how you feel as the opposite gender, if you opened your dresser and found specific female clothes, people called you by she and her, etc etc. The commenter said that thinking of the opposite gender of what they are didn't feel right for them, which is how they could tell they were male. It caused me to break down crying and going on a several hours long thought about the whole thing again. 

And largely, I don't know where I belong, so I want to revisit this topic and put the matter to rest finally. Several people say that gender fluid fits me best since I keep switching between feeling more of 1 or the other based upon the day. With no real set pattern involved. 

And, I want to learn. Hear stories about people who are genderfluid, how their daily lives tend to be, etc etc. Get some understanding that ""this could be normal"" or whatever. 

TLDR: Gender identity issues, want to learn more to determine if i am actually genderfluid through interactions and stories from others who are, and what that actually means for me in my day to day life if I am in fact genderfluid.",genderfluid,How does one go about learning if they are genderfluid?,1560756113.0,"{'created_utc': 1560730913, 'id': 'c1gzhv', 'num_comments': 8, 'score': 7, 'selftext': 'Hi there!

So I'll try to be clear and quick. I am a 20yo girl (french, sorry for the mistakes!), and never had problems with it, but since a few months I am starting to be wondering about my own body. I don't feel woman or man, i feel all this gender thing is completely stupid. But, on one hand, I love my face, my legs and my sex, but I just hate my breast and feel that they have nothing to do on my body, I would like to change that, I honestly don't bear them. 

Is it ""normal"" to only want to change one thing? did this happened to anyone else? or is it just some kind of 'crise' ?

So I'm genderfluid afab, and im just having a hard time even as a girl, dealing with my chest.

I do get top dysphoria like crazy when I'm identifying as male, but not really when I'm female... but I still don't really feel happy about my chest.

I think it's partially because when ever I've read something with genderfluid people/characters they have had top surgery or have a flat chest or talk about being female but not feeling the need/want for a chest.

All of which are valid opinions to have!

It just makes me feel like... maybe I shouldn't or can't be be genderfluid since i have a chest...

I have a binder, but top surgery is out of the question for me since I apparently have some uh strong negative reactions to the thought of surgery and it isn't healthy for me to even think about, but anyone I see who's genderfluid is either amab or afab with top surgery.

It just makes me feel like I'm not doing enough or I'm not good enough or I don't belong. I've been feeling that people would prefer with with surgery, that people would prefer me as a trans-male

I just,,, dont feel like I'm fully accepted within the LGBT community maybe...

idk i just want to like my chest, at least when im female

I've been considering a binary trans identity for a while now, but there are some differences I feel with my experience that makes it a little different from other binary trans accounts. 

My dysphoric or feminine-feeling periods tend to come in waves of a few months at a time. I'll feel very strongly feminine and freak out about transitioning for a few months, but the feelings eventually fade, and I'll spend a few months feeling more comfortable presenting as a guy, and then maybe the cycle repeats itself. 

I will say, I don't exactly feel non-binary. I've never really identified with the more... ambiguous(?) modes of presentation. Is a strictly binary gender fluidity a thing?

I am physically male and predominantly identify as male gendered. However I do sometimes slip into what feels like a female gender at times, more often when I'm at home alone with my girlfriend and am feeling a bit sassy or sweet or playful.

Lately I've felt a need to express this female side more. My gf bought me a silk robe, which totally helps, and sometimes she puts a headband on me. But I started thinking about making some kind of avatar of my female self.

So here's my queation: are there any good apps out there that anyone uses to create representations of yourselves in different genders? I'd love to have something on my phone I can look at and say ""this is me right now.""

2019-06-27 17:39:37,c68hz2,5,11,"I was born as a man, and grew up so. 

But something in the back of my mind has always given me this feeling that I’ve wanted to be female. But I don’t feel that all the time. 

I enjoy being male, for the most part, but something also makes me feel like I want to be female. I want to be able to dress more feminine, and a lot of it comes from my newly discovered pansexuality. After coming out to myself, it’s heightened my feelings of wanting to be another gender. 

But it’s not like I’m actively wanting to be female. I get these bouts every now and then, where I feel like I want to be someone I’m not, and it just happens that that someone isn’t a male.

Again, I think a lot of it comes from my sexuality. I’ve always found “traps” (please excuse my ignorance if that isn’t the correct term) absolutely stunning. And throughout the years, while closeted, I’ve had more than a few thoughts about wanting to be that way. 

It seems like the best of both worlds to me. But it’s gotten past the point where I would be completely okay doing that. Yet I’m conflicted for some reason. I don’t know, it seems to me all signs are pointing to me not being cis, and wanting more. Wanting to be more than I am. To be completely different. 

But there’s still something inside of me that’s telling myself that it’s maybe just standard feelings that guys might have, mainly because I only see myself as a male. I’ve never talked to anyone about this, as I’m sure the friends I have would be extremely uncomfortable. 

I think a lot of the issues I have is because of my religious upbringing, and those values still weighing on my heart through the indoctrination I was forced into as a kid, even though now I’ve been long gone from the Church and religion as a whole for half my life now.

TL.DR: Finally came out to my soon-wife (and for myself) as genderfluid, bisexual and she accepted me.

After more than twelve year self-delusion I finally came out a few weeks ago to my fiancée after in eight years together. But first, I have had to come out to myself.

I assigned as male, but before my tenth birthday, there were many sings I am not as like as the others. To keep it short, I find interest in girly clothes and sometimes I found it please when someone misspelled my name into a female name. In my country, we don't have gender-specific verbs and pronouns, and sadly, there are zero unisex given names (by the law, every given name must be used on only one gender). So, sometimes I found myself happy, when someone unintentionally changes just one letter, and formed my name into a female one.

I have to add, I had a lovely mom&amp;dad, but with strict gender stereotypes. They fulfilled the concept of man and female. Dad worked hard for the living, and in his free time,  he goes crafting something in the garage or go for fishing or working out, while mom stayed at home, and only do the house chores and take care of me. Anyway, before I could name my self what I am, I already filled with gender expectations. I didn't dare to show off my femme side, and somewhere, I felt abnormal.  To add up, they were a bit homophobic, but really far not drastic. They just said ""*They are different.""*  but don't put any effort to explain it to my younger-self, probably because of fear.

&amp;#x200B;

At my 13 years-old age, I did something bad.  I lost all of my friends from a mistake I made. This was a terrible and bad mistake, and I lost all my social connection and every day, I thought everyone laugh on me. I was humiliated, but this is not because of gender, I just did something really inappropriate.

I slowly fall into a deep depression for three years, without anyone who knows how many things hurts me. I really looked for love, any kind of love. I don't want to be dramatic, but I wrote my final later with my wills and I was ready to jump and sliced up by a train. I hated everyone who had fun on me, and I wanted to show them, what they did with me.

Within the depression, I found out, I need love. I know, I can't survive this on any other way. And soon again, I had to accept, I am so deep, I didn't even mind it's boy or girl (I hade narrowed minded with only two genders).

&amp;#x200B;

This was much harder and longer, but after an eternity, I found a girl who helped me, and does so today.  But my identity next to my girlfriend is just... I'm not the *man* she looked for. When she was away I lurked after her clothes, imagining myself as a girl. Sometimes I looked her do her makeup and when I saw she is happy as she is, I know something is not good with me, because I wanted to be in her place. Sometimes  I didn't want to be the Nordic Viking kind man she wants. But sometimes I tried hard, try to work out hard, but it wasn't me.  Now I know, most of the time I wanted to look, androgynes, but without proper information, I don't even know this is a thing. I wanted to look like both ways, and be anything/anyone who is I.

Before I met my soon-wife there was some special events where costumes and cross-dressing was accepted and hell... I really liked that. I felt my self first time full, but you already know, how much I fear from humiliation. So despite my feelings, I dropped the skirts and the makeups and be what I not really is.

My soon-wife in past eight years sometimes asked me serious questions, but without any bad intent. She wanted for me the best, and sometimes, she knew I hiding something. Maybe she feared that I don't love her. Most of the times, I handled this easily but once I decided, it's enough, and I need to know what is that I feel.

I had a hard two weeks of thinking. I had no fear. I know my soon-wife loves *me*, and the worst I can do is lie to both of us. From her perspective... previously she said, she loves me, but if I am into guys, it's not wrong, just tell it, because she does not want to live decades together if it isn't the best for both of us.

&amp;#x200B;

So there comes you, dear r/ genderfluid reditors. In the two weeks, I found out I was genderfluid all the time. I'm most of the times happy with how I'm, but on other days it's felt like stuck in a wrong body.  To state, I don't want to transition. When my femme side is up, the best I wish for a walk in public as female without others know this is not my assigned.  I wish the word accept me as a female in those days.

I want to live my femme side, but... simply I can't.

It was far in the past, but I still have fear from peoples. I look way to masculine. I'm 184cm hight (approx 6 feet), wide in shoulders and have some muscles, and I have a far deep voice.

I had to accept, I can't live as femme at public.

Finally, I wrote a novel about myself, about everything that led me here. The whole story was more than 40 full A4 pages, so I wrote out everything, each and last secrets and unspoken things. And I put my fate into my soon-wifes hand.

40 page is a lot, but finally, I was able to introduce my true self and tell the whole story, how I found out I'm bisexual and genderfluid. She knew many things before, but now, every last piece placed to the correct place.

She loves me, but I little hurt her with my secrets. We are really close to each other, and after 8 years this was a bit too many secrets. I spotted for her, these things not secrets before her, these were secrets before myself. She loves my manly side, and I can't blame her for being androsexual (as we know, she is cis-straight with some bi-curious intent, but she is in love with Viking types utterly). I told her, I know who I'm and I don't plan to do anything about it. I told her, I accepted myself, and least finally, I know what I feel. And I told her, maybe I change one or two little things, but my body type and social fears won't let me live my both side.

A weak ago, while we shopping in a mall, she just walked to a watch shop. We can't afford a nice watch right now, but she told me, I can have one at my irl cake-day. And the best thing is, she told that *we'll find something nice black or white, maybe rose-gold like... something which always fit for you.*

It hit me in the heart. I felt accepted and I know it's not much just a unisex watch, but this will my best birthdays gift ever.

&amp;#x200B;

My dreams always were vivid about my identity, but for sure, yet, I borrowed them. After I came out, my nighttime dreams just lost control. Almost every dream have some reference for me as femme. But most of the time, I fight against my fears. I fight against the world, which will never accept me as femme, and dream about hiding myself from my mom&amp;dad, whos probably will never know who I am really is.

After I spoked my dreams out to my love she casually offered me, if I wish, we can go and buy some clothes for me.

I know this is as hard for her as for me... She is more than kind.

To end my story, I refused her offer, because honestly, I'm not ready for this.

I like your stories, and it gave me strength... so I hope, I can do the same for someone.

I hope one day I can represent myself with pictures, but yet, this is my first big step.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you all!

I always called myself a tomboy, but that changed since the dysphoria started, I hate my body for real, but I'm almost sure I'm not trans (like 100% want to be a dude), because sometimes I feel okay being a girl, I feel more feminine from time to time but that's a bit rare in comparison to the times I feel masculine.  


The major problem I've been having apart from the dysphoria is the relationship with my boyfriend, we've been together for a long ass time and I love him a lot, but he's obviously straight and this doesn't really help me with my dysphoria cause whenever we get intimate it just makes me more aware of my body, he knows I see myself as genderfluid, and he's aware of my problems, I also suffer from depression and anxiety, and he's always been there for me and never once pressured me regarding sex, which we rarely have because of my dysphoria, the only times we have anything is when I'm feeling feminine, which again, is rare.  


I can't break up with him, we've been together for almost a decade and I love him too much.  
Do you have any similar problems? Any tips on how I could fix this? I started working out last month to see if my body changes to something more ""neutral"", he likes muscular woman so that wouldn't be a problem for him.
