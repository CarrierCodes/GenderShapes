Got a genderfluid haircut
Wear a binder (both masc and andro)
Wear a packer (when masc)

2019-05-01 11:58:18,bjg8i1,2,6,"I have struggled with my gender identity since I was 11 years old. I came out very early as a trans guy and had to fight hard to get other people (especially my family) to listen to me and take me seriously. I was very dysphoric since the beginning of my puberty and was 100% sure that I want to transition when I'm old enough to make that decision myself, because my parents wouldn't let me.
But... I think... three years after coming out I discovered I also had a ""feminine side"" and it confused me alot. Most of the time I'm still pretty sure that I want to go on T. But when I have one of those ""feminine days"" I kind of think different about it. It doesn't seem necessary then. And I think I'll never be able to make that decision, because my opinion keeps changing, the feminine days will always come back, just like the masculine days will do. I'm almost 20 years old and I could've went on hormones since 2016, but I never went to the doctor again because I was scared to make the wrong decision.
I also feel like I can't open up to anyone because I fought hard to be accepted as a trans guy and I don't want to destroy it and hear things like ""I knew it was a phase"" from them.
I should mention that, even though I have those fem days, I NEVER wear feminine clothing. I don't even own feminine clothing. But I wish I would. I wish I could experiment with my gender without being judged by my family or friends.
I've grown my hair out, it's now below my shoulders and my therapist asked me if I still want to be called by male pronouns. It made me very insecure. Now I'm thinking about cutting my hair short again because on male days it makes me dysphoric as hell and it feels like it does make me invalid as a guy. But it took me over a year to grow my hair this long and on fem days I do like it. I am so confused. I began writing in a journal whether I feel fem or masc and I've noticed that it's like 80% of the time masc, 20% of the time fem.

2019-05-02 16:57:09,bjxal4,11,34,"So this is my first post on reddit ever but after looking through the community it seems like the place to ask.

I'm a 31 AMAB who has always been mistaken for being gay because I have very feminine traits.
I never really considered it a thing when people said it because I was raised by my mother and aunts mostly and figured it's just what I learned growing up.

But recently after doing a lot of soul searching I've come to realise that I don't really consider myself to be Male all the time. I like to dress feminine sometimes and enjoy learning just being one of the girls. I've talked with a couple of friends and they believe that maybe I'm gender fluid because sometimes I'm ok with being a Male and others I would like to be considered female.

I'm just confused about it all and was hoping someone would be able to help put me on the right path.

2019-05-12 17:20:34,bnrgbv,5,8,"  

Hello,

Just to give a bit of context, I am in my early thirties, AFAB, and not identifying as a genderqueer or trans person yet, although I am questioning. I am very androgynous and get called both “Sir” and “Ma’am” a lot. I usually dress on the androgynous-masculine side of the spectrum, with the odd day where I’ll go ultra-feminine or genderfuck. 

I’ve recently been invited to a wedding and I’d like to take advantage of the occasion to buy some formal wear that reflects my current gender expression. That would mean a nice suit. I don’t have a hard time finding casual masculine clothes in my size, but when it comes to formal wear, it’s another story. Usually, the shoulders will be way too broad, or the trousers too tight around the hips. Suits designed for women generally fit but are too subtly feminine for my taste.

I am small (5’4, 115 lbs), athletic, with a mostly flat chest but narrow shoulders and wide hips. Does anyone know where I’d be able to find wedding-appropriate masculine clothes that might fit smaller and more femininely-built people like me with minimal tailoring?

I am very androgynous and get called both “Sir” and “Ma’am” a lot. I usually dress on the androgynous-masculine side of the spectrum, with the odd day where I’ll go ultra-feminine or genderfuck. \n\nI’ve recently been invited to a wedding and I’d like to take advantage of the occasion to buy some formal wear that reflects my current gender expression. That would mean a nice suit. I don’t have a hard time finding casual masculine clothes in my size, but when it comes to formal wear, it’s another story. Usually, the shoulders will be way too broad, or the trousers too tight around the hips. Suits designed for women generally fit but are too subtly feminine for my taste.\n\nI am small (5’4, 115 lbs), athletic, with a mostly flat chest but narrow shoulders and wide hips. Does anyone know where I’d be able to find wedding-appropriate masculine clothes that might fit smaller and more femininely-built people like me with minimal tailoring?

Hi...so I'm newly growing my very short hair out for the first time (amab) and I would like some advice as to what to do with my back edges &amp; sideburns in the meanwhile during the weird inbetween growing out process. I want to keep it tidy, but also want to grow out some length eventually. I've always had really tight fades &amp; bro-cuts previously, so this is all new to me.

Here's the passage:

It really has more to do with the context you find yourself in, but... it’s just simpler, most of the time, to tell people ‘male as hero, female as civilian.’ Molly, the other trans member of the Journeymen, was the only one who really understood - you wonder if Kaufman would get it too?

2019-05-30 10:55:48,burq9p,5,5,"I am starting to have a lot of doubts as to what I actually am, at start after years of denial I decided to find a gender therapist to talk about it and kinda thought I was clearly a trans woman, therapy didn’t rly help much other than being an anchor for me so I won’t go back into denial, so don’t suggest that because I literally cannot talk about more deeper stuff to therapists, only the person I’m emotionally attached to,so unless I find a therapist bf they are useless for me..

I spend many years in denial, really scared of any kind of femininity yet at the same time often had thoughts of being female, in both normal and sexual ways which I told no one, I was quite insecure about being paired with anything female, literally never shaved cuz of that reason too, and my insecurity was quite obvious to my best friend since he did notice like some areas about that felt like he touched a nerve so wasn’t even surprised when I told him.

The thing is at the start I obsessed over passing, like I thought I wanted to look fully female(mostly face/body wise since I despise make up and most female clothing since it’s all revealing and tight), but now after around 6 months of hrt I started liking my appearance, which rly isn’t very female yet in a way I’m ‘satisfied’

Like can be confused for a woman from the sides due to my long hair or from far away which I had before anyway, but pretty much everywhere we would go with my (gay male) friend on our vacations ppl called us ‘guys’, which I honestly never minded, randos opinions mean nothing to me really so never had this whole ‘waah they misgendered me thing’ probably because I’m unsure of my own gender at this point. Though I do enjoy when my friend makes jokes about me being a woman(not sexual) or use female pronouns in private since he knows I lean more that way but I don’t want everyone to do that, it is like I feel fine being a weird male in public using my chosen male name and keep that other side as something more ‘personal’

So in general, I kinda look like a fat guy with long hair and somewhat feminine face that is pretty male from the front, body is pretty chubby so boobs can probably pass as moobs outside and I wouldn’t mind having the bottom surgery since I always disliked having a penis since it always felt so wrong and useless but that is a far away dream now so I need the money for other stuff rn.

Though I do enjoy when my friend makes jokes about me being a woman(not sexual) or use female pronouns in private since he knows I lean more that way but I don’t want everyone to do that, it is like I feel fine being a weird male in public using my chosen male name and keep that other side as something more ‘personal’\n\nSo in general, I kinda look like a fat guy with long hair and somewhat feminine face that is pretty male from the front, body is pretty chubby so boobs can probably pass as moobs outside and I wouldn’t mind having the bottom surgery since I always disliked having a penis since it always felt so wrong and useless but that is a far away dream now so I need the money for other stuff rn.

2019-05-30 22:59:50,buztay,5,25,"So I finally found a name that sings to me.  

During my gender journey I learned a ton about myself.  I started life AMAB.    Egg cracked in my teens and discovered I definitely am not male nor do I prefer masculinity.  I identified as a girl because I had some body gender dysphoria.  I didn’t grow boobs during puberty.   I still want them to this day.  I had some downstairs dysphoria too but that was not as strong as my lack of breasts dysphoria.

I also learned that I love femininity.   I also felt restricted with masculinity.   

So I tried out different female names online and in public.   Such as Jessica and /u/_AmyChristine_.   While I did feel euphoria when called one of these names, I never bonded with them.  

So most of my life I was identifying as transgender female but I recently discovered a new aspect of my identity.   I do identify as male in some situations but that is not consistent and not constant.   However my identity as female is consistent but fluctuates.  

So I sought after a name that represented this aspect of my identity.   I found the name Riley.   Fell in love with and bonded to this name.  I am a Riley.   But I was lacking a middle name.  

I learned that Riley started out as a masculine male name that transitioned to one of the most popular unisex names.   

So tried /u/RileyChristine and felt it was too feminine and not fluid enough.  

I the tried /u/RileyCadence.  Loved the
Meaning and was unisex enough but just wasn’t right.   

I still identify as transgender but also as gender fluid.   

Now I am Riley Kendall &lt;insert last name here&gt;.   

I learned that Kendall also started out as a boys name.  

So putting them together sounds very pretty and feminine while technically and historically masculine.   

So the search is over.   Now to come out as gender fluid and start using this name everywhere.   

Thanks for reading.

2019-05-31 01:34:25,bv1f5a,3,7,"Long post warning!

So my whole life I have identified as male, but I have always had female tendencies. When I was in adolescence I would always throw my moms clothing on and walk around. I was always met with laughs as I was always the funny guy and it was me just “messing around”. My sister and I would play games together and my favorite was the game, Pretty Pretty Princess. I loved winning and being able to put on the tiara and call myself the Princess. I have had fleeting thoughts about my sexuality and my identity more recently and it has been very disheartening. I have always been this “big guy” and people see me as this tough man but I feel so feminine compared to the outlook of others. 

Brining this full circle, today at work a coworker was talking to me and asked me a question, “how do you identify?”

I was not prepared for this question at all because it is one that I have avoided myself, and have not put much thought to my response. I quickly responded, “male” and now I question that my response is really how I feel.

My (f)iancé and I have had discussions about this subject matter. She has told me that I am who I am and that is okay. But the issue is, is that I don’t know who I am! 

I am just looking for some tips on how you guys have worked thru these identity crisis’ and how fluid this whole gender thing is! 

Thanks!!!

2019-05-31 01:55:36,bv1n4p,4,7,"Hi all! I am AFAB. 24 years old and living like a female my entire life. Well, kind of. I was never into traditionally ""girly"" things growing up, or even really now. I didn't wear dresses, didn't seek out makeup and cute clothes, never did anything with my hair. Nothing. Didn't even care about dolls. I liked playing outside and wearing big shirts. Hated tight clothes and all that jazz. It's how I lived. As a girl. And I never really thought twice about it.

Late last year, my husband told me that he thinks that he's transgender and feels like a female. Okay cool no problem, let's work through this. I've been supporting him (yes, still him, he's not quite there with the pronouns yet). While talking about all this with him, I figured out that I feel some of the same feelings as he does.

I have breasts that I wish were slightly smaller just to where I don't need a bra (I'm not enormous by any means, I'd just like them a bit smaller). But I don't feel like they don't belong. I have no real issue with my plumbing down there, other than having periods. A penis isn't super appealing, but pretending could be fun. I like my girly underwear as much as my boxers. I just bought a dress that I love, but I'm not super confident in it. I love my more masculine clothing as well. Still don't have an interest in makeup or doing my hair other than trying a bit of color. I don't hate my very feminine name, but also sometimes wished it was more neutral. I don't really want body hair, but still hate shaving. None of this stuff is super off putting too me. I have days where I just want to wear boxers and have really short hair, but there's other days where I'm completely content in my girl body.

And my husband told me I might be nonbinary. Please don't take offense, but I'm not super fond of the term. To me, binary is ones and zeros and if you're nonbinary, in my head, you can't have parts of either. So here I am at gender fluid. I'm also okay with gender queer I think, though I'm still learning all the terms and stuff.

My husband and I both attend therapy separately, and this is something that we talk about openly. We're planning on attending some of the gender community meetings when my schedule changes (our region has great support for this stuff).

I think the weird thing about all this is that I'm not feeling the need to come out or hide anything from anyone. If anything, I'm hiding the more outwardly feminine stuff, because I'm not confident. But if people find out that I'm fluid, I really don't care.

How did you all come to find out that you're gender fluid? What are some things that you wear or do to present all genders (I'm wearing boxers with my nails painted right now). What's your favorite thing about being fluid? How did you build your confidence?
