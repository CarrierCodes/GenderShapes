2019-03-01 05:36:22,aw15yb,16,8,"Hi r/genderfluid! Lovely meeting you all here. I have a gender fluid friend who I recently met, and after talking with her about her experiences it kinda made me think if I may be gender fluid or not. 

Some background: I recently found out I was aromantic, it introduced me to a lot of new terms and ideas, and decided to look more into the gender part. Ever since I was younger, I always preferred boy things, not just video games and stuff like that, but like I thought other girls were weird, and even thought to myself how I would’ve liked being a bit better sometimes. I still knew I was a girl though and I felt like a girl, just with a more masculine mentality 

Present day, I consider myself to have both a balance between a masculine and feminine mentality. I’ve recently becoming a lot more curious about cross dressing, and whenever I wear super girly clothes I feel so uncomfortable. However, this is where the non binary/agender part comes into play. Looking at myself, and back on my life, sometimes the thought of gender is just like, “I’m me though, and I feel like I don’t really fit into any category” maybe that’s cause of my mentality? I’m very weird. I prefer dressing in guy/andryogonous clothes, however I like some of my feminine features, like my breasts and such. It’s a very odd, grey area.

The thing I’m most worried about though is that if I do come to the conclusion I am not cisgender, I think it will be hard for me to accept personally. I’ve lived my entire life thinking I’m female, and although it would be relaxing knowing I’m living my life the way I prefer knowing I’m not cis, I think it could shock me and my family, while also going against my religion. (I’m so sorry if that came off as offensive to any of you, I think it’s awesome that your all gender fluid. Just for me personally I’ve always thought I was female and I think it would shock me for awhile to realize 100% I wasn’t actually cis)

2019-03-04 18:58:03,axatnk,3,1,"Hi all, 24-year-old AMAB here. Pretty much what it says in the title; I'm fluctuating a lot between feeling as though I'm just a cis guy or a trans woman. I know I don't want to transition, but I keep asking myself if that's because I physically don't want to, or if I'm just scared of it. Because I *am* scared of it. Like, terrified. I talked to a friend of mine about it for the first time the other day (cis guy) and he told me that it seemed like I was ""scared of losing control of my own narrative,"" which seems pretty accurate. 

It's like, when I get dysphoric (which I am now) I experience it almost as an alien thing trying to take over my body. It doesn't feel like a part of me so much as it does someone holding a gun to my head and being like ""you better transition or this is never going to go away. You're never going to be happy."" But I don't feel like a girl, and I don't identify with a lot of ""girly"" things. I've lurked the MtF subreddit and always felt kind of wigged out, or out of sync with them. I don't want to wear dresses (I don't think) or be overtly feminine. It's like, if I was a girl I would be a tomboy or even butch. I'm 6' 1'' and don't relate at all to the common refrain of wanting to be ""small and cute;"" I love being tall and sometimes wish I was taller. What I *do* like about being a girl, though, is the sensitivity, and especially the feeling of ""innate value."" I feel like women have an innate value, while men don't; they are only valued by what they do. I want to be treasured, cherished, desired. I feel like, as a guy, others don't treat me with an innate worth in the same way (I feel like this might run counter to a lot of women's lived experiences, but I figured I should put it in just the same). 

And then I'll go through periods where I love being a man and pretty much everything about it. I'll go ""bro out"" with my friends and love it, love being a big dumb guy, love being strong, etc. I love watching shit like BroScienceLife (I know, I know) and just generally interacting with others in a masculine way. At times like that it almost feels like it was someone totally different who was lurking these subs, and I'll be like ""wtf was I doing lol?"" 

In both ""modes"" (although it's more of a continuum than discrete frames) the other one feels weird and I'll come up with rationalizations for why I felt that way. When I'm feeling dysphoric, all of my masculine stuff feels like a mask, and when I'm not dysphoric I tend to assign my ""feminine"" identifying features to my profound discomfort at being a ""sensitive"" man (I come from a family with pretty strict gender roles and a lot of negativity towards femininity in general, from both men and women).

I found this sub and was like, ""holy shit that's me,"" but it wasn't long before I read about people who used ""genderfluid"" as a stepping stone because they didn't feel comfortable identifying as binary trans, and I got depressed again. I read about trans women who regret not transitioning sooner and I feel like, if this is going to end in transitioning I better get it over with. I don't want to deal with this at all--I'd much rather clear the dysphoria on the male side than be a female--but since I can't ignore it I want to take steps to fix it as soon as possible. Even though I know that's probably not possible :/

Anyway, thanks for reading. I know that nobody here can read my mind and tell me what to do, but it makes me feel better that yall are here and I'm not alone in working through this. 

PS: It's probably noteworthy that I've only experienced overt dysphoria for like, the past six months, although I can think of a few times in my past when I said or thought about things in what I might retroactively consider dysphoria.

I’ve thought about what it would be like to be a woman and I can definitely see myself being happy with a “girl-next-door” type of personality, not anything ultra-feminine. The thing is, I can also see myself being happy as a man - I could very clearly before this past week and still kind of can now, though now I realize that some of the existential anguish I’ve felt in the past might have been indirect dysphoria. I’ve felt physical dysphoria for the first time this past week - at least I think it’s dysphoria - but when I looked back at my past to try and find any moments of gender euphoria, the only feminine thing I found was the time I realized wearing a oversized t-shirt with short shorts was incredibly comfortable. But every other euphoric memory I can think of besides that was very masculine. They were times I felt validated as a man, that I was part of a male community, and before questioning my gender was one of the most comforting aspects of my life. I don’t want to lose all the things I loved about my maleness and if I could press a button to stop me from worrying about my gender ever again but not change anything else I would not hesitate to push it. 

Over the past week my mind has just been a mess. I think I’m a girl and feel comfort until I realize that means permanently leaving being a man behind and I get scared and the anxiety comes back. I think I’m a cis guy and feel comfort but theb my thoughts start telling “oh you’re just in denial” and I get anxious again. Then I think to myself that gender is fucking stupid and I don’t need to identify with anything because identity is a social construct and nothing in my life matters and it feels liberating but it never lasts, because reality hits and the questioning returns. I want to go back to being a cis guy again, but I feel like these thoughts aren’t gonna go away.

I’m just so stressed. This is already taking a toll on my schoolwork and an even bigger toll on my sports, and all I want is to get to a position where I’m not thinking about my gender 24/7. Aside from sleep the longest I’ve gone without contemplating it this past week has been around thirty minutes. I feel like I’m going insane.

Does this sound at all like genderfluidity? I kind of want to try estrogen, but I don’t want breasts, and while having a vagina sounds nice I also really love my penis and want to keep it.

So, I have a theory that I might be genderfluid, but there are things that confuse me. I'm AFAB, but it's not like I despise it. In fact, I quite enjoy it sometimes. But other times, I just dont feel like a female if that makes sense. I dont feel male either. When someone refers me as ""she"", its not like I feel super uncomfortable.. I just feel like I'm wearing a mask, or as if my identity is hidden away if someone uses female pronouns on me(even though they're the pronouns I mostly prefer). I've also thought ahead of time; when I get married, I wanna be referred to as the wife. I wanna wear a wedding dress and become a mom. It's just sometimes, I dont feel connected to being a female, even though its my preferred gender and pronoun. I've been thinking I might just be a tomboy, but it's not like Im super masculine. It's more about how connected I feel to the genders. I dont really feel connected to any of them. 

It's just, if I was really genderfluid, shouldnt I be leaning further away from my birth gender?

I don’t know what counts as being a man anymore, and on top of occasionally feeling feminine, I’ve experience straight up dissociative episodes where I had to remind myself who I was.  What’s weird is that I actually want to be more manly, even though I feel like my mannerisms and identity fluctuate slightly. I’ve thought that I was bigender or non-binary quite a few times (essentially a boy but kind of a girl), but I’ve never wanted to get rid of my current body (my body is hella nice and I worked hard to build it!). I also don’t necessarily think that anything I do makes me definitively not a guy, which I am okay with. Most femme things don’t appeal that much to me, save for light makeup or cross dressing for entertainment. But I know I feel my best when I feel like a man, and that a super femme look is not for me. I also know that I really love women and lowkey think they’re better than men, which has lead me to believe that I’ve actually internalized an inferiority complex about being a man. But I know that I am one for the most part and can’t really abandon it, although I do dislike feeling restricted by a role. 

My theory is that I see my body as binary, but my spirit as something more. Like my mind wants to just do what it wants even though it doesn’t want to let go of masculinity. Femme me feels like a separate person I let out rather than the actual me.  I find it natural for me to disobey social rules and trends (autism spectrum). I could see myself cosplaying with another name but I love my birth name and will never give it up. I’ve also wanted titties purely for sexual purposes, but not as an identity thing. I see that as oversexualizing a feature and being jealous of a sensation, not necessarily thinking that this should be on my body permanently (that would be cumbersome and aesthetically displeasing). I looked at man boobs and decided they were not a great look. All permanent changes are out of the question. I would much rather have multiple bodies I could switch between. I also don’t care about pronouns and just want people to call it how they see it. 

I don’t know why I think about these things, I just want to be me and forget about it. At the end of the day, people’s opinions matter little to me, it’s all about being an adult human male who’s trying their best to live a good life. I don’t really have a point to this post, just wanted to get these things off my chest and take it slow from here on out. Ima still call myself a guy because it’s technically correct, but I am a guy and then some, and I am starting to accept that. I think labels that could work include nonconforming male, bigender, or nb,  but I still feel closer to cis than anything else so it’s real confusing and frustrating for me to have to choose one. So I’m not gonna choose one, ima just do whatever the fuck I want and see what happens. Hopefully I can inspire other men to be more adventurous and to know themselves better.

I think I'm fluid because I think sometimes I want to be male, female, or something else entirely, and being fluid really fit that identity very well and makes me comfortable.

The problem arises when I try to figure out what gender I am at a certain time. When I have a gender in mind that I feel like being, there's no problem: I'm free to be myself. It's just that sometimes... I have no idea and nothing springs to mind.

I might be agender during these times because I don't have anything in mind, but a lot of times that doesn't seem right either.

The process of questioning and ""what am I?"" is really annoying, especially because I can't seem to find a gender identity that I really resonate with.

I wish I could just be a gender that I feel like when that's the case, and when I don't have any idea, just move on with my day without a gender. But not knowing your gender sucks.

2019-03-17 22:45:18,b2b2p7,5,33,"Hi!

I’m 23/AFAB non-binary. 8i really, really would appreciate if at least ONE awesome person took the time to read this and respond.

And yet I don’t even understand what non-binary really IS. I know I feel it to an extent, as I feel dysphoria to an extent, but I’m at odds. And I’ll explain. Everything I italicize is going to include a question. 

Basic life story: was an extreme tomboy until I hit puberty. I mean, I really preferred to play with boys and boy things. *Dinosaurs and flinging mud were my shit, while dolls and dress up weren’t... at all.* but that doesn’t mean anything necessarily, or does it?

I was a very VERY awkward kid. My teachers wanted me screened for autism (which I believe I probably have but have never actually been screened so I can’t say I have it for certain). I remember going to the mall with my ONE female friend when I was 12. I picked out a giant baggy men’s band t shirt (I was probably a child’s large at the time, and I was picking out a mans large. I barely would grow more, maybe 20 lbs heavier, but I didn’t know that). She looked at me funny and told me to get one the right size and gender, and that’s when I knew I was sorta different “than other girls”. 

By 13 I was wearing makeup, not because I wanted to really but because it made me look older and get more serious attention I think. I remember hating waking up and putting it on in the morning but I felt like I needed to. I also subscribed to the “emo style” by this point. So dumb, but at the time, very depressed 13 yo me (who had like, nothing to be depressed about anyway) felt a rare sense of belonging.

By 14 I “looked” fully feminine. As a child I was pretty damn androgynous (short hair, baggy clothes, same clothes every day although that may relate to the autism stuff) but then I was wearing makeup and grew my hair longer and learned some more basic girl skills and hygiene skills (as a 12 yo I’d go A LONG TIME w/o showering or changing clothes).

This is a weird thing but by age *15 I could finally touch my own genitals and breasts*. And no, I was *NEVER molested as a child. I’ve spoken with my parents about this. I know for a fact if they knew I’d been molested they would have first off, told me, and secondly, killed that person.* But there comes the question. By age 15, I had probably had some semblance of a sex drive for half my life. Why couldn’t I touch my own vagina...ever? I had thoughts that somehow I was wrong and broken down there. 

I had fantasies of having a penis by this time also, and having sex with girls instead of boys. My first sexual experiences were with girls. We didn’t know what we were doing, really, but I know I enjoyed them immensely: thereby, making me at least bisexual because I like guys also.

Thing is, I’m 23 now, have fully accepted my sexuality and to a lesser extent my non-binary gender; but I feel almost robbed of it because it was never mentioned to me as a child. I struggled feeling differently for years, maybe partially because autism, but also from other women/girls. It was like bisexuality and gender didn’t exist to anyone around me. You were gay or straight. You are boy or girl. And trans people  exist, but they’re incredibly incredibly rare and you’ll maybe see one every few years (NOT THE CASE!!!!!). And maybe this is because my parents are really, 100% part of the binary. They’re great, really. But my mom never questioned her womanhood. She loved being pregnant (I would feel so awful and dysphoric being pregnant). She’s 100% straight, or so she’s always insisted (how?! I really don’t even see how this is POSSIBLE lmao!, I mean, when I was 11 my female friends and I were showing off and touching each others’ boobs and kissing, and while they may say it was a phase for them, it wasn’t for me!)

Anyways, 

Tl;dr: I consider myself completely non-binary but feel like a joke because from puberty onward I dressed up and wore makeup. Now people consider my hair (short, shaved) and my male dress as some sort of fashion statement, which makes me roll my eyes into the back of my head.

I’m terrified of being seen as a joke. I wish there was some way of “proving to myself and others” that I’m enby, but I know you really can’t and shouldn’t feel the need to.

2019-03-18 01:13:50,b2ckd5,5,24,"Hey everyone! I've been lurking here for a couple months; starting after I came out to my girlfriend. We actually both came out as bi at the same time, and then I was like ""Oh wait, there's more!"". Her and I have been together for 2 years at this point, so I was terrified, but she has been super helpful and supportive.
 I grew up (and live) in the southern US, right in the bible belt. I came from a very religious, southern baptist family. I was told I had to be ""normal"" in both gender and sexuality, or I would get to take the quick trip to the deep pit. I bought into those toxic ideas for years, and it tore me apart. It wasn't until I was in rehab after a suicide attempt (where I spent my sweet 16) that I started meeting people who were learning to be themselves. When I got back I became an ally. Finally. But, I still couldn't accept myself for who I am. This is all scary, but I'm finally able to be me.
 I've only came out to a few close friends and my Dad (who wasn't part of my toxic family), and they've all been really cool about it. Some more than others, but overall I've been surprised.

Anyway, I dunno if this counts as genderfluid but here goes.

I am a bisexual, biological female. I've always appreciated the beauty in both(now all :)) genders. When I was little I lived as a girl, and imagined myself as a boy. In videogames I would switch genders of my avatars because it was so hard to pick. I dunno, I've just always loved both. And when I discovered androgyny it was just &lt;3

I'm alright with presenting as female. It really just depends on who I'm around. But the dom male in me really just *loves* girls. I change my behavior in relationships, and see myself as male or depending on who I'm with/their personality. I'm never both at the same time, but I do switch a lot.

It's like a charge of masculine/feminine energy runs through me whenever I interact with them.

 It changes how I act, dress, talk, and see myself mentally. I recognize that my sex is still female and that's cool, but I don't really care what pronouns you call me (except They/Them, it confuses me ha) He/Him is alright too.

Does anyone else feel like this? Lemme know! Or don't. (But it'd be cool cuz I'm lonely and like to talk about life and stuff with other people)

2019-03-23 00:33:37,b4cqym,5,10,"Hey guys so I’ve been agonizing over my gender for the past 3-4 months. 
So I suffer from OCD, depression and anxiety. 
I was always fine with being a man and then once I explored my feminine side I couldn’t stop and I came to this weird conclusion that something was missing in my life, I just didn’t know what. 
So after months of research into gender roles and transition and such, I’m just so confused still. 
I have no physical dysphoria, I like my body hair and beard. 
There is always a voice in my mind that says you’re a woman, sometimes it says I’m a man, but most of the time it’s woman and I guess if that was inevitable truth I’d accept it but when I look through mtf timelines and stuff sometimes I’m like I want to do that other times I’m like nah I’m happy as a guy. 
Sometimes I can get this overwhelming surge to transition and I believe I have to, and then it can fade and I’m like hmm I don’t mind being a guy for now, and I have this feeling full transition would end in regret. 
I still present masculine etc and have tried non-binary but it doesn’t seem to fit, I want to be gender fluid so I am free of all expectations and I don’t want to be 100% anything because I’ll feel trapped but there’s still that voice that says you’re a woman, even when I have no desire to alter my body. My brain also says you want to be her when I see a girl in the street, the thing is when I dissociate from these thoughts sometimes they feel like not legit, like OCD.

the problem is that in my head, this is entirely tied to my weight. because i'm a bigger person, any feminine clothes i could wear are made for people with absolutely massive boobs, and i had top surgery half a year ago, so that's just entirely out. i guess i could buy breast forms, but the bigger you go, the more expensive they get. mostly, it feels like the only way to ease my feminine dysphoria is to lose weight. that seems like a really unhealthy mindset to be in, but i'm not sure what other solution could possibly present itself.

2019-03-25 00:30:02,b53sgr,2,3,"And I just wanted to share a little of my story because I don't think I can come out anywhere else right now, and maybe it will help someone who is struggling like I was just like so many post have helped me. I'm sorry if its long and a little rambly but I've had an emotionally intense day.

I was raised southern bapitst in Alabama in a very conservative area. I'm sure you are all aware of how Christian conservatives feel about the lgbtq community. As a Christian I was never against equal rights for all regardless of sexuality or gender, I convinced myself and my Christian friends that it was an issue between homosexuals, transgender, and god but not me. I told them I felt that we were supposed to love all as Jesus did even if they were sinners but in my heart I felt god was wrong to condem people for loving one another regardless of gender. Maybe it should have been a hint about my own gender issues, but I think I had internalized the feelings of diffrent genders and sexualities being wrong despite how I really felt. 

I'm 28 now and I finally have a label for how I feel, I'm bigenderflux between male and female, which means I feel as if I am one or both genders with diffrent intensities at times. I feel like I'm a little late to the party to be coming out to myself at this age but even though I deconverted a few years ago I've still been in denial with those internalized feelings of being wrong. I don't think I could have told you I had those feelings before the last couple weeks but even though I suspected I was not the straight cis man I was presenting, I was always reluctant to learn more about the lgbtq community in general and confront those feelings. I finally had to ask myself why I was so afraid of learning more about lgbtq? Why couldn't I admit to myself sometimes I felt female and wanted to be female? Once I confronted and realized those feelings from my past, that those archaic Christian values, were what was limiting me I finally could step past them. I've been learning about being trans, I've been lurking on various trans subreddits for the last couple weeks as well as doing google searches for more info or to define terms I didn't know before. I had a good laugh at myself over at r/egg_irl, more than half of my custom characters are female, and really enjoyed the supportive community of this sub as well as others. 

I stumbled on genderflux last night and it's resonated with me. I know labels shouldn't be important but having one helps me feel like I understand myself better, like there are other people who understand that I'm not alone, and that I can finally let go to the last of those internalized feelings of being wrong for feeling feminine. I said it ""I am genderflux"" aloud to myself but the title is my first confession to anyone else and it feels good to finally share a little. 

I've decided today that even though my given name is gender neutral (lucky draw), for now at least I want a separate one that exclusively feminine for when I feel mostly female. I feel that part of me deserves some special recognition after being denied for so long. I've already made this account and to be my closet trans account and given it a cute username. And I've been trying out Rachel in my head as a real name for when I'm female. I like that it and my given name both start with R but are otherwise completely diffrent and also think 'Ray' is a cute gender neutral nickname. However, I found out it is a Hewbrew name that means female sheep, and while I have nothing personal against sheep I don't like the idea of representing myself as one. Maybe I am overthinking it but I also considered Tally which is a little less common and a name I've enjoyed giving to my game avatars.

I don't know how I want to present myself yet, come out of the closet irl, if I might want to transition, or try hrt. That is ok though, I can take it slow and learn and explore these feelings on my own time. What's most important is that today for the first time I can say I feel feminine, I feel like she more than he and thats ok with me to do.

2019-03-26 15:53:58,b5rea8,31,7,"Disclaimer: I am new to research. I am not a scientific student. I am just a trans woman who has been on hormones for a little over 3 years. 

---

Here are all my questions:

* do you have body dysphoria 
* do you label your identity as transgender 
* do you experience sexual disfunction and dysphoria 
* are you on hormones 
* do you do body modification 

I have been trying to tease apart different structural diagnostic criteria and tease apart the nuanced differences between ""trans"" archetypes of individuals. For example, the word transsexual is explicitly used for folks who are taking medications and often getting surgery to fix a deep and profound loathing of their body as it existed since birth and especially after puberty.  However, a cross dresser, who is biologically the same from birth, does not take interest in such things. Therefore these complexes are not the same thing, and aren't treated as the same thing. 

I am researching into which (for lack of better term) factions of identity that are falling under the transgender movement flag are also experiencing problems with their sex lives and bodies, as well as just their assigned and expected behaviors. Those three things seem paradigm for transsexual, but not so with other 'labels'. 

Gender fluid to me as I perceive it is more similar to a goth clothing style, than to someone who would want surgery. The perception of one's ego and identity as it is expressed in their subjective culture might shift the way someone who cross dresses does. Their ability to self define and step out of the usual (as a goth might) seems the focus of the expressed behavior as it manifests VISIBLY. My curiousity extends deeper than what is visible, as not everyone who expressed fluidity dresses up differently at all. Therefore, it cannot be the same category as a cross dresser, or clothing and life style such as a goth. It must be different.

Again, to be clear, This is not to label gender fluid as cross dressing or a fashion statement. I don't believe it is, nor am I trying to prove that. In fact it's the opposite, I'm trying to find the neurological origin of these things but first I need to know which individuals to research further into and in what capacity. Is this an intersex condition? If so, to what extent? Does the complex exist outside of the western conception of gender as it has evolved to become? 

As I understand it, the discomfort with the stereo typical roles in society is where the exestential discomfort is expressed most profoundly. Often this is treated by neutralizing self perceived identity,  or society demanded roles by politely asking friends and family to use different pronouns, and perhaps dressing and using body form modification at times to blend in better with either a neutral or altered archetype the way a transsexual might also do, but often with no proclivity towards HRT or surgery. That is to say, you can have a gothic mindset without dressing goth. I don't believe goth is a neurological complex. I am trying to tease out where biology is playing and where social conditioning is playing.

2019-03-28 05:46:28,b6f1cn,8,12,"Dear girls I need some help.

I'm engaged to be married to a wonderful girl this October. I'm very attracted to her and other females in general.

But I'm also attracted to men (I've been with some and some trans girls - girls with cocks). 

I have gay friends, that act ""normally"" (like cis males but date other man) but it's my desire to be girly, paint my nails, shave all my body, behave like a female, but I think my coworkers (and specially my family and fiance) wouldn't be able to deal with it. 

What am I? What should I do? I'm the kind of guy who would wear my fiance panties and clothes if she goes on a travel. Since I live in a smallish town in afraid to go to gay bars and stuff and be discovered. 

What can I do? Should I just keep the secret since I could get in a bad position with my bosses and lose the woman I love or should I talk to her and make it clear that I also want to be feminine? 

One of my closest friends is gay, and he says I'm gayer than him, all I'm missing is love for cock (he knows I had some gay experiences with a mutual friend). 

If I had a magic lamp I'd wish to be born a pretty girl and I'd probably would want to date boys and girls, but as a 33 old male I don't know what to do. 

Sorry for the long post and bad grammar, but English is not my first language and I'm kind of drunk.

What should I do? I\'m the kind of guy who would wear my fiance panties and clothes if she goes on a travel. Since I live in a smallish town in afraid to go to gay bars and stuff and be discovered. \n\nWhat can I do? Should I just keep the secret since I could get in a bad position with my bosses and lose the woman I love or should I talk to her and make it clear that I also want to be feminine? \n\nOne of my closest friends is gay, and he says I\'m gayer than him, all I\'m missing is love for cock (he knows I had some gay experiences with a mutual friend). \n\nIf I had a magic lamp I\'d wish to be born a pretty girl and I\'d probably would want to date boys and girls, but as a 33 old male I don\'t know what to do. \n\nSorry for the long post and bad grammar, but English is not my first language and I\'m kind of drunk.\n\nThanks anyway.\n\nEdit: I\'ve dressed in girls clothes since I was a teen (when my parents traveled I would wear my mom clothes, even her wedding dress one or two times).', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'What can I do? /post from r/mefetishism', 'created': 1553777188.0}"

I think I might be NB but I'm not sure. I always get irritated when I'm called a girl but I feel 'handicapped' by my gender when I try to accomplish certain tasks (exercise, lose weight, etc). I have to keep pulling back on social media because people posting selfies makes me very upset, especially since I lack confidence.

I feel like I crossdress when I'm wearing dresses and makeup and my dad used to call me a 'drag queen' when I would go out in a dress or a skirt. 

I just want to feel comfortable. My face feels like something halfway between a man or a womans but I am not as attractive as all the nonbinaries I keep seeing online. I'm not sure what to do anymore. :(

I've tried therapy, tried searching online but the only option I get is to transition. I dont want to transition because my dysphoria is in my head and changing my body wont help.
