2019-01-03 09:03:01,ac3yy2,8,1,"Mods, let me know if this isn't allowed, and I'll remove it.

Hey everyone! I'm a college theatre student currently doing my senior thesis capstone project. I recently just did A Midsummer Nights Dream by Shakespeare, and I played Oberon (King of the Fairies, normally played by an amab person) as an afab genderfluid person (they/them btw). Part of my project is about representation of genderfluid/non-binary/trans people in theatre and modern media. 

Unfortunately, there aren't too many sources about this topic that are longer than a small article. On top of that, I am not allowed to use my own experiences and perspective as a genderfluid person to back up my paper. Although, my professors have allowed me to crowdsource info!

So, I ask you all, what does it mean to you when there is genderfluid/non-binary/trans representation in a character in your preferred entertainment? How about just the actor themselves being the representation, even if theyre playing a cis role? How do you feel about female-presenting people playing male-presenting parts and vice versa? What do you feel if/when you see representation of your gender? Why?

Lastly, how long do you feel non-cis-gender people have been around? Why? Do you feel that the recent naming of different genders (as in anything other than just male and female) has helped or hindered the process of allowing non-cis-gender people to become accepted in the society you live in?

I have tried to make the questions as neutral as possible so I don't lead you to answer one way or another. Feel free to answer any of these questions, or whatever you feel may be related that you feel strongly about. Anything helps!

I figured I was something for a long time.  I used to jokingly tell friends I was a lesbian in high school because I can be pretty effeminate, but I also am only attracted to women.  At one point, a friend told me he though I might be trans, but that wasn't it.

I still just use male pronouns typically, but I'm okay with whatever really because I'm just about all of the things at some point.  I'm out to my parents and siblings, some online friends, and my girlfriend, but my girlfriend is really the only one I tell about my gender feelings, as I personally call them, since I've found it easy to compare to a mood or a feeling for me.  I'm not publicly out either, which is why I've got this brand new reddit account right here.  I've decided to come out of my shy she'll of social anxiety and maybe make some friends here or something.

So, crash course on me.  I'm a poor college student (though, I'll hopefully get a job soon), I like music, film, and video games (occasionally I can get into a book, though I love comics and graphic novels), and I'm in a long distance relationship (which also happens to be my first actual relationship too).  I'm currently playing FFXV, but I got Monster Hunter World and Dragon Ball FighterZ for Christmas and haven't played much of them yet, so I'll probably get to those soon.

2019-01-07 13:33:08,adhp3t,8,1,"Hi. I’m here to ask about something. Is what I’m experiencing considered dysphoria? 

Whenever I have to get up to go to school in the morning, everything’s fine until I open my closet and see my skirt hanging there. I feel so horrible and uncomfortable wearing it. I don’t feel like myself.
I hate it when my family says “you’re a beautiful young lady” or “you’re a lovely girl, dear.” 
I know that they’re only trying to be nice and caring, but I just feel this horrible drop in my stomach when anyone refers to me as a “girl” or “lady”. The word “she” usually goes unnoticed, but sometimes it can really get to me. 
I dislike that my school is very segregated between girls and boys. We have to play sport separately, the girls are required to wear skorts when playing sports and the boys and girls just seem to hate each other in general. Because of this I hate playing sport at school. Actually I just dislike going to school because of that segregation in general. I feel so uncomfortable in the changing rooms so I usually get changed in the bathrooms. 
I also dislike how I have to hang out with the girls. Sure I don’t have to, but I’m too shy to introduce myself to anyone or ask to hang out with anyone (I’m a new student), so the girls just immediately try and drag me along with them. I appreciate their kindness, it’s just I don’t feel like I belong around them. They don’t really have the same interests as me anyways. 
I tried binding a few times (using a small crop top) outside of school and it made me feel so much more confident in my own body.

There are also lots of other things that make me feel horrible in my body, but I feel like I would be dumping too many of my personal problems into a reddit post.

2019-01-08 22:00:31,adzi5v,4,1,"First post here. Sorry if this gets long. 

I'm AMAB and recently sort of came out as genderfluid. I'm 29 and have had an interest in women's fashion since I was very young, around 6 years old or so, possibly earlier. I grew up in a very Conservative household in the American South and these kind of interests were not at all encouraged in boys. So, early on I felt shame and embarrassment for this and for years would sneakily crossdress in my mom's clothes whenever my parents were away.  


I got caught by my parents a couple times that I remember. The first time I was pretty young and they mostly just laughed it off as a kid being curious. The next time my mom caught me when I was a teenager and she was a little more worried. Thought maybe I was gay which would never be accepted, but eventually she just chalked it up to me doing this because of a budding interest in girls, a ridiculous premise maybe, but it's the kind of idea a parent will concoct when they don't want to accept the alternatives. This was never brought up again and within a few years I moved out to go to college.  


In college, I mostly suppressed my desires to explore my feminine side. I started dating and getting in relationships with different girls (something I hadn't done at all in high school) which I guess temporarily filled the void, living vicariously through their femininity. 

&amp;#x200B;

I knew that desire was always there, but I wrestled with my own identity and wondering if my desire for feminine expression was worth the potential ridicule or changing the perception of me with those I knew. There was the further confounding aspect to this all in that I did not feel trans insomuch that I did not feel like I no longer felt comfortable being male. I was okay with being male most of the time and I felt further guilty that exploring this side was performative in a way, that I was simply turning on and off femininity when it felt advantageous to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, I got in a relationship in my early 20's with a woman to whom I am now married and have a child. This previous year, she hesitantly expressed to me that she had long had a secret attraction to transwomen.   


This came as a bit of a shock to me but was welcome news as it made me realize her thoughts on gender were far more nuanced and progressive than I had initially anticipated. I had suppressed my own desires throughout the relationship, because when we had casually talked about trans or gender non-conforming people in the past, she seemed slightly averse to the idea.

&amp;#x200B;

This emboldened me to come clean to her about my history of crossdressing. She was initially extremely accepting. I was over the moon to the point where I probably pushed too hard starting off. I had finally met someone who accepted a side of me that I thought would never be accepted. It's with her help that we settled upon the label of ""genderfluid."" I did not have a good understanding of this before, but I finally felt like there was some sort of label that truly fit how I felt. 

&amp;#x200B;

We went to the store and picked out some underwear for me. In the coming months, she bought some lingerie, a top, and some make-up for me, but as time went on, she started to push back.   


She became increasingly uncomfortable with me dressing in feminine clothes even at home. She accused me of trying to take her femininity from her and thereby forcing her to some sort of male role in the relationship which she didn't want to take up. Additionally, she became worried that I was actually trans and just suppressing it, especially as I did not declare myself ""genderfluid"" until she helped me find that label, thinking that I had only settled on that as to suppress some sort of true desire to transition and please her. She has said in the past that she wouldn't be able to continue a relationship with me if I were trans, because I would no longer be the same person in her eyes... Though she is attracted to transwomen and to a lesser extent cis women, she is only attracted to them sexually and not romantically and thus doesn't see herself being in a relationship with anyone other than a cis male, specifically the cis male she thought I was and is now having to change her whole perception of. 

&amp;#x200B;

Back in the summer, after she brought up the idea of shaving my body hair and whether I would want to do it. I had only shaved my legs once before as a teenager, but I was anxious to try it again. I shaved my legs and kept up with it for a few weeks before she declared she did not like and missed the hair on my legs. She also made it clear she did not want me shaving any other parts of my body hair. This has been particularly distressing as I genuinely like the way having smooth skin feels. I feel like I could give up the clothes part more easily, but obviously my body hair or lack thereof isn't really something I can hide from my partner. I shaved my legs a few weeks ago and it upset her a lot and she made some disparaging comments that also upset me. So, I kind of just dropped the whole thing after that. 

&amp;#x200B;

I now feel comfortable in my genderfluidity and want to express it more and I have an idea in mind about how I would want to present myself in public (still male but with a feminine flair of sorts when the feeling is right, basically androgynous in many ways), but I feel like her push back as only made me more anxious and less certain. For so long, I've been ashamed of this part of myself but feel like I don't have to anymore. It's just hard because I feel like while I have found acceptance for myself, I don't know if my wife will find that same acceptance and her tolerance for it seems to be dwindling more and more each day. Some days, I just want to be able to throw on an outfit consisting of a slightly feminine women's top, skinny jeans and some cool gender neutral boots. But she has become increasingly weary of me even venturing out in any clothing she perceives has a ""feminine cut,"" unless it's absolutely for a special occasion going out outfit that calls for a bolder look. It feels like she has now taken the mantle of shame, and I hate that.

&amp;#x200B;

She helped me find a few mostly European clothing boutiques that have more fun and androgynous styled men's clothing. And while I've found tons of stuff I like on these sites, it's often more expensive and there's not the same ability to try it on with many of these stores not having U.S. based locations or at least locations near me.  I like the ability to go to the thrift store and try on all types of clothing, men or women's.

Plus, with my body type, it's much easier to find women's clothing that fits in any given store. I'm 6'2 but only 150lbs. So men's clothing can often be too baggy or too loose, unless I order harder to find sizing online or limit myself to the aforementioned pricey European stores. Although my wife has expressed that she would like for me to be more muscular, I really like my thin body. It's a bit of a source of pride for me, and I like clothing that shows it off or accentuates it. My wife is plus size though and also has expressed discomfort and some jealousy at me being able to fit into a much smaller size. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone else here had to deal with similar issues? How did you get through it, if at all? Is it worth questioning a relationship over your own perceived inability to fully express your gender duality or is it better to continue to compromise in hopes the person eventually opens up?

2019-01-09 19:37:20,aeafhy,7,1,"I feel like I have to be closeted about feeling gender fluid, which just makes it feel less... “real”, I guess. Like, it doesn’t exactly work when I’m the only one who knows and I don’t want to tell people. I wish I could do like a “practice run”, where if I don’t like it, it’s like nothing happened. I feel like I don’t have a safe space, I guess. I want to be referred to with female pronouns, but without telling people that, that becomes a lot harder. Dysphoric days don’t help matters.

People on the non binary sub suggested I check out over here, I’ve always had masculine and feminine interests since I was young. I could never really put a name on it though because I didn’t understand the concept of gender fluidity back then just all I knew was sometimes I felt like a girl and sometimes I felt like a boy. 

I’ve struggled with my gender issues for many years which has had me going through phases of suppressing my other side but over time I’ve realised I can’t keep hiding it anymore, it makes me too unhappy and I hate not being myself. 

Only a few people know about this part of me but I’m hoping to slowly let more and more people know. 

Just a question for everyone here though? When you change into the other personality is it like you’re still you just different or do you feel like you’re actually a seperate person? I’ve had people tell me that I’m basically a completely different person between both sides but I don’t even notice myself completely switching like they’ve said.

2019-01-11 04:47:03,aertqw,1,1,"Hey everyone! I'm new to this sub-reddit, so sorry if this kind of post has already been done to death, but I was hoping this might be a good way to learn more about the community and to better understand other people's experiences and become a better ally.

I guess a few things to start. First, I have identified as a male my whole life, and I still do. Second, I'm not aware of knowing any gender-fluid or transgender people. I don't avoid anyone for that reason, I've just never happened to meet someone who identifies that way, as far as I know. Third, while I don't personally have the experience so I have questions, I do NOT challenge the validity of gender fluidity. I hope none of my ignorance comes off as insensitive or downright offensive. If something I say offends anyone, please understand it was unintentional, but don't hesitate to let me know so that I can improve. I completely support anyone who identifies as gender-fluid, and I want everyone to live their best, happiest lives.

Onto the point of this (already overlong post), I have a few questions I was hoping someone with different experiences could help me understand.

1. How do you know that you are gender fluid? Is it at all similar to any kind of feeling someone who doesn't identify as gender fluid could understand?

2. When you realize you are gender fluid, is it from a physical, mental, or emotional sensation? Is it a mix? And is it different for everyone?

3. How do you know when you're gender fluid instead of just the gender you were biologically born into with a tendency for traits typically associated with the other gender? 

Again, I really hope none of the ignorance in those questions came of as insulting or argumentative. I'm not here to attack anyone or to start some kind of debate, I'm genuinely trying to better understand people's feelings so that I can be a better ally.

I'll be using female pronouns to refer to my partner as she's more comfortable with those at the moment

Anyways, I've been dating my partner for a while now and she's been getting more comfortable presenting more male lately and occasionally using male terms to refer to herself. She's described her gender as ""¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯"" on several occasions but doesn't really want to label herself in any strict way.

This morning we were talking about a friend of hers who's questioning their gender at the moment and I suggested administering the button test. (I'm sure y'all are familiar). She asked me what it was, and when I explained it, she responded with almost no hesitation that she'd rather a ""sort of genderfluid shapeshifter sort of deal"". I'm more familiar with binary trans responses, but I thought that might be a pretty indicative.

I'm trying to support her in any way I can, encouraging her when she's  nervous about presenting male, using the pronouns and gendering her correctly in context, etc. But, I'll admit it's kind of difficult to address it without coming across as pushy regarding gender stuff.

2019-01-19 22:27:07,ahr299,2,1,"Long story short, I was born female and grew up very much a tomboy. I don't hate being a woman sometimes, though I often wonder if I'd be happier as a man. But also kind of thankful I wasn't because I know I would've grown up to be my narcissistic, conservative, religious father. Ever since I started uni and exploring identities, I've discovered that I'm mostly attracted to women and sometimes others, and that I'm low key afraid of sex though not opposed to it. I've started coming to terms with the thought that I may have never thought of myself as a woman, but when I do feel my most feminine I hate thinking I could be anyone else if that makes sense. I've always just felt somewhere in-between.

So here I am just putting my thoughts out there so I can't deny them later as being fake or non-existent. 

I don't hate having been born a woman, and I don't dislike femininity. I sometimes wish I could be a man. I wish I could be more masculine and more androgynous. I really just fear what others would think. I just want to try to be me without fear.

I've thought about getting a binder and/or a packer for the days I feel most masculine. On those days I've found myself wearing men's boxer briefs around the house with a sock inside, and it makes me feel more like me. But if I sleep with it, I wake up hating myself. I've also had a complicated relationship with my chest because C-cups don't allow me to wear what I want to wear.

I've also had the thought of going by a more andro nickname after I graduate. And just being more andro in general because no one really needs to know what's going on in my pants, and I don't feel too strongly in any direction to really care how people see me as long as I feel like myself.

I guess a really big fear of mine is being seen as a transtrender, just here for attention.

She wasn't sure on how I would react or if I would still want to be with her because of this huge change. I told her I love her, I'm gonna stay with her regardless if she's a female or gender fluid, and I'm promised her I will do everything I can to help her and understand her. I fell in love with this girl for who she is as a person and I want her in my life regardless of such change. I'm reaching out for help because I'm very new to this type of situation. I will admit I'm a bit scared and I'm in no way an expert on this so I want to best understand it for her and our relationship. It's a big challenge for me and her but I'm determined to make it work. 

The general questions I have are:

1. Are there specific days like a pattern where she will feel like a male/female or are the days just random?
2. Would I still call her my girlfriend or would I use a different pronoun to introduce her to people because of her gender fluid?
3. How can I adjust myself more easily to her male side when it appears?
4. How can I better prepare ourselves emotionally for the change?
5. Would she make any body changes with her being genderfluid?

I can't think of anymore questions right now but I thank you all for helping out with this. It means the world to me! Any additional support or advice you can add would greatly help me!

I will admit I'm a bit scared and I'm in no way an expert on this so I want to best understand it for her and our relationship. It's a big challenge for me and her but I'm determined to make it work. \n\nThe general questions I have are:\n\n1. Are there specific days like a pattern where she will feel like a male/female or are the days just random?\n2. Would I still call her my girlfriend or would I use a different pronoun to introduce her to people because of her gender fluid?\n3. How can I adjust myself more easily to her male side when it appears?\n4. How can I better prepare ourselves emotionally for the change?\n5. Would she make any body changes with her being genderfluid?\n\nI can't think of anymore questions right now but I thank you all for helping out with this. It means the world to me! Any additional support or advice you can add would greatly help me!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  "", 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'My girlfriend just came out to me as Genderfluid', 'created': 1548049954.0}"
