Part of the problem is we have to be very selective for where we buy clothes. He’s 6’8” and slender. Most shirts need to be extra long to cover his bits and regular stores do not carry his pants size due to length. It’s extra hard to find femme clothes that fit and look good. Most things are just shapeless sacks that make him feel insecure make him look bigger than he is. Long dresses hit awkwardly and shorter dresses give a peep show. Also because he’s so tall he sticks out and just kinda want to start with baby steps.

2019-11-07 00:33:21,dspgp2,1,4,"It's been a couple of rocky months for me. I started doubting my gender around mid-september and started (more like ocasionally attempted) crossdressing. I thought that that was the end of it, i was just a cis male crossdresser, yay me.

Yeah, that didn't really last for long.

I'm gender-fluid, or at least i think i am. I say ""think"" because i clearly don't know what the fuck i am, and everytime i've tried to put a definitive label on myself i come out two weeks later and realize i'm not that either; this time i'm a lot more certain though. I mean, at least according to gender wiki, i'm a textbook case of genderfluidity. I wake up one day and feel perfectly fine and dandy in my regular ol' male body, i like my penis, my boyish charm and my voice, next day i feel this extreme, burning desire to shave every hair in my body, put on makeup and a dress and twirl around like an anime schoolgirl. I like to feel pretty, i like to look at myself in the mirror and feel like i look eye catching, i like the colors of the lipsticks i steal from my mom, i like my eyelashes to look long and thick, i love how the eye shadow makes my eyes pop and pierce people's souls... and then the next day I feel like a boy again, nothing out of place.

I started thinking about using a different name when i had my woman days, and i told my friends and they were really supportive and encouraging, buuuuuut...

They really don't get the chance to adress me with female pronouns or my other name, not when we're constantly surrounded with people who aren't privy to my secret. I don't really want to come out to my whole university (my country isn't exactly progressive... i'm scared that if everyone finds out i'll just be badgered by a bunch of people about what the fuck i am and i dont have the pacience to deal with that). Aside from that, i don't get to dress up that much... i still live with my parents and they're really catholic, really \*really\* catholic, so coming out to them is just... a can of worms that i'm not willing to open.

I don't have any safe space where i can dress up and be myself without having to hide in my bathroom just in case someone walks in and sees me as a woman and it's causing me some distress. I get this feeling in my chest, like the kind you get when you're really nervous, and my whole body feels warm, like the feeling you get right before you get goosebumps, and when i think about dressing up and presenting as a woman i get warmer and fuzzier, and i can't stop myself from cracking a smile like a dumbass (is this dysphoria? I can't tell). I want to present as a woman, i want people to call me by my new name and use female pronouns, i want to wear cute blouses and put on a coat of makeup to go to my university and i want people to see me and say ""Wow, there goes that girl."" And then i just go back to man-mode and nothing feels out of place.

The thing is, when i'm in woman-mode, presenting female is all i can think about. I study medicine, zoning out in class a couple of times isnt a bad thing, but zoning out \*all the time\* because i'm thinking about how i would look if i tried using earrings is really bad...

This is mostly just to vent about my whole experience, but if there was a Tl;DR to it i guess it would be that the way things are right now, i can't present myself as a female. Not without dealing with a lot of shit and possibly even getting into trouble with my university (it's a possibility, though i'm not sure how likely it is). I dont feel bad presenting male, i'm comfortable with it and don't want to stop doing it, I just wish i could present female with the same casualness i present male, because it's invading my brain and i have to find a way of calming this anxiety i get from not being able to show myself how i really am inside.",genderfluid,"Recently came out as GF and feel very anxious about some issues, help?",1573112001.0,"{'created_utc': 1573086801, 'id': 'dspgp2', 'num_comments': 1, 'score': 4, 'selftext': 'It\'s been a couple of rocky months for me.

I like to feel pretty, i like to look at myself in the mirror and feel like i look eye catching, i like the colors of the lipsticks i steal from my mom, i like my eyelashes to look long and thick, i love how the eye shadow makes my eyes pop and pierce people\'s souls... and then the next day I feel like a boy again, nothing out of place.\n\nI started thinking about using a different name when i had my woman days, and i told my friends and they were really supportive and encouraging, buuuuuut...\n\nThey really don\'t get the chance to adress me with female pronouns or my other name, not when we\'re constantly surrounded with people who aren\'t privy to my secret. I don\'t really want to come out to my whole university (my country isn\'t exactly progressive... i\'m scared that if everyone finds out i\'ll just be badgered by a bunch of people about what the fuck i am and i dont have the pacience to deal with that). Aside from that, i don\'t get to dress up that much... i still live with my parents and they\'re really catholic, really \\*really\\* catholic, so coming out to them is just... a can of worms that i\'m not willing to open.\n\nI don\'t have any safe space where i can dress up and be myself without having to hide in my bathroom just in case someone walks in and sees me as a woman and it\'s causing me some distress. I get this feeling in my chest, like the kind you get when you\'re really nervous, and my whole body feels warm, like the feeling you get right before you get goosebumps, and when i think about dressing up and presenting as a woman i get warmer and fuzzier, and i can\'t stop myself from cracking a smile like a dumbass (is this dysphoria? I can\'t tell). I want to present as a woman, i want people to call me by my new name and use female pronouns, i want to wear cute blouses and put on a coat of makeup to go to my university and i want people to see me and say ""Wow, there goes that girl."" And then i just go back to man-mode and nothing feels out of place.\n\nThe thing is, when i\'m in woman-mode, presenting female is all i can think about. I study medicine, zoning out in class a couple of times isnt a bad thing, but zoning out \\*all the time\\* because i\'m thinking about how i would look if i tried using earrings is really bad...\n\nThis is mostly just to vent about my whole experience, but if there was a Tl;DR to it i guess it would be that the way things are right now, i can\'t present myself as a female. Not without dealing with a lot of shit and possibly even getting into trouble with my university (it\'s a possibility, though i\'m not sure how likely it is). I dont feel bad presenting male, i\'m comfortable with it and don\'t want to stop doing it, I just wish i could present female with the same casualness i present male, because it\'s invading my brain and i have to find a way of calming this anxiety i get from not being able to show myself how i really am inside.', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'Recently came out as GF and feel very anxious about some issues, help?', 'created': 1573112001.0}"

I have figured out I am trans. FtM transgender. I noticed a pattern with the genders I believed I was: they were all masculine.

Let's review: first I thought I was trans, them a demiboy, then genderfluid, now I know I'm trans.

What had happened was I kept trying to say in my head: ""nah, you're still a *little* feminine, *riiiiiiight*? Yeah, let's fake it till we make it!"" 

Because of my mom expressing that she thinks I am a cisgender female, I tried tricking myself into feeling female. ""Fake it till you make it"" essentially.

I asked him if he was gay, or transgender, or confused? He said he’s definitely bisexual but a bit confused about his gender and refuses to talk about it any more. 
Okay fine, this has continued, whenever I try to talk about it he refuses.

When we got home he made the offhanded remark that he could definitely do it again and when I asked for clarification, he said dressing feminine. I didnt think anything of it because some of his clothes have came from the women's section when we shop. He came out to me on monday as genderfluid. I didnt think I'd have the reaction that I have had. I feel like a complete hypocrite, because this is hard for me to hear.

I've felt so good about our relationship since then. Last saturday we went to a costume party and we did a gender swapped pirate theme. It was fun and we had a great time. When we got home he made the offhanded remark that he could definitely do it again and when I asked for clarification, he said dressing feminine. I didnt think anything of it because some of his clothes have came from the women's section when we shop. He came out to me on monday as genderfluid. I didnt think I'd have the reaction that I have had. I feel like a complete hypocrite, because this is hard for me to hear. I still love him the same, and neither one of us cares about pronouns, so that hasn't changed. I'm just scared about what this means for our relationship. I love and support him no matter what, but I've been crying intermittently since then. I dont want him to feel invalidated, but this feels like such a big change when it really shouldn't be. I go through moments of total happiness because I feel happy that I can make him so happy. We've discussed a lot of things, but for some reason I'm having a hard time with it all. Am I being irrational, or is this a transitional thing? Any advice is appreciated. I've been doing my best to make him feel validated about everything, and I want to help him as much as possible.

I am a 31 year old male, living in a not very accepting place. Luckily for me, I am very comfortable with my masculinity. I love it in fact. I am a bodybuilder (and pretty good at it too), and strength athlete. I embrace, and love both of these things, and they are both things I am passionate about. 

This is not a compensation, or anything like that either. Growing up as a child, I always wanted to dress as a girl, play with dolls, wear makeup, etc. People always thought I was gay(well, still do haha), and dont understand that I really would rather do ""girl activities"" with the girls, than ""boy activities"" with the boys. This is still the case today. It took into my early twenties to really embrace, and enjoy aspects of my masculinity. Which I do, greatly. My genitals, my physicality, my intimate life with women. These are all things I cherish greatly(I dont know if that sounds dumb). 

Sorry, I'm jumping all over the place, but I want to just get my thoughts out as they come. Everyone has always thought I was gay. Even my parents. Everyone I try to talk to about any of these things goes there immediately, and is unconvincible otherwise. I absolutely believe that sexuality exists on a spectrum, dont get me wrong. I have lived an, unfortunately, promiscuous life. I have been sexually assaulted by both males, and female subjects, I have worked in the sex trade with both male and female clients, and I have had so many thousands of sexual experiences that I am fully comfortable, and without a doubt, able to say that I am not sexually attracted to masculine physicality, or masculine genitalia. 

I actually have a lot of trouble connecting with males in general, and can only really ever connect with females. This has been since childhood as well, as I did not connect with the masculine aspects of my father, and wanted to spend time with my mother instead. This leads me to so many problems, as I also struggle with boundaries(this is a separate issue, that I am taking steps to deal with), as my relationships with women often turn very inappropriate very fast, and before I know it... I'm now in a relationship with somebody I connected with because our genitals work together, and we are attracted to each other. Then they overlap, and coexist, and I break everyone's hearts, and just feel dead inside. I dont deserve any sympathy here, so dont think I ask for it. I often get labeled as a player, and people think I am compensating for my closeted homosexuality, when there is no compensation, or closeted homosexuality. Just seeking connection, and needing to understand boundaries. ANYWAY, forget this whole paragraph... that's not what this is about. 

I love physical beauty, and I love being ""beautiful"". I am not vain, and I have never, ever judged, or treated anybody in any different sort of a way based on their beauty that I perceive. I embrace my masculine beauty, and a little bit of the feminine side as well. 

The problem is, this feminine side of me feels so buried. I would not be accepted in my community, at my job, in my family, or in my personal relationships if I acted how I want to act. I dont even believe that my feminine side is in ""conflict"" with my masculine side. I want more of it, but I want to embrace my masculine side as well, and continue to develop it. I love wearing a tank top, rocking a couple days of stubble, shaving my head, throwing some boots on, and heading out the door. I will always do this, and enjoy it a lot. I will also always enjoy wearing a suit, and dressing in formal male clothing. 

I would also absolutely love to go get my makeup all done, nails done, body all shaved, high heels, wig, and just be comfortable like that. I have plans to try cross-dressing in the very near future. 

The thing is.. neither of those are my ideal expression. I dont want to go ""back and forth"". I dont want to wear dresses, skirts, bras, panties, etc... but I do want to wear girls pants and shirts, as well as male pants and shirts. While my choices would be mostly masculine, I want to be able to wear whichever I like, and with whatever I like. I want to wear eye makeup. I want to have my nails done. 

I want to embrace masculinity, and femininity fully. I dont even really know what I am asking anymore, or if any of this even makes sense. Please dont post anything inflammatory, as I dont think I will take it very well. I'm just trying to clarify my own identity a little bit I suppose.

2019-11-10 12:15:55,duaqok,2,1,"I've been having a fun ride on the gender rollercoaster for a while now. I'm AMAB, and a couple years ago, my shell started to crack, mostly thanks to the lovely people of subreddits like /r/egg_irl or /r/traa. That kicked off a period of four or so months when transitioning was all I could think about. I would swing from intense optimism thinking about the possibilities to intense pessimism thinking of just how impossible it all seemed. I was in a foreign country that wasn't exactly enlightened about trans issues, I didn't speak the language, and I didn't really have any native contacts I felt like I could approach about this. So, I just kind of played it off as best I could, and eventually those feelings cooled. 

This left me in a bit of a lurch as far as my identity went. I still called myself a trans woman, but I no longer really wanted to put myself through the struggles of transitioning. A little voice in the back of my head whispered ""maybe you're just a cis guy after all"".

I didn't like that voice. I still don't really like that voice. I'm not sure why. Up until that first bout of gender fuckery, I'd never really experienced any real distress over gender before. I had never really taken any real joy in being a boy before that either, mind. I took a quiet, secret pride in things that set me apart from a stereotypical guy, but it had never been a crisis of identity for me before. 

So, when I did have that first crisis of gender identity, it threw me for a loop. I had no strong feelings tying me to malehood, so it wasn't a huge issue for me to cut ties with it, at least as far as my own thoughts went. When those feelings of euphoria over the idea of being a woman started to fade, I still didnt have any feelings of euphoria over being a guy to replace it. Being a guy was just ""fine"". It was easier than being a woman, easier than transitioning. All of that was hard and painful and certain to make things difficult to impossible for me. Being a guy, on the other hand, was just existing. It was just the status quo. 

So, I just occupied this space mentally for the rest of the year. This weird dysphoric/euphoric phase was the first time I had ever felt strongly about my gender, so I still thought of myself as a trans woman, but I had no desire to transitioning, and I was okay with that. I wasn't thrilled about it, but I was okay with it. 

And then it happened all over again, almost a year to the day of my first big gender crisis. I was trans and I wanted to transition so much. My actual living situation hadn't changed, so I was still crippled in terms of what I could actually do to act on these feelings, but, oh lords, the feelings were back. 

Once again, I spent months obsessing over my gender. I made plans, I even came out to a few people who I knew would be supportive. 

And then the feelings faded again. It was around this point I first really thought ""maybe I'm genderfluid"". I had always been sympathetic to the idea that gender wasn't static and that it would probably shift for a lot of people over the course of their lives, but it had never been something I thought would apply to me. 

Honestly, I didnt want it to apply to me. At that time, I found the thought of granting validity to this alleged male side of me distasteful. I didn't want to be male some of the time. I wanted to be a woman. At least, that was my emotional reaction when I tried to reason out my weird gender yo-yo-ing. A little later, I found the term genderflux, and I picked that up for a while. 

I liked the idea of being genderflux a lot more. It gave me a term to describe these weird fluctuations without actually having to say ""I'm a guy"" at all. But I still wasn't sure if it fit perfectly. I felt apathetic during these periods of lull in my gender crises. I didn't feel like the whole concept of gender rubbed against me the wrong way, I just didn't feel strongly about gender at all. I remembered feeling strongly about being a woman, but i just had nothing in the moment. 

But, genderflux was the label I carried, loosely, until like two days ago. I'm currently in one of my weird apathetic moods, after some yo-yo-ing around. I just had this thought of ""I'm a guy right now, and that's okay."" And it was okay. It felt like acknowledging a truth I hadn't wanted to acknowledge up until now. My previous reluctance to think of myself as genderfluid wasn't there. It was actually a bit of a relief, honestly, to be able to address myself during my time of apathy without feeling vaguely guilty over it.

So, here I sit now, typing this all out. This wasn't really the post I meant to type. I just wanted to give a little bit of background before asking when you k.ew you were gender fluid, but you got this whole essay anyways. 

Writing this out, I'm still not really sure where exactly I would place myself. There's definitely some level of genderflux going on, but I'm still not sure how sort my own feelings out. Are the times when I'm not in crisis just normal agender times, or is it just me actually being a guy and returning to the status quo. If I'm fine (in an apathetic sense) with living as a guy, is that just some weak agender mood, or is that just a status quo being a guy thing? Honestly, I have no clue, and writing all this mess out just muddled it more for me.

So, I'm hoping some of your own stories might help me find my own way. When did you know you were genderfluid? What does it feel like if you're in a mindset of your AGAB? If you're genderflux or agender, what does that feel like?

I had always been sympathetic to the idea that gender wasn\'t static and that it would probably shift for a lot of people over the course of their lives, but it had never been something I thought would apply to me. \n\nHonestly, I didnt want it to apply to me. At that time, I found the thought of granting validity to this alleged male side of me distasteful. I didn\'t want to be male some of the time. I wanted to be a woman. At least, that was my emotional reaction when I tried to reason out my weird gender yo-yo-ing. A little later, I found the term genderflux, and I picked that up for a while. \n\nI liked the idea of being genderflux a lot more. It gave me a term to describe these weird fluctuations without actually having to say ""I\'m a guy"" at all. But I still wasn\'t sure if it fit perfectly. I felt apathetic during these periods of lull in my gender crises. I didn\'t feel like the whole concept of gender rubbed against me the wrong way, I just didn\'t feel strongly about gender at all. I remembered feeling strongly about being a woman, but i just had nothing in the moment. \n\nBut, genderflux was the label I carried, loosely, until like two days ago. I\'m currently in one of my weird apathetic moods, after some yo-yo-ing around. I just had this thought of ""I\'m a guy right now, and that\'s okay."" And it was okay. It felt like acknowledging a truth I hadn\'t wanted to acknowledge up until now. My previous reluctance to think of myself as genderfluid wasn\'t there. It was actually a bit of a relief, honestly, to be able to address myself during my time of apathy without feeling vaguely guilty over it.\n\nSo, here I sit now, typing this all out. This wasn\'t really the post I meant to type. I just wanted to give a little bit of background before asking when you k.ew you were gender fluid, but you got this whole essay anyways. \n\nWriting this out, I\'m still not really sure where exactly I would place myself. There\'s definitely some level of genderflux going on, but I\'m still not sure how sort my own feelings out. Are the times when I\'m not in crisis just normal agender times, or is it just me actually being a guy and returning to the status quo. If I\'m fine (in an apathetic sense) with living as a guy, is that just some weak agender mood, or is that just a status quo being a guy thing? Honestly, I have no clue, and writing all this mess out just muddled it more for me.\n\nSo, I\'m hoping some of your own stories might help me find my own way. When did you know you were genderfluid? What does it feel like if you\'re in a mindset of your AGAB? If you\'re genderflux or agender, what does that feel like?\n\nThank you so much for reading &lt;3', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'When did you know?', 'created': 1573413355.0}"

2019-11-13 05:02:20,dvmqzh,2,1,"So, my favorite part of dressing feminine is painting my toes and wearing cute shoes. It just makes me feel cute and like myself.

My first girlfriend (my ex-ex) way back in high school was super into nail polish; it was her and her mom's hobby. They had hundreds of bottles and she always had a different color/design every week. She also LOVED shoes. For graduation her mom got her a pair of Valentinos and she just about died lol. 

We used to be best friends, we told each other a lot of personal things even after we'd broken up. We still are kinda, but now that we go to separarte colleges, and as most people will find in their own lives, are finding it difficult to keep in touch at the same level that we used to. 

In our conversations she's mentioned one of her close friends, we'll call him ""D,"" and he's very openly gay, which makes me feel like she'd like be more cool with finding out that I'm actually very feminine.

At the same time, it's SO out of character compared to how she remembers me that I'm slightly worried that she might tell maybe 1 or 2 friends, which might lead to a chain reaction of people knowing. I'm not sure I'd wanna have this conversation with some people.

The reason I wanna tell her is because really soon I'll have an opportunity to go to an event that's nail polish related, but I don't want to go alone. I KNOW she'd find it fun/cool. But also if I just invited her without any context, she'd obviously find it strange that I was inviting her to do something nail polish related.

I am looking for diverse individuals to complete an online IRB approved survey that will take approximately 15 to 20-minutes. To be included in the study, you must be at least 18 years of age, possess English proficiency, and be living in the United States. The survey has been approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB; STUDY00144682) at the University of Kansas.

The current study is a part of my dissertation research, which examines the relationship between multiple diverse identities and help-seeking intentions for mental health concerns. The study possesses minimal risk and has the opportunity to directly benefit you by obtaining mental health and mental health service resources provided at the end of the online survey. Further, we believe that the information obtained from this study will help us gain a better understanding of how diverse groups perceive and intend to seek mental health services.

The survey is available at the link below:

I've been running into a relationship conflict, and I was wondering if anyone else in the community here had any similar experiences or advice. I'm AFAB and currently identify as genderfluid, and I definitely have fluctuations in my attitudes, pronouns, and presentation. I've been very happy with coming to accept my gender identity, but the problem is that my long-term boyfriend is only really attracted to me when I'm in femme moods. 

While my femme moods do happen frequently, I just find myself feeling sad that my straight partner isn't attracted to me when I'm in non-binary or masc territory. I thought this would be fine so long as my partner still really valued me as a person during these times, but I'm worried that it won't be enough. It's true that attraction comes and goes in relationships over time, but for some reason this feels different to me.

Has anyone here had similar experiences? How did things work out for you? Obviously the circumstances are a bit different in each relationship, but I'd still like to hear from y'all.

Thanks awesome people,

So much so I’m wondering if this is something I can pursue? Has anyone else ever gelt this way, without fully transitioning? Is having breast surgery even an option without a full transition ?', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'Had anyone else gelt this way about wanting needing to have breasts??', 'created': 1575149055.0}"
