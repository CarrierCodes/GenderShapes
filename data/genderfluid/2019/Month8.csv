I am a male, 37 years old, married, doing well in my career and living a normal life to an outsider. 

But undisclosed to anyone, I carry a feminine side within me. A side that is soft, soothing, submissive and adorable. Secretly I wish I would have been a woman, and I guess that life would have more spontaneity and authenticity than my current life. I spend a lot of time daydreaming, imagining myself as a beautiful and intelligent woman who plays a major role in bringing good to the world. 

But, I do not think I am a full-scale transgender either. Because there are times when I am comfortable being a male and enjoying that. So I think both identities are indivisible parts of my psyche. So I think the genderfluid title suits me.

I am surrounded by a conservative family and society and so for the time being I do not have anyone to whom I can ""come out"" and share my feelings in the physical world I live in. I hope to relieve that pain a little by pouring my heart here. 

My body is hairless (less facial hair and chest hair) and smooth. If I cross-dress and put a wig (which I had done only a few times secretly), I would pass as a fairly attractive woman. I am concerned about my thinning hair though :( 

At school and College, I did not use to be much sporty like my peers. I was a bookworm(which I still am),writer and nerd. There were times when I was ridiculed for not being manly enough, and even being teased that I am a girl by bullies, and if I am honest, in spite of the embarrassment felt, I sometimes wished if I could have been a real girl! 

My sexuality is straight. It is women with whom I love to have sex. There was a time when I doubted whether I was gay because I had daydreams of men making love to me while I am in a female role, but then based on further insights it became clear to me that it is not the men who turns me on but the idea of my own femininity. The men in my daydreams just acted as a factor that validates my imagined femininity. However I have a wish to somehow befriending a ""dream man"" who would understand and respect my gender fluidity, who would not demand sex from me, but would still be affectionately romantic with my feminine side, someone to whom I can open up my heart when I feel feminine, but at the someone who understands that I am not always in the feminine mode and respects that. It might be unrealistic to even hope for that, but I do carry that wish in my heart. 

Speaking in general, I have a yearning to be accepted, respected for who I really am, and if possible be on the receiving side of affection. I yearn to be told that I am okay and perhaps receive a hug. Not sure if I am too old for that :(

2019-08-08 01:27:08,cneqdw,0,1,"So. Main (host) diagnosed with traumagenic DID by a therapist almost four years ago at age 35.   Rampant amnesia across my history but I've managed to piece it together via stories from friends and also just looking back over social media (Myspace was a minefield). As well as school yearbooks, etc.

I've posted a bit on DID forums but I'm trying to get a bit more information from other sources, because I'm still rather unsure and I don't want to offend anyone at all. My kids are all just barely adult, and I know from them that there are social norms and etiquette that I don't know. I don't want to or mean to offend anyone.

Basically I present as cisfemale. I use female pronouns, a female first name, and dress stereotypical female. I'm married to a man. But I am not just me, and of my adult alters, most are female and are either straight or bi.

However, I have two male alters. One is elderly and isn't interested in anything sexual or romantic at all, so far as I know. The other is male, bisexual, currently considers himself to be about 23, and while he first appeared when I was 7, his ascendence when the body was mid20s led to two years of binding, pixie cuts, and asking to be called by a masculine variation of the birth name.

He still presents, sometimes, and is a part of my psyche that I don't know how to make happy. I want to, but there are definite barriers with my current life.

So does that mean I am genderfluid? Or does the DID mean I'm not and it's just part of my diagnosis, this sense of being not one or the other, but either depending? 

I guess when you really get down to it, I am looking for validation. Can I, this middle aged woman body, identify as fluid because he comes out periodically and makes us a guy? Or do I not fit here and belong elsewhere? He's still a part of me/us. Sorry if this is the wrong sub or I offended anyone.

2019-08-10 22:45:51,coou7q,4,4,"Hello, Im AFAB, I identify as gender fluid and came out to most people maybe two months ago. At that time I decided I wanted to get myself and others close to me used to using different pronouns. For instance I use Zizi instead of Aunt and ZaZa instead of mommy (I dont have children but I refer to myself as that to my beloved pets lol 🤪) And my husdband refers to me as his other half. And we all try not to say she or her. BUT I have found that the people I have asked to use these different pronouns ""slip up"" often...including myself sometimes lol. I mean ive been a she for nearly 29 years before coming out. My issue is that i dont want to be difficult and i dont want it to be awkward. Im not necessarily offended by she but I like the idea of using genderfluid pronouns. Do I keep trying to make it a thing or do I just stay with she.

At that time I decided I wanted to get myself and others close to me used to using different pronouns. For instance I use Zizi instead of Aunt and ZaZa instead of mommy (I dont have children but I refer to myself as that to my beloved pets lol 🤪) And my husdband refers to me as his other half. And we all try not to say she or her. BUT I have found that the people I have asked to use these different pronouns ""slip up"" often...including myself sometimes lol. I mean ive been a she for nearly 29 years before coming out. My issue is that i dont want to be difficult and i dont want it to be awkward. Im not necessarily offended by she but I like the idea of using genderfluid pronouns. Do I keep trying to make it a thing or do I just stay with she.

&amp;#x200B;

So about me, i am a 30 yo man. I never thought i was a woman or something. I am attracted to women.

&amp;#x200B;

However, i have a very big issue with my penis. I know it's attached to me, i want it to be attached to me, but it feels like it isn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

Weirdly enough, i've had sex for 10 years now but never did i even notice that i don't feel ANYTHING during sex or ejaculation. I was just going along with it, making sure the woman feels good.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't actually feel my penis, and it's like i don't have any object permanence with it - if it goes into a woman it's like i lost it or it's no longer mine. I understand it might sound weird, but it's like i don't feel it's mine.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, if i were to stick my hand in the sand and move it or clench my fist, i could feel all the action with my hand and i will have some spatial awareness of where my hand is. This does NOT happen with my penis, it feels like i am in some sort of limbo when i have sex.

&amp;#x200B;

Writing about it made me realize i don't feel my penis even when it's flaccid or something, i can only feel my penis if i touch it with my hands or thighs or whatever. I can't, for the lack of a better word, feels things WITH my penis.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to masturbate and watch a lot of porn so i stopped that because i think it may be related to it.

I understand transgender. I've seen the research, seen the pain, and know it to be real. But gender fluidity has always confused me. Are you really a different gender each day as a trans person would be? 

For example, say you have a male body. When you are feeling female, is it that you are female in the brain (and thus hate or feel uncomfortable in the male body) or is it that you feel more feminine but can still be happy in your body?

That said, I'm less honed in on what exactly that means for me. Right now, I'm identifying (for my benefit, more than anything) as genderfluid, transfemme.

I know I'm not a cis man. I know I've had thoughts off and on about being a girl my whole life. But I also don't hate everything about my male body like I think some trans folks do. I'm not sure if I ""think and feel like a man"" because I only have myself as a true point of reference. While I'm not really comfortable calling myself a ""man"", I also don't know that I feel comfortable (at least not yet) with the term ""woman"" either. But call me ""dude"", ""guy"", ""chick"", ""gal"" and I'm cool with it. I think I might want to transition, but I don't necessarily feel this driving urge to go go go like some folks do.

So I'm trying to figure out for myself if I'm REALLY genderfluid (or some other ""not quite this, not quite that"") or if I'm just holding onto the male-ness because it's familiar and safe.

2019-08-24 15:02:53,cuug07,2,3,"Hi, r/genderfluid! 


So, as the title suggests, I've got some questions about being genderfluid. I personally have been secretly struggling with what I identify as for a long time, about two days ago, I finally told some very close friends and they've said that Genderfluid sounds like it fits what I'm describing. I have been looking into it as much as I can, reading up on it, thinking it through in my head, and I also feel that it very accurately describes me. Though, I've got some questions about it. 


1. What does Genderfluid really mean to you? Like,if you were asked to describe what Genderfluid is, what would you say? 


2. Do you have to have both dysphoria and euphoria to be Genderfluid? I'm not sure if I've experienced dysphoria (if I have, it's not nearly as severe as I hear about it being for other people), though I do know I've experienced euphoria. 


3. How fast is too fast? Like, is finding a label that you think fits you in a few days too fast? I kind of feel like I'm going too fast with all this because some other friends I have who had to reevaluate their gender took months/years to figure out what they wanted to label themselves/identify as. I do very strongly feel that Genderfluid is accurate to how I've felt for years now, though. 


I feel much better going by they/them rather than she/her and feel that those pronouns fit me better. There's some days where I feel really feminine, some where I feel really masculine, and some days it's just kind of like ""Eh, I just exist"". I have looked at other identities, and I feel that Genderfluid is what fits me best. I came here to ask these questions just as part of really looking into this identity and making sure it's for me before taking any bigger steps.

2019-08-25 14:30:49,cv96iy,7,5,"Ok, this is my first post so I'm not sure how to go about it, excuse me in advance for the mini-novel. I just recently started to come to terms with my gender identity, although I knew I am not a man since I was like 15, that's 12 years ago. It started in the silliest way, with a Halloween costume, I and a few friends dressed as women, and I still remember I felt right, like never before that. I already had long hair since I was a kid, and I was never interested in boy hobbies and play, but I never thought about it much. But that night was so amazing. I started wearing makeup and nail polish on a daily base, it was the goth fase, and I encountered so much hostility in my home town that it broke me. I also have borderline personality disorder and at the time I was experimenting a lot with drugs, so that plus the beatings I was getting on a weekly basis made me forget that part of me to survive. I was also a fervent catholic (strange I know) and that made me so ashamed of myself I started to cut myself as punishment. One of the most burning memories is of a very close friend of mine, after I kissed a guy on a party he came to me and said he'll hit me if he sees me doing something like that ever again. I just accepted it as normal, for years I didn't even ask myself what's going on with me, mostly because of fear of rejection. I passed 10 years of severe depression, although I stopped using drugs, I mostly had a job, my life was kinda taking a turn for the better but I was frozen in that miserable state and couldn't move an inch. At 20yo I got out of a seriously f**ked up relationship and for years i was alone, thinking who would ever want to be with such a human wreck, and after I tried to get a relationship going, she slapped me with the statement: you're not man enough for me. That's the last straw that cracked it all again. I was so depressed that every little stupid thing would make me cry, I would wake up crying, I even had to quit my job because I couldn't function properly anymore. Then it all came back to me, and I started questioning myself again. I'm still not sure who I am becoming, a lot of the homophobia and transphobia from my surroundings still sticks to me, but I finally started again being who I am. I had to change country six months ago to be able to do that, but even though at the moment I am alone as never before I am the happiest I have been in more than ten years. I can finally wear nail polish and make up even though I am visibly male, my roommates and a few colleagues who I came out to are supportive (it's such a pleasant surprise) and after the summer when the workload is lighter I want to start seeing a gender therapist. I don't know for now how far it goes, am I transfeminin, nonbinary, demigirl, all those words seem so confusing tbh, but I know I feel better than ever. Sorry for the rant, this was written in the fire of the moment, after lurking on reddit for a while, all of you made me finally feel like I'm not an abomination, thanks for that.

I thought on and off for years about possibly being full FTM trans, but dismissed it because there were times I definitely felt female and feminine. I also dismissed a lot of the masculine/male feelings because I was raised mostly around and by men, thus being a little tomboy. It wasn't until more recently that I realized it's not just being a tomboy, but actual ""some days if I could flip and switch and be biologically male, I would"", as well as highly considering HRT.

I was stressed to come out because unlike my sexuality, this wasn't something that was actually normalized growing up, nor have I really realized being fluid until recently. The one person I thought would give me all the support and love, and say I'm here for you no matter what was my best friend - we're close enough that we default to calling each other ""sister"" (to the point I do this with my biological brother, and he had to learn who I kept talking about, 'cause he knows I don't have a bio sister, and he wasn't married at the time.) She's always been super supportive of the LGBTQ+ community, will vocally fight for people in the community, and it's something we talk about frequently.   
But she didn't react how I thought she would.

She said because she's never heard me talk about it before, it had to just be a phase and even went as far as to accuse me of doing it to ""fit in"" with my new friends. I posted my coming out on *all* my social media, places where I didn't and still don't have the friends she was accusing me of trying to fit in with.

I am in a relationship with an assigned boy for seven years now. 

Our wedding is scheduled for next year, and it has just experienced a real challenge.  To know that he has always (to my knowledge) spoken of himself in feminine during certain periods (what was attributed to his dyslexia, nvm)
and that now, after long research and long questioning, he is assuming genderfluid privately.

I do my best to support him, I love him whatever he is, but as you can read, using the right pronouns is complicated (we do not have ""it"" or ""they"" anything official or elegant in French, he himself also resigns)

I sent this to a few friends who I came out to and it was in a lot of separate messages so my apologies in advance for really bad formatting, bad grammar and spelling, and ranting in spots.

Here goes:

i found that now that i'm living on my own and am away from my family

and don't have to be forced to act how people think guys are supposed to act

i think i've been floating more in the realm of non-binary most of the time

i still get waves of feeling feminine and wanting to release my inner fem

but the waves of masculine feelings are subsiding and i've been just floating in between

i haven't come out yet and don't know how to

like to my roommates

but at the same time i really want to because i fucking hate having to act and dress and do everything a certain way

i fucking hate how people have gendered clothes and behaviors and been like ""oh well boys can't do this or wear that because that's for girls"" and same goes the other way

like thanks society for forcing me to hide myself while growing up and being forced to live in fucking constant fear and anxiety and stress because i was told i had to do shit a certain way

like

even when going to buy new clothes and shit i get weird looks and shit

if i want to try on this dress then let me try on this dress in peace

so what if i look like a dude

yall dont give other girls dirty looks for trying on guys clothes

why does it have to be so one sided

like if a woman is wearing sweatpants or a sports coat nobody bats an eye

but the second someone in the closet goes out and gets a dress to try on or anything fem and wears it in public

the whole world stops and it seems like everyone sees them as a weirdo and all shit hits the fan

women wearing suits in and shit is normal

why can't guys wearing dresses or skirts or skinny jeans and shit  be normal also

and as if that wasn't bad enough

if a guy goes into the womens underwear department

OOOOOOH LORD

GOD HELP US IF A GUY ENJOYS WEARING THEM BECAUSE SOME PAIRS ARE ACTUALLY MORE COMFORTABLE

another struggle im facing here is how everyone's like ""yea its a safe space dont be afraid to open up and talk to us about anything""

um excuse me do you know whats its like having to hide your true self for your whole life and be in constant fear of being judged or bullied because of that

i've already been bullied as a kid for shit

that's why i get really uncomfortable talking about some shit because my only memories of it are being fucking bullied for it

i did not expect this to turn out like this

im just really

frustrated

and feel lost sometimes

i have so much more to rant on about but i really don't know if it makes sense or anything

i haven't been in a class with any girls in like 4 years so i don't really know anyone and i also haven't come out to any girls here so i think it would be really weird and uncomfortable if all of a sudden i just went all fem and nobody knew why

like my friends over the summer knew because i came out to them and i was open

so it was a little easier

i was able to be with people who supported me and i came out to in class and it was a little less uncomfortable

but now everything is back to square one and i liked coming out because i had less anxiety

but now that im in this new place with different people, i'm back in the closet because im scared to come out again

i'm like a fucking turtle

come out when i feel safe and comfortable

and right back into hiding when i'm not comfortable

i feel safe here

don't get me wrong

but it's just that i feel weird seeing some people who the last time i saw was in middle school and all of a sudden im really different and this shit uncomfortable

sorry if this is in a weird format or if it jumps around a lot, i had so many thoughts and crap in my head that i needed to get out and i didn't think of formatting or flow.

I've identified as genderfluid for years now, AFAB, and I've been content to use my gender-neutral shortened first name regardless of how my fluidity presents day to day. I'm lucky that I rarely have blatant dysphoria, and when I do, it's usually bottom-centric. My chest is rarely a problem. Today, that changed in a hard way.

I have a binder because I generally feel comfortable presenting either way. I'm middling most of the time. Some days I'm markedly more femme, others, slightly more masc.

   I guess there are many ways to express our different gender beliefs.  And often times it takes years to find out where we fit in on the gender spectrum.  Unfortunately it is a difficult journey and in most cultures a very painful one.  For the most part people don't see the need to explore any gender options and go with the fact that if you have a penis you are a boy and if you have a vagina you are a girl and accept all the trapping society imposes on you once you accept your condition as such.  So if you take this path and not buck society, you do avoid a lot of ridicule and suffering but for the most part, this path doesn't seem to lead to happiness and I strongly suspect you experience all the pain and suffering you tried to avoid by not being aware of your gender spectrum opportunities.  Because gender is just one aspect of self that needs to be explored and materialized in a way that you can live with yourself as well as relate to the society you were born into.  Mostly I try to avoid grossing people out because of my gender fluid attitude and have discovered the virtual world as a vehicle to fully express both sides of my gender issue without causing a lot of grief to myself or others.  Through awareness and un-attachment to how others rate me, I have actually been having fun with my gender fluid condition.

2019-08-30 16:50:04,cxjkgh,2,2,"Hi,
I've been in transition for about 5 years now and known I was trans for about 6, and since I've become aware that I'm trans, I've noticed my gender just straight up changing sometimes? Not on any regular basis, I can spend a year as typical binary trans girl, and then I wake up one morning and my gender, my dysphoria, what pronouns I like, how I want to express my gender is completely different. I became much more aware of this pattern about a year ago when I went from binary trans girl to completely neutral pretty much instantly, suddenly she/her pronouns felt invalidating so I started going by they/them, I became dysphoric about my breasts and started wearing a binder for frankly unhealthy amounts of time, and I had to cut my hair which I had been growing out for over a year, stop wearing dresses in favor of button down shirts and bowties just because of how at odds my presentation felt with my gender and how much I hated being referred to with she/her pronouns, I couldn't even stand being called cute because it seemed too feminine (I know cute isn't necessary a girl-only adjective, that's just how I felt at the time).
Fast forward to about 6 months ago and suddenly my gender shifts again! To something like 65-80% girl. I felt euphoric about my breasts again, started dressing more traditionally femininely and started growing out my hair again because suddenly I hated it being short and I switched my pronouns back to she/her.
This is just the most obvious recent example, this has happened a lot before and I do not understand it, and frankly I am a little scared that it'll happen again, I don't know if this is being genderfluid nor what and I'm hoping you kind folks might be able to help me understand this a bit better.

When I reached middle school, and things started changing, and having to change in the girls locker room, it crushed me that I was a girl. 

I don’t mind being a girl now (21), but some days I feel so much like a guy. My girlfriend (lesbian; almost together 1 year now) is very understanding and doesn’t mind that I feel like a guy; even when we engage is bedroom activities - we’re both still virgins. 99% of the time when we’re just fooling around, I feel like I have the guy parts. We have clothes on, but I still feel like I do. I can feel I guess you could say what a guy probably feels - hence feeling the parts. 

Sometimes during the day I feel like I have a beard. When she puts her hand on my chest, I feel like it’s completely flat.

I don’t know if I want to switch though. I also don’t have the money. She said she’d still be with me if I did.
