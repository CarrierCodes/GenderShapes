2019-09-04 00:26:59,czdd4p,2,8,"Ok, hi i'm new to Reddit! This is actually my first ever post, still trying to get things down. I joined mostly so I could join LGBT groups, but mainly this one. I'd like to be a part of this community and kinda find myself idk :))).

This is gonna be like my entire life story lol and I don't know exactly how to start this so bear with me.

So I'm 20 yrs old (AMAB) and completing my last year in college at ECU. I've always felt conflicted about my gender and sexuality mostly because I didn't have the words to really express to myself who I really am, but I have recently confronted the emotions I've been repressing all of my life. 

I'm pretty sure I'm genderfluid my dudes!!!

I've experienced dysphoria all of my life. Ever since I was little I would occasionally feel this intense urge that I was a girl. But this wasn't always. It would be about once a week or so, or sometimes very strongly for a month and then not at all. And I would put these feelings off too, never confront them because I didn't really know what these feelings meant. My elementary school was very homophobic-- boys and girls were dating as young as 6-7 years old and you would get picked on and beat up if you displayed any gay tendencies. This was around the time I started crossdressing secretly. I would tie my sweatshirt around my waist and pretend it was a skirt. I would then tie a towel or T-shirt on my head and pretend it was my long hair. I would pull up my shirt I was wearing on my body, tie it, and pretend it was a belly-top and I would put on my mom's high heels when no one was looking. I would sit differently, with my legs crossed, and walk with my hips swiveled, like a woman, and I would feel very validated.

Sometimes I would want for my mom to put makeup on me, and she did sometimes because she wanted to and not because I ever asked her to, because I never did. Every time she asked me to I would tell her no, ""that's gay"". And then after some time I would give in and pretend I didn't like it. Then I would look at myself in the mirror and be happy I was so beautiful. I would identify secretly to myself as a girl, not simply as a feminine boy. I was so happy too with how much I looked like a girl! I didn't always feel like a girl growing up, though. Post-puberty I developed gynecomastia (swollen chest tissue) which I still have and I became conflicted about it-- because on one end of the spectrum I really hated it for making me look less like a man, but I also liked having breasts that I could play with and even lick my nipples (sorry). The thing is I don't always want to be a woman! Only sometimes (40% of the time) do I feel like I need to be one, and other times (40%) I want to be a man and 20% of the time I just don't give it a thought. Idk its kinda complicated for me to explain and I don't have all the language I would need in order to quite yet. Im still figuring a lot out.

So in high school, we did this thing where students would crossdress for spirit week (opposite day). At first I was reluctant to participate but my mom convinced me that everyone would be doing it so I decided why not. She gave me one of her multicolored dresses that I wore over a pink and navy blue striped polo and I put a necklace on. I loved how I looked in the mirror. In one of my classes the girls saw me and some other 'boys' who were crossdressing for the day and offered to do our makeup. I said yes, and it was the first time I ever wore eyeliner and mascara and foundation. Although some people did judge, more or less everyone was supportive. I looked at myself at the end of the day in the bathroom mirror and thought ""wow I'd be so pretty as a girl"". This trend of crossdressing and looking in the mirror would continue all the way until now. It was only recently that I really gave it any thought.

I came out as bisexual to my mom and it didn't end well for me. The same process it took for me to realize I was bisexual I had for my realization I was genderfluid. At first I thought that me being attracted to men made me gay. The first time I came out to anyone as LGBT it was to my mom as gay, because I believed that you couldn't like multiple genders. But then I realized that sexuality is fluid and that I could be attracted to all genders! In regards to discovering my gender, I would be in the shower thinking about how much I want a vagina right now, and breasts and hips and a feminine face, and this would not be all of the time, so I made nothing out of it. Until one day I introspected and said to myself, ""hey you might be what you feared you were"". So I gave it some thought and gave legitimacy to that thought and soon it turned into a deep conviction.

It's difficult to explain, but at first, I chocked up me being attracted to men as me fulfilling that inner desire to be a woman. I associated the two when there is no correlation. This is why it took me a long time to realize that in addition to being bisexual I am also genderfluid. I felt as if being genderfluid was antithetical to being bisexual without taking into account that gender attraction is actually separate from gender expression.  

I have weird feelings about my breasts, as I mentioned before, so right now I am working on developing a very muscular build. It's been about a year and a half of me actually seriously exercising and I'm actually making semi-decent progress. But I also kinda would like to transition some time in the future. I was thinking about getting chest surgery to remove my breasts to look more like a man but I also would like to transition into a woman, take estrogen, some time in the future, even though I know it wont solve everything about my dysphoria, especially the side of me that wants to look more like a man. I would still like to transition at least once though so I can know what it feels like and see if I can become any happier from it. I know that if I remove my breasts, they wont be as big when I transition. I feel like im in a catch 22. And I don't wish to look ambiguous because it will magnify my dysphoria even more (no offense to nonconforming gender presentation). It just isn't for me. I wouldn't feel free that way.

Any tips or advice? Im so nervous, Ive never done anything like this before, I feel like Im finding out all this stuff and I dont know how to react or properly be my gender. I just wanna do what I can to alleviate my dysphoria a little and maybe become happier.

This is a qualitative study that will examine the attitudes and experiences of non-binary, gender nonconforming, and genderqueer parents. The research will answer the question: how do GNC individuals transition into parenthood, and how to they share the roles and responsibilities of parenting?

Sociologists have extensively studied parenting and gender inequality in home. Moreover, literature has positioned the differentiation of motherhood and fatherhood as a driver of the gender binary. However, this research has focused primarily on cisgender and heterosexual parents or gay/lesbian parents. Non-binary, gender nonconforming, and genderqueer individuals remain a population of parents that social science research has ignored. This work will fill this gap. By studying the attitudes and experiences of individuals who do not identify as strictly male or female, this work will contribute to a greater sociological understanding of gender, parenting, and the binary.",genderfluid,Harvard GNC Parent Study,1567806641.0,"{'created_utc': 1567781441, 'id': 'd0ho6b', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 2, 'selftext': '&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Study Information:](https://i.redd.it/zell7woglzk31.jpg)\n\nThis is a qualitative study that will examine the attitudes and experiences of non-binary, gender nonconforming, and genderqueer parents.

I’ve been (very) lightly exploring my gender expression for a couple years now, but I haven’t been able to sort my feelings out.

There are times I feel masculine and there are times I feel feminine, and depending on my mood I want to go all in one way or the other. I don’t feel NON-binary, nor do I want to look androgynous, rather, I want to present very traditionally masculine or feminine depending on my mood. I want to be on both ends of the binary, if you will.

2019-09-11 05:19:21,d2l59o,6,5,"Alright, finally worked up the courage to post here. For the longest time I suppressed all my thoughts about my gender, instead only focusing on my sexuality which in its self was confusingly enough. But thanks to my wonderful partner showing me how my sexual preferences really dont matter to anyone but me, he helped me start focusing on even thinking about my gender. 

I'm AMAB (I think that's the correct term for biological male). I've always been generally extremely masculine in general public scenes, general a bit of an angry psycho through my teens, lots of martial arts, sports, breaking/blowing stuff up, always focused on working out trying to be bigger/stronger. I've always been slim and toned, and at 6'10"", very hairy with a full beard and big hands I've always had an imposing figure. I'm often somewhat emotionless, despite being an empath. I'm often described by my friends as a sociopath with an empath on switch. Not great at feeling my own emotions, but can feel others.

However I'm almost 23 now and over the last 6 months my partner has helped me see that a lot of more feminine things make me quite happy. Being able to be the hyper emotional and nurturing one, letting myself gain some fat to have some curves. We're only just started exploring any femininity in bed because that's where I'm very comfortable,  but I'm looking for something else.

I'm starting to crave a way to feel more feminine.  Have that extra level of self emotional feeling, that feeling of physical self awareness and vulnerability. Physically I know I wish I had breasts, sometimes other stuff, but that's difficult to work with and not really what I'm looking for at this moment.

One thing i do know is i dont like makeup, at least not things like lipstick or eyeshadow. It think heavily colored makeup is unnatural looking and i dont like it on anyone, especially not myself, and trust me, my man has already tried.

I'm also rather attached to my beard, at least for the next 8 months or so as I live in a very very cold place and the beard is a godsend on days with freezing rain or sub -10 nights. Maybe next summer I can experiment with no beard.

 But are there any other small things i could start with for exploring a feminine side?

I am genderfluid and pursuing my master’s degree in clinical mental health counseling (whoop whoop, represent!), and I just want to say, please be picky about your counselors/therapists you seek. Sometimes counselors get elevated to this level that what they say is right, they are fully informed and educated, etc. Being with my classmates, being out in every class for over a year now, and still being met with cissexism, I know not every counselor will be healthy for you. 

To bitch for a sec: It is so discouraging being misgendered by all of these people with cultural diversity training and an expressed desire to understand and accept others. It’s beyond my classmates, it’s my supervisors and professors, too. The ones that actually catch their language are a godsend, but most ignore my “please default to they pronouns for me until I tell you/you see my pronoun pin.” 

One day, I will be there for you. Together we can be a beautiful genderflood. Until then, please be cautious. Gender minority issues, as much as we are talking about it in my program (one of the top in the nation- which sucks in a way), is still so ingrained in a lot of my cisgender peers in ways that I know would be actively harmful if any of you were exposed to them. That’s really fucking scary, I know. So please be picky. 

If you are seeking therapy, please call the therapist first and drop some trans-language at them. If they don’t know even basic words for the transgender community, like passing, AFAB/AMAB (or any of its equivalents), then skip over them. It is not your job to educate them and get them caught up to speed. 

I had to educate my counselor about genderfluidity, but that was it. He understood passing, my difficulties in creating space for me in more masculine places, and how my experience of being AFAB compounds some of my rape fears especially when in guymode. When I sobbed to him how I’m so fucked when I graduate since I’m surrounded by people with cultural diversity training who continue to invalidate me, he went on this really sweet talk of how there will be a place for me and some people will seek me out *because* I’m genderfluid rather than *despite*. Like I totally forgot my identity isn’t a burden because that’s all it’s been treated as for a year. It was so sweet of him, and he meant every word.

My name is Louis Lindley and I am queer transmasculine researcher with Towson University.

We are conducting a research study examining transgender and non-binary individuals’ engagement with sexual activities. We want to make sure that the literature on transgender sexual engagement is rooted in the actual lived experiences of transgender individuals and to do this we need your help. The survey will take between 20-30 minutes and will ask about your engagement with various sexual activities. 

If you are interested, please visit [**https://tinyurl.com/yxj856n8**](https://tinyurl.com/yxj856n8)

Participation is completely voluntary, and your answers will remain anonymous. 

If you have any questions or comments please email me at [llindl1@students.towson.edu](mailto:llindl1@students.towson.edu) or my advisor, Dr. M. Paz Galupo, at [pgalupo@towson.edu](mailto:pgalupo@towson.edu) 

**Transgender Research Informed Consent (TRICON) Disclosure Policy:**

**Objective:** The objective is to gain a better understanding of how gender expectations, gender dysphoria, and body satisfaction may or may not interact to impact levels of sexual satisfaction. The results of this study will help to inform clinicians who work with transgender clients to improve their sexual satisfaction.

**Primary Investigator:** The co-PI’s are Louis Lindley (graduate student at Towson University) and Annalisa Anzani (Doctoral Student at University of Milano – Bicocca) who are being supervised by Dr. M. Paz Galupo (professor at Towson University)

**Trans Involvement:** Louis Lindley is a queer transman. Due to the inclusion of questions about sexual activities; we sought the feedback and suggestions of other transgender researchers while creating the survey to ensure the survey was affirming and would not be unnecessarily triggering. 

**Sponsoring Institution/Funding:** This project is not funded nor are there any sponsoring institutions or organizations.

**Institutional Review Board:** The IRB at Towson University approved this study.

**Target population:** Any individual over the age of 18 who identifies as non-binary, transgender, or with a transgender history is asked to participate in this study. As always, we hope to have a diverse sample in terms of race and SES and will do targeted sampling if necessary, to insure we are not only reporting on the experiences of white, middle to upper class trans or non-binary individuals. While we include participants from all over the world, the survey is only available in English. 

**Compensation:** There is no cost to participant in the study nor are there any travel requirements. There is no compensation for participating in the study. 

**Accessing Results:** The result of this study will be published in a peer reviewed journal. While we cannot guarantee that the article will be open access, we will post an accessible link to Louis Lindley’s research gate once it is accepted and published.",genderfluid,participants needed for trans affirming research!,1568426943.0,"{'created_utc': 1568401743, 'id': 'd3u04z', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 1, 'selftext': '  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](n07tj53xtem31)\n\nMy name is Louis Lindley and I am queer transmasculine researcher with Towson University.\n\nWe are conducting a research study examining transgender and non-binary individuals’ engagement with sexual activities.

2019-09-13 19:59:42,d3upo2,10,6,"Sorry if this offends anyone or I just look stupid, I'm new to all of this. So let's start by saying I'm 16 bi AMAB. Now everything was just peachy until I mentioned on a post that everytime I went on r/egg_irl it would freak me out. Then someone mentioned I might be an egg and now from a span of a few hours to a few days I freak out if I am trans or not. Now I looked up the official definition and symptoms of gender disphora and didn't show any of the signs (I don't really hate/disgusted by my genitals, ECT) so I don't really know if I could be trans, but I have noticed a couple things that freak me out. 
   
   First, I have always had an interest in people transforming from one gender to the other (I once looked up steroid side effects just to see guys with breast, once tried to see if my genitalia would shrink, watched a ""watch this and turn into a girl"" YouTube video), now this could also be because I have a TG fetish (I know it's terrible, I can't control it). I also thought sometimes that I was born female due to my hair and nails growing faster than anyone else's and my general body shape.

   Second, I have wondered what breast and a vagina would feel like/ feel like during sex. Don't know what this means really, though I have noticed that I don't like stuff touching my breast or people looking at them, whether that means something or if I just have sensitive nipples and shyness.

   Third, I have sometimes pictured myself as a girl, most of the time it just happens during day dreams of sex and what not. It stays somewhat consistent.

   Fourth, I sometimes hate my voice. I have a naturally higher voice for a male and sometimes I hate it for being too low, and sometimes for being too high. This usually starts the thought loops of me worrying about being trans for the rest of the day.

Now thing against me being trans is that 

A. I don't mind being male, my name, people seeing me as male, using the male bathroom, ECT

B. I don't particularly want to be female forever and onwards. If I had to pick, I would just want to be able to shift back and forward at will(I know this sounds really obvious, just hold on)

C. I don't really care for more femme stuff (ie makeup, dresses, long hair, ECT). If I had to be female, I would want to be punk masc (shortish hair like [this](https://photos.app.goo.gl/56ha6uuiWeoC8qro8), tank tops, t-shirts, boots, jeans, ECT) So I don't know if that disqualifys me or not.

In August, I went to my first pride festival (it was okay) after freaking out for a while for being there, I talk to this lovely enby person at one of the booths from which I was able to talk to about a lot of stuff I was keeping in, one of which being gender. She mentioned that I could be genderfluid, which after looking it up some more seems interesting and close to me but I'm not sure I am one. I don't know what other genderfluid people deal with (like I noticed many use they/them pronouns, I don't care if I get called he/him. Though I have accepted that it's a possibility that I am as of recently. The lovely enby at the festival mentioned the ""Starbucks test"" which I am nowhere near brave enough to do, but it did get me thinking about if I was female what would my name be, from which I believe Elizabeth or Beth for short is pretty good.

2019-09-14 01:26:56,d3ysnt,2,1,"Hello fluid friends,

I'm starting T soon (hopefully), and I am full of hopes and worries and hours of overthinking, so I've decided to share a little here just to get it all out. And maybe even to help other people feel a little less alone in this process if anyone out there is going through something similar. 

I'm AFAB and I identify genderqueer/genderfluid (pronouns: they/them). I tend to shift around between feeling femme male, gay male, butch female, hyperfemme, transmasculine, genderless, and blob (I made that one up), but my body is so feminine that I don't feel like I can express my particular brand of boyishness and/or genderlessness without being misinterpreted as simply female. Binders have helped a lot, but I also really really want broader shoulders and a sharper jawline and less of a waist and darker leg hair, so I've been working on getting T. It's been stressful. I had my first appointment with a doctor this week, and I was so worried the whole time that I was going to say the wrong thing and be disqualified. But it went ok! And I have an appointment next week to go over my hormone level tests and hopefully proceed with the stabby stabby part. 

I'm super excited to think that my body is going to start growing into something more reflective of who I am and how I feel. I am also scared, honestly. The whole stabbing myself with a needle thing seems horrible. I'm also a worried about facial hair too since on my hyperfemme days I think that I wouldn't really want it. I guess that's what razors are for though, and honestly I'm pretty excited for just the ritual of shaving my face--such a masculine practice in my book. I'm most scared of the acne. My skin isn't amazing now, and the idea of adding more does freak me out. Not pumped for it.

I've also been reading into these fears in a very self-doubtful way, which has taken a while to get over. I've finally realized that I'm allowed to be a bit scared (after all medical stuff is inherently terrifying) and even a little sad to say goodbye to my old body and old self. After all, my old self did carry me through much of my life and I am very grateful for that. 

This whole process has been full of paradoxes, really. Like I worry that people I find attractive won't find me attractive after I transition, but at the same time I definitely don't feel attractive having to hide my body to be myself. I love showing off my body, and I can't wait to show off a body that is correct for my identity. I worry about becoming angrier because I don't want to be an angry person, but also I often find myself wishing I could be more aggressive when I need to be (e.g. not taking any sh*t about my pronouns). I worry that binary-minded people might start mistaking me for a man, which would not be cool, but also I know that being mistaken for a woman continues to be a very uncool thing in my life. 

There is so much to this--so much muchness. It's overwhelming in the same way that walking alone in a forest at night is overwhelming. It's overwhelming in the same way that jumping into icy water in overwhelming. It is so much. 

But I guess that all these strong and shifting emotions are very on brand for my genderfluid experience and identity. When my entire identity is constantly metamorphosing and brimming to be free, why shouldn't my emotions do the same? 

Anyway, I'd love to hear if anyone else has similar feelings about their transition process or other non-similar feelings about it. One of my favorite things about this community is each of our undying commitments to being true to ourselves and embracing this beautiful crazy mind-blowing experience in our own ways.

I am Gender Fluid (AFAB) and I have been for an extremely long time but didn't exactly figure it out until the last few years. At one point I thought I was a trans male and took testosterone for a couple of years until, even when I suspected I was Gender Fluid. I stopped because I just didn't enjoy comments my family and associates were saying. I felt happy when I looked masculine. 

That is what my main issue is. I wish I was born male, I want a flat chest, I want to have a different set of downstairs equipment, and I want smaller hips. I wish I was taller and my voice was deeper. 

I still feel like a girl sometimes I think and I'm pretty sure I'm Gender Fluid but I feel like if I suddenly switched sexes I'd probably cry from happiness. 

Is this normal? That I would have a cis male body and still be gender fluid? Is something wrong with me? I can't tell anymore. I don't even know if I can my girlfriend (she is a trans woman btw) the extent of this. I have a hard time having sex with her now despite really really wanting to because I hate being the one on the receiving end and I want her to be the one receiving end and I don't have the necessary equipment to do it.

Hi, I'm a 27yo AFAB person, been identifying as genderfluid for the past 6 years or so. In these years, I've sometimes wondered whether I was maybe a man instead of a genderfluid person, but then usually concluded that that was probably not the case, for whatever reason. I usually dress rather femme, disphoria goes up and down but lately the need to not have a chest has been high so I finally bit the bullet and ordered a binder. It arrived yesterday, and it fits great. Yay!

Now, I'm bi/pan and polyamorous, so been dating a few people and they're all super supportive. There's a cis guy I've been seeing for about 6 months, and he's not great in expressing his thoughts and feelings so he didn't say much about it, I think he's probably adjusting to things as he's only dated cis women before. We had a nice evening and then got frisky, and though I usually never have an issue with this, suddenly penetration felt weird. Even with fingers. The physical sensation was nice, but somehow it felt... off. Even though before yesterday, I've absolutely loved it most of the time.

I'm pretty darn confused about this. I'm unsure about what this 'means'. I seem to love wearing my binder, masc clothing seems way more appealing, did I just kickstart my own transition?",genderfluid,Genderfluid confusion during sex,1568907849.0,"{'created_utc': 1568882649, 'id': 'd6b7lq', 'num_comments': 4, 'score': 4, 'selftext': "" Crossposted on r/ftm and r/genderqueer\n\nHi, I'm a 27yo AFAB person, been identifying as genderfluid for the past 6 years or so.

2019-09-19 09:54:34,d6bskt,4,2,"Hey! I could really use some support right now. Not sure if this is the right subreddit, but I didn't know a better place to post, since I have never explored non-binary communities and I'm not sure if this kind of a thing would be welcome in trans male spaces. I know it's kind a longish post, but if you'd take the time to read it, I'd be very grateful.

So, I used to think I was a binary trans man. Always had a masculine way of dressing, intense dysphoria about any of my feminine features, ecstatic when someone referred to me with male pronouns, the whole works. One of those boring ""knew since I was 6 years old"" types. (Though I did have a girly phase in my teens, and later took an interest in drag.) I've always supported non-binary identities, but it used to make me wildly uncomfortable when people referred to me personally with terms like ""transmasculine"" instead of just ""a man.""

I came out about a year ago so I could start the transition process (which is kind of long and tedious in my country) and didn't look back. My feelings were only those of happiness and relief. I finally felt like my life was mine, that I really existed.

Then, yesterday, something weird and wholly unexpected happened. As I was idly scrolling through a totally unrelated gaming subreddit, I saw a silly comic about a girl that I related to. No biggie, people can relate to other genders, happens all the time. Except that upon closer inspection, I noticed that my dysphoria was gone. More than that, I felt like a woman. That is to say, the thought of others seeing me as a woman no longer made me hurt, sad or angry.

It all came out of NOWHERE. I just stared at the screen frozen for like 5 minutes and then said ""Well, shit,"" to myself, because what else was I supposed to do? I've gone through a year of intense interrogation about my identity without ever doubting myself, and am almost at the point where I can finally get on testosterone. I've been daydreaming about transitioning for forever. And now, suddenly, I'm sitting here, feeling like one of the girls.

I mean, this might be great news, if I knew it would last. No more dysphoria, no painful misgendering, no need to come out to people etc. Transitioning is NOT easy. But if this all happened so suddenly, how was I to know things wouldn't go back to the way they were just as quickly?

I was obviously distraught, and my girlfriend soon noticed something was up. I was reluctant to tell her at first, but these feelings kept getting more intense. By the end of the night, I was actually SCARED of testosterone making me seem so masculine that I'd never be able to pass as a woman again — a thing I used to want more than anything. The identity crisis escalated into a full meltdown. My girlfriend did her best to comfort me, but I could tell she was caught off-guard as well.

Not being able to do anything else, I bawled for the rest of the night, and then reluctantly came into the conclusion that I might be bigender or genderfluid. My girlfriend said she loves me no matter my gender, and I obviously love her, so all is well on that front, even if she is still confused, and understandably worried.

I eventually managed to get some sleep, and woke up feeling almost back to normal. 

The biggest problem about all this is that my country doesn't acknowledge non-binary identities. You can get a diagnosis, but as I understand it, only binary trans people are allowed to transition at all. One of the reasons I've passed through the process in only a year is because I used to be such a ""textbook case."" If 99% of me wants testosterone, that might still not be enough if 1% doesn't.

All our local trans resources recommend seeking a binary trans diagnosis if you want access to treatment, even if that isn't what best describes you, so I think that's what I'll do. I don't want to make it harder for future me to get testosterone because of how I felt on one single evening.

But, seriously, what am I supposed to do now? Am I even allowed to call myself a ""trans man"" anymore?

2019-09-26 01:20:24,d9cn59,0,2,"i've lived in a state of semi-outness for about a year now. my spouse, a handful of close friends, and a handful more of extended friends have heard it from my own mouth that i identify as genderfluid and am not participating in the binary.

i haven't found the words or the moment to do any sort of formal ""announcement"" of coming out. i made a call to go more with a ""soft-launch"" wherein i just start walking the walk. part of it is because i left most of social media due to anxiety and not sure what platform such an announcement would even go on. and part of it, i regret, is that i'm a little afraid of what it would look like to have to publicly defend/explain/justify/rationalize myself for it. a year later though, i'm starting to feel like i owe it to myself and to the people in my life to offer a clearer explanation of what's going on with me.

it seems like genderfluid is a particularly complicated identity to have to explain. it feels SO much to do with my own intuition! when do i ""feel like a girl"" or ""feel like a boy""? i just answer that question day by day by using highly circumstantial and intuitive and frankly subjective self-analyses. by really considering how i feel and logging it, looking for patterns, pushed the extremes a little, i've definitely been able to ride my gender swings more consciously by adapting my outward presentation to match the intuitive inner feelings that fluctuate along the masc/fem spectrum, and importantly, find a more androgynous baseline of presentation that does wonders in mitigating dysphoria.

but i get hung up here: if the gender binary is all a construct that ought to be dismantled in favor of a continuum with infinite hues, it sure feels like even by having a ""girl day"" or a ""boy day"" and considering three sets of rolling pronouns depending on my intuition feels really subservient to the gender binary in which i profess to eschew participation. because i sort of *am* still participating in a certain kind of binary based on the notion that it's culturally understood that getting a cute manicure (etc) is feminine and getting your muscles jacked at the gym (etc) is masculine. there are also even less tangible things like capacities of empathy or creativity, pushes for power or competitiveness, that have gendered histories. like, the social construct of gender *itself* feels so entrenched in the binary!

so i guess, my concern is that i'm not sure i can offer a completely contradiction free explanation of my gender, or an explanation that doesn't account heavily on my own circumstantial intuition. and i've felt like if i can't offer that, i shouldn't come out because *what if i'm wrong and my intuition is leading me astray or i'm misreading all the cues and ""true"" identity is something else and i just don't realize it right now* – thoughts like this that sow doubt in my own sense of judgement.

i know realistically i probably won't be interrogated by some gender prosecutor, but at the same time i do feel like i want to fully understand the ""system"" of how this all works and it bothers me that i don't. i just feel and react, same way i do art.

2019-09-26 17:23:42,d9mscp,0,2,"Hello, r/genderfluid!

For my undergraduate senior exhibition project, I am compiling a series of comic book issues focused on LGBTQA themes. I am creating a comic book issue about stories for each major letter of the LGBTQA acronym and want to include a more diverse selection of stories from primary sources rather than hunting around for accounts written by journalists and authors. I have chosen to survey Reddit for research because I have done it multiple times in the past and feel the platform is great for reaching a wide and diverse audience.

**Who am I?**

I am a queer person who is interested in portraying queer stories that often get overlooked in media. I am also a comic book fanatic and an illustration nut who wants to stretch my wings and use comics as a medium to portray these stories.

**Why survey?**

While I am a Queer person, I am not a gay man, I am not a queer person of color, I am not Asexual, and it would be unfair/ego-driven/gross to assume I can accurately portray these perspectives. The goal is to show off personal queer experiences and what is the point if I disingenuously write a perspective I do not understand?

The stories can be as short as you want, even just 2-3 sentences, and yours may be adapted into a short 2-3 page comic in one of my comic books.

**I will not be profiting off of this work but you might help me get a job! :\^)**

THE SURVEY WILL CLOSE ON OCTOBER 8TH AT 11:00 PM CDT

Here is the link to the survey
