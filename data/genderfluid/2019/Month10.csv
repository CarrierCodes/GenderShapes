Its been a while since I started considering the idea that I'm genderfluid and I'm feeling very confused right now. 

I spent a week flowing between nb and boy and I realized it wasn't the first time that it happened in my life. I felt truely disphoric about my hips and breasts and it was kinda uncomfortable. I also feel like I never identifyed entirely as a girl 100% of time, but most times I'm a girl, and a very feminine one. I see gender fluid people skiping from girl to boy to none to both in a week, and I feel weird identifying like this just because I dont feel female a few times in a year.

I'm pretty confused and scared. A part of me says its just a phase because I'm reading a lot about it on Twitter and wanted attention. I'm surrounded by people that love me and want to help me, but are also much confused about all of this. I know my girlfriend (a very butch lesbian) sees me as a girl and, at start, she thought gender fuid was a personality disorder, but its not because she doesn't love me and don't want to help.

I'm very scared of figuring out I'm like this and having to explain to everyone. I'm going to college next year and I can't even imagine wgat people will say about it. Despite being pansexual, I had never been in the closet before and I definitely don't know what to do. I don't even feel valid to talk about being gender fluid because I never suffered any kind of transphobia because of that.

Are you a parent or prospective parent? Do you identify as non-binary, gender-nonconforming, genderqueer, and/or gender fluid? If so, you might be able to participate in a paid Harvard study examining the experiences of GNC parents. Confidentiality is guaranteed, and $20/hr compensation is provided for a casual interview.

This is a qualitative study that will examine the attitudes and experiences of non-binary, gender nonconforming, and genderqueer parents. The research will answer the question: how do GNC individuals navigate their parent identity, and how to they share the roles and responsibilities of parenting?

Sociologists have extensively studied parenting and gender inequality in home. Moreover, literature has positioned the differentiation of motherhood and fatherhood as a driver of the gender binary. However, this research has focused primarily on cisgender and heterosexual parents or cis gay/lesbian parents. Non-binary, gender nonconforming, and genderqueer individuals remain a population of parents that social science research has ignored. This work will fill this gap. By studying the attitudes and experiences of individuals who do not identify as strictly male or female, this work will contribute to a greater sociological understanding of gender, parenting, and the binary.

2019-10-11 17:03:03,dgi1v4,5,2,"If this isn't allowed, please feel free to remove this but I really need to get this out of my system before I hurt myself.  So last night, my brother had a friend over for dinner.  It was kind of unexpected, but fortunately I made a big enough dish for all of us.  I met the guy once or twice I think but I don't know many of my brother's friends very well.  For the most part, the dinner was pretty nice.  It was interesting hearing him talking about his job and the career he wants in the future.  We had fun laughing at stupid jokes and such, it was nice.  But then he started joking about something about how doctors can't assign gender to babies and only the baby themselves can when they can't even talk and my brother started joining in on it.  

Now, to be clear, I am not out to my brother or my mom (the only people who know irl is my oldest sister and her husband), so my brother would have no way of knowing that was kind of hurtful to me.  I have dropped some subtle hints to him and my irl friends, but sadly I'm too good at subtlety.  I know my brother would never intentionally try to hurt me because he knows I can be sensitive, but even then, he knows there are transgender people I follow online, and he knows I very much support it.  As for his friend, again, he doesn't really know me so I seriously doubt he would intentionally be trying to hurt me as well.  He seemed like a really fun and chill guy but even in a joking sense that just came off as incredibly insensitive to me.  And worse, it all but reinforced the thought in my head that I can never tell my brother about me.  He's always been iffy about trans people and he's still not on board with gay or bi people.  He follows an older mindset about how life is supposed to be instead of opening himself up to the idea of alternatives.  It just kills me inside that I feel I can never tell my brother, my closest sibling that I grew up with, one of the most important things about myself to him because he'll either never understand or won't accept it and, even more fearful, he'll reject me.  I'm already afraid we've drifted apart enough as is despite the fact we live in the same house but if I lose him completely because of something I can't control and he's too stubborn to understand or accept it, I couldn't live with that.  The rest of my family all have their own lives, my brother and my mom are basically the only family I really have.  If I were to lose either of them over this, I wouldn't be able to bear it.  I do think my brother knew I was upset over the joke because I stopped laughing at that point, and fortunately the conversation went back to jokey jokes and it ended up being a nice dinner but that part still left me feeling upset.

tl;dr My brother who doesn't know about me joined in on a joke that unknowingly hurt me.

I know I live in a fairly safe country but I sometimes just want to disappear. 

I was in my horrible english class ( I usually love english class but somehow this teacher has managed to make me hate it) and i was writing down name ideas since I‚Äôve been thinking about changing to a more gender neutral name (I change between female and male and go by both he/his/him and her/she/hers pronouns like at the same time) Anyways I had to keep flipping over my page whenever the teacher walked over to look like I was doing work. I was scared that she‚Äôd do that thing where they snatch your note or whatever and read it out to the whole class since she already threatened on a group of girls earlier that class. 

Almost a year ago now my dad went to a conference about being lgbtq+ in the work place and fighting against discrimination in the well work place. They gave them these tags where they would write out their full name and what pronoun(s) they go as. My dad said it was kind of stupid and the whole meeting/presentation was a waste of time and kind of pointless. My parents aren't religious and are fairly accepting heck my dad‚Äôs job is literally to help more minorities get hired in the government but both of them just make inward comments around the house when its just us three (my dad, mom and I) that make me think that even though they ‚Äòoutwardly accept it that it‚Äôll be different when it‚Äôs their kid‚Äô. 

The gsa alliance at my highschool is pushed into one little corner just last week they got a wall where they painted a nice scenic background, painted and hung up a bunch of different pride flags and taped a whole door in rainbow (it was a janitors closret inbetween the two entrances to the bathrooms).  Lots of kids hated on it and spewed other bullshit. We don‚Äôt have any gender neutral bathrooms in my school just male and female bathrooms with no doors on them which even I think are awful. People can hear you taking a shit from a mile away and the whole student body is protesting against it. I want to feel accepted not like I have no privacy.

My 5yo told me this morning that sometimes they feel like a girl, and sometimes they feel like a boy. Today they were feeling like a boy and would like to be called by a new/different name.   
I support this 100%. We had more conversation about it tonight, and they want to wear different clothes depending on how they are feeling that day as well as the different names, and when I asked they said they feel it (boy or girl) in their head.  
And today their teacher called them by the ""boy"" name.  


I am using ""they/them"" bc I have no idea what i'm doing and don't want to mess up... that's generally my whole approach to this.  I have told them I want to help and support them however I can and I am happy to talk about whatever they want. I also asked if I could tell their Dad and they said no, so I won't (and I have mixed feelings about this but don't want to breach their trust).  


Ok anyway.. can anyone point me to some reading I can do?  I had a quick search through the sub but didn't find anything for quite such a young child. I just want to do the right thing to support my kid.

Okay, so I've be**e**n on HRT for over a year 
(amab, known I was not male for ~1.5 yrs). I was always pretty dang sure I'm binary female - I hate being seen as a *man*, and being treated as such.
However over the past few months I've had these times where I feel like a boy. Not a *man*, but a soft little fem*boy*. And during those rare days I like being called a boy and they/them or he/him over being called a girl. I only just started really experimenting and telling my partners, but it seems a rare thing.
My presentation doesn't change too much yet, I mostly just wear my shorts and baggy sweatshirts that I'd wear on a lazy day as a girl, but I want that pastel e-boy look y'know? My attitude and voice change a little bit too, though not an extreme amount, and I'd prefer going by a different name (JoJo or Jesse) I think? Though I already legally changed my name and I am happy with it (Josie).
My genderfluid boyfriend is really what kicked off more curiosity, and they've been super supportive. My main bae (MTF) has been supportive, but she's struggled to understand a little because we transitioned at the same time. My other partners seem supportive too, but it's not been long and I'm not public about it really until I figure this all out.

I had a visit with my psychiatrist yesterday, and I thought it was a good opportunity to discuss how I was feeling. I‚Äôve been questioning my gender for months and recently I realized that I was genderfluid. Trying to keep it in was become to much and my anxiety levels were skyrocketing because of it, so I decided to confess to her how I felt about all this. I was terrified that she‚Äôd have a negative reaction- she would say that it was fake or something. 

and guess what- that didn‚Äôt happen at all!!!! she was super accepting of the whole thing and knows genderfluid people herself!! and god did i feel so much better after that. at the end of my appointment, she helped me come out to my mom, which also went surprisingly well!! she didn‚Äôt know what it meant, but i explained to her what it meant and how it relates to what i‚Äôm feeling and she was super nice about it?????? i gave her some resources where should could read up on it more and she really is trying her best to respect who i am. i honestly couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better scenario tbh. i still have a lot more people i could come out to but NOT REALLY COMFORTABLE WITH THAT RN.

2019-10-26 21:33:51,dnk4ri,0,2,"First, my experience with identify/gender/sexuality/whatever is deeply rooted in sex. One day I will be fantasizing sex as a woman and literally the next day sex as a man.

I am a biological male. I was deeply uncomfortable with my feminine side/fantasies when I was late teen and young adult. Now I don't care as much, but I can't help but feel that maybe my mind has created a some sort of coping mechanism as to enjoy sex as a straight male, because this male side kind of developed after years of discomfort with majority feminine fantasies.

However, my male side has seriously taken over during the last year to the point where I am starting to believe this was some kind of latent masculine identity. I legitimately enjoy it. Additionally, when I was initially going through puberty, I fantasized about women exclusively until I found pornography. I can't help but feel that left some kind of imprint on my young mind.

Both ""sides"" have grown stronger in their influence on my personality. When I have sexual fantasies as a female, I tend to have more classically feminine thoughts and mannerisms. The obverse is true for my male side.

It literally feels like there are two people living in me sometimes. It makes dating and even friendly relationships near impossible.

I don't think I will ever come out or marry. My gender identity/sexuality is just too flexible to consistently make a male or a female happy. I feel as if that if I did transition, and I am getting too old for that to seriously work at this point (28), that I would want to transition back on my male days. I literally flip every other day almost at this point.

I had massive body issues when I was a teenager as well, and I can't help but feel, combined with early exposure to pornography, that this may have contributed to some kind of escape via a feminine identity from my body, like becoming someone else to escape my issues. I felt, on some instinctual level, that I would never be able to get a girl based on my appearance (I was overweight and ugly througout my teens). I was deeply, deeply convinced of it.

New here but really looking for some guidance and or advice. 
Here's some backstory
Growing up I was always a little ""tomboy"" and kept many of those traits with me up until now (I'm 21 and in college). I have Borderline Personality Disorder which helps to make me feel like I have no idea who I am and all of that fun stuff but recently I've been trying to dress more feminine for a job I had. 
I started to really like it but now it's like every other day I hate how feminine clothes look on me.
So one day I texted my boyfriend and said ""I look pretty cute. I really can do both. Be a tomboy and be a girly girl. And both at the same time too. Wtf am I a chameleon"" 
He responded with ""It's incredible how closely that sounds to non-binary people I know who finally came to that realization""
So I've been doing more thinking and research on it and I'm honestly looking for real answers from real people. 
I dont want to transition or anything like that, I just want to know if what I'm feeling is similar to others experiences.

2019-10-28 02:11:02,do2o5v,1,3,"I know this happens to everyone at some point or another...but I just need someone to talk to, I guess.

I was AFAB and grew up very ""girly"". In fact, I still am. I love pink and glitter and bows and makeup and all the things that are traditionally feminine. (I don't feel those things have a gender but I digress)

I have always loved dressing up for Halloween and cosplay and things like that. Even as a kid, I remember pretending to be Power Rangers and I always wanted to be the red ranger (who is male). My childhood friend and I would watch movies and we would act out the parts with the scenes, and I always chose the male characters. When it comes to cosplay, I choose male characters more than female.

This all got me thinking maybe I was just into drag, but I noticed trends where I feel masculine or some form of non-binary for like a week or so at a time, maybe ten to fifteen times a year? That made me come to the conclusion about a year ago that I am genderfluid.

But now, I've been off my anxiety and depression medicine for like a week (I can't find it) and I'm having really strong feelings of self-doubt. What if I'm just transtrending or it's some sort of depression coping mechanism or something? I feel extremely feminine most days, but as I said, I get waves of dysphoria, but it's not enough that I want to transition or anything.

Sometimes I feel very in touch with my femininity and I want to partake in a lot of ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù hobbies, want to dress more femme, etc, but other times I don‚Äôt really feel connected to my gender at all. I typically dress more neutral (jeans/yoga pants and tshirts) and sometimes I get really weirded out when people refer to me as a woman or with she/her pronouns. I‚Äôve even started to consider binding sometimes to get a more androgynous silhouette, but sometimes I strive for an almost hyper-feminine ‚Äúfull of curves‚Äù look. I definitely don‚Äôt think I experience dysphoria, it‚Äôs more like a general disconnect to gender at all when I‚Äôm not in one of my super femme swings. 

I talked to my fianc√© about it last night and he thought that maybe I‚Äôm genderfluid, and that my fluidity goes between agender or some other NB state and 100% girl.
