I've liked them ( using they/them pronouns as I'm not sure which ones to use at the moment ) for a year and a bit and they just came out to me as gender fluid about an hour ago. I tried to support them as much as I could but I was still rather shaken. I wasn't confused or upset, I was over the moon. I was so happy that they trusted me enough to be the first person to tell this to and with ever secret they tell me, the more attracted to them I am.

I told them how proud I was and I hope they're not sat at home worrying right now. I really want to help them feel more comfortable and know how to fully support them but I have no experience with gender fluidity. A lot of my friends have changed their pronouns and names and I have tried my best to get them right, though it takes me a while to get used to as I have trouble controlling what I say. I am, however, much more worried than I've ever been right now, as I really don't want to accidentally use the wrong pronouns / name etc. 

If anyone could give any advice on how to help them, it would be greatly appreciated. I apologise if I have done something wrong in this post. I have never used Reddit before and I only just downloaded it to seek help. If I receive a request to delete this post, I apologise in advance for any mistakes and I will delete if if necessary.

I am, however, much more worried than I've ever been right now, as I really don't want to accidentally use the wrong pronouns / name etc. \n\nIf anyone could give any advice on how to help them, it would be greatly appreciated. I apologise if I have done something wrong in this post. I have never used Reddit before and I only just downloaded it to seek help. If I receive a request to delete this post, I apologise in advance for any mistakes and I will delete if if necessary. \n\nThank you.\n\n-Spoon"", 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': ""How do I help my genderfluid 'friend' feel more comfortable?"", 'created': 1575674407.0}"

2019-12-07 05:01:05,e7a4vd,0,1,"Hey ya'll,

So heres my current situation. I identify as genderfluid but much of my identity is male, I say when I have to label myself *""trans masculine genderfluid""* I go by he/him pronouns and even was on T for 2 years when I identified soley as FtM but have been off for 3 years and had top surgery a few years ago. So I've been around a bit when it comes to gender, I've had time for discovery and really defining who I am.

With all that being said, because I'm not on T anymore, I don't ""pass"" which I really don't care about- yes it sucks being called she/her/miss/mam and all of that but whatever because I love my female presentation (when the time calls for it and I am femme for that day) I have always gone by/identified with he/him and always will.

My girlfriend of a year just came out as a trans woman not too long ago and has been on estrogen for 5 months now. I've always felt conflicted in our relationship because even when she identified as a cis male I never really felt ""manly"" in the relationship. Back then we were ""boyfriends"" that label usually always fit, but because of the fluidity of my gender sometimes I would request to be called ""his"" girlfriend or other times we would just flip flop and use whatever came out if I was in an ambiguous stage and didn't care what I was called.

So my issue im struggling with is: ***I don't feel that my male identity is being validated enough and I don't know how we as a couple are supposed to work on it.*** She has always seen me as male ie; using my pronouns and referring to my anatomy as I prefer it to be called- so she's never done anything wrong, she's actually the most supportive human ever. But I just feel like because I am constantly invalidated in my daily life by the world that even the few people that respect me as male that I talk to on a daily basis, just doesn't stack up at the end of the day and I still feel like I'm not enough.

We've had this disussion before and there isn't an easy fix, its not like I want her calling me ""handsome"" and ""muscular"" and saying how ""manly"" I am and shit all the time, but I just dont always feel like the guy in the relationship and therefore feel lost and essentially invalidated. And like I said, with her now transitioning THAT dynamic is changing and makes stuff messier because now I have to affirm her and make her feel comfortable, accepted, validated and seen, and we are essentially a heterosexual couple \*(\****but we don't necessarily view it that way because of my fluidity-sometimes, VERY rarely it feels like a lesbian relationship and I have felt very dominant and masculine at times its just not consistent)***

I just dont know what to do. I know a lot of is it internal work I have to do to find peace within myself, ***but as far as our relationship do ya'll have any ideas on how she can affirm my male identity more?***

I've never known a genderfluid person and don't know what that means for how I should address her. I'm also just terrified I made the wrong choice and ruined her life by showing her this was an option even though it'll likely destroy her relationship with her family and cause her to be the center of a lot of hatred.

I’m a biological girl but consider myself genderfluid. Most of the time I identify as a girl and I’m sexually attracted to masculinity. I started going out with a friend since we both seemed interested on each other: he’s nice, smart, but younger than me by 5 years. I haven’t either dated anyone for a long time, neither have had sex during that period. Thing is, we had our first kiss last night and even though I felt aroused, I also felt a little...I don’t know, strange, like I wanted that kiss but after that I didn’t want to be with him anymore.

I stayed over last night at his, and today even though I can still hold a conversation with him, I just wanted to leave asap. The same thing has happened to me before with another guy I started dating months ago: had a couple dates, kissed, and felt like I didn’t like him anymore.

I don’t know if this has anything to do with sexuality or a mental/conduct problem outside of gender/sexuality issues. I just recently realized I’m genderfluid and I’m having panic attacks because it’s frustrating to feel like I think I really like someone, date them and kiss them and then I stop feeling like that.

 I'm Emery and was born female. I recently came out to my boyfriend as genderfluid, we have been together for like two weeks, and he's really lovely about it. He has asked what to refer to me as but swedish doesn't really have a gender neutral thing for girlfriend/boyfriend. Well, we have partner but it sounds so formal and weird.

I haven't come out to friends at school yet but I'm sure they will be ok with it. Most of my class are lgbt+ in some way.

I have always changed with the girls, but I have also never presented as nb or male on the days that we have PE. I haven't had the best of experienses in changing rooms at my old school. I was out as pan and all girls refused to change with me so I got one of the rooms all to myself. Kind of nice to be alone but come on? I won't bite you or anything...

Here's where the issue comes in: I've put a lot of work in the last several months trying to get people to see me more masculinely (despite being out as NB and using they/them pronouns), and I feel like I made progress with that (I go to a small college, so it's a very enclosed social space).

2019-12-17 21:12:17,ec22qk,18,1,"In the last couple of months, I embraced feelings I had repressed for decades and now express myself in a feminine manner when I feel like it.  I feel more at peace with myself, but I don't know if I'm genderfluid or something else.  I've talked to friends who are trans-women and while there are many similarities in how we feel and even in our life stories, the differences make me certain I'm not nor desire to be a trans-woman myself.

I don't know anyone who identifies as genderfluid, so I was hoping that by sharing some of my circumstances, thoughts, and feelings here I could get a different perspective.  What I am and what to call myself matters to me because while I feel more comfortable with myself, I don't like not knowing what to call myself or the feeling that maybe I'm the only person who feels the way I do.

* I was born a boy, I still think of myself as a 'man' and I don't feel like I'm in the wrong body.
* The vast majority of the time I'm comfortable presenting myself as a 'man'.
* I'm old enough that it's not unreasonable to call this a mid-life crisis.
* For as long as I can remember I liked 'girly' things.
* As a child I was made to feel guilt and shame for liking 'girly' things and those feelings of guilt and shame stuck with me throughout my life.
* I've never felt overly 'manly' and I had a lot of mental hang-ups for not being 'man enough'.
* I've always been much more comfortable in the company of women than men.
* I like the vast majority of the masculine features of my body, in particular, muscle mass which I'd like to slightly increase.
* I really don't like my body hair and shave all of it but arms &amp; legs.  I don't shave those parts since it would look odd when I'm presenting masculine.
* When I'm presenting feminine I like to dress in a very 'goth' style.  I've tried other looks but they don't feel right.
* I don't feel anything sexual about presenting feminine.
* I am incredibly attached to having a dick.
* I only present feminine when I'm around other people.  It feels like it would be a real waste of effort to get my make-up and wig looking right just to sit around and watch Netflix by myself.
* I use he/him pronouns but when I've been misgendered while presenting feminine it feels like a compliment.
* I don't like my nose and jawline when presenting feminine, I do when I'm presenting masculine.  Overall, I wish my face was a little more neutral so it would be easier to present either way.
* I don't feel like I'm 'acting' when I'm presenting feminine.  I know my mannerisms change, I've been told it's 'very effeminate man'.
* Sometimes I dress feminine and wear make-up but continue to act masculine, or at least as masculine I ever am.  When this happens I don't feel any pressure to be more feminine.
* Part of the appeal of dressing feminine, wearing make-up and a wig is I feel free to act feminine or masculine and I don't feel like there are any expectations on me.
* When I'm visually presenting as feminine I will sometimes rapidly switch mannerisms between feminine and masculine without thinking about it.  It seems like who I'm talking to, what we're talking about, what's going on around me etc... can all cause a switch.
* While I question my gender and I still have moments of doubt where I wonder if I'm losing my mind, I never feel any doubt about being exclusively sexually attracted to women.
* I don't feel like I need to be able to pass as a woman, but I like being able to cause people to at least think about it for a second.

I don't feel like I'm enough.  I spend most of my time as a man and I'm mostly okay with that.  I feel like I can't prove to myself or anyone else that I'm not just a man who likes to dress up like a goth girl on occasion.

2019-12-18 09:07:54,eca8a6,6,1,"Hi. I just got told today by my boyfriend of 6 years that's he's gender fluid, he thinks. He's still trying to figure it out himself. He's been keeping it secret and apologized for this ""coming out of nowhere"" for me. (He told me to keep using he. I asked.)

He has a lot of anxiety about change so I know how hard it must have been to tell me. It would have been hard to bring up without the panic attacks change brings. And I'm sure he's scared I'll view him differently or treat him differently. He asked me to just act like nothing is different.

Nothing is different. He's still the person I fell in love with and this doesn't change who he is. This is just a new part of him for me to get to know and add to the ever growing list of things that make him who he is.  As long as he still loves me and wants to be with me, I am happy. I told him that. I'm not sure how much it will help quell the fear, though. Anxiety isn't so easily beaten.

With him asking me to act like nothing has changed, I'm worried about causing him more anxiety by asking questions. But I have SO MANY questions. As a cis woman I don't have a frame of reference for understanding gender fluidity. I want to understand what he's going through.

I know it's different for everyone, but I hope I can get some perspective on it with your help. And any advice on how to be supportive without it seeming like I'm treating him different would be wonderful.

2019-12-19 11:10:12,ecrsqf,1,1,"Warning profanity and some triggering situations and just REALLY long and ranty TLDR at the end for ya'lls sakes.

I have no idea what I am at this point.  I just know being female is not 100% my thing by any means.  I had a hunch something was up since I was a child.  I loved playing with the boys more than girls, not to say I didn't socialize with women, because I did, just I enjoyed the fun boys had than girls.  I just understood them better.  They didn't care about gossip and chattering but going out and causing havoc.  To the point where I even said ""I feel like I should've been a boy but something went wrong halfway through"", I was maybe 8 at the time of saying this.  I always played with male toys.  I loved dinosaurs for as long as I can remember which later evolved into my love of dragons after discovering the Legend of Spyro series.  I even recall picking up a snake at one point and scaring one of my friends with it.  I loved getting my close in the boy's section because I believed they had better shirts for the most part and fit better.  I remember my mom decided to get boxers because I had issues with my thighs chafing and women's boxers weren't in our store, at least at the time, so we got men's.  

One of my female friends found out, she was an awful girl and I have no idea why I was friends with her, she is still a cunt in my book, but she saw the underwear when bending over or something and yelled I was wearing boys underwear and grabbed the back of my underwear and gave me a wedgy.  I felt... violated.  Then not long afterward, now that I think about it she could've started this, is when people kept claiming I was wearing ""boy's pants"" which confused me because I still got my jeans from the girl's section.  Maybe the thought jeans were for boys only?  I just remember being yelled that in the bathrooms one day and felt scared and shamed for liking boy's clothes.  After that, I remember trying to be ""girly"".  I tried to get into Barbie and changed my avatar in a game I started to get into called Animal Jam into pinks and purples in an attempt to not be weird and maybe so I will have a boy finally like me.  I used liked wearing black and blues IRL and in-game but I tried to change that to fit in.  The only girly thing I liked was My Littlest Pet Shop if anybody remembers that.

Then puberty came, oh god puberty.  When I started getting breasts I felt extremely uncomfortable.  I remember when one of my close friends at the time pointed them out I just covered them and felt sickened.  I felt like everything was wrong with my body at that moment and instantly was like ""I DO NOT WANT THESE WHAT IS THIS BULLSHITTERY"" and wanted to banish them to the shadow realm.  When I went on a trip across the state to visit family I got my first bras and I felt embarrassed even having to wear them.  I was becoming a ""woman"" but I didn't like it.  My period hit hours before new years in 2011 going into 2012.  I remember seeing the little bit of blood and saying ""MOM, IT STARTED"" and sitting there being told how pads work and I thought ""wtf dude I didn't want this especially when I was trying to celebrate a new year"".  I jokingly told my family ""HAPPY NEW YEAR I'M A WOMAN NOW"" just to make light of the situation.

Jr. high came around and I was in my ""emo"" phase and I finally said enough with the long hair and got a shoulder cut because before it was down to my rear.  I was tired of my long hair.  It felt liberating but I went for more later.  I met this girl, who I thought was a girl.  I saw that because later their true self was a man.  AKA they were FtM and just at the time haven't realized their true self.  They also went through this phase of ""emo"" but had their hair much shorter (I say they because of pre-coming out and still identifying female at this time).  I ended up dating a couple of guys during this time.  One guy, I'm actually still talking to and with no bitterness about our past and he actually came out as bi to me.  At this time I had not come to the realization about my sexuality.  I thought I was ""normal"".  I came to date another guy after that relationship beginning a while after the previous guy moved away.  He... was a dumpster fire and still is to this very day.  While with dumpster-fire-man I realized I also liked women.  I had angerly thought when men wouldn't consider me in the past that maybe I was meant to be with a woman, which was a dumb as all hell though, but I did find out I did find women attractive, go figure.  I thought everybody looked at hot women FFS.  I stayed in the closet for the most part though.  I did kind of hint to it in a Facebook post and he and his family found out I was bisexual but didn't care.

High School came around, dumpster fire and I become on and off briefly before he dumps me for a middle schooler and I found out he was cheating on me.  The only thing I learned about myself at this time is I'm actually pansexual!  Whoo!  Fml.  Jokes on him later though.  I wanted to date a woman but find nobody but a couple of men interested in me, get stood up on a date, frick, somebody else comes instead that was also interested in me since I didn't want to waste all my time getting prepared and looking nice for nothing.  We hit it off but he is a bit of a butthead.  We see a movie after our time at the carnival and we kiss.  Awesome first date.  The next day he invites me over.  ...he did some things I won't forget but stopped him and then he left me that night after refusing to send some compromising photos...  A male friend of mine the day before warned me about him the day we went on our date but I had ignored him.  After realizing my mistake of not listening to him and realizing he was a good friend to me of course I decide to fuck it up by dating him who the hell am I kidding I was a moron.  While with him I cut my hair much shorter to a pixie cut and to what I have today which is a limp faux hawk I guess is what I'd call it.  The top was a bit longer than normal and just flopped onto one side of my head.  I remember his mother hating it saying I had ""a little boy haircut"".  Oh, darkness my old friend, I see you're here again.  His mom ended up hating me for being an Atheist and ruining her son.  Now she no longer hates me since I'm no longer banging her son???  While dating him dumpster-fire-man brought a knife to school, put the whole school into lockdown, and was now in jail for 3 years.  Get rekt scrub.  So yeah, I dated a guy who could've easily become a school shooter wild right?  Did I mention he was in and out of juvie well become this and well before I even dating him?  W I L D   D A Y S   M Y   D U D E S.  

While dating the guy that was a massive momma's boy a video came up on Youtube for me by Ruby Rose.  Break Free.  When I watched it something clicked in my head.  It was like a switch was flipped and it spoke to me.  Watching them go from a pretty woman to a proper man just... resonated with me.  I felt like it just made sense suddenly.  I was gender fluid and just never knew it this whole time.  When getting ready for prom and being forced into a dress to go with momma's boy I remember crying because I hated dresses and his mom made a comment to me that scared me.  When his family asked me what's up I told them I didn't want to wear a dress but didn't include what his mom said to me.  They said ""women are supposed to wear dresses"" and I snapped ""WELL MAYBE I DON'T WANT TO BE A WOMAN"" and they looked at me like I was completely mad and left it at that.

Remember that person I mentioned back in Jr. High that went through an emo phase like me?  Welp, I got close to them and developed a crush, while still heartbroken about my ex leaving me because mommy didn't like me and I didn't put out enough for him (he legit constantly badgered me for sex and 99% of the time gave it to him IDK what you want I'm totally not still bitter).  Well, those two things don't go well together but dating him was an experience.  I think he was a decent guy to date and I feel bad for hurting him.  If you're reading this, my dude, I'm so sorry for what I did and I really hope you're doing better and going along with your transition like you always talked about.  He went on to date a trans guy like himself and saw how happy they were for a while before it went up in flames.  He looked very happy without me.  I had gotten over momma's boy by this point because after leading me on to think we were going to be back together he suddenly went off with a woman he had just started talking to and they are still together to this day.

I met a guy.  He resonated with me when we messaged each other on Discord.  He had reached out to me after a major break up of his that happened to be with a good friend of mine and I had not too long ago dealt with mine.  We bonded over each other mishaps and got to talking.  Then we developed feelings.  Then a friend botched a probe I had her do which gave away that it was me trying to figure out but his answer was he did like me so it didn't matter goddamn it dude why did you have to make it awkward.  We got to dating and this hella intimidating dude was fucking bi.  Da fuq.  So yeah we check out people together which is hella awesome.  

But, this thing looms over me.  G e n d e r.  I was chill with being gender fluid until a while ago when the male feelings got strong and stronger.  For a month straight I felt like a male and was starting to freak out because I thought I had everything figured out.  I even talked to a trans adult in my school and even they were like ""hey maybe you are just a trans man trying to figure things out but you don't need to rush to anything"".  A while later the feelings went back to I can endure being a woman and I mean, I did discover the wonderful world of makeup and I learned most of my tricks from drag queen videos, and I could handle looking kinda feminine in a way of ""I'll stab you if you touch me"" kind of way with dark tank tops, black jackets, and black baggy jeans.  I then yeeted myself into the term transmasculine gender fluid a mouthful.  I still don't feel right.  No matter what words I use I still feel wrong.  They/them pronouns I'm cool with but I hate female words for me and my birth name.  I now have a preferred name that is kinda neutral.  I thought about using my own pronouns a friend of mine had used zey/zim/zir but I have no idea at this point.  I want to see a gender specialist but they are a ways away from here with no car.  I'm 19 now and this journey has been a roller coaster of finding out who I am.  I can say though I'm still with the final guy despite some REALLY rough times we manage.  Doesn't help I have BPD that throws everything into chaos.

My dad and I earlier this year after he had been drinking made some comments that lead to an argument because he said ""people can't just choose what gender they are what day"" and it's like um no we don't choose, it just happens and said that a person he had met at the bar that day (hence why he had the balls to say this) was just ""confused"" and ""I know they really are just a woman"" while I was there.  Bruh.  I ended up screaming at him being like I don't care if that's what you think but you don't talk that way in my presence especially and that what he saying offends me because I'm the same way as they are.  He told me he had no idea why I was taking it so personally and I had screamed ""BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS WHAT I AM"" and I walked out.  I went to a Subway, ate, went to his bar in an attempt to get them to stop serving him but they didn't, called the crisis clinic and just ranted to them, and then my mom called to see if I was okay because she was there when it all went down, and I told her dad could go fuck himself essentially if he thinks he can talk like that around me.  My mom agreed that what he said wasn't right.  I walked all the way back to my mom and I's house halfway across our town.  I'm still angry he said that and that was back in like the Summer.  He doesn't remember I don't think because after it went down he went back to the bar and drank some more and they told him I had stopped by.  He did call my mom that evening saying ""your plan failed"" while sounding shitfaced.  

My gender has been a struggle and having a father who doesn't really support it does make it harder.  I feel like I'm kinda a mix of both but male leaning in ways but IDK.  I just feel like I freaking exist as a blob of male, female, and sometimes nothing that it just drives me mad and makes me hate how my body is built.  I can be a convincing male with effort.  Just I look like I'm a 13-year-old boy which isn't ideal.  I want to be comfortable in my own skin but I haven't since I started experiencing changes.  My boyfriend fully accepts me for whatever I do and my mom... she is like whatever but still calls me my birth name and female pronouns which annoys the hell out of me.  My sister is cool with it and calls me boy words which I'm fine with.  No idea how my brother feels.  My grandma and aunts are fine with it.  Just, I don't feel fine.  Maybe it's because my life is a wreck currently or if something is up.  Sorry for the rant just I feel like a blob of gender.  


TLDR:  
As a kid I felt something was more boyish about me, had a bi boyfriend and this a shit boyfriend but I did learn I was also into girls while with him, dating a new guy and found out I was pansexual and what I thought was maybe gender fluid and cut my hair short, now with a new guy who doesn't care how I identify as and gender became a mess for me, dad became an ass-blasting-bitchaloid that insulted a gender fluid person in front of me resulting in a loud verbal exchange and me walking all the way home, and I still feel like a gender ball of chaos that likes people if they're not fuckers.",genderfluid,Insure About Gender,1576779012.0,"{'created_utc': 1576753812, 'id': 'ecrsqf', 'num_comments': 1, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Warning profanity and some triggering situations and just REALLY long and ranty TLDR at the end for ya\'lls sakes.\n\nI have no idea what I am at this point.  I just know being female is not 100% my thing by any means.  I had a hunch something was up since I was a child.  I loved playing with the boys more than girls, not to say I didn\'t socialize with women, because I did, just I enjoyed the fun boys had than girls.  I just understood them better.  They didn\'t care about gossip and chattering but going out and causing havoc.  To the point where I even said ""I feel like I should\'ve been a boy but something went wrong halfway through"", I was maybe 8 at the time of saying this.  I always played with male toys.  I loved dinosaurs for as long as I can remember which later evolved into my love of dragons after discovering the Legend of Spyro series.  I even recall picking up a snake at one point and scaring one of my friends with it.  I loved getting my close in the boy\'s section because I believed they had better shirts for the most part and fit better.  I remember my mom decided to get boxers because I had issues with my thighs chafing and women\'s boxers weren\'t in our store, at least at the time, so we got men\'s.  \n\nOne of my female friends found out, she was an awful girl and I have no idea why I was friends with her, she is still a cunt in my book, but she saw the underwear when bending over or something and yelled I was wearing boys underwear and grabbed the back of my underwear and gave me a wedgy.  I felt... violated.  Then not long afterward, now that I think about it she could\'ve started this, is when people kept claiming I was wearing ""boy\'s pants"" which confused me because I still got my jeans from the girl\'s section.  Maybe the thought jeans were for boys only?  I just remember being yelled that in the bathrooms one day and felt scared and shamed for liking boy\'s clothes.  After that, I remember trying to be ""girly"".  I tried to get into Barbie and changed my avatar in a game I started to get into called Animal Jam into pinks and purples in an attempt to not be weird and maybe so I will have a boy finally like me.  I used liked wearing black and blues IRL and in-game but I tried to change that to fit in.  The only girly thing I liked was My Littlest Pet Shop if anybody remembers that.\n\nThen puberty came, oh god puberty.  When I started getting breasts I felt extremely uncomfortable.  I remember when one of my close friends at the time pointed them out I just covered them and felt sickened.  I felt like everything was wrong with my body at that moment and instantly was like ""I DO NOT WANT THESE WHAT IS THIS BULLSHITTERY"" and wanted to banish them to the shadow realm.  When I went on a trip across the state to visit family I got my first bras and I felt embarrassed even having to wear them.  I was becoming a ""woman"" but I didn\'t like it.  My period hit hours before new years in 2011 going into 2012.  I remember seeing the little bit of blood and saying ""MOM, IT STARTED"" and sitting there being told how pads work and I thought ""wtf dude I didn\'t want this especially when I was trying to celebrate a new year"".  I jokingly told my family ""HAPPY NEW YEAR I\'M A WOMAN NOW"" just to make light of the situation.\n\nJr. high came around and I was in my ""emo"" phase and I finally said enough with the long hair and got a shoulder cut because before it was down to my rear.  I was tired of my long hair.  It felt liberating but I went for more later.  I met this girl, who I thought was a girl.  I saw that because later their true self was a man.  AKA they were FtM and just at the time haven\'t realized their true self.  They also went through this phase of ""emo"" but had their hair much shorter (I say they because of pre-coming out and still identifying female at this time).  I ended up dating a couple of guys during this time.  One guy, I\'m actually still talking to and with no bitterness about our past and he actually came out as bi to me.  At this time I had not come to the realization about my sexuality.  I thought I was ""normal"".  I came to date another guy after that relationship beginning a while after the previous guy moved away.  He... was a dumpster fire and still is to this very day.  While with dumpster-fire-man I realized I also liked women.  I had angerly thought when men wouldn\'t consider me in the past that maybe I was meant to be with a woman, which was a dumb as all hell though, but I did find out I did find women attractive, go figure.  I thought everybody looked at hot women FFS.  I stayed in the closet for the most part though.  I did kind of hint to it in a Facebook post and he and his family found out I was bisexual but didn\'t care.\n\nHigh School came around, dumpster fire and I become on and off briefly before he dumps me for a middle schooler and I found out he was cheating on me.  The only thing I learned about myself at this time is I\'m actually pansexual!  Whoo!  Fml.  Jokes on him later though.  I wanted to date a woman but find nobody but a couple of men interested in me, get stood up on a date, frick, somebody else comes instead that was also interested in me since I didn\'t want to waste all my time getting prepared and looking nice for nothing.  We hit it off but he is a bit of a butthead.  We see a movie after our time at the carnival and we kiss.  Awesome first date.  The next day he invites me over.  ...he did some things I won\'t forget but stopped him and then he left me that night after refusing to send some compromising photos...  A male friend of mine the day before warned me about him the day we went on our date but I had ignored him.  After realizing my mistake of not listening to him and realizing he was a good friend to me of course I decide to fuck it up by dating him who the hell am I kidding I was a moron.  While with him I cut my hair much shorter to a pixie cut and to what I have today which is a limp faux hawk I guess is what I\'d call it.  The top was a bit longer than normal and just flopped onto one side of my head.  I remember his mother hating it saying I had ""a little boy haircut"".  Oh, darkness my old friend, I see you\'re here again.  His mom ended up hating me for being an Atheist and ruining her son.  Now she no longer hates me since I\'m no longer banging her son???  While dating him dumpster-fire-man brought a knife to school, put the whole school into lockdown, and was now in jail for 3 years.  Get rekt scrub.  So yeah, I dated a guy who could\'ve easily become a school shooter wild right?  Did I mention he was in and out of juvie well become this and well before I even dating him?  W I L D   D A Y S   M Y   D U D E S.  \n\nWhile dating the guy that was a massive momma\'s boy a video came up on Youtube for me by Ruby Rose.  Break Free.  When I watched it something clicked in my head.  It was like a switch was flipped and it spoke to me.  Watching them go from a pretty woman to a proper man just... resonated with me.  I felt like it just made sense suddenly.  I was gender fluid and just never knew it this whole time.  When getting ready for prom and being forced into a dress to go with momma\'s boy I remember crying because I hated dresses and his mom made a comment to me that scared me.  When his family asked me what\'s up I told them I didn\'t want to wear a dress but didn\'t include what his mom said to me.  They said ""women are supposed to wear dresses"" and I snapped ""WELL MAYBE I DON\'T WANT TO BE A WOMAN"" and they looked at me like I was completely mad and left it at that.\n\nRemember that person I mentioned back in Jr. High that went through an emo phase like me?  Welp, I got close to them and developed a crush, while still heartbroken about my ex leaving me because mommy didn\'t like me and I didn\'t put out enough for him (he legit constantly badgered me for sex and 99% of the time gave it to him IDK what you want I\'m totally not still bitter).  Well, those two things don\'t go well together but dating him was an experience.  I think he was a decent guy to date and I feel bad for hurting him.  If you\'re reading this, my dude, I\'m so sorry for what I did and I really hope you\'re doing better and going along with your transition like you always talked about.  He went on to date a trans guy like himself and saw how happy they were for a while before it went up in flames.  He looked very happy without me.  I had gotten over momma\'s boy by this point because after leading me on to think we were going to be back together he suddenly went off with a woman he had just started talking to and they are still together to this day.\n\nI met a guy.  He resonated with me when we messaged each other on Discord.  He had reached out to me after a major break up of his that happened to be with a good friend of mine and I had not too long ago dealt with mine.  We bonded over each other mishaps and got to talking.  Then we developed feelings.  Then a friend botched a probe I had her do which gave away that it was me trying to figure out but his answer was he did like me so it didn\'t matter goddamn it dude why did you have to make it awkward.  We got to dating and this hella intimidating dude was fucking bi.  Da fuq.  So yeah we check out people together which is hella awesome.  \n\nBut, this thing looms over me.  G e n d e r.  I was chill with being gender fluid until a while ago when the male feelings got strong and stronger.  For a month straight I felt like a male and was starting to freak out because I thought I had everything figured out.  I even talked to a trans adult in my school and even they were like ""hey maybe you are just a trans man trying to figure things out but you don\'t need to rush to anything"".  A while later the feelings went back to I can endure being a woman and I mean, I did discover the wonderful world of makeup and I learned most of my tricks from drag queen videos, and I could handle looking kinda feminine in a way of ""I\'ll stab you if you touch me"" kind of way with dark tank tops, black jackets, and black baggy jeans.

Obviously with being genderfluid comes, well, fluidity. Sometimes *weeks* will go by when I lean more to one gender than the other (so for like three weeks, I may be fine with my female body, or for a month, I'll really, really feel like I want to go through HRT, and present more masc.) Sometimes it changes at the drop of a fcking hat, where my desires will change a few times a day. 

When I'm feeling femme, I want the long hair, girlier fashion, and to be a gorgeous girl. On masc days, I want jeans, and band tees, and short, choppy, punky hair.   
It's expensive enough to deal with one gender, let alone two. Quality wigs are $30+, and the thrift stores near me aren't much cheaper than shopping at Walmart. Especially since I live a super minimum wage life (I live with my dad who takes care of the stuff I need to live, like meds, food, bills, that fun stuff), so I can barely afford to take care of one person, let alone what feels like taking care of two.

2019-12-26 05:07:45,efr6x1,2,1,"There's a lot I'm about to to unpack here but if you're willing/able to delve through it, I need help. Thank you and sorry in advance.

I've been seriously questioning my gender for the past 4ish months. I present completely female right now and I've identified as a cis lesbian for the past four years. However, I've always felt subconsciously not right, never fit in with other girls, and had lots of past experiences that I now see as suspiciously eggy. Where I stand now, I don't even know if I'm cis or not yet.

My feelings really do strongly and wildly fluctuate. Here's my breakdown:

* 40% of days: I'm completely fine presenting as female, though I've never been particularly feminine.
* 30% of days: In-between days where I'm not sure but I don't feel completely right as a girl.
* 30% of days: I get so happy when I bind and dress masc. On those days, I'd like more than anything to be out as a boy or enby. I want so badly to be Jack, he/him or they/them, instead of Daisy**\*** and she/her. 
* *^(\*birth name changed for privacy)*

I don't want to self-diagnose but I think I sometimes experience dysphoria on my most masculine days- mostly social, some physical. However, there are some days when I feel fine how I am and wouldn't change it. When I'm feeling cis, I'm really good at straight-up denying that I've ever felt anything non-cis. Finally, there are the days that confuse me the most. These are the days when- even though I'm feeling just fine being cis- I still get so happy when I bind/dress masc/etc. On these days, after I take everything off and go back to presenting female, I miss presenting masc but I'm completely okay going back to female.

Now to throw another wrench in:

I know I only like girls. The thing is, whenever I think of being with a girl, I always think of our relationship dynamic being queer. I feel more feminine when I think of myself in a relationship with a girl. Even when I'm at my most masc, I'd never want to be the masculine figure in a relationship.

And finally, my own personal fears!

I'm so scared of identifying as genderfluid because most people I know either doesn't know what it is or thinks it's bullshit. I just want one static identity- cis girl, trans man, nonbinary, I don't care. I want to be comfortably open as me in my own life. I just don't want to be genderfluid. 

Like I said, I don't even know if I'm cis or not yet, but even on my most cis-feeling days, I catch myself thinking ""oh, I would never be able to transition right now. I'll just wait until \[*x* thing happens\]. I can just stick it out a few more years, right?"" This is a stark contrast to the rest of what I feel when I'm feeling cis, which is straight-up denying that I've ever had any non-cis feelings.

I've chased myself in circles questioning. Can anyone help me make sense of my own feelings?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Autistic masking is a phenomena that begins very young in an autistic person’s life, with studies suggesting that it may begin in infancy.   They begin to imitate and memorize the behaviors of others in speech and  mannerisms, attempting to be more “normal.”  Most of masking behaviors  are unconscious, that is the person is not aware they are masking until  they learn they are autistic and what it means to [mask](https://theaspergian.com/glossary/mask/).   It is a survival mechanism, and an awareness that being different is a  threat to ones’ safety, autonomy, and right to be heard.

I am a self-diagnosed autistic, gender-questioning, AFAB adult. Although I am quite certain I'm not a man, I definitely don't feel like a woman at all times, either. 

At this point, masking comes to me as naturally as breathing, and I don't always realize whether I am doing it or if something is a natural vs learned response. When I encounter an unfamiliar situation, my internal reaction is very much along the lines of ""I don't have a script for this!"" When I am in a familiar situation, though, my script and its accompanying speech and mannerisms usually has a gender associated with it. For example, my initial script for helping people with computer problems leaned analytical and male, probably because that is the gender of the person I copied it from. (The add-on adventurous ""poke it with a stick just to see what the hell happens"" approach to troubleshooting seems to be the part that is genuinely me.) Situations related to hospitality (cooking, making coffee, preparing ritual space) feel female.

2019-12-30 10:17:27,ehkdfu,1,1,"Soooo. I'm a 18 year old physically female person.

I've been trying to find my genderidentity for a good few years now, and I'm just constantly uncomfortable and confused. I've labeled myself as FtM transgender, androgynous, genderfluid, genderqueer, and even considered non-binary. I generally feel most strongly that I am FtM transgender, and generally label myself as such.

 Pronouns don't really matter to me much, or stuff like that, the biggest problem I have is with my body, what to do with it and how to dress. I've noticed that I have a weird view of transitioning, and am generally quite scared about how my relatives will react. I generally have a big fear of being judged. I'm very aware and feel discouraged by the fact that transgender men lack things that naturally born men have. And it makes me feel very dysphoric. It feels like a qrotesque mess of an attempt of being a man. I feel like, if I was born a man, everything would be fine or at least a lot better. I could enjoy all the pleasures of being a man, dress cute if I want and not be misgendered, and never have to struggle with body image. Now I've become very sex positive as I've matured and it bothers me a lot that I wouldn't be able to feel what a prostate does for men, or even generally feel nearly as much pleasure in general. 

I have a need to be viewed as perfect or very well put together. This messes me a lot when dealing with my gender-identity. And a big part of it consist of my style choice. Now, I'm pretty sure I'm some sort of genderfluid, or perhaps something more mild like cross-dressing and such. Anyhow, I like feminine style of clothing a lot, as well as long hair and being able to style it in complicated ways. But I also like masculine clothes, I generally dress more masculine as my casual wear, but they could go on any gender. I fear a lot that I would be misgendered a lot if I were to wear wigs with long hair, and dresses and such, after I transition and it confuses me a lot as to why it frightens me so much. I generally have quite a little dysphoria or so I've thought, I don't really feel that uncomfortable in my body, but now I feel like I've been thinking that it would be a very physical feeling, when in reality it might not be so. I just generally have a really hard time adjusting to the thought of labeling myself, and accepting myself under a label. I have this image, I have this need, to be 100% sure of my identity and not being in control or understanding of my own identity makes me feel invalid.
