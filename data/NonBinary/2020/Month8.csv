I’m AFAB, but I’ve been really leaning toward a more masculine identity. 

I’ve finally come to the conclusion that I identify as masculine, but would like to present as feminine: it came to me as I found myself envious of men, predominantly men in the gay community, who hold true to their male identity and also dress up in skirts/dresses, makeup, wigs, heels, etc. They’re still men, but express themselves in a very feminine way. I understand that the term f*mboy has a very problematic history, but I find myself aligning with people who use the term in its more present day context to describe themselves (specifically on tik tok)

The reason I have the support flair is because I’d love to hear from other enbies who align with this or something like it. It’s been a bit of a struggle for me to remember that identity and expression are two different facets, so I’ve been having a hard time accepting myself.

2020-08-02 11:29:15,i2al7c,4,1,"Hi y'all. It is my first post.

I'm amab, late thirties, have a family (wife and kid).

I am not yet sure, what I am. I think genderfluid. I am thoroughly confused right now and feel lots of body dysphoria.

I am not sure when it started for me. I think after puberty - then gradually increasing feeling of wanting to know what it would feel like to be a woman, esp. female sexualitiy. 
I think I felt dysphoria, too - but I had no word for it.

I experimented with eyeliner and eyeshadow, long hair during my ""gothic phase"" but also did like to take ""cute photos"" of me and tried a time without beard - which I quickly grew back after the reactions from my environment.

Sexually the longing for feeling female reached its height somewhere in my mid twenties. But I never shared that with anyone. I was already with my wife at the time.

I started to repress all these feelings after I got pretty sure I was not interested in men.

I did not have the concept that there could be such a thing as a ""trans lesbian"". Also I felt pretty good as a man, too for some times.

But in retrospect I know the sentence ""My real self sometimes is a lesbian girl"" did quite often go through my head.

All this came back to me when I started to think deeply about why I was so offended by bashing of ""all cis males"" in twitter while simultaneously agreeing to lots of what was said. I so did not want to be lumped in with all the men who made my life a living hell some times.

When I finally was able to talk openly about my feelings in therapy for the first time everything intensified. Shortly after I was able to tell a close friend which was amazing, since she reacted very positively and supportive.

At the moment I feel like I would like to shave everything (legs, beard, chest), dress like a girl and maybe even do hormone therapy. But this could be just a phase.

I experimented a bit with FaceApp and often I find myself really cute even without the ""gender change"", just ""shaved"" and a bit of makeup look really sweet and girly. I have long hair, so that's a plus 😉

So, that's me. As I am now at this point in time.

Heya!

I’m an AFAB non binary person, and I’m currently doing as much research as possible about my transition options. I know I want top surgery 100%, but I don’t want to fully medically transition to a binary man. 

I originally thought that I didn’t want to take testosterone because it might give me more drastic results than I want, but I have seen a few people mention “low dose” Testosterone to get more neutral results (voice, hair, face, body etc)

I know the results are a dice roll, but if anybody here has any experience with this, that would be amazing.",NonBinary,“Low Dose” Testosterone Therapy,1596411751.0,"{'created_utc': 1596386551, 'id': 'i2f40c', 'num_comments': 8, 'score': 1, 'selftext': '\nCW: Surgery and Hormones  \n\n\nHeya!\n\nI’m an AFAB non binary person, and I’m currently doing as much research as possible about my transition options.

I found myself in quite a pickle and decided to ask the fellow people of the internet for some further guidance. 

So, in short, I am a AFAB person, identifying as NB since I remember. I have always wondered about low dosing T, and since a couple of months before, I decided to give it a go. In my country everything is a long and HELLA daunting process, most of the doctors you deal with have no idea about low dosing T, being non binary, trans or whatever.

Of course since the whole process is a pain in the ass I began questioning myself. Do I really need it? Is it gonna make me happy? 
I know I cant pick and choose changes and so I am additionally stressed.

How does anyone know if this is the right thing for them? 

I think my goal would to present less feminine, especially physique wise - wait for the fat redistribution, praise some easier muscle gain etc. (Not mentioning the loss of menses (omg yes)).

My gf is worried I am going too fast and I should wait. She thinks I decided on her due to my recent weight gain (my hips, ass, thighs and breasts increased.quite a bit.).

Any tips would be great,

Hey, this is my first post on this Subreddit and please excuse that my english is not the greatest.

First you have to know that I'm labeling and feeling myself as nonbinary for some time now and I had some dysphoria here and there but not as much that I would want to change things immediately or that it would me bother me that much. 

Some days before (like 1 and a half week) I had a dream where I transitioned mtf and I actually liked it a lot while I dreamed but also after I waked up.

After that dream I was pretty unsure about anything and it also remembered me at my thoughts at the age of 16 or so where I layed in bed and wished I would wake up as a girl next day (Sadly that never happened + you must know that I knew nothing about Queer stuff back then and the only queer person I knew was some bi dude at my school). 
I thought a lot about it after I waked up which is pretty ok. But sadly I felt and still feel a loooot more disphoric since then. Since this dream I'm thinking a lot more about my gender identity, I want to change some stuff at my appearance immediately like clothes and I started voice training with some YouTube videos (thanks TranceVoiceLessons).

This all would be great if there wouldnt be the doubt in my mind. It tells me that I just feel that way cause I read a lot about queer stuff and have a lot of friends, just want to feel special or want to be part of a community. I think so much about it that it makes me exhausted and I can't participate in a lot of social   happenings with my flatmates and stuff. And it kinda kicked me back in a depressed mood I just had overcome.

I still think it's strange that I feel that way through a dream... I really need some thoughts on this whole thing.

One more wholesome thing: I talked to some of my friends about that and nearly all of them reacted pretty supportive. :)

2020-08-03 05:54:39,i2roon,7,1,"Hello there..  
I should say I'm male, but I don't really know what I am anymore. It's all incredibly scary/exciting. *(Also, this post is the very first time I have identified myself as male on the internet and there's a good chance I might edit this post later to get rid of that).*  
I realised something about myself when I first spent an hour in Skyrim's character creator years ago and ended up with a female elf. I don't know why that's what I made, I suppose I liked the idea of being a female elf at the time. Then I played Mass Effect and surprise, I've only ever been femshep. Then I tried the Witcher and I was a little disappointed that I had to be Geralt and he had to be a guy..  
I'd like to say that it's just something I do in videogames and this wasn't serving as an outlet, but I'd be lying to myself and I'm terrible at that. *(I don't know what's happening, am I a trans person?)*  
But then I played Destiny and this time I could choose to be a robot, and that absolutely blew my mind. 'Wait, I don't have to be either? Uh.. ok, let's try that.'  
Then, bear with me, Pacific Rim. They showed us giant robots with kickass names being driven by both girls and boys? In their heads? Sometimes at the same time?? (I should mention, I found myself using Pacific Rim a lot to discuss LGBT issues with some friends and relatives. I don't know if anybody's thought of it that way or if it even works or not, but it makes a lot of sense to me).  
Then I saw Altered Carbon and I have to say, I don't know if there's anything I've ever seen that smacked me harder in the face with my uncertain identity. A sci fi world where your body isn't strictly your only body? (Yes, I'm really looking forward to Cyberpunk)  
I feel like I've been incredibly vague in this post, and I apologise for that. The echoes have been growing louder and louder in my head and it's literally in the last couple of weeks that they've become impossible for me to ignore and that's what's led me here. I just never dreamed that I'd fall this far down the rabbit hole.  
(Maybe I'm here just for this one post, but I hope I'll stick around because you guys inspire me with your rock solid confidence).  
I don't quite know what it means to be non binary, I'm not even sure if I have the right to just call myself that, and honestly I don't think I need to. It doesn't really matter to me what category I should fall under (that's the idea, I guess), but it really does matter what I think of myself.  
So what does this mean? Am I non binary? Should pronouns still matter to me? Will I end up wanting to change my name to something less male? Am I going to start a very slow subconscious transformation into my most androgynous form? (what the hell am I saying..) And won't I have to answer questions about this?

It's all incredibly scary/exciting. *(Also, this post is the very first time I have identified myself as male on the internet and there's a good chance I might edit this post later to get rid of that).*  \nI realised something about myself when I first spent an hour in Skyrim's character creator years ago and ended up with a female elf. I don't know why that's what I made, I suppose I liked the idea of being a female elf at the time. Then I played Mass Effect and surprise, I've only ever been femshep.

Sometimes at the same time?? (I should mention, I found myself using Pacific Rim a lot to discuss LGBT issues with some friends and relatives. I don't know if anybody's thought of it that way or if it even works or not, but it makes a lot of sense to me).  \nThen I saw Altered Carbon and I have to say, I don't know if there's anything I've ever seen that smacked me harder in the face with my uncertain identity. A sci fi world where your body isn't strictly your only body? (Yes, I'm really looking forward to Cyberpunk)  \nI feel like I've been incredibly vague in this post, and I apologise for that.

2020-08-03 10:15:05,i2uhuv,7,1,"Hi guys, I'm a designer at an architecture firm and I'm tryin to gather information about how design influences gender, and how architecture effects people who identify themselves outside of the typical gemder binary. 

For example here in NY we can label bathrooms that are gender neutral in ways that are more friendly to people who identify outside of the male / female symbols being used. 

I was wondering what other spaces or areas that are gender specific that you think puts you in a position that makes you feel out of place. 

And it doesn't have to be for example like dressing rooms or restrooms but it can be simply the idea of color being used in a space to represent masculinity or feminine.

For example people who don't identify as male or female, if you're shopping for clothing do you find those places that have specific sections like men's / women's to be dated? Can there be ways to intertwine these things, should we? Should there be a non-binary section?

Anything to do with designed spaces, could even be a waiting room, there is no wrong answer.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

The thing that made me start to question my gender was the fact that ever since I was a child I would experience this painful feeling of discomfort that had to do with wearing “feminine” clothing...in this case when I wore something like a tank top. My dysphoric feelings mostly center around my chest area, and it causes me a great deal of discomfort and even nausea. As I grew older I felt that wearing more masculine clothing was what I wanted...and that it would be most comfortable (I just wanted to dress that way because I thought it looked cool) but I found that I still felt “not right”...not completely comfortable. I still felt kind of weird. I recently found that I need a mixture and pretty much a balance between masc and fem clothing/appearance in order to be comfortable ...at least that’s what I think so far. But I am still unable to feel totally comfortable and I think this is because of my hair...it’s super thick, big, and long and I want a buzz cut so bad as I feel it will serve as a balance between masc. and fem. for me. However I’m terrified that the haircut will be TOO masculine for me personally and at that point it will be too late. I truly feel that cutting my hair will make me more comfortable. As for gender identity...I’m unsure. I sometimes feel that I wish I was born male...I don’t actually feel like one. I just wish I was one. In my case I wish I was a male that looked like a girl. I don’t know if I necessarily don’t feel like a girl...I’m unsure...I just know that I don’t want to be one and am unsatisfied with being a she/lady/ma’am/woman. I want nothing to do with it. I feel like a fake and a fraud because I know some people actually feel it inside that they aren’t a woman, and I’m scared that I am one and that I’m just being extra or am just unable to except it...I almost completely hate having a “biologically female body. I hate having boobs, thick-ish thighs, perky-ish butt. My ideal body would be sorta of like a cute, petite, skinny little boy. I find that I feel in tune with masc/femininity at times. I am able to feel intune with the masc when listening to certain music and I’m practically radiating in it. Or if I imagine my ideal self/hair. I sometimes feel more feminine when In an emotional state, whether that be super happy or super sad. I started thinking about pronouns yesterday, as I’m not satisfied with she/her. I’ve never felt dysphoric about pronouns, but I’m not satisfied. I thought about he/him last night while listening to some bomb music and basically squealed at how it felt to think of myself as he/him. I even wrote about myself in 3rd person to test it. I didn’t choose these pronouns to identify as male, but to identify somewhere under the non binary umbrella but choose he/him pronouns. So I wouldn’t be a boy or a sir. But then I started thinking...maybe I can be that “petite little boy” image I like, and be a “feminine little boy” I loved it. But I’m not sure it’s “me” entirely, I don’t feel like a boy necessarily especially since at the moment I feel more in tune with my femininity. Im also not sure  if the he/him pronouns are for me and it felt best in that moment that I was in tune with the masc., but my appearance doesn’t help. I feel like a  “girl”. Like this body is literally female and I feel almost caged and cornered. I felt that the haircut and the he/him pronouns would be all the masc. balance necessary for me. If anything I may go by they/them as I’m starting to warm up to and become more comfortable/sort of familiar with that. I don’t know what to do and I keep worrying that I’m a fraud. I don’t really know what it means to be a woman. I don’t necessarily know what that should feel like in order to determine that I am one and I’m so afraid. I tried the gender unicorn and was stumped at the identity section. I don’t know if I feel female or male. I feel like I may be non binary. I think my problem is that I keep thinking about my appearance as of right now and that influences the way I feel. I guess I feel non-binary. But I’m even scared to say that cause I’m afraid that that’s not the case. I feel happiest in my “masculine moments” just imagining how I might want to look. I know for a fact I want to go for a “blended” look, in such a way that you wouldn’t be sure if I was a girl or just a “petite, feminine little boy”. I don’t hate feeling feminine though. It’s what I feel most of the time, or like a feminine/neutral state. I just feel the most bliss and joy with the masculine sparks.

I feel so wrong when I look at my face in the mirror. I feel like im looking at someone else. Im also very uncomfortable with whats ""down there"" but for the sake of keeping this SFW i wont get into that.

I really dont feel its just self consciousness. I dont want to look this much like a girl but I dont want to look like a boy either. I enjoy wearing both girlish and boyish clothing. My interests are all over the place. The feelings I have are really intense and make me very stressed and depressed. I dont want to look like this. 

Im honestly glad my breasts are small? I feel like id be dysphoric if they were bigger. 

Gender is such a mystery to me, especially mine. I dont like to see myself as boy or girl. I dont like when people treat me like im a girl too much. I guess im fine with female pronouns? But I think id rather be called they instead, or maybe something else.

Ive always felt this way, to the point that my parents had to force me to get girly clothing when I was a kid because if I had the choice Id mostly only wear tshirts and jeans or shorts. 

A few trans people Ive talked to say you cant have dysphoria and also not be the other binary gender. I dont want to be a boy but my feelings are real. I dont like being told what my feelings are or arent. I know what im feeling. 

But im not sure what to do with these feelings. Transitioning wouldnt work because looking like a boy would upset me just as much if not more. 

Plus theres the concern on whether Im allowed to refer to myself as trans. I dont feel right calling myself cis because that kinda feels like im misgendering myself. But others say I dont count since Im not afab transitioning to male or something. 

A good chunk of this is me desperately looking for validation and someone who understands what im going through. I cannot be the only one with feelings like this. But I feel so weird and alone on this. Often I find myself invalidating myself and fearing that i just want to be trans or that im just confused. Then I just spiral into more self hate and pain.

2020-08-05 20:47:27,i4dipx,0,1,"I've (16, afab) been trying to figure out a new name for myself because my birth name is super feminine and traditional, but there's no way to shorten it at all. Thing is I want to have a ""rEgulAr"", common name because there's less of a chance that I'll outgrow and such. As much as I would love to have a really Powerful enby name like Stick or something, I haven't found one that I love, identify with, and that people could respect and take seriously.

I've tried to discuss names with my friends and to get suggestions that suit me but  aside from one, nothing great has really come up. I do however have four names that have been on my mind for a long time, before I even identified as NB. I want a more masculine leaning name to offset how feminine I look. For years I would sometimes try to  think of a more gender neutral or masculine name for myself, and those are the favourites that always stayed at the back of my mind.

The problem is though, that the three names I like the most are the names of some of my older (19) sister's friends. She has one male friend with one of my potential names, though she isn't super close to him so it probably wouldn't cause many problems or for long. Another is the chosen name of her own NB friend, and though that's the name I've liked for the longest they are quite close and I kind of know them myself. The third name that I've liked for years, and coincidentally is the suggested favourite of one of my best friends, is a variation of my sister's boyfriend's name.

Thing is I want to have a ""rEgulAr"", common name because there\'s less of a chance that I\'ll outgrow and such. As much as I would love to have a really Powerful enby name like Stick or something, I haven\'t found one that I love, identify with, and that people could respect and take seriously.\n\nI\'ve tried to discuss names with my friends and to get suggestions that suit me but  aside from one, nothing great has really come up. I do however have four names that have been on my mind for a long time, before I even identified as NB. I want a more masculine leaning name to offset how feminine I look. For years I would sometimes try to  think of a more gender neutral or masculine name for myself, and those are the favourites that always stayed at the back of my mind.\n\nThe problem is though, that the three names I like the most are the names of some of my older (19) sister\'s friends. She has one male friend with one of my potential names, though she isn\'t super close to him so it probably wouldn\'t cause many problems or for long. Another is the chosen name of her own NB friend, and though that\'s the name I\'ve liked for the longest they are quite close and I kind of know them myself. The third name that I\'ve liked for years, and coincidentally is the suggested favourite of one of my best friends, is a variation of my sister\'s boyfriend\'s name.

I relatively recently discovered that I'm enby, I was okay with my birthname at first, but now I'm getting more and more uncomfortable with it to the point I'm considering a new name. Nothing much has really clicked (except for one I'll get to that in a moment) with me yet because every name always seems to feel more masculine/more feminine to me, which is not my goal. I do have one name that's really clicked with me, though, and it's Frankie. It's perfect, I feel like a Frankie, it feels perfectly gender neutral to me, I look like a Frankie (imo), so everything should be great, right? Not exactly. See, I'm half-Spanish, and I am therefore really attached to that side of me (my birthname is Spanish after all), and on top of that, I regularly talk with my family in Spanish. So, I want a name that my family can easily pronounce. But, my problem is whenever I look at gender neutral Spanish names, all of them still feel so gendered, no matter how neutral they are. I think it's because of the o's and a's, thar really make them feel more masc/more fem. So, you can see the predicament I'm in. Does anyone have any thoughts on the matter, or what I should do?

The weather is starting to warm up, and we only have MREs to eat. But this post isn't about the struggle of rations or the lack of a shower it's about being non-binary in a structure that requires conformance to binary gender ideals. 

But first let's start with a few positive things, that are nice as an Non commissioned officer.....it's yes Sergeant, no Sergeant from my subordinates, and my surname is all anyone uses (since I particularly fond of my surname it's great). But beyond this small bit nongendered formality lies a greater struggle. 

Currently, the army only recognizes male and female (and you can no longer transition, thanks Trump) so if you feel any other way you have to accept what you are assigned at birth will determine a few key facet's of your time in the military. From grooming standards (mainly the hair on top of your head) to physical fitness standards (though these are changing) and even your weight and body fat standards. 

Presenting, a gender neutral can be a struggle depending on what you feel you need to meet those criteria. Ie, in my case I  may present more femme to compensate for my masculine build with maybe a bit of mascara to change my eye shape, and different under clothes depending on feeling. But the one thing about the uniform is that it is a literal tent some days and your body composition underneath doesn't matter. 

For all the army wants to be about conformance, shouldn't the ideal be to be a soldier? Not to worry about the gender of that person but how they are as a soldier, the conformance to the principals and ethics is more important than how I feel I need to present my self. Does my need to microdose estrogen in order to feel good about my self affect my ability to train and lead troops. Indirectly maybe but directly no.

One day the world will understand that the binary gender construct is not a threat to morality, but a boom to free flowing society that has come to understand that how someone chooses to present is their choice, but that choice isn't a direct reflection of their morality, ethics, or capabilities.

I am a cisgender guy, and I would consider myself like 95% straight with one exception: I've been attracted to some AFAB nonbinary people. I suppose I'm romantically and sexually interested in people who have similar interests/hobbies and a vagina (sorry if that's slightly crass).

At least by my understanding, that makes me not entirely straight, which I don't really mind, but I do have a few questions about it.

Is there an existing label for my orientation, or is ""mostly straight"" the best way to describe it?

I’m a 30 AFAB enby and have been with my partner for about six years. I came out to him as nonbinary a couple months ago.  He has been quite supportive of my exploring, but also a bit disengaged.

Basically, I think my partner doesn’t totally get why it matters that I’m enby. And he keeps harping on the fact that I was born female.
On the one hand I’m glad he understands the distinction between sex and gender. But I’ve exaplined to him that I’m not a woman.

Any tips for this? We are at a weird spot in our relationship. I want him to affirm me as a non binary person. He seems to not understand why it matters as much since it doesn’t affect like...I dunno.

And having him with me helps immensely—but only up to a point.\n\nSo I’m reaching out to my fellow gentlefolk to ask not just if anyone has had a similar experience, but how you dealt with it.

I wanted some advice for coming out to family/co-workers.

So I’m (afab) non binary (possibly gender fluid or gender queer I haven’t found the right language yet). I’m also an out and proud lesbian. 

My family and co workers know that I’m a lesbian, and that my girlfriend is a trans woman, and there are no issues there. 

They’re all used to me going back and forth between presenting really femme and really butch, and I think it’s always just been understood as me being eclectically queer.

I’m meeting with a trans focused doctor and a councillor soon because I know for sure that I want top surgery. I’ve recently started to bind (although not properly because my binders are in the mail) and a few people have picked up on it (my friends). I’m also thinking about starting a low dose of testosterone, but that one is up for discussion. 

I don’t mind telling my friends, because 99% of them fall somewhere on the LGBTQ+ spectrum, and understand that gender and sexuality can be completely fluid and that there’s no rush to put labels on it.

My family and co workers however might have a harder time understanding, and I don’t know how to use the right language to explain it to them, if that makes sense. 

I’m keeping my name, and She/Her pronouns, and as silly as it sounds, I’m afraid it will be somewhat invalidating for people to possibly shrug off my trans/non binary identity.

Assigned gender at birth is kind of like your first car - generally its what you luck into, and you may or may not like it. There are many reasons why someone may like that car, or not think about it enough to wonder about maybe getting a different car.

Gender identity (binary, non-binary, agender, demi, etc.) is caring about what car you drive. Some people don’t care, some people *really care*, and there are many layers in between. Some people like one kind of car, some people like all kinds of cars. Some people change what kind of car they want - sometimes changing from day to day.

Dysphoria seems kind of like having to drive a mini van because of needing to haul a bunch of people around, but not enjoying the mini van. Maybe you’d be happier with a vehicle with different features, or that presents a different image like a big SUV that still seats the same number of people.

Sexual orientation is caring what car your partner drives.

\-bind

\-keep hair relatively short

Hi there, everyone. I'm 21 years old and I have recently come to the realization that I'm genderfluid. I've been exploring what that means to me and I find my dysphoria and ideals clashing at many times. Let me explain.

So I was assigned male at birth and therefore have a pretty masculine body and so, of course, there are times when I want to present as more feminine. This, for me, would sometimes include wearing things such as breast forms and hips padding to give the illusion of a more hourglass type figure. 

Where my gripe lies is in the fact that I'm unsure whether I'm doing this just for my own satisfaction or because it's what a more ""womanly"" body is expected and idealized to be and, therefore, it makes me feel better when I want to be perceived as more feminine. But I also think that, in the end, who's to say that my body isn't a womanly body, even without the padding?

I would never shame anyone for modifying their body in any way.  I just  feel like I'm betraying the idea that ""If you are a woman, you have a woman's body,"" etc. and surrendering to the societal ideal feminine body. It's just that when I wear the padding and other accoutrement, it scratches some itch that I couldn't scratch otherwise. 

I'm really confused and I would really appreciate anyone's insight. Does anyone else struggle with this kind of conflict? What are your views on it?

First I started shaving my legs, then I tried out nail polish (which I totally dig) and then I noticed that I wanted to wear skirts.

This got me thinking about my gender and if I might actually be (binary) trans. I learned about the different gender identities and finally realized that I didn't understand what having a clear gender identity meant. I've always felt way more ""me"" than ""manly"". That's when I discovered that I'm most likely agender.

I've been going commando for at least a year and I really don't like mens underwear because I think it's uncomfortable. However, after making myself a skirt I quickly realized that not wearing underwear beneath a short skirt isn't really going to work (male genitals are super annoying). 

I read that womens panties are super comfortable even for biological males and yesterday my first pack of panties arrived. They are so much more comfortable than boxers and I really like them. I guess that's probably what triggered my dream.

I dreamed that I was a trans woman. I distinctly remember that I felt like a woman. I had a clear gender identity. However, after waking up I can no longer explain or even remember how having a gender identity felt and while being awake I feel the same as before - without gender.

 I've spent my entire life feeling wrong in my body, but being told I was a girl, and figured that was how I was supposed to feel or whatever. When I was 11, I first heard the word transgender. 

When I researched more, I realized how much that sounded like me. I spent the next four years trying to find out exactly who I was. I came out as agender in March, right before I turned 16. I find that the term libramasculine or demiboy fits better than agender alone. I actually thought I was a binary trans guy for a while, but I don't know if that's right either.

Anyway, I'm going by they/them and he/him pronouns. I got called a ""young lady"" by a stranger today, and that bothered me quite a lot more than it probably should have. I didn't correct the person, though, because I'm probably never going to see said person again. 

Sorry the photos suck. My laptop webcam isn't the best, and the bathroom mirror was dirty, but I think you can still kind of see me. What can I do to look more androgynous or masculine, to pass and to help with dysphoria? I wear men's clothes, bind my chest, and got a haircut.

2020-08-11 02:47:22,i7jma0,5,1," Hey everyone! I'm AMAB, 18 years old, and recently I was looking through [r/egg\_irl](https://www.reddit.com/r/egg_irl/), as you do, and started to suspect I might be trans, something there was always an inkling of in my mind. But after more consideration and research, it still doesn't seem quite right. I think I might be agender instead. Here's why:

* I would probably press ""the button"" to turn into a girl, but I'm not sure if I'd want to present feminine at all
* The idea of wearing dresses, skirts, lipstick, etc. makes me feel really wierd and doesn't feel right.
* The idea of shaving my arms and legs also seems wierd
* I'm not sure how I feel about she/her pronouns, they/them feels better for me.
* I have almost no dysphoria, the only things that make me feel wierd are my very deep voice when I hear it in a recording, and my facial hair which I shave.
* I have no bottom dysphoria, no top dysphoria (I don't like my chest but that's cause I'm kinda overweight, in fact I don't like having ""man boobs"" lmao)
* I don't really feel like a man, but I also don't feel like a woman trapped in a man's body either. I don't feel like either, I just feel like I'm \*me\*
* I feel like I have more of a desire to \*not\* be masculine than to be explicitly feminine

Overall I would prefer to be AFAB than AMAB, but I think even if I was AFAB I would still not want to appear feminine, not want to wear dresses skirts etc, and feel equally wierd about being feminine as being masculine. Ultimately being MTF kinda makes sense but it doesn't feel right. Agender feels like it fits a bit better.

&amp;#x200B;

   First time posting here. I’m so sorry if this sort of thing isn’t allowed for some reason. Just let me know and I’ll correct whatever needs to be corrected :)

I’m a 24 year old afab enby who is about to be, for the first time in my life, in a situation where I don’t have to pretend I’m female. I’ve been repressing how I feel for so long because I’ve never had the money to move out of my mom’s house, but it looks like my luck has changed. In October, I’ll finally be moving out with a trans friend of mine. He’s about two years older than me, and neither of us has ever been out of our parents’ houses, so it’s pretty exciting.   
My big issues revolve around my very typically female body. My hips are super wide and I wear a d-cup bra. I’ve done a lot of research on what binder to use, but it seems like every time I find one that seems like it’ll be good, I find a picture of someone wearing one where their chest is still pretty obvious. I know I’ll never get a flat look with a binder, but I want something more than what a sports bra can give me.   
Anywho, does anyone have binder advice for someone with a larger chest? Preferably something under $50, as I am poor, but I might save up a little extra for a really nice, more expensive one if they work better for larger chests.",NonBinary,Binder advice?,1597142062.0,"{'created_utc': 1597116862, 'id': 'i7kc1j', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Hey!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   First time posting here.

2020-08-11 06:30:41,i7mowp,3,1,"I’m a bio female, but I have always had a fascination with presenting masculine. In middle school, I started cross-dressing regularly. I treated it like a joke (I’m sorry, that was insensitive in hindsight, but I was young and trying to dodge the bullies by laughing with them) but I went the whole nine yards: mascara moustache, bow tie (I’ve always loved bow ties), even a masculine name. At the time I didn’t know anything except that it made me happy to like, take a break from being a girl.

In high school, I took every excuse to cross-dress but I stopped doing it when I had no excuse. I refined it into a “drag persona” with the help of a friend. (I never actually got to preform. I was going to do my city’s amateur drag competition this year for pride, but the pandemic hit). I jokingly started referring to my dress-like-a-man impulse as the “drag instinct.” I also developed my day-to-day fashion sense to be far more masculine. (Think button-ups with vests and nice men’s shoes sort of thing) I also came out as an ace lesbian. At that point, I just wrote the whole thing off as me being butch, and I think those around me did too.

At this point, I’ve got an internal debate:

Case for me being non-binary:
I don’t particularly resonate with the idea of womanhood. I’ve always had a neutral view of my presumed gender, and I’ve never considered it important to my perception of myself. I have plenty of distinctly masculine traits and mannerisms mixed in with my more feminine ones. I have always wanted to make people around me recognize my masculinity at least as much as my femininity. I even appreciate when people think I’m a dude or aren’t sure. It feels like a success, in a way.

Case for me just being an over-thinker:
Butch lesbians are a thing. I might just be one of those. It’s possible that the alienation I feel from the idea of womanhood is just caused by the female stereotypes that I don’t fit. I am uncomfortable (as an asexual) with the hyper-sexualization of traditional femininity, which may explain my masculine tastes. I do not have body dysphoria. In fact, when dressing casually (so, not actually full-on crossdressing, just normal masculine clothes) I pick clothing fits that compliment my (clearly bio female) body. I do not feel the need to change my pronouns. I don’t care about pronouns, and it would be a lot to explain all the time.


Idk, lads, ladies, sundry folk, entities, cryptids, icons, etc, otherwise, and combinations of the above: how am I “supposed” to feel? Do most people really just know their genders? Is my gender identity “supposed” to be integral to my perception of myself? What are your guys’ experiences, if they compare at all? What does it feel like to know your gender?

Am,, am I non-binary?? If so, what variety of non-binary??? Can anyone answer these questions other than me??? Is it my nap time???

I really like being perceived as male. I use he/him pronouns, and have introduced myself as a trans man without feeling super weird about it. I considered using they/them pronouns, but don't like the idea of people perceiving me as not a guy

However, I don't really,,,,feel like a guy. I don't feel the same attachement to Manhood™️ that other people seem to feel. My attachment is just enough that yes, I use he/him pronouns and plan on going on testosterone and getting top surgery, and for the most part still plan on telling most people im a man. But my connection to manhood feels Very Loose.

I definitely plan on mostly telling people I'm a (trans) man, especially since a lot of my co-workers are cis people. But internally my connection to manhood is very loose.

2020-08-12 03:39:35,i86kga,8,1,"I feel like there is a need for a simple term that refers to all marginalized genders. And though there are many reasons why we shouldn't always lump genderqueer folx, non-binary folx, binary trans folx, and women together, there are some situations where this would be really helpful.

So I present to you... **""MarGen""**. 

Here's my reasoning:

I often see people use ""women and non-binary"" which groups non-binary folx with women. I've seen some people propose using ""Non-Men"", but this excludes trans men and can exclude non-binary / genderqueer folx who identify as men in part. Also, ""non-men"" centers ""men"" as the default category.

Using ""Marginalized Genders"" in it's entirety, IMO, requires you to identify explicitly with the term ""marginalized"" which can be uncomfortable and makes me feel like I'm identifying with being forgotten, unheard, or helpless.

We do need a word that fully encompasses marginalized genders because often this is what is intended when people want to create scholarships, programs, events, etc for this particular group, but they are limited in doing this because of a lack of terminology.

So that's why I wanted to present ""MarGen"", short for ""Marginalized Genders"". LMK what y'all think in the poll or comments!

I’ve never really thought that I could be non-binary, because although I feel some discomfort at the thought of identifying as a woman all the time for the rest of my life, I’ve never really had any body dysphoria. I’m not very curvy, and I could pretty much hide the way my body is shaped. I like being able to present as a man one day, and as a woman the next.

I remember being in school (I go to an all girls school) and not being able to look in the mirror some days because I hated the way I looked and presented (It’s a convent; skirts below the knee and all that jazz) and being in quarantine and not presenting that way has felt really relieving to me. Also, it feels really, really good when somebody mistakes me for a boy, or gets confused about my gender. I’m really dreading going back to school in October because I don’t want to present as fully female.

I’m questioning if I might be non-binary (or genderfluid of some sort) because I don’t think that presenting as a man would relieve *all* of the confusing feelings I have about my gender or the way I present, but I don’t want to be a woman either.

Long story short I’ve seen a couple clips on YouTube trying to explain so I feel I have a little grasp but I thought I’d ask in a community where people are either discovering them self or already identify them self as non binary.

My understanding is that you don’t identify as a particular gender.

Would I’d be correct to say your inbetween male and female genders but with no transitioning to be one over the other ?  

Is it some days you feel more male than female and then other days it’s the opposite?

Or is it more each day you just feel inbetween?

Also another question I have is:

If you were born and classed as a female say, but you felt more masculine, this isn’t non binary, that would be more masculine female?

As I say just trying to educate myself so I do apologise if any of the terminology is incorrect or causes offence

TL;DR tried to come out to my partner and he was aggressive and doesn’t think being non binary is legitimate. Has anyone been in a similar situation/have advice for how to explain to someone who doesn’t get it? 

I’ve been in a hereto relationship for 5 years, and although I realized I’m non-binary and pan a couple of years ago I haven’t told anyone for fear of being dismissed or not taken seriously. I recently decided I had to tell those closest to me because I wasn’t being honest about who I was. I told my best friend, who was super supportive and didn’t question it at all. My partner has a lot of queer friends and his bandmate recently came out as a trans woman, he’s very accepting of her and I’ve never heard him be intolerant, so I didn’t think he would be weird about it at all. 
I told him last night, and his initial reaction was “oh you’re jumping on that bandwagon”. Obviously that made me feel horrible and I instantly regretted saying anything. He then asked me to explain what it means to me, that I don’t feel like either female or male and just prefer they/them pronouns, and that it’s kind of hard for me to articulate right now because his initial reaction triggered my anxiety. He started to raise his voice and said “I don’t fit the societal norms of being a male but that doesn’t mean I’m non binary” and “so many people just fake that to be victims or be ‘trendy’”. I kept trying to explain myself but he was raising his voice and cutting me off and my anxiety made me shut down and start crying. He started yelling at me to explain it to him and stop crying and saying I’m too sensitive. It escalated into an argument and I was trying to say to just be calm and I’m happy to talk about it but I can’t talk to you like this and he kept saying I’m being too sensitive (I’m full blown bawling at this point). He then started to question whether I’m attracted to him and just saying he doesn’t understand etc, and saying “do you like women or guys??” “If nothing changes then why even say anything” I walked away from him because I couldn’t take it and couldn’t keep going in circles explaining how he was being aggressive and it’s not helping me. Later he apologized for what he initially said but blamed me for blowing it out of proportion and being dramatic. I was still crying my eyes out and trying to explain to him how I feel and he wouldn’t let me get a word in. He left the room and said he was going to go watch tv to give me space and ended up sleeping on the couch. I was up until 8am this morning crying and wishing I never brought it up.

2020-08-13 22:29:38,i99tnf,3,1,"Hi, I'm very new to this so I hope that I'm doing this right.

Recently I've started questioning my gender which is honestly something that I never thought I would do. I heavily struggled with my sexuality from a very young age and I sometimes still do but to a much lesser extent. Up until a year or two ago, I'd always felt very sure and solid about identifying as cis. But because I've become more informed and educated about gender, (I was pretty clueless before, oops) plus the fact that quarantine caused me to have (way too much) time to self reflect, it made me realize that I don't feel exactly comfortable just using she/her pronouns and that I don't really feel comfortable identifying completely as female. (I'm AFAB btw, sorry I didn't mention that earlier) I'm fairly sure that if I was to label my gender I would be a demigirl and use she/they pronouns.

All of my ongoing confusion aside... I was wondering if the wonderful people on this subreddit could recommend ways to dress at least more androgynous. I say androgynous because I'm absolutely terrified of coming out to anyone as anything other than cis because I have some friends and family who wouldn't be exactly the most accepting and understanding bunch. (Also I'm still afraid that my brain is just making all of this up for attention, something that I struggled with a lot when it came to my sexuality too) My friends and family already know that I identify as pan so dressing more androgynously shouldn't really set off any alarms for them and they will probably just think of it as a fashion statement. Apparently, sexuality is easier for them to accept than gender, something that I learned when I started dating my boyfriend who my parents knew before he transitioned. I've also needed a wardrobe update for a while and my newest clothes are hand-me-downs from my boyfriend when he started transitioning and needed to get rid of some of his old clothes. Most of them were button-downs and I know that I really enjoy those. Also if any of you know where to get a good decently priced hoodie, I've been searching for what seems like ages but the costs most of the time are astronomical. Sorry, I'm basically rambling at this point.

(Also I'm still afraid that my brain is just making all of this up for attention, something that I struggled with a lot when it came to my sexuality too) My friends and family already know that I identify as pan so dressing more androgynously shouldn't really set off any alarms for them and they will probably just think of it as a fashion statement. Apparently, sexuality is easier for them to accept than gender, something that I learned when I started dating my boyfriend who my parents knew before he transitioned. I've also needed a wardrobe update for a while and my newest clothes are hand-me-downs from my boyfriend when he started transitioning and needed to get rid of some of his old clothes. Most of them were button-downs and I know that I really enjoy those. Also if any of you know where to get a good decently priced hoodie, I've been searching for what seems like ages but the costs most of the time are astronomical. Sorry, I'm basically rambling at this point.\n\nThank you, and much love &lt;3"", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Suggestions for dressing more androgynous/masc', 'created': 1597382978.0}"

2020-08-14 20:47:31,i9tz69,2,1,"Just curious if anyone has positive experiences with college Greek life.  Did anyone here join a Greek organization while openly non-binary?  I know the Greek  stereotypes aren’t positive but there are plenty of chapters out there that don’t fit toxic mold.  I’m also curious because membership is so based around very gendered ideas of brotherhood/sisterhood.

I went to an exclusively engineering school (very nerdy) where over half the campus was Greek.  I wasn’t out or self aware at the time and I joined a fraternity.  It was a very good experience and I probably wouldn’t have graduated without the support of my brothers.

These things, I know, are just part of being a kid not necessarily indicative of gender but I'm just trying to provide a background. Most of my friends were girls up until about age 10 and since then my friend groups have been mixed.

I started questioning my gender a couple of years ago, although I never really thought I was trans, I just thought I definitely would rather have been born a guy. Mostly these days I wear jeans and shorts and men's t-shirts and men's joggers and men's hoodies and men's boxers and......you get the picture. Basically I like to dress like a man and I 100% completely hate dressing like ""a girl"" or ""a woman"". Not sure if I'm just gender non-conforming which is what I have thought for a while now but I have just ordered a binder online which I've been working myself up to for months now and that the fact that I've finally done it makes me feel pretty happy about myself.

When I play video games if I get the choice I always always always choose a male character which I actually thought was totally normal until recently when I realised most people choose a character with the same biological sex as them.

I only get dysphoria sometimes with my tits. If I could choose, then I'd wish them away, but usually the days go by and live with them fine. Bottom dysphoria isn't a thing for me but ever since I was a young teenager I sometimes put things in my pants to see what it's like to have a dick, and I quite enjoy just sitting there feeling like I have one. All my girl friends I've spoken to haven't really done this but I don't know if anyone else has? However, like I said, I do not get actual bottom dysphoria, and I'm very aware that many people say you have to be dysphoric to to be trans.

In terms of pronouns it doesn't really bother me. I'm used to she/her but in online games when people call me he/him I quite like it, and if someone used they/them I don't think it would bother me.

i am a transmasc person who is four months on testosterone. I'm really happy, every little change that happens in my body from the T is making me feel more and more at home in my body and more comfortable with being in public. The hair growth, the deepening of my voice, the broadening of my shoulders, every bit of masculinity that gets added to me makes me feel better. 

However, right now, I have this really nice ambiguity about me where people cannot tell from looking at me whether I'm trans, cis, male, or female. While I want to be predominantly male in my physiology (i intend on getting top and bottom surgery), I don't ever want to lose this sense of ambiguity completely- I want to exude femme energy with a masculine body and keep people guessing as to what I am, largely because that's the closest I can get to escaping being gendered completely. 

Basically, I want to be able to pass as male at the grocery store/bank/in my day-to-day life (mostly because I do not feel safe being read/known as non-binary in general society), but in social spaces and queer spaces, I don't want people to be able to definitively tell what gender I am. I want to be a perfect balance of femininity and masculinity which prevents people from knowing what I am.

I've recently had a number of bad days filled with dysphoria and depression, hating my bodyshape (not so much the weight, more the exaggerated curves that come with the weight) and somehow this resulted in me signing up for gym classes. They're the first in-person classes allowed since 'rona hit, I even got up earlier to make sure I'd get in when the registration period started. I felt good about that, it's two weekly sessions of 1h each, for a total of 10 weeks, starting on Monday. So far so good.. 

Now I realised what I've done though..
There will be locker rooms! I'll need to change, maybe even shower. There will be other people, not only in the gym but also in the locker room! I'll probably have to walk into the women's locker room twice a week, no way around it.
I don't even own gym shoes, shorts or suitable shirts and will thus have to buy all of these before Monday evening. Clothes shopping is the worst for me, never a euphoric moment. Cant even order stuff online because it will not arrive in time, I'll have to physically walk into a sports shop (never fun as an overweight person in general) and spend half a day trying on ill-fitting, too small, tight, annoying things.
I might have to get a sports bra, that's going to be interesting, too.

I'll need to change, maybe even shower. There will be other people, not only in the gym but also in the locker room! I'll probably have to walk into the women's locker room twice a week, no way around it.\nI don't even own gym shoes, shorts or suitable shirts and will thus have to buy all of these before Monday evening. Clothes shopping is the worst for me, never a euphoric moment. Cant even order stuff online because it will not arrive in time, I'll have to physically walk into a sports shop (never fun as an overweight person in general) and spend half a day trying on ill-fitting, too small, tight, annoying things.\nI might have to get a sports bra, that's going to be interesting, too. \n\nWhat do I do?

I'm an amab NB person who usually presents pretty masculine and uses He/They pronouns. I don't consider myself a man

The thing that I've been mulling over for a while (mostly just as a thought experiment/language analysis) is this:

If a heterosexual woman or homosexual man find themselves attracted to me yet still feel exactly heterosexual or homosexual where does that fit into the human experience?

Because I cannot invalidate their sexuality or tell them what they are, that is something only they can decide.

But on the other hand, their characterization of their attraction to me is as, for the purposes of this thought experiment, a ""man/masculine being"". 

This creates a conflict of validation and identity that I think is very interesting and I was wondering what y'all think of it and if you've had similar experiences or opinions you'd like to share.

2020-08-17 18:35:09,ibjy1t,6,1," Hi, everyone! My name is Aspen. I'm in my late twenties and identify as genderqueer. I go by they/them pronouns, and I've recently decided to start going by Aspen instead of my birth name. I've told most people, but not yet my parents. They know about my gender and are supportive and curious without overstepping, but they don't know that I've named myself, yet. 

I want to be considerate of them, though, especially my mom. A relative in the extended family just died about a week ago, and it fell to my parents to sort out her affairs. My mom was fairly close with the relative who died, though they hadn't lived near each other for a long while. Dad wasn't close with her to my knowledge, nor was I. But if I tell one of them about my name, I'm telling both of them, lol. I fully understand this. And I've held off for several days now from telling them, because while I fully believe it is a good thing I know it's also a BIG thing. I was going to tell my mom the morning she informed me of the relative's death. After hearing that sad news, it didn't feel right telling her that day, but now that a few days have passed... I feel like it would probably be alright to gauge her mood today (or soonish) and ask her if she would be open to a deep conversation or whether it should wait. On the one hand I feel like I've respected the dead and must also respect myself. On the other I doubt myself and wonder whether I should keep it to myself longer to be polite. I'm so tired of swallowing my truth to make other people more comfortable, though. I want to be considerate, not invisible.

I know my parents love me no matter what, but what's your experience telling your family your name is changing? What pitfalls might they run into that I can anticipate and help them through and past? I understand I've had a head start so to speak to get used to the newness. So I'll be patient if they have trouble understanding why I feel like my birth name no longer fits me. But I have a good metaphor to use. My old name is like an old, favorite dress that I have outgrown. It doesn't mean I hate it -- it just doesn't fit right on me, so I don't want to wear it anymore. I want to wear something that fits me as I am now and reflects my current sense of identity. I still have a lot of fondness for my birth name but it's like... looking at something you wore when you were seven, as an adult. You probably remember wearing it, but how awkward and uncomfortable would you feel if you had to wear it now? So much has changed since then. It's a part of my past, but it makes me dysphoric to use such an overtly feminine name. Names have a lot of baggage and connotations and implications that I don't want to fend off every time I introduce myself. 

*sigh*. I just love my parents a lot and don't want to upset them... I want them to be as happy as I am about finding my name! I know we can't choose how other people react, but even if Aspen is not my forever name, it gets me closer to where I want to be and that brings me *so* much joy. But realistically, I know probably no one is going to be as excited as I am. What do you think, should I hold off out of respect for my family, or be assertive and tell them my truth? 

I feel like it's possible to both be respectful of them by asking their comfort with a deep discussion and at the same time assert myself with pride by telling them how much happiness the new name brings me. 

*Aspen*. It's like I have a small, bright pearl within my heart, and every time I hear the name I've chosen used for me, another thin layer of nacre is deposited onto the surface of that pearl... And so, larger and more lustrous does the pearl grow. My identity is a treasure that has long been hidden and repressed out of fear, but now that it's safe for me to be who I really am, I'm so impatient to keep figuring out who that is and ease the discomfort I now know is gender dysphoria. I hope it doesn't throw my parents for too much of a loop, is all. My mom and I are especially close and always have been. I don't want either of my parents to feel as though I am rejecting them in any way by retiring my birth name. 

Also, I really want to hear my mom use my name and have her give me a hug. It's been too long since we've been able to see each other. :( It's been since the winter holidays of 2018 since we've seen each other! Really need a hug from my dad, too...

2020-08-17 19:49:05,iblex5,4,1,"I’m an AFAB non-binary person who experiences a great deal of social dysphoria. I hate being seen as female &amp; hate being treated as female. And ever since I started dating my partner (who is a cis bi man), I feel even more dysphoria because now I’m viewed as a cis heterosexual woman which makes me gag even more. My identity and desire has always felt queer so this is like double erasure.

Some of the things I’ve done over the years to alleviate this discomfort is to change my name, use they/them pronouns, cut my hair &amp; experiment with more androgynous/masculine clothing styles. While this has definitely helped, the problem I’m now facing is feeling like I can no longer explore the feminine side of me because of this senseless thought that being “feminine” means I’m no longer “convincingly” non-binary. I KNOW that there is no one way to look non-binary and you don’t have to appear androgynous to be valid. But it’s still something that I struggle with a great deal. Mostly because whenever I dress more masculine, a part of me just feels like I’m tomboy cis woman (and ppl treat me that way) and then I start to feel dysphoric again. Simultaneously, I also feel dysphoric when I dress feminine and wear makeup because society definitely does not see me as non-binary unless I tell them (even then I feel like they just perceive me as girl-lite ugh).

Does anyone relate to this? I’ve been tossing around the idea of going on T because I don’t know how much I can take this discomfort anymore.

I don't know if it's because the lockdown has me self-reflecting more (I also recently realised and came out as bi) but I (21F) just feel like something isn't quite right?
I've always been seen as a tomboy (I also used to cross dress as a teen but stopped) I'm more like my brothers than my sisters. I have cut my hair super short quite a few times, and tend to dress quite masculine, I feel the most comfortable like this. 
Whenever I create a character in a game/story, it's always a man (I literally have zero characters that are women). And whenever I daydream the main character is always male. I'd say this ""main character"" in my fantasies/daydreams feels like what I'd like to be (I can't say for certain that I feel this way 100% of the time, just quite often) 
I used to say that ""If I had been born a man I-"" and stuff like ""I would have made a good looking guy"" but I dunno if that actually means anything... 

It's not like I hate being a woman, but I don't necessarily feel great about it either. I'd say I'm almost apathetic towards it. If there were a pill I could take to become a guy, I know I would do it in a heartbeat. 
The thing is I feel like I'm too old to realise this about myself, I've heard so many people say they knew from a young age so I feel dumb for even considering it now. I'm worried that maybe that I'm imagining it. I don't get deeply uncomfortable about having breasts or a vagina, but as I said I'm not thrilled about them either. It just doesn't feel like I have dysphoria like I've seen people describe. I just feel kinda.... Dull about them (probably not the right way to describe it) 

I also like to add that although I like masculine things, I also like makeup and occasionally dresses, but then I know there are plenty of guys who like these things too....

I'm going for a psych major so naturally I'm taking a psych class.
All the assignments were unlocked today and im looking everything over and notice that gender is apart of my first writing prompt/essay 😂

One of the areas I need to hit on is how my gender influences life experiences and how it would be different if I were the opposite gender. But I identify as non binary.

Initially I was saying to myself that I wanted to do it to normalize gender neutral language, but I kind of thought a lot about it last night and I think I am at least a little uncomfortable with being called the words women/lady/girl.

2020-08-18 20:14:33,ic8r6e,10,1,"I don’t have anywhere else to put this, despite the fact I’m likely to get in trouble I did something at work that has made my year.

For context I’m not nonbinary, I’m a pride ally but my own journey got me back to where I started. A straight male. Also, I have Aspergers.

I work in banking on a till, I’m the dick head that comes at you with an tablet and asks you what you want to do today. 

A long time ago now a nonbinary customer came in with a deedpoll and changed their name. They politely asked if we could change their title to MX as part of the process. This sadly wasn’t an option and we settled on the best fit we had as not having one isn’t an option apparently.

I promised I’d look into it and that I would get in touch if it ever became an option. I’ve had that same note in two diaries and it had been a priority ever since. At every opportunity I queried and challenged it. Naturally excuse followed excuse. Then one day a change was made and it was possible. I got in touch...

2020-08-19 08:24:23,icjqtx,2,1,"Hey! 

A month ago I posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/hsor0y/about_to_start_testosterone_and_finasteride/) asking for some advice and sharing my concerns about starting T and Finasteride as a DIYer. I'm back a month later to update anyone who might be interested in my experience. I technically started just *under* a month ago but I won't have access to the internet on the exact date, so I'm just going to post today. 

To recap, my main concern with T was bottom growth. I was very nervous about the prospect of any changes happening with my genitals for trauma reasons, hence my interest in Fin as something that reportedly prevents bottom growth. It also prevents hair loss which is an added bonus. Unfortunately, Fin also prevents other changes like facial hair growth and there is some conflicting evidence to suggest it may prevent voice drops. 

I would like facial hair. I would like voice drops. As a result, I decided to take a micro-dose of Fin. I have been halving 1mg pills and taking half a pill just before I apply 25mg of Testogel. I am considering upping that dose but I'll get on to my reasons for that later. I'm just going to go through any physical and psychological changes I experienced this month. I keep a journal so I'll bullet point the main themes. 

**Week One**

* The evening of my first dose I felt incredibly euphoric. Obviously, nothing had changed but I felt like I was making progress which brought me a lot of happiness.
* With that said, I did struggle with anxiety when applying gel and for several hours after applying gel. I think this is due to my concerns around self medicating. Around day four, I had a very intense panic attack which is not something I've experienced for a long time. 
* I felt an ache in my shoulders after applying gel that increased my anxiety but it seems to be normal based on anecdotal accounts. This ache has happened every time I've applied gel but goes away after a short amount of time.
* Three days in, I struggled with a  significant dip in mood and dysphoria in general felt impossible to manage. This eased as the week went on but that day was particularly difficult. 
* For the first few days after application I felt increased sensation around my genitals. It was not a painful sensation but I was simply more aware of my genitals due to this increased sensation. I did not experience bottom growth - I compared pictures from the beginning of the week to the end of the week and did not notice any growth. 
* Around day four, I felt like something was different with my chest. The tissue felt less firm and I felt much more dysphoric and distressed about my chest. Spending time shirtless after applying gel may be making me more aware of my chest but I did feel like the breast tissue was notably softer.
* My skin broke out pretty quickly despite me maintaining a skincare routine. 
* Day Seven, I woke up with a very noticeable sore throat. I didn't develop a cough or any other symptoms of illness. It was just a very scratchy throat. 

**Week Two**

* My anxiety around self medicating began to ease up and I started to feel more confident in my ability to manage my own health. I did experience another panic attack mid-week but in general my anxiety felt reduced. 
* Shortly before my panic attack, I had a very significant dip in mood mid-week. I felt incredibly depressed and dysphoric and spent a lot of time thinking about whether I would get the changes I wanted whilst still taking Fin. I stopped doing so much online research and this helped to improve my mood. My mood improved further throughout the week. 
* Generally, my interest in sex very moderately increased. (Should note that I am on the asexual spectrum so YMMV!)
* No bottom growth. Again, increased sensation in the genital area, and that area did seem to be firmer at times (possibly due to increased physical arousal) but visually I could see no changes.
* Softening tissue around the chest seemed to be less of an issue. The chest seemed firmer but slightly smaller. This is purely anecdotal and I didn't take measurements as I prefer not to think about the chest. This is based on touch whilst washing and visual observation when applying gel.
* Spots really showed up. I got spots in areas I've never had them before. I got them on my temple, jaw, shoulders, and back. My cis brother had acne during puberty and that is a concern but honestly it's manageable with a decent skin care routine. 
* Increased temperature and sweating more often. Easily managed with regular showers and deodorant. 
* Around day six this week I woke up with a random hair on my jaw. Pre-T I've had very fine light hair on my chin but this was thick like an eyebrow hair and in a new location. I plucked it because as a single hair it looked ridiculous but I found it interesting and encouraging to think about what that *might* mean for micro-dosing. 
* Something happened with my voice. My throat continued to hurt throughout the week like a scratching sensation. I also felt that the quality was changing slightly. Resonance is the same - I still sound like a female and no one else would notice this shift in quality. A pitch app I use said my pitch had dropped since starting T but it is still in the female range. Inching towards androgynous. 
* When looking in the mirror my face looked subtly different. I couldn't put my finger on what had changed but it felt like the lower half was a little thinner and the upper half seemed rounder which was weird but pleasant. 

**Week Three**

* Anxiety massively reduced as I got into the swing of things. I felt much happier in general and whilst I had the occasional difficult moment with dysphoria I was generally in a better state of mind. Only one instance of increased anxiety. 
* No noticeable bottom growth. Increased sensation continued. I compared a picture from pre-T with day two of this week and I did have to look twice as I wasn't sure whether there had been some very very subtle bottom growth. I came to the conclusion that there *probably* hadn't been and if there had it was microscopic. I generally feel fine about that and the prospect of bottom growth is feeling less and less uncomfortable to me. 
* My skin took a turn for the worst with dry patches and texture in places. There was a mixture of angry looking red spots and general skin coloured bumps. Skin care continues. Small spots on my shoulders where I apply gel don't seem to go away.
* I noticed that I'd been getting an aching sensation in my abdomen. It isn't painful but it is uncomfortable. It feels like burning but cold in temperature. 
* My throat still felt raw on and off throughout the week. I stopped checking with pitch app and recording as I started to feel a little depressed about the possibility that I was just reaching for a change that wasn't necessarily noticeable. 
* I noticed that the hair on my arms had spread a little. I've always had light hair on my wrists but the hair has crept a few inches past my wrist onto the back of my hand. It's very fine light hair but it is something new. 
* Energy levels are much lower this week. I feel like sleeping more often. I've slept later than I usually would. My sleep quality is poorer. 

That brings us on to Week Four which I'm only about half way through. Breakouts continue to be a major issue. My skin looks like shit. My throat is aching a little bit less but I really notice the scratching sensation after talking for extended periods. I do feel it is easier to reach a lower pitch if I'm trying but I don't think I've had a voice drop. Still no bottom growth that I can detect. I feel that my arms are much more muscular in the last week. I also think my leg hair is thicker. Abdominal aching/cool burning is still present. 

My brother visited me for the first time in a long time and he said I look taller. I am absolutely not claiming I've gained height - I'm in my early twenties as my growth plates are closed. I have, however, noticed that my posture is better. Generally, I feel a little more confident, so I think I'm standing straighter and trying to hide away a little less. That's a subconscious thing - I only realised when he made that comment. 

Two days ago, I did start menstruating. I have generally felt fine but I believe it is heavier than usual and I have had a different sort of cramping sensation. It is not a familiar cramping. It is manageable pain but distinctly unusual. 

I have spent a lot of time this month thinking about the things that make me dysphoric and the things I would really like to change. My voice is top of the list shortly followed by my chest. I think I've been hyper-focused on my voice with the scratching sensation and it's made me realise I really want to see that change. I'm looking into therapy to resolve my genital based trauma as I would like to come off Fin at some stage. 

I am also considering increasing my T dose from 25mg to 50mg. I feel like 25mg is a good starter dose but it's just been something on my mind this month. We'll see what happens. 

That's about all for my monthly round-up. I thought I'd come here to update because when I was researching T and Fin I found the personal anecdotes the most helpful. There weren't very many resources available for NB people looking to start T and Fin at the same time. Whilst it's only anecdotal I thought it might be helpful for someone so I'm happy to stop in and update every so often if it helps a few people with research.",NonBinary,One Month on Testosterone and Finasteride - Transmasc NB Transition,1597850663.0,"{'created_utc': 1597825463, 'id': 'icjqtx', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""Hey! \n\nA month ago I posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/hsor0y/about_to_start_testosterone_and_finasteride/) asking for some advice and sharing my concerns about starting T and Finasteride as a DIYer.

Pre-T I've had very fine light hair on my chin but this was thick like an eyebrow hair and in a new location. I plucked it because as a single hair it looked ridiculous but I found it interesting and encouraging to think about what that *might* mean for micro-dosing. \n* Something happened with my voice. My throat continued to hurt throughout the week like a scratching sensation. I also felt that the quality was changing slightly. Resonance is the same - I still sound like a female and no one else would notice this shift in quality. A pitch app I use said my pitch had dropped since starting T but it is still in the female range. Inching towards androgynous. \n* When looking in the mirror my face looked subtly different. I couldn't put my finger on what had changed but it felt like the lower half was a little thinner and the upper half seemed rounder which was weird but pleasant. \n\n**Week Three**\n\n* Anxiety massively reduced as I got into the swing of things. I felt much happier in general and whilst I had the occasional difficult moment with dysphoria I was generally in a better state of mind. Only one instance of increased anxiety. \n* No noticeable bottom growth. Increased sensation continued. I compared a picture from pre-T with day two of this week and I did have to look twice as I wasn't sure whether there had been some very very subtle bottom growth. I came to the conclusion that there *probably* hadn't been and if there had it was microscopic. I generally feel fine about that and the prospect of bottom growth is feeling less and less uncomfortable to me. \n* My skin took a turn for the worst with dry patches and texture in places. There was a mixture of angry looking red spots and general skin coloured bumps. Skin care continues. Small spots on my shoulders where I apply gel don't seem to go away.\n* I noticed that I'd been getting an aching sensation in my abdomen. It isn't painful but it is uncomfortable. It feels like burning but cold in temperature. \n* My throat still felt raw on and off throughout the week. I stopped checking with pitch app and recording as I started to feel a little depressed about the possibility that I was just reaching for a change that wasn't necessarily noticeable. \n* I noticed that the hair on my arms had spread a little. I've always had light hair on my wrists but the hair has crept a few inches past my wrist onto the back of my hand. It's very fine light hair but it is something new. \n* Energy levels are much lower this week. I feel like sleeping more often. I've slept later than I usually would. My sleep quality is poorer. \n\nThat brings us on to Week Four which I'm only about half way through. Breakouts continue to be a major issue. My skin looks like shit. My throat is aching a little bit less but I really notice the scratching sensation after talking for extended periods. I do feel it is easier to reach a lower pitch if I'm trying but I don't think I've had a voice drop. Still no bottom growth that I can detect. I feel that my arms are much more muscular in the last week. I also think my leg hair is thicker. Abdominal aching/cool burning is still present. \n\nMy brother visited me for the first time in a long time and he said I look taller. I am absolutely not claiming I've gained height - I'm in my early twenties as my growth plates are closed. I have, however, noticed that my posture is better. Generally, I feel a little more confident, so I think I'm standing straighter and trying to hide away a little less. That's a subconscious thing - I only realised when he made that comment. \n\nTwo days ago, I did start menstruating. I have generally felt fine but I believe it is heavier than usual and I have had a different sort of cramping sensation. It is not a familiar cramping. It is manageable pain but distinctly unusual. \n\nI have spent a lot of time this month thinking about the things that make me dysphoric and the things I would really like to change. My voice is top of the list shortly followed by my chest. I think I've been hyper-focused on my voice with the scratching sensation and it's made me realise I really want to see that change. I'm looking into therapy to resolve my genital based trauma as I would like to come off Fin at some stage. \n\nI am also considering increasing my T dose from 25mg to 50mg. I feel like 25mg is a good starter dose but it's just been something on my mind this month. We'll see what happens. \n\nThat's about all for my monthly round-up. I thought I'd come here to update because when I was researching T and Fin I found the personal anecdotes the most helpful. There weren't very many resources available for NB people looking to start T and Fin at the same time. Whilst it's only anecdotal I thought it might be helpful for someone so I'm happy to stop in and update every so often if it helps a few people with research."", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'One Month on Testosterone and Finasteride - Transmasc NB Transition', 'created': 1597850663.0}"

But while I've been thinking, I've been noticing some times that I didn't quite feel like I was exactly female.

I've always enjoyed shopping in the men's section for shirts because they fit nicer- i dont like tight shirts/being in public with a visible chest. Before my chest developed I wore singlets everywhere, but since i was around 13 ive preferred baggy shirts, and they're always easier to find in the mens section. 
When I go for a walk outside, i always find myself pulling my shirt away from my chest, especially when I'm walking into the wind. I just get this feeling that it's super obvious and I just don't like the fact that it's there for other people to see, and I feel very uncomfortable with it. I dont consciously pull at my shirt, but i have noticed that i do it a lot. When im at home im absolutely fine with my chest and couldn't care less about it. I know this doesn't mean i dont identify as female, but it's just another thing to add to the ""questioning"" mix i guess.

I started questioning when we went around in a uni tutorial and introduced ourselves with our names and pronouns (my tutor identifies as them/they which was cool to hear!!). As we were going around the Zoom circle i began getting anxious about saying she/her, and wondering what it even means to have she/her pronouns and whether i really identify as female and my head was just filled with thoughts about gender. 

I haven't mentioned it to my partner- a few months ago i was questioning whether i was asexual and mentioned it to him. He was supportive and gave me room to think, and mentioned that he also thought he may have been asexual when he was 19/20. 
It hasn't been mentioned since (i think he doesn't want to make me feel uncomfortable), but im still questioning who im sexually attracted to, if im sexually  attracted at all and what sexual attraction really means. I know he won't shut me down or shame me if I tell him I'm questioning my gender, but it was such a big, scary thing mentioning asexuality, and there's so much going on in my brain now that I'd find it difficult to express in words what I'm thinking to him. 

I think I'm also worried mentioning it to close friends, because my anxiety tells me that I'll never truly know, and that I'll be here forever wondering and feeling like I've lied to people.

Hi guys, I'm Anzy. First time here, don't know it's allowed, let me know.
I'm going through a lot of thoughts for a long while, many years, even before I knew that non binary identities existed and I don't have anyone to talk about it.

So, here's the thing: I've been told I'm female, which is fine, and I guess I always identified as female my whole life. I never thought I was trans, but as I got older (talking as soon as puberty started basically) I never really felt that much connection with being -just- female. I never knew how to explain to myself, it was always like ""Yes, I'm a woman. But... also, not really?"" So, since I didn't know how to say this to myself I never told anyone else either. I thought I was just a little bit of people called me as a kid, ""Tomboy"" and ""dyke""...
Fast foward a few years, I got to learn about Trans people, Non Binary identities, other sexualities I've never heard about, and the lack of them. I got to grow into a moment where I could search anything and had access to pop culture, so it made it very easy to accept to myself my bisexuality (which by the way I've been so sure of for so long and now I'm not so sure about anything really), besides having a religious family that is not THAT much accepting. Having that access helped me with being very much open to others, and even thought I had my questions I just never really got into it cuz I had a lot of stuff going on in my life, and it's not like I was extremely uncomfortable identifying as female that I had to do something right away about this thoughts. I was fine. I was just kind of a ""tomboy dyke"", right? And it's not like I present myself in an androgynous way, I'm just not your girly pink blob of femininity, but I just had these words and many others being said to me before I even knew what they meant. Maybe they where right. Right?

For the past, maybe year and a half, maybe more, I had these thoughts back on focus. And I didn't expect that at all.
I don't really have friends that I could talk about it (my two friends are far away from me and one of them is an Ancap Straight Guy and the other is a Lesbian who doesn't believe pansexuality exists, so it's not like I know they would be cool to talk about it). And I'm scared to say to anyone I know and thet think it's because it's ""trendy"", and even I was scared to know if that was the reason, but I remembered I have been questioning myself forever.

I guess all I'm asking is the question maybe none of you would be able to respond: How do I know if I'm Non Binary, though? 
What I see in the mirror, what I think I look like in my head, and how I wish looked are SO different from each other that makes me even more confused.

If someone asked me ""How do I know I'm bisexual?"", I would've respond something like ""You just know."" or ""If you're wondering maybe you already have the answer."" But now that I'm in this situation, I don't know if these answers would be good enough. Should I just take the questioning as a yes? 

I know this is a bit long and probably no one will read it, but I really don't have anyone to make questions, talk about it and ask for help.
I would really appreciate if anyone responded me, even if you're not able to help.

2020-08-20 00:26:41,iczzlc,6,1,"Hello fellow humans,

This post is not intended to hurt anybody.

So, I've been reading about sex and gender and that's what I understand at this point:

Gender is more of a cultural-societal/semi-stereotypal term that is related to perceived roles (gender roles), interests, physical appearance etc.

E.g the gender ""male"" is associated with certain interests, clothes, appearance.

I've also read about gender dysphoria disorder in the DSM-5, and how some natal females resist identifying as boys, engage in boyish activities, may experience body dysphoria, and the opposite applies to males (in that context), that being transgender (or transsexual depending on the whole complex stuff behind it).

Afaik the term agender belongs to the non-binary category, and means lack of affiliation to any gender. So, I assume that agender individuals do not want to be called boys nor girls nor are interested in gender roles or being more boyish or girlish. 

Surely genderfluid means that an individual ""fluctates"" between the two genders (and perhaps the agender identity), and pangender means identifying as both at the same time, and we have all sorts of other combinations involving one or two or none genders.

So for the most part, isn't it like sexual orientation, in the sense of how the spectrum is built? (attracted to the opposite sex, same sex, to both, to non, more to one than to the other, any combination of those)

Did I get it right?

As the title suggests, I’ve been having doubts about being non-binary. I’ve been questioning my gender identity for about 3 years.

I’m out to friends and I’m using they/them pronouns and it feels really great except for these doubts I’ve been having recently. I’ve been thinking if not for quarantine would I have ever questioned my gender identity at all and just identified as my birth gender all of my life. Until the start of quarantine I was using she/her pronouns and identified mostly as female and I don’t know if certain events hadn’t of happened that I would identify as non-binary now and that thought makes me feel really fake and quite scared that I have been faking it. Being misgendered now feels really terrible and I don’t like my chest. Not liking my chest also makes me wonder if it’s genuine dysphoria or just feeling bad because of puberty and such.

Additionally, as I found out with the pronoun dressing room, it gives the option of using zhe (where shortening ""they"" only gets you ""the"") if you still want to use singular grammer when talking/writing about a person as the subject for audio/visual aesthetic reasons (seeing ""they is..."" made me cringe, and having to change the grammer to fit in a pre-existing piece of literature made me pout).

NB gender identities currently have no meaningful legal recognition in our country and this is our chance to make our voices heard and demand that our politicians recognise the validity of our existence. 

Although the bill specifically refers to our ability to identify our gender on passports, this marks an important step in the overall legal recognition of non-binary gender identities as a whole. It is therefore of vital importance that we all contact our local MPs and request them to support this bill at this stage and to support the legal recognition of our identity in overall political discourse. 

As part of this, it is our responsibility to educate our representatives on what it actually means to be non-binary and how this is distinct from those who are gender-nonconforming, binary-transgender or transsexual. Included below are links to some documents that I believe could be helpful for us to provide a baseline understanding of what it means to be non-binary and why it is important for us to gain the legal recognition we deserve.

Hello Everyone,
This is more of a rant, but would love any advice or comments.

I have been out as nonbinary for about two years now. Like many people, I did so at a time that seemed extremely inopportune, but in hindsight was the exact time I needed to come out to myself — my second year of a PhD program, about 3 months after the hardest break up of my life, and at a time where many changes occurred in my family (my niece was born, my relationship with my immediate family was suffering, as I never came home). Looking back on it, I realize that it was the culmination of these events that allowed me the space to say what I had been feeling since my sister playful put me in a Cinderella costume when I was five and I felt beautiful. 

As I have come into my identity, my particular brand of nonbinary, I have learned a great deal about myself and honestly love myself so much more than I ever have. I also feel more affirmed in my identity as a Black queer person since coming to terms with my gender. My experience dating has often caused a great blow to my self-confidence though. Since I have initially come out, I’ve had 2 main relationships: 1) with a queer, cis-White women and 2)  with a White, queer, nonbinary person. Both people were great in many ways, but I never felt affirmed in my Blackness by either of them (or any White partners  in my life to be honest), despite clearly stating what I needed.

Since this time, I have tried Tinder, Okcupid, Lex, and Bumble. My problem has not been a lack of likes or matches, but the fact that when I talk to people they have 1) not done enough unpacking of their privileges, which manifests as rude questions, racist, or transphobic comments or 2) cis folks who like me, because they think I am an unproblematic man (to most I look like a cis-man). Now, I know that when dating cis people, you have to really break gender down to them, so I have. I expect that. What hurts a bit is that I don’t get many likes or matches from nonbinary or trans folx, because I don’t read as queer, despite it being very upfront on all of my profiles. It also kinda sucks that I don’t get a lot of likes from POCs. 

In short, I am just out here in the world trying to have a healthy, happy with a queer cutie. Do you all have any other suggestions for data apps? Or sites to meet trans and nonbinary folks, preferable of color? If it helps, I am 27, live within 2 hours of a major metropolitan city and 30 minutes of a midsized city.

2020-08-21 03:48:37,idpi6a,9,1,"Hi, my situation is that I am interested in low-dose T, but extremely confused about to what end I want it for. I don't have any close friends who are trans, and talking to my partner just makes me even more confused. I have been spiraling and spiraling recently and can't think about anything else.

Below I describe in a lot of detail where I am coming from, but **the tl;dr is:** *what is the difference in your experience between ""I hate being a woman because of all the things people think being a woman means and want to escape that"" and ""I identify as not-a-woman""?* 

- - -

Usually a few times a year, I experience days where I utterly loath my body and wish strongly that I had a different one, either androgynous or masculine. This started when I was in 7th grade, when everyone went through puberty, and I could not stand what my body turned into. Especially the growth of my breasts. All I wore for years was super baggy tshirts and oversized fleeces, and bore nonstop vitriol from my mother about not dressing correctly, and was so delighted when anyone thought I was a boy upon first encounter. All I wanted was to look like what the boys around me had suddenly grown into, I felt like they had left me behind. 

Sometime in high school, I felt that I more or less grew to accept that this body is the hand I was dealt. And then partway through university, I started to sometimes like what I saw in the mirror. Since I graduated, I have thought about it less and less, but still regularly have days where I know if I don't completely shut the thoughts down right away, they would spiral into an obsession. I never knew about the concept of being trans until late high school, and didn't know about non-binarity until university. My feelings now center much more around how others perceive me and how I go through the world as a woman, I rarely have body dysmorphia anymore. 

A few days after I turned 23, I bought a binder, because it marked about 10 years since I started feeling the way I do. It came in the mail a few weeks ago, and I have worn it a few times since. 

I was devastated by it - it didn't do anything at all; it flattens my chest a bit, but I look the same. I don't know what I expected, this all is something I rarely let myself think or talk about, and getting a binder felt like such a huge deal to me, and it just. It's just a really tight sports bra. It didn't change anything.

&amp;#x200B;

A few nights ago I had a bit of a weepy breakdown talking to a friend about this, who asked if I had ever considered taking T. I had gone on internet dives of looking at people's documentations of their MTF transitions, but I had never considered it for myself, because I don't identify as a man. I also thought I would never pass as anything but what I 'am' - very feminine looking Asian, 5 foot nothing, really curvy for my height, and really round and soft features. 

After the thought was in my head though, I just couldn't stop thinking about it. I have also recently followed some people on social media who are genderqueer and present purposefully ambiguously, which I hadn't realized people could do. I live in NYC and I found out that it's comparatively accessible to get on T through Planned Parenthood here. I started looking into booking an appointment, but was still unsure.   


I had a conversation with my partner last night where I told him about these feelings. He asked why I wanted to change my body - and I listed all the reasons I didn't like being a woman, a lot of which are about how other people perceive and react to me, and how it affects how I move through the world, and how it affects how I behave in reaction to other people's assumptions. One thing we ended up discussing, which sent me spiraling further, was, the idea of changing your body because of how other people react to you and what other people think. He said, 'isn't that their problem and not yours?', and also that the things I hated about being a woman, all come from the made-up idea of a 'woman' that people have pushed onto me. An analogy he made was, if someone bullied you for your clothes, would you go buy a new wardrobe? 

Because I don't experience as much body dysmorphia, my fixation on low-dose T is solely about changing how other people react to me, and not to cure dysmorphic feelings. Though I would love to have my body be more androgynous or masculine, I have long accepted that it is unlikely with my body type. I do agree with many of the things that came up in the conversation with my partner. Afterwards though, I have been struggling with feeling that changing my body to make people treat me different would be because I'm not strong enough to just not care.

It didn\'t change anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few nights ago I had a bit of a weepy breakdown talking to a friend about this, who asked if I had ever considered taking T. I had gone on internet dives of looking at people\'s documentations of their MTF transitions, but I had never considered it for myself, because I don\'t identify as a man. I also thought I would never pass as anything but what I \'am\' - very feminine looking Asian, 5 foot nothing, really curvy for my height, and really round and soft features. \n\nAfter the thought was in my head though, I just couldn\'t stop thinking about it. I have also recently followed some people on social media who are genderqueer and present purposefully ambiguously, which I hadn\'t realized people could do. I live in NYC and I found out that it\'s comparatively accessible to get on T through Planned Parenthood here. I started looking into booking an appointment, but was still unsure.   \n\n\nI had a conversation with my partner last night where I told him about these feelings. He asked why I wanted to change my body - and I listed all the reasons I didn\'t like being a woman, a lot of which are about how other people perceive and react to me, and how it affects how I move through the world, and how it affects how I behave in reaction to other people\'s assumptions. One thing we ended up discussing, which sent me spiraling further, was, the idea of changing your body because of how other people react to you and what other people think. He said, \'isn\'t that their problem and not yours?\', and also that the things I hated about being a woman, all come from the made-up idea of a \'woman\' that people have pushed onto me. An analogy he made was, if someone bullied you for your clothes, would you go buy a new wardrobe? \n\nBecause I don\'t experience as much body dysmorphia, my fixation on low-dose T is solely about changing how other people react to me, and not to cure dysmorphic feelings. Though I would love to have my body be more androgynous or masculine, I have long accepted that it is unlikely with my body type. I do agree with many of the things that came up in the conversation with my partner. Afterwards though, I have been struggling with feeling that changing my body to make people treat me different would be because I\'m not strong enough to just not care. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know this is really a lot of jumbled thoughts, I just don\'t know who to talk to about this. I would really appreciate any thoughts from anyone that empathize with any of these feelings!', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'I am extremely confused, at the core of everything I cannot figure out for myself what is the difference between ""I hate being a woman and wish I wasn\'t one"" and ""my gender identity is something-other-than-woman"".

Growing up and even now (I'm 27) I find it hard to identify with other cishet men, there just seems to be some kind of  disconnect in our thinking and actions that makes me think I'm different.

My partner(18) (biological female) identifies as NB and I am a cis male(18). We are both bi/pansexual so I guess I am also LGBT but I do not really involve myself in the community. 

Their parents are very conservative in the wrong way. If I am ever with them I will not even mention anything relating to LGBT. They very much believe in gender norms and are extremely judge mental. They would not even let her/them get a shorter hair cut than what they had (still 4x the length of my hair). Recently they drove to an appointment themselves and got it cut anyways. 

We both can agree on topics like gender norms and roles. Forced identities depending on your sex are hurtful, etc. But I do not really know about being trans/NB.

Although since then I have learned to respect other’s beliefs even if I do not understand. Along with that I will still stand for your right to express them.

So I have a few questions, like for pronouns, I think they do not care. Most of the time I just use a mix of she/her they/them as I think they do not have much of a preference. Of course I want to respect them anyways.

And why exactly does one identify as non binary? Does it just stand for non-conformity? What are some good things to support and validate them?

Last, I have no idea on how they may feel sexually. I do not know if they have any gender or body dysmorphia or are even okay with the concept. They have been assaulted which I know has caused some issues but I guess that is a conversation for us. But is there a common trend for NBs to feel dysmorphia? And how would we handle that?

2020-08-21 20:08:01,ie48gl,39,1,"Your friendly local Dumbfuck here, and i really REALLY struggle to be supportive of Nonbinary folks.  
While i believe that their gender does not define who they are, and while i want to believe their gender is an actual thing, and even though i have been sent a mountain of evidence by one of my friends, i still don't think i can believe that being non binary is an actuall situation one can find themselves in. the studies i have been shown, are focused on trans people, something i already believe in, and fully support. however a lot of the time, i simply don't see the full support for nonbinary being an actuall thing.  


I do however know what it would take to change my mind:  


Again i would love to believe that Nonbinary is an actuall thing, only i would need a study done EXCLUSIVLY on people who have been nonbinary for a long time, and who have not gotten a single doubt within their minds about their gender. the study done could be things such as brain scans, to check activity, or even hormonal tests, to see a consistent imballance. on top of that have straight people and straight people ALONE as a controll group, to have something to compare the evidence too and lastly have it be on HUNDREDS of people who are straight, and HUNDREDS of people who are non-binary. if the results show that there is a consistent observable difference compared to straight people, my mind would be instantly changed, no doubt about it. but if the results are all over the place, too simular or not consistent enough across all subjects, then i think my position sadly wouldn't change  


I have tried talking to certain friends of mine about this subject, and what i would like to see, but they keep shutting me down, insisting i am somehow morally wrong, for wanting what in my mind is simple proof, i hope that the folks here can understand at the very least

So, I had a conversation with my friend earlier where I elaborated more about me being trans/NB. And it lead me to think even deeper about why my end goal is.

If it's even... 'acceptable'? Because changing your body is not 100% permanent but changing it twice can make things worse.

I'm 160\~cm/5'2, weigh 57kg/125lbs and my chest size is a European D. I've always been insecure about how big my chest is and have been slut-shamed by other kids ever since I was 9. And got body image issues thanks to my parents and the Islamic environment I grew up in.

I've always wanted to make changes to my body so I can finally feel at home within myself. But that's where problems begin to surface...

I don't wanna go full FTM with surgeries and everything. I want to reduce my chest size to a B instead of completely removing it. I'd love to do a full bottom surgery but the thought still scares me. And the idea of going on T sounds great but I'm scared I won't like it and I'll have to detransition.....

And ad onto that my fear of hospitals! I want a hysterectomy more than anything, and everything else mentioned above, but the fear gets in the way! The fear of being operated on, being unconscious for an hour or more, bleeding a lot and any following health consequences...

Something in me tells me I'm not cut out for this or don't deserve this. I've tried living with my natural-born body for 18 years now and I only feel more and more like shit every day. I'd feel much more at home in a more male looking body, I've felt like this for years now.

I'm 23 years old. Back in 2016, I came out as non-binary. Many of my friends were extremely supportive. My family not so much, but some of them have come around. There's still progress to be made there. Anyway, when I came out, I decided I wanted to change my name to something more gender neutral. I wanted my name to match how I feel, neutral and could go both ways. My dead name is Kayla, and when I was deciding on names, I had three possibilities I was looking at - Kaiden, Jordan or Dakota. These were the three that kept floating around. There were others, but they were very unique, and I didn't want to push the little family tolerance I had any further. After a lot of mental turmoil, I decided that Kaiden would be best as I could still be called Kay, and that would make the new name and pronouns easier for my friends and family to get used to. 

I like this name, and I've been going by it for 4 years now,, but I didn't choose it just for me. And lately I've felt like there's a better name for me somewhere out there. I haven't really decided. I still love the name Dakota, and there's others I've been floating around, but I want to make sure I choose it because it suits me. However, I'm afraid that there's going to be backlash between myself, my friends and my family over it. I don't want them to think I'm just changing names for attention or anything. It was hard enough for them to adjust to Kaiden. But I just dont think thats me. 

So I guess my question is, when it comes to being non-binary, or just trying to find who I am even, is it normal to change my name multiple times until I find ""the one"" name that fits? And how do I breach that with the least push back? Or, how do I cope with what backlash may come from it?",NonBinary,I'm feeling nervous.

2020-08-22 12:42:18,iehr5j,0,1,"Hellooo friends, I’ve been trying to figure out how I feel about my gender and what exactly I best identify with for years, and I don’t feel much closer to knowing now at 22 than I did at 17. So I decided to come here and, I guess, get advice from actual enbies, or validation or something. I’m AFAB and currently publicly identify as a cis woman, but in all honesty I often feel deeply uncomfortable with that label. But then, not always. Sometimes I’m fine with it. 

The closest but still not-quite-right label that I can find for how I feel most of the time is demigirl. But I just don’t feel like that all the time. Sometimes I just feel like a woman, most of the time that something similar to a demigirl, sometimes something else entirely that I can’t really pin down other than being closer to the masculine corner of the spectrum but still with some femininity, and occasionally just completely agender. Is that a kind of genderfluidity? Because everything I’ve heard/read/seen about genderfluidity suggests that it’s about moving between the binary genders, rather than between one binary gender and one or more non-binary genders.

This whole identity crisis has kinda come to a head recently because I opened up about it a bit for the first time to a non-binary friend last month, and they responded with so much love and understanding and they said that they’d support me whether I decide that I’m a he, they, she, or anything else and I was just so emotional hearing that, I just burst into tears (the good kind), especially when they said I could be a they. I’m kinda tearing up just writing this. So that kinda told me that yeah, there’s definitely something there and I’m not just making it up or whatever.

But at the same time idk I just don’t know if I’d be valid if I came out as non-binary because I’m AFAB and most of the time identify fairly closely with femininity? I don’t want to be seen as just a cis woman trying to be special, I’ve seen a lot of people saying that AFAB enbies who identify so closely and so often with femininity “don’t count” and even though I am STRONGLY of the opinion that all enbies are valid no matter what and I have fought multiple people on it in the past, I guess that kinda rhetoric’s got me really down about myself and made me scared to try and claim that label, especially since sometimes I do just.. feel like a woman :( 

And I realise reading over this that I start with saying “I don’t know if I’m an enby” and basically end with “I’m pretty sure I’m enby but I’m scared I’m not valid so I’m very hesitant to claim any of those labels” so it looks like I’ve come to a decision and just need a push, but this is the thought cycle I’ve been stuck in for years. I basically go “I don’t know” -&gt; “I’m pretty sure I know but what if I’m wrong” -&gt; “I’m probably just a cis woman who wants to be special” -&gt; “yeah I’m definitely just a cis woman” -&gt; “wait but I don’t think I feel like a woman right now” -&gt; “I don’t know”, repeat ad infinitum.

But recently I’ve been thinking about using he/him pronouns and even picked a name for myself to call me along with my given birth name since I am comfortable with both.

I’ve been thinking about being in a binder/being more masculine, I’ve always shown some sort of masculine trait for years but it hasn’t been this prominent.

I’ve started to be in more masculine clothing and even cut my hair. But I’m still confused about it? I honestly don’t know if this is just gender dysphoria or something else..?

But I’ve got another problem.. my boyfriend. 

I’ve been with him for 8 months now and he is very supportive of me being non binary and has used the pronouns I’ve said to use. 

However he is straight, he has no attraction to anyone identifying as male at all. And I’m scared to lose him if I put he/him pronouns in the picture.

2020-08-23 13:04:12,if2tgp,3,1,"Hey everyone,
I‘m afab, 29, have really female (not so common but still easily recognizable) name, live in Germany, have a job where lots of people see/read/hear/know my name (i‘m not famous or anything but my company is and i‘m one of their diversity&amp;gender coordinators) and recently discovered i don’t want to live as a woman anymore. I’m totally fine with the 29 years i‘ve spent like that, but now is the time to let my true self come to life. I want to live trans masc but am not sure yet, if it’s gonna be enby or male... time will tell i guess. But i‘m 100% sure i won’t go back to living as a cis-woman/into the closet. Not gonna happen

Soooo i‘ve started thinking about a new name. Since it won’t be possible to officially change it for at least a year i thought of a smooth way around:
If i choose a new name with the same initials, i can ask my company to only display my initials (e.g. my mailadress aso) so whoever looks me up will not know my gender and the whole transitioning/figuring out process will be a lot easier. Plus if i have to apply somewhere else (i have a time-limited job so that might happen soon), my documents won’t cause that much confusion :) 
As a child i loved books about people with names from non-european cultures. I loved how they sounded warm, interesting and genderless to me. And i don’t like the german neutral names with my initials so i thought this could be an option to look up...

My 1. question is: do you know where i can look up neutral names? 
My 2. question is: if i choose a name, which is not german/european, besides giving me weird comments for not looking as foreign as my name sounds, would you call this cultural appropriation?

2020-08-23 19:14:26,if989y,7,1,"Hello, all. This is my first ever post on reddit. Tbh, I made an account on reddit specifically for crossdressing, trans, and enby related stuff. I'm 28, and I really only just started to identify as enby sometime around...uh...February? or March? I've always kinda joked with people about how I ""didn't really count"" whenever talking about things that were girls only or boys only, and liked hanging out with female friends and doing ""girl stuff"" just as much as some of the ""boy stuff"" (if not sometimes moreso). 

Recently however, I started experimenting with makeup and different outfits, and it's been a lot of fun so far. It's mostly just been around the house, or with certain friends, tho. I've only told a handful of people, including my wife and my mom (who've both been super supportive of everything so far). I've tried dressing up to go out a couple of times, but I usually get super anxious about it after a short while. I just don't really feel comfortable expressing myself in public, yet; like everyone's just thinking I'm some kind of freak or pervert, or something.

Friends always tell me things like ""they don't matter"" or ""you look fine, just be you,"" and I would agree if I was talking about someone else, but I just can't shake that feeling. It doesn't help that my hair is starting to thin right as I'm exploring this new side of myself. I'm working on small stuff to improve my overall self-confidence like weight loss and skin care, but I wish gender wasn't such a big societal THING. I just want to be cute sometimes without feeling like everyone's staring at me. I know I'm not the only person to experience this, and I imagine it gets a little easier to deal with over time, but WOW does it suck.

2020-08-24 00:56:19,iff64k,2,1,"I’m AFAB, and I’ve identified as a nonbinary lesbian for a couple years. The thing is I’m not sure if “nonbinary” is exactly how I want to describe myself. I don’t have strong dysphoria, but I’ve never really felt like I wanted to be physically female. I hate periods and anything involving pregnancy or the female reproductive system freaks me out. Like, I actually think that the female reproductive system is kinda cool, but thinking about it in my body feels weird. I also have some slight dysphoria around my chest, I usually wear tight sports bras and have thought about getting a breast reduction, though I also find that I like showing off my boobies around other women and I don’t think I’d ever want to fully get rid of them.

My presentation is also complicated. I’ve always been tomboy-ish, and masculine clothing has always felt the most natural. I also use a more androgynous/slightly masculine nickname, I don’t shave, and I use some masculine terms for myself (I really like “soft boy” lol). However I also love feminine fashion, just acting more feminine in general, and sometimes classify myself as a femme. The difference is masculine presentation feels like a more accurate portrayal of who I am, whereas feminine presentation feels more like an intentional performance.

To sum things up: I am AFAB, I identify as a lesbian and feel that lesbianism is the only thing truly tying me to womanhood, I feel slight dysphoria and masculine presentation feels most natural to me, but I also describe myself as femme and tend to intentionally present more feminine because I find engaging in voluntary playful femininity to be fun and somewhat empowering.

I’m fine with using the term “nonbinary lesbian” most of the time, but I also want a more specific term to provide more detail when necessary. I guess mostly what I wanna convey with this is femme-ish lesbianism mixed with soft masculinity.

Some things I’ve considered are:

\- Lesbian soft boy (I used this one once and had someone got mad at me abt it ;-;)

\- Femme boy (I think the wordplay is rlly fun, but I don’t like the sexual connotations)

\- Transmasc femme

\- Femme demiboy

2020-08-24 16:30:14,ifsbdn,5,1,"(tagged support, but it's also ranty)

The title kinda says it, basically. As I come out to more people I find it's my friends who are the least connected by direct personal experience to trans/queer identities who push back hardest -- the weird part being they do it in this way where it's like they're claiming to have *more* knowledge/understanding of trans/queer identities than I do. Like I've gotten a few versions of ""ehh idk, you don't seem trans to me, I think of you more as a kinda fem gay guy, did you even consider that as a possibility?"" And it's like... yes? I did actually? And I identified that way for a very long time even, *as I know you know because you have known me for years*? But now for social-dysphoria and body-dysphoria reasons that's not working anymore? I think you probably can't imagine how much time I've spent considering literally every possibility here? These are guys who take pride in how cool and open-minded they are and how important it is to them not to be too sure about anything they believe, but I start talking about transgender stuff and they become goddamn Socrates, demanding to be persuaded that every little feeling ""really means"" what it does mean to me and that I let them skeptically cross-examine me on everything as they flail around for a way to minimize and dismiss it all. It's exhausting.

It's almost like when I come to them with my feelings -- including honesty about where I'm uncertain, what I feel ambivalence/ambiguity about -- they see a Problem to leap on and Solve as quickly as possible, which they're gonna help me out with in a quick flash of awesome insight using Reason and Logic. (I'm invoking a jokey stereotype about men here, but the shoe does happen to fit fabulously.) When I share that sometimes ""I'm binary trans"" feels like a possibility, not in a ""lightning bolt of unshakeable certainty"" way but in a ""hmm, that *would* click a bunch of things into place"" way, that's like a bomb they have to defuse. They're hunched over the bomb sweating, holding wire cutters in their teeth, assuring me over and over that the bomb does not scare them in any way, that they ""don't care"" about the bomb, the bomb doesn't change anything, the bomb is really not a big deal at all, it's just do you really need to have this bomb here? Are you really completely sure this bomb is right for you?

I'm trying to look at this as simply their problem. Maybe they feel a threat to our friendship somehow. Or (to be more amateur-psychoanalyst about it), since they've had to figure out their own way to deal with masculinity and still identify with it, my own wish to purge myself of masculinity as much as possible suggests they *could* in some possible world want that too and that can be weird and scary to think about. But, these are friends I've been close to for a long time and so their skepticism, as obnoxious and insistent as it is, amps up insecurity I already have about transitioning and how much I can ""get away with.""

I want to avoid saying ""I just have too many cis het guy friends"" but I kinda suspect sometimes that I just have too many cis het guy friends.

As I come out to more people I find it\'s my friends who are the least connected by direct personal experience to trans/queer identities who push back hardest -- the weird part being they do it in this way where it\'s like they\'re claiming to have *more* knowledge/understanding of trans/queer identities than I do. Like I\'ve gotten a few versions of ""ehh idk, you don\'t seem trans to me, I think of you more as a kinda fem gay guy, did you even consider that as a possibility?"" And it\'s like... yes? I did actually? And I identified that way for a very long time even, *as I know you know because you have known me for years*? But now for social-dysphoria and body-dysphoria reasons that\'s not working anymore? I think you probably can\'t imagine how much time I\'ve spent considering literally every possibility here? These are guys who take pride in how cool and open-minded they are and how important it is to them not to be too sure about anything they believe, but I start talking about transgender stuff and they become goddamn Socrates, demanding to be persuaded that every little feeling ""really means"" what it does mean to me and that I let them skeptically cross-examine me on everything as they flail around for a way to minimize and dismiss it all. It\'s exhausting.\n\nIt\'s almost like when I come to them with my feelings -- including honesty about where I\'m uncertain, what I feel ambivalence/ambiguity about -- they see a Problem to leap on and Solve as quickly as possible, which they\'re gonna help me out with in a quick flash of awesome insight using Reason and Logic. (I\'m invoking a jokey stereotype about men here, but the shoe does happen to fit fabulously.) When I share that sometimes ""I\'m binary trans"" feels like a possibility, not in a ""lightning bolt of unshakeable certainty"" way but in a ""hmm, that *would* click a bunch of things into place"" way, that\'s like a bomb they have to defuse. They\'re hunched over the bomb sweating, holding wire cutters in their teeth, assuring me over and over that the bomb does not scare them in any way, that they ""don\'t care"" about the bomb, the bomb doesn\'t change anything, the bomb is really not a big deal at all, it\'s just do you really need to have this bomb here?

We have a child together (biologically hers). I have been out of the closet as a lesbian since I was 18, prior to that I knew I was attracted to women but wasn’t “allowed” to be gay given my religious upbringing. I was raised in a very religious household with very strict gender roles. I was told women stay home and raise kids, women wear dresses and mind their manners.

2020-08-24 21:17:31,ify3jv,2,1,"Warning long text but I will be so grateful if you read it and comment what you think 😊

First of I am 21 and seriously I am questioning from 5-6 years but did stuff indicating dysphoria before that like pulling your shit to hide your chest. To be fair I actually saw myself just as me at that time ,the word girl was what other people called me so I was thinking I am one.I have strong desire to have top but some of.my thought makes it hard for me to feel valid and trans enough to have it .

My dysphoria isn't constant in some days I just don't feel it or feeling this numb feeling . Not each day I want to die when I put sports bra or normal one but still will never show outside home like that. In some days binder makes my dysphoria worse in others I feel like people can see through the binder and I feel like fraud [ I will put copy of my post on Instagram about regarding binding and how I feel about it].
 
 I can't pick name and label ,I am pretty sure it is either nonbinary trans , agender or genderfluid. Jere where I live we don't have nb or theyq so when I am at home it is kind of tolerable because no one sees me,but outside I feel I must pick a side. And because of all that I am afraid I may regret TOP but I want it so so so bad even when I feel ok seeing my chest [ I feel less discomfort sometimes without clothes but not all the time ] And this numb feeling is terrible as if I have cotton or black hole in my mind I just walk do things but can't feel my interactions with the world and the emotions it makes me feel. I feel empty and can't connect to my sence of self or my emotions as if the file in my head for gender and identity don't exist ,this is probably depersonalisation one of the less unknown signs of dysphoria. 

I have this thing that sometimes I don't feel anything when I wake up for 30 min to one hour, and sometimes if I feel ok. In days like this my mind decides to scream at me that just because in this day I are willing to go out with bra and I will tolerate it/ don't find it repulsive I am girl and this means I am confused cis so I will never get TOP surgery because it is mutilation and then I put the binder because I don't want to make it more obvious that I am born AFAB but it too feel wrong and so I try to not cry by distracting myself [ also my skin is itching because of the binder]
 
 Because most people find new name and pronounce and ect I feel bad or not trans enough to change something because I don't have these things even label. I was thinking about being agender too in my case I have like core identity and in some days I feel it's external part more feminine [ more line neutral or a bit fem ] or masculine if that makes sense. But what remains is my desire for TOP my behaviour is the one that changes ,I act more flamboyant.

Someone I know told me that most of my thoughts are coming from interested transphobia and I think it might be true but it is so weird because from as long as I can remember no matter the fact that my parents aren't pro LGBTQ I always was ally and 10000% believe trans and nb people exist

How my bran makes me see things is that I must suffer as that trans guy that can't even shower or look at himself and is in constant agony in order to be valid and have the right to make change and this apply only for me ,like i will not judge someone for that or at least i thought that because in my mind they know themselves or have stronger dysphoria than me with . Similar thing apply about the name and label - if i don`t know them before all else I don`t feel really this way and so I can`t trust my instinct to have top that is what my mind is telling me .

 This below is copy of the text I posted on my Instagram;

I had several insta profiles before and posted my art there but it wasn't my thing and still isn't.The reason I made insta is to help myself. I want to find answers to the many questions and doubts I have but also I want to show this side of the coin that I almost never see the side of constant doubts the side way before the clear answer.

It was long joinery for me to get #binder because at that time when I decided I want one I also wanted to keep it secret from my parents. It was about a year ago. The first one that I payed for and a friend bought for me was tank top #gc2b but it was too small. After I found someone to use it I waited about a month to buy new one this time the short version and one size bigger [The one you see on the pic]. I have short hands so I couldn't put it on because my hands couldn't touch the part that was rolled up in the back. And so I bough one more after about 1 to 3 months. Finally I could wear it! It was white tank top. With time I learned to use this one too.

But after some time it stopped being ok. Yes it was cool to have flat chest but even with it I hunch my back a lot to the point I am afraid I may not be able to correct my posture after I stop doing it. The binder makes my skin itchy and that along side with the pressing on my chest makes it hard for me to not pay attention to it. 

Instead of feeling better I feel worse because I think that I am a fraud ,I feel as if people can see through my T-shirt and the binder and know I still have these things there. It makes be doubt my validity and my right to have TOP surgery because I feel uncomfortable with the binder on.

The illusion I had that the binder will be this magical item that will make everything ok it sometimes true for some people but not for me .And despite all that I still wear it because even if I feel less dysphoric with sports bra because it is easier to not pay attention to it wearing bra will destroy the small chance of someone using he not she so I will continue wear it .",NonBinary,I am so tired of constantly not being sure is I am trans enough to make a change.

I don’t like to to look like a sexual being, lots of people say I dress younger than I am and think I’m a teenager.

So here is the deal: I realized, that I'm nonbinary about a year ago. And since than I'm struggling to find a gender neutral name. I cannot even come out properly, because... what would I say?

The problem is, that my native language (russian) is gendered. So every noun has a gender. I mean, even if I choose to call myself Fern - this would be a masculine name. River would be feminine etc.

It’s in the very beginning stages and I don’t really have many followers, so I thought I’d post here about it.  Basically, it’s for a class I’m taking, but I’m also going to be continuing to maintain it after I turn it in.  I’m asking folks to use the “Ask Me Anything” feature to post queer sex ed advice to younger queer folks they wish they knew when they were younger or questions wish they knew the answers to now.  It can also be a space to ask other questions about being queer or discovering one’s identity and share advice, links, or other resources.  However you choose to participate, I would super love and appreciate it.  My most recent post on the Tumblr has more details about this campaign!  Hopefully, I’ll be able to flesh it out and get some professionals to help me answer questions in the future.  Here is the link if you’re interested: https://thingsiwishmyqueerasslearned.tumblr.com

In my country transgenderism is defined as a gender identity different from your natal sex.

I have always identified as NB, transsexual but not transgender - I have separated the two:

Transsexual - (involving your natal sex) if you change your body to accustom your gender (ex. Hrt, operations etc.)

Transgender - (involving your gender identification) a person who does not identify with their natal sex

I have never considered myself transgender as I believe that gender is a construct - thus I am not transgender because in the beginning I wasn't any gender.

I do prefer being referred to as the opposite gender from the one I was assigned at birth, but that's mostly because it contradicts the perception that usually triggers the dysphoria and no one ever *really* treats me as that gender, so it can't trigger anything by itself.

I just recently came out as Bigender, but I hate to say having gender dysphoria is really fucking maddening a lot of the time. It’s so fucking rough on my mental health. Like explaining why my hair getting longer (due to not being able to get cut during quarantine) makes me feel like I want to kill myself is hard to say. Not that I’m going to. But it really makes me hate myself, feel disgusted with myself, I just don’t feel okay. I deal with gender dysphoria in so many ways. Like many times over the years I felt like just coming out as a transman, but that didn’t exactly feel right either for me. Which of course it didn’t because I am both male and female at the same time. Bigender is who I truly am. Sometimes I just want to start T for a couple months just for I’d look more androgynous and not hate myself and my body. It’s still something I think about, but that also makes me nervous to make such a big permanent change. So I’m not fully ready for that yet. Even as a child I couldn’t stand my mother doing my hair, or putting me in dresses and I would just breakdown crying because I hated how I looked. She eventually got sick of it and just cut my hair short and let me wear more clothes I was comfortable in, and that helped quite a bit, but it was just never enough. I was just often referred to as a tomboy, but it was always so much deeper than that. In my teen years I tried looking more feminine because that was expected, but even then it just made me so depressed and so I gave up, got my hair cut short, it helped, like it did when I was a kid. Not wearing girl shirts and only sports bras help (though I really need a binder) with it. Still it doesn’t always. I sometimes want to wear dresses, but if I don’t have leggings that help feel like pants and feel more mixed of feminine and masculine, I just panic and constantly need reassurance that I look okay. Which I hate. But if I look to feminine or masculine and only just one of the two, I feel like I just want to curl up and die. It’s so distressing. There’s so many other things that make my gender dysphoria so bad. I really want to find the right balance of being able to express my true gender and true self to help with it all. Which now that I’m finally out, it definitely is helping and making me happier, but I know I still have a way to go with finally just being okay.",NonBinary,I’m Bigender and my gender dysphoria is getting to me bad lately,1598477799.0,"{'created_utc': 1598452599, 'id': 'igzzfi', 'num_comments': 1, 'score': 1, 'selftext': '\n\nI just recently came out as Bigender, but I hate to say having gender dysphoria is really fucking maddening a lot of the time.

I'm Demigender (I use Neutrois/Agender and Genderqueer respectively) so as a Non-binary person I have a strong disconnect to any gendered parts of my body. I'm AFAB and for example, I look down at my chest and just kinda like, ""Yep, that's something that is attached to me."" If I didn't have them I know I'd feel the same way. 

However, the few things that give me dysphoria are my genitals. To be specific, my internal sex organs and the fact that I have the ability to get pregnant, it almost makes me feel sick. And I already plan on having a full hysterectomy some time in the future.

That being said, I also have a strong feeling that what my genitals look like is not how they are supposed to. I have a huge yearning to have some kind of penis. I feel like that's what I was supposed to have. Some kind of mix between vag in penis. 

So here brings the question, do you know if there's any way that any of you know of, where I could potentially get bottom surgery without getting top surgery first. And also a way where I could get top surgery without having to fully get rid of my vag. 

And there are a few things I already know. I would have to get on testostrone. Already on it and totally fine. And I know I would have to live as ""male"" which I'm also just fine with. I have a binder that I use from time to time and if that's what I needed to do I'd more then happily use it more regularly.

I've recently started to think of myself as nonbinary. And it feels waaayyyy more significant than when I found out I was pansexual. It's on another level, way deeper than sexual orientation. And it's something I've always said, in a way, without thinking much about it, I just didn't know it was called nonbinary. 

I don't know about my pronouns yet. Do they systematically change when one finds out they're nonbinary?
I never fully identified as a woman, but in the other hand I identify only partially as a man. And it feels weird to say 'as a man', it's feels truer to say I identify somewhat as a boy. Maybe because the boy part in me is not interested in dating and sexual activity? 
Does anybody else relate to that? 

Also, I am autistic. I've always been masking, and I WANT TO UNMASK EVERYTHING, the autistic stuff and the nonbinary stuff. But I don't know how to do that. Glowup tips and advice needed.

I want to kind of get a feel for how long you guys have known because I'm currently questioning.

Takes place in Ohio, total process: 8 months, total necessary cost: 205$

- Timeline breakdown -

PRE-Legal process: time varies

Many years ago: wanted to change my name; January: realized I'm NB and picked a name; [???]: submitted application to government

LEGAL Process: 4 months

May: payment (180$) got processed; May-July: changed my name in as many systems as I could without The Document; July: court call and quickly received The Document

POST-Legal Process: 2 months

July: changed my name in as many systems as I could with *only* The Document and applied for a new Social Security card; August: received SS card, applied for new ID (25$), confirmed my ID number will not change, and change my name in systems which require SS/ID information

- Story stuff -

This took a lot longer than I expected, and I didn't realize government buildings would be shut down during the pandemic! So my court hearing was over the phone, plus all documents were sent and received by mail only.

I picked my name in a rush despite having wanted to change it for many years. I didn't bother correcting *most* people. If I cared a lot about them, I'd correct them. In new places, I used my new name. Most people, who I'd known prior to the change but not cared for deeply or were required to know my then-legal name (doctors, etc.), I didn't bother to correct them.

The Document is very important. It's what you need in order to change your name on the *rest* of your documents. It's just a signed and sealed letter from the court saying, this is your name now. Because it was done by mail, I only received 2 copies. Thankfully, I do not think more are needed. I still have both.

Applying for a SS card is hard, and I knew beforehand because my dumb ass lost one. You mail them *original* documents only. I still haven't gotten my old ID back, but thankfully I do not need it.

""Necessary cost"" of course varies by state. *Unnecessary* costs would be, services that help you make a checklist of documents you need, places to change your name, and *how* to tell them your name changed. I did pay for one service, but I do not recommend it. You will have *plenty* of time to make your own lists between applying and court. It is also important to *not* look at services geared towards marriage name changes. (I accidentally paid for one...they kindly refunded and canceled it.)

I’m able to find myself cute and and even adorable in the mirror but as soon as I record a video of myself I’m reminded of the way I look as a whole and am disturbed. It just sucks and I don’t know what to do or where to begin on my new journey to self love.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Feeling ugly', 'created': 1598560980.0}"

So I’m looking for advice/recommendations. I’m a transmasculine nb person, and just made an appointment with a doctor to talk about starting on testosterone, which I’ve been thinking about for more than a year now. My partner is a cis guy who, prior to me, had only dated cis women. We’ve been together more than a year now, and he’s always been incredible about seeing me as exactly who I am - correcting others on my pronouns when needed, addressing me in either gender-neutral or more masculine ways (i.e. calling me handsome, etc.). He seems very comfortable with me generally being a masculine-of-center person. But the idea of me pursuing elements of physical transition makes him anxious, even though he wants to be supportive and wants me to do what makes me happy. He’s worried that there will come a point where he’s less attracted to me, because he just hasn’t historically been particularly into guys (aside from one drunken makeout in college). And even though I don’t ID as a trans man, I definitely do want some amount of physical masculinization - deeper voice, more muscle tone, etc. I want to microdose T, so the changes should be fairly gradual and less dramatic than on a full dose, but there will still be changes. We had a big talk about it last night, and he wants to keep an open mind and try his best, but I know this is all new for him. And adjusting to big changes is always hard, especially when it involves reconsidering your own sexuality. 

I guess my question is: do y’all have any suggestions or recommendations to help him along? Obviously, just communicating openly between us will be the main thing. But I’m curious about whether others have experienced similar situations in relationships, and what, if anything, helped.

2020-08-27 19:51:40,ihs69d,2,1,"Hi folks!

I'm Abel, and lately I've been coming out as non-binary to basicly everyone I know. Whenever I meet someone I haven't seen in a while, I just straight up tell them I changed my first name and if they ask why, I tell them I'm non-binary and explain what npn-binary is if neccesary. So far it's actually been going much better than I dared dream, and the vast majorty of people I tell reacts with compassion and understanding.

The main thing I have stumbled upon though, is when people ask me ""why do you want to change your name/appearance/pronouns/etc."" or worst of all  ""why are you non-binary?"". I honestly don't know what to say to that, because it (obviously) isn't really a decision, it's just who I am and who I've always been. But even when I tell them that, they won't shut up about ""why"". At first, I stayed calm when someone asked me why, but the more often it happens the more annoyed I'm getting with it, and today I almost yelled at a friend I hadn't seen in a while because he asked me why I wanted to change my name if I'm not transgender. 

So anyways, do any of you have advice on dealing with the questions, or are there any of you with similair experiences?",NonBinary,Answering questions,1598583100.0,"{'created_utc': 1598557900, 'id': 'ihs69d', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Hi folks!\n\nI\'m Abel, and lately I\'ve been coming out as non-binary to basicly everyone I know.

I'm at college and I feel so free and happy that I'm able to express myself but I know anytime I go home someone is going to have a huge problem with my hair. I really don't want to have to deal with the soap opera that follows every haircut but I also want to start living and presenting how I want. I'm financially dependent on my parent atm because of school and I'm thinking about going to grad school but that would mean being under their thumb for that much longer. Any advice?  Anything would be greatly appreciated :). \n\nSorry for the length and cluster fuck that is my thought pattern lol."", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'I shaved my head lol', 'created': 1598622445.0}"

So I was born female and never really identified or felt comfortable with this and from the age of 4 presented as masculine as possible. I had a few periods where I tried to embrace being female but always reverted to very masculine-presenting. At 14 I identified as a trans man but never came out and eventually decided it was too difficult and repressed it for a few years choosing to embrace being a butch lesbian. However, I made some trans friends and eventually embraced being trans and identified as a trans man. I identified this way as I always wanted a male body.

I came out as male almost a year ago, and started Testosterone 4 months ago. I felt really positive about changes because it felt like I was getting closer and more comfortable with who I really am. However, it has felt like male pronouns are a bit awkward and I came out of lockdown suddenly passing as a man and it shook me a bit. After some time I love passing as male but still have some feelings of gender confusions over pronouns and wondering whether I want to embrace a more non binary identity or even gender fluid. 

I've wanted chest surgery since I learnt it was a thing, but now I'm wondering whether I might lose some identity I never knew I valued if I lose one of the last parts of my feminine identity. I hate my chest so would get a breast reduction if I didn't get chest surgery but am bloody confused. I'm worried I just wanted to be androgynous or something but I dunno.

I'm also considering doing micro-dose testosterone as I think I want to make the transition slower so I can keep an eye on it.

Like, everywhere online, I've been Demon online for 22 years, it's the only name that ever felt like my name. Because it's genderless.

Coming out as Agender/enby/Trans to my family, I explained how much I hate my name, how I often don't even respond to it as it's not my name so for now can we please start referring to me as Demon.

This is unacceptable to them, BTW, they're not religious before you ask.

They're worried people will find out someone calling themselves with such a name will create problems. That people will think I have mental health issues.

I've tried explaining to them just how diverse enby names are and got hit with ""do those people not realise how stupid there names are?"".

I immediately pulled them on how stupid all names are, my mam is named after a street. She then proudly declared how non binary that is while still being insanely ******* transphobic.

Demon, is a stop gap as if I ever go full legal change Demon is illegal in the U.K.

So I've been looking into names of Demon's as a good bridge.

Actually really liking Azazel, could go by Az socially as a nickname for people who hate the idea of unconventional names.

I think it would be allowed, not sure how to check on deedpoll.

But this too is ""outrageous"" and ""why can't you just stick with deadname?"".

Honestly, I'm not picking something intentionally to piss them off, but I'm about ready to go with that out of pure spite and malice because this has been the biggest damn issue since coming out to them and the reason all this took as long is I'd convinced myself I was just a straight cis because my family have uttered so much crap towards any Queer folk, Trans especially though, that I was petrified to find out just how different I was.

And it's certainly been ""fun"" I can tell ya.

Because my neo pronouns aren't at all offensive yet oh boy do they hate trying to say Ze Zis Zim.

So, bit of a rant over, should I just find a gender neutral name I can tolerate that's not at all got any gothic connotations to it?",NonBinary,I know this isn't AITA but I kinda need name help here and need to know if I'm being insanely unrealistic or if my family are just being douches.,1598659027.0,"{'created_utc': 1598633827, 'id': 'iiat5g', 'num_comments': 7, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'So, I\'m 33.

2020-08-28 20:20:44,iiep50,2,1,"ive been questioning my gender a lot, and because of my complex history with it im having a hard time navigating it without the advice of someone else. im not comfortable enough to talk to anyone in real life at the moment, so i hope people in this community can give me some advice. also warning: because my history with gender is long and complicated this will be a lengthy post! my apologies

from ages 12 to 13 i identified as a trans male. i tried flattening my chest, cried at night because i wasn’t biologically male, envied cis male bodies, and had a meltdown over getting my period. i picked a male name for myself and became very fascinated by trans youtubers online.

however, i only started to question my gender because of my masculine gender expression. i now realize this does not define my gender identity. at the same time, i was going through mental health problems and had pretty bad body image issues. this makes me think that a combination of gender nonconformity with low self esteem and general unhappiness led me to believe i had gender dysphoria. i was also very uncomfortable when being referred to as male in public, which is what led me to stop identifying as trans at around 13-14. adding onto this, i dealt with internalized homophobia at the time and thought that being a straight man was better than a lesbian woman.

i am now 17, and for the past three years i have been identifying as a cis butch woman. however, i still can’t get over my envy of cis male bodies. often when i see a man i am jealous of his chest, voice, body, facial structure, muscles, and other features. my own genitals freak me out and ive never even looked at myself down there before. the idea of binding and packing is very appealing to me. i still dislike being referred to as male in public, dont mind female, and really love when people can’t tell.

most of the time when i think about myself i dont think of gender. i dont really see myself as a woman, but i dont see myself as a man either. “he” makes me uncomfortable (possibly due to bad experiences in my youth when being mistaken for male), “she” doesn’t bother me that much, and “they” is very comfortable.

i suppose all of this points to nonbinary, but i struggle with giving up my identity as a woman. i would much rather have a masculine body, but “woman” is a label i have used for most of my life and i have grown very comfortable in the butch lesbian community. i feel somewhat in touch with my femininity and i experience attraction to women from a sapphic perspective.

Obviously, I was born a girl and up until now have never felt like it was the wrong gender for me. (i.e. i know i'm not transgender/ i don't identify as male).

Do you think this just has to do with my asexuality/liking to be covered up? Or could the non binary label  apply to me?  

Now, I would never want to walk around claiming I'm non binary if i don't fully understand what it means as to not insult those fierce people embracing it, but I have found myself constantly thinking that I may be non binary over these past few weeks.

I don't want something to completely flatten my chest, just reduce the silhouette. I'm not looking for a binder because I want something I can wear for most of the day, 7 days a week, and I know you can't wear binders for that amount of time.

I used to wear a 38C bra, and at the moment just wear L or XL sports bras. Ideally something under £20 would be great but I'm willing to pay more if it's worth the cost.

I took estrogen to help with dysphoria, and it helped when it came to body hair and general shape, but now I'm wanting to wear my binder more times than not, and some days I'm even thinking about getting a breast reduction or even a mastectomy. I've considered talking to my medical team about microdosing T, but I don't want it to make me grow facial hair or deepen my voice any more than puberty already did. On my particularly masculine days, I get simultaneously dysphoric and euphoric about how low my voice is, my body hair, etc. It's like I'm happy to be masculine and want to be seen as such, but abhor the thought of someone seeing me as a man. I desperately want to get GRS, but I don't want a typical vaginoplasty (but I also don't want to just leave *it* alone and get a vaginoplasty underneath). Many days, I find myself relating to trans men more than trans women, but I feel like I'm bad or transphobic for even saying so.

I can't help but think that if I had been born AFAB, I would have still transitioned. In many ways, I think I would have preferred that. Hell, even now, I'm considering just getting surgeries done and going on T afterwards, or getting a metoidioplasty afterwards. But I'm not trying to idealize or fetishize transmasc people, I just feel like my body and the transition path people with my type of body take isn't me.

Not to mention the way this affects my sexuality and my sex life. I'm sapphic when I'm feminine, achillean when I'm masculine, and generally just don't want my *body* to be involved in sex, but I want my *being* to be there. And of course, this leads to some complicated feelings towards my much more binary partners. I'm almost jealous of my (trans) boyfriend, I turn down cis guys bc they make me dysphoric, and my girlfriends are all super sweet, but sometimes I feel like there's a pressure to be more fem when I'm with them.

I don't know what to do. I don't know how I would get the surgery I want, what my long term transition would look like, or any of that. I'm scared that maybe I'm not trans and I made a mistake. And I know that most likely by tomorrow, my dysphoria will flip flop to the opposite.

For some time now I’ve (17F) felt like I’m not super happy with my appearance? Some days I’m mostly okay with presenting femininely but on a lot of days I end up trying to look just a bit androgynous such as tying up my hair and playing with multiple layers of desaturated colors. But also sometimes I wish my boobs were smaller or non-existent, but I’d also like to have the option to keep them? Like if they were an item from a game you could equip as you wished. 
I’ve floated the idea to myself that I would obtain a binder once I moved out for college just to see how it feels. I don’t feel like a boy. I am a girl but I feel like that’s just because biologically it’s what I am, I don’t usually feel very connected to it because I spent most of my life distanced from other girls and other traditionally feminine activities. So I’m still stuck not sure if I just want to change my gender presentation or if I really don’t feel totally like a girl
I feel like the aesthetic I’d like to achieve is a pretty boy look? I want others to have to second-glance me, I want to look androgynous but ultimately lean towards femininity. 
Also, I’ve had this weird thought trying to rationalize all that I’ve been feeling these past months... What if the reason I feel this way is because I’ve projected onto so many pretty male characters in video games and shows that now when I look in the mirror I’m thrown for a loop with how I really look?

I put on a self made binder a few weeks ago and I vividly remember the moment when I realized that this is what I always wanted my body to look like.. I’m just so afraid that I might be “faking it” for attention although nobody really knows anything about my gender identity.. \n\nWhat do y’all think? \n\n\n(Also please don’t make fun of my possible grammar/spelling mistakes I tried really hard to put my thoughts into words in another language 😅)', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'I‘m a confused mess..', 'created': 1598756855.0}"

2020-08-29 21:38:49,ij0rk5,1,1,"hi there

I'm hoping to maybe talk to some other afab enbies who've been on hormones about their experiences.

I'm just starting to really feel more comfortable with expressing my gender more authentically now that I feel better in my body. I've been on T for almost 5 years now, and I never thought this would happen but I'm considering stopping my injections... I just have some concerns about it.

For those of you who've had a similar experience, what was it like to stop T after a long time? What have/did you notice?

I'm concerned about a few things in particular:

\- it somehow affecting my chest... I've had top surgery, but I'm scared I'll end up having more tissue there again, which probably is my most pressing concern since that's one of the biggest sources of dysphoria for me.

\- other physical changes like voice and such

Hopefully this makes sense and is okay to post. I've tried researching this before, but I only seemed to find very TERF-y ""de-transition"" stories...

2020-08-30 16:17:42,ijfbeo,3,1,"Hi! This is my first time posting so please tell me if I do anything wrong (if I do I'm so sorry) So just a little background, I'm Bisexual (my identity is closer to pansexual but I'm to scared to reidentify and come out again) I came out to most of my family and friends after about a year of knowing and I came out to one friend about 6 months but she turned out to be extremely homophobic and scared me away from telling anyone for the remainder of that time because I thought her reaction was normal. When I came out to my mom for the first time she told me to not tell anyone or buy any pride merch which really discouraged me. The second time was much better and she apologized for how she originally handled it and such. 

Recently (around 2ish weeks ago) I realized I was nonbinary or demigirl and came out to my Genderfluid and Queer crush (I knew they would accept me as we have talked about it before) We had a couple conversations and I realized that I don't get dysphoria but I do have major insecurities about my more feminine features (I'm afab), I'm going to change my name once I do research, and I want to bind. They told me they supported me no matter what, which is a very welcome change from my old experiences, after all of this I decided that I would ask my mom to help me cut my hair short and I would do everything else myself. 

I brought up the subject and she immediately shut me down saying I was her baby girl and she loves my long hair (which is only long because of quarantine, I usually keep it in the shortest bob possible) and later when I mentioned it she went into another rant about how our family friend got bullied for being openly gay in high school and the same was going to happen to me if I cut my hair short. So I'm now really scared to come out to her, she was really accepting when I first came out but she is exactly the kind of person to deadname me to get something that she wants or refuse to use my pronouns and chosen name because it's not the one she gave me. I'm not really sure what to do and I can't buy a binder without her help because of covid and I can't change my name without coming out to people. All of this uncertainty and realizing that I don't have that much dysphoria is giving me major imposter syndrome too. 

So that brings me to why I'm posting here. I would like to know if anyone has been in this situation and/or has tips of how to feel less like you're making this all up or have ways of feeling more androgynous in ways that won't tip anyone off or that my parents might allow? This is kind of long so I appreciate anyone who has read this entire thing, any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you so so much. Have a wonderful day!

I'm not really sure what to do and I can't buy a binder without her help because of covid and I can't change my name without coming out to people. All of this uncertainty and realizing that I don't have that much dysphoria is giving me major imposter syndrome too. \n\nSo that brings me to why I'm posting here. I would like to know if anyone has been in this situation and/or has tips of how to feel less like you're making this all up or have ways of feeling more androgynous in ways that won't tip anyone off or that my parents might allow? This is kind of long so I appreciate anyone who has read this entire thing, any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you so so much.

2020-08-31 01:55:46,ijp9yd,9,1,"Hi! I'm posting this here because I need advice from other trans folks with an outside perspective on a situation I'm going through. I hope it'd ok to post here.

You see, I'm a non-binary, transmasc person. I started hrt 3 months ago. Passing still takes lots of effort. The thing is, 5 months ago, I started dating this cis guy. He had been my friend since middle school and I considered a good guy. Very woke. Talked often about trans issues and all of that. Anyway, he had had a crush on me since forever and this year I decided to give him a chance.

I found it strange that he was attracted to me. For all the time I had known him, 5+ years, he had only expressed interest in women and identified as straight. I asked about his sexuality and thus he told me that for the past year or so he had only felt attracted to non-binary people and thus he considered himself skoliosexual. Huge red flag, I know. A cis guy talking about how he only likes non-binary people. Plus, that label is kind off controversial (enby loving enbys often prefer ceterosexual). Anyway, I ignored this red flag even when he told be that basically all the non binary in people he had been attracted to were AFAB. 

Fast forward, and I start to notice some stuff. He was very, very excited about me starting HRT. He told me, more than once, that he was curious to know what it would do to my sex drive (?). And once when I was at his house, we were planning to get intimate and he straight up asked me if I would be ok wearing a dress for him. It sounded like he had thought about it for quite a lot of time, you know? Even saying he could go to the store and get me one. This freaked me out, I won't lie. I told him no and broke up with him a week later for a separate issue, but we decided to remain friends. This was like four months ago.

But recently he did something that really pissed me off. He just straight up sent me a message asking about how does my skin feels like now that I'm on T (???), no hi, no how are you. Just a cis dude weirdly interested in my transition. This, along with everything else, has led me to think he may be a fucking chaser. I mean, he never said ""I like girls and transmasc folks as long as they have a you know what"" but that's the vibe I'm getting. And I don't know if my suspicions are correct. Are my conclusions based on nothing? Because I don't know what to think anymore. And also, he's currently courting a trans guy I know. Should I tell him something?

Hey! First of all, sorry if this isn't the right place to be posting this, but I'd like to have some insight.

So, I'm starting to write a little book, and the main character is non binary and bisexual. I'm trans myself but I'd like to know what would be a good representation on this manner? How to present the character as non binary? There's a part (it's a very first draft and translated, not good I know) that's like:


""-Oh, yeah, my dad talks about you. Angelica?

-Mhm. You're Julie, right?

-No, my name is Alex. I changed it when I found out I was non binary a few months ago. I go by they/them pronouns too. Guess not everyone found out though. 

-Oh, cool. And you don't need to explain yourself.""


What do you think? I would like it if I didn't put their deadname on it, but I think it's gonna appear some more times (with their mom) in the future. Although the book is not about them being non binary, it's a coming of age/new adult kinda thing, I think I'll write about it a bit.

2020-08-31 22:54:32,ik8kr8,3,1,"I can share a bit of my thinking here, and would love to hear anyone else’s thoughts/experiences.

I’ve felt “trans” (ftm) for over a decade at this point, but for various reasons decided not to socially or medically transition. Mostly bc it just seems intense and I don’t think I would be satisfied with the results. Plus I have very gender fluid fashion moods that are just easier to accommodate as AFAB. Every so often my dysphoria gets p bad though. 
It’s mostly over things like voice and muscle mass. Of course also height and hip/shoulder ratio but I can’t change the latter even with hormones..
So.
I recently discovered the concept of microdosing hormones, and I’m really intrigued by the idea that I could kind of slowly change secondary sex characteristics and stop if I felt like it/felt “masculine enough” after a certain point. Namely the voice drop is what I’d be after since even after stopping T it wouldn’t revert.
I don’t feel like socially transitioning is a good option for me right now (if ever).
What are your thoughts on just kind of being perceived as a masculine woman in society? Has anyone done this either mtf direction or ftm direction (living professionally as a masculine woman or feminine man and then like in personal life having people know full extent of gender identity)?
Any other thoughts or anecdotes much appreciated.
