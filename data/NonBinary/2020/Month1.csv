2020-01-01 14:11:35,eiip9y,8,1,"Hi y'all,

This is my first post and I'm on mobile, so apologies if the formatting is weird/ I'm doing something wrong.

I just want to talk about a shitty thing that happened to me last night (NYE). I'm nb, afab. I was out with my partner (who is a woman) and some friends. At some point my partner went to the bathroom and didn't come back for ages, so I went looking for her.

When I went into the women's bathroom, I saw some dudes looking at me and talking to each other, which I didn't give much thought - people often think I'm a guy and point out that I'm going into the ""wrong"" bathroom. My partner was in the bathroom chatting with some woman, so I waited to catch her eye. As I was waiting, one of the guys I had seen looking at me opened the door to the bathroom, grabbed me by the arm and tried to drag me out of the bathroom, saying ""alright, mate, time for you to leave, you're in the ladies' toilet"" in a really aggressive voice. The other guys were standing behind him, glaring at me. I wasn't sure if they were trying to kick me out of the pub, beat me up, or what. Everyone was drunk and they clearly thought I was a man who went into the women's bathroom for some nefarious purpose, so I felt kinda threatened and said the only thing I could think of so that they would leave me alone: ""I am a woman"".

The good thing is that it worked, they apologized, and left me alone, but it felt terrible to misgender myself and deny my own identity just so they would leave me alone. This was in rural Cornwall, everyone was drunk af, and it definitely wasn't a situation in which I could have explained my nb identity. I guess I could have said something like ""I'm just checking on my gf"" or something, but I was scared and just didn't want to get beaten up.

2020-01-01 17:50:19,eil668,1,1,"So my favorite band, Steam Powered Giraffe, recently dropped a new single written their transgender member, Bunny Bennett.  It's called Transform and you can see the music video here:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRdkV208W80](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRdkV208W80)   


It's a wonderful song written by trans people for trans people, and it's clear the artist poured her heart and soul into it.  But after listening to it several times over, it just hit me that, as an Enby,  I will never be able to transition to the body I want and that I will never be accepted for who and what I am outside of some internet strangers in places that are designed for us.

Then my pychilogist, help me understand more about me, so basically, my nature is, if i go full guy mode for 30 years i will get depressed and confused about gender, then if I go full girl mode, it could happen the same. 

So then the term androgynous started popping, and i think it describes me, and my facial features help with that, i can get misgendered when i shave my beard, and i like it and maybe hate it too? I live my life as a man, im so used to do that, even when i told my mom that im trans she did not believe me, not because she is not supportive, but because i was so “manly”, i have daughters, and it is difficult for me to be less manly, they know i was going to transition, but i guess i do a good job trying to be a “man”.

So as andro is a term for fashion i think bigender and NB, are something i can fit, then, after all the confusión i started to hate labels, so i can just say im human.

I was scared enough of going outside as a woman, now just imagine a ""man"" who ""looks like a woman"". \n\nMy ethnicity -- afro-latino American -- also adds to my anxiety.

Now, when a patient comes to a clinic for the first time, it's standard procedure to ask that patient a number of questions (e.g., what's your diet like? Do you feel safe in your neighborhood? Do you text and drive?). 

Eventually, we arrive at the sexual history of the patient. As medical students, we are taught to ask the following:

Have you been sexually active within the last year? If so, with men, women, or both?

My question is, might there be a better way to ask this question (men, women, or both?)? This is how we are taught to ask the question; however, I was wondering if there might be a more inclusive way to ask.

I dont know where to start. I am thinking about buying a baseball cap, maybe other hats as well, and some bow ties, and throwing those into my usual rotation of clothes to sort of mix things up a bit. But what else? 

I like my breasts so I dont want to wear a binder. I have shaved sides and medium length hair, and I feel like that suits me well in being neither masculine or feminine for the most part. 

Also, I havent changed my pronouns yet, but I am thinking about it.

so, semi-positivity first. I just bought my first actual GC2B binder, with my own money, and I can expect to have it in a minimum of about two days. yay, me! but just like when I got my shitty Amazon binder off a friend of a friend of a friend, I’m suddenly hit with this overwhelming feeling of “oh my god, transitioning is a thing I can do outside of my imagination???” and it’s just so much that it’s making me nervous. but, hopefully it’ll arrive in good condition, and it’ll fit. so I have that to look forward to beyond everything else that’s dragging me down. 😌

now onto the big bad. I’m beginning to have a much harder time embracing my nonbinary identity, and presently it’s not regular flavored transphobes I have to blame for once. if you’d like me to go into specifics I like the terms transmasc and androgyne but according to the LGBT spaces I’ve encountered more and more of online,  androgyne is ACTUALLY (/s) a “”special snowflake term”” and it’s acceptable to shame me for using it 🤨 doesn’t matter that the word’s been around for ages. apparently I make the community look like a joke by using the word. sure I might not actually be out as androgyne specifically, bUt iM sTiLL a JoKe bcus logic 😌

also, apparently it’s acceptable to be “enby skeptics” which basically just amounts to someone not believing being nonbinary is possible (because...something about brain structure and how it relates to gender?? who in blue hell actually goes as far as checking brain structure of all things when it comes to gender stuff...anyway.) but still pretending to respect nonbinary people for those sweet, sweet woke points. there are so so many of those people floating around (some of them even go to my school! it’s so fun! /s) and it’s honestly got me worried. especially because a lot of them seem to be eighteen or younger and are super quick to dismiss the words and experiences shared by older nonbinary people. maybe they’ll grow out of it, maybe not...but more and more people are speaking out about their “nonbinary skepticism” and it’s. bad.

does anyone else have experiences in dealing with these sorts of people?? they’re like regular transphobes but Big Brained and Woke(TM) /s and it’s getting on my nerves because I don’t know how to deal. I have a small circle of people who look up to me on Instagram specifically where that crap seems to be the most heavily concentrated and it’s getting stressful having to stay strong through the onslaught of people bitching to me about how I’m oh so clearly faking my identity for oppression points. advice on coping is appreciated, or even just sharing experiences w these sorts of people. I’d like some reassurance that I’m not alone in dealing with this fuckery in the one place I’m supposed to feel supported when real life falls through.  I want to be a good role model and an inspiration to fellow LGBTQ people but now I’m questioning whether or not I should even let myself be visible at all...

tl;dr: enby skeptics r annoying as hell and even with small things to help affirm my gender it’s getting hard to stay positive at the moment ://",NonBinary,“nonbinary skepticism” is destroying my well-being.

I just bought my first actual GC2B binder, with my own money, and I can expect to have it in a minimum of about two days. yay, me! but just like when I got my shitty Amazon binder off a friend of a friend of a friend, I’m suddenly hit with this overwhelming feeling of “oh my god, transitioning is a thing I can do outside of my imagination???” and it’s just so much that it’s making me nervous. but, hopefully it’ll arrive in good condition, and it’ll fit. so I have that to look forward to beyond everything else that’s dragging me down. 😌\n\nnow onto the big bad. I’m beginning to have a much harder time embracing my nonbinary identity, and presently it’s not regular flavored transphobes I have to blame for once. if you’d like me to go into specifics I like the terms transmasc and androgyne but according to the LGBT spaces I’ve encountered more and more of online,  androgyne is ACTUALLY (/s) a “”special snowflake term”” and it’s acceptable to shame me for using it 🤨 doesn’t matter that the word’s been around for ages. apparently I make the community look like a joke by using the word. sure I might not actually be out as androgyne specifically, bUt iM sTiLL a JoKe bcus logic 😌\n\nalso, apparently it’s acceptable to be “enby skeptics” which basically just amounts to someone not believing being nonbinary is possible (because...something about brain structure and how it relates to gender?? who in blue hell actually goes as far as checking brain structure of all things when it comes to gender stuff...anyway.) but still pretending to respect nonbinary people for those sweet, sweet woke points. there are so so many of those people floating around (some of them even go to my school! it’s so fun! /s) and it’s honestly got me worried. especially because a lot of them seem to be eighteen or younger and are super quick to dismiss the words and experiences shared by older nonbinary people. maybe they’ll grow out of it, maybe not...but more and more people are speaking out about their “nonbinary skepticism” and it’s. bad.\n\ndoes anyone else have experiences in dealing with these sorts of people?? they’re like regular transphobes but Big Brained and Woke(TM) /s and it’s getting on my nerves because I don’t know how to deal. I have a small circle of people who look up to me on Instagram specifically where that crap seems to be the most heavily concentrated and it’s getting stressful having to stay strong through the onslaught of people bitching to me about how I’m oh so clearly faking my identity for oppression points. advice on coping is appreciated, or even just sharing experiences w these sorts of people. I’d like some reassurance that I’m not alone in dealing with this fuckery in the one place I’m supposed to feel supported when real life falls through.  I want to be a good role model and an inspiration to fellow LGBTQ people but now I’m questioning whether or not I should even let myself be visible at all...\n\ntl;dr: enby skeptics r annoying as hell and even with small things to help affirm my gender it’s getting hard to stay positive at the moment ://', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': '“nonbinary skepticism” is destroying my well-being.

TLDR: I don't think I can ever come out to some people that mean world to me and I don't know how to cope with it.

This may get long so strap in.
I have four incredibly close friends. These people mean everything to me and I even have a part of one of my tattoos dedicated to them. Two of them know about me being nonbinary while the other two do not. We'll call the two that do know P and L and the two that don't T and K. T and K don't understand transgender people but have never been unsupportive of them if that makes sense? They don't understand how you could be born one way but are actually another but they say ""Live life as you please don't let me get in your way."" I appreciate that they do that instead of being transphobic and horrible. Either way they have made one or two off hand remarks about how being nonbinary is made up and something people do to look special. 

The thing is they are incredibly kind people and this is the only flaw that they have. They care a lot about me and I know this because of how supportive they are in every other aspect of my life. I worry so much that they will make fun of me if they ever found out about my gender, or lack thereof. Ultimately, I do not feel as though I can ever come out to them. I want to keep them in my life for always, but I do worry one day I will be accidentally outed by someone that does know and our friendship will come crashing down.

Testosterone is so permanent. I worry I might regret it. I also worry that it'll negatively effect my health.

But then one of the kids turns around and makes eye contact with me and I think, ""Oh shit, I know exactly what\'s about to happen."" And, oh boy, it does.\n\nThis kid looks up at me and asks, ""Are you a boy or a girl?"" I\'m non-binary (shocker) and I don\'t want to explain the nuance of my gender identity to any stranger, regardless of age or intent, in a queue at a supermarket. Plus uhh I\'m still figuring it out, and it\'s been on my mind a lot lately, but that\'s another story. I didn\'t know what to say, so I said nothing. So this kid asks again, ""Are you a boy or a girl?"" to which I quietly reply, ""Does it matter?"" It felt bad. The kid asked again once more before the guardian called for the kid to leave.\n\nSo, I have a question for you all: have you been in this situation? How did you reply? How would you reply if this happened to you? Thanks folx.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': '""Are you a boy or a girl?""', 'created': 1578119003.0}"

It's been a weird experience, these last few weeks, both as I've accepted myself that I'm nonbinary, and had to readjust to closeted life. Last time I spent a good few months knowingly in the closet as bi, later to come out as gay, and that was absolutely terrifying thinking of what my parents would think. I'd have hoped that the fears wouldn't return second/third time round, but they keep creeping up on me.

Maybe it's because gender expression is quite different to sexuality. Maybe it's because I've never discussed nonbinary genders with either parent and am unsure on opinions. Maybe it's the dysphoria messing with my brain. Maybe I'm being a paranoid gay idiot. Who knows. Hopefully I can look back at this in 24 hours and chuckle slightly at how misplaced my fears were.

Of course, I have known for years that I didn't quite identify as a cis woman.

My most euphoric moment was when I decided to get an undercut, I've never looked back since!

Last December was when all the pieces finally clicked together. I realized I didn't feel comfortable with ""just"" being a woman, but that I didn't want to be the opposite either. That all (or most) of my insecurities about my body, were actually dysphoria. That that one time I wore a beard for a day, and people were confused about my gender, was one of the best days of my life (and that I still think about that a lot).

And this subreddit also played a big role in it, because when I read the posts and saw the images, I recognized so much of what I was feeling!

2020-01-05 01:14:05,ek5q9d,4,5,"Hello, all. I'm new here, though I've been lurking around for months. (It's been quite a help. &lt;3)

Long story short: after spending a good year questioning through everything, two months I finally calmed myself enough to say, hey, I may not be able to pin myself to any of the identities I see floating around, but I know I'm nonbinary. For now, that's enough. Even the labels that carve out space for the incomprehensible WHATEVER I experience just don't seem to work for me, but I'm not torn up about it. I know who I am. 

And so my question is this: is there anyone else who, like me, can't seem to decide what set of pronouns they'd like to use? In my case I'm torn between she/her and they/them. Committing to one set feels like ignoring a truth about myself that I know is there, but the problem is that I can very rarely even decipher which set I'd prefer. It would be one thing if I woke up and Knew, you know? But I don't. And for that reason, she/they becomes a puzzle, too. My gender feelings float around, but only occasionally do I have a strong inclination one way or the other. I'm not out to very many people just yet, and so 99.99% of the people I know still use she/her pronouns for me, which is *fine,* but if I go ahead and announce that my pronouns are she/they... what can I expect? Do I leave it for others to decide? Is it my job to let others know how I'm feeling on any particular day? I don't know if I *can.* But looking at my social media profiles, which still have she/her written in the bios, makes me feel wrong. I know that nonbinary people can use any pronouns, including those they were assigned at birth, but it still feels like a lie.

Sometimes I wonder if slipping exclusively to they/them wouldn't just be easier, but I truly don't mind it when others use she for me and honestly, passing as a girl doesn't bother me when it comes to people who don't matter. Strangers, etc. I present 'femininely' enough that at most I come across as not straight, which is true too. And there's just *something* about she/her pronouns that keeps me from throwing them out the window altogether. Familiarity, some innate connection, who knows. I don't know what it is, let alone how I'll feel about it in a year, or in five years.

Thanks in advance for any replies, as I know this got long. You are all brilliant people whose brave, unapologetic authenticity has brought me a lot of comfort and hope. &lt;3

2020-01-05 04:39:00,ek857t,8,3,"Hey everyone,

I was a little upset the other day because my long distance friend and I were on the phone and his family were asking about me, and one of them said “wait, boy or girl?”. He did try at first to explain a bit about being nonbinary, to his credit, but I ended up saying it was alright if he just said I was male for ease. I did it because he himself doesn’t know loads about it and he seemed uncomfortable, but he was trying and I felt bad for him.

I’m going to visit later on this year and he brought it up again, alone this time, and half-jokingly said I’d have to either pick one or explain to his family myself when I was there. That annoyed me a bit at the time but he’s always been a good mate aside from that so I just moved on from it.

Thing is, I get the feeling this is something they’ve never come across, and his father in particular is a very medical and scientific man. I feel like they would find my usual “I just don’t feel comfortable with either label” unsatisfactory, but I also don’t want to bore them with intricate discussion.

2020-01-05 22:38:32,ekk8pr,0,1,"hi! for context here, i'm 20, AFAB, on pill birth control for 3ish years, and i live in Maryland. for unrelated reasons to my gender, i recently was tested for PCOS and the lab results showed that my natural hormones are within optimal, expected range. the reason i had that test was bc my period is hella irregular and i already have intense, dark facial hair; i'm Armenian on my dad's side and our AFAB people do often have dark body hair, so i figure that's my situation. i'm swapping birth controls to see if that will regulate my period. i identify as neither male nor female most of the time, but my gender fluctuates and often i feel like a femboy, so i like the idea of presenting as someone who's physically both androgynous and a little masculine but feminine in mannerisms and dress. i prefer they/them but i like he/him sometimes, and i can't stand she/her. i don't want to be seen as a highly feminine woman at all, that makes me hella uncomfy, but excellent in certain situations, i don't want to be seen as a feminine man either. i'm neither of those things, hence non binary.

in MD, my goals for transitioning from F to non binary are promising at least legally/on paper. i'm going to change my driver's license, birth certificate, SS card, etc, to update my name and change my gender where i can (not sure if SS cards allow options other than M or F in which case i'll change it to M bc that's better than staying F). 

but in terms of medically transitioning, what i've read online is very binary oriented. i am unsure if i want top surgery, but i know for certain that i do want bottom surgery and i don't want HRT bc i want to have children later in life. i don't know where the hell i can go that will do this for me. like, John's Hopkins' department for gender affirmation requires AFAB trans people be on HRT for a certain period of time before they will be considered for bottom surgery. what i have seen that's specifically for non binary trans people has primarily been HRT and too surgery. 

i don't want to have hysto or a vaginectomy at all, i'm not dysphoric about my front hole or my period, i want at the very least metoidoplasty and maybe later phallo. idk about my chest either, and again HRT bc i want to be able to carry my own child and nurse them, so maybe I'll just have a reduction in the future and bind/disguise my figure with baggy clothes. my biggest dysphoria comes from having a clitoris and actually from my thick facial hair. 

if i have to go out of state for bottom surgery, i'm okay with that, i can wait until i've saved up the money. i can also deal with waxing/plucking my facial hair for now. i saw another post here mention a drug they took along with T that reduced their facial hair (Finasteride), and that sounds like a miracle honestly. would microdosing with T make me more androgynous without risking my fertility? are there any routes of HRT that don't compromise fertility?

if anyone can help me find clinics/doctors that won't require or pressure me to stick to binary options, i would be so grateful.

I originally came out as a trans guy because i didn't think that nonbinary people were really a thing (sorry i know, i was very ignorant). But at this point, i've tried being a cis woman and i've tried being a trans guy and both have felt incomplete. Yet, i still can't get over this idea that i'm a trans guy in denial or that i'm not really trans if i start identifying as nonbinary. As if at that point i'm ""basically a woman"". On the other hand, i do sometimes feel like a woman. Just not in a cis way. But i feel stupid staying that because i'm afab. I've had top surgery &amp; i definitely feel like i should have been born with a dick. But tbh i feel more like a transfemme enby since i feel more neutral/woman socially but want to be amab. 

&amp;nbsp; 

I know someone people describe themselves as nonbinary women. And some afab nonbinary people use she/they. I guess is just comes down to feeling ""basically cis"" because of my social dysphoria or ""a trans guy in denial"" because of my physical dysphoria. And also feeling embarrassed because i feel like everyone is judging me for not being able to make up my mind on my gender.

2.3 years ago I realized the obvious fact that I was trans and started planing on how I'll get to transition, skip 2 years later and for the last 5 weeks I've been on Estrogen.

So basically I want to look like a girl and wear feminine clothes that look good on me, but I don't want to feel like one, or be referred to as one but also sometimes I want to be more androgynous or even a bit masculine, I also don't like reffering myself as girl or a guy and I don't mind being reffered to as they.

So, I, (AFAB, 18), have been struggling with severe dysphoria, especially regarding my (trigger warning) monthly cycle and organs associated with it for a very long time. 

Over the course of last year, my dysphoria completely ramped up by so much; It was completely destroying me and my mental health. With that, and alongside other problems, I turned to drugs and alcohol and completely shut myself off. I was having an extremely hard time, and no one seemed to noticed, which only fueled my reckless behavior. 

In moments of clarity I researched what I could do to help myself. Unfortunately, with it being the South, my options are limited. However, I found that hormonal birth control, (despite the estrogen, sadly), could be for me, quite literally, a life saver. My parents were definitely not keen on the idea, automatically associating birth control with sex. There's nothing wrong with sex obviously, but parents will be parents. 

In reality, I just need it to control the monthly thing, and hopefully even stop it. It will also help the severe depression I get 2 weeks out if the month because of it. 

I waited for awhile, sinking deeper into my hole. I made some posts on Reddit, trying to figure out what to do. 

My mom called me one day from her work and said she was kicking me out this summer no matter what. (This is a whole other story....) Which made me realize, shit, I'm an adult!! And I went to a reputable online source that delivers birth control straight to your door. They even accepted my insurance. Me, being extremely cocky at the time, decided to deliver it straight to my house, not to a friend's or anything to about conflict with my parents. A decision I am now regretting since the package gets here TODAY. 

I sent my mom a text explaining to her what the delivery will be a couple minutes ago, since most likely her or my dad will be home when it gets here. She usually responds pretty fast, but since she hasn't yet, most likely she's seen it and is fuming. 

I am preparing myself for the brutal onslaught that will be coming for me tonight. 

I can't live my life satisfying other people's beliefs and wants anymore. 

I ordered birth control. And today, I'm ordering a binder. I can't closet myself anymore, I'm making myself miserable. I graduate highschool this year, I deserve to be comfortable and happy with myself!

Ok so I’m ridiculous and I talked to my boyfriend about being non-binary but I told him it was a dream so it would stay hypothetical. It actually worked and I’m so happy for that but I’m sure he wouldn’t be surprised if I came out anytime soon.  So anyway I basically told him what I would be like except it was “what I was like in the dream” and lucky for me he would still think of me the same and still love me. The thing he was iffy about was if I dressed hardcore male and he thought the concept of a binder was weird. (Understandable for a straight guy). He was also iffy about having a new name as he said he likes my name now. I didn’t tell him what it would be cause I mean if It was hypothetical why would I already have a new name picked out.  The pronouns he was ok with which all this gives me hope.  

Honestly I think there is more surprise to my parents that I was a regular old girl than if I told them I was non-binary. I went thought a stage in 7th-8th grade where I literally only wore basketball shorts and plain t-shirts so I’m sure my mom was expecting me to come out as lesbian or something. Not to mention I’ve had my hair short since 7th grade. So basically everywhere I went I was called he/him by other people. I also think the iffy part for my parents is a new name, since obviously they are the ones who picked my birthname.

Also what about school sports? I’m not legally anything but a female so do I continue playing women’s soccer women’s volleyball? How does that work?

And also what if I do come out but I end up not liking how I feel about it and I wanna go back to my birth name and she/her. Would it be weird if I just told everyone to call me that again?

2020-01-07 23:33:50,eljuja,2,1,"This post is long, has a lot to do with internalized enby-phobia, and doesn't really go anywhere. 

My mom was shopping for a wig today, and walking through the rows, I fell in love with the idea of just being able to try a new hairstyle for a day without needing the 3-6 week commitment of a sew-in (I've only ever gotten two weaves installed, and both times, after a week or two, they contributed to discomfort with my gender and made me want to rip them out). 

My natural hair isn't particularly short — it's medium length for kinky-curly hair — and I'm two months into trying to deadlock it because mom won't let me cut it, but locs are a nice, unisex style I can live with. So, with all that context, I bought a sort of curly, mid-back length wig today on something of a whim. Sure, I tried it on at the store, and I asked for opinions, and I thought I'd like it better when I got home and styled it for myself and whatnot. So I did that, and put it on at home, and I felt like a different person, alright. Like a drag queen or something.

I bind my chest pretty much everyday I leave the house, wear boxers anytime I'm not on shark week, shop primarily in the men's section, etc. I don't do these things arbitrarily, or because it's what I _think_ being NB looks like or means for an Afab person; I do them because the majority of the time, anything else makes me feel incomplete, or like I'm pretending to be someone I'm not. I _am_ this person, and I'd really come to terms with it after I manged to get my first proper binder in October with the help of a friend. I gave myself permission to be me, and be masc without feeling _held_ to it. 

I'm sure my mom, who doesn't know I'm NB (probably doesn't know what that is, either), thinks my teenage identity crisis consists of a tomboy phase (she doesn't know the _half_ of it), but it's been a long time coming and many years in the making, so it's not like I suddenly changed from seeming to be a girly girl to dressing like a stud most of the time in a week. 

I don't really know why I bought the wig. I actually really like how my locs are coming in. I'm starting to look at myself in the mirror without misgendering myself. I'm feeling like NB is an okay thing to be.

Back to the wig. I put it on, I fixed it up, and immediately felt like I'd made a mistake. It doesn't 'fit' the way I dress, but dressing in the way that makes it not look out of place makes me feel like a total stranger (plus most of my fem clothing puts my binder straps on display, and the binder is basically non-negotiable because seeing my chest makes me very uncomfortable). Which is why I compared it to being a drag queen, or maybe a cosplayer. I don't feel like I'm just a person making a change of pace, I feel like I'm putting on performance art, and I told myself I was done doing that. But I don't _hate_ it; it just doesn't feel like _me_. It feels like a different person, which I'm kinda okay with. 

On the bright side, its just a wig, and I can take it off in a moment, so I don't have to wear it any longer or more than I'd want to. On the other hand, I absolutely don't feel confident in my identity when I put it on, and I don't know if it's because I feel like I'm not NB enough (which is a problem with how I _think_ about what I'm doing) or if it's because I'm doing something that's genuinely odds with how I feel about myself (which is a problem with bad gender feels and me not understanding them as well as well as I thought I did).

Also, now that I bought the damn thing, to not wear it seems like a waste. I sorta bought it with my allowance, but even then, I'm stingy and feel like the money I put in should equal the use I get out of something lmao. It's a wig — it's not like I can return it, and the style isn't something my mom would wear. 

I'm probably making too big a deal out of this, but I just needed to complain about it for a bit. The balance of validating/invalidating myself (touchy terminology, but I haven't really found any better words yet) is precarious, and I'm generally teetering on the edge of sending myself down a spiral of “Why am I like this?” that I'm trying to avoid.",NonBinary,Afab and bought a wig; I think I made a $50 dollar mistake,1578465230.0,"{'created_utc': 1578440030, 'id': 'eljuja', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""This post is long, has a lot to do with internalized enby-phobia, and doesn't really go anywhere. \n\nMy mom was shopping for a wig today, and walking through the rows, I fell in love with the idea of just being able to try a new hairstyle for a day without needing the 3-6 week commitment of a sew-in (I've only ever gotten two weaves installed, and both times, after a week or two, they contributed to discomfort with my gender and made me want to rip them out). \n\nMy natural hair isn't particularly short — it's medium length for kinky-curly hair — and I'm two months into trying to deadlock it because mom won't let me cut it, but locs are a nice, unisex style I can live with.

Most of the folx at the party were well aware of my NB status, and were even misgendering me before anyone even really started drinking.

That made me real mad. So I tapped into Righteous Enby Fury™️, and came out on social media in spectacular dramatic flair.

In said post, I repeatedly said, ""repeated occurrences and I'm blocking people."" Esp re: transphobic or enby-phobic commentary or content. Or if people just plain don't respect my identity.

I was on Twitter and I saw someone comment on a post not at all related to trans or lgbtq+ issues whatsoever about how they convinced their ""daughter"" that they weren't a boy and had therapists and such to help them get over it and not support it as a possibility. Someone then commented to that saying their ""niece"" wanted to be a boy and thus became their nephew but with therapy and time they were able to ""make her detransition before she did anything medical"". 

This hit me because while I don't have a story exactly like this it reminded me of what happened to me. I came out as a trans and a lack of support forced me back into the closet. 

For me I was 15 when I came out I believe. I had felt uncomfortable with being female and seen as a girl for as long as I can remember. When I was really little I could just be whoever I wanted and I liked the fluidity of it. I'm my father's only child and he always had me work with him on things and never forced me into any gender role. To him I basically acted as a son in the stereotypical sense that I would build things with him and help him with everything. All of this was good until I hit puberty. Sorry if I get extra hard to understand I'm getting emotional but I know I need to talk about this eventually.

I remember the first time my mom made me wear a bra and it is the most perfect example of my dysphoria at the time. It was the most uncomfortable triangle bra that dug into my sides and shoulders. I wore it for the first time when I went with my dad to the manual car wash and I just cried and begged him to let me take it off but he knew my mom would be upset if I did. This marked the beginning of me being seen and identified more forwardly as female. Puberty robbed me of my fluidity and my mom wanted more and more for me to be feminine. My first victory was when I started wearing sports bras exclusively for a time until she made me get regular bras as well. They were so much more comfortable physically and mentally for me and it made me have to pay less attention to that area.

I kind of bounced between giving in and trying to be feminine and not caring for awhile. Middle school was when I learned a bit about trans people and was immediately drawn to trans guys and thought that had to be me. I watched FTMTranstastic religiously and just wished I could be like them. I didn't understand non-binary people much at this point, I was aware of gender-fluid as an identity but I didn't identify with it at all. So I figured I must be a boy. So eventually I worked up the courage to tell my dad. My dad was so.fucking.amazing. There was not an ounce of denial or lack of acceptance. I was scared to tell my mom though. Her boyfriend isn't very accepting and around this time was when Caitlyn had come out so hearing comments about her really made me not feel like coming out was safe or I'd be accepted in that home. My dad actually came out for me after offering, so I don't know what exactly my mom said. All I know is the sentiment that was given to me then and for awhile.

""I'll always love and accept you, but I'm not calling you different names/pronouns.""

The almost immediate shove of me never talking about being trans again started. It stopped being talked about in therapy, my dad would sometimes go to my sessions with me and would refer to me as he/him. This eventually stopped because I was so scared of my mom. She has always been very emotionally and verbally abusive but I was so scared of losing her because I came out. She never talked about it, until one day she gave me a bunch of books by and about trans people. How the hell was I suppose to view that? She didn't say anything with it. But it sure as hell made me more confused. 

Eventually my transness didn't exist. It didn't happen. No one talks about it. There's an odd feeling in the air when trans topics are talked about on tv, like people remember when I thought I was one of them. Usually it's not talked about at all, but sometimes my mom hits with something out of nowhere to remind me who I am to her. 

I remember when that Google art app came out where you would take a photo and it would compare you to works of art, I would always get guys and girls. I showed my mom once and said something like, ""I'm either a cherub or a hot guy, I guess that's what I am."" And so stern she just replied,

""You are NOT a boy.""

That still rings in my head. Even though I shortly after coming out as trans learned about being non-binary, so I don't really see myself as a guy anymore, I still think about that. Like even if I mistakenly get a little confident in my identity she'll just remind me I'm not. It's not real. And it really, really sucks. Particularly because it's taken me so long to feel a part of the community again. I feel that since I wasn't passionate and vocal about my identity that maybe I'm not ""trans enough"". Maybe I'm weak. I'm trying really hard to get over these feelings but it's hard. 

I don't know if any of this made sense but I just wonder how many other people were forced back in the closet and their family just assumes it was a phase or they were fixed. I remember hearing people talk about the gender dysphoria diagnosis and the mention of continually saying they felt that way. I wasn't able to do that and it made and makes me feel again like maybe I'm not actually trans enough.

I’m sorry that being me makes others upset. Heck I’m sorry that it makes ME upset. Now I feel like i have to come out to my parents before I’m outed to them, too. I wasn’t ready. I’m still in my egg. I don’t know what i am or what I’m going to be. I was hoping to either 1) not have to come out if this questioning amounts to nothing or 2) come out only once, either as NB or trans man.

My brother knows, my close friends know, and I have it plastered all over my social media, but I’m not super close with much of my family and they aren’t aware yet, as far as I know.

As I stated earlier, we’re not super close, and there’s always been this emotional barrier between us that I can’t seem to break. I was kind of shocked when, during a long car ride, we started talking politics and she expressed some rather conservative opinions. I brought up LGBTQ+ rights, and she seemed rather put off by the broader community; she’s cool with gay marriage, and she knows my sister is bi and doesn’t take issue with it, but I could tell that beyond that was where she had “drawn the line” (for lack of a better phrase). 

She admitted to watching Ben Shapiro, ranted about how we shouldn’t be expected to change driver’s licenses for gender identities, and explicitly stated that she “doesn’t get” they/them pronouns.

2020-01-09 18:35:14,emdtkj,5,1,"Name dysphoria was never a thing for me until lately. Not feeling it was part of how I justified not being ""trans enough"" to transition. Ironically, my transitioning is what's catalyzed name dysphoria for me now. Specifically, it's the tiny but quickly growing part of my experience in which I pass as female until I give my name or G\*d forbid have to show ID. 

It's not that my name is 100% masc. It's not. Maybe 90%. Cis women can rock it with only minor trouble. But I'm not a cis woman. The moment my name comes up, any hope of being gendered appropriately (which for me is either female or just not gendered at all because they're too polite to ask questions and don't know what to do with me) goes up in smoke, and I get stuck in a really shit-on corner of the man box. To make matters worse, my anxiety skyrockets whether I get any overt misgendering or not. I feel like my names are only safe to share with people who know me already, but those are precisely the people who already know them.

I've always felt like if I wanted to change my name I would start going by my Hebrew name. But I am currently using two different ones. One of them is a clear female name, sounds normal enough as an English name, is similar to my assigned first name, and is also similar to the names of two of my maternal ancestors. The other one is more gender-ambiguous, derived from the name of an archangel who represents the meaning of the more female name. The two are closely related and intended to accompany one another. The gender-ambiguous archangel name is more difficult for English speakers to pronounce. Hell even when calling me to ʿaliyyuh they have a hard time with it not to mention the hopelessness of a nonbinary-gendered mi shebbeyrakh. (Side topic: Do I put away my tallis gudoyl for a while and pull it back out later after the community stops misgendering me?)

To some extent I lean towards having the gender-ambiguous name first in honor of my loud, decolonizing enby side, which is the real me! But I also have the side that panics when they have to show ID, call the landlord to check the furnace, stop for gas on the road or in any way have unplanned interactions in a state where there is no X on licenses. That side would really like to have the female name first and be able to blend in.

Of course I could put either one first and just use the one that's appropriate to any given situation. I don't know that ordering is really what's slowing me down. I'm also ambivalent about changing my name at all. I'm not even thinking about how my mother would receive it. I feel a little resentful about ""having to"" in order to get less trouble due to others' perceived mismatch between my name and my presentation, when internally I don't have any problem with my assigned names.

There's a familiar feeling here. I'm resisting a change because I feel like things are ""fine"" the way they are (with my assigned names). I felt that way before I came out as gay, before I identified as nonbinary, and before I decided to transition publicly. All three times the feeling gradually shifted towards the necessity of change until it reached a point where I felt a sudden existential shift, made a decision, and afterward felt like I'd come out of the shadow and into the light. I can't believe my name might have that kind of potential from where I'm sitting right now, but I might see it clearly in hindsight soon if past experience is a good guide.

Resisting this change out of resentment against ""having to"" due to external pressure is a strategy that may not work for me anymore in particular. Let's face it, external pressure definitely helped me transition publicly and go on hormones, and these are some of the healthiest and most affirming, self-loving decisions of my life. My point of view has always been that my identity is my responsibility but also negotiated in fundamental communication with the outside world and on terms that are never of my own creation. So external pressure matters to me, even when it comes in the form of anxiety-inducing threat, even when it refuses to read my nonbinarity and makes me choose. Names, like bodies, are read binarily by nearly everybody, even when they really are ambiguous. If my most important goal is to not be read male, then I get to help the binary-minded people of the world read me more female I guess.

Tangential PS: They say we can tell we're trans when we assume that gender identity is a normal thing to spend a lot of time and energy thinking about. I think at this point I can satisfactorily say I am non-binary because I just feel like all trans people must be unsure which gender they want to emanate from the name(s) they use, which is obviously not true!

I'm wondering if other amab folk like me, identify with the female autism traits - esp the ""chameleon"" trait ie the a utility to blend/mask enough to get by and be fairly successful but not entirely relaxed.

right now, my partner is nonbinary and trans, and i never really thought a whole lot about gender in relation to me until i met them. and i realized that i literally have no idea? i'm an aquarius, so i have the knowledge that gender is a construct and doesn't mean anything, but i don't necessarily feel any strong pulls towards any kind of label. i just don't know if finding a label for my gender is something that's important for me as an individual? and i was wondering if anyone else has also felt this way, and how to approach it? am i just being an aquarius, or does this mean that i'm not cis? does it really matter when gender is just made up anyway? and i'm in no way trying to say that gender isn't or shouldn't be important to everyone, i understand and respect that having that as a big part of identity for some people is really big. just for me, i don't know if having a gender identity means anything. does that mean i'm nonbinary or maybe agender?",NonBinary,how to know if you're nonbinary or agender?????,1578662528.0,"{'created_utc': 1578637328, 'id': 'emn11y', 'num_comments': 5, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'hi y\'all\n\nso, i don\'t think i ever super thought about gender when i was growing up. i was raised as a girl, but i was more of a ""tomboy"" when i was a kid. idk i was just not really all that interested in stereotypical ""girly"" things, but i wasn\'t all that interested in stereotypical ""boy"" things? i\'m not completely sure, i don\'t have a ton of memories of my childhood.\n\nright now, my partner is nonbinary and trans, and i never really thought a whole lot about gender in relation to me until i met them. and i realized that i literally have no idea? i\'m an aquarius, so i have the knowledge that gender is a construct and doesn\'t mean anything, but i don\'t necessarily feel any strong pulls towards any kind of label. i just don\'t know if finding a label for my gender is something that\'s important for me as an individual? and i was wondering if anyone else has also felt this way, and how to approach it? am i just being an aquarius, or does this mean that i\'m not cis? does it really matter when gender is just made up anyway? and i\'m in no way trying to say that gender isn\'t or shouldn\'t be important to everyone, i understand and respect that having that as a big part of identity for some people is really big. just for me, i don\'t know if having a gender identity means anything. does that mean i\'m nonbinary or maybe agender?', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': ""how to know if you're nonbinary or agender?????"", 'created': 1578662528.0}"

2020-01-10 17:46:22,emueyl,2,1,"Hey y’all! First, context: Since April, I’ve lived out and about as a trans woman. I go by my chosen name now, I’ve social transitioned, it’s great.

But something that has always been on my mind, even for a long time before I publicly came out, is that I don’t feel like I fully identify with other trans women. Like I don’t have a desire to wear skirts, and even though I very much have dealt with dysphoria, I kind of have an ambivalent relationship with my genitalia and don’t have a strong desire to have breasts.

Ive known I wasn't female since I was a kid,  I grew up in a Christan household, so the one time I said that I didn't want to be a girl, I was around 5-7,  my Mom got really angry and said that I was a female because of my anatomy and to never say that again.  I didn't even know that your gender could be different than what you were born with.  I didn't find that out till highschool.  And after I found out..  It made sense, it was who I really was!  It felt natural and amazing! 

It's been eating at me for a long time now..  The other 2 people who know other than my brother are my therapist and my partner.  I was able to talk to my brother privately

My brother basically told me that he doesn't understand how I can't be one or the other.  He said he can accept transgender as mtf or ftm. But not non-binary,  He says he still sees me as a woman and his sister.. But those words hurt even though it was his way of saying that he will always be my brother...  I tried to educate him..  But he's like a brick wall..  

He's a marine,  kind of an asshole..  But I guess...  Since we grew up together (we are 1 year,  1 day and 1 month born apart) I figured out of anyone in my family,  I thought he would understand and accept me..  (I asked him to keep it between us and he said he would,  I trust him)  
And he thinks I should never come out to my mom...  I mean she barely ""accepted"" (and I mean those quotations whole-heartily) of me being pansexual.  ( never wanted to meet my female partners,  didn't want to know if I had a date with a female, see it on my facebook, etc)  

I just feel like I'll never get to be my authentic self with my family.. And that hurts because my family is a loving family, and they say that family is always here for eachother...  IDK..  Now I'm afraid of coming out again for risk of being disowned by them.  
I know my situation isn't the worse that anyone has gone through coming out as non-binary, trans,  gay,  etc... However,  I still don't feel the greatest about the whole situation, I was raised to accept everyone for who and what they are - Agape (unconditional) ]love. It makes me physically ill thinking that this part of me would be an exception to my family

Flash forward to now, one of my colleagues is teaching about sexual orientation and gender.

So I volunteered to speak about my life, experience, and to answer questions.

The talk lasted about an hour. I shared what it was like growing up in the 80s and 90s. What I wish I would have known when I was younger and how I found happiness. I talked about what it was like growing up being different. The emotional cost of having to hide who you are and all of the extra calculations LGBTQ people have to make just to exist in our world. 

I answered a lot of questions about doubt. What to do when you're worried about people not supporting you. How to talk to your parents and advice to give them. How to talk about your friends who are in the LGBTQ community and who's story it is to tell. How to be supportive and what it means to be an ally.

i already feel bad about spamming my insecurities into here. i hope i don't annoy anyone. sorry this is so long.

So i am in my early 20s, considered female all my life. my ""problem"" is, that i am questioning if i really like to be labelled as a cis-woman. i had mostly male friends before the prepubescent divide of elementary school happened and The Boys™  decided i was not cool enough for them. since then i went through being bullied for being weird, not feeling super-duper by being forced to chose Ms or Mr (sometimes did Mr #ironically lol lol lol), an eating disorder that felt ""relieving"" when it made me feel kinda ""gender-/sexless"" (i felt also lifeless. would not recommend. 0/10.), being a closeted heartbroken bisexual\*, hanging out in groups of just guys many times and having that on-off relationship with wearing either make-up or either ""boy/man-clothing""... or both.  also i had my hair cut of 2 years ago and felt good by being told i look like a guy, even if  it was not meant in a nice way specifically. now i have longer hair again, because my insecurities and because i only have money for getting my hair cut twice a year. then i had an undercut were i also could switch my expression better, but i do not favor man buns in general, so it also not felt great. i also do not want to physically transition, even though i had short(!) periods of rather having that other body but i hate having body hair.

my gf came out as mtf trans last year, while always being rather feminine. we talk a lot about this daily. about her transition, about transness, about trans-stars, trans YT-videos. i help her in any way i can, try to comfort her, try to think things through, cutting her hair, making institutional steps etc.. as she's spending all the $$$ for beauty and clothing i kinda switched from my make-up-less man-clothing phase to looking as femme i as i can look. idk why. haha. dressing up together is more fun i guess.

she knows me some years now, saw me and my ""style changes"" (my phases last for 1-7 months usually, so it's not a daily thing). i hate putting labels on me, never felt the label non-binary looks good on me, but as we talk so much about lgbt+ stuff, i told her a few times about my feelings of relating to genderqueer more than cis, maybe even being non-binary. she just was like ""it does not matter as what you label yourself"" or ""i don't know"" or just saying nothing. every time i bring it up i feel like an idiot for even saying it. she says, she loves me acting all macho to her, but with this, she is just pokerfacing me while another time also saying she relates to being inbetween or above genders. i feel like i have no room for myself there. i have no one really to talk to about this but her. i am even to embarrassed to tell my therapist. 

i feel like rejecting every label is the only thing right know that does not feel bad. idk. thanks for reading through. please come at me with tips to handle this. im scared for being attacked as a trender or snowflake or whatever.

I've been identifying as bigender after IDing as ftm. I got on T last spring and loved it....at first. 

What has really gotten to me is the loss of my former singing voice. When it first began dropping it was great, but then it gave me on and off dysphoria when became a BASS after being SOPRANO. I literally could only hit 3 of the notes I used to. 

Fast forward 7 months, it doesn't seem like T is ever going to change my face or body to masculine enough that I can pass as male. I'm getting a bunch of body hair in place I don't want to, and I really dislike male pattern redistribution. I have a bunch of ugly scarring from bad acne and stretch marks from rapid muscle gain, which also disturbs me.

I feel confused and genderfluid. I'm thinking of going cold turkey off T but I'm worried it's going to disturb my mental health and throw me into depression. I'm bipolar and really volatile at the moment mood-wise.

It just seems like every day of having some of these changes is wearing down on me. The voice drop has really been the only permanent change and it's so irreversible. I'm not like r/detrans upset because I don't identify as a cis female but at the same time I feel like a piece of garbage over this. I have no idea the fuck I am and whether I will regret being off T or hate that I ever was.

It doesn't seem T has given me what I wanted, besides an interesting experience. And T has given me a boatload of negative things, including a weak immune system so I get sick easily. I feel like shit and torn in both the male and female directions. I have no idea how to live like this. It doesn't seem like anyone would want to love or date a confused genderfuck like me, and due to the tiny population of people who would, the odds are astronomically low anyone would mesh with me (even friends). 

I can't be either a beautiful woman (especially now with my low voice and wide shoulders thanks to T) or a cute guy (I just don't think I could ever pass without facial surgery, not to mention my bigass hips).

The voice drop has really been the only permanent change and it's so irreversible. I'm not like r/detrans upset because I don't identify as a cis female but at the same time I feel like a piece of garbage over this. I have no idea the fuck I am and whether I will regret being off T or hate that I ever was.\n\nIt doesn't seem T has given me what I wanted, besides an interesting experience. And T has given me a boatload of negative things, including a weak immune system so I get sick easily. I feel like shit and torn in both the male and female directions. I have no idea how to live like this. It doesn't seem like anyone would want to love or date a confused genderfuck like me, and due to the tiny population of people who would, the odds are astronomically low anyone would mesh with me (even friends). \n\nI can't be either a beautiful woman (especially now with my low voice and wide shoulders thanks to T) or a cute guy (I just don't think I could ever pass without facial surgery, not to mention my bigass hips). It feels like I'm in a corner without options and my gender identity makes me confused and unhappy."", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'I definitely felt male and had crippling dysphoria but now I superrrr regret being on T at the moment?

I've read a lot of info about vocal/singing changes for FTM trans people but not much documentation of singing voices for nonbinary people (skip to bottom for questions; read through for contest :) )*

I'm genderqueer(24/she/they) and in a band where I sing vocals and we're planning on recording within the year. Since I'm AFAB and soprano, the notes I'm singing pretty high.

I really want to start doing low dose testosterone and could start within the month if I wanted to. HOWEVER, my band is recording this year either in March or early fall and I'm afraid the vocal changes that come even with low dose t would either **a.)** put my voice out of commission for a few months (I've read that happens to high dose t patients) OR **b.)** eliminate the range that I currently have rendering my unable to sing the parts I've been practicing (highest note I hit is a high G completely in head voice).

I know everyone is different with changes, but it seems that typically, folks on low dose T do have their voices change pretty early. I have heard that with the right exercises it's possible to keep the voice healthy and singing, but I really don't want any curveballs in not being able to sing or having to rewrite all my parts leading up to recording, but I really do want to start T as soon as possible for  y'know, \*gestures vaguely\* mental health. On the flip side I'm wondering if I start low dose T as soon as possible if my voice will be ready to record/possibly rewrite vocal parts within 3-6 months.

1.) Did your voice change on low dose T?   
2.) What was your experience during those changes? Was it fast? Slow? Painful? Easy?  
3.) Did you lose your upper range or did it just expand lower or both ways?  
4.) Was there a period during vocal changes that you lost your singing ability completely? If so how long did that last?

So to understand me. I am 26M but here in the last 3-4 years, I have been questioning my gender. Some reasons why. When I was in preschool I liked dressing up as a girl with a dress and clip-on earrings and heels that were in the dress-up box. I also was bullied as a kid for being gay. And I had ""girl"" friends more than ""boy"" friends. And when middle school happened it was horrible. The bullying got worse. I started to try to date. I was more worried about other things and relationships came and went. My home situation wasn't the best either. I resorted to distracting myself with TV and Videogames. I tried to binge-watch every movie we had and got 10% and got bored. I started having more girly thoughts in middle school. When puberty hit it didn't make things better. I got depressed about my appearance at this time was thin and non-muscular. I didn't fit in so I didn't do extra stuff after school. I was in the choir at this time in middle school. I also hit a low point where everything hurt me and wanted to suicide but I bounced back. The bullying and the chaos at home. I had a handful of friends that I trusted. I stole clothes from my mom and got outed and my family is Christian. My mom and stepdad did not like it and was grounded from going anywhere. So I didn't fully explore my fem side until recently. Now I'm happily married but the girly side of me (Alexis) seems stronger than ever before now that I'm older. Also, my mom texted my now wife and she thought I was gay and never told me which made me so upset that she never asked me to explain myself to her. But oh well. So I wanted to share this because I feel a little better now. I don't expect anything from this post. I just wanted to post my feelings and thoughts. And I'm also one person that will watch girly movies and cry during movies at some points. I currently have been buying more girly clothes and wear them some out in public and some just house wear.

2020-01-13 21:40:42,eoauwv,1,1,"This is both a question and a search for guidance of some sort. Anyone can reply but I’d really appreciate the input of those who have both social and physical dysphoria and have or want to medically transition in some way. 

• What does it feel to be more than one gender, especially if they’re on opposite sides of the spectrum? How do you experience dysphoria? Do you desire different things regarding your body and presentation according or you feel? Do you try to mix up things and appear androgynous, or do you switch to appear one way?

I’d really like to know because for a while, I’ve felt very confused about my gender. I’m a 19 year old trans guy. I came to that realization when I was 15, and I’m 6 months on testosterone, got my name and gender marker legally changed. I appreciate every step that I’ve taken, but sometimes I don’t feel so sure about anything. I don’t regret anything, but sometimes I wonder if this is truly the right path. 

After I came out, my dysphoria was mostly social but as the time passed the physical one increased as well. Regardless, I knew from day one I wanted testosterone and top surgery at least. Last year physical dysphoria reached crippling levels and I finally decided to start HRT or else I would have killed myself. I immediately felt better. Everyone can see it too, I’ve been told I look happier and even my best friend told me she never saw a future for me as my AGAB, even before coming out to her. I really like the changes, or so I think. Over the past couple months, my dysphoria has decreased but also changed in weird ways. Sometimes I dissociate and disconnect from my body. Sometimes I still feel like crying over it. Sometimes I’ll pose naked in front of the mirror. Most of the time I acknowledge I look good, but it’s not what i want for myself. But other times I kind of... Feel okay with it? Same goes for clothing and pronouns and everything gendered. I don’t think I want to be a woman in any capacity, but sometimes I kind of find myself wishing I was one, not without a deep sense of uneasiness.

Most of the time I look the changes that my body is undergoing but sometimes I feel indifferent. On the rare occasions I worry I don’t actually like them. I’ve talked to my psychiatrist about it and coupled with other things she says it’s most likely to be some form of OCD rather than having a different gender identity than the one I think I have, but I still can’t help but feel anxious and stressed. 

Just yesterday I decided to wear some of my old clothes. I thought I looked pretty but the more time I spent wearing them the more uneasy I felt, until I could no longer acknowledge my reflection as mine and broke down. I changed to my usual clothes and felt better for a while, until I caught my brain missing the experience. It doesn’t even make sense. I didn’t actually enjoyed it. It’s like I miss being my AGAB but whenever I do something connected to it I freak out and the dysphoria comes back. A vicious cycle. 

• Do I sound trans? Maybe not a binary trans guy after all, but genderfluid or bigender perhaps? Or am I simply experiencing fluctuations in dysphoria that make my identity feel less set in stone? Or do I just sound like someone snapping out of transness that will eventually regret all of this? 

I know no one can truly answer these last questions but as I said, I’d really like some input. I need to know I’m not going crazy and that other trans people might have experienced similar things.",NonBinary,What does it feel to be more than one gender?

I appreciate every step that I’ve taken, but sometimes I don’t feel so sure about anything. I don’t regret anything, but sometimes I wonder if this is truly the right path. \n\nAfter I came out, my dysphoria was mostly social but as the time passed the physical one increased as well. Regardless, I knew from day one I wanted testosterone and top surgery at least. Last year physical dysphoria reached crippling levels and I finally decided to start HRT or else I would have killed myself. I immediately felt better. Everyone can see it too, I’ve been told I look happier and even my best friend told me she never saw a future for me as my AGAB, even before coming out to her. I really like the changes, or so I think. Over the past couple months, my dysphoria has decreased but also changed in weird ways. Sometimes I dissociate and disconnect from my body. Sometimes I still feel like crying over it. Sometimes I’ll pose naked in front of the mirror. Most of the time I acknowledge I look good, but it’s not what i want for myself. But other times I kind of... Feel okay with it? Same goes for clothing and pronouns and everything gendered. I don’t think I want to be a woman in any capacity, but sometimes I kind of find myself wishing I was one, not without a deep sense of uneasiness.\n\nMost of the time I look the changes that my body is undergoing but sometimes I feel indifferent. On the rare occasions I worry I don’t actually like them. I’ve talked to my psychiatrist about it and coupled with other things she says it’s most likely to be some form of OCD rather than having a different gender identity than the one I think I have, but I still can’t help but feel anxious and stressed. \n\nJust yesterday I decided to wear some of my old clothes. I thought I looked pretty but the more time I spent wearing them the more uneasy I felt, until I could no longer acknowledge my reflection as mine and broke down. I changed to my usual clothes and felt better for a while, until I caught my brain missing the experience. It doesn’t even make sense. I didn’t actually enjoyed it. It’s like I miss being my AGAB but whenever I do something connected to it I freak out and the dysphoria comes back. A vicious cycle. \n\n• Do I sound trans? Maybe not a binary trans guy after all, but genderfluid or bigender perhaps? Or am I simply experiencing fluctuations in dysphoria that make my identity feel less set in stone? Or do I just sound like someone snapping out of transness that will eventually regret all of this? \n\nI know no one can truly answer these last questions but as I said, I’d really like some input. I need to know I’m not going crazy and that other trans people might have experienced similar things.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'What does it feel to be more than one gender?

I'll try to make this short but can't make promises. I was 12 when I first fell in love, with a girl. it ended up badly, which led me to hate myself and rejecting my sexuality. At the same time, I started to struggle with substances, anorexia, and bulimia.

 At 16 I got pregnant, and my life was just a mess in general. I had flings with girls on and off but on the low, again, because of my own homophobia. at 19 I got into an abusive relationship that lasted 5 years until I could finally put an RO and break the spell. So here I am, 24, in therapy, on the right meds, last year I came to terms with being bisexual, but just lately I feel like the ""woman"" label is bothering me so much.

 I'm your average chubby purple-haired bisexual with a septum.

I have been bullied for not being girly when I was younger, and after finding out that I had a girlfriend, some classmates would make fun of me and call me slurs for being a ""lesbian"". So much that I became obsessed with makeup at some point and being a woman, I guess. I wore it like armor, I needed to prove to people that I was a woman somehow so that they would leave me alone.

Full tank top with a second layer of compression over the chest, both layers sport strength. I told her my chest was getting in the way of Everything and we didn't even talk about it! She just...picked some out, had me try them on for comfort, and bought two the next time we went school shopping, at least six months later. She remembered. 

Now, I did *not* know what it was. I was pretty oblivious because my mom was so insanely accepting, I just accepted everything the same way. So I did not know that Ma was buying me a binder that day...but she sure as heck did. 

Mom was bi, everything-positive, and exceptionally well-educated. There's no way she didn't know what it actually was. My Ma totally bought me Darling's First Binder. I just wanted to share that wholesome realization. &lt;3

I’ve been struggling a bit recently with my gender. I am a *very* curvy AFAB and have the hardest time feeling comfortable in my NB identity, because I have to wear women’s clothes. Men’s shirts either do not button all the way or are way too baggy and men’s pants just straight up do not fit. I have yet to find women’s clothes that fit AND are gender affirming. 

The post that read “you can be non-binary without being androgynous” (or close to that haha) was uplifting, but like... sometimes I WANT to be androgynous. I feel like people don’t take my identity seriously if I look like woman. 

Also, I have a wedding coming up and the dress I’ve got is GORGEOUS and I look great in it (humble brag) but I’m still a “bride.” In a dress. On “her” wedding day.

Bit of a long one ahead....\n\nI’ve been struggling a bit recently with my gender. I am a *very* curvy AFAB and have the hardest time feeling comfortable in my NB identity, because I have to wear women’s clothes. Men’s shirts either do not button all the way or are way too baggy and men’s pants just straight up do not fit. I have yet to find women’s clothes that fit AND are gender affirming. \n\nThe post that read “you can be non-binary without being androgynous” (or close to that haha) was uplifting, but like... sometimes I WANT to be androgynous. I feel like people don’t take my identity seriously if I look like woman. \n\nAlso, I have a wedding coming up and the dress I’ve got is GORGEOUS and I look great in it (humble brag) but I’m still a “bride.” In a dress. On “her” wedding day. \n\nAny support, kind words, clothing advice is greatly appreciated!\n\nPeace and love,\nAb', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'AFAB struggles', 'created': 1579039152.0}"

2020-01-14 23:00:27,eot69a,17,1,"Hi!
First of all I hope yall are having a nice day and I'm sorry as this post might be a pretty long one.
You see my ""question"" is not really a question but rather I would like to know your opinions about this small personal matter of mine. But let's get to the point, for my whole life I've been something that as was recently brought to my attention acting and feeling close to what a non-binary from what I'm aware of is and yet I'm unable to fully understand few things I kept seeing in the ""non-binary community"" so I've decided to make this post and inquire more. But what do I mean by ""close"" to non-binary? By that I mean that I kinda just don't give a crap about my gender like sure my body is male and I was born that way so I'll say I'm male but like I just don't really give a single f*** about if I'm male or female I can wear skirts and makeup (which I would probably do more if it wasn't such a pain in the ass to put on since it's fun) and I can wear sweat pants and a hoodie it doesn't make a difference to me if it's comfy. But every non binary person I meet has this I don't know how to name it but they have this thing that makes it feel like non-binary is another gender especially with how much weight they put on calling them by gender neutral pronouns etc. And honestly it feels kinda weird for me especially when I'm sitting there not caring about what pronoun anyone uses towards me (it makes for funny interactions sometimes though since different people use different pronouns and even a different name sometimes). And I don't know maybe I've just been thinking about being non binary the wrong way and thus thinking about myself in a wrong term or am I missing something?

2020-01-15 04:57:54,eoxq6h,1,1,"Hi all, maybe a vaguely niche question, but I was wondering if anybody had advice for being nonbinary in a childcare setting? Specifically younger kids, probably 4-5 at the oldest.

I recently began working in such a setting, and it's been fun except for the occasional question (Are you a boy? Why does your voice sound like that? etc. etc.)

I know these are totally innocent questions, they're just curious kids, so I'm not too torn up about them, but I'm wondering if anybody has advice for how to respond to that sort of question?

2020-01-15 21:42:06,ep8ynb,5,1,"Sorry, this is a pretty long one, but I just need to get this out of my system-
So, I recently came out as nonbinary, and I have felt especially euphoric, and it’s just,,, so especially liberating, really! And I have not been so happy or really felt like truly me for some time, and it’s so nice to be able to identify myself and resolve some previous issues I had with myself and my appearance/behavior. 
The annoying part is that no one else seems to care, excepting maybe three or four people. People are avidly refusing to call me Eden and use my new pronouns, and it’s bothering me that people who I used to enjoy being around are so close-minded. They don’t seem malicious, but where I live and with the school I go to, it is not uncommon to see incredibly homophobic and transphobic people. They just think along the lines of, “Oh, well I know you as a girl, and I’ve been calling you (deadname) since I met you, so I’m just not going to change.” So many people have also been making jokes about it lately, and it seems like as soon as I came out, everyone is making the ‘there’s only two gender’ punchline jokes around me. I am also struggling with the urge to tell my parents, because I want to share this with them, for them to know why I’ve felt so much more happy and like myself lately. I just don’t think their reaction would be a positive one, and I don’t think they’d support me or believe me. I’m thinking I’ll bring it up with my therapist since he’s pretty non-judgmental, but I still worry a lot. I just feel like I am trapped in this new closet in which I get to feel like myself, but being myself is just causing everything to hurt me more.
I don’t know why this is getting to me so much, but I just felt like I could share my feelings here. Because, honestly, this community is one of the few places that I feel like I can really be open, and I absolutely love the warm and open-minded environment I stumbled upon here-
Anyway, thanks for the time, I just needed to get this out of my system. I love you all, and please have a wonderful rest of your day!

They don’t seem malicious, but where I live and with the school I go to, it is not uncommon to see incredibly homophobic and transphobic people. They just think along the lines of, “Oh, well I know you as a girl, and I’ve been calling you (deadname) since I met you, so I’m just not going to change.” So many people have also been making jokes about it lately, and it seems like as soon as I came out, everyone is making the ‘there’s only two gender’ punchline jokes around me. I am also struggling with the urge to tell my parents, because I want to share this with them, for them to know why I’ve felt so much more happy and like myself lately. I just don’t think their reaction would be a positive one, and I don’t think they’d support me or believe me. I’m thinking I’ll bring it up with my therapist since he’s pretty non-judgmental, but I still worry a lot. I just feel like I am trapped in this new closet in which I get to feel like myself, but being myself is just causing everything to hurt me more.\nI don’t know why this is getting to me so much, but I just felt like I could share my feelings here. Because, honestly, this community is one of the few places that I feel like I can really be open, and I absolutely love the warm and open-minded environment I stumbled upon here-\nAnyway, thanks for the time, I just needed to get this out of my system. I love you all, and please have a wonderful rest of your day! \n-💛   💜🖤', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'A little upset and frustrated,,', 'created': 1579149726.0}"

I’ve ID’d as nonbinary for coming up on a few years now. I’ve always been relatively ok being perceived as a woman and using she/her since I’m very visibly AFAB, until recently. Now I’m at a point where I’m having some pretty significant dysphoric moments and I’m considering trying to pursue a physical transition of some sort. 

I still ID as nonbinary, not even really trans masc. I’m hesitant to try to seek out anything medical because I’m worried I won’t get taken seriously, since my transition goal would not be to “pass” as male. The healthcare system here in the USA is not easy to navigate cost-wise, and there are some issues that could come up around that for me if a doctor deemed transitioning to be “unnecessary”.

I identify as nonbinary, so, not cis, but I've been on the fence about whether or not I consider myself trans. After seeing some discourse on the subject, I've found myself thinking more and more about it, but I still can't seem to come to an answer. 

On the one hand, cis and trans identities seem like opposite sides of a coin-- if you aren't cis, you're inherently trans, and vice versa. On the other, I have trouble reconciling the idea that those two identities are a binary when we've come to understand that almost nothing to do with gender or sexuality actually follows a binary pattern. My gender feels somewhere in the middle of that spectrum, and as such my identity feels somewhere in the middle of cis and trans. 

I'm fairly sure there's no one-size-fits-all answer here, and I'm not necessarily looking to resolve my own identity crisis here either.

2020-01-16 22:15:37,epqlwf,36,1,"tl:dr: My nb partner thinks my continued identification as a lesbian invalidates their identity. Thoughts? 

I \[21F\], a cisgender lesbian, have been dating my wonderful non-binary partner \[27\] for 2.5 years. We met at a pride event for lesbians, and they have used they/them pronouns for as long as I have known them (which I thought was awesome!) and identified somewhat with the butch subculture. We began dating pretty soon after, and as we grew as people and as a couple, they felt comfortable exploring a more explicitly non-binary identity. I know there is a long, diverse, chronically undercelebrated history of non-binary lesbians… but my partner isn’t that. They’re averse to the label, and no longer interact with or identify with the lesbian community. This is something I am happy to support.  They are such bright, creative, intelligent person, and the way they choose to identify is up to them! I am just happy to be the little lesbian who loves them.

But my partner doesn’t like it. They would rather I change my identity to bisexual or pansexual or just do away with the label altogether. I hear their hurt, I really do: they worry about how it reflects my love for them, and about whether I would be happier with a woman, and about whether my reluctance to get rid of that label means I don’t think of them as non-binary, or that I’m hoping they eventually change their mind. It clearly causes them pain. We fight over it, and it’s crept into worrying about the future. 

The thing is I love being a lesbian. It’s such a huge part of how I see myself. It’s an identity that is precious to me and represents all the good things I have come to be surrounded by. I chose to be disowned for this identity, but I also chose to be loved for this identity. It’s so much more than the reductive idea of “women who love women” and I don't think my identity and relationship are mutually exclusive, but my partner doesn't agree. It’s history, community, culture. I never worried that falling in love with my partner threatened my identity in any way. I’ve always been me, just as they have always been them, no matter what that looks like. If they ever decided gender confirmation procedures like surgery or hormones were necessary to allow them to live their fullest, I would support them 100%, and I have told them this. But I’d still be a lesbian. (\*I wouldn’t want to out them of course, and for now they are not transitioning\*)

I’m not sure what to do. I feel slighted by my partner, like they want me to make some big reverse-coming out announcement, like they’re asking me to change some deep part of myself when I don’t ask that of them. But at the same time, do I? I don’t have clarity on the issue… and I’m miserable knowing that this fills them with doubt about themselves. Has anyone experienced this before, themselves or in a partner? What did you do? What do you think? I’m open to some real talk, so be harsh if you have to. Just know that I love this person as much as I love myself, not more or less, and I want us both to be free and happy. Thanks for letting me vent.

This is kinda long and Englisch is not my first language. But I had to tell people who maybe understand me, like my friends support me and are by my side but the don’t get it, if y’all know what I mean.

So I started university in October in a new city. So after moving and all that stuff I started looking for some free time activities. And I came across a female American football team, a sport I wanted to try out for years now. Maybe because it’s something primarily associated with men and though I consider myself non-binary, I am more masculine and interested in „men‘s stuff“. So I asked the team if I can tryout for them and soon after that I started playing.

And let me tell y’all, the non-binary euphoria I feel while playing is impossible to describe. Because it doesn’t matter what you identify as, if you have short hair, look typically masculine.. as long as you run to the ball and hit the shit out of your opponents, nobody cares. And I’m so happy that for 2 hours a few days a week I don’t have to constantly present myself in some way... so my mother****ing dysphoria doesn’t get triggered. 

I hope all of y’all find something that makes you feel the same way. Because everybody deserves happiness and being comfortable in your body, even if it’s just for 2 hours a day.

2020-01-17 00:13:34,eps8lm,9,1,"A few things about myself: 

My real name is Naomi, which I don’t mind at all, but I really like Mickee. It’s a nickname that my family used to call me. I really like it because it is gender neutral and I’ve always had a preference for gender neutral names, such as Alex. My boyfriend always calls me Mickee without any problems, but I kinda wish everyone around me would call me that as well. It just seems weird asking people to call me a different name when I’m not actively transitioning.

I don’t exactly experience dysphoria. I have pretty big boobs and I’m alright with them, but I think I only really like them because they balance out how chubby I am. I don’t mind having female genitals outside of just suffering because of periods. 

As for clothing, I really swing from super feminine styles to very androgynous/butchy styles. I’m usually more afraid to explore the second style though, but lately, I’ve really been wanting to explore this side. 

In general, I just often kind of feel like a spirit in a vessel? Like I don’t think “oh yeah I’m a girl” but I just feel like my soul is genderless, if that makes sense. I do have moods where I love putting on makeup and wearing skirts and having long hair, but other days I just feel very uncomfortable in that kind of attire.

Normally I just wouldn’t give this kind of thing a second thought, but this feeling of being genderless has been getting stronger and stronger over the years. I just wanted to hear what you guys have to say. :)

Some context, I guess. I've been out as a trans man (although some people know me as a non-binary guy) for several years now. I think I came out when I was about 14 or 15. I had no idea how I felt at the time, but I had always felt like I was GNC or gender neutral. I came out as genderfluid, then transmasc, and basically ""came out"" to figure out how I felt about things. Later, I started to like the male pronouns and started experiencing dysphoria. I'm now 18. That doesn't seem like a very long time, but it was long enough that being a guy feels engrained into my identity. The thing is, I don't feel happy. That's obviously for other reasons besides my gender identity, but I feel so confused and like I'm repressing that I'm actually a woman. Detransitioning (socially only) at this point feels like an insane thing to do because being a guy feels like a part of who I am. But I feel like I haven't been able to process my emotions for a long time. About a year ago I was pretty happy with my identity and had finally started to feel comfortable with it and my body...but now I feel like everything is changing. I still don't really enjoy feminine things, want a feminine name, or particularly want to be seen as a girl. But being a guy hurts me, it feels like it is making me hate my body and I live constantly in doubt that I am really a man. I don't have the confidence to express my masculinity fully either. In regards to my sexuality, I'm currently out as bi or pan but I feel like I'm really mostly attracted to men, and in the past this has been the case. On the other hand, stating that I'm soley attracted to one gender feels really limiting, possibly because it places me in a gender designation (het woman, if I am not a man) I'm really not comfortable with (and it just feels limiting). I really wish I could live without gendered expectations at all and embrace my gender fluidity. As an artist, I feel like I relate heavily to all genders and it feels unnatural to have to pick one way of expressing or describing myself, but perhaps that is another thing entirely than my actual lived gender. In any case, I've been questioning my identity for years now and it is exhausting, confusing, and dysphoria inducing. I wish I could call myself non-binary to bridge the divide, but I don't think anyone would take it seriously and I don't know what that would mean for my transition plans. I also think I would still have the creeping suspicion that I am actually just a woman with internalized misogyny- something I did not feel I had at all until recently. With the way I feel about my sex, it's definitely more of a physical thing than a defining characteristic. I don't want to say I'm a woman because I'm not really, considering the social context. I'm just a person.

Anyway, these are my thoughts. I'm sorry this is so long, thank you if you have taken the time to read it. I should probably talk to my therapist about this but I don't want people to think I'm a woman again. I don't know if I could take the dysphoria.

My insurance's website is NOT up to date so I just ended up calling random people on the website until I found someone who was actually available. Turns out the doc I chose was actually like one of the heads of the residency program family medicine building. Basically, what that meant was that while I saw him at my initial visit, every other visit I might be seeing other doctors, because this was the family medicine branch where new doctors and med students did their residency. At first I was kind of nervous, but everyone was incredibly nice, AND because it was MultiCare, had a lot of financial aid options. The receptionist who checked me in was great about pronouns and noticed my they/them pin on my jacket. So when it came time to ask me questions about gender etc, she was really respectful about it. Everyone there was really respectful, and the doctor himself was young but also really knowledgeable about trans stuff, as well as knowledgeable about the fact that some trans-related boxes to check in his system were a little rigid and didn't quite fit for my nonbinary identity. He actually was like ""I know this probably doesn't align 100% with your identity, but the world hasn't quite caught up yet. We're working on it."" He even asked me if I cared how my genitalia were referred to, which is a question that I've never been asked but is really awesome! He also introduced himself with his pronouns and in general was pretty knowledgeable not just about (binary) trans stuff but nonbinary stuff as well. Also he was absolutely delighted when I told him that I was there for a referral for top surgery-related stuff. He said, ""I love seeing patients achieve their dreams."" All in all it was really nice. 

Afterwards, I kind of had the realization that there's actually probably a good reason: I assume that most older doctors weren't taught about trans people in med school unless they specifically searched it out. However, I think not only are trans and nonbinary identities a lot more mainstream now, but I think they're also somewhat taught in med school as well. Which means the newer medical residents are coming in actually educated and aware of trans and nonbinary identities instead of patients having to teach them everything. (Also I'm kind of weirdly excited because it would be a good thing for newer doctors to have trans patients and get that experience early on and I'm pretty okay with being that guinea pig.)

So yeah, if you have like a residency program doctor's office to go to, maybe try it? They might be really great with trans stuff?

2020-01-17 12:02:37,epzhi6,15,1,"It’s 3:30 am and I’m lying here awake because I’m finally processing what my husband’s friend said earlier. We were waiting for our video game to start and he referred to the group as, “Ladies and gents and Apache helicopters”. Mind you, the room consisted of my husband, a (enby questioning) man, our roommate, a trans woman, the offending friend, a cis man, and me, a non-binary person. 

At the time I was really just shocked and I muttered, “Yeah I guess that’s me...” under my breath. 

Our roommate on the other hand told him, “That was a stupid joke,” immediately, and a few minutes later said, “I know it was said in jest, but that joke was really not okay.” I really appreciated her saying something and thanked her for doing so after he left. But honestly the fact that she had to say that - as a trans woman - was deeply upsetting to me. How many times has he made that joke around “allies” and had no one say anything?? How could this person, who knows she’s trans and that I’m non-binary, come into our home and say that? I know he was trying to be edgy, and as a 6’6”, white, upper middle class, son of a cop he’s got a pretty skewed world view - but come on. 

He also misgendered me several times today, and has misgendered my roommate on multiple occasions in the recent past as well. I’m feeling deeply hurt and frustrated by the whole thing. My husband was also shocked by the comment, but this guy is one of his oldest friends so I don’t think he knew what to say at the time. It took me a few hours to really wrap my mind around what happened, but once I did I explained to my husband how upset I was by his friend’s behavior and why. He says that he’s going to have a talk with him, so we’ll see how that goes. As a 5’1” AFAB enby who is not close at all to this guy, I don’t feel comfortable talking to him about this (although last time he was over &amp; said “Ladies, quiet down” to my femme friend and I, intoxicated me pointedly replied, “I’m not a lady” &amp; was met w the most bewildered expression). I just really hope he learns something from this because idk what I’ll do if he doesn’t figure out how to act real soon. 

Thanks for reading my middle of the night rant on this whole situation.

I've been feeling low for a few reasons, SO rejection (were in therapy), coming out to parents (father is a born again), dog has some behavior issues, and we have a kid on the way to name just a few stressors. 

So to work it out, I went to yoga, class was full. So not wanting to go home, I went to the community center near me that I've been frequenting. I was welcomed with open arms, given some sage (it's a shamanic center), and was welcomed into a mom's group. This was huge. I'm AMAB. I cried my eyes out in front of 4 other women.  Well in the end, I was welcomed back whenever I needed. I was told that in being non-binary, I can be a badass mom in a biologically male body. 

So I hope you all have a safe space you can go when you feel the worst. There are safe places, accepting people despite our struggles, and it isn't necessarily an lgbt group. There is hope.

2020-01-18 10:30:24,eqev0t,6,1,"Hi all, throwaway since this is my Actual Birth Name. I figured it'd get too confusing to try to ask about this using similar but different names. I'm active on here and r/agender on my main account. 

I'm in my 30s and I've been out as genderqueer (and poly and pansexual) for most of my adult life but in the last year have decided to settle on 'agender' and be **OUT!!** as non-binary they/them, with the pronoun pins and email signature and so on. Got the X on my drivers license and everything! Because of this I've been feeling really valid; as a nonbinary person with the paperwork done, *everything* I do is non-binary! Yah!

&amp;#x200B;

One thing that I've been ruminating on, however, is my name. My birth name is Ann and I go by Annie. I like my name and I intend to keep using it. I have several degrees and publications by my name and the sound 'Ah-nee' or 'An' (rhymes with 'pan') feels like *me*. My second language doesn't have a name for Ann(ie) that I like so I made my own version with the vowels and consonants that are closest to 'Annie'. 

&amp;#x200B;

*But* I am aware that Ann(ie) is a feminine name and doesn't signal that I'm non-binary to strangers. I've used Andrew, Anders, and Andy online when I didn't want to attract attention in male-dominated areas. Ann (pronounced Onn) appears to be a male name in some Scandinavian countries but I've never asked how prevalent that is. I was so excited when Phantom Menace came out and Annie was used as a nickname for (male) Anakin but uhhhhh that film didn't go over so well and Annie didn't enter pop culture as a unisex name. 

&amp;#x200B;

My compromise has been using An in places where I can because it's short and unusual enough to make people pause. But legally I'm staying Ann, and I still really like the name Annie. Anie appears a bit difficult to pronounce and Ani makes me think of Ani DiFranco.

2020-01-19 06:24:39,eqsviq,4,1,"QUESTIONS PLUS RANT

A follow up (sort of) of my last post + a couple questions

I literally don’t know what to do after telling my mom about being non-binary, half of me wants to never talk about it again and she’ll forget, and the other half wants me to send her this website that explains non-binary better than I did so she will understand

After telling her I regretted it severely because of how awkward and nervous I was, and I thought that maybe I’m just a normal girl but then I think about it more and yes I do think I am non-binary and I am not a girl or a boy. 

My mom kept asking me questions that I didn’t know how to answer so I just sat there quietly while the awkward silence grew....

I withheld information because I was practically crying for no reason tbh... I wanted to go more into depth about pronouns and being called Ash but I didn’t even mention the name because I was too nervous

For some reason I felt bad for my mom while telling her and that’s probably not good, I should be confident and telling her my viewpoint but I couldn’t 

IMPORTANT QUESTION

What do I do if I come out and start going by they/them and Ash and I end up wanting to go back to she her and my birth name? Is that just something I can tell everyone again?

“In the twentieth century we shall live among strange faces, new paintings, and unheard of sounds. Many, lacking an inner glow, will freeze and feel nothing but coolness, and will flee into the ruins of their recollection.” 

-Franz Marc

Gender seems to have two very common interpretations within my own conversations: one is that gender IS  biological sex and that there is an interchangeability with these two words: I have also seen the phrase, “sexual orientation” within the conceptual world view of the former act as the conduit for the meaning imbued in the word “gender” within the latter interpretation: possibly from how orientation itself is defined, whether this is an appropriate use of the word-phrase is one thing however it seems that the meaning one might imbue the word “gender” within the latter interpretation has a place in the former. The latter interpretation of gender ,as I understand it, is that “gender” is the expression of a “biological reality”. I want to explore gender through these two interpretations going forward in conveying—clarifying my own understanding and interpretation of gender.

Perspectivity-Identity

“Salt arises from the purest sources, the sun and the sea’.”

—Pythagoras 

I wanted to begin by talking about the double-nature of “perspectivity” involved with identity; the is—am. Perspectivity, from a gebsarian point of view is ,in short, exactly that, a “point of view”: the double nature is what seems to me to be via the intensification of awareness(conscious—multi-structural) influencing our present understanding of the —perhaps ineffable— diaphanous complex that is the “human itself” as well as its relationship-interrelationship with the intersectional “whole”. This co-present double-nature involved in our intensified awareness and continual manifestation of understanding is in some sense to “collapse—transmute” the raw-somnolent manifold of the “human itself” into simulacrums of itself; pre-identity transposed into that relative simultaneity of rigid-insight via definings—namings of “what” we find ourselves intensely aware of ,hence, points of view. 

“..the word was predominantly a tool: it represented, recounted, and described the world. In other words, a temporally qualitative, primordial element was placed in the service of measuring, mental thought.”

 -Jean Gebser 
——————————————————————————

REPHRASE: So one thing I mention here and what I’ll be mentioning a lot throughout this thread is: “biological reality” and “the human itself”, what I’m trying to get at with these phrases is a way of talking about the-our entire physical structure, I didn’t use the word “sex” because I’ve always held the predisposed belief that the term “sex” only refers to a set of parts in regards to ourselves. In regards to the concept of gender and gender-identity I wonder how much more about ourselves (assuming sex only refers to a portion of ourselves) influences how we identify ourselves, especially in juxtaposition to how society identifies us. 

I also talk about “the intersectional whole” and it’s interrelationship with “the diaphanous -perhaps ineffable- complex of the human itself”: I touch on this further throughout the thread but what I’m trying to get across is my predisposed belief that we are influenced by the world around us and vice versa: the way we think about ourselves: I humor that our gender-identity is influenced by external forces aswell as internal forces and because of that our identity is intersectional and perhaps impossible to fully capture with language which....

....The “co-present double-nature” of perspectivity is talking about how at any point when we develop an understanding of ourselves or another .through continual awareness of things as time and space around us passes, we are shedding light on something that is essentially without name and the reason why I describe the nature as “rigid-insight” is because words are not only interpretive but I also think they do not capture the whole “thing” in which we are identifying with and that may make things difficult for ourselves and others when our description-identity we impose on what we are trying to convey isn’t shared by others or even ourselves as time and space around us continues to pass.

2020-01-20 19:02:43,erhshs,8,1,"Using T cream locally for bottom growth

CW: this whole thing is full of genitals 

Hey y’all,

Haven’t seen a ton posted on here about this so I thought I’d start a discussion thread. 

I’m using low dose topical T cream applied to my genitals daily with the goal of achieving some bottom growth without too many of the other effects of T.

I’m a 31 year old AFAB NB person. My big goals for medical transition are bottom growth and stopping my period. The reason for my application of T directly to my genitals is to hopefully keep my systemic T levels from getting high enough to cause permanent changes like voice drop and significant body and facial hair growth. I do not plan on being on T long term, and will likely discontinue T if my voice begins to significantly drop - I’m less concerned about facial and body hair. I’m not on enough T to stop my period, so I’m testing out different methods of hormonal birth control to accomplish that. 

Here’s what y’all really want to know:

1) is it working? What’s it like?

Yes. It’s working. I started T on December 18, 2019 (3.5 weeks ago) and I’ve noticed fairly significant changes with regard to bottom growth. When hard/engorged I’m probably at about 0.5 inches currently. 

For the first 2-2.5 weeks it was kinda overwhelming. I felt very sensitive and stimulation could become overwhelming very quickly. This isn’t to say things felt bad, just a difference degree of sensation and sensitivity which for me made me feel like I was lacking the stamina I previously had. Now the sensitivity is at a way more manageable level. 

Persistent arousal is/was a thing. It definitely has become more manageable over time, but I still get turned on a lot, by a lot. The sensation of arousal is different with more of a “popping a boner” feeling and increased blood flow/engorgement. 

Other bodily changes: a little stinkier and sweatier. A little bit of hormonal acne along chin/jawline. 


SEX TALK

Receiving oral sex feels totally different. I have always been a fan of getting blow jobs - for me oral sex that involves more sucking/suction - but now there’s more for folks to suck on. 

I’ve begun squirting regularly. Both during partner sex (mostly blow jobs) and solo (mostly using a satisfyer 11/10 would recommend). 

I still get sufficiently wet when aroused, but seems to have less staying power than it did pre-T.  Beyond that, no difficulties with penetrative sex. 


END SEX TALK


2) are you using testogel? What’s your dose?

No, it’s not testogel. My prescription is filled by a compounding pharmacy and they mix the testosterone in a cream that’s specifically for genital application. This is because testogel has alcohol in it and therefore can irritate the sensitive membranes in that area.  

According to my prescription, each dose is 2.5mg. I think this is of 1% concentration, but to be honest my script doesn’t say. I apply it once daily - usually before bed so it can hang out undisturbed for a while - directly to my external genitalia. 

3) where did you get this? Did you order it from that overseas pharmacy?

I am fortunate enough to have a trans competent doctor at my university’s campus health clinic. She wrote me a prescription for this cream specifically. A 3 month supply cost me $89, none of it covered by insurance. I have heard about people ordering DHT cream (different from Testosterone cream or gel) and applying it to their genitals for growth. However, DHT is hard to get and I have access to a good doc so I’m going the testosterone route. 

4) can I see pics?

Sure. Def down to share with other NBs. Message me. 

5) how did you think of this?!?!?

I was cruising around reddit trying to figure out if I could get permanent bottom growth while minimizing the other effects of T and ended up on a thread in an entirely different subreddit for cis women in the clitoral enlargement fetish scene. These women are trying to enlarge their clitorises. Some of these women are using DHT cream and some are using topical Testosterone applied directly to their clitorises. (You can search reddit and find these subreddits easily) DHT cream is not available in the United States and is difficult to get sent through customs unless you have a prescription.  I spoke with my healthcare provider, and though she had never heard of this before, she follows WPATH standards around informed consent and wrote me a prescription. She’s been very supportive and informed me of all the potential side effects of HRT. 

DISCLAIMER:

Every body is different. We cannot pick and choose which effects of T will happen when and to what extent. For example, prior to starting T my testosterone levels were already high, that is outside the normal range for AFAB ppl not undergoing HRT. This is likely from polycystic ovarian syndrome, but it could impact the way that the testosterone cream affects me and my results. There is no way of knowing right now. 

That said, there may be some validity to a low dose of T applied locally if a person’s goals are bottom growth and not much else, at least based on my experiences so far and the experiences of the aforementioned clitoral enlargement fetishists. Ultimately though, this is an experiment. I am aware that I may experience some changes with T that I am not shooting for and have accepted that as a potential side effect of my treatment.

There's nothing inside my mind that's telling me that I'm female, male, or anything else. Thinking about how I've felt about my gender in the past, I'm starting to warm to the idea that I'm actually Agender and always have been. I think the label ""transfeminine agender"" fits me, but I still want to call myself a trans woman based on my presentation. I'm not sure if I want to use the label ""non-binary"", though. It depends on the definition. My hesitance to use it feels like my hesitance about using ""pansexual"". It's mostly the worry that it doesn't fit me. I have an image of ""non-binary"" or ""agender"" as someone who is androgynous in appearance, even though there are people like Riley J Dennis who are non-binary but are very feminine and use she/her pronouns.

My hesitance might also be the concern that I do have an internal gender identity but just don't realize it. Does my desire to be female in every way possible mean that my internal identity really is female? Does my desire to have an internal sense outright telling me that I am female mean that my identity is female? Is that what an internal sense of gender is - a desire to be a specific gender?

Some things are clear, though. I am much happier with myself since transitioning. I love the name Katie. I love my full name, Jennifer Kathryn. I love when other people see me as a girl, and I love seeing myself as a girl! My only regret is not transitioning sooner.

I don't think I'm going to use the label ""Non-binary"", at least not right now. This is a topic that I re-visit once in a while, so things might change in the future. I have a ton of respect for non-binary people. There's a lot of hatred for them out there, even from some trans people, mostly due to misunderstanding what they are and what they're trying to accomplish.

it’s not like “reverse dysphoria” but is definitely fucking with my self-image. i feel like i’m tying way to hard to be fem when i want to be and i just look ugly and sad? idk, think buffalo bill from silence of the lambs. not a cool way to feel!

anyway, i do want to shave my legs but maintaining it is WAY too difficult, and i don’t want to have really weird smooth legs when masc??  the constant NB struggle of trying to balance your masc/fem/neutral energies. 

i do consider going off T in the future, and i will be on a much lower dose soon (100mg to 60mg per week). i’ve been on the 100mg dose for about 4 months, and have been off T as of now for a month due to T being on backorder and insurance issues, no changes detected except awful hormonal acne. 

is there any way i could lessen the hair growth i have without taking it all off? would bleaching it be weird? waxing? lasers? a more permanent way to lessen this growth? would reducing the T dose help? would going OFF T help?

I left a message with a therapist's office in my area that specializes in lgbtqia+ issues and am currently waiting for them to call me back.

So I've decided to do something fun and think about names. As a distraction. While I wait. And not panic. ;)

My birth name is really girly, and I absolutely love it as a name. I dont feel dysphoric over it. But I'm not sure if it fits me. So I've been looking up names to pass the time.

My last name is very similar to Copper so it would have to work with that.

Two names I love that could fit me are Auden and Marrin.

Auden is English for ""Old Friend""
Marrin is Latin for ""Of The Sea""

I quite like the two. I found a bunch I liked, but didnt quite fit.

About HRT, which medications are most effective/have the least side effects?

My stepfather is a great bit less open-minded than my mom, and would likely make my doubt and negative feelings worse.

I feel trapped in the closet, so much so that I have begun having nightmares about coming out, and the backlash and fear that would follow.

I had other post like this in MTF , but i realized that im nb and genderfluid in the last month and that i dont fit as Female but most of the time as demigirl. So im happy to be here.

I can resume the other post as ""i wanted to come out to my family , it went wrong ,the ambient got violent at home , i escaped from my home ,i started squating (bcs im an anarchist and i have ""contacts"" in the local anarchis movement) , the police gave us a letter telling us that they where going to evict us in the next 20 days , i started having problems with depression and self harm and i got caught stealing in a decathlon"".

First of all i want to say that we didnt get evicted , we are still fighting on court , and this could give us weeks or months before we get evicted. I've met really suportive people from the anarchist movement but also there is a lot of cis culture inside , like assuming pronoums and thing like that that needs to be changes. I started talking to to another transfem anarchist from another city and i really like her . Im also trying to unify the trans people of the anarchist movement in my city to make it more trans friendly and do talks and fight trasphobes , but this is a long project that its just starting.

I got news from my family , they are telling everyone that they supported me but they asked me to slow down, so they are washing their image . I still dont want to have any contact with them. I've been having nightmares with the abuses of my father everyday for the lask 3 weeks so i think im better alone.

Depression and self harm is still a problem. But i think i'm feeling better with my own identity. And i think being around great supportive people is the key for that , so Thank you to everyone that has treated me right in this hard months.

Oh , i almost forgot ... I have the decathlon trial on the 6 of march.

2020-01-23 16:09:20,esv6oj,3,1,"So I’ve pretty much know I’m non binary since I was a teenager but it hasn’t been until I moved away from my dangerous family and become friends with some incredible people that I’ve felt that this is a part of my identity that I felt safe in sharing. 

It wasn’t the fact that I preferred to play with trucks over barbies or anything like that... I honestly enjoyed presenting in a gender neutral way. I am biologically a woman but I loved it when I would get called “Sir” or called handsome. I have a very athletic figure and I love how strong I look and how broad my shoulders are because it matches more of how I feel inside and I just feel nonbinary suits me best but I’m worried about coming out and what it would mean for me and the stress it might cause my relationship...

My partner has always known I was nonbinary but I never pressed to be called they/them, which is how I identify, because I just didn’t want to make it awkward for my boyfriend...

I kinda feel like I just shouldn’t have said anything and looking online hasn’t helped much more than invalidate my identity and make me wonder if I’m just being unnecessarily hard work...

I feel so strongly about my identity that I literally went to a party a few years ago and my now best friend asked me “Avocado, what are your pronouns?” and I literally almost cried. 

I want To be able to openly say “Yes, I am a they/them” and feel safe and open and that I was living my truth...

How do I come out about it and ask people to use my pronouns and all? Am I really nonbinary and is it fair of me to put this on my boyfriend or should I just go back to being his girlfriend and just bury my identity... I don’t want anything to change I just want to be called they/them and be known as his partner rather than his girlfriend but at the same time I like being his girlfriend but this is who I am...

I am surrounded by so many wonderful non binary friends who are out and I want that too... I want to share this part of my identity and be open... My family aren’t in my life so I can’t be hurt...

This post is more or less a question because I've been feeling very confused, anxious and bereft this past month and have been looking for some answers and some support. So, let me begin.

I've recently been finding out a lot of stuff about myself, some new and intriguing things as well as stuff I kinda new before and it's been a journey about self identity and stuff like that..

A quick story, during my first two years of high school, I found out I was Bi. It wasn't all that shocking to me. It made sense. I liked girls like how I liked guys. It felt right and at the time, a label meant the world to me because I had a way of saying ""this is me"".

In high school, I thought I was genderfluid and went by that for a short time but it never really fit. It didn't feel right but the term ""Cis"" or ""Cisgendered"" felt weird to me too.. although, I went by that for a while.. I was always a girl and as I grew older, my peers made it apparent to me too. I would get comments like, ""guys wouldn't like you cause you dress too much like a guy"" or ""you're not feminine enough"" and so I strived to be more ""feminine"", even though I felt weird and ugly sometimes.

I remember there was a truly defining moment for me when I was in the 11th grade (I think, 11th grade) where a friend slapped me in the face, much to the shock of me and everyone around me and said, ""It's fine, It's only Sam."" I don't know. It left a lasting impression on me for a long, long time.

Back to the present! I've talked to a couple friends, speculating to them that I might be NB and they say that it makes a lot of sense, like the nicknames I would use to address myself or how I would dress or act and stuff like that, but.. I'm 21.. I'm worried that it's too late for me to come out and say ""Hey! I'm NonBinary!""

All of my NB friends that I've had in the past have figured out this stuff when they were in high school and came out or done something to go in that direction and I feel like I'm late to the party..

Is it too late for me to say that I'm NB or to figure that out for myself? Should I have figured out all this stuff at an earlier age or what? I don't know.. I would like some help answering these questions..

2020-01-25 19:42:23,etvgwc,2,1,"First off, the terms “women’s” and “men’s” clothing annoy me but for clarity I’ll be using them. My brain is kind of mush right now, any suggestions? I’m bad with words today and English isn’t my first language. 

I’m AFAB and have always felt uncomfortable in women’s clothes. Why do they have to accentuate my body?? Why is everything meant to be tight and form fitting?? I have an hourglass shape and shirts would always ride up, exposing everything below the waist. I was pulling them down so much I tore holes in them. I don’t want everyone to see what’s under my clothes and it always seemed like they’re cut for that purpose. And I always get ugly sweat stains around the armpits because apparently breathing room isn’t important. Also, I want functional pockets. I can’t help but think they do the fake pockets thing so women don’t put stuff in pockets that distorts their shape, making it hard for cis men to ogle and judge “accurately”. It’s hard to put into words. I’m endlessly frustrated about this. 

I’ve been wearing men’s T-shirts and hoodies for a couple of years and recently bought my first pair of men’s pants. Eddie Izard comes to mind when I say that (“it’s not a woman’s dress, it’s MY dress”), but yeah they were made for men. THE ROOM. THE FUNCTIONAL POCKETS. The crotch is so low my parts are never uncomfortable when sitting down. They don’t crawl up there either, making me anxious that I have the dreaded “cameltoe” (oh how I hate that word). They’re so comfortable I don’t wanna take them off. I’ll have to wash them at some point tho 😭 So getting more when my bank account agrees haha. 

I’m no longer constantly self conscious about my body in public. People can’t tell what my body looks like. Plus I wear everything way oversized, I go up at least 2 sizes. I used to suck in my (barely existent) belly. I don’t do that anymore. I could eat 10 whole cakes and nobody would be able to tell.

Looking at it a different way, they reject the gender binary as an inadequate and oversimplistic way to describe gender.\n\nWhat do the rest of you think? Is there anything about my definition which is off the mark, contradictory, or disrespectful?..."", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Some nonbinary definition discussion — selling fellow enby opinions', 'created': 1580061010.0}"

It's casual, and has the benefit of having 2 nurses attend who have experience working in trans healthcare/transitioning - both of whom have trans children and are FULLY supportive of all expressions and identities.  Talk about everything from dysphoria, to relationship issues, to transitioning struggles or fears about presenting yourself, to celebrations and support for positive steps. This place is the opposite of gatekeeping when it comes to transition, expression or identity.

2020-01-26 17:03:57,eu9bni,0,1,"Hi there r/NonBinary
I'm AFAB and all my life I've been fine with that. I was a typical girly girl as a child, then leaned more towards the tomboy side of things as a teen until now where I still like typically feminine things but also mostly wear masculine/unisex clothes

In the last year, I've stopped caring about my outward gender expression. While I still look feminine, I know that with the right clothes, I could also look masculine, and while that thought used to bother me in the past because I was scared to ""look like a boy"", I'm now indifferent and if anything, I like the idea. I love androgynous looks and it's something that's inspired me to change how I look (I used to have hair down to my lower back, but now just comes past my ears)

Don't get me wrong, I always have, and still identify with my birth sex and use she/her pronouns, and being he/him doesn't feel comfortable while they/them I'm ok with but it doesn't fit. I'm happy with my body and very rarely dislike my chest (sometimes I wish it was flatter but not in a dysphoric way)

But I've started to question if the way I feel is because I'm possibly a demigirl (or on that kind of spectrum) or if it's just how I now express myself. I know that gender roles mean nothing and you can do whatever you want, and that you don't need to label yourself either, but I'm also paranoid about claiming I'm anything other than cis because I feel fake and that I just want to ""fit in"" (Same thing happened while I was discovering my sexuality)

Sorry if this doesn’t make any sense. I've never really questioned my gender until the past year after finally being comfortable with being panro-ace

FUCK YES 2020.I PRESENT TO YOU CRISIS : A POEM ABOUT MYSELF AND MY LIFE.

——————————-

When will I ever stop masquerading as something I do not feel?
When does the moment I touch the sky become what is real?
When do I unearth the lies and begin to heal?
When do I realize who I am is not the whole deal?
When do I unzip completely from what once was a seal?

How do I begin to pick apart the peel?

Over the course of the past two years I have promoted this concept.
This innate ideal that I am not whole.
This raw thought of what should, and could I be?

How do I blend myself elegantly?
How do I blend in?
Do I even want to blend in?

I must want some luxury of fitting in.
I spent most of my school life trying to fit in until I realized I could not.
But I tried anyway.

Am I a sin?
Did I deserve being raped?
Do I present authentically?
Do represent the truth I preach?
Does my message ever reach?
Why does everyone feel like I’m arguing?
I swear I’m not trying to play devils advocate.
I’m not being combative; you just don’t understand.
That’s not your fault for not understanding.

Is there something I don’t understand?
I’ve always been able to see both sides.
But why do I ever rarely change my mind at all?

Do you know how to find the answers?
Am I to blind?
Both of my parents have cancers.
Should I give up this personal fight to be at their sides?
Why do my abusers deserve any light?

Are they at fault for the absurd misguidance I needed in my life?
I’m 23 Its time I accept some blame for not just doing this, right?
But I’m stuck in their world not mine.
Their rules on my time.
Slowly, ever so slowly will this idea die?
And the first moment I become what they need will my future dissolve?
How do I solve this in a new light?

I need to make my parents proud, they always tried to do me right.
They tried me in soccer- I would fight.
They tried me in band camp- I would cry.
They tried me in a play- I failed but they said that’s okay.
They tried me in basketball- my height got the best of me.
Baseball too, too weak for the bat. 
Fuck lacrosse I wasn’t even dude bro for that.
Track, yes Track, let me try that.
Hold on get addicted cigarettes so don’t do track.
Fall in love with a girl down the road 3 or 4 girls 3 or 4 different roads.
My voice dropped before chorus would hold.
Listen to the music you would wish to compose, now try but don’t forget about those
Who would say look at the joke who cannot hold a damn note?

Watch
 your
 friends 
die,
 they didn’t try that. 
They ignored that.

Date
 a 
boy? Or a a few?
They didn’t try that. They ignored that. They don’t even know that.

They ignored the bullies, no matter how bad.
If it became themselves, they pointed back and also laughed.
I have a hard time dealing with that.
I should be cutting my wrists to pretend I’m ignoring all those facts.

Hold on replace that.
Weed? (we’ll get back to that)
Xanax? Check.
Cocaine? Check?
Molly, k2, PCP, heroin? Ok go for that.
Why do I have wait for the 27 club, what the fuck is that?

Pause, breathe, relax. Try to keep yourself intact. You have one more year left of high school.
Meet the best friends of your life.
next year you’ll go berserk when you shake your head, finally get sober, then get cheated on by the girl you tried over and over to win over until it was over.
Maintain a few jobs, go to a few colleges, fall for a few guys a few more girls start to accept yourself and move on.

Finally have time to think back.
What did I miss but need now through all that?

2006? you played in that play pretend doll house with your friends, fake cooking bread. Slept over playing the Barbie game snuck over in a Hot Wheel’s box to save grace.
2010? Okay let the cross dressing begin.
Pause 2014-2016 for more rage.
Resume 2018.
Go to school meet some temp friends some hook ups also again
Come to think of it from 2010-2018 how many crushes did I have?
Do I know where to begin?
2019 fall in love with the first real love.
Real love.
Actual love.

I can accept myself again from within
Flexible self, soft skin.
Do I know who I am? 
Am I just biting time again?

I know what I am
Who I am…?

I’ve just been terrified to admit
Because being called “it” scares me enough
To not piss when / I sit.
And being brought up so aggressive is hard for friends to even forfeit.
My interests are my interests.
My attitude is mine.
But I am not who I am with.

I will fill in that line when I know what ones to draw.
Right now, I’m letting the non-binary label thaw.
First, I need to crawl before I walk.


I’m Ryan and

Is there a way to get, like, half of HRT to help look androgynous? I’m AMAB, so is there a dosage of E that would help make my life easier in regards to body dysphoria?

I was in a bit of a dark place back then, and without therapy, my mental health couldn’t really stand up against the increased stress of working for the first time. I quit the job after two months.

We booked the consultation anyway, because I live in the area of Dr. Dulin, who takes some insurances.

The cost would be $7200.

I ended up just putting it out of my mind after that, since that was way more money than my parents were willing to spend on something that they still don’t fully see as necessary. I’ve applied for a couple jobs since then that turned out to be dead ends, and I’ve also gone back to school at a community college, so my schedule is a touch limited now.

2020-01-29 15:18:33,evo795,17,1,"First of all, forgive me if I say something wrong, I promise I mean well!!!

 From my current understanding a non binary identity, it comes from a place of not feeling that binary male or female fits you, therefore you would be non binary. And for a long time I've thought of this as its own single gender, but I've just realised that that would create a kind of ""gender trinary""?

Preface

I want to preface this announcement by saying that I one hundred percent do not regret transitioning to male. I don't regret taking testosterone, and I plan on continuing to take it. Most importantly I don't regret my top surgery. I am still very happy with the results. I wouldn't change a thing.

What's going on

With that being said, I am not strictly male. I am nonbinary. Meaning (in my case) that I fall somewhere in between male and female, or possibly outside those terms all together. Nonbinary is an umbrella term for anyone other than just male or female. I am still working out exactly where I stand.

What will be changing

As you may have noticed, I've been dressing a little differently recently. In fact, my style has grown increasingly feminine as I've grown more masculine. I have been going further with this when I'm out with (my partner) or my friends. I have been wearing dresses again, and it makes me happy to do so. I understand this may seem strange to some people, especially because I was not a fan of dresses prior to my transition. 

The reason I am comfortable wearing feminine clothes now is because my body is more masculine and I'm not seen as a woman anymore. In a dress I look androgynous as opposed to before my transition where I just looked like a girl. I don't fully understand it and you don't have to either! All I ask is that you accept it and respect my choices.

What I ask of you

I plan on going by a gender neutral name from now on. After careful deliberation I have chosen the name Pigeon. I know it's a strange choice but I feel like it suits me and it makes me happy. I also request you start using singular they/them pronouns when referring to me. I do not mind he/him, but they/them is more correct and it is my preference. I understand it may take some getting used to and I'm prepared to be patient with everyone as they adjust. 

Conclusion

I have been repressing this for some time now and I have just recently come to terms with it. I've started allowing myself to express myself the way I truly want. I understand you probably have some questions, and I will answer them the best that I can. Regardless I hope that you understand and support me in this.

I want to preface my announcement by saying that I one hundred percent do not regret transitioning! I don't regret taking testosterone, and I plan on continuing to take it. I don't regret my top surgery. I am still very happy with the results. I wouldn't change a thing.

I know that first paragraph is a little worrying, but I promise this is nothing to worry about! I'm just nonbinary. In my case this means that I'm somewhere between male and female. I might even just be neither! Nonbinary is an umbrella term and I'm still figuring out exactly where I stand.

As you may have noticed, I've been dressing a little different recently. In fact, my style has grown increasingly feminine as I've grown more masculine! I have been wearing dresses when I'm with (my partner) or my friends and it makes me very happy. I understand this may be confusing, so I'll do my best to explain it!

I believe the reason I am comfortable wearing more feminine clothes now is because my body is more masculine and I'm not seen as a woman anymore. In a dress I look androgynous as opposed to before my transition where I just felt like I looked like a girl. I don't fully understand it and it's okay if you don't either! All I ask is that you accept it and respect my choices.


I've been testing out using a more neutral name with (my partner) and my friends. The name I chose is Pigeon. I know it's a strange choice but I feel like it suits me and it makes me happy. I also asked (my partner) and my friends to use singular they/them pronouns when referring to me and I'd really appreciate it if you tried to do the same. I do not mind he/him pronouns but I prefer they/them now. I understand this may take some getting used to and I'm prepared to be patient with everyone as they adjust!


I have been bottling this for some time now and I have just recently accepted it myself. I just came out to (my partner) and my friends a couple weeks ago and I didn't want to keep you in the dark.

My partner has known me for years, we've been together as a couple for eight months - also I don't date transphobes, I ask people I date if they'd have an issue dating a trans person. 

I'm not secretive about being gender queer, but I'm cautious about 'coming out' due to attitudes towards trans and nonbinary folk. If I say I'm trans the assumption from many would be that I'm a trans woman, which puts me at risk. As a gender queer or nonbinary person I worry about having to deal with the tiresome nonsense of 'Duuuh...two genders, penis and pussy!' and having to explain to people my gender. 

I do mention being queer often when replying to comments on Facebook, but now I worry that my boyfriend will see this and get confused - so I've been trying to avoid mentioning my gender identity, which leaves me feeling like I'm hiding it. 

I'd like to tell my boyfriend just so it's out there, I know he's educated enough not to take issue with the idea of nonbinary gender and I know he'll understand it makes no difference to us.
