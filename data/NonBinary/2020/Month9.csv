2020-09-01 09:39:16,ikhaav,1,1,"I'm not sure why, but I want to talk about how I learned who I am.

It's a long story, as I'm very old, and I'm not sure if it, or I, belong here. As there isn't a sub called ""a little bit trans* which is how I thought of myself for a long time, you're stuck with me for now.

I've flaired as ""support* but actually I'm mostly good and happy these days.

I don't expect any replies or answers, I just want to tell me story.

I'll start in the mid seventies. I was maybe 6 when my parents split up, and my stepfather had some odd ideas about parenting. He wasn't hugely pleased that I was around. His adult children had left home, and that suited him.

It started, ridiculously, with shampoo.

My hair was washed in fairy liquid. He had an anti dandruff shampoo which nearly blinded me, so I got what was available from the kitchen sink.

I hated having my hair washed. It was greasy and horrid and stung my eyes, and I asked my mum why I couldn't use her shampoo, but she said it was special.

If I was alone in the bathroom I'd open all the bottles she had and smell them. Shampoo that smelt like flowers, conditioner that was rich and smooth, and all sorts of other gorgeous things. Toner, lotions, foundation- I couldn't understand why I couldn't have nice things like that.

If I was sick, my stepfather and mum would go to work, and leave me in bed with squash and comics. I learned to live those days.

Is count to 100 after the door closed, and slip out of bed and go to the bathroom.

I'd smell the gorgeous things on there, pouring a little at a time on my hands to feel and smell it.

I'd look in the mirror, and wonder what id look like with long hair, or would I be brave enough to try some lipstick?

Eventually one day I put a little in the back of my hand, to work out how to remove it safely. I kept it on until it was almost time for mum to come home, lying in bed, reading, and thinking about the taste and feeling of it.

I was jealous. So jealous, all these pretty things that I was told were expensive and for big girls, not little boys.

Maybe mum suspected, but one day all these things vanished. I found them in her room, in a box in the wardrobe, and waited until I had a cold again.

That day I snuck in, and tried to really carefully pull the box out. The rest of the wardrobe was a wonder. There was a long dress, in a sort of gold satin. It still had the tags on, so I suppose it had just been consigned to the back of the pile, maybe the wrong size.

I put it on, over my Paddington pyjamas. It felt so pretty, but it trailed on the ground.

I went downstairs, turned on the TV, and drank my squash watching some sort of educational program while I waited for lunchtime TV to start.

Maybe I fell asleep, maybe I wanted to be caught.

I woke up, and mum was going mad. Crying, calling me a thief, telling me that she was ashamed of me.

So basically, I am AMAB (21), and for the longest time I’ve always thought I was a typical straight, cisgender man. But I’ve had little moments of questioning my identity for the past year or so, and after recently realizing my bisexuality, my issues with gender are coming to a boil.

I think it all started when I dyed my hair pink. I had never dyed my hair before, and while I just like pink as a color, I knew in my mind that part of the reason for going pink is because it was so feminine, and in the two months since I did it I have fallen in love with the look. From there I tried black nail polish, admittedly not super feminine, but now I love that too and wear it as often as I can. So far I know these things don’t make me *not* a man, but now my urge to explore my gender presentation is stronger than ever. Everyday I fantasize about trying on eyeshadow, and clear lip gloss, and putting flowers in my hair and even wearing a skirt, and these things make me feel more like myself than ever before. But at the same time, I still like a lot of my male clothes and signifiers, and have no desire to discard that aspect of myself.

Alright, here is my main hang up: I don’t know if these desires and modes of expression are just fashion choices or if they actually reflect my gender identity. I know that expression does NOT equal identity and I’ve told myself this over and over, but when I picture myself, the ideal version of myself both with and without these feminine signifiers…..I’m not sure if I really see myself as a man anymore. I don’t see myself as a woman, because as I said I’m still fine with my male body. Plus, I’m still okay with being perceived as a man in some respects, but other times I’m not okay with it. I’ve looked into genderfluid, and I think that somewhat describes me lately.

At the same time, I don’t feel comfortable labeling myself nonbinary yet because of fears that this is just a phase, or that I just want to feel special by not being a cis guy or that my identity isn’t valid if I haven’t experienced any grief or turmoil over it. Not to mention the pressure of worrying about friends/family accepting it.

Here are some questions that I would love to hear your answers for: 

What is the difference between being a GNC man and being a nonbinary person? 

Is it okay to label myself as nonbinary despite a lack of gender dysphoria? 

Is being a nonbinary man a valid identity?

2020-09-01 22:36:47,ikulzs,4,1,"I posted this in relationship advice but I wanna post it and get opinions here too...

So my girlfriend (20) and myself (19) got into a massive argument the other night because I was talking to her about getting top surgery. Some context to this, I am non-binary, use they/them pronouns and have been with my girlfriend for 7 months. When we were about 2 months into our relationship, I came out to her as non-binary, something I have been thinking about for years, but didn't know enough about transgender and non-binary information to give myself the label. I was only about a month or so into my relationship with her when I really figured it out.

I've spoken to her before about getting either full top surgery or reduction, and she's just kind of brushed off the topic and moved on. I spoke to her first of all about changing my name which she knew I wanted to do, and she was originally fully supportive of it, but then when I brought up my name change she started mocking me and telling me it was an awful name and giving me more feminine names, that I told her was an absolute no. We kind of stopped talking until we messaged each other saying goodnight and left it. The next day was even worse however, because she messaged me saying that I seemed off and I wasn't texting her like normal. In her defence, I did get a bit angry and went on to tell her how I text her every morning and night without fail and constantly message her through the day, but haven't really had any responses.

She responded saying that she was anxious to talk to me and her anxiety was getting to her. I asked what she was so anxious and she said she was scared of me getting top surgery. Her reasoning for this was ""what if I don't find you attractive anymore"". I was worried that she might say something like this, and I have been worried about her only really being attracted to my chest for a while as there is so many situations where she's just focused entirely on my chest. There's even been times when we're talking and I've caught her not even looking at me properly, but at my chest. I continued talking to her and she kept saying that she might not be attracted to me if I get rid of them. No matter how much I told her that nothing else about me was going to be changing, except maybe a haircut every now and then, she kept saying she was just worried that she wouldn't be attracted to me. But she said she wouldn't know until I had surgery.

This issue I have is that I have yet to even be on the Gender Identity Clinic radars, and then there's at least a two to three year wait just for an appointment. So I said to her that was there any point in us carrying on in our relationship if we might just end up breaking up because I get rid of my chest in a few years? She then started telling me I was breaking her heart and was selfish for putting the decision all on her. I ended up not messaging her anymore, but it's been a couple of days and she is acting as if nothing has even happened.

2020-09-01 22:57:09,ikuyly,1,1,"Hi everyone

I'm going to meet my partner's father soon. He seems like a high-standards upper class guy, from everything that I've come to know about him. He doesn't know much about LGBTQIA+ things and until now he has no idea what gender I have (nonbinary). My partner has avoided the topic by calling me his ""partnerhuman"" until now (which I am very comfortable with) and avoiding phrases that require using my pronouns. I am glad because I hate confrontations. All of that will probably happen when I meet the father. My partner always corrects my pronouns when he hears someone use the wrong ones. Thing is, I have good cis passing but am very uncomfortable presenting as cis. It's not an option. And when the father asks about why I use different pronouns we/I will have to explain. And I can't. I cannot explain to a cis person, what it's like to be trans - especially nonbinary. Most seem to assume than if they had different bodies they would be okay being assigned a different gender than they identify with now. I don't know if that's the case, but being nonbinary has nothing to do with my body for me. I would love to be more androgynous so people can't recognise what gender I was assigned at birth, but at the moment, that's not an option.
How can I not panic and explain to other people? How do I explain why it is important that I am not referred to as woman/man and only with my correct pronouns (English they, German es). Truth is, although I only know being trans is possible since about 5 years and nonbinary 3 years, I have always been gender nonconforming. I just thought it was medically relevant and didn't understand why gendered bathrooms etc. exist. Never knew why names, nursery colours, gender-reveals were important. No one throws a lefty-or-righty party when finding out what a kid's dominant hand is. And how is it even determined, who's left- or righthanded? Being ambidextrous is difficult in that context to.

2020-09-02 03:13:34,ikz2de,2,1,"Hello! So I don’t know if I am non-binary. I wouldn’t say it bothers me when people refer to me as my birth gender, but I definitely notice when they do, if that makes sense. Whenever I refer to myself as my birth gender, it is always conscious— that is, I ‘hear’ the pronouns, and I notice when I say or write them. I understand the value of things like “girl power,” but It’s never made me feel empowered, and I was the classic “”tomboy”” all through my youth— up until I started attending public school in grade six and wanted to fit in. 

I used to try to always refer to myself strictly by my name, or with gender neutral pronouns, or I just tried to avoid pronouns altogether... but I stopped trying a year or two ago. I don’t want to attempt to explain to others what I don’t really understand myself, I don’t want my confusion to be a part of my identity to others, and I don’t want to detract from the value of using genderless pronouns for people who know their identity and are constantly struggling to pass in the world. I have been “questioning” for far too long for that to be an acceptable excuse, I feel.

There was a period of about a year where I presented in a more gender neutral way, and I liked it, but I don’t mind dressing according to my birth gender either. The problem is, I don’t know if it actually has anything to do with gender, or if my feelings towards presentation are strictly aesthetic-based. I am not bad looking, and I believe in pretty privilege. When I presented more neutrally and cut my hair and bound my chest with sports bras, I noticed the decrease in attention. Fewer people glancing my way as I walked through the mall, fewer flirtatious gestures from confident boys at parties, etc. I feel I am more conventionally “attractive” when presenting as my birth gender, and it makes my life noticeably easier. I don’t think I am ready to lose all of that. I don’t feel like presentation has helped me understand my gender, because I don’t identify with clothing styles. I am just dressing my body based on what looks good— like a doll; I am not dressing me. 

The problem is I want top surgery. I’ve wanted it for years. I long to touch my chest and feel the warmth of my hand on my ribcage. I daydream about wearing loose jerseys with nothing underneath and feeling the cool breeze on my skin...

But I haven’t taken this fantasy any farther, because it means explaining myself to relatives, and because I fear I might regret it since I do not know if I am non-binary.

I’ve worked hard to practice self-love and self-acceptance. I’ve grown out of the excessive angst that plagued me in my youth. I’m not depressed anymore, and I am mentally stable, but these little negging feelings and thoughts have just never gone away. It doesn’t hurt me to be referred to as my birth gender. I don’t ‘hate’ my chest, but I don’t want to live with it. Does this mean I don’t have dysphoria? I don’t like identifying with labels for anything— not my diet nor my sexuality, but if I am going to seriously consider a severely traumatic and permanent surgery like top surgery... I just think I should be more sure.

Ok so I have been thinking about this ever since I found out I was nonbinary and I might still need more time to think about this cause a name change is a HUGE responsibility and I’m very indecisive.

2020-09-02 09:01:42,il3cix,12,1,"Alright, so hi :)

I’m a closeted enby at home, but online I’m me. Some friends irl know me as Fox, but for the most part, I’m closeted. For the past few weeks, I’ve been hyping myself up to hopefully come out to my family as soon as I can. I have seven siblings and live with 6 of them, and my parents. None of my family knows much about LGBTQIA+ topics, and I usually just try to listen when I hear anything related (so I know their viewpoints and I’ll know if I’m safe or not to come out). I’m young, in high school, and I know I’ll be with my family for a few more years. I don’t want to make a mistake and come out too early if I won’t be safe.

Nobody in my family has ever even met an openly queer person and for the most part have no opinion on any of it. So far, my experience with anything I’ve overheard them say about any form of LGBTQIA+ has been accepting and nice. I thought I’d be safe. I got super psyched to come out to my parents today, so I walked into their room. They were in the middle of a conversation with one of my brothers, this is what I heard:

**Mom: I’ve been a mom for \*22 years\***

**Dad: (mockingly) “I’ve been a mom for 22 years”**

**I, jokingly, said: Whoa, you’ve been a mom for 22 years? (Looking at dad)**

**Dad: Yeah! I’m a man who identifies as a mom. What’s that called? (He had a big smile on his face, looked like he was trying to hold in a laugh)**

**Me: I dunno, a \*preferred term?\***

**Dad: (Kind of chuckled a bit) People just identify as whatever now, don’t they?**

**My brother chimes in: Haha, like those special unicorns?**

**Dad: Yeah, and \*pansexuals?\* (struggling to say it, like holy shit it’s not that hard) What is that?**

**Mom: Too many useless terms and over-sensitivity, (looking over at me, calls me my birth name). That’s all it is. I mean, I’m okay with it, \*up to a point,\* just don’t go making up new things to \*identify as.\***

So, I walked away. I don’t feel like I’ll be safe anymore. I had a breakdown a while ago, thinking: “What if they don’t really love me unconditionally? What if I come out and find out it is just conditional love?” -And I had that breakdown again. I mean, I’m not that close to my family, we rarely talk just because I’m a terrified, socially-awkward, anxious, queer teen. But, still. I need support, I need that familial love. If I come out, or if I’m outed, and they make fun of me constantly, my mental health is gonna be worse than it already is. On top of all this, after that situation, they were talking to each other about AFAB trans\* teens and binding (Something I need to do for dysphoria). They were talking to each other, and I didn’t get involved, but I listened. “Why do that? Why compress your chest down and break ribs, not be able to breathe, just to be something fake?”

I honestly thought before all of this that they’d be accepting. I’m so scared of what my mental health is gonna go to over the next few years living at home.

has anyone else been raised in an extremely conservative christian house? (part of it was also abuse for years from my father, who was a pastor) 
i know i’ll never be able to be openly nonbinary or bi, i have two sisters that are also lgbtq+ that i’m sort of out to, but we all keep it kind of hidden away? like i’ll tell people i trust that i’m bi, but i don’t think i’d ever be able to have a same sex relationship no matter how much i want to.
even if the majority of our family wouldn’t say anything, (my dad is out of the picture) the shame and fear from being taught from a young age that “people like that” are an abomination and are going to hell, or should be killed,  it’s hard to shake deep down. especially when you add 16 years of physical/mental abuse.
so ANYWAYS
i was wondering if anyone here had any advice about over coming religious trauma and not having that guilt “you’re walking away from God and going to hell” always in the back of your mind?

I don’t want this conversation to diminish the wonderful and urgent work of activists pushing for pronoun inclusivity. But if pronouns are inextricably linked to gender and are always going to reflect gender, then I don’t want them. I guess this is probably common among agender folks. The hold-up for me is that pronouns (neutral, neo, binary) are soooo common in language. So to simply not use them might be more work than to use neutral pronouns. In a sense, we’re always burdened with this gender pronoun obstacle not bc we ask to be referred in a different way, but because society pushes back against anything outside of the binary. 

It’s just so frustrating. For me, gender isn’t much of an aspect of my life. I don’t refer to myself as a gender really. I know other people do and that’s fantastic. It’s just hard to sort through this area when pronouns are often posited as reflective of something. For me, they don’t reflect anything more than a language short cut for my name.

2020-09-03 21:05:01,im27op,0,1,"I'm kind of questioning being a demiboy but I haven't really reached a conclusion. All I know is that I don't like my gender a lot and I sometimes get a bit sad thinking that it's likely I'll always be female.

Most girls look up to/want to be like famous women and models and whatnot. I always favourite/want to be like male characters and it sometimes makes me sad that I won't ever look like/be like that.

I don't like my female attributes like hips and high voice. Speaking in a deeper voice just makes me look weird and feel out of place.

Sometimes I feel a bit isolated by other females (probably) because I act more masculine than them.

2020-09-04 02:13:03,im7d1d,7,1,"Hi, hopefully this doesn't come across as controversial or offensive, but I would really like the community's opinions on mine (I'm here to learn!!)

There has been a lot of push to encourage people to state their pronouns when introducing themselves. I understand why people think it's important to normalize sharing pronouns and not assuming someone's preferred gender. But personally I am not super comfortable with introducing myself with my pronouns, because of sexism / how the different genders are (subconsciously and consciously) treated in society.

I identify as female and I am uncomfortable with outright stating that (even though it is quite evident from my appearance and I do not consider myself to be a part of the LGBTQ community) because I think it puts an emphasis on my gender - which is not an important part of my identity. I do not like being treated as a female just because I'm a female (I hope that makes sense), and all the social expectations that come with being labeled as a female.

I don't think anyone would mistake me for a male (or not female), but in my ideal world, gender would literally not exist at all and not matter at all (except if you were looking to have a child with someone but that's more about sex rather than gender). Meaning, I think certain actions, appearances, behavior, etc. should not be associated with any gender. But obviously eliminating the concept of gender is impossible, especially with our society and the English language.

I do not get offended if someone misgenders me (I have a cultural name so I have been addressed as Mr quite often in email correspondence, and when I was younger quite a lot of people thought I was a boy from my appearance/behavior), and would honestly prefer it if people didn't know what my gender was. Ultimately, I do not really want to be outright associated with a certain gender, but considering myself to be agender would be incorrect.

And I'd like to point out - a lot of parents choose to name their daughters with a gender-neutral name to avoid gender biases as much as possible - so wouldn't stating your gender be defeating the purpose?

I just don't see the need to emphasize the fact that I identify as female, and I think identifying myself as agender/gender-fluid (which I don't think I am?) would draw more emphasis to my gender, which, is something I wish people would not consider at all.

I always knew my mom was bisexual, but it wasn't until my late teens that I learned they were nonbinary and identified as neither male or female. I always knew I had a masculine ""tomboy"" mom and so it wasn't a big shock to me or anything. They said that I could still use ""mom"" and ""mother"" terms and so my brothers and I didn't have much of readjusting to do. My mom didn't really learn about names for gender identities until adulthood, or else my brothers and I would probably have learned about them being nonbinary sooner.

Since coming out, our relationship has been full of crying and fights and insecurities and we both feel like teenagers again in a bad way. They are starting therapy soon, and I have been in therapy since November. With quarantine (we are in the US), I’ve been feeling profoundly socially isolated and pings of suicidal feelings. They say they feel similar. We both are back to work with no permit-able social life. This was variable before we went back to work and before we came out to each other, but now I feel insane.

I’m so tired and so lost. I have nobody in IRL I can talk to. I’ve asked in the past if they would do couples therapy and they say no. The criticisms never end.

I think all of this tension is just because they feel out of control. They’re a musician who had a pretty great tour booked right before this hit. They haven’t come out to any more people besides me and one friend.

2020-09-04 17:30:00,imkbsj,9,1,"I have noticed that most people here tend to believe either that ""gender is a spectrum"" or that ""gender doesn't exist"". Would somebody be willing to explain to me what ""gender doesn't exist"" mean? 



As a quick background, I have only seen this used before when I first started learning more about gender identities, and that was by transphobes. My journey was complicated at best, I ended up almost killing myself. I associate this stance with something painful and, because of this, I basically run away anytime I hear it, afraid of being brought back to the dark place I've been before.



I want to understand, but I'm afraid that trying to research it will bring me to transphobic articles/sites. I know I should research it myself, it's probably something easy to do, but all I can think of are things such as: ""gender doesn't exist/is made up, there is only sex, therefore you are female/a woman and that's what you'll ever be"", ""you just want attention, you're not special, you're a woman"", ""you're a mentally ill female"", ""oh look, another one of the 'I'm not like the other girls' type, get over yourself"", and so on. 



I'm having a hard time even writing this, because for me the idea of gender existing is what gives me the possibility to be me, to be not a woman. Taking gender away, takes that away too, it means I am a woman and this feels so wrong, makes me want to claw at my skin, to destroy myself, because if there is no me left then at least there is also nobody left to be a woman.



The way I see things, there is sex (female, male, intersex) based on our bodies; gender identity (woman, man, nonbinary) based on how we see or feel about ourselves/ what goes in our heads; and gender expression (feminine, masculine, androgynous) based on our expression (such as clothes, but it is a heavily biased matter since it differs for each culture and period of time). There are also gender roles but those are shit, nobody should be expected or, even more, forced to do anything based on whether they were born with a vagina or a penis.



I hope I'm not offending anyone, please tell me if I should change something about the way I worded things, or even delete the post (I don't want to make anybody uncomfortable).

2020-09-05 04:35:27,imv1t7,6,1,"Hey everyone. I wanted to just get some feelings off my chest and bounce thoughts off of y’all, since I figure you guys know more about gender identity than I do.

For context: I’ve been questioning my gender ever since I started puberty. I’m AFAB, but I’ve never really felt a connection to my gender. As a child I embraced femininity, but I don’t think it was for any particular reason... it was just what was expected of me. I started to dig deeper into gender identity when I hit puberty and tried to figure out what I was feeling.

An important thing to note: about 2-3 years after I started puberty, I came out as asexual. I never felt sexual attraction to anyone and I was (and still am) very sex-repulsed. I am heteromantic, but don’t really consider physical appearance or sexual appeal in any of my relationships or friendships.

Back when I was in my tumultuous pubescent period, I was very confused about my appearance, how I present, what I wore, and how others saw me. Nothing traumatic happened that made me dress conservatively. I just couldn’t stand being viewed in a feminine manner *at all*, whether it was the risk of having a non-crew neckline, wearing shorts that are slightly too high, or anything. My ideal outfit is a big t-shirt and some loose pants with lots of pockets.

I feel completely detached from my female sex &amp; gender. I hate my reproductive organs. If I could get rid of them, I would. In my experience, the only thing boobs are good for are catching crumbs. It all gets in the way and it makes me mad that I have to spend money to maintain these organs that I don’t even need nor ever plan to use.

At the same time, I’m heavily averse to anything feminine. I think some of it stems from the anxiety I felt back then of not being listened to by my family about how I felt. I hated the female side of myself. Nowadays, I feel absolutely no connection to it and I try not to present in any feminine manner possible. I don’t want people viewing me like that because that’s not who I am, and I’m uncomfortable being viewed in a femininely sexual manner (sex-repulsed ace moment).

Still, I don’t think I identify as a man. I wouldn’t trade my female organs for male ones... I just, wouldn’t want *any* at all. I might look at getting a binder, but I don’t know that I want to go on T or anything. I feel way more comfortable *presenting* masculine, as it feels closer to my inner self, but I don’t consider it my true self or anything. It just makes me feel more secure and less vulnerable, especially in public.

When I am financially independent I’m absolutely going to revamp my clothing selection. Button up shirts, baggy pants, cargos, t-shirts, beanies, nothing feminine ever again. No more long hair, something short and messy and low-maintenance. I know that’s not who I am. But I don’t know who I am. Or what I am.

Sorry. This is kinda long. I don’t know what to flair this. Basically, I’m asking what y’all think of how I feel... did you go through anything similar? Do you think some parts I mentioned are characteristic of one identity or another? I feel like agender and/or transmasc might be a place to start, but I’m not sure. I know that it’s not always “right” to latch onto a label, but honestly, I *need* direction right now. I’ve been questioning for 6+ years and have no idea what I’m doing. I might delete this later since some people I know irl know my account, but we’ll see.

I feel way more comfortable *presenting* masculine, as it feels closer to my inner self, but I don’t consider it my true self or anything. It just makes me feel more secure and less vulnerable, especially in public.\n\nWhen I am financially independent I’m absolutely going to revamp my clothing selection. Button up shirts, baggy pants, cargos, t-shirts, beanies, nothing feminine ever again. No more long hair, something short and messy and low-maintenance. I know that’s not who I am. But I don’t know who I am. Or what I am.\n\nSorry. This is kinda long. I don’t know what to flair this. Basically, I’m asking what y’all think of how I feel... did you go through anything similar? Do you think some parts I mentioned are characteristic of one identity or another? I feel like agender and/or transmasc might be a place to start, but I’m not sure. I know that it’s not always “right” to latch onto a label, but honestly, I *need* direction right now. I’ve been questioning for 6+ years and have no idea what I’m doing. I might delete this later since some people I know irl know my account, but we’ll see.

In March of 2019 I came out to my family as gay because I thought that’s what made the most sense at the time. I knew I liked girls but I also still liked dressing more masculine, I told my self that I can’t be straight if I wanted to dress more like a guy typically would, no guy would ever want me. I knew deep down being gay wasn’t really the right label but I just wanted to fit in somewhere so badly and just make my self stop agonizing over this. So with the idea that I was a lesbian and it was okay that I dressed more masculine because I’m a tomboy or a butch, it was enough to make me not suicidal for a while.

He told me about what identifying as non-binary was and something just clicked. It made sense, it felt like a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders. I realized that I don’t really feel comfortable identifying fully as a female or a male but identifying as somewhere in between those two was where I felt most myself.

2020-09-06 15:05:27,inniq3,4,1,"Hi friends,

I'm (nb, AFAB) heading back to school in a week. I study massage therapy. For those who don't know, for the first year, massage therapy students learn using each other as ""patients."" It's... awful? This term we will be learning massage techniques for ""sensitive areas"" -- upper inner thigh, buttocks, and breasts. 

I need to figure out how to handle this. So far my plan is thus:

\*remind myself that I'm doing this because there aren't enough trans and non-binary people in health care, and almost none that I can find who do body work. 

\*Come out as non-binary to my class (lord have mercy), and start using they/them pronouns

\*acquire chest binder (I've done this part already)

\*Figure out some way to minimize the appearance of my hips?

The last part I need help with. There's not much I can do about it when I'm on the table, or when we do assessments in class that require me to stand in bike shorts and a sports bra in front of my classmates and profs... but if I can look a little less feminine when I'm not nearly nude, I might feel better about it. I've been working on mascing-up my presentation over the lockdown, but I can't figure out how to make my hips less obvious without, you know, starving? I've struggled with anorexia in the past (4 years stable weight, yay me!), but the fact remains that starving is the easiest, cheapest, most socially acceptable, most accessible way to make my body into one that doesn't have hips, breasts, or a menstrual cycle. Obviously it's not a good option for my health, but right now it's just tempting as hell. 

I don't want a medical transition. I'm not a man. I don't want T. I just want \*not\* E. 

Can anyone relate? Does anyone have advice? Words of encouragement? A little affirmation? I'm terrified of this year, but I'm determined to do it and survive.",NonBinary,Non-binary massage therapy student desperately needs your help to masc-up their presentation!

Hi everyone! I have been a part of online LGBTQ+ spaces for a while, leading to my interest in how technology can help people who are exploring/questioning/thinking about their identity. And now I happen to be studying this, especially with respect to gender :) 

I'm a PhD student at UCL in human-computer interaction, and am running an anonymous 10-15 minute survey about this - specifically about if and how you've used social media, other websites, apps and video games, and ideally what technology should offer to support identity exploration. If you are over 18 and consider yourself to have thought about/questioned your gender identity and/or explored aspects of this using tech (*regardless* of your identity now), and would like to share your thoughts, I would really appreciate you filling in this survey if you're interested. Thank you!

2020-09-07 18:09:04,iocn5o,1,1,"This is mostly just me venting, but I guess also looking for advice.

I was really hopeful when recently the rule of having to select a binary gender marker for your passport was brought up in court under the question of being unlawful that it might result in change. We all know how that turned out. I've managed to apply for a new driving licence in my new name because those don't require any sort of gender marker (literally what's the point in having one on any form of photo ID, you just look at the picture and make sure it looks like the person, no?) but applying for a passport has been the biggest pain in my ass.

Aside from the problems covid has caused with shutting down the passport applications etc, I am so fed up with all the bullshit bureaucracy we have to jump through to ""prove"" every little thing to people. And even when I do all of it, even when I can show them that I'm not making this up for kicks and I really do use that name and that title (though why are they even making me state a title when it isn't on the passport anyway??), at the end of the day, I *still* have to pick a box to check. Am I an M or an F. How the fuck am I supposed to know. Why the fuck do *you* need to know. All I want is this bit of paper that lets me go see my partner in another country.

I'm in two minds about continuing the application at all. I want to get it updated soon so that I can have a photo that actually looks like me, and a name that doesn't make me cringe that I can write on my flight tickets when I go see my partner (hopefully before the end of the year, but who knows). But, I also haven't lost hope that the rules will change. People are still fighting for this to change, for them to recognise that not everybody is an M or an F either by adding an X (which I have plenty of other issues with but at least for now it wouldn't feel like I'm lying to the world and hiding who I am), or by getting rid of the gender marker entirely (much, much less likely to happen anytime soon).

So for the advice part, if anybody has any; should I bother applying for a passport just now, when it still won't be accurate? Especially when it's possible that they'll change the system in a somewhat bearable time frame and I'd be tempted to update it again, which would waste another £75 that I really *really* shouldn't be wasting on changing a letter? And if I do get it now, since both of these letters are wrong and uncomfortable, how do I know which one to tick? Do I just stick with the one on my old passport because it's less evidence to provide, or go with the other because it matches better with my new name and would make me less uncomfortable to be misgendered in that direction?

2020-09-08 03:51:52,iommlt,1,1,"hi hello this is my first time posting on this sub.

i started my journey years ago when i met a trans woman and realized i had dysphoria. i thought i was a trans woman until a year later when, because of dissociation, i kinda thought i was agender or genderfluid but really i just was so depressed i couldn't maintain a picture of who i was in my head.

when that got better i thought i was a trans woman again. which lasted like 2 1/2 years until last december, when i happened to describe myself as transfeminine rather than as a trans woman and got a jolt of gender euphoria from it. i questioned for months and months before a trans artist i follow had his transfeminine character (a character i already related to a lot) come out as nonbinary and it was like a sign like! it's okay!!

so i finally accepted that im nonbinary. but i still feel really attached to womanhood like i was sure im still a woman, so bigender i guess. i still like calling myself a girl, i want people to see me as a girl, i want to see a girl in the mirror. but ive had this thought stuck in my that maybe im not a girl. ive started thinking sometimes that im not a girl and it makes me happy. but i still also love saying that i am a girl...so basically im back to questioning my gender some more lol. there are so many layers!! (see i tied it back to the shrek reference dont worry).

i guess the moral of the story is that i've been at this for 6 years, i know basically everything about the transfeminine experience and a bit about the transmasculine one, i know all sorts of different theories of gender... and im still questioning things. whoever you are, dear reader, it's okay to not have everything figured out.",NonBinary,gender is like ogres,1599562312.0,"{'created_utc': 1599537112, 'id': 'iommlt', 'num_comments': 1, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""hi hello this is my first time posting on this sub.\n\ni started my journey years ago when i met a trans woman and realized i had dysphoria. i thought i was a trans woman until a year later when, because of dissociation, i kinda thought i was agender or genderfluid but really i just was so depressed i couldn't maintain a picture of who i was in my head.\n\nwhen that got better i thought i was a trans woman again. which lasted like 2 1/2 years until last december, when i happened to describe myself as transfeminine rather than as a trans woman and got a jolt of gender euphoria from it. i questioned for months and months before a trans artist i follow had his transfeminine character (a character i already related to a lot) come out as nonbinary and it was like a sign like! it's okay!!\n\nso i finally accepted that im nonbinary. but i still feel really attached to womanhood like i was sure im still a woman, so bigender i guess. i still like calling myself a girl, i want people to see me as a girl, i want to see a girl in the mirror. but ive had this thought stuck in my that maybe im not a girl. ive started thinking sometimes that im not a girl and it makes me happy. but i still also love saying that i am a girl...so basically im back to questioning my gender some more lol. there are so many layers!!

Whenever I wore particularly feminine outfits, I felt like I was wearing a costume rather than just normal clothes. Since I’ve realized I’m non-binary I’ve cut my hair, wear bras that compressed my boobs more, and wear more masculine clothing sometimes.

So I came out about 20 months ago, now, and I've begun going by names that I feel better represent me as NB. Since I felt like my name wasn't WRONG, just gendering, I kinda just... sawed off the gendering parts... I guess...   


I've slowly been telling people my new name and asking them to use it. The only person I haven't been insistent on using it once I've told them is my mom.

I was almost disappointed that he didn't go nuts because that would have made one hell of a story. Despite this he did say some anti LGBTQ stuff like, ""I'm sad that your not normal.""

But the story doesn't end there. Today my dad overheard me muttering to myself that Chrsitianity is a religion of hate. From being raised in a homophobic family to getting mindrapped at a worship night at a youth group retreat, I have very negative experiences with religion.

 We had an argument on religion and he thinks that its good when people cry out to God and release their negative emotions through tears in worship. My dad also displayed homophobic behavior by talking about gender norms, asking why the LGBTQ  advertise the way they are like  by wearing pride apparel, and thinks that gay people are attacking Christians when, calling the LGBTQ abnormal behavior and so on. Funny thing is he and the entire family claim not to be homophibic, even going as far to claim he has had gay friends.  

I told my dad why he thinks its wrong if I wear pride bracelets when my family advertises their faith all the time.

I can't go to stores right now to try on clothing because of being an immunosuppressed person in the times of COVID so have been having to do all my clothing shopping online. 

So quick sizing question for my fellow AFABs

For men's pants sizing should I go with my waste measurement or should I go up a size or two to account for my hips? 

It should be farely obvious but I'm having a hard time figuring it out and don't want to have to deal with returns.

I didn't have children simply because I wanted a carbon copy of myself, nor do I have any need to ""carry on the family line."" And they choose gender-neutral. 

My biggest problem is nomenclature. And it's two-fold:

1) I spent many years of my career as a line editor. Using they/them where it does not match the singular form is very confusing to my brain, and way more confusing to others, when they can't figure out to whom I am referring.

2) I spent even more years referring to my offspring by the pronoun that was ""assigned"" by birth. So I slip up. I try not to slip, but it's inevitable.

There's not one decent word to use when talking about this person to others.

I can't really say ""my child,"" or ""my kid,"" since they're a full grown adult. There isn't a gender neutral word (that I know of) to replace ""my son,"" or ""my daughter.""

""My offspring"" sounds totally weird. For a while we were going with ""my spawn,"" but not seriously. 

I know that in the not so distant future (if we haven't killed off the human race by then), there will be fully accepted words as part of our standard vocabulary. And this era is where we'll be making those decisions, as a society. 

So right now, and for now, I am trying to crowd source ideas of words to use. Any assistance will be greatly appreciated, not to mention possibly planting the seeds of vocabulary for the future.

2020-09-11 16:50:14,iquatg,7,1,"Hey everyone, so I'm not non-binary but I need some advice. Sorry this is gonna be a bit long.

I (24M) just moved to a new city about a year ago. Back in my old home, there was this person named Mary (25NB) who I used to see at parties sometimes, or at school. They were cool and everything but I never really thought much of them, we were kinda in different friend groups with not too much overlap, but I thought they were cute and we would kinda flirt when we talked. But again, this was rare. They graduated before me, and I finished school and moved on to this new place. 

But recently they moved to the same city as me (they aren't too far away from each other but far away enough that there aren't many others from my school who wound up here) and wanted to hang out. It's a smaller city, so I was kinda desperate to make friends, plus I hadn't seen them in a while and they were fun to be around. We hung out a few times, and I realized... I was quickly getting feelings for them. Now I would describe myself as straight and cisgender (just learned that second word so let me know if that's not right) but anyway I've only ever been with girls and that's okay. But Mary isn't a girl, and is very different from any girl I've met. They're SUPER androgynous, to the point where I thought they were a boy the first time met them, and that's only gotten more intense with time. Short hair, a sturdy frame, with broad shoulders and small breasts, stocky and short. Not at all my type, but I was slowly realizing how little I cared about body type.

Anyway, after a few months of hanging out and suffering in silence, they came over one day to watch TV with me. It was all normal, but we started getting closer and closer. I was sweating and my heart was trying to escape my chest by means of physic violence, because I really didn't want to fuck it up. We ended up looking at each other, I mustered the courage to ask if I could kiss them, they said yes. Soon we're making out and they're on top of me. It's crazy.

But then things get kinda weird. I ask if I can touch them under their shirt, and they say yes. But I've only ever been with women before, so I stupidly grab their breast first thing, and they quickly pulled my hand away. I sorta backed off for a moment thinking I was moving too fast (which I probably was), but then as it was getting more intense I grabbed their hips, and they moved my hand again. So I gave up on trying to move things along. We made out for a little while, and then they went home.

Okay that might have been too much detail. But I think I just don't know how to touch or engage intimately with someone who isn't a girl, or someone who sees their body in a different way. I REALLY like them, so much that I've done a bunch of research into Nonbinary things (I also think I might be non binary myself but that's a post for a different day lol). I bet the right thing is to ask them what they're comfortable with, and I definitely will, but I also want some advice. What's the best way to approach this?

Like many, my family is less than understanding of my gender identity (as NB). I have a hard time giving them an explanation that they don't try to pick apart. In fact, the first thing they said was that by saying that I am enby, I am just playing into binary gender norms.

I want to hear people's stories and explanations. We are all creative, intelligent people and have our own valid reasons for being ourselves, especially if the answer to the question is just that 'it feels right'.

As for myself, I met a fellow enby and realized that not having a gender was the freedom I wanted all along. Growing up, I wanted to play sports, share my thoughts, and look damn good while doing it but where I lived made that very difficult. As a child, my parents would hide flyers for certain activities from me so I was never exposed to non-stereotypical activities for my presumed gender.

NB is a broad category that covers a lot of different viewpoints. I want to present as androgynous with an emphasis on being competent and capable instead of having a gender. Being called male or female just doesn't feel right. I'm pansexual and love and appreciate all types of sexual organs. And if I feel this way, it can't be wrong or unnatural.

CW: Transphobia?  
So, I'm an AMAB genderqueer. I feel like I'd like to do hrt to look more androginous/grow breasts, but I don't want to fully transition to a female-looking body, is that something that can be done? Like, can I start treatment and then stop taking it once I'm satisfied with how I look?

  
Also, I'm a little conflicted about this desire... I'm scared that if I start treatment, I'd be subjecting myself to get clocked... Right now, depending on the situation I can pass as a cis/effeminate boy if need be. One of my life goals is to live on the road, doing bike tours for a couple of years, but I'm afraid of hateful response, for example, in rural less-progressive areas of my country, or if I ever got to visit certain parts of europe, I feel like I could be the target of physical violence.  

And even without the element of travelling, would transitioning make my life overly political? Maybe I'd have to defend my right to exist in a weekly/daily basis and I don't know if I'm emotionally stable enough to handle that.

2020-09-12 20:06:45,irjq30,9,7,"So I have been dating my spouse for almost 10 years and we have been married for maybe 4. I came out to my spouse as non-binary maybe a year plus ago now and I had thought everything was going fine. He has always been super supportive and accommodating but i was still really surprised at how well he was taking it. He used my correct pronouns when talking to other people really consistently and never took me up on my offer to talk about it.

But, this past weekend we had friends over and he messed up my pronouns a lot and it was okay, everyone makes mistakes, but I still talked to him later about it because it was unexpected.

Turns out he has a hard time using my pronouns when he is “talking quickly” because he has to consciously think to use the correct ones everytime (which hats off to him for putting that work it). He admitted to still basically seeing me as a woman and is unsure if he ever will be able to change that but is trying to. We talked about how I might want to get top surgery but I am unsure but I wouldn’t want him to not love me anymore because of it and he said that I shouldn’t worry about that because I have lots of other things to love (which was really nice and helpful) and that I shouldn’t have to worry about him in my decision for my own body (but I definitely don’t think I can commit to not taking his opinion into consideration because him leaving me would really negatively impact my happiness so I would prefer to avoid it).

He said he still doesn’t understand me being non-binary. He says he doesn’t feel attached to his agab so the “I don’t feel like a man or a woman” doesn’t really click as different for him. I said I think I feel happier presenting how I have been and identifying as I have been, which he accepted but I don’t think it helped him understand. He wants to understand and consumes a lot of lgbtq media but I don’t think he connects things to me. I watch a lot of non-binary youtubers and share vids with him too. But I think it is just something that will take more time for him.

2020-09-12 20:33:08,irk77s,6,3,"I'm 28. AFAB. Openly pansexual. Hi. I'm new to exploring gender identity in general. Like, I never knew there were names for certain identities. I didn't even know being a transperson was a thing until I was maybe 19. I didn't know people could transition. I'd never heard of it before. So just let that sink in. In recent years, I've finally started looking into all that kinda stuff on my own. Basically, right now, I am trying to figure out my label. There are so many different identities out there, which objectively, I understand but I'm not exactly sure which one fits me. So here's a synopsis of me:

I grew up hating my name. First name is Mary, which I always thought was too girly. I hated it. I always went by my middle name because it's less girly, but I still didn't like it either. I was always more of a tomboy and it wasn't until I was 15 that I started to wear skirts, but it was only certain styles and I hardly wore them (mostly because I'm just more comfortable in jeans). I also always shopped both in the boys and girls clothes. I never understood why they were even separate. As a child I knew that clothes were clothes. That's it. Why did they have to be separate, and why did the girls clothes have to be more expensive? Lol. I remember as a child, I walked into a women's bathroom at a store and there was a transwoman in there, washing her hands. In my child head, I saw a man dressed as a woman (so sorry about that, I'm no longer ignorant, I promise!) but it's not like it bothered me. It was more of an acknowledgement thing. I smiled at her as I always did with strangers, I did my business, and then I left. To me, in my child head, it was perfectly acceptable for a man to wear women's clothes because I also liked to wear boy's clothes. The point of this part is that clothes in general are gender neutral to me. I don't define gender based on what someone's wearing.

However, when it comes to ""being"" a girl, I never felt that. I never wanted to be called a girl. I knew what a girl was ""supposed"" to be because I would get teased for dressing/acting like a boy. Women tend to embrace their gender. They're proud to be that gender. Men do this too. Objectively, I get it. But personally, I've never felt that. It's not that I want to. I just don't care. It's not an active part of my life or my thoughts. To me, it's like a baseball player being SUPER proud of their abilities and what they've accomplished. And I'm just over here like, ""Cool! Super happy for you! Can't relate, but nice!"" I'm not a ""baseball player"" like everyone else. It's totally unrelated to my life. (Replace ""gender identities"" with ""baseball player"" and that's my point. Lol.)

It's also not that I hate being called ""she"" (or ""he"" in A LOT of instances). I don't mind either, honestly. I don't care what pronouns are used for me. I'm just existing. I don't want my identity to be based on any gender, especially not on gender stereotypes.

I really hope this makes sense. I really hope someone out there understands EXACTLY what I'm feeling/thinking so I know I'm not just being an overcomplicated dimwit or something.

I think so?",1599967988.0,"{'created_utc': 1599942788, 'id': 'irk77s', 'num_comments': 6, 'score': 3, 'selftext': 'I\'m 28. AFAB. Openly pansexual. Hi. I\'m new to exploring gender identity in general. Like, I never knew there were names for certain identities. I didn\'t even know being a transperson was a thing until I was maybe 19. I didn\'t know people could transition. I\'d never heard of it before. So just let that sink in. In recent years, I\'ve finally started looking into all that kinda stuff on my own. Basically, right now, I am trying to figure out my label. There are so many different identities out there, which objectively, I understand but I\'m not exactly sure which one fits me. So here\'s a synopsis of me:\n\nI grew up hating my name. First name is Mary, which I always thought was too girly. I hated it. I always went by my middle name because it\'s less girly, but I still didn\'t like it either. I was always more of a tomboy and it wasn\'t until I was 15 that I started to wear skirts, but it was only certain styles and I hardly wore them (mostly because I\'m just more comfortable in jeans). I also always shopped both in the boys and girls clothes. I never understood why they were even separate. As a child I knew that clothes were clothes. That\'s it. Why did they have to be separate, and why did the girls clothes have to be more expensive? Lol. I remember as a child, I walked into a women\'s bathroom at a store and there was a transwoman in there, washing her hands. In my child head, I saw a man dressed as a woman (so sorry about that, I\'m no longer ignorant, I promise!) but it\'s not like it bothered me. It was more of an acknowledgement thing. I smiled at her as I always did with strangers, I did my business, and then I left. To me, in my child head, it was perfectly acceptable for a man to wear women\'s clothes because I also liked to wear boy\'s clothes. The point of this part is that clothes in general are gender neutral to me. I don\'t define gender based on what someone\'s wearing.\n\nHowever, when it comes to ""being"" a girl, I never felt that. I never wanted to be called a girl. I knew what a girl was ""supposed"" to be because I would get teased for dressing/acting like a boy. Women tend to embrace their gender. They\'re proud to be that gender. Men do this too. Objectively, I get it. But personally, I\'ve never felt that. It\'s not that I want to. I just don\'t care. It\'s not an active part of my life or my thoughts. To me, it\'s like a baseball player being SUPER proud of their abilities and what they\'ve accomplished. And I\'m just over here like, ""Cool! Super happy for you! Can\'t relate, but nice!"" I\'m not a ""baseball player"" like everyone else. It\'s totally unrelated to my life. (Replace ""gender identities"" with ""baseball player"" and that\'s my point. Lol.)\n\nIt\'s also not that I hate being called ""she"" (or ""he"" in A LOT of instances). I don\'t mind either, honestly. I don\'t care what pronouns are used for me. I\'m just existing. I don\'t want my identity to be based on any gender, especially not on gender stereotypes.\n\nI really hope this makes sense.

Recently, I came out to a close friend, and told her I identify as agender, which I do. She was very nice about it, and agreed to use they/them pronouns for me ( which I prefer). But, I’ve been starting to double guess myself lately. I still don’t feel like a girl nor a boy, and I still do identify as agender, but I’m afraid it’s just hormones and I’m actually just a girl that wants attention. I’ve been watching this subreddit for months, and it’s really helped me realize I’m probably non binary, but I’m still confused. 

I feel an immense happiness when I think of myself as agender, which I don’t get when I think of myself as male or female. I still refer to myself as she/her in my head though, which I have been trying to stop since I really despise being called a she. I do dress rather girly though, which I enjoy, but it just makes me more confused. I know clothing doesn’t have a gender, but I don’t know. I don’t have a gender either, I have never associated myself with any gender, but maybe I’m just overthinking it and I’m a girl? I don’t know. 

I’ve heard soooo many people online say they identified as non binary during puberty, but then realized it was just hormones and they were actually their birth gender. I’ve partially convinced myself it’s just hormones at this point, since I’m just probably experiencing what every other girl experiences. Except, none of my female friends have ever said they experience it too when I bring it up. 

I’m so scared to tell anyone else I’m close to, because I’m terrified it’s just hormones and I am actually just a girl, but I also hate being called a girl. I mean, I would rather be a girl than a boy, but I’m still not a girl. But, what if I am a girl? I know it’s probably just hormones and I’m being ridiculous and one day I’ll grow up and identify as a woman, but I don’t want to be a woman. I’m not a woman. 


And, that is why I have come here for help. My brain is fighting itself over what gender I am, and I would just really appreciate someone that has maybe experienced similar struggles to come and tell me anything that might help. I’m praying it’s not hormones, I hate being a girl, but I know I am going through some stuff right now that would make me feel differently about myself. I feel the same way I did when I realized I liked girls a few years ago, and now I accept it, and I’m hoping this is like that.
 

I have also been experiencing gender dysphoria ( don’t think I spelled that correctly) about my upper body since I started developing breasts. I wear baggy ish clothing, avoid softer fabrics, and such to try and hide them. They are too much, even though the are small and pretty unnoticeable compared to the girls in my grade.

I know that was very ranty, but I had to let it all out. I don’t want to continue to have the world see me as female, I’ve never seen myself as female. I have always just existed outside gender in my head. I never thought of myself as a girl, and I never thought of myself as a boy.

I gave her the option to use she/her or they/them (I’m afab.) she chose to continue using she/her. I told my siblings and didn’t get too much of a reaction from my at the time, 15 year old brother.

Everything has been fine up until recently. I decided to change my name and go by they/them pronouns. My sister and boyfriend are so so supportive. Other people that have been respectful are some of my boyfriends friends, people I know at school, professors and my boyfriends grandmother. My step father says this whole situation reeks of insecurity, my brother said I was being weird and a snowflake for getting upset with my stepdads “jokes.” My mom hasn’t supported me at all and “doesn’t know how to feel.”

My boyfriend has a group chat he texts and FaceTimes sometimes. We recently began living together with my dog. His friends called him on a Group FaceTime call. My boyfriend started asking if they wanted to see my dog and put the camera on me and the dog. His friends immediately started laughing and hanging up.

2020-09-13 18:56:20,is4957,4,3,"Hi everyone,

I've not posted here before but have followed the sub for a while now trying to learn more about being non-binary, and I've followed a bunch of related subs too, but I'm still confused about my own identity and would really appreciate some advice. Please forgive if I misuse gender terms, I try my best and am still learning, please correct me but just know nothing is said with ill intent.

I was AFAB, but up until secondary school I was a real tomboy. I never wanted to hang out with girls, I just wanted to be 'one of the boys'. I don't know if I wanted *to be* male, but I didn't want to be a girly girl. I wanted to race and play rugby and wrestle with the boys. In secondary school, the uniform made me wear skirts and dresses, which I hated but had to conform to. Girls and boys sports were separate (I had to play netball, no rugby or cricket or football for the most part), and for the most part girls and boys didn't really mix either. This led to me being around girls more, but never really fitting in, but by the end of this period I didn't really fit in with boys either. In Sixth form and uni, I became really involved with feminism and equality for women. I began to slowly accept that I was born female, I was a woman, and I should own that and actively participate in trying to make the world a more equal place.

But something inside of me just isn't right. I wish I had been born male, because I have a lot of dysmorphia around my body (I've stopped my periods, and I'm talking to doctors about having breast reduction surgery to make me flat chested). But I don't feel transgender - that I would want to transition to be a male. I feel like my biological sex doesn't matter - except for the periods and breast stuff and I can get rid of those. But it's how being female affects life, and I think this is what the gender element of this all is. It's not that I dislike being female, I just hate how society tries to limit me because I was born female... but I just don't know what gender that makes me. I don't like being a woman or girl because society treats them differently (usually worse) compared to men and boys... but I don't feel as if I am a man or boy either?

I feel like my backstory - being a tomboy made to conform and is now confused - plays a factor. I wish I could go back to the mentality when I was that young, of not having gender expectations on me because of being born female.

I have looked at non-binary and other gender identities. I certainly feel like I don't fit into the binary, but not that I'm genderfluid... maybe agender? I'm sorry this is long and confusing, I'd really appreciate any thoughts or pointers to places I could learn more.",NonBinary,Need advice - questioning gender,1600048580.0,"{'created_utc': 1600023380, 'id': 'is4957', 'num_comments': 4, 'score': 3, 'selftext': ""Hi everyone,\n\nI've not posted here before but have followed the sub for a while now trying to learn more about being non-binary, and I've followed a bunch of related subs too, but I'm still confused about my own identity and would really appreciate some advice.

2020-09-13 22:22:04,is84zc,2,2,"Hi! It's my first post to this sub, so I'm sorry if anything is awry.

I'd like advice on what kinds of clothing can make an AMAB person look more androgynous without being too feminine. I'm asking because my partner's birthday is next month, and they've recently come out to our little  'bubble' of friends as enby. As a result, they're now feeling ready to start looking for more gender-affirming clothes, and I figured the perfect birthday gift for them would be a couple of complete outfits. I  have a little extra disposable income due to my country's c\*vid support,  so I could probably order one or two items with afterpay/zip pay and get  them express shipped. I also have a sewing machine and live reasonably  close to a Spotlight store, so if anyone has patterns I could use,  that'd be super helpful too (especially since I'd be able to size them more accurately haha).

Their body type is definitely more 'masculine' than not. They're not overweight by any means, but I suppose you could say they're an ectomorph, with reasonably broad shoulders and muscular arms. Anything that draws attention to their shoulders will probably not be a good fit.

As for what styles they like, it's a little hard to say. The line between  'good, gender-affirming androgyny' and 'too effeminate' appears to be  extremely thin. I DO know they're a big fan of elaborate formal or gothic looks, like these:- [https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0025/9709/3489/products/Punk-Rave-Dionysium-Tail-Coat-WY-1007-b\_1200x1200.jpg?v=1586854837](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0025/9709/3489/products/Punk-Rave-Dionysium-Tail-Coat-WY-1007-b_1200x1200.jpg?v=1586854837)\- [https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1wMFzNXzqK1RjSZFoq6zfcXXaU.jpg\_q50.jpg](https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1wMFzNXzqK1RjSZFoq6zfcXXaU.jpg_q50.jpg)\- [https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e6/c4/f3/e6c4f3645735c8bca7e8b0e6e7ffa485.jpg](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e6/c4/f3/e6c4f3645735c8bca7e8b0e6e7ffa485.jpg)However-  what they think looks good, and what they feel confident in wearing,  are different matters. They have a beautiful burgundy velvet jacket in the wardrobe that they only wear for very formal occasions, and it looks fantastic on them, but they have to pluck up a lot of courage to walk out the door wearing it. I'm hoping to find or make something that will be much easier to wear in the day-to-day.

They also love bright and pastel colours, especially pink, although I am a  bit concerned that a 'pastel goth' kind of ensemble might also be too intimidating and 'feminine' for them. Some more simple/plain pieces  would be helpful, like maybe this- [https://images.takeluckhome.com/images/392x588/201812/R/unique-letter-faith-pattern-long-sleeve-high-low-hem-loose-cape-hoodie\_1544442617676.jpg](https://images.takeluckhome.com/images/392x588/201812/R/unique-letter-faith-pattern-long-sleeve-high-low-hem-loose-cape-hoodie_1544442617676.jpg)

One thing to consider, though, is that it's the start of spring here, and  I'd like for them to be able to wear at least some of these clothes through summer. So the heavy gothic jackets and hoodies are going to be difficult.

2020-09-14 09:50:07,ishx1d,8,3,"apologies if this kind of question isn’t allowed!

i’ve been wondering about my gender for a while, and i’d really appreciate your input.

i’m a gnc femme lesbian, and due to (possibly) my lesbian identity i’ve always felt a disconnect from traditional womanhood. 

being referred to as a woman never seemed quite right to me, and i’ve never “felt like a girl/woman” (whatever that means!). i’ve always been somewhat gnc (despite the fact that the  butch/femme subculture is very meaningful to me) and there have been times where i’ve pondered whether or not i’m trans - i don’t believe i am, but i do feel dissatisfied with some of my sex characteristics and i used to (nsfw text warning) &gt;! wish i had a penis, mostly for having sex with other women !&lt; (that could be an aspect of internalised lesbophobia though. subconsciously not seeing f/f sex as valid, yknow?)

it also feels slightly futile identifying as anything other than a woman. i can’t identify out of my oppression, and despite feeling like an outsider, i  feel like narrowing the definition of “woman” to fit only extremely binary women is surely a bad thing?

To give y'all some perspective, I have worked here for about 2 years.

Historically, changing my name has been incredibly difficult for myself and the people around me. I never seemed to feel comfortable with my new name and I would also be too passive to ever correct anyone who seemed to forget my name/pronouns. 

4 years later, I now live in a more accepting location (SF), have a supportive partner, and my current friend group took the transition with much ease. However, I was still afraid that I would not be so successful when I would go back to work which ended up being about a month ago. I was honestly terrified to be my own advocate but I felt that the more times I would stick up and reintroduce myself the easier it got. It took everyone a couple weeks of practice but now everyone has been using my name/correct pronouns when saying hello to me, sending me an emails, and referring to me even when I'm not around.

I saw a TikTok video from a nonbinary account I follow that triggered this post (more on that in a second), but it got me thinking...what IS gender? what does it actually MEAN to feel like a particular gender? Every explanation I see is just so shallow, like ""women are feminine and do X"" ""men are masculine and do Y""...and I know that there's way more to it than that.


The reason this all came to me is that I was watching a Tiktok from a nonbinary person whose content I really enjoy. He (that is his preferred pronoun) duetted another video where the person was talking and the gist was, you can be AMAB and masculine (or AFAB and feminine) and still be nonbinary. Which, I am not the gender police, though I am really starting to hate the concept of gender at all. But here is, I guess, where I am confused. If, for example, an AMAB, masculine presenting all the time person identifies as non-binary...what is...non-binary about that? If you were born male, and present as a man, and you are comfortable doing so all of the time (wouldn't there be some dysphoria??), what is the non-binary part?

I'm also not trying to negate anyone's gender identity, just trying to understand.

I have been really confused lately and it's causing me a lot of stress. I have no other lgbt friends to talk to about this stuff so here goes.

I'm a nonbinary lesbian. I barely realized I was a lesbian two years. Aside from still battling comphet on practically a daily basis, now I'm really struggling with my gender/pronouns.

Up until recently, my pronouns were they/she but now I go by they/them for reasons I can't even recall now. It just felt like a necessary change. Like I said I'm very confused. I announced it to several online friends and followers and they have been super supportive.

But now it's almost like I miss my she/her pronouns? That's what I was used to for 23 years of my life so I'm not sure if it's just shock/change. I also now feel detached from my lesbianism which I know is ridiculous since lesbians can have any pronouns. Gender and sexuality are two separate things, I know that.

Thinking about other lgbt people, especially other lesbians, I would love for them to refer to me as she/her. Or I would love to be called somebody's ""girlfriend"". Mostly it's cishets, especially cishet men, I don't like referring to me as such lol. 

So all that said I think I kinda wanna go back to she/her or they/she but I feel incredibly stupid/embarrassed since I just announced my new pronouns to the world lol. I have a lot of anxiety about what people think of me. And this could come off as cry for attention. Idk.

This also has me thinking, am I even nonbinary at all??? If I just end up going back to she/her. Like I said: hella confused.

(I live in a village, with not that much of people, and I dont even know most of them)  \nSorry if this is a bit hard to understand if I dont use the correct words for it or anything  \n(Yes, I would rather ask other enbies than Google-)  \n\n\nOne more thing; by the look-thing, or like...yknow, ""the way the person looks is feminine/masculine and I dont expect them to be nonbinary"" thing isnt supposed to say that you cant be feminine or masculine if youre nonbinary.

Im afab (24) and have been questioning if I am enby. I have had an interesting relationship with gender identity for my whole life. I know that gender identity and gender presentation are different but I just want to give like a full background I guess. I hated everything feminine growing up. I refused to wear pink or dresses or skirts and I would practice a more masculine walk and burping on command (lol). Over time once I realized clothes and colors arent really gender specific I started being more comfortable wearing dresses, pink, and makeup. Although now I do not like wearing dresses and get anxiety wearing them. I am a twin and while my sister would hangout with the girl we were on a playdate with and I would play video games with their younger brothers. I don't believe I feel any body dysphoria. I love my body but dont necessarily think of it as feminine but just my body I do feel discomfort presenting too feminine or too masculine (but this can also depend on the day for me if I feel more comfortable being more feminine or more masculine). I have no problems with my pronouns  at the moment as she/her but wouldn't mind also using they/them. I do though feel weird when I refer to myself as female or a woman, most days I just feel like a person.

I recently read redefining realness by Janet Mock and the way that she describes womanhood and knowing she is a woman I just didn't really relate to. I don't know if this all makes sense.

I’m sorry. God, I’m so, so, fucking sorry.

I know exactly what it’s like to feel trapped in a world that doesn’t understand you. A world that feels openly hostile towards you. And how hopeless it feels seeing bigoted comments towards you let fly because as a minority the majority have that sort of power over you.

I became the very thing I despise more than anything else. A bigot.

It’s a long story how it happened. When I came out as trans I was very confused about what it really meant, what gender identity even was etc., I had a lot of stupid takes. Such as that you needed dysphoria to be trans. It wasn’t out of a sense of malice, I was just genuinely misinformed. So I started spending time on truscum subreddits and watching truscum YouTubers hoping to find like-minded people. All I knew about truscum was that they believed you needed dysphoria to be trans, I wasn’t anticipating that I was going to roped into a cult-like hateful ideology (the hint is in the name dumb dumb). I began hearing and even directly being told enbyphobic nonsense, and unfortunately instead of recognising it for what it was, I stupidly began to believe the horrible shit I was hearing about you.

I eventually realised why you don't need dysphoria to be trans and stopped identifying as a truscum. It was upon leaving the echo chamber did I realise how horribly radicalised I had become.

And that’s when the guilt came. I NEVER wanted to hurt anyone. I was a truscum because I was an idiot, not because I had malice in my heart. Hell, I very briefly identified as non-binary before I realised I was a girl. I wasn't an enbyphobe until I started listening to and believing their hateful bullshit.

It’s been 4 months since I got out of it. I still feel an overwhelming sense of guilt for what I was thinking and saying about you. If I think too long about it I’ll start crying. At times I’ve self-harmed out of self-hatred. I wanted to pay for what I’d done, to feel the pain I as a truscum could have inflicted on you.

My heart breaks when I read about the kinds of challenges you face. Going forward I'll fight harder for you than I used to against you.

I've been questioning for a while about whether I might be nonbinary. I recently discovered the word greygender and I'm thinking it might apply to me? I've never identified strongly as a woman, I assumed that everyone felt that way about their gender assigned at birth. Like ""I'm a woman because that's just kind of how it happened, but I don't really care about it."" 

But at the same time I would prefer to be ""clocked"" as androgynous. BUT I'm not upset when people refer to me as a woman. 

I really dislike my boobs, but I think that's mostly because they're uncomfortably large for me, I'm currently a 32DDD. I would rather have smaller ones so I would have the ability to be flat with a sports bra (without an actual binder). 

Just wondering if you lovely people on this sub would have any insight, a different word for what I'm feeling, or if you think greygender seems like a match for me.

My hair went down my back and past my hips, hints of auburn when the sun hit it just right - the only indication of my Irish heritage. My desire to know more about myself was matched with my hunger for change and pestering my mother for layers and blue hair. I was placed under her thumb - I couldn’t change who I was and what I looked like without her express permission and in doing so hid myself from the world. Upon accidentally kissing my childhood best friend at the age of six we both drew back and flushed, hoping no one had seen our slip up. My eyes would cast downward when a topless girl would walk past at the pool, ashamed for taking notice and embarrassed I’d be caught in the act. My thoughts lingered on the girl who sat two rows ahead of me in my 6th grade English class as her eyes danced with laughter. My hair weighed me down like a curtain, concealing my inner thoughts and feelings from those around me. My fingers itched to pick up scissors.

My heart fluttered in anticipation as the shears came closer - the same way it would when she’d look at me across the classroom and wink and how, at parties, her favorite seat was my lap. We’d joke about dating and hold hands in the hall despite the warning glare we’d get from the principal as we entered school. The hip English teacher would apologetically tell us we couldn’t have public displays of affection, but told us she supported us nonetheless. She was the closest I got to having a girlfriend, but we remained just that - friends. I think of her from time to time and silently thank her for showing me who I had the potential to be.

At thirteen I found the courage to talk to my mother - the tyrant who controlled my life and who I feared - on a walk around the neighborhood. I was met with disgust and disbelief - after all, being bi was just a trend and I’d get over it. Anger boiled in me, but I let it fester deep in my heart and instead adopted a streak of blue hair. I was then placed in a room for suspended students for a week - an oddly rewarding punishment for not conforming to my school’s rules. I learned that being a rebel and gay removed me from pedestals I had been forced on.

A year and a new school later, I found myself as a freshman in a school for bright kids who went above and beyond what was expected of them. I also discovered how blatantly I disliked being looked down upon for not being feminine enough by my family. I didn’t know how to broach the topic, so I did what I knew best - I dyed my hair. My auburn hair had now grown and the streak of blue had faded, leaving a flash of white in its wake. I contemplated what to do with my hair and settled on a mossy green ombre, faded from my hair color to make it look as “natural” as possible. I donned more flannels and ripped jeans and abandoned my colorful wardrobe for a sea of black. I began to sit “un-lady like” and lost the pleasantries my mother had instilled in me at a young age because it benefited others more than it did me to be “tame” and quiet. I found that “acting like a man” got me in trouble because I didn’t fit the box my family had placed me in, but being masculine gave me a rush of adrenaline I had never experienced before. When I looked in the mirror a part of me felt at home, not like a foreigner in my own body. I stopped listening to my mother’s “suggestions”.

My sophomore year I met a girl who stole my heart and turned my hair white. My best friend introduced us over lunch and we spent all of our free time together from then on out. She became part of our group and my feelings for her grew, yet I kept them hidden, knowing that they’d never be reciprocated. We bonded over art and poetry and spent endless nights awake together in each other’s beds, talking about our intertwining futures. We swore to be in each other’s lives until my hair turned white without the help of bleach.

As my hair grew out I contemplated what to do and who to be next. Within the next year I grew increasingly uncomfortable with the expectations I placed on myself to feel like I belonged in my friend group. I was unsure how to come out to my friends and the girl who stole my heart in fear of how they’d react. I knew they would be supportive but the fear of the unknown drove me to silence. In my creative writing class I was prompted to choose a new name, little did I know it would stick beyond the classroom. My junior English teacher who I admired but never really spoke to was the first person to notice I wasn’t cis. It took one paper with my newly donned name for him to approach me on the topic. He never skipped a beat when it came to saying my name correctly, where it took weeks for others to follow. I avoided coming out to my friends, and as tensions rose, I lost them to my own negligence. The girl I loved left with my closest friends and my heart, so I cut my hair and made it white again, faded to blue. I spent months crying, and swore to never love someone again.

November of my senior year, freshly eighteen and proud - I decided to cut my hair shorter, unsure of how short my mother would let me go. I found myself stuck with a slightly more stylish and disheveled bowl cut, glad that I could get away with such a masculine haircut. I had stolen yet another base from my mother, only a year away from home run - freedom. A month later at a drunken New Years party I met him - my older cousin’s roommate who I had only heard about through her fiance. We talked all night and realized how alike we were, and I spent the following months with him. I cared for this man more than I did myself, despite the fact that it was like looking in a mirror with a filter adding on nine years and an alcohol addiction. I feared a great many things in the few months I shared with him - the fact that he’d leave with my heart, that I would become him, and that he’d see me as everyone else did - a woman. 

Our relationship ended just as it had started, over his love for alcohol and the fact that we were too alike. It remains unclear on whether or not he knew I was non-binary - there were always more important topics on hand to talk about - but some of his last words to me related how unwelcome he was to my “dramatic, gay lifestyle”. I guess in the end he couldn’t “take my flaws” despite “liking the totality of \[me\]” like he originally believed. I promptly returned to my white hair, hoping it would bleach the bitter feelings from my mind and heart.

It took seven months, sleeping with my best friend and a pair of buzzers later to bounce back to being myself and not a heartbroken mess. I went to college with a nearly bald head and a new identity free from my mother’s reach and expectations, glad to finally be myself. On my first day on my own I met a guy and we promptly became friends and expanded our circle in the following weeks. I found myself surrounded with people exactly like me - gay and proud - who knew where I came from and what I had gone through.

hi! im afab and only attracted to women and enby ppl. i am unsure if i am non-binary because im fine with being called a girl, maybe slightly uncomfortable with being called a woman but that could be because of my age (im 19). i enjoy looking kind of androgynous, wearing male clothing at times, the idea of being mistaken for a dude on the street is interesting to me but i wouldn’t want to be addressed as a man/use he/him pronouns. i’m good w she/her and id be ok with they/them but i have a preference for she/her. the main reasons i might consider myself non-binary is that 1. womanhood is shaped by ur attraction/appeal to men, and im not attracted to men and don’t want their attention so i do feel a slight disconnect from womanhood 2.

anyway I can describe what happened.

I was playing ftf and we won against this kid. cool. he then goes into my dms and cusses me out, then does the same for my friends. The next round we team up to kill him, and he gets even more pissed off and says that ""we're just a bunch of girls hating on him for no reason""

I explain to him I am nonbinary in dms. Then he says that I can't be nonbinary and I can only be a boy or a girl. (bs, dont believe that) and says that I am an idiot. I told my friends in the main chat that he was homophobic (I was in a bit of a panic mode, it triggers me cause of personal experiences.)

Then he says that he's straight. (as an insult I think?) Then we all get into a huge argument about how nonbinary is a gender not sexuality, that my parents are NOT Lgbt because they don't support it (yeah really) and that children should not go ranting on about things they dont understand. He then said (this is really funny) that supporting is gay. I said that because he supported his claims he is gay and he got super pissed and told me he's straight. 

then a random person who joined the server said that they dont support lgbt and said that women and men should be together and nothing else. then said jk and explained that we are cool but she doesnt support lgbt. then went on to say super homophobic things almost in support of the other kid.

I told my friends in the main chat that he was homophobic (I was in a bit of a panic mode, it triggers me cause of personal experiences.)\n\nThen he says that he\'s straight. (as an insult I think?) Then we all get into a huge argument about how nonbinary is a gender not sexuality, that my parents are NOT Lgbt because they don\'t support it (yeah really) and that children should not go ranting on about things they dont understand. He then said (this is really funny) that supporting is gay. I said that because he supported his claims he is gay and he got super pissed and told me he\'s straight. \n\nthen a random person who joined the server said that they dont support lgbt and said that women and men should be together and nothing else. then said jk and explained that we are cool but she doesnt support lgbt. then went on to say super homophobic things almost in support of the other kid.\n\nAnd after I left to post this to reddit!

2020-09-19 18:56:08,ivyhdg,16,1,"I'm AFAB (nb and they/them pronouns). Around half a year ago I decided that I would finally stop listening to people telling me that I can't chop my waist length hair off because it's oh so pretty, because it would be a shame and because they would miss it.

I went to the hairdresser for the first time, told them I wanted all my hair cut off and an undercut. She was all like ""Oh but what if you don't like it? Why don't we start slow?"". She ended up convincing me to get a bob. The longest parts of it were at the bottom of my ears.

It wasn't quite what I wanted, but it already felt so much better than the super long hair, I was much more comfortable with myself. I really enjoyed it, but of course it grew out after a few months.

I went to a different hairdresser and told him I wanted short hair. It basically looked like someone had put half of a very blonde coconut on my head, kind of like Angela Merkel in her early days. Couldn't convince him to cut my hair shorter, so I just decided to let it grow out again.

But I didn't feel very comfortable with it, so I tried yet another hairdresser today. It's gotten even worse. I showed her pictures and everything. She did shave the lower third of my head, which is way less than what I wanted, but at least she's been shaving some parts I guess. But the rest of it... Ugh. She barely cut any hair off there, so you can't even see the shaved parts. Instead she chose to insult my natural hair color and said I'd look retarded if I cut any more off. It was extremely awkward and frustrating. I'm pretty good at hating myself, I don't have to pay anybody else to do that for me lol. 

I'm now even more dysphoric than I was with the waist long hair, and as a bonus I also feel ugly as fuck. I look like a girl that was shaved while asleep as a prank. But the worst part is it's so feminine. It's just too girly. And I'm not a girl ffs. 

I've tried putting the rest of my longish hair in something like a bun, and it's probably the best I can do right now. It's okay as long as nobody else is around, but I dread having to leave my room tomorrow. 

I've given up on hairdressers.  So yeah, I'm going to buy a razor on Monday and try doing it myself. It's probably going to look awful, but at least it will finally be short. And if it looks all to bad I'm just gonna do a buzzcut. And if I ever decided to go to a hairdresser again I'd already chop of most of my hair beforehand so they don't have a choice.

2020-09-19 21:30:39,iw16za,14,1,"Hi everyone! I'll try to make this short. (nvm I falied, sorry)

About half a year ago I started questioning which gender I consider myself, this started because someone thought I was a male online. This thought only came up a few times, but in August I started playing online and many people asked me which gender (in my language gender and sex has the same word) I am, to which of course I answered that I'm a girl.

But this wasn't what pushed me to finally post an ask here; I was doing a survey when the question came up: what do you identify as? So I looked at the options for a good minute, and felt like an ass when I finally put gender questioning.

Because all of this, I spent a lot of time researching what gender are there, but I don't feel anything towards any of them. Honestly, I feel like I care a lot about my gender, but only when I start questioning it. Also, I don't want people to focus on this aspect of me, as I don't think that this should make me any different from anyone. 

I know that it doesn't matter how you present yourself when the gender topic comes up, but I really wanna look androgynous, or at least less feminine. 

And I can't even try pronouns out, mostly beacuse I can't care about them since we use a neutral one for everyone in my country. 

I looked into agender, and it seems pretty cool, but I don't know whether it would fit, and I have no idea how I should try these things out. 

I know you guys can't decide for me, so I just wanna ask something: should people feel something when they are asked about they gender? I'm asking this because I've ran into this problem before I found out I'm aroace; I didn't know others felt something. But I might just be a confused cis. I fear that I'm ""pretending"" to feel like I'm not a female.

I recently got a new job in a factory in a male dominated field. 
Upon starting the job, I have been here for exactly 1 month and have already been approached SEVERAL times by people who want to say how glad they are to have a *woman* on the floor because there are virtually no women at this job. All but 1 person who has approached me has been female. And I would normally just write it off as them being relieved to have another woman to work with if they actually worked **with** me but all of them are women who are higher ups (process engineers, Quality Analysis people, etc.) And I've also heard that before I even started here the crew was told they were getting a girl assigned to the crew and that was like, a big deal apparently, because they're all dudes and were worried about how the crew members with no filter were going to do with a *girl* around. 

I usually don't mind wether my gender is perceived as female or not because it usually isn't a big deal and nobody really mentions it. But this is so excessive it is really wigging me out. And I hate it. 

I already wear sports bras and we all wear the same uniform and also I'm wearing a mask and a hard hat so, you know. The only thing I can really change to be gender neutral is my eyes. I have naturally long dark lashes, so with just the eyes and nothing else to go by (without the hard hat I have short hair), I do look very much female, is there any way to make my eyes less feminine? 


Also I can't really wear a binder because it's 12 hr shifts and I do like having boobs on rare occasion so I don't really want to permanently damage them just too look more gender neutral at my job. I'm planning to order a sports bra from TomboyX because I've heard those are really good at flattening the chest. And I figure the flatter I can make my chest the better. The only other thing I can figure to do is get a facemask that's enby colors? But I think I'm literally the only queer person here so that would probably go over the heads of all my coworkers.

My best friend is someone who is, other than to me, very closed off. She’s incredibly sweet and friendly but a closed book. She’s always been very careful about what she tells me about her life/self and when she tells me. And as I’m writing this I’m realizing maybe this answers my question, and I should just keep to myself about this possible information. 

As far as I know to this point, my friend uses she/her pronouns. We were having a PowerPoint night in her apartment, and I was on her browser, the first tab that opened was a search about what it means to be non-binary. So I clicked out of it before she knew I saw, because I knew she’d be mortified and I didn’t want to embarrass her at all in front of our friends. Especially if she’s not sure yet for herself. 
Aaahhh. I just want to be there for her to help her figure everything out. I’m going into the counseling field, and I could really help her. I’m worried that she’s going to be beating herself up or confused for so long. To be honest, if she went by they/them or she/they pronouns it would make perfect sense to me and I know that none of our friends would had an eyelash about it either. 

She has so much support around her and I just want her to know that during this life journey/realization. Is it an awful idea to bring it up? Is there even a way to bring it up?

I was in utter shock by this because I'm asexual nonbinary and wear pride bracelets based on my gender and sexual orientation. My parents are against me wearing them because they don't want me advertising that I am ""strange."" Yet they feel that its okay to shove their religion down people's throats?! Anyway I was way too polite to this customer, maybe its because I'm half Japanese. I was so angry I talked to my manager about it and she took the booklet away.

Earlier I was with my dad getting pizza he said he is scared for me. He's very religious and thinks I'm going down a dangerous path; turning away from religion and associating myself with the LGBTQ and all. In other words he thinks I'm gonna go to hell. Either this man with the booklet was a coincidence or God was trying to tell me something. Either way I'm mad because I do not ever want to go back to Christianity after what I experienced.

I recently discovered that im most likely bisexual and im currently trying to figure out whether im nonbinary or just a confused cis woman. The thing is that regarding my attraction to women i feel uncomfortable considering them of my own gender. The label “wlw” makes me a little uneasy because it focalises on the womanhood of everyone involved and I don’t feel comfortable with that. Before I even started questioning my gender whenever i talked about women as a group i almost never included myself in the speech (ex: instead of “we women....” i’d just say “women...” it may sound weird in English but it makes more sense in my native language) and I never felt 100% comfortable in all girl groups. Looking back, I think I feared doing or saying something considered “too masculine” or too “unwomanlike” that would “reveal” I wasn’t one of them, but this interpretation of my discomfort may be me retconning my own past.

2020-09-21 05:43:30,iwuiwz,2,1,So I know that I’m nonbinary and lesbian/trixic like I’ve always known but didn’t have a word for it until now and my family is kind of conservative and low key homophobic and I was homeschooled my whole life up until college pretty much. Anyways it’s just so annoying that I can’t even take myself seriously I keep having the thought in the back of mind that I’m doing it for attention or that I’m not actually attracted to women that I’m just trying to convince myself that I’m “different” or something that I don’t actually have top dysphoria because I’m okay with wearing a bra or being perceived as female. But I know I’m not okay with any of that and that I am only attracted to women and other nonbinary people and that I’m not a woman that I am nonbinary and have top dysphoria but sometimes it just gets so hard to believe myself when I keep having those types of thoughts/internalized homophobia.

2020-09-21 16:13:25,ix3fwn,0,1,"TL;DR I have a complicated relationship with my body and I don't understand what it means for my gender

That I know of, I identify as a trans man, just meaning that I am a guy but I was born female (a thing that for me is gender-neutral... I don't attach gender meaning to having 10 fingers so I don't see what anatomy have to do with it). I will be extremely honest in hopes to receive some of your insights.

I am hella confused about what to think about my body, because if I forget about the rest of the world I am just a male with just a lot of weird fat in the wrong places that I am working out and dieting about (same for a cis man to get rid of the beer belly). I am also a gay bottom so it's not a drama, even if I admit that I want to try being top sometimes, and more often to be seen as a traditionally desirable gay partner. And I want to be androgynous, gender-playful and queer in my looks so I think that if I was unmistakably male I could play with gender without getting misgendered.

I had a huge number of conversations with people who did and are in favour of medical transition, and so fare no one has convinced me. If anything I feel bad about myself for not being a ""real man"" and wanting to transition. I have transitioned socially 5 years ago, and received my BA with the public proclamation done in the masculine form. I did my coming out at work two times and it resulted in both job HR's pressuring me to medically transition, they didn't understood at all. So I am partly a bit reluctant because I don't want to have to do it to normalise myself in the eyes of society: I don't want to believe that there is something wrong with me that must be corrected, I like to think that I am naturally born a guy and that's it. Am I wrong?

The other problem is that I have too much fear about side effects and the complications of the medical procedures... please let's not make it a discussion on pros and cons of T and surgeries, for some reason it's a painful topic and it will overshadow the rest of the discussion. At least it is as risky as every surgery or medication out there, and that in itself is too much for me. I don't want to feel at fault for refusing or not being able to process my aversion to dealing with healthcare unless I'm sick. I am also against what happens in my country, that you have to go to the psychiatrist to be certified trans and transition, then to legal court... I don't want that, it's traumatising and no one have to do that for an ok to be pregnant or tattoo their face (irreversible choices with social consequences, that's what I mean here). Also all of this means that for society I have to go from ""Female to Male"" when I am already Male, anatomy notwithstanding. Am I wrong?

I also want a regular male body with no scars and natural genitalia and identical workings, and I am aware that it's not going to happen. If one day it will be available a solution with those results and minimal risks I would be willing. This makes me feel that I am ageing (waltzing towards 40) and losing out on the best dating years. I am very confused, what does it all mean for my gender identity?

i’ve been identifying as non-binary for about a year now and even though my current pronouns (they/them) and name make me feel so much more comfortable i’m constantly questioning my own validity and it’s really difficult to deal with. 

being non-binary is so hard to describe that sometimes I almost believe all the people who say that i’m just “faking it” even though I KNOW i’m not?? 

I guess... how do you guys deal with stuff like this? especially when it comes to people who tell you that being non-binary doesn’t exist or that you’re “just adding a label to discomfort” or whatever? i’ve been having a tough time lately and i’d really appreciate some kind words.",NonBinary,self-doubt and dealing w dismissive comments?,1600759863.0,"{'created_utc': 1600734663, 'id': 'ixcz6o', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'hello :) \n\ni’ve been identifying as non-binary for about a year now and even though my current pronouns (they/them) and name make me feel so much more comfortable i’m constantly questioning my own validity and it’s really difficult to deal with. \n\nbeing non-binary is so hard to describe that sometimes I almost believe all the people who say that i’m just “faking it” even though I KNOW i’m not?? \n\nI guess... how do you guys deal with stuff like this? especially when it comes to people who tell you that being non-binary doesn’t exist or that you’re “just adding a label to discomfort” or whatever? i’ve been having a tough time lately and i’d really appreciate some kind words.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'self-doubt and dealing w dismissive comments?', 'created': 1600759863.0}"

I first accepted the fact that I was not cis-gendered in July. It then was followed up by several questions of where I fall on the wide sea of genders.

Now I'm here in September and I think that I've answered several questions about my gender. I'm certain that I don't feel comfortable being male or being called a man. It's something that has bothered me throughout my entire life and I've always wanted to dress more femininely. But now I'm left with this thought, am I gender fluid, am I trans, or am I ace? 

Where I'm left confused here is that some parts of the day I feel like a girl, and I feel like I can actually perceive a gender. Then on other parts of the day, I feel like I have no gender and that gender is just something that doesn't exist in me at the moment.

I have a question to which I just can't find answers through Google. In my state, I can mark ""X"" under ""gender"" on the driver's license form.

Agender/agender boy fluid flux(?)

agender/agender boy fluid = sometimes I feel agender, other days I feel agender with a slight link to male

flux = (I have no idea if this is the correct term but it made sense in my head so until I can find something better I'm using this for now) when I do feel a slight connection to male it changes in severity.

My friends found it easier to understand when I expressed it like a line/graph thing.

left to right = left being agender, right being agender with the strongest link to male

up to down = up feeling the strongest to male, down feeling the least strongest but still there

it changes..?

i think it's so funny that i wrote this song years before i began to question my gender identity..... at the time it was just an expression of devotion and the freedom of finding someone you can be yourself around. of course, it still probably is mostly that, but looking back it's hard for me to explain my writing this song-- choosing this particular way to express that feeling-- as anything other than the real me breaking through the cracks in the assigned gender i still didn't feel empowered to question. like, seriously... my sister asked me about it and i found myself at an utter loss trying to explain what the hell else i could have meant by ""i wanna be your man / i wanna be your woman."" idk about y'all, but i just seem to notice more and more of these moments as time goes by and i grow more comfortable in myself... moments that, in retrospect, make me feel like a blind fool for not finding myself earlier.

anyway.... love song, enby anthem..... make what you want of it. you can check out the lyric video i made for it below! if you like it, then i made it for you.

2020-09-24 05:01:48,iyqv8f,6,1,"Hi loves! I've got a doozy for ya.

Around the age of 15 I was thinking about the distant future and came to the conclusion that if humanity ever gets past climate change, racism, etc. and reaches a utopia-esque civilization that we’d inevitably move towards a genderless society. Or like - that the classification of men and women (I was stuck in the binary in highschool) would inevitably become irrelevant in a utopian timeline. This idea (hope?) stuck with me.

After I realized I was trans at age 22, I settled on using she and they pronouns partially because of this long-standing belief. I also came to the conclusion that nonbinary transfemme was the best descriptor for who I am. That idea I had at age 15 morphed as my understanding of gender grew. Part of it morphed into a desire to fundamentally restructure the english language to have one third person pronoun, they.

I'm 26 now, and since I hormonally and socially transitioned, I've had some doubts and have wondered if I might just be a binary woman. I've had some doubts about the idea. But it still holds some weight in me and it feels like a good indicator that I might be nonbinary. Not the only indicator, but still.

Here's where it gets tricky - recently a friend posted on facebook, the message being: We should reserve the word “they” for non-binary folx and not refer to people whose pronouns you don’t know by they (instead saying ""that person wearing red,"" or ""your friend,"" etc.). This led me to reconsider the idea and wonder if it was inherently flawed. While talking with my girlfriend about it, I realized that this idea of mine -might- be akin colorblindedness, but for gender (not that it would be the same, race and gender are very different, just trying to take learnings and see if they can be applied elsewhere!)

If we were to shift our language only use they, we might be hindering discussion and understanding of very real issues that exist along lines of gender in our society. Some languages don't use gendered third person pronouns, but I'm not sure if removing language is really be something to strive for in ours.

I am writing to you as I need your advice and wisdom in terms of gender identity.

For a very long time, I identified myself as a cisgender male, but I have started to realize that I prefer rejecting the gender norm of masculinity and I do not fit into what society deems masculine. Moreover, I do have some 'feminine' aspects of me but I do not think that I identify as a woman. However, I am starting to think that maybe I am non-binary. But I do not know if I am, and if I am, which part do I belong to (you see that is because I really like using labels to identify and introduce myself).

So please, if any of you can spare a bit of your time to clarify a couple of things for me, that would be very good. Thank you so so so so much!

i started questioning my gender a few days ago and i think i’m nonbinary... like i’m sure i’m not male but i also feel like i’m not 100% female. i’m afab and i’ve never really minded being referred to as she/her or being precieved as female. but today i tied my hair in a ponytail to make it look short and tried out they/them pronouns both in english and my native language in front of the mirror. the way it sounded made me so happy :) this is probably the happiest i’ve ever been in a very long time!!
this is all very new to me and it’s probably going to change some time later but i’m happy with this for now :)
i wanted to share this moment with someone and this seems like the right place to do so.

I’m high femme in my own definition of what that means- I’m an artist and a lot of what I feel like I express in my styling and makeup in my everyday life is an expression of “bastardized” femininity. I want to express psycho doll cat Marnell energy. My style is like super trashy late 2000s rock of love contestant. I’m really inspired by the physical material beauty and also ugliness/internalized bitchiness of femininity. So all of this is very gendered but to me it’s like an art piece about femininity that I’m performing but it doesn’t mean I’m a woman. Does that make sense??? I’m so self conscious about coming out as non-binary because I feel like I don’t deserve it (I can comfortably pass as a straight cis girl).  It’s partly related to me wanting to modify my body and be able to present like a doll. I want to be able to shave my head and wear different wigs everyday. I want to be able to be a performance a lot of the time but I don’t know who the real constant me is and what is dysphoria. I finally spoke about it out loud (for the first time to myself!) to my partner and it was so powerful like one of those moments where you can feel like a buildup has been happening for so long and you finally release it and it was so strong that I immediately started crying.

It's funny because how I choose to express my gender has been pretty stable since childhood (a fairly androgynous look on the whole, and my clothes themselves are a flashy kind of masculine. 

The reason I'm starting to wonder if I'm nonbinary stem from my sexuality. I've felt a lot of confusion around being a masculine woman (?) attracted to men. The biggest thing push for me toward being nonbinary is that it makes my gender identity and sexual orientation feel more harmonious; it's not that masculine presenting straight women don't exist, but for me it feels like I'm trying to connect two things that don't make sense; like having a too-short phone charger. And since I'm very sure I'm attracted to men, I don't really know where the feelings of ""this doesn't make sense"" would be coming from other than somewhere gender-y. Plus, I think about gender so goddamn much...

But when I start to consider a nonbinary identity more seriously, it gets muddy. I'm not sure if discomfort presenting as stereotypically female even really *counts* as dysphoria, but that's the only kind I have. Admittedly, it's strong, but as long as I present masculine I'm good to go.

I just feel like I have so many things that point to ""not"" nonbinary (no dysphoria except for presentation; could just be a masc woman) that I might not be nonbinary after all. Like, basically, any \~transitioning\~ I would do would be mostly theoretical; the major changes (clothes, hair, even some gendered terms) have already been done for me, and really don't involve much actual gender changing anyway.

My name is Jo, and I'm 20, AFAB. When I was 14 I had a gender identity crisis. I was flipping out a bit at the mall trying to buy bras and other clothes with my mom. I just broke down and told her I don't feel like a girl. 
I come from a very conservative family and ended up just dropping it and shoving it deep down for the next six years. 
I recently came out as bisexual (I'm also demisexual). This sort of allowed me to be more open minded with myself. For the past six years I've still felt not entirely female, but I haven't felt male. It hasn't been something extremely bothersome, and it hasn't been constantly nagging at me for the past several years, but it's come up plenty of times. Enough for me to kind of question things. I just don't always feel quite like myself.

2020-09-26 22:51:25,j0folt,2,1,"Hi. 

Recently, (\~1 month)  I've been considering my gender identity in a way I haven't before. Up to now I just thought of, and presented myself as a cishet man. However, I've started to have a growing doubt about whether I *feel* male, and I've realised I don't, at least not completely. 

The thorny part is the fact that, that's it, basically. I plan to use he/him for the foreseeable future, I'll keep my masculine-esque name and all that. As a result, I can't actually tell if I'm non-binary or if it's just a case of wanting to be special/not a cishet white dude. 

As a result, I'm trying to get to the bottom of the matter, and so I'm asking for different people's perspectives. Is this similar to other's experiences? Are there any suggestions for resources I should pursue?

2020-09-27 14:48:05,j0sbc9,4,1,"am i the only one who doesn't feel comfortable with their own style??

my general aesthetic is somewhere in the punk/emo/goth corner and it tends to be more fem-leaning, but i'm afab and agender and i hate being seen as a girl because it makes me SUPER dysphoric.  i have an entire pinterest board of outfits and clothes that i'd love to wear, but the thing is, i don't feel comfortable in dresses or skirts or crop tops or even jewelry, and i don't think i will feel comfortable until i can medically transition.

i'm supposed to start testosterone soon (as soon as my psychiatrist finishes writing my letter of readiness) and i'm really, really excited.  i know it'll take some time to see changes, but this feels like a huge step in the right direction.  i want to feel comfortable in my own skin and wear the clothes i want without constantly being perceived as a girl.

I am interested in microdosing testosterone. There are some changes (I will list below) that I am really excited about and some I really don't want. I know you can't 100% predict or control the outcome of starting T, but I was curious if anyone could answer my questions.

Questions:

What changes happened quickly for you and by how much (ex. a lot/little bit of facial hair right away?) What changes happened after a longer usage period and how long did it take for those changes to occur? If you have the patience to create a timeline, I would love that! Is it possible to control some changes? Maybe by taking something else in addition to T, starting and stopping based on desired effects or starting for a certain amount of time then stopping?

&amp;#x200B;

Changes I look forward to:

\- deeper voice

\- body fat redistribution

\-  body mass increase

\- loss of periods

\- more defined face (less baby face)

I've recently come out as non-binary/genderfluid after thinking I was only a queer man who did drag for many years.

I want to polish my style more now as I'm starting a second job where I need to look a touch more professional but also have more creativity.

I'm 5'10""/178cm, 340lbs/154kg, and pretty doughy.

I've been living life as a man in t-shirts, polos and sweaters, and shorts and jeans. In drag, I'm used to wiggle, fit and flare, and maxi dresses.

I need to wear mostly black, but I can have accents of colour. I'm drawn to more feminine fashion but know that it can be hard to pull off as I'm very square in shape, and very rotund in volume.

What pieces give off more of a non-binary feel, and what silhouette would you recommend?

How about hair and makeup?

Accessories?

When I was going through puberty, I just sort of shut down and pretended it wasn't happening for about a year?

But on the other hand, they look really good? I look great in crop tops/tank tops/low cut tops/whatever, and I like the way I look in those. Sometimes I actually like my chest (Why I might be genderfae), so I'm wondering if I'm just fooling myself into being okay with it.

But then I have to go to some formal event and suffer through wearing a dress for a few hours, because even if I choose it myself and I look good in it, it never feels right?

would anyone here who's taken T and then stopped or considered stopping mind sharing their experience or advice? I've been struggling for months now with whether to keep taking it or not.

I started T in May 2018. I've been on and off, at various does, since then. I'm at a point now where I feel like if I'm going to stop for now, it would be a good time. Part of me wants to stop because I'm scared of my hairline changing, more fat redistribution, more facial hair, and ""passing as male"". I'm just not sure if I'm ready for that, or if I want that. Part of me also wants to keep taking it because some changes, like the way my face looks now, voice, energy levels, etc. feel SO much better now. I'm genderfluid and I never feel ""binary"", but how I feel changes day by day and even throughout the day. Keeping up feels exhausting, and I'm not sure what to do about my hormones so I feel more at home more of the time.

For me, there's pros and cons of both staying on T and stopping, so I've been trying to weigh out which pros feel better and which cons feel worse. In theory this might work, but in reality, I think trying to rationalize with it so much is making me feel worse and more disconnected from my inner self/gender and whatever it is I actually want/need. I'm just not sure what to do. Whenever I stop T, I constantly think about taking it again, and whenever I'm on T, I constantly think about stopping. Always worrying about whatever the situation is.

So im a whole mess. I’m an amab person, and rn i identify as nb bc I’m not really sure how i feel, i just know i don’t feel cis. I’m not out to anyone but a few close friends.
Anyway my biggest issue is I feel trapped and not really in healthy social situations almost all the time.

I’m an electrician, and i kinda understood going into the field that I’d run into a lot of queer phobic people, but I’m going on almost 10 months now w the same company and almost everyone i meet is a complete jerk with awful politics. It’s just kind of unbearable sometimes.
I want to experiment but with my limited time it’s near impossible and I’m afraid of someone clocking me as queer. I want to change my hairstyle and unlearn mannerisms but my bosses and coworkers have made fun of people for those same things and for less.

I have the potential to join the electrical union rn, but I’m worried it’s going to be the same and then I’ll have to start over again w a different company, at potentially lower pay. When i went to trade school i only met one semi-queer-friendly person but even he would make homophobic jokes to his friends.

I’m wondering if anyone here has done contracting work, in the electrical field or other trades, and if they’ve had better experiences? If there’s some states that are better than others?
I’m just so tired of not feeling like i can be myself, I’m constantly so fake with others I don’t feel like I can be me sometimes, and my fake persona bleeds into my home life.

I know that’s all a lot; any help ya’ll can offer would be appreciated

2020-09-30 15:29:52,j2oaov,1,1,"This is a very messy text and I swear a bit.

Hello, this is my first time posting on reddit so I hope I don't do anything wrong. Also, English isn't my first language so I hope isnt too bad (:

I'm 19, last year I started college so I moved to the city where I study, even tho I still came home every weekend. But since quarentine I've been home, and being far from home in a place where people accept me (im an art student so it was pretty easy to find friends who were 100% supportive), made me realise I can't keep living like this, hiding myself from my parents without telling them the truth, it hurts me everyday.

But its extremely complicated, my family is complicated. I only have contact with my brothers (3 older brothers) and my parents, the family its a mess, my uncles, grandma and etc hurted my parents a lot, so I never make contact with them. 

\-My older brother its transphobic and thinks ""XX"" and ""XY"" its the absolute truth;

\-my dad made it clear some years ago (when I first cut my hair short) that he didnt care if short hair made me happy cuz, for him, Im a girl and short hair it's ugly; 

\-my mom never stands for me, even when she hears my brother talking shit about LGBT+ or transgender in front of me (she thinks I'm just an ally even tho I've been saying I'm going to marry a woman since im 12 \[she doesn't even think about lesbian? She just pretends she didn't listened\]), also she supports my trans friend but she constantly says stuff to me like ""you're NOT a boy"";

\-my other two brothers just dont talk with me. 

But even if they're like that, I feel so guilty for not telling them, I feel like I should at least give them the opportunity to decide if they want to respect me or not, even if it hurts me. But at the same I feel like this ain't gonna help or make it better. Im so confused, Im always in this battle with myself, cuz I can't take it anymore but I can't afford seing my family getting destroyed, I already don't have much, I don't want to lose it all. Just thinking about it makes my whole body hurts.

And more than that, I feel like they're gonna make a lot of excuses about ""why I'm not trans"" just because Im extremely feminine, I love using ""feminine clothes"" such as skirts, and it took me a long time to accept that my clothes dont make me less a man, but even so, I still use ""masculine clothes"" because im scared of someone saying that ""if you like that then you're just confused"". I dont know how to tell my mom that even tho I use a skirt, I still see a boy, a feminine boy, in the mirror, that I feel beautiful but then I cry because everyone sees that just as a confused girl. That I just wished that I had born a cis feminine man. That I cry all the time because I feel like I'm never gonna be able to be myself. That im so scared to disappoint them.

I already tried to write my mom two letters (one with the came out and another one with some tips about trans people in case she decides to support me), but even if I give her that, that aint gonna change things with my dad. Or my brother. Right now my dad doesnt even look at me cause i have pink hair. 

&amp;#x200B;

I dont know how to tell my mom that even tho I use a skirt, I still see a boy, a feminine boy, in the mirror, that I feel beautiful but then I cry because everyone sees that just as a confused girl. That I just wished that I had born a cis feminine man. That I cry all the time because I feel like I\'m never gonna be able to be myself. That im so scared to disappoint them.\n\nI already tried to write my mom two letters (one with the came out and another one with some tips about trans people in case she decides to support me), but even if I give her that, that aint gonna change things with my dad. Or my brother. Right now my dad doesnt even look at me cause i have pink hair. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf someone knows what i should do or haves any tip to calm down my anxiety I would appreciate a lot.

anyway

\------------

ok so me and a few friends of mine were sitting at a table in school on lunch break minding our own businesses when a group of 4 students came a long and told us about how ""lgbt doesnt exist"" and how ""gender is based on appearance"".

(now, we did nothing to those students, we were just on our table talking to eachother when this all happened)

one student was like ""do you have a cock?"" ""you have a dick right? yeah cuz your a guy"" and im just sat here like ""does it matter if i do? im who i am and you cant change that""

my friends were mad tho, they were battering them on about stuff and how transphobic they were, how homophobic they were, all that. and i was sat there not saying anything because theres like 1% chance of me getting offended by something and those things are my triggers so i literally wasnt offended. i can see how people can be tho, dont get me wrong. but yeah i was just sat there like ""yeah uh i disagree with you now go fuck off"" 

a few other students from other tables started defending us and yelling at the students being anti-lgbt and such.

one even had to explain what being nonbinary means which is pretty simple imo but they werent having it. they were saying how ""it doesnt exist"" and ""its pretty idiotic"" all that shit.

soon enough a teacher came along and separated them from us and making sure they didnt come back.

the same teacher was started asking us about what they were saying so they could, yknow, report it and such.

""you have a dick right? yeah cuz your a guy"" and im just sat here like ""does it matter if i do? im who i am and you cant change that""\n\nmy friends were mad tho, they were battering them on about stuff and how transphobic they were, how homophobic they were, all that. and i was sat there not saying anything because theres like 1% chance of me getting offended by something and those things are my triggers so i literally wasnt offended. i can see how people can be tho, dont get me wrong. but yeah i was just sat there like ""yeah uh i disagree with you now go fuck off"" \n\na few other students from other tables started defending us and yelling at the students being anti-lgbt and such.\n\none even had to explain what being nonbinary means which is pretty simple imo but they werent having it. they were saying how ""it doesnt exist"" and ""its pretty idiotic"" all that shit.\n\nsoon enough a teacher came along and separated them from us and making sure they didnt come back.\n\nthe same teacher was started asking us about what they were saying so they could, yknow, report it and such. \n\nim hoping this doesnt happen again, and if it does idk what id do but i\'ll do something.\n\n\\--------\n\nthis was kinda a vent post, i apologize but i just had to get it out somewhere.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'anti-lgbt in school', 'created': 1601526551.0}"
