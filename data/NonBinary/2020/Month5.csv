I come here in need of some advice and support. Recently, I reentered the dating pool. Due to everything going on with COVID, the dates have been virtual, but fairly frequent as folks seem to have a lot of free time because of everything going on.

I've been extremely choosy when it comes to potential romantic partners of any sort, so it surprised even me when a cis guy on Tinder matched with me. He also identifies as straight. We hit it off really well and found that we have a lot in common. I find him extremely attractive, which also definitely helps. Once the restrictions are lifted, I'm hoping to meet up and see where things go.

The thing that's been eating away at me is that he identifies as both cis and straight. I don't mind so much the fact that he is cisgender as this isn't my first rodeo with a non-trans person, but the fact that he's also straight is a lot to wrap my head around since he's not dating a cis woman, he's dating an AFAB enby. I know that just because he identifies a certain way doesn't negate my own queer identity, but I can't help but feeling off about it, especially when I've begun mentioning him to my queer friends and they've reacted rather uncomfortably.

Once the restrictions are lifted, I'm hoping to meet up and see where things go.\n\nThe thing that's been eating away at me is that he identifies as both cis and straight. I don't mind so much the fact that he is cisgender as this isn't my first rodeo with a non-trans person, but the fact that he's also straight is a lot to wrap my head around since he's not dating a cis woman, he's dating an AFAB enby. I know that just because he identifies a certain way doesn't negate my own queer identity, but I can't help but feeling off about it, especially when I've begun mentioning him to my queer friends and they've reacted rather uncomfortably.\n\nI suppose my question (and the TL;DR) is: how do y'alls who are dating/have dated cis/straight folks feel secure in your own identities while doing so?"", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Dating cis/straight as an enby', 'created': 1588349065.0}"

i think I'm questioning my gender.

my sex is female, and although I'm not particularly curvy you can kind of tell I have a female body. my name is female and I've always used she/her pronouns. which I don't really have a problem with. but also... I don't really **feel** female... whatever that means.

like, my gender expression has always been pretty androgynous. and although I don't really care about transitioning to a different body type, I don't think I'm a female when it comes to gender.

I've done a lot of research, and now I'm even MORE confused. am I nonbinary? am I agender? am I a demigirl? I feel fine with any pronouns, whether its she, he, or they. its almost as if my gender is ""not giving a fuck about my gender"". 

am I crazy? do I have a reason to question? if anyone on here is willing to talk to me and give me advice on this, it would be greatly appreciated.

I just feel like sharing something :-)

So over the last week I really started to accept myself and ordered  a lot of clothes to find out what I like and how I might want to present. It was so much fun and I loved it! It's so funny and unbelievable to me, how clothing can make me so happy! I supressed this part of me for so many years and also judged myself so harshly for it. And I think a lot of anxiety I experienced rooted from that. It feels so good to finally integrate this side of me into my life.

So I had a date today with a woman and we did a scavenger hunt together. We had a great time and I was really confident and just being myself! I shared embarassing stories about my self, made a lot of Jokes and also said some weird things, which popped up in my mind. Normally these things don't come so easily to me.

&amp;#x200B;

It made so much sense and validated by own feelings that I'd had all my (very suppressed) life, of being way more into women's beauty and fashion than 95% of men that I'd met. (I'm M28)

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, when I accept the idea that my physical body developed as a male, while my brain developed as a female, then it helps me feel safer and more confident to express my more feminine side. ...

&amp;#x200B;

It also helps me realize that committing to identifying as trans person, and maybe getting a full transition done, is one of maybe a few different options available to me. (I respect all people and all healthy ways of self-expression)

&amp;#x200B;

I personally have decided that, at least for now, I'm not going to transition to being a female. So, instead, I'm interested in using:

&amp;#x200B;

(1) cross-dressing in private

&amp;#x200B;

(2) starting an anonymous (not showing my face or name) fashion youtube channel as a ""non-binary"" where I can act as feminine as I want, and

&amp;#x200B;

(3) feminizing my entire look without intending to actually appear to be female (aka, dressing with lots of pink, ear-ring studs, and cute hair with bangs on one side).

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I wonder if anyone else resonates with the concept of addressing gender dysphoria without making a full transition to be the perceived gender? ... When I work out and get higher testosterone level naturally, for example, the following 3-4 hours feel comfortable to express myself as a male, which make sense. But, maybe later that night, I'll have feminine feelings again and would want to cross dress or watch youtube videos about: makeup tutorials, female fashion ideas, and other types of ""girl talk"".

2020-05-03 07:17:54,gcmgbv,1,1,"      So I've been questioning my gender for a while and tbh I still kind of am. I am going back and forth between gender fluid and non binary but I can for sure say I don't identify as a binary gender. 
    I was looking at non binary tik tok compilations on YouTube in a desperate attempt to figure out my gender. I saw one where someone who is afab with longer hair, that isn't allowed to cut their hair short, put their hair into a beanie and made the ends of their hair stick out of the beanie, to make it look like their hair is short.
     I was bored so I tried it with a cap and showed my sister. I thought she would laugh but she said ""Ew it looks gross"".
    I was confused and asked her why it was gross and she said she didn't like it because the ""bangs"" looked ugly. I asked her if it would look good if the ""bangs"" looked better and she said no.
    I kept asking her why she didn't like it and she just kept saying she didn't like the way it looked on me. Ik she most likely meant that she doesn't like it because the way I did it probably didn't look good, but what she said makes me scared to eventually come out when I figure out my gender. I think one of the worst parts is that I really liked how I looked with short hair despite always wanting to have longer hair. 
     Now I'm kind of paranoid to come out to my family because I don't know what their reaction would be. I'm probably over thinking what she said and reading too much into it but I can't help it.

I got a reduction about 8 years ago from a 34 J/K cup size to a 34 C (wanted smaller but Dr was worried about it caving in). I had assumed at the time my dislike of my body stemmed from dysmorphia, not dysphoria. I am tiny (5ft) and the massive breasts were not only a constant source of physical pain but mental trauma.

Of course, while the reduction helped incredibly, I realized shortly after that something was still wrong. I regret not getting a full removal but now I'm not sure what's possible.

So does anyone have experience with this? Photos of the results would be super appreciated. I got a keyhole with anchor for the reduction but I keep seeing these beautiful photos of peri/keyhole surgeries on here with no scars and I'm hella jealous!

The reaction was great and they said yes, but now I'm stressed about the wording.

The person I emailed told IT to add: ""non cis-gender/Do not gender identify"" which is wording they had used before on marketing surveys.

Also, IT needs a letter to designate this in the system. They suggested ""X"" but are open to whatever. They made the point that ""N"" is that it is too close to M and may be misread. I like X but don't know how others may feel.

So, I've been transitioning for awhile, and as an enby it's been interesting/challenging trying to distill for myself (and for others) what the hell is going on. It's hard figuring out what your identity is when there's not really a ""starting place"" other than your assigned gender. 

I like soft butch, but I'm not a lesbian and don't want to co-opt that term. I've been identifying as a boi, but as an AMAB enby... boi can sometimes cause more confusion than clarification when spoken. I sometimes have used tomboi but‚Äîthough I know not all tomboys are rough-and-tumble outdoorsy types‚Äîit still evokes that image for me and I'm definitely not that type of bee.  


Basically, do any of you have any concepts/terms/ideas for an alternative term that would fit a sort of Annie Lennox-meets-Niles Crane type enby presentation (which also doesn't co-opt terms from another community)? Thanks for your time! I hope y'all are doing well and staying safe out there!

Out of that length of time, I've been on hormones for six years and post-op for top surgery for five. Traditionally, I've always presented more on the ""masculine"" side of things, and more hold being openly nonbinary as a thing for queer circles and close friends, as being seen as a trans man was already a *lot* for the conservative state I'm from.

Last year, my spouse and I moved to a more progressive state and I get to be around so, so many badass nonbinary people just living their lives-- this has given me space to think more about being able to openly express my gender more of how I want to express it, and I've been working on doing that. It's wonderful! I've been getting my fashion sense together, using ""they/them"" pronouns more, it's rad.

However, part of this has also been realizing that I think I was going so hard on the being male-coded train that some of the changes from T aren't really what I'm looking for at the moment. I still like having a flat chest, and a slightly lower voice, and the ability to grow facial hair if I want to, but I find myself really wishing I could just be like... right in between where I've been at being on T for six years and how my body was  before medical transition. 

I've talked to my doctor before about getting a hysterectomy and being able to drop my hormone dosage some if I want to (put on pause because of everything going on, unfortunately). But I'm still trying to grasp what all of that would mean, and where I even want to be at.

2020-05-05 00:55:52,gdo1ni,2,1,"First of all, quarantine sure has shit timing. I spent approximately a year questioning my gender identity before it really settled in that yeah, I'm nonbinary, and a few months after that I came out to my closest friends. The thing is that after coming out, my dysphoria started getting worse as I grow more impatient with not getting to be *me*. I'm in my mid-twenties and live with my parents, and while I have a fairly decent relationship with them, we don't really talk about queer things. They know I'm gay but I cannot currently fathom coming out as nonbinary to them, especially while I still live at home (in a conservative-leaning town, albeit in a liberal-leaning midwestern U.S. state).

So I've been hit with an unprecedented amount of dysphoria, sure. The worst part is that I can't identify how to fix it. Not in the sense that my hands are currently tied; the issue is that I have *no idea* how I want to be. It feels like I'm constantly getting hit with conflicting signals. I desperately want to cut my hair short but I can't rn (thanks, lockdown), and I'm understanding of why, but beyond that? I have no clue. I don't even know what kind of clothes feel right to me. I can't really consider my existing wardrobe as a guide, because I haven't always been brave enough to buy or wear what I want and I've been dealing with these conflicting signals since puberty. In the past I shied away from masculine clothes because I knew I didn't want to come off as butch, but now that I know I'm not a woman, who knows. Generally I wear skinny jeans and some sort of not-too-femme-but-still-from-that-section-of-the-store shirt. Like a striped t-shirt. It's really weird looking in the mirror and, with my shoulder-length hair and queer-but-seemingly-cis person outfits, seeing an aesthetically pleasing person but not feeling identified with that person at all. And it's wild because like... I am pretty, in that ordinary but no less valuable way. I look like the person I wanted to be five years ago, when I thought of myself as a queer cis person. And, god, all I wanted for years was to be pretty, but now that I have enough self-confidence to see past my acne and other supposed flaws, I don't necessarily want to be that. I just want to feel like myself. I have no idea how.

Most days I'm just anxious and upset about this, irritable and really squirmy in my skin, but sometimes I feel this hopelessness that I will never, ever figure this out. I've only been out to myself for a year and a half, generously speaking, but I've been trying and failing to just be content as me for over a decade. I suppose I'm just looking for support. There's really no one in my life rn I feel comfortable sharing this with. And if anyone has ever felt similarly to this, please share. 

tl;dr - I know I'm nonbinary, but my dysphoria regarding clothes/presentation feels unsolvable and that's really getting harder to bear. Also lockdown means that I can't get a short haircut, let alone experiment much with clothing, so I'm stuck looking like the girl I know I'm not. Just looking for community, I guess.

2020-05-05 01:56:32,gdoz7h,2,1,"Hi enby folks! I'm new in this sub! I hope everything will be fine!

Idk if I should add the NSFW flair so here's a TW  

Talking about periods here, if you feel uncomfortable, feel free to leave, I don't want to make you feel this way



So I'm ftx and I have problems concerning my periods. As I don't know if this sub fits for that kind of question I'll just ask something related.

So I found a sub that was made to let women talk about their periods. And here's the deal. This sub doesn't seem to acknowledge that enby folks and trans boys can have periods. Now I may just not have seen posts made by trans people but even in the sub's description it says ""women"" (that's why I used this word in the beginning of this paragraph) so I'm not sure that I'll be accepted. But I don't want to hide.

I may just worry too much but I don't want to be an encyclopedia or whatever.

What should I do? Should I go in there and see what happens or should I try to convince my parents to let me see a doctor without even being sure that what I have is abnormal? 

""Why try to convince them?"" some may wonder, well they think that it's my fault if I have this issue. 

While this is a possibility this isn't the only one. But they'll just say something like ""Just eat more and better"" even tho they know that my weight is quite healthy for my height and age and that I can't eat things that I don't like or else I might just end up throwing up (they don't even believe me on any of these points but still, I know it's true, the first one is just what my doctor said and as for the second one, I just experienced it many times.)

I‚Äôm 15, just about to be 16, and I‚Äôm finding myself suddenly questioning my gender. I‚Äôm AFAB and I think I‚Äôm ok with being called a girl (?) but I‚Äôm not exactly sure anymore.

I feel disconnected with womanhood. It‚Äôs hard to describe, but I feel very apathetic about it. If I had to pick one: identifying as a woman or a man, I‚Äôd pick a woman- but I don‚Äôt feel really strong about it. However, I do present myself as highly feminine. That is something I feel strongly about, however, I don‚Äôt see it as being connected to womanhood in any way. But, I‚Äôm also interested in presenting as a mix of neutral and feminine. 

In my mind, I feel very neutral about everything. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd like to be called a man, but who knows. That‚Äôs another weird thing about my gender- I know I don‚Äôt want to be a man but I also would like to get rid/hide some of the things that make me female. For example, I‚Äôve wanted to bind for the past couple of years, I‚Äôve had a heavy urge to. When I was 13, I went through a phase of wanting to present in a masculine way, but it quickly fell through because everyone told me that they see me as a ‚Äúsuper girly girl‚Äù and nothing else. And now, as of late, the thought of using they/them pronouns along with she/her have been interesting me, but I‚Äôve held back on it due to not wanting to be problematic, since I still wonder if I am cis.

So yeah, this is the first time that I‚Äôve thought very deeply about these things- but I have a lot of doubt about it. I‚Äôm worried that I‚Äôm trying to place myself in a space that isn‚Äôt mine, and that I‚Äôm just a cis female who wants to be special. Since I do not particularly feel upset if someone calls me a girl/woman, I wonder if I‚Äôm all faking it. It‚Äôs like, I‚Äôm okay with being called female terms, but I could be called neutral terms, too. I‚Äôd be quite happy with both, actually.

So... thanks for reading if you‚Äôve gotten this far. Do y‚Äôall have tips on how to navigate these weird feelings? Do I sound like I could be nonbinary or am I just pretending?

I've been having a really, really hard time during this covid situation after I had to leave school and come back home to the midwest. My dysphoria, which I didn't even have a ton of to begin with, shot through the roof, and today I had the first dysphoria-induced panic attack ever. I was feeling off all day and tried to bind and do some masc make up and take pictures to help, but when I looked in the mirror all I could see was the feminine/female parts of my body, and when I tried to look at the pictures I started having a full blown attack. 

I'm not gendered correctly here at home, tho I did (unwillingly) come out to my parents before coming home, and they know I prefer they/them pronouns and don't want to be referred to in any feminine way, but I get grouped in with my sister and they often call us ""girls,"" which really really hurts. They also primarily use my deadname, even tho the name I'm using now (Cas) just used to be my nickname, so it's not even anything new or hard. It's messed with my head so much that when my friends gender me correctly now, I don't know who they're talking about.

I have an amazing support system back at school- I live in a primarily LGBT Women's/gender nonconforming house and have so many trans people to communicate with. I realized I was gender nonconforming in January, and they all helped me feel so comfortable and valid, I'm guessing that's why I didn't experience any dysphoria.

I want to go, and I know I will be so much happier there and can (social distantly) see the people who make me feel valid and real. I know it will hurt my family who don't understand...but have they even tried to?

I currently identify as a cis gay man, but my gender is something that has preoccupied me off and on for a while. I was hoping that I could run some of my experiences by you and hear what you think, and whether these are things that resonate with you as a nonbinary person. 

I've always had a bit of a dissociative relationship with my body. Generally I like the way I look, but I've always had a feeling that something might be slightly off. I would say I look at myself in the mirror and feel indifferent, indifferent about my genitals, indifferent about being a ""man."" Again however, I do mostly like the way I look, and it doesn't feel right to me that I would be a trans woman. 

I've always accepted he/him pronouns without much question, but certain monikers, like ""dude"" or ""bro"" definitely make me shudder a little bit. I have considered trying they/them pronouns, but I'm also not really sure how to test them, and am worried about coming out and later having to retract that identity. 

I'm aware this is really many shades of gray and there's no straight answer to this. But I'm struggling to figure out if I'm just a guy who is androgynous and likes being androgynous, or if I am some inflection of nonbinary/gender-nonconforming. And I'm not sure how I can figure that out.

2020-05-06 13:54:44,gekfp6,1,1,"There's a lot of things that came up and some asks/discussions make me really want to re-question myself. I've been trying to figure out if I'm an NB that leans more towards masc or if I could just be a transman. I like being addressed or referred to with masculine pronouns and titles (he/him, guy, boy, sir, brother) and presenting as masculine. I'm totally fine with being seen as a male, in fact, that makes me happy. I do have times where the fact I have breasts kind of plague my mind. I don't always mind having breasts because they're small and they can be hidden fairly easily with just a baggy shirt or jacket, but the times I do, I'm not worried about them being noticeable, I just would greatly prefer to not have them. I think about top surgery and the idea makes me feel like that's something I might want in the future, but I feel as if my chest doesn't bother me enough for me to even be qualified to get top surgery. 

And while I either don't mind breasts or mind them, the way I feel when I do mind them isn't that intense compared to how I feel about my genitals. A lot of times, I feel like what I have down there is wrong. Those moments, I think: ""I should be having a penis instead."" But the surgical options available (meta or phallo) don't seem worth it for me. And there are times where I completely detached from my genitals, like with my breasts, where it doesn't bother me as long as I'm not really thinking about it or that it's not something I suddenly become aware of in the moment. Sometimes I feel like if I did transition into a guy, I would be fine just being flat and detached from my genitals. 

But then I rethink about it and realize that, even if I am masculine and feel more connected to the male gender 95% of the time, there's a 4% where I am something else the other times. Not exactly agender, but just ""myself"". And then that 1% where I feel feminine, which is rare. When I feel feminine, I don't exactly connect to the female gender, but more of the concept of femininity itself. Would it be valid/justifiable to transition to a male but still consider yourself genderfluid/fluidflux? I mostly live my life seen as a male or a masculine person. People mostly address me as he/him and consider me more of a male. But the times where I feel that: ""My gender can only be described as myself and not exactly genderless,"" I like they/them as well. I also like being addressed in a gender neutral way. So he/they really makes me feel more like myself. I'm fine with he/him and they/them. I'm fine with presenting as masc or androgynous. But majority of the time, I just am intensely connected to masc and wanting to be seen as male. 

I'm also curious on the affects of Testosterone on Asians. I know that T affects people differently, it really depends on the individual. I'm aware of the effects, which ones are common, which ones are reversible and irreversible. But, genes also play a role in how it affects the person and some of the effects people have had may be because of race. I just want to know what are some different effects T has on Asians (because I'm Asian) compared to Caucasians or African Americans or Latin Americans, if anyone has experiences that differed in anyway from the common effects one would usually hear. I'd love to ask a professional about this, but medical offices are closed and I'd like to hear personal experiences. Such as, instead of a receding hair line or risk hair loss, have you retained the same amount of hair thickness instead and does it seem like the risk of balding isn't as high as some? Was your jawline not as defined or more defined than what most people might commonly have? I hear being on T can make some people's hair turn from straight to curly or even curlier than it was before. Most Asians have been known to have very straight hair, has your hair gotten curlier even if your family has straight hair? Was it always curly and ended up straightening a bit or did it not change at all? I'd like as much information because I'm heavily questioning if I want to start T or not. 

Again, I know it's better to talk about this with a professional, but medical offices are closed and I suppose this is more of my way of trying to hear other's experiences or others feeling similarly to me and what their take on it is.

We‚Äôve been together for 3 years and when we started dating I presented only as fem, knew I was bi, but never questioned my gender. About a year ago I started feeling some gender dysphoria, we moved in together about 9 months ago, I came out as non binary about 6 months ago, and find non binary and they/them pronouns as sort of nice umbrella terms to define myself. The past few weeks I‚Äôve had horrible gender dysphoria that I‚Äôve never experienced before, not being able to have any sort of sexual relations, not wanting to have boobs, not wanting to see myself naked, not wanting to wear any of my fem clothes (which is pretty much all I have).

But he keeps bringing up wanting to get engaged and feels pressure from his fam (who somehow don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm queer and are super queerphobic) to buy me a ring which feels kinda shitty. 

BUT I also know he is super cis and super straight (which is totally cool). I‚Äôm starting to wonder if I was with a queer person, would it be easier to express my gender etc? He supports me when I present more masc, but I‚Äôm kinda scared to do more like buy a binder, cut my hair shorter, etc and what his reaction would really be because he again is 100% straight.

2020-05-07 04:30:51,gezudw,1,1,"I'm Streit (at least, online). 26 years old. Afab. Asexual. 

I guess this is my coming out? Since about the middle of high school, I've described my gender as: Ehhh *hand wiggle*. I've used they/them pronouns for a while, but I don't mind any pronouns. I look female, and most people use she/her for me, and it doesn't bother me as much as I thought ""wrong pronouns"" should. I always tended to rebel against labelling of any kind, and I guess, if I'm good with all the labels, do any of them really apply? I thought if I couldn't be labelled, I couldn't be controlled. Better to be an unknown quantity. As I've grown up, I've found that labels just let you find others like you. A community, I guess.

I know that anyone who recognizes me based on this username will probably be supportive. Jeez, I don't even know anyone on this sub. I'm still twitchy though.

On the last day of school before quarantine, I convinced a friend to lend me a spare skirt, which I wore that day. I was told by a teacher that I 'would receive a lot of negative attention.' This quite annoyed me, as all of the people in my class had a positive reaction. None except my close friends know I'm non-binary, I guess they thought I was wearing drag? My friend came up with an idea to prove to my teachers I wasn't receiving negative attention, and to help with my parents (who had been told by the teachers about me wearing a skirt)  when I got home. The idea was to pass a sheet of paper around the class, that read at the top, \[my name\] should be allowed to wear a skirt, and get everyone to sign it. Before Lunch break, the headmaster and head of PD (Basically about equality and ethical stuff, ironically) took me out of my class and to the headmaster's office, where they basically told me I was wearing a skirt for attention,  and everybody in my class was laughing at me behind my back. I showed them the note, they claimed it was attention seeking (it was another teacher that caused it, and not even my idea). They then told me that since 'they are the best school in \[area where I live\] for dealing with LGBTQ+', they were getting me a gender therapist. I'll get back to that later. They then sent me to internal isolation (Have to stay in one room all day, I've had previous experience with it beforehand and it was horrible). So I didn't get to say goodbye to most of my friends.

Although now boris is talking about sending people back to school, and frankly I'm frightened. I won't stop wearing the skirt, and I suppose I'll see how they react.

Here's why I have a problem with this phrase. 

I've heard this from many people after coming out to them. Both people that are close to me and some that aren't. I've had family members say this, and I've had new acquaintances say this. But most, if not all, times it hasn't sat well with me. I'm making this post because I came out to a new friend a few days ago about being non-binary, and this was the only response I got about it. 

For me, when hearing the phrase ""It doesn't change the way I think of you"", I think one of two things: One, this person is not taking it seriously and will continue to view me the way they always have without considering that I WANT it to change the way they think of me (continuing to use the wrong pronouns or name). Or two, they are choosing to ignore my statement and are deliberately disregarding my identity. 

I completely understand that there are people who say this phrase with the sincere intent to support whoever is coming out about their identity, but it simply doesn't leave me with a sound mind afterwards. It almost feels like a quick way for them to get out of the conversation so they can forget about it as soon as possible.

I didn't see a message about moderator approval for surveys for academic research, but here is a descriptive paragraph about the research scope (more can be found on consent form). Please let me know if you have any additional questions. 

I‚Äôm a student at a US university studying psychology, specifically how psychological factors affect individuals‚Äô health behaviors. If you have time to participate, the survey linked below asks about your attitudes and behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is a pretty comprehensive survey, taking about 20-40 minutes (time is a wide range because many questions are open-ended). As an undergrad, I wish I could compensate everyone for participation, but I'm only able to to a gift card raffle. If you complete the survey and choose to be entered, we will randomly select participants to win gift cards. You will submit any identifiable info (email address for a gift card) through a separate link that is not tied to your responses. We're hoping to recruit a diverse and representative sample, so any help is greatly appreciated!

Our IRB (a regulatory board that protects research participants) has required that I add the following:

A psychology research lab at Loyola University is conducting a study on adults‚Äô (over the age of 35) response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

There's a lot of things that would kind of make sense if I'm bigender, like a couple of years ago I tried deepening my voice even though I already had a kind of deep voice for a girl, and when I was younger I lowkey liked when people would think I'm a guy when I played on xbox live (and I like the thought of that happening again but I don't play online much anymore), but I still also feel like a girl. 

One of the confusing things though is that I'm only attracted to guys but I find it attractive when their body is a little bit feminine, like if their waist kind of goes in and, im just gonna straight up say I like ass. I don't even know if you can be bigender and attracted to one sex lmao but if thats possible I feel like being straight and gay at the same time would be weird.

The main reason I'm questioning whether I'm bigender or not is because I prefer to express myself as female physically but I feel that I think and express emotions in a masculine way.

2020-05-08 18:12:39,gfyb62,5,1,"Hello all you beautiful people! I had some questions about potentially being nonbinary, and what this all means. I would love your thoughts on how to define my gender, and also on ways to 'come out' and be more my true self, as some of my traits contradict themselves and/or don't have an obvious way of expressing them physically. I also suspect that I may lie somewhere on the Autism spectrum - though I have not been officially diagnosed - so it's possible that these are all stemming from that rather than being a gender issue. I honestly don't know.

So, I'm AFAB and I present feminine right now. I feel like I'm somewhere between man and woman... Like, the thought of appearing masculine makes me cringe, but being referred to as 'she' also makes me cringe. Here are some things that make me feel euphoric vs dysphoric:

**Euphoric:**

* Having long hair in a feminine hairstyle
*Having my gender be unknown (like in an online game)
*Being referred to as a man online (not in person)
*Wearing feminine clothing (when it actually fits and is comfortable)
*Having long pubic, armpit, and leg hair 
*Not wearing a bra 
*The thought of having a penis, testicles, WITH a vagina
*Wearing makeup
*Being the only woman in a group of men
*Having conversations with men about hobbies that are traditionally *masculine' in nature (video games, anime)
*Engaging in any 'masculine' activity 
*Peeing outside 
*Having a feminine facial structure
*Having a feminine voice
*They/them or other nonbinary pronouns
*Being called a shortened gender-neutral version of my name 
*Playing any gender in video games
*Seeing nonbinary/trans characters in media
*Being asked to do a 'masculine' task, and doing the task
*Wearing a fake penis
*The thought of having attractive breasts (I don't feel that mine are very attractive)
*Operating as a man, not being asked to help with chores or cook at family gatherings, not being forced to be overly nice to other people or forced to hug them 
*Wearing my boyfriend's clothes, using his deoderant, etc

**Dysphoric:**

*Looking in mirrors
*Being mistaken for a man in real life 
*Being referred to as 'she' 
*Interacting with women at all - it feels very strange 
*Being forced into gender roles (you should wear THIS, Not THIS, don't lift that chair, I'll take care of it as a MAN, shave your body hair)
*The thought of having a penis and testicles but no vagina or breasts
*Being called my full, feminine name
*Hugging people 
*The thought of wearing a binder
*The thought of being pregnant
*Having periods

With that being said, getting my friends to use my pronouns has been difficult, to say the least. They keep using she/her for me even though I have explicitly said multiple times that I want to be referred to as they/them. They also keep referring to me as a girl, which I have told them makes me uncomfortable. When I ask them to change their words, they say they will never do it again, and bring out the ""but I've known you for over ten years, this is too hard!"" speech. Then, as if I never said anything, they go right back to doing the same thing.

Am I selfish for getting upset at them for not referring to me correctly? I have no idea how to get them to use my pronouns.

I've managed to...grudgingly appreciate my chest even if I don't like how it makes me look in clothes. I'm not sure if I'd want all the changes associated with testosterone. And being AFAB does affect my life. I feel a strong connection to queer female communities. Feeling this way, it's been hard not to wonder if I should be open to seeing myself as a woman and living as a cis woman, but that still doesn't feel right, either. I still feel like I'm adopting a costume when I try to think of myself that way. I still feel elated when strangers mistake me for a guy. I still envy transmasculine people who are transitioning, and I still can't really explore how much I'm attracted to men because I feel really envious around guys I find attractive.

I'm fine with identifying as non-binary for the most part, but sometimes I wish I had an end goal and knew if top surgery or hormones were right for me. And I feel like I can't really talk about this in many spaces, because talking about dysphoria lessening over time is like blood in the water for TERFs and gender critical folks.

* I'm not going to actively come out to people, only when they ask about it

* I'm tired of hiding that I'm nonbinary. I'm here, I'm queer, and that doesn't depend on which name or pronouns I use
* I'm not out to my family so I don't want to create two ""bubbles"" where one (my family) uses a different name and pronouns than the other (my friends/classmates). I'm not ready to come out to my family yet, but I'll do it...one day...

I'm 24 and I've always known that I'm different. I'm a biological woman, but I've prefered to play with boys when I was a kid and I've hated pink colour and skirts. My has mum always complained about it and made me feel ashamed because 'she always wanted a daughter and has a son'.  


In teenage years I've been bullied and other girls didn't want talk to me and called me a 'tomboy'. \[I've also discovered I'm falling in love with the girls wich scared me as fuck\] So, I've really tried to 'be a girl' and wear skirts and dresses, but it didn't feel like me, so I've quit.  


Now, I have a girlfriend (my whole family know) and wear a lot of men's clothes, but my style is quite bland. My girlfriend sadly don't like very much when I wear men's stuff because 'she's a lesbian and she like female body and I can't blame her for it, but she knows I'm kind of non-binary and she accepted it\] I'm tall and thin and I have broad sholders. My sholders are wider than my hips but I also want to have a 6-pack and stronger arms. I am inspired by non-binary models on instagram as Vasiliki Halastaras for example ( [https://www.instagram.com/vas.hal/](https://www.instagram.com/vas.hal/)). I have very similar body type. I want also wear cooler clothes, but I'm insecure.  


I'm scared because I feel like I'm disappointing everybody because I always must be a rebel and different. Also it scares me that I'm questioning my gender identity so much that sometimes I don't know  if I want to be a man or not. I don't want to look like a stereotypical woman but I don't feel a need to grow a beard or having a penis. (But sometimes I have a penis in my sexual fantasies and it makes me feel anxious). I don't know what to do to accept the way I am. I don't have a body dismorphic disorder, I don't care about my boobs, I just don't care if I have them or not. I don't have a problem with having a pussy. When I get rid of my acne (which I had since I was thirteen) I even start liking my gender neutral face. But still I feel I don't express myself fully because I'm scared I could start want to be a men (what will ruin my life because being transgender is so fucking hard, especially because I have a conservative family and I live in a traditional country) and I'm scared to be judged by society again. And I don't want to disappoint my girlfirend because she doesn't like 6-packs and big arms.  


I know I'm not this bullied and scared teenager anymore but I wish I was more sure who I am. But I don't feel like a man or a woman and it's confusing.

My research team is examining the effects of COVID-19 on mental health and behaviors. I think that academic studies don't sufficiently (or at all really) reflect the community as a whole because those who do not identify as male or female are often insufficiently represented or not represented/considered at all. Although the study does not directly pertain to gender identity, it would be greatly appreciated if anyone in this group would be interested in filling it out, so that we can represent all gender identities as equally as possible.

Juno Steel is the main character of [The Penumbra Podcast](http://www.thepenumbrapodcast.com/), Junoverse story line. He is a noir detective who solves crimes in a futuristic society on Mars. His pronouns are he/him. He regularly refers to himself as a lady and often goes against traditional gender norms. 

Things I love about this character/show:

\-He is the main character. There‚Äôs no need to sit through three or more seasons just for a minor character with three lines. 

\-He is a human, not an alien or a robot.  

\-He represents a side of being nonbinary that I rarely see in mainstream media: using binary pronouns and not being completely androgynous.   

\-Juno‚Äôs identity is not there for representation points or to create conflict. He just is. 

\-This universe is one where all sexualities and genders are accepted without question. There‚Äôs no homophobia or transphobia. I find it really refreshing to listen to a sci-fi story with LGBT characters where their identity is not the focal point of who they are. 

\-There‚Äôs also so much more quality representation on this podcast. It‚Äôs definitely worth listening to.

2020-05-15 02:35:50,gk0sqe,0,1,"So, with being home basically 24/7 for these past few months (and with animal crossing being such a fun game for clothing lol), I‚Äôve been wanting to actually give myself space to actually explore my nonbinary-ness now that I have the freedom to aesthetically do whatever I want without worrying about how anybody else might react to it. I‚Äôve been pretty psyched to try new things, as I‚Äôve always felt like I haven‚Äôt really ever gotten the chance to just be the boss of myself when it comes to how I want to look.

Weirdly, though, it‚Äôs kind of been an exercise in trying to parse out what I want to look like vs what I‚Äôm used to performing out of fear? Which sucks, and I feel really lost.

For background info, I‚Äôm AFAB, and I‚Äôve identified as nonbinary for the past ~8 years. My home state is pretty conservative, so it was far easier and safer to just come out to everyone who wasn‚Äôt in the local queer community as a trans man and call it a day. Sometimes, when I‚Äôd go to pride events there, I‚Äôd dress up more femininely‚Äî but kind of in a campy drag way, because that felt like *the* way to be nonbinary. I went on T and got top surgery and everything, and that was that.

A little over a year ago, I moved to a way more accepting area and work in an environment where I‚Äôm surrounded by other nonbinary folks. I‚Äôve been able to go by they/them pronouns more, which has felt awesome. I‚Äôd find myself wanting to try more things to find my ideal gender expression in my day-to-day life, but I always got kinda scared out of it by my old safety mechanisms.

During quarantine, I decided to totally go wild and do whatever I want. However, this mostly manifested in going the complete opposite direction and trying to appear as woman-coded as possible, especially if I was going out for groceries or whatever. This felt pretty okay, but then I realized I was doing the exact same thing: wearing stuff that didn‚Äôt feel good or right to avoid people catching onto the fact that I‚Äôm not cis.

I talked with my therapist about it, and he basically gave me a homework assignment to try and figure out where I would want to be regardless of old protective habits. I keep finding myself sort of at a loss, because I just keep returning to the same uncomfortable familiarities. It‚Äôs weird to parse out how much of the way I present‚Äî ever‚Äî is me, and how much of it is just wanting cis people to like me.

TL;DR: I‚Äôm trying to figure out how I want to look/be referred to/etc, but I‚Äôm too bogged down by years of red-state cisnormativity to know where to start now that I have the freedom to.

I told my boyfriend, and fair enough, he said if I were trans (as in transitioning to the opposite gender) that he wouldn't date me because he wouldn't be attracted to that gender, which I very much understand and respect. He shouldn't have to change his sexuality for me, and whatever choice he makes about it I wouldn't hold it against him. However, I think genderqueer really threw him for a loop. He just doesn't understand it. And since then, he will not use they them, or even use neutral words like person, or partner. He has told all of his friends i am my AGAB, and when I have tried to correct him, he ignores it and continues to almost intentionally misgender me. I haven't said anything because I was hoping to just avoid the whole thing, but lately it really makes me frustrated, especially being at home where no one knows I'm nb, and i don't know if people in my family would respect that.

He shouldn't have to change his sexuality for me, and whatever choice he makes about it I wouldn't hold it against him. However, I think genderqueer really threw him for a loop. He just doesn't understand it. And since then, he will not use they them, or even use neutral words like person, or partner. He has told all of his friends i am my AGAB, and when I have tried to correct him, he ignores it and continues to almost intentionally misgender me. I haven't said anything because I was hoping to just avoid the whole thing, but lately it really makes me frustrated, especially being at home where no one knows I'm nb, and i don't know if people in my family would respect that. I'm starting to feel like I should maybe just tell him we should be friends, but I also wonder if it's worth the effort to correct him and sit down and talk with him. What can I say to be firm, but kind, about correcting him and others?"", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'I could use some pronoun advice.', 'created': 1589547193.0}"

When I was growing up, my older brother learned guitar and I learned drums. It was and still is a great artistic output, and we've even formed a band and played on stage in the past. If anyone is unaware of this, drumming is very much thought of as a masculine thing, which I can only laugh at because it's the thing that tied me most closely to my most accepting friends.

At the same time though, it bugs me a little - I always feel very much like when I'm performing it's either a neutral or fluid action, in terms of how it might reflect my gender, but I feel like people are inferring it as a male thing, which can be annoying (like why must the fact that I'm hitting things with sticks be inherently more ""masculine"" than if I were playing a classical strings instrument, for example?).

2020-05-16 08:25:09,gkr8dc,0,1,"I had a nightmare last night that involved someone I used to be close to. He was sort of my dom, I guess you could say. He turned out to be a ""bad person""(for lack of a better word). I won't get into the details of why he was a ""bad person"" but I cut off contact with him in 2017. Unfortunately, I have nightmares about twice a week usually related to childhood trauma, dysphoria, stress dreams, etc.  I'm not sure why he appeared in this particular recent nightmare.

In this nightmare I was having a video Skype call with him(as we used to do if were weren't hanging out in person). A lot of the times(in waking life) when we had skype calls, it would involve dom/sub sexual commands. In the nightmare, I was trying to discuss my chest dysphoria with him through the video call. I only had a towel on and somehow I accidentally briefly exposed my chest(as most dreams go, it didn't really make sense, it just happened somehow).

so I've recently come to terms with the fact that I am nb. it's been a roller coaster but I've finally put a name to what I've been feeling.

the only problem is my girlfriend. I have been with her almost 4 months and finally got the courage to come out to her. but she's confused. which is understandable because from what she knows she's been dating a girl for four months. she seems to think that I've completely changed and that she needs to ""get to know [me] all over again"". I've tried to explain that I'm still the same person (I am even going by the same name because I've had an inkling that I wasn't my AGAB for a long time). all I've really said is that I want to use they/them pronouns.

my best friend (who's trans himself) got me a ""trans teen survival guide"" and I've offered for her to read that and said she can ask me any questions she needs to but she says she doesn't want to upset me in asking anything, even though I've said it's fine.

I'm just a bit lost, I guess and was hoping that someone could give me some advice if they've been in a similar situation before?

I explained that as a cis-het male I have never had my existence challenged so I have no personal attachment to any pronouns. That being the case I honestly don't care what people call me and am happy for other people to assign me pronouns based on what makes them comfortable.

My friend told me I was being extremely privileged and wasn't helping, that I had to put something on my social media bios to help normalize it.

Is this normal? I realised I was trans about five years ago (I'm AFAB) and went through a ftm gender transition. Two years on t and top surgery a year ago. I was so uncomfortable as a woman and so euphoric when I could finally transition but now I'm starting to question that (I'm 26 and my life is finally going ok)

My fiance is AMAB and recently came out to me as NB, he presents like a long haired bearded femme guy and uses he/him pronouns. I'm wondering if I might be the same? Or if maybe I'm kind of fluid and feeling like a girl sometimes? 

The scariest thought is that I might regret transitioning. I'm not buying into the TERFy bs and I know it's really uncommon to genuinely regret it. But I'm wondering if I might and what to do if so. I'd just be a girl without boobs and with a deeper voice, but now I feel so good with my new muscles and broad shoulders and narrower hips and more angular build. I used to be super curvy and hated it. But in saying that I've had an ED for 15 years and I'm wondering if I wasn't dysphoric so much as dysmorphic. 

I'm wondering if it's partially because I had such nicer interactions with queer women than queer men. I know it's not representative but the queer men I've known have rarely been decent whereas most queer women are amazing. I'm bi and identified as a bi woman for about five years. I miss the solidarity of queer women compared to the pettiness and nastiness and judginess of the queer men I know. 

Does anyone have any advice? Have any of you been through anything similar? I thought I was finally done doubting myself but now it's back again and I don't know what to do.

I'm a bit of a lurker (on another account), but made this one in the interest of not tying too much of my real life identity with my Reddit identity.


The story I'm sharing here explores an extremely flawed and sometimes offensively crappy protagonist through non-binary lenses There's a fantastical, sometimes surreal element to the way they navigate the confusing feelings they have towards communication and relationships. I hoped to capture the jarring nature of love, and some of the divide between my parent's generation and this one.

It's maybe a little over-ambitious, absolutely self serving and obnoxiously pretentious. I'm hoping you'll like it, or even better, relate to it. 

Anyway, if this is allowed, here is the link to the Kindle edition on Amazon. If ya'll are interested but 99 cents is too much, I would be glad to share the free version in a few months!

2020-05-18 00:22:42,glqu3b,5,1,"So I cam out as ENBY in February, and honestly it's been the most freeing experience of my life.

But in these last few month of Quarantine I have been really struggling:

TDLR: I would like to present as more of a Femboy but I am scared I will regret the transition. I want to know how other people have felt or what advice they'd give.

I've been very lucky in my life to live fairly apart from gender. My mother is a very masc energy in my home, and my Father took on all the traditionally feminine roles. I went to an All Girls school, so I did all of my puberty years without any gender dynamics, and I played games, scouts and sports all through my schooling. I have PCOS and Ovarian cysts, so I have never had natural periods in my life. I have small boobs, and a loud fashion taste. I have never cared what people think about me, despite living in a very sheltered community.

 I didn't stop to question my gender until I came away to University, after having only Monogamous Heterosexual relationships, I opened up and started exploring my Poly responsibly for the first time. 

Having relationships with women, ENBY and fellow Queers made me feel so much more comfortable than I had felt before. They didn't have expectations for my body, or my gender expression. I started growing my body hair out, working out more and cut my long hair short. I was using toys, and experiencing euphoria from having a penis in sexual encounters. And I felt unstoppable. I even felt attractive with no makeup on, and started using a gender neutral name to ease the dysphoria.

But since being trapped inside for the last two months, my self image has been deteriorating. I've been installing fake dreads to give me my long hair back, not being able to look at myself in the mirror as I gain a lot of my weight back. I've found some solace in dressing and trying to pass masc, even with my fat face. But with longer hair and no facial hair I just feel like and ugly girl, and it's making me feel very dysmorphic.

I've always struggled with eating disorders, and I am suddenly scared that all of this journey has been fueled by my dysmorphia and not dysphoria. I was considering starting T, but I am terrified to start and then detransition at some point. There are lots of things I love about my natural body that I will loose if I transition, and lots of things I cannot change unless I do.

I understand that there are no rules, and the flexibility of expression ENBY gives me has been the truest blessing of all. But I feel very lost and scared about making decisions that will put me in a worse situation overall. I just wondered if anyone had any words of advice they could give me? Or if they had experienced anything similar on their journey. Thanks for trawling through my braindump :)

2020-05-18 07:33:41,glwxyq,0,1,"As the title says, lol. I am not sure this rant will make a lot of sense but I need to talk about it somewhere.
I have been dealing with depression and dysphoria both for a very long time now, and of course both of them have their ups and downs etc. But, for all of 2019 I HATED my job. This January I got laid off, but started a new job in March. It's a good job with good benefits.

I have been basically out as non-binary and using he/him pronouns and a chosen name as well for a few years now. I use that name at work too, but nobody in my life (aside from my online friends and my sister) ever actually use my pronouns). 

Lately I have been having ridiculous amounts of dysphoria and intense dissatisfaction with my appearance and way I am able to present myself. I also recently changed my chosen name, but I haven't told anyone irl because quite frankly, it was difficult enough to get them to use the first one (some still don't). But I'm becoming increasingly uncomfortable with that name, and it's ability to also be misconstrued into more feminine names too. 

Normally dysphoria has always kinda been there in the background and reared its head in bursts. Now, though, it's almost always there and I have to actively push it aside to try and focus on other things. I'm thinking maybe it might be because with this new job and insurance it feels like I have a sliver of a chance of DOING something about it, though I'm not sure how much I can really do. 

Also, I have a binder and I think binding more often would help, except... Well, I guess I probably have back and/or lung problems because it's kinda painful and hard to breathe with it on for too long. It's just uncomfortable to wear any undergarment up top, if you catch my drift.

Lately I've been trying (and failing, so far) to try to get in to see a therapist. That's mostly due to my insurance website(s) being ridiculously stupidly set up. I want one who is LGBT allied and deals in these issues so I'm kind of set on a select few that I've found. 

Even if I get in, I don't know if they could really help me in the dysphoria/transition department. I KNOW I want top surgery, desperately. But normally with that you have to be on T for a certain amount of time and truth be told, I'm afraid to go on it at all. I really would like a lower voice but, between hair growth (especially facial-- I already have a big tendency to pull out what facial hair I already get, as it's something that does weird sensory things to me I guess), and, uh, bottom growth squicking me out I'm just scared I will hate it, and I know some things are irreversible. (My hair is also thinning as it is, so there's that).

I've felt this way for a long time, but at this point I have moments where I'm just like ""f*ck it"" and want to just do it if it means I don't ever get called ""ma'am"" or ""she"" again because it truly just feels so Wrong, y'know?

2020-05-18 22:16:09,gmbkz3,1,1,"Hey everybody,

I'm new here, and need some advice. So here's the scenario (I'll make this brief)

I'm a pansexual who is half out on that front and not at all out on the NB front. I've got a pretty gender-neutral name (Jamie), so that's not too much of a problem, and I'm mostly okay with all pronouns (They/Them is by far the best though). It's only been about 2 weeks since any of my non-binary feelings came to light (sorry for the bad working, I have a problem where I write/speak clumsily and than critique myself for it), but I tend to move quickly and in my own way (this will sound weird, but ""my way"" of questioning and affirming my feelings involve lots and lots of research into the potential topic, in this case the NB identity, and watching hours of youtube/tiktok content made by creators who are in that group), I have basically affirmed my feelings 90%. I've been conversing with one of closest friends and with my therapist, but I still have trouble understanding the community and ""breaking"" the gender binary, and my extension, myself (again sorry for the clumsy wording). I need some way to really affirm myself, as my base-level programming that's been beaten in to me from an early age is screaming at me in my head that I'm an idiot for even thinking about this stuff, and even more of an idiot for starting to self-identify with it. I've changed the way I present myself and dress as an experiment, and it seems to have helped; my normally dead-zero confidence levels took a slight uptick. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I'm  feeling really bad about myself and the identity that I'm trying to align myself with due to the irrational screaming of my lizard brain and would like some way to affirm them.

&amp;#x200B;

I am having a bit of a dilemma with my family. I am non binary and recently came out to my family and changed my pronouns to they/them. The only  problem with it is that my niece who is 4 always asks me if i am a boy or a girl. I always hesitate and lead her off course and give her a roundabout answer. 

Is this gender concept to hard right now to introduce?

2020-05-20 04:44:53,gn4v85,3,1,"Hi!! Okay, so, context: I‚Äôm AFAB and have identified as non-binary for about 3 years now. My body is and has always been ridiculously feminine: high voice, wide hips, big boobs, chronic baby face, etc. Probably ~6ish months ago I found out about low dose testosterone as a way to androgynize a bit and I immediately fell in love with the idea. I‚Äôve done loads of research and have pretty much accepted all the big things about not being able to control my results, talking to my doctor, etc, and I‚Äôm genuinely excited at the prospect of everything. If it were solely up to me, I‚Äôd be slapping on Androgel as we speak.

My problem is my job. I work for a really small, really tight-knit company, and all of my coworkers are extremely conservative. I‚Äôm already one of the only AFAB people there and am super deep in the closet there in regards to both my sexuality and gender. 

On one hand, I‚Äôm convinced I can get away with starting low-dose t and keeping my job. I‚Äôm not a talkative person to begin with and I work alone probably 5 out of 8 hours a day, usually wearing super baggy clothes and covered in grime from job-related stuff. My coworkers and supervisors do pop in and work with me occasionally, but even the slightest hint of ‚Äúgirly stuff‚Äù (dating, periods, clothes, etc) changes the subject immediately so I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd bring it up if they did notice any body changes. I started wearing a binder a few months ago and no one has made any comments or seemed to notice at all. They‚Äôre also all older, so I‚Äôm not sure they know transitioning is a thing, and I‚Äôm planning to shave any obvious facial/body hair and keep my long hairstyle to keep things relatively subtle. My hope is that this reluctance combined with the gradual-ness of the changes (I see them every day so it‚Äôs not like anything would be sudden, including voice deepening) and general lack of seeing me look ‚Äúlike a girl‚Äù even now will keep me safe for at least a while.

On the other, I can‚Äôt emphasize how fired I would be if they somehow found out I was anything other than cishet. I live in a ‚Äúfire at-will‚Äù state in the US and have no means to contest it if they decide I‚Äôm out. I‚Äôm trying to be hopeful but am also 100% acknowledging that I could be fooling myself just because I want it so bad. 

I‚Äôm fully ready to be told I‚Äôm an idiot for even considering it, so don‚Äôt hold back. Thanks in advance to anyone with answers/advice!!

2020-05-21 05:34:57,gnr1du,5,1,"So, due to ""the current situation"" I \[22AFAB\] have come home from college until the campus opens back up, so I've been living with my mom. I had recently started experimenting with my gender expression, and I didn't really stop when I moved in. My mom's like, slightly homophobic (by which I mean I'm bi and she was mad about it at first and now we just don't talk about it, but she just hopes I marry a man and forget about my attraction to women, but she's not outright mean about anything) so I don't really want to bring up gender to her, but I also didn't really worry about outing myself to her since I kinda thought she would never suspect that I might be trans/nonbinary

But, lately I've started to worry that she's catching on. Here's a list of things I've said/done around her that might hint to my gender questioning 

\- I pin my hair up in a hat to make it look like I have short hair

\- I wear clothes my brother-in-law kindly let me have when I started wanting to present more masculine (and my mom knows they're his clothes)

\- I bind sometimes, which I thought she wouldn't notice because it doesn't make *that* big of a difference, but the other day I felt like she was staring at my chest area for a while

\- one day at dinner, a distant family friend came up who has recently started making a podcast, featuring their gender dysphoria. My mom asked ""what is gender dysphoria anyway?"" and I jumped into a long winded explanation of my understanding of it, including examples from trans youtubers I watched, and explaining other trans terms like ""stealth."" After this, I promptly finished eating and left the room. 

\- I had a virtual meeting with my counselor, and my mom was out of the house for some of it, but I know she got home before I finished and I don't know how soundproof the walls of my house are and she maybe overheard me talking to my counselor about not being a woman....

\- we went to get haircuts today, and I told the hair dresser to cut mine ""as masculine as possible, please"" and I *know* my mom heard me say that, and afterward she told me it looked really good, when historically she's always been upset whenever I or my sisters cut our hair short (just a few weeks ago she was asking if I was every going to grow my hair out)

\- After the haircuts, she was uncharacteristically nice to me.  (But then she sent me a scripture about obeying God's prophets so... idk)

Anyway, I have no idea if she's catching on and I'm not really ready to come out as anything since I'm still just trying to figure out what the heck gender is, but I don't know.

Should I bring it up?",NonBinary,I'm worried my mom knows I'm not cis!??!!?!,1590064497.0,"{'created_utc': 1590039297, 'id': 'gnr1du', 'num_comments': 5, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'So, due to ""the current situation"" I \\[22AFAB\\] have come home from college until the campus opens back up, so I\'ve been living with my mom.

**June 3 from 12 p.m.‚Äì1 p.m. EST**

Join the Fenway Trans Health Team for live Q&amp;A sessions on gender-affirming care.

Navigating gender-affirming care can be challenging on the easiest of days, and we know this is an especially confusing time as many in-person services are now virtual. Join us for a live Q&amp;A session with a medical provider and staff from the Fenway Health Trans Health Program who will answer your questions about gender-affirming care.

**This month's topic will be chest binding.** Each month, we plan to talk about a different topic related to gender-affirming care. You can join us through Zoom and ask your questions directly. You can also submit your questions ahead of time to [transhealth@fenwayhealth.org](mailto:transhealth@fenwayhealth.org)   with the subject line, ""Trans Health  Q&amp;A"". We will record the   Q&amp;A sessions and post them on our website to access anytime.

**These sessions will take place every month on the 1st Wednesday of every month from noon‚Äì1 p.m.** EST. Stay tuned for future discussion topics. Please reach out to [transhealth@fenwayhealth.org](mailto:transhealth@fenwayhealth.org) with any questions or concerns.

Can't  make it to the live Q&amp;A? Although we hope to see you there, we will be recording the session and post it on our website for you to review.

This just happened today and my fingers are fidgeting because of the sheer anger i feel right now.

So basically I was playing some PvP game (not going to name anything along the story) i was talking to a person there i just met.. You know, basic chit chat.That was until some other player came over and went ""Calm down ladies""  insinuating that we were noisy though i don't think we were- and straight away killing both of us...(for context, i am biologically male and identify as gender neutral/nonbinary)

I shook off the assumption thinking nothing of it though it clearly ticked me off-

So i ironically went ""Hey there buckaroo, i'm gender neutral and you better respect that!"" heading his way.

This is where the toxicity started:

\-""What the f\*ck do you mean , there are only girls and boys that play this"" he said as he started to attack again.

\-""Hey, ngl that's pretty offensive you should stop-"" (after that they went to spawn-kill me when i was afk/typing on the chat, so i normally got mad at this pettiness)

I can't recall what i said but it was just some long tirade about how he's the lowest f\*cking transphobic and toxic player i've ever met on this community and that it's because of dry ass garbage human beings like them that society is so unaccepting of people like us in the LGBTQ+..

A bit later we stopped fighting and he decided to ""talk"" as he said.

I thought that we would wrap things up and just end it but turns out no, what he meant by ""talk"" was literally telling me to go ""rant about trans rights on reddit or something  because this game is not suited for your behavior""In a clear passive-agressive tone as if his hateful comments weren't against the rules in the first place, no sh\*t my guy.

This is like the first time i've ever experienced harrassment for being nonbinary and it hurts like crap tho what i experienced is nothing compared to actual physical harrassment against queer people.

Anyways that was it pretty much,i'm not writing this to send hate to anyone but rather to relieve my anger towards this situation.

Im seeing a lot of hate against people who identify as nonbinary/GNC/gender queer but still ""wear skirts and wear makeup"".

Why can't we? Or, what would you say to argue that we can?

I dont like she/her, but I like presenting physically more feminine. To me, its more about my internal traits, how I view myself, how society views women, and how society views me.

But I see people say that invalidates (don't know if im using the right word, bc im reading valid is bad word now) other nonbinary people.

Im genuinely just trying to understand what my label is ""suppose to be"". 

I feel myself saying I am not a woman, and I love wearing makeup and even a dress sometimes. 

Im new to this discussion, so plz don't be mean.

I finally told my world to use they/them pronouns and call me Rue instead of Chelsea, and it makes me so happy. Ive never felt more me. But I just joined the online discourse of these labels and im like wtf. Am I doing life wrong?

I've imagined this happening before and was cool with the idea (obviously since I'm on this subreddit), but it seems way more weird and difficult to just flip that switch in my head than I thought it would. I know this whole thing is more difficult for them, but I still feel like this.

Maybe it's just the sudden change I can't control when I'm already feeling weird and helpless from other things. And my baby sibling who I've known by a different name and pronouns all their life needing me to do things I can't be 100% sure I can do.

It hurts just to think that I'll probably mess up. I think it's just scary not knowing what the future might hold for them and not knowing if I'll be able to do help when I love them so much.

And also my own weird wibbly wobbly gender stuff feels like it's been stomped down on and idk why!

And idk if that means I should ditch them or if I'm just being mean to myself.

Basically I love my sibling and I'm proud of them, but I have problems of my own that are making me feel like shit.

Y‚Äôall are valid people and I have nothing but respect for you. Me on the other hand? Yeesh, I‚Äôm a mess.

Alright let‚Äôs start a few years back. So, at 16 years old I had an existential awakening that‚Äôs been tormenting me ever since and it all boils down to identity. I‚Äôm not just talking about gender identity yet. I‚Äôm talking about the essence of who I am. What makes me me? And over the years, I‚Äôve delved mostly into the mental side of things rather than the physical side of things. I pretty much came to the determination that this physical body is merely a shell that I use to traverse this planet. Everything that is truly me is in the mind and soul.

Anyways, I‚Äôm 24 now and this whole existential identity crisis hasn‚Äôt quite faded away yet. In fact, recently this whole ‚Äúphysical aspects of identity are inconsequential to who I am‚Äù thing has gotten stronger to the point that I‚Äôm beginning to question whether or not I fully subscribe to the gender written on my birth certificate. After all, the only thing that truly matters are my personal values, interests, etc. And with my recent confirmation to myself that I am bisexual, my feelings towards my own gender are increasingly blurred.

So, I‚Äôve begun to think I might be nonbinary, but there‚Äôs this thought that keeps popping up in my head that I‚Äôm really just considering the idea of being nonbinary to rebel against any sort of physical label I can. And if that‚Äôs the case, isn‚Äôt it kind of offensive for me to be adapting this identity simply out of my somewhat pretentious viewpoint on identity? I don‚Äôt want to say I‚Äôm something I‚Äôm not because if it‚Äôs not true, then I‚Äôd be being inauthentic (which is a surefire way to feed my depression).

A couple of final notes
1: I am highly considering transforming my general outfit and appearance to something more androgynous. It just seems right.
2: However, I have no intentions of making any purposeful major changes to my body shape to approach an equilibrium
3: One possible invisible force that could be causing extra doubt is the fact that pretty much everyone I know off the web is Christian. They‚Äôre fine people and all and I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd be extremely hateful or anything, but there would certainly be some pushback. I have also refused to reveal my bisexuality offline for the same reason though I am more confident on that end of things. However, since I‚Äôm purposefully restricting myself to the single life until I get my shit together, this is extremely easy to hide. I worry that nonbinary won‚Äôt have the same advantages.
4: I‚Äôm not sure how I feel about pronouns at the moment. I‚Äôm not really having any issues with my current pronoun situation with everyone understandably assuming I‚Äôm cis. But I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd have too much of an issue with any sort of pronoun directed towards me. They is a bit odd due to my mind being trained to view it as a plural pronoun for two decades, but then again I‚Äôve been having this odd sort of a semi-permanent Dichotomind phase (long story, kind of unrelated, and I won‚Äôt bog you down any further unless you want to hear about it in the comments) so I guess referring to me as a plural person wouldn‚Äôt be entirely inaccurate any more.

So yeah, I know it‚Äôs a common insult of sorts to just label nonbinary people as just confused, but damn am I confused. If you've got any advice or knowledge that can help me sort through this mess of a mind, I'd much appreciate it.

Gender has been a wild ride for me and I'm not sure that identifying as a woman does anything for me. I have a strong connection with womanhood from being socialized as a Black woman. But that's about it.

On bios, I write something like ""GNC girl"", which feels comfortable for me. The rationale behind this is multi-faceted: a) the linguistic productivity of the word ""girl"" usually leaves more room for ""tomboy"" antics and non-normative behaviors and b) while I can't confirm my own psychology I think part of my reasoning is that still identifying as cis to some extent saves me from constant discrimination and questioning, even though I feel no strong attachment to being a cis woman. 

In case any other background is helpful, sexuality-wise I'm queer/pan, my gender presentation is pretty masc and rotates between tomboy casual and stemme fuckboi. I'm a big fan of men's streetwear!

Has anyone here ever wavered between the categorical instances of identifying as nonbinary vs. gender nonconforming?

Does anyone or did anyone ID as a gender nonconforming cis person? And for the latter, what was the process of relinquishing the ""cis"" part of that identity and claiming a new identity, presumably nonbinary?

I know I am agender. I guess what's holding me back is figuring out what that means to me. Lately that has been changing to lean towards binding and trying to present more masc. To me, this feels like a better expression of my gender.

My issue is that I get hung up on this thought that I'm not nonbianary/trans enough because I dont have more dysphoria, especially when I see people saying you must have dysphoria to be trans. :( 

This worries me, because some days I definitely don't have dysphoria. I feel fine. And maybe what I feel that I've described doesn't even qualify as dysphoria in the first place in which case, I dont have dysphoria at all. 

But you know what I've concluded? Even with all of that, at the end of the day, I AM trans enough. Because I am agender. That's not going anywhere. I just happen to be in a very curvaceous afab body. Just because I dont hate it doesn't mean I'm not 100% agender.

I've recently been going through a career transition and in entering a new workplace, I've gotten many surveys asking for my pronouns (to better support folks) and I've been getting more and more uncomfortable and dysphoric with giving my pronouns. I honestly don't know what my gender is or what pronouns I feel comfortable with right now. I've been avoiding listing pronouns whenever I can, but I also work and exist on social media in queer-positive places and I don't want to seem ignorant or unsupportive by not listing any pronouns.


I am AFAB and always just used she/her but I've also never felt comfortable as female. Growing up and even now I don't feel comfortable in my body. I have a weird mix of tall, broad shoulders and generally muscular but also large bust and curvy. I've never felt feminine enough to fit into ""female"" or masculine enough to fit into ""male"". I was often described as a tomboy growing up. I often am male in my dreams, play male in D&amp;D or other avatar/fantasy situations, identify more with male fictional characters. But how much of that is that society has really screwed over women and I've been socialized to think being a male is better? This has really been weighing on me. Do I just identify as not-female/with masculine because I'm not conventionally female-pretty and society has told me being female is bad and male is good? How can I know? How do I break out of these thought patterns?


At the same time, I don't feel that I'm 100% male. I've also dabbled over time in dressing more femme, wearing makeup with some success and positive feelings. I feel overall I like to present more masculine in casual/business situations and more feminine in fancy/celebratory situations? But that's an oversimplification. In my head and to my closest people, I've described myself as nonbinary or genderqueer.


I also don't know how to take the next step. I have a partner who I talk about this with sometimes and he is 110% supportive of anything that would make me happy. My work community is fairly supportive but I do work in a very competitive career and generally have always put myself aside to be more successful. Addtionally my parents/ older family would never understand or accept me. I don't live with or depend on my parents, but they are getting older and it doesn't feel worth it to fight this battle with them. In general it has just felt easier to do nothing about my gender, but it's really starting to get at me. How I can I find and live my gender-truth? What do I do about my pronouns? 


TLDR: I feel uncomfortable as she/her, but not sure what my gender is. Societal sexism makes this confusing for me.

However, I am finding it difficult to remember to use the new (to me) name and pronoun consistently (it's been two days).\n\nSo any advice how to get used to the name/pronoun change?\nWere you upset when family slipped up?\n\nRecognizing we are all unique individuals, do you have any words of wisdom?\n\nI want to support and love them as I always have while ensuring they know that love and support has not changed.  (I have told them, but as a parent, you wonder how much your child believes you).\n\nThank you for taking the time to read and respond..... I think this is my first reddit post ever.  ü•≥"", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Guidance please', 'created': 1590641529.0}"

I m not native English speaker so please be patient.
I got some issues lately. Let me explain from the beginning. 

 I m 26 y.o male from very homophobic country. I had come out as biseksuel to my friends one year ago. By that time even I didn't understand I was nb. I thought I was bi. 

My fiancee broke with me because of my needs and even she knew I was in love with her she had gone to "" a real man"". Yes she said that. 
After that I got deep depression. I quit my job. I was smoking, snorting ,drinking all day. I didn't want to live with consciousness. 

 Luckily I met with my bi gf. We were did that same thing all day but we were together. I didn't tell her anything about my sexuality yet. When she told me I got a women side and she love whatever I m, I have been happy from that moment. I came out to her and told her I was not sure what were i. 

 With that open mind gf I had accepting myself day by day. And came out as nb. By that time we were living together in her flat. It was good days. After a couple months our economy had collapsed. We close our home and came to my parents house. It was not bad at first we could act like ""normal couple"" and actually it was good for our health to. 

 When that coranavirus came out my parents told us she had to go her hometown and she did gone. 
Now. She ask me for sleep with a guy. Even though we fantasized many time. We couldn't do threesome nor other people things. And specially after I ask for if one of us sleep with anybody, other one could sleep with that being to (we call that my Valentine's valentine is mine valentine:)) that guy is hetero.

I m really afraid. I don't want to be that jealous bitch. But I don't want to lose her to a ""real man"" either. And yeah I want to sleep with anybody soon. Doesn't matter which gender it is.

I am AFAB and have been with my cisgender hetero  partner for six years. I recently talked to him about my gender identity, and he was supportive but didn‚Äôt totally get it.

While it will not be for a while (because it‚Äôs a big decision and also money), I‚Äôve been increasingly interested in top surgery.

2020-05-28 23:17:37,gsh71z,5,1,"Tl;Dr I'm writing a fantasy-esque novel where there are 6 main characters and they are all close friends that follow a common goal towards overtaking an immortal (ish) evil that steals life from the living to enhance his lifespan. This story is loosely based on myself and my 5 best friends from middle school, but they all became characters I've loved and developed. 

One of my characters is a binary trans woman, but part of her storyline is that she is the ""prince"" that's expected to grow into being king. Her struggle/plot stems from wanting to fulfill her role as a king while also figuring out how to accept and treat her gender dysphoria and live the life she wants to lead as a woman. Her arc isn't about her transness as a problem, but rather how it plays into her desire to be the best royalty she can be. (She actually has a happy ending that satisfies both) but anyway, to give hints as to her being trans, she starts the book with he/him pronouns, throughout the middle uses singular they/them, and finally as she accepts it and has taken steps to transition uses she/her pronouns. 

This gets confusing when you add two of the other six into this equation. One of them is genderfluid, and uses they/them, but they always keep the same name. This person is assigned male at birth, and also sometimes uses he/him pronouns, and I've been writing this character with he/him pronouns out of habit. They dress very...questionably for a cis male in this universe (e.g. wears a kilt instead of pants). People don't necessarily object to ""crossdressing"" in this universe, but they wouldn't suspect him wearing a kilt to necessarily mean ""nonbinary"" either. I don't know how to code them as ""genderfluid"" because their story isn't about their transition or gender, but rather they play a more ""mentor"" role among the main 6. 

Finally, there's the one based on me. I've been using she/her pronouns because this character is a ""princess"" and is in line to be the next ""queen"" (king and queen have different roles in this universe), and doesn't like the idea of being queen and her entire goal is to be ""normal"" and basically be treated as herself first and not have the royalty label attached to her in the first place. This person is based directly off of myself,and later on develops a more androgynous style similar to mine. However, their gender also has little to nothing to do with their plot or essence as a character other than the gender role of princess playing a part. I don't want nonbinary to be the inheret 'problem' of their story, but rather I don't know how to think of this character as nonbinary because I feel like they should end up NB because I am. 

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially, I think it would be confusing in a character-driven story if 3 of the main 6 end up primarily using they/them singular as their pronouns. I don't know how to balance this. The main reason I don't adopt neopronouns is because nobody uses them or knows how to say them (including myself) and I'd rather not have my gender cause issues in my social life if I can avoid it.

I am biologically female and have had this experience for around 4-5 years, and before but I didn't know the names for it. Originally I thought I was a trans man, I had body, voice and social dysphoria ever since primary school (Aussie) but recently my feelings have changed. I have always preferred male pronouns, he/him/himself etc. I have always wanted male titles, I wanted to be a dad, father, husband etc. not a mother, not a wife, not a girlfriend. It sounds perfect, right? nope. Originally I hated female clothing, but recently I've realised something new. I want to be cute, I like feminine clothes and I want to twirl and dance. I like being called a male but I fear if I transition I'll be forced into toxic masculinity. I've never considered myself nonbinary. I have nothing against it, I just never thought it was possible.

2020-05-29 17:23:27,gsx5l6,2,2,"Hey all.   


I identify as trans nonbinary.  I am AFAB but do not jive with my body nor a lot of words, phrases, and expectations that a lot of people have for ""women.""  At this point, I just refer to myself JOKINGLY as a ""vagina owner.""  I am eventually going to be getting top surgery and have been doing research into micro-dosing testosterone, but I am not sure if that's for me.   


Anyway, I had an encounter online where a trans woman (I am only mentioning that she is trans for context.  To me, she is obviously a woman) bashed me for being nonbinary, accused me of ""gender lobbying"" when I was trying to explain to other users what being nonbinary might encompass.  Worst of all, she claimed that I was ""stealing"" the trans label because I'm not transitioning.    


Mind you, I have socially transitioned.  I don't use my birth name.  My pronouns are they/them.  If you ever see me, it is clear I'm not feminine in the slightest.  I shouldn't have been upset, but it rattled me.  How am I not transitioning when I plan to get top surgery?  Why? Because I don't want to take hormones?  There isn't one way to transition.   


The whole encounter felt incredibly invalidating, as my gender has been something I've been struggling for years.  I kept my virtual head held high, didn't stoop to her level (which was claiming that our community ""doesn't no how many genders we want"" and laughing at the fact that I am, in fact, going to be getting surgery in the future.  When I asked, ""how is that not transitioning?""  - all she did was laugh.  Thankfully, I kept cool.  I told her that not only does my life experience NOT invalidate hers, but that her laughing at me doesn't change that my experience is very real.

i have had a number of situations with this person that have ended very negatively, them making comments about my weight, making fun of my sexuality, etc...

i specifically asked my girlfriend not to discuss my gender with anyone, especially that person in particular, as i need to come out at my own pace and i wouldn't want them knowing anyway. i find out on the Tuesday just gone, however, that she outed me to this person. i ended up having a panic attack whilst my girlfriend complained at me that it was ""no big deal"" and that she was ""just helping because i was too big of a wuss to do it myself"".

2020-05-31 01:18:12,gtpzum,2,1,"I've been thinking about the very binary way we are taught to think about the world in dominant society... Straight vs gay, male vs female, platonic vs romantic, innocent vs guilty, healthy vs ill, neurotypical vs neurodivergent, religion vs science, humanities vs STEM, etc.

Obviously, I don't need to explain to r/NonBinary why that's harmful! Sometimes this binary way of seeing the world can help simplify things, but it very often oversimplifies and flattens out a lot of very real and valid complexities that are important to recognize as we navigate the world.

I think part of the self-actualization, self-regulation, and self-growth that I‚Äôm working on is intimately tied to that process of recognizing/accepting that most things in the world exist on a spectrum or are fluid in nature‚Ä¶ To un-learn the binary way that we all have been socialized to view the world in.

Gender non-conforming folks live that truth every day, for example, through the pronouns they use.

So‚Ä¶ Essentially, I‚Äôm wondering whether I ought to start identifying as ‚Äúshe/her or they/them‚Äù or ‚Äúusually she/her but any pronouns are fine‚Äù as one way of embracing that fluidity. But if I do that, would I be unintentionally ‚Äúappropriating‚Äù they/them pronouns as a cis person? Because, while I have struggled a lot with ‚Äúfiguring out‚Äù my sexuality, I‚Äôve had an easy time with my gender. I‚Äôm AFAB and I feel comfortable identifying as a woman.

Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but I think many (most?) people who use they/them pronouns do so because they feel that their gender doesn‚Äôt fit the typical two-gender paradigm we‚Äôre taught. I‚Äôve never felt that way (although I have definitely felt resentment towards gender norms, particularly the social pressure to shave/wax as a woman). I would be using they/them as a way of recognizing the shortcomings of the binary paradigm in general. So I guess instead of gender non-conforming, I‚Äôd be binary non-conforming.

What do you think of all this? Do you think these are solid reasons to start using other pronouns along with my birth pronouns, or am I right to be worried about appropriating non-binary pronouns?

2020-05-31 14:52:08,gu0fsw,8,2,"Hi, everyone! I‚Äôm Hollis. I‚Äôm AFAB and 23 years old.

I know that I‚Äôve been nonbinary for about three years now, and I‚Äôm just kicking around ideas of what testosterone therapy (TT) could do to make my body and overall appearance more androgynous.

I currently have no strong intentions or desires to start testosterone therapy if I don‚Äôt need it.

I‚Äôve read that **irreversible** changes from TT are:
- Potential male-pattern hair loss
- Deeper voice
- Increased body and facial hair
- Increased genital growth

And I‚Äôve read that the **reversible** changes from TT are:
- Body fat redistribution
- Coarser, oilier, and thicker skin
- Acne
- Increased body odor
- Increased sweating

I‚Äôm not exactly sure what I would look like with facial hair, or if I would like it at all, but a more androgynous face and body would be appealing to me.

Yet, not so masculine that it would prevent me from presenting as female at times if I wanted to. I‚Äôm really looking for that middle space between female and male, if it‚Äôs even possible to achieve.

While the possibility for hair loss doesn‚Äôt sound great, what makes me more uneasy is the result of genital growth. I‚Äôm okay with having a clitoris and vagina; that has never bothered me.

However, I don‚Äôt like the idea of having a penis. I know that the clitoris is analogous to the penis, but how much does the clitoris grow on testosterone?

Is it noticeable? Is it uncomfortable? Could I still have vaginal sex?

I haven‚Äôt been able to find any comparison pictures between pre-T and post-T growth, so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking.

What are the dose strength differences between microdose, low-dose, and full-dose testosterone? Is there even a difference between a microdose and a low dose?

I also have cerebral palsy and don‚Äôt have complete use of my left hand, so I don‚Äôt think that I would be able to give myself injections. A gel or cream that I could apply to my stomach or legs would work best, or I could use a transdermal patch.

For those of you who have had microdose/low-dose testosterone therapy, what was your dose strength, medication type, and what did your timeline of changes look like? Could achieving a middle-ground appearance be possible?

All of this is hypothetical for me right now, and potential reference material if I do want to explore testosterone therapy in the future.
