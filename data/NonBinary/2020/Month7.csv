2020-07-01 00:57:39,hj09fc,6,1,"Hi all, I've been lurking for a long time but never posted before!! I was hoping for some advice... Some info about me -- I'm 19 AFAB, and I've been on low-dose T (as in, one pump of gel 2-3x a week) for about 10 months. Prior to that, I was on some blocker that wound up making me low in both E and T. I've always had really thick, strong hair.

I started noticing that hairs were thinner almost immediately after starting T (not sure if that was due to the blocker or not). I lost a lot of hair 4-5 months after starting it, but you couldn't see any difference in my scalp. My hair loss rate since then has ebbed and flowed, with seemingly no pattern. In the beginning of May, I started to notice rapid hair thinning at my temples and less severely at my crown. My hair also feels a lot more brittle now, and I'm almost scared to touch it for fear of losing more. Hair loss was once of my big cons for T, but I figured I'd cross that bridge when I got to it... here I am :(

 I know finasteride is a thing but I've heard there are some potentially dysphoria-inducing side effects like menstrual cycles restarting. I was wondering if anyone's had similar experiences and has any advice?? 

 I feel way too young to be losing my hair, and it's emotionally devastating for me because, for a really long time, my hair was the only part of myself that I liked. I have a video appt with a dermatologist later this week to see if there's something else going on, but my endocrinologist hasn't given me any advice other than finasteride or lowering my T dose (which I don't think is realistic because I was constantly exhausted and had dissociative feelings that interfered with my ability to function before T).

I should mention that my gender dysphoria has caused an eating disorder (from the age of 15 onwards) which I’m trying to recover from but just the thought of my breasts growing is terrifying enough to rather want to deal with the consquences of malnutrition and being slightly Underweight 🤦🏼‍♀️

2020-07-01 14:48:20,hjbmqf,2,2,"Throughout my life, I've spent a lot of time questioning my gender. I was born in a female body, and most of the time I feel pretty comfortable in it. But sometimes I don't. Sometimes I feel like I'm not female. I don't necessarily feel male during these times, maybe somewhere in the realm of nonbinary. 

When I was in high school, a few things in my life coincided. I realized I didn't always feel comfortable as a girl, I realized I could shorten my name to Shaun instead of the more feminine nickname I usually go by, and my brother had a growth spurt and outgrew most of his clothes. This led to me spending about a year wearing my brother's clothes, going by Shaun. I definitely didn't pass as male, I was going for a more androgynous look. My family was fine with this and was very supportive. 

I ended up going back to my feminine name and started wearing my own clothes again after a while, and to this day I can't adequately explain why I did. I guess I became more comfortable in my feminine side, and no longer felt the need to outwardly express any not-female gender experience I had. I haven't felt not-female in a few years. 

All that being said, this past month or so, I've started feeling not-female again. Not male, but something... else. I don't know how to explain it. I don't think I'm going to do anything about it outwardly. I love wearing feminine clothes now, and I'm not going to change my style or anything.

I was born in a female body, and most of the time I feel pretty comfortable in it. But sometimes I don't. Sometimes I feel like I'm not female. I don't necessarily feel male during these times, maybe somewhere in the realm of nonbinary. \n\nWhen I was in high school, a few things in my life coincided. I realized I didn't always feel comfortable as a girl, I realized I could shorten my name to Shaun instead of the more feminine nickname I usually go by, and my brother had a growth spurt and outgrew most of his clothes. This led to me spending about a year wearing my brother's clothes, going by Shaun. I definitely didn't pass as male, I was going for a more androgynous look. My family was fine with this and was very supportive. \n\nI ended up going back to my feminine name and started wearing my own clothes again after a while, and to this day I can't adequately explain why I did. I guess I became more comfortable in my feminine side, and no longer felt the need to outwardly express any not-female gender experience I had.

2020-07-02 02:18:39,hjohv4,9,1,"Hello! I've been questioning my gender recently and wanted to know your thoughts on whether I'm possibly a non-binary/demigirl/genderfluid person. General facts about me are that I'm AFAB and currently 18. Possible TW for anything that can trigger gender dysphoria.

In my childhood, I never experienced any dysphoria about my body or presenting as female. I wasn't the most feminine in my friend group but regardless I never felt anything inherently ""wrong"" about myself. When I was 13, I heard of the term non-binary and questioned my gender - in the end being comfortable with identifying as cis at the time. Through high school I discovered more about myself in other ways (including being bi, having depression/anxiety) but I didn't second guess my gender until this year.

What changed was cutting my hair really short at the beginning of March. Before, I was eager to be feminine in public but I felt very euphoric after presenting more ""masculine"". Some of my friends started calling me ""butch"" for changing my style, however, I wasn't comfortable with that word to describe me. I began to realize my ""aspired femininity"" wasn't actually what I wanted to present as, it was more what I was attracted to in other feminine people. That being said, I don't want to completely erase my connection to femininity and being a ""woman"" since I lived my whole life presenting as one. I am aware that fashion has to do with gender expression which isn't the same as gender identity so this is why I think I might just be a gender non-conforming person.

The thing is, during these last couple of weeks, I started to develop a slight discomfort with my top half. I'm feeling kind of confined to be a just a girl because of my chest (which at first I didn't have a problem with). I don't feel the need to get any top surgery or medically alter anything about myself, but I would like to experiment with potentially getting a chest binder. I currently cannot do anything about that since I am living with my immigrant Polish-conservative parents until quarantine is over so how I feel wearing one is TBD. I feel indifferent about my bottom half, not anything to note of.

Other things to note: I don't feel compelled to change my name. My full name is Gabriela, nickname is Gabi which are both pretty feminine (Gabi being preferred). Also being 18, I feel that I should have thought about this sooner. Many trans/nb people are certain at a younger age (whether they are aware of the terms or not) whether something is up. Lastly there is a lot of stigma (unfortunately) of AFAB people identifying as non-binary while being comfortable with being feminine at times. I want to make this clear that I am not questioning my gender because ""I'm not like other girls"" or that I want to separate myself from misogyny. I am genuinely wondering whether there is another side of myself that I have suppressed for my own comfort.

I think after reflecting on it on my own, I might want to identify as a demigender person using she/her and/or they/them pronouns. I haven't experimented with pronouns yet since I am not sure whether I am mistaken in wanting to identify with this. I don't want my friends/family to judge me before I am sure of who I am which is why I am asking for your opinion.

Thank you for taking the time to read this! Any advice/comments/questions would be very appreciated. :))

TL;DR - I am a 18 y/o AFAB who is questioning whether I am nb/demigender for the first time in my life. For most of my life I felt no dysphoria/was comfortable with being feminine. I got a short-short haircut back in March this year that made me reflect on my gender expression (changing from wanting to present feminine all the time to both masculine and feminine at times) and gender identity (being slightly uncomfortable with my chest for past couple of weeks). I don't feel the need to medically alter myself or change my name and, being aware of the nb umbrella for many years, I think I should have questioned myself much earlier.

I was born male and currently identify as male. I'm sex repulsed and touch repulsed because of the AroAce. I don't mind seeing women naked (but it doesn't do anything for me) however seeing male nudity repulses me.

I've never been particularly masculine and have often been called gay as I can be feminine. At least feminine for a guy I guess. I've never been so feminine that I felt female.

I've never once questioned my gender though until tonight when someone assumed I was NonBinary because I was AroAce.

So I've spent a lot of time tonight researching NB and Agender, seeing how it fits with AroAce's and if we can be or can't be NB/A but I've not found an answer either way.

Mainly after reading up I'm wondering if because I can be masculine and feminine am I potentially Bigender?

When I found the term AroAce I openly cried as suddenly EVERYTHING made sense upon reading up on it. 

Reading up on all of this I'm genuinely confused how it's defined and how people know they're NB or Agender or anything in-between. So my base assumption would be I'm CisMale and letting someone's innocent assumption get in my head.

Let's start with the one piece of information I was given and know to be true: I HAVE MALE GENITALIA. I'm 20. I'm currently running with Nonbinary+Trigender+Straightw/womenSapiosexualw/men. Whichever serves me well internally/conversationally I suppose when trying to describe where I'm at on one of these topics. I'm still overcoming my own programming as you can probably tell with that clearly dense set of labels but with the research I've done so far, it's all I've got. I question whether this is from lack of exploration or if I truly prefer a more complex set of labels because each topic demands its own term.

So I stumbled into a gender identity/sexual identity crisis (on L by myself admittedly) at one point during a recent relationship that has now recently ended. 1: I was questioning the role love serves in my life (it seems like the fabric of the universe, causality, family, adoration/romance and attraction for me to sum it up: nonexclusive because every person in my life serves such an important role), 2: the things maleness are attributed to in this world/associated with in my head (tragedy and sexual misconduct/""BDE"" I see around me that I get extremely uncomfortable with), 3: then also I was questioning attraction I've felt to a couple of specific male individuals that isn't exactly sexual in nature but the companionship factor and emotions are different than what I experience with females, 4: I've always been on the empathetic/emotional side (which sometimes feels a bit foreign to my masculine tendencies/pressure around me) some say its my astrology, some say its my numerology, others say I have the duality of masculine and feminine at play within myself but it's hard not to feel complex especially with the vast amount of information out there.

I recognize that there are so many societal, social, economic, etc. factors at play that put me in a position to have these kinds of questions. I also have noticed and observed balancing forces of masculine, feminine, and feeling of nongender at alternating but distinct play. I feel like a lot of this is driven by my current emotional state and questioning overall of the world around me and whatever role or sense of purpose I feel at play here. I'm a being. I get along really well with and have non-sexual relationships with a solid percentage of females in my life and I have a strong sense of companionship when it comes to men.

I don't necessarily want a label here but it also has been a solace of sorts reading other stories and seeing that nobody is alone in ANY of these realms of questioning.

But its also only been a few weeks so maybe i just need more time?

I can never tell, so i was hoping to come here for some advice from people who know what theyre talking about lol.

Im amab and most of my life ive been pretty comfortable with that, but ive never been able to satisfy the male stereotype in my head, and ive always repressed and hated that i sometimes want to wear cute femme clothes and makeup, up until a few months ago.

So now im just not sure where i stand, i dont mind male pronouns and when i tested out neutral pronouns i kinda just didnt feel much of a difference, but feminine pronouns dont really sit right.

Also, i felt fucking amazing for a few days when i kinda came out to myself that i could be nonbinary, i dont know how to explain it but i just felt lighter and brighter, but now im just overthinking and i cant decide where i stand or if im just telling myself these things or subconciously doing it for attention somehow or just making it up to be different or something. 
How can i tell if im nonbinary or something else or if im just male and this is a phase. 
How can i truly test it when i have to remind myself in my head because i kinda default to a masculine mindset when it feels that theres nothing changed outwardly, so i dont stay in like a femme or enby sort of headspace for very long, if that makes sense. 
Is that genderfluid? I dont know, i dont know enough about this so i cant really classify for sure how i feel, maybe im just a basic guy who likes to crossdress or something, im just unsure.

2020-07-03 01:17:20,hk9tup,4,1,"Hey, i’m 20. almost 21, afab trans-masculine non-binary. i’ve never really been super feminine throughout my whole life, i refused to wear dresses as a little kid &amp; the “femme” look just never quite fit me. i first //seriously// questioned my gender when i was in high school. that was almost immediately shut down bc my girlfriend, at the time, told me she didn’t know if she’d be with me still bc she’s a woman who prides herself on liking women. 
the wording of that still trips me up, but anyways it just kinda became an afterthought. at the time i was super butch &amp; weighed over 300 lbs. i went through a major weight loss of 120 lbs and then through a whole self rediscovery period where i realized “oh hey i’m kinda comfy expressing my femininity” so i tried that for a bit, and it was nice. it was a part of me but not the closest i could be to truly being me. i dated a trans guy, and i did love him very much. but i also realized after the fact that i was vicariously living through him in a way. i didn’t know it at the time, but that definitely helped me accept my own identity.

last night i thought i finally figured out i was non binary and came out to some people telling them to use they/them pronouns and call me Noa but immediately started to think i did the wrong thing and un-came out. i feel like the reasons i was second guessing myself last night was i thought it was too late and i was stuck as non binary forever and what if i really wasn’t and that freaked me out. and it’s little things i stress about after that. i don’t picture myself as being a girl right now but if i think about the future when i’m like 40 years old or old i can’t picture myself being non binary. maybe it’s because there’s not a lot of older non binary representation but i watched that video that that youtuber ash made with non binary people ages 30-70 and honestly it made me feel better. another thing is i know i want to have kids but everything online says the gender neutral term for parent is something like ren or dommy or mapa and i’m not really a fan(although saw one called zizi but that sounds like an aunt kinda term to me) but i have heard of non binary people that still use the binary terms. another thing is i don’t think i’m gonna be able to come out again to the people i already un-came out to. i think i need a lot more time before i would do it again. i felt so bad because the majority of people i already came out to were trans or non binary(because i knew they’d definitely accept me) and i’m scared it made them think less of me. and if i come out again they’ll think even less of me. and like i said that i kinda felt uncomfortable now that people were using they/them pronouns and calling me noa so i was just gonna go back to sarah and she/her pronouns. and that was probably just because i wasn’t used to it. 

i definitely hate being referred to as she/her and god knows i hate he/him and i fucking love they/them(and i know you don’t have to be non binary to use they/them pronouns and i know you don’t have to use they/them pronouns to be non binary) i think it was the name that made me feel weird but i definitely like the name and i think it suits me it’s just weird.

also i’m scared that if i am non binary what if i come out to people and they don’t accept me. everyone i know i know accepts lgbt people but what about the +? i have a good friend who doesn’t think non binary people exist. i don’t think she’s a bad person i just think she doesn’t understand it and i don’t wanna lose her just because i’m not the gender she thought i was.

also another thing is idk how it works with school stuff do i like have to email someone beforehand to say “hey your chart says this but please refer to me as this” what if there’s teachers that refuse to do that?

and i know there are people that i CANNOT come out to at all. which kinda hurts because i’m around them often and i’ll have to tell people to refer to me differently around them.

also there’s things that i think may make it seem like i’m faking. like i wanna use a binder and have a flat chest but i’m not sure if i wanna get top surgery and even if i did get top surgery i don’t think i’d ever be comfortable with my chest just out.

As I'm uneducated on the subject, I can't be sure that I wouldn't unintentionally make someone uncomfortable by what I say and would like to avoid that.

I've read some articles saying that non-binary is an umbrella term, and you might identify as a gender in this spectrum if you feel like your not just a man or a woman. Now, if gender is a social construct, and therefore, doesn't exist, then how do you know you're nonbinary? Is it a feeling you can't describe, but just know deep down? Or is it because you might like make up and dresses one day and sports the next depending on your specific gender?

I got breast implants to reverse my top surgery and was totally confident in that decision as breast forms just didn't feel right and I was terrified of them shifting out of place or falling out. But, now I'm beginning to regret that decision because 1) my tits feel and look fake and now I have scars (I got keyhole top surgery before so had to have double incision for implants due to all the scar tissue around the nipples) and 2) sometimes I want to be totally flat-chested and miss my old chest. 

So, I've gone ahead and ordered a binder. I don't know if it's safe with implants. Is it? I'm not sure if I care.

Not in a way where I was totally uncomfortable in my girlhood/womanhood but enough to make me wonder ...'am I really one?' I'd go through phases of I guess presenting myself different. My clothing would completely change, my boobs would ruin the androgyny but I'd be happy and my family really is fine with it as long as I'm happy. And then I'd be right back to dressing in what one would assign to 'girl/woman' and happily flit back and forth depending on how I felt on the inside. My sister came out as aroace and agender and something about agender piqued my interest. That's how I would feel when I flit back and forth but I wouldn't say I completely agender so I never used the label. But this past June I saw someone share that they were a demigirl and I hadn't heard that term before. Being curious ole me, I looked it up and it was as if a light had shined down from the heavens above. That was it! That was me!

My clothing would completely change, my boobs would ruin the androgyny but I'd be happy and my family really is fine with it as long as I'm happy. And then I'd be right back to dressing in what one would assign to 'girl/woman' and happily flit back and forth depending on how I felt on the inside. My sister came out as aroace and agender and something about agender piqued my interest. That's how I would feel when I flit back and forth but I wouldn't say I completely agender so I never used the label.

Let's start with the one piece of information I was given and know to be true: I have an X and Y chromosome. I'm 20. I'm currently running with Nonbinary+Trigender+Straightw/womenSapiow/men. Whichever serves me well internally/conversationally I suppose when trying to describe where I'm at on one of these topics. I'm still overcoming my own programming as you can probably tell with that clearly dense set of labels but with the research I've done so far, it's all I've got. I question whether this is from lack of exploration or if I truly prefer a more complex set of labels because each topic demands its own term.

So I stumbled into a gender identity/sexualidentity crisis (on L by myself admittedly) at one point during a recent relationship that has now recently ended. 1: I was questioning the role love serves in my life (it seems like the fabric of the universe, causality, family, adoration/romance and attraction for me to sum it up: nonexclusive because every person in my life serves such an important role), 2: the things maleness are attributed to in this world/associated with in my head (tragedy and misconduct/""BDE"" I see around me that I get extremely uncomfortable with), 3: then also I was questioning attraction I've felt to a couple of specific male individuals that isn't exactly sexual in nature but the companionship factor and emotions are different than what I experience with females, 4: I've always been on the empathetic/emotional side (which sometimes feels a bit foreign to my masculine tendencies/pressure around me) some say its my astrology, some say its my numerology, others say I have the duality of masculine and feminine at play within myself but it's hard not to feel complex especially with the vast amount of information out there.

I recognize that there are so many societal, social, economic, etc. factors at play that put me in a position to have these kinds of questions. I also have noticed and observed balancing forces of masculine, feminine, and feeling of nongender at alternating but distinct play. I feel like a lot of this is driven by my current emotional state and questioning overall of the world around me and whatever role or sense of purpose I feel at play here. I'm a being. I get along really well with and have non-sexual relationships with a solid percentage of females in my life and I have a strong sense of companionship when it comes to men.

I don't necessarily want a label here but it also has been a solace of sorts reading other stories and seeing that nobody is alone in ANY of these realms of questioning.

part of me thinks this will just go away if i get a breast reduction. cause there are aspects of being a woman that i love. but i especially because i don’t want to co-opt a whole group of people’s identity if it’s just cause of my tits, ya know? or like because of the sexism that comes with having them lol

another part of me is thinking that this has been in the back of my head all along. and that maybe my reluctance to explore it just comes from fear of how people will react. like i know my parents will not take it well.. and it would always hurt my feeling SO bad when they wouldn’t let me dress how i wanted when i was little. so maybe it’s just a combination of a different gender expression  and body dysmorphia idk....

2020-07-04 20:42:26,hlabam,25,2,"hey y’all! 

i am new to this sub, and i’ve only been out as non-binary for about a month, so bear with me. i have some thoughts on my mind about my gender and sexual orientation, and i’d love to get some feedback/support. i’m hoping this is the right community for me, i was disappointed in some other supposedly inclusive subs.

let’s start with this: i have known i was a lesbian for pretty much my whole life. i’ve always been attracted to womxn. my first kiss was with a girl. however, i was raised in a very conservative family, so the compulsion to be heterosexual was really strong. i had a lot of really bad sexual encounters with men until i went to therapy to deal with it all. i finally came out as a lesbian because i fell in love with my best friend. (it didn’t end well but that’s another thread for another time.)

i’ve also never quite felt comfortable with my assigned gender. i felt more than just “oh i’m a tomboy, i don’t like pink things etc.” it was more of a “why do i have to be a woman. i did not sign up for this shit.” i hated being a girl, i hated my girly name, i hated my uterus and the things it did/does, i hated my figure. and then there was the dysphoria. i also knew i didn’t want to be a man. my feelings towards men are very complicated, but i know i’m not one. 

i didn’t learn about non-binary people until i was 15. i immediately felt a connection to the idea. finally someone said it, i wasn’t a man and i wasn’t a woman.  i don’t feel like i have any gender at all. i have no connection to the idea of being a man or a woman. when i was 16 i asked a few of my close, queer friends to start using they/them pronouns. when i went away to college i asked the people around me to use they/them pronouns. unfortunately after my first year i had to move back home for a time and i went back into the closet.

over a year later now i am finally out for good. my girlfriend and friends have been so supportive it’s been amazing. everyone is using my new name and the right pronouns. my parents are trying really hard too, i’m so proud of them. 

my dilemma now: just because i’m non-binary doesn’t mean i’m not a lesbian. i may not be a woman, but i still feel like i am a lesbian because of my social experience. society at large still perceives me as a woman, i was socialized growing up as a woman was. even though i don’t want to, i have still experienced aspects of womanhood. gender is a spectrum, and i know i am on the “not men” end of the spectrum. i guess i feel like i’m fem of center. just barely. i’m also into other “not men” people who identify as lesbians. this includes womxn and other non-binary people who call themselves lesbians. 

i don’t think lesbianism is exclusive to binary women. there is a long history in lesbian culture of he/him lesbians, butch lesbians, genderqueer lesbians, etc. i don’t see why it would be contradictory for me, a non-binary person, to call myself a lesbian. lesbians have always has a complicated relationship with gender. if i feel like a lesbian, if i identify with the lesbian experience, and i feel empowered by calling myself a lesbian, then why shouldn’t i?",NonBinary,being a non-binary lesbian,1593920546.0,"{'created_utc': 1593895346, 'id': 'hlabam', 'num_comments': 25, 'score': 2, 'selftext': 'hey y’all! \n\ni am new to this sub, and i’ve only been out as non-binary for about a month, so bear with me. i have some thoughts on my mind about my gender and sexual orientation, and i’d love to get some feedback/support. i’m hoping this is the right community for me, i was disappointed in some other supposedly inclusive subs.\n\nlet’s start with this: i have known i was a lesbian for pretty much my whole life. i’ve always been attracted to womxn. my first kiss was with a girl. however, i was raised in a very conservative family, so the compulsion to be heterosexual was really strong. i had a lot of really bad sexual encounters with men until i went to therapy to deal with it all. i finally came out as a lesbian because i fell in love with my best friend. (it didn’t end well but that’s another thread for another time.)\n\ni’ve also never quite felt comfortable with my assigned gender. i felt more than just “oh i’m a tomboy, i don’t like pink things etc.” it was more of a “why do i have to be a woman. i did not sign up for this shit.” i hated being a girl, i hated my girly name, i hated my uterus and the things it did/does, i hated my figure. and then there was the dysphoria. i also knew i didn’t want to be a man. my feelings towards men are very complicated, but i know i’m not one. \n\ni didn’t learn about non-binary people until i was 15. i immediately felt a connection to the idea. finally someone said it, i wasn’t a man and i wasn’t a woman.  i don’t feel like i have any gender at all. i have no connection to the idea of being a man or a woman. when i was 16 i asked a few of my close, queer friends to start using they/them pronouns. when i went away to college i asked the people around me to use they/them pronouns. unfortunately after my first year i had to move back home for a time and i went back into the closet.\n\nover a year later now i am finally out for good. my girlfriend and friends have been so supportive it’s been amazing. everyone is using my new name and the right pronouns. my parents are trying really hard too, i’m so proud of them. \n\nmy dilemma now: just because i’m non-binary doesn’t mean i’m not a lesbian. i may not be a woman, but i still feel like i am a lesbian because of my social experience. society at large still perceives me as a woman, i was socialized growing up as a woman was. even though i don’t want to, i have still experienced aspects of womanhood. gender is a spectrum, and i know i am on the “not men” end of the spectrum. i guess i feel like i’m fem of center. just barely. i’m also into other “not men” people who identify as lesbians. this includes womxn and other non-binary people who call themselves lesbians. \n\ni don’t think lesbianism is exclusive to binary women. there is a long history in lesbian culture of he/him lesbians, butch lesbians, genderqueer lesbians, etc. i don’t see why it would be contradictory for me, a non-binary person, to call myself a lesbian. lesbians have always has a complicated relationship with gender. if i feel like a lesbian, if i identify with the lesbian experience, and i feel empowered by calling myself a lesbian, then why shouldn’t i?', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'being a non-binary lesbian', 'created': 1593920546.0}"

I’ve always been able to dress quite neutral, and although I’m pretty tiny, I don’t have a super feminine body shape or anything so any kind of dysphoria has been very minimal.

I write this letter because I don’t want to tell you directly, 

I want to live outside the gender binary.
You will probably call it a phase or that I have it from a friend or something, but no, here is why i am genderless;

When you are young, you don’t really care about gender and stuff

When I became older, I started to realise that I wasn’t a girl, but I didn’t want to pull conclusions just yet

When around freshman year of high school, I started to realise that I really wasn’t a girl and really wasn’t a boy, eventually, I did research and found the naming of non-binary, or Enby, you always called it a phase and that I just was a less girly girl, and pulled to yourself, please, don’t do it, imagine someone saying those things to you, like you can’t have a own opinion, 

So please, accept me and my choices 

Love
Your genderless middle kid

Since I was 19 (I’m 26 now) I’ve been comfortable with how “androgynous” I look and even though I haven’t formally been using they/them pronouns people assume I do so they use them for me anyway. I feel like I already live my life as a non-binary person....but I just don’t want to come out. 

When I was 15 I had my first relationship and it was with a girl (I’m AFAB) but I never had like, the traditional coming out story people usually have. I just had a girlfriend one day. And even then I was way more middle of the road with my gender presentation. My sexuality was never a big deal so I don’t see why my gender has to be. 

I’ve officially started using they/them pronouns professionally (because of email signatures or if I list my pronouns in a bio) but that means that there are some people who still refer to me with my old pronouns...and honestly it doesn’t bother me. It doesn’t hurt my feelings and it doesn’t change who I am now, if I ever see them in person sure, I’ll totally tell them, but if me telling them now means writing a Facebook post or messaging them individually then forget it. 

I know for other people coming out is a huge part (and maybe even a necessary part) of their process but it just isn’t for me. My brother is Trans and we had a party for him when he changed his name, and he call the family to let them know he was starting his transition .

2020-07-06 00:02:10,hlx5dn,13,5,"*Hey beautiful people :)*

So, I identify as Non-Binary **(AFAB)** and I am looking to potentially start hormone therapy.

I was hoping to hear from some of you who are already **Micro-dosing Testosterone.** As far as I am aware, therapists/doctors will work to prescribe **Micro-doses** to **NB** patients who desire to experience physical changes at a slow pace or alternatively, stopping **T** when desirable characteristics are experienced.

I have been reading articles on **NB Medically Transitioning** on some reputable websites. There are some interviews/YouTube videos online of people who are **Micro-dosing T**, but there isn't too much out there. I'm unsure of how much research has been done though, especially in Australia.

I intend on seeing with a therapist who is knowledgeable in this field to discuss my potential options. *If approved,* I would be working with doctors and monitoring how my body synthesises **T** and how it interacts with my body chemistry. However, I would also like to talk to people who have first hand experiences if I can too :)

* **How long have you been micro dosing?**

&amp;#x200B;

* **What are the effects or changes you have experienced so far?**

&amp;#x200B;

* **How small is your dose, or has the dose been modified over time?**

*Thanks all!*

What your daily life is like. What role your gender plays in your life if any at all. What your response is to someone who accidentally misgenders you.

I don't intend to reveal this character's assigned gender because IMHO I don't think it really matters or advance the plot or character development. Opinions?

I also want to stay away from cliches and misconceptions. Do any of you have any cliches and misconceptions that you think I should stay away from?

2020-07-06 02:43:52,hlzisn,2,10,"For a bit more than a year, I identified as a nonbinary trans woman, and left it at that. I cared more about presentation than identity, so my focus was more on looking the part than *being a woman* on some deep ontological level. A few weeks ago, during an unrelated journey of self-discovery, I realized that I'm more-or-less agender. Just an agender person who vastly prefers presenting fem.

And then I was chatting with a friend who is often too brutally honest, and it suddenly occurred to me I should ask what she thinks of how I look without makeup. I sent her a few pix, including a few with deliberately bad angles, and she said that the only one where I was even slightly clockable was the one where I most went out of my way to look horrible. And just like that, I realized I had met one of my two main transition goals. The other one, having my body and brain work in a more feminine way, I had already met before. 

I finally started ""seeing her"" (i.e. seeing myself as a woman) in the mirror and... I think that broke me? I'm not entirely sure of that, but I know I hit a depressive spiral very soon after, and there are some other things in my life that definitely contributed, but all I know is that when I focused to try to get out of that spiral, one of the first things that came to mind was my gender. The fact that I finally saw ""her"" but that me being a ""her"" felt wrong. Not nearly as wrong as being a ""him,"" not by a long shot. But it felt wrong.

I asked my closest friends and my partner to switch to they/them and mostly neuter gendered terms for me. COVID makes hearing third-person references to myself a less frequent thing, so we'll see how that goes. But I just... am scared. Maybe pronouns are a dumb thing to be scared of. I'm lucky enough to live in a community where people generally get what they/them pronouns are and stuff. But I just can't shake this feeling that if this *is* the way I want to go, I'm giving up. Which, again, is dumb, because I know I like presenting fem, and looooove running on estrogen and progesterone instead of testosterone, and I never fully identified as a woman to begin with... but I don't know.

I am a PhD researcher in the School of Applied Psychology, University College Cork, and I am conducting a study on the barriers to engaging and communicating with healthcare professionals and services. This research is aimed at identifying the barriers to engaging with health care services in Ireland in order to improve access to healthcare for trans and/or non-binary people.

Participation in the research involves taking part in an interview.  This interview will be conducted online through the use of Microsoft Teams. If you choose to participate in an interview, you will be sent a link that provides access to the interview. You do not need to set up a Microsoft Teams account to participate. This interview will be audio-recorded and is expected to take 30-60 minutes to complete. Recordings will be deleted immediately after they are transcribed verbatim and any potentially identifying information will be redacted from the transcript.

We do not anticipate any negative outcomes from participating in this study. However, as some of the questions asked of you are of a personal nature relating to your experiences as a transgender and/or non-binary person, it may be possible that engaging in these topics could cause distress. Should you wish to do so, you may choose not to answer any questions or bring the interview to an end at any time.  

The information that is provided by participants will help to gain an understanding of the barriers to healthcare for transgender and non-binary people in Ireland, and will also be used to form part of a report to healthcare professionals. 

This research is being conducted by Siobhan Thomas, PhD researcher in the School of Applied Psychology, University College Cork. You can contact me for more information at [siobhan.thomas@ucc.ie](mailto:siobhan.thomas@ucc.ie)

2020-07-06 17:02:38,hmbhg0,8,3,"TLDR: Is it normal for a cis man to want to be/look more feminine? WHY do I want to be more feminine anyway?

I'm not sure what's going on with me. I'm AMAB, I don't have dysphoria when it comes to feeling like I was born the wrong sex or have the wrong genitals, I don't fantasize about having a vagina or breasts, or being called by female pronouns, I just hate my body, especially my body hair, and wish I had a more feminine figure. I'm a large hairy man, I'm trying to lose weight but I don't want to get big or gain muscle, I just want to be thin. I have a feeling once I get to my ideal weight and shave everything off I'll still be disappointed by how ""mannish"" I look.  If there was a button that could turn me into an androgynous twink I would press it in a heartbeat. If it were possible to microdose or be selective about the effects of HRT (the way it shapes your body/face and changes your skin) I would use it. I'm jealous of both beautiful women and beautiful men.

I also wish I had the confidence to be more gender non conforming in the way I dress, I don't want to stand out or look ridiculous. It worries me how often I'll see an article of clothing I like and realize it's ""for women""

I've googled my heart out but it I only ever find these desires discussed in the context of people who are trans, most guys it seems have no problem with their body hair and if they do have body issues it's wanting to be or be seen as muscular and more masculine, no one wants to be a twink and if they want to be more feminine it must be because they are trans. It's really confusing to me why I have such a strong desire to shave my legs for example, when the social pressure to do so for guys is the complete opposite.

I recently discovered /r/egg_irl/ and it is really messing with my head. I can identify with a lot of the memes, which itself is an inside joke there, looking at the memes, laughing because you find them relatable and saying ""uh oh what does that mean"" to yourself. I feel like I'm being gaslighted by an entire subreddit. I also saw a meme that said it's okay for men to be feminine and it's not okay to pressure them to be trans, and I felt relief when I saw this. Maybe I'm feeling pressure to put a label on myself?

I don't know if it's relevant but I have OCD and I'm also bisexual. I have already analyzed my sexual orientation to death, I just analyze everything all the time, I can't help it.

I know autogynephilia is an extremely sensitive topic in the trans community. This doesn't apply to me in that I don't recall ever having fantasized about literally being a woman in a sexual scenario, but I do think my desire to be more feminine is related to wanting to be desired, if that makes any sense. Idk really understand why though because I know masculinity is desired too, and I'm attracted to masculinity myself. I know if I work on myself and bulk up I'll get more attention. I've been complimented by being called ""handsome"", ""smoldering"" and for having a hairy chest, etc, I don't mind those compliments, they make me hate myself and my body hair a little less temporarily, but they don't do nearly as much for me as being called ""cute"", or being told I have pretty hands or that I move gracefully.

What should I do? Do I just need to accept myself? Do I have some kind body dysmorphia or gender confusion? Is this some kind of psychological fixation I just need to get over?

I decided not to make an argument about just tell her I'm not going to be in it, but apparently that's the wrong thing to do too. She blew up on me.

Perhaps some backstory would help you understand her side of the story. Her brother and my sister refuse to be in the wedding because her fiance is a guy from costa rica that she chats and video call a lot and met with for a week in his country. Their problem is also because of her ex being a dude she met on the internet too. They haven't met him, so they don't support it and that's that. I don't have an opinion on it. I just don't feel like I have a right to judge. Let her do whatever. Her life and all. Now with me not being in the wedding, apparently I'm not supporting her either and she's complaining about it to everyone now. So now everyone's going to judge me now for not doing this just cause of a measly dress.

I proposed them dressy jumpsuits, but apparently a bride is suppose to get whatever she wants at a wedding and she wants matching dresses. I decided not to make an argument about just tell her I'm not going to be in it, but apparently that's the wrong thing to do too. She blew up on me.\n\nPerhaps some backstory would help you understand her side of the story. Her brother and my sister refuse to be in the wedding because her fiance is a guy from costa rica that she chats and video call a lot and met with for a week in his country. Their problem is also because of her ex being a dude she met on the internet too. They haven't met him, so they don't support it and that's that. I don't have an opinion on it. I just don't feel like I have a right to judge. Let her do whatever. Her life and all. Now with me not being in the wedding, apparently I'm not supporting her either and she's complaining about it to everyone now. So now everyone's going to judge me now for not doing this just cause of a measly dress.\n\nIs there any advice or anything? I tried to tell her that dresses are REALLY uncomfortable for me, but she just compared it to her experiences and made it out to be not a big deal. It kinda hurts and frustrates me. I'm really not good at explaining things."", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'My mom wants me to wear a dress to a wedding', 'created': 1594090743.0}"

I think I might be agender, or at least nonbinary, but I'm not 100% sure. I've already made a few other posts about this on other subs and they've given me lots to think about but I wanted to come here and ask the wider nonbinary community about your specific experiences and how I might relate.

So I'm afab, but I've always had trouble with understanding exactly what it means to be female, what it means to ""feel"" like a certain gender. Like even most binary trans people say they experience their gender strongly, and they transition because of it. But I just don't get this. Like, I know I’m female because that’s what my body parts tell me I am, but I don’t feel any sort of inherent and long-standing happiness (or anything really) towards being female (or any gender). I do have little moments of euphoria when I do certain “masculine” things like cuffing/rolling up my sleeves to show my arms/muscles (even tho my arms are literal noodles lol), wearing men’s boxer briefs, or just wearing more gender neutral clothes. I also have similar moments of euphoria when doing little “feminine” things, like wearing rings/jewelry or wearing my hair a certain way. But the feelings aren't all that strong, and I definitely don’t have those feelings all the time/constantly.

I guess one of my biggest questions is how often do you feel your gender? Is it a constant knowing/feeling that you are your gender? Or is it more the little things that remind you of your gender, like I described? Again for me, it's almost as if my baseline is nothingness aka not thinking about my gender, but every once in a while I feel small surges of masculine or feminine energy and it makes me happy.

My assumption is that now that I have distanced myself enough from the 24 years of presenting masculine and now that I arrived in an identity that I feel comfortable in, I can play with masculinity again. Which is weird for me and maybe for others, too.

So, I started identifying as enby in 2016, only out to some friends, presenting masculine and still using he/him pronouns. 2 years ago this didnt feel right anymore and I needed to go some steps further, because most people still saw this seemingly cis dude that I wasnt. I moved to another city, used a different name and she/her pronouns and presented more feminine. I dont regret this at all, this was one of the best decisions I made in my life. I started HRT and got my name and gender marker changed (to a third gender option).

Here I am mostly involved in queer and FLINT spaces (german: women, lesbian, inter, nonbinary, trans - basically a no cis dude policy). I also live in a FLINT flat with 4 other amazing queer people that I would consider my family. When I talk to people about my gender identity I never use the words trans woman and almost always tell them about me being nonbinary and transfeminine. The problem is, people that I only know vaguely or just random strangers automatically assume that i am a binary trans woman when they hear I am using she/her pronouns.

As I said above, now I assume that with having a stronger standing in my enby transfem-ness I am not that opposed to masculinity anymore. Earlier I couldnt be associated with masc bc of all the negative emotions I had towards it for a long time.

So I feel very much confused rn. When people ""misgender"" me, I dont feel attacked that much and even my old name doesnt sound too bad anymore (and I also like the new one very much). This makes me feel like a fraud that was faking the whole thing even though I know I wasnt. I am just afraid that taking some steps back at the moment will confuse people and maybe even lead to more gatekeeping in those flint spaces.

And I dont know how to feel about HRT at the moment. Everything is going slowly anyways, because I dont take blockers, but i am not sure where I want this to go. When I think about a distant future, I can mostly see myself presenting androgynous, but I will wanna be able to not stand out and go unnoticed and I'd rather do that passing as a woman. So I want to have a more female passing body without being a trans woman.

2020-07-07 00:34:42,hmk7vy,3,1,"Hi all 

I’m not gonna lie this post is really hard for me to write and I’ll probably delete it. 

I’ve considered myself a girl my whole life. I’m afab, and was extremely girly when I was younger and still can be. 


Even though I was a very girly child, I guess I felt I never really fit in with girls, like there was always some part of the experience I was missing. I would want to be considered like other boys sometimes and my feelings would be hurt when I wouldn’t be included when the teacher was talking about boys in school. 

When I was maybe 18, I’m 24 now, i started to feel like there was something missing. Like I wasn’t quite right and didn’t fit in. I would go through different identities, and feel like maybe I was that, but would ultimately decide against in. 

A few months ago, my company said that everybody on my team has to make their pronouns visible on their work profiles, to raise awareness about respecting people’s gender identities. 

Right away this made my very uncomfortable; I guess I really didn’t like the idea of being thought of as anything! Like I’m just me. 

I decided to make my pronouns they them, without diving deeper. Because, when I think about gender identity it brings up intense feelings of anxiety. 

But, I’m not sure non binary is the right word either. Although, a part of that is maybe me being embarrassed and ashamed that I’m not normal, and also feeling like if I start saying that, my identity won’t be accepted. Which is weird, because I’m truly such a supportive person when it’s other people talking about their identities. I feel like I’m always educating others on gender is a spectrum and things like that. 

Also, sometimes I’m super sensitive about clothes that are gender specific. Like more recently, I have hated the idea of wearing dresses, because it just doesn’t feel like me.

IF you are comfortable, please share your age or age range just to get an idea of the consensus.

The character's name is Giko, they use they/them pronouns and they're nonhuman. Real quick, all the characters in this story are non-humans. The genre is a ""sexy sci-fi"" and the characters travels to different planets. I won't get into detail since at FIRST this was just an indulgecive story of mine but the more I think about these characters, the more I want to actually share them publicly instead privately or vaguely on my private twitter account.

I do not have a specific species name for Giko but Giko's species goes through sequential hermaphroditism but at will, not necessarily when they're only going to reproduce.
The species are either male or female at birth but that kind of information is trivial, rarely recorded, and many often forget their birth sex.*

Giko's species are humanoid. Remember, this oc/story of mine was for my fun/indulgence at first... Most of these characters are humanoids with other traits added (like horns, scales, fur, certain limb enlargements, black pupils, etc) but I wasn't very creative with Giko's species...
They basically look like humans except for their legs (they kinda look like feline back legs and have some fur that matches their natural color hair) and tails... I might add more into it but I say MIGHT bc I am very attached to first designs... I'm stubborn to change. My other ocs are very...orcish or elven or reptilian but with Giko I was like.....""I need a cat person oc..."" So yes, Giko's species looks like cat people, it's embarrassing to admit it bc I was just putting my ideals/types and now that I want to be public with these characters I don't want people to look a Giko and be like ""it's just a basic catgirl/carboy"" BC they are!!!!! 😭😔😔 Ahem..

Giko changes their physical appearance at will, how ever they like to feel comfortable that day. It's never big changes either, their face always remains the same, just their body type slightly changes (chest size and hips). I want to emphasize that Giko doesn't SHAPESHIFT. For example: Giko can't change their height, their height will remain the same, regardless their sex change. Also, Giko can't enlarge their chest size whatever size they want, they can't be an c-cup one day and then a g-cup the other. I want the species to be androgynous as much as possible BUT still have the masc/fem leaning spectrum (since I'm bigender and there will be days when I'm leaning more towards fem or masc).

Homophobia/Transphobia is non-existing in this universe. However, misogynistic ideas are somewhat existing in few planets or individuals. In Giko's planet is non-existing.

I think that's about it....again, please let me know any feedback, let me know if Giko's existence is...""problematic""(?) or hurtful to enbies... Or let me know if you have any questions.  Giko is still a ""rough draft"" character so I want to make sure I'm able to change them as much as I can before I publicly share this oc.

For a long time I just considered myself a straight woman who hates gender roles and my own body, and is attracted to different things than most people.  Thinking too much on my identity or sexuality has always been deeply frustrating and depressing, as neither my body or the world in general are at all suited to me.  But I've been thinking about it more recently, and maybe it helps if I define it and lean into it more.  

I've always hated gender roles, both female and male, and never felt attached to any of those ideas.  I see myself simply as a person who happens to have a vagina.  I would have preferred a male body, but not for gender reasons.  I strongly feel that gender is just a shitty human construct and it feels like a cage.  I'm not sure if it's more accurate to call myself agender, gender neutral, nonbinary, or something else?  I've so far stuck to female pronouns because it just seems simpler and doesn't bother me, I wonder does being referred to with neutral terms make you feel much different?  Does it make you feel acknowledged as your real self?

Physically, I really only like more gender-neutral bodies, both in myself and others.  I do not like curves or lumps, whether breasts, hips, muscles, etc.  Facial hair bothers me, and body hair disgusts me.  Square, masculine features repel me.  I am stuck with a very curvaceous body with a higher than average amount of dark body hair.  At best I can accept my body, but I could never love it or feel totally comfortable with it.  I can't even change it because there's no surgery for wide hips.  I can't really dress/style myself fully how I'd like because this body does not look good with alot of more ""masculine"" clothing and such.  I will look lumpy no matter, so I have to stick to what actually looks good on me, which is usually more feminine stuff... except for tank tops, I fucking love tank tops.

I very rarely ever find anyone sexually attractive.  Even just finding someone physically appealing at all is a rarity for me, and I cannot even begin to describe the frustration of it.  I very much want a partner, romantically and sexually, but it's like finding a needle in a haystack.  I've always considered myself straight due to not being attracted to breasts and vaginas, but I realized just recently that it's not like I find penises attractive either. All genitals are stupid looking and kind of gross.  I'm attracted to gender neutral bodies, I've just always felt... unsafe? considering them sexually if they are biologically female, because maybe people would look down on me.  But really?  I don't think it matters what genitals they have.  Does this make me bisexual, pansexual?  Does there exist a term for this specific attraction?  The closest I have found is ""skoliosexual"", but I feel like it's too broad for me and creates the wrong impression.

For some years I’ve always been super body conscious and I thought it was because I was a bigger sized person in my teens but after a year at the gym I caught myself in the mirror and snapped realized I’m maybe a half size larger than what I “should be” for my height and I even have a decent 4-pack showing and I still wasn’t happy. I took inventory of what I’m still not liking about myself and after doing some anatomy research went “I think I want look both male AND female?”

Fast forward 4 months of home workouts and lately I’ve been of the mindset of “if I met myself in passing and wasn’t already me… I’d probably try to talk me up” and that my issue isn’t that I’m unattractive” but I feel like I look more like a long lost brother than actually myself. I’ve also been noticing there’s a fair amount of feminine influence in how I act and speak at times.

I tried convincing myself I could exist as a Johnathon Van Ness wannabe for a while, started using just my last name which is just a single real word that makes me sound like a stereotypical hippy (but idk). Realizing that wasn’t who I wanted to look like (IE, I couldn’t see myself with a John Van Ness vibe) I started looking elsewhere.I got serious body issue feelings looking at Link’s BotW look but I know I cannot pull off a femboy look with my body structure (broad and wide… definitely not slender enough to ever pull it off the way I’d want to).

2020-07-08 01:26:38,hn7ne7,7,1,"Hey, so...I've been doing a ton of self-discoveries as of late and I've been allowing myself to do admit things to myself I've never had the courage to do before.  Because of this, I am now identifying as non-binary.  I've openly identified as bisexual since early high school.  I defended binary trans people, but I didn't defend non-binary trans people until a few years later.  Mostly out of ignorance and bad influences I admit, but I've changed my mind in early college and have defended all of the LGBT community ever sense.  So about 5 years.  Despite this, I haven't allowed myself to question my gender identity until recently even though at the back of my mind I have had suspicions and thoughts that I wouldn't admit to.

Maybe that was a lot of unnecessary backstory for this question but like I said I'm still processing a lot of shit and finding myself.

Anyways, one thing that I've been thinking about for years is my relationship to my breasts.  I've felt at best indifference to my breasts since they've developed and at worst uncomfortably whenever I feel like they're being sexualized.  It's hard to fully explain.  I've let people touch my breasts, mostly partners and mostly during sexual activity, but I've never really felt like I got much out of it.

Almost a year ago, the YouTuber Arielle Scarcella (who I no longer watch because her content nowadays frustrates me more then anything) posted [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3Gy_JI8Jho) of a cis lesbian who got top surgery.  I remember loving this video so much cause I never knew cis girls could get top surgery (I doubt I'm cis but you get what I mean).  I thought that was mostly limited to trans men.  I consider myself non-binary now but the idea of top surgery is something I've been thinking about A LOT recently.   I actually feel like I want to go through with this.  I don't have to deal with bras, I don't have to deal with people sexualizing that part of my body, hell I could even go completely topless and not have to worry about being sexualized or whatever.

So I guess this is where I start asking my questions.

1. Is it easy for a AFAB individual to receive top surgery without transitioning to male (cause I am NOT a man and I don't want to be).
2. Realistically, would society treat me any different for appearing female but with a ""male"" chest?
3. How much money would this cost and how would I go about doing this.
4. Does anyone have any experience with this first hand?
5. And any advice for where to go to learn more about top surgery?  And, while I'm at it, where to go to learn more about being non-binary?  Or non-binary related surgeries/hormone treatments?

TL;DR: body issues best described as “NB with a lean towards male” not sure who they are or what to do about it.

For some years I’ve always been super body conscious and I thought it was because I was a bigger sized person in my teens but after a year at the gym I caught myself in the mirror and snapped realized I’m maybe a half size larger than what I “should be” for my height and I even have a decent 4-pack showing and I still wasn’t happy.

I’ve also been noticing there’s a fair amount of feminine influence in how I act and speak at times.

I tried convincing myself I could exist as a Johnathon Van Ness wannabe for a while, started using just my last name which is just a single real word that makes me sound like a stereotypical hippy (but idk). Realizing that wasn’t who I wanted to look like (IE, I couldn’t see myself with a John Van Ness vibe) I started looking elsewhere.I got serious body issue feelings looking at Link’s BotW look but I know I cannot pull off a twink look with my body structure (broad and wide… definitely not slender enough to ever pull it off the way I’d want to).

I started to be more realistic with myself and look into muscular/solid androgyny, sorta slightly built-up wide androgynous. I vibed with that hard enough to at least dream of a person like that in my clothes just at peace but I couldn’t see their face, which… I know the psychology of the brain being unable to create an original face but putting them against a sunset to avoid trying was still a dirty trick I played on myself. The closet I can identify that version of me is… drag queen but natural which doesn’t quite describe them/me either. I don’t really even know if it’s a gender issue or I just don’t like my face despite being someone I’d consider attractive.

It’s not that I fully disagree with male either.

I took inventory of what I’m still not liking about myself and after doing some anatomy research went “I think I want look both male AND female?”\n\nFast forward 4 months of home workouts and lately I’ve been of the mindset of “if I met myself in passing and wasn’t already me… I’d probably try to talk me up” and that my issue isn’t that I’m unattractive” but I feel like I look more like a long lost brother than actually myself. I’ve also been noticing there’s a fair amount of feminine influence in how I act and speak at times.\n\nI tried convincing myself I could exist as a Johnathon Van Ness wannabe for a while, started using just my last name which is just a single real word that makes me sound like a stereotypical hippy (but idk). Realizing that wasn’t who I wanted to look like (IE, I couldn’t see myself with a John Van Ness vibe) I started looking elsewhere.I got serious body issue feelings looking at Link’s BotW look but I know I cannot pull off a twink look with my body structure (broad and wide… definitely not slender enough to ever pull it off the way I’d want to).\n\nI started to be more realistic with myself and look into muscular/solid androgyny, sorta slightly built-up wide androgynous. I vibed with that hard enough to at least dream of a person like that in my clothes just at peace but I couldn’t see their face, which… I know the psychology of the brain being unable to create an original face but putting them against a sunset to avoid trying was still a dirty trick I played on myself. The closet I can identify that version of me is… drag queen but natural which doesn’t quite describe them/me either. I don’t really even know if it’s a gender issue or I just don’t like my face despite being someone I’d consider attractive.\n\nIt’s not that I fully disagree with male either.

&amp;#x200B;

I've known most my life that I don't enjoy being called feminine things, and I HATE being called ""girlie, girl, lady, miss"" etc. Since I was about 12 I think I knew deep down I was NB, or at least not cis. I've finally decided I'ma call myself NB, as a general title. While I know I'm not male, and I hate being thought of as female, NB still feels really scary and uncomfortable to title myself as. I know this is something a lot of people experience, the slight discomfort of something new even if it's the right direction. And things like my mom saying ""girl- I mean dude"" and such makes me so so happy, but also so anxious. Even typing this, I feel my heart racing.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I know I'm NB of sorts, but I'm not used to believing it myself, and thus anything to do with it makes me really anxious. When does this feeling start to die down (or at least not trigger when having gender euphoria), and how can I help myself feel comfortable with my identify faster?

While reflecting on my gender I realized that I'd focus on my discomfort and -why- I felt uncomfortable during different situations. Ultimately I think it makes sense to feel uncomfortable when other people project inaccurate gender expectations on you, but I seem to be more sensitive to it than seems usual.

However, I've come to the conclusion that I've been coming at all this from the wrong direction. I don't need to focus on what feels bad.

I'm fine with feminine pronouns, they accurately describe me. However, I *also feel happy* at just the idea of being called ""they/them.""

It just makes me happy, and feels right and good. I've kind of always felt a certain ""default/neutral human"" mode to how I interact with the world, and when people try to ascribe gendered labels to personal attributes I consider a-gender, it rubs me the wrong way.

Growing up in a more conservative area where people take for granted that men just ""focus on thinking more,"" and women ""focus on their feelings more,"" the idea of reason being a masculine trait really irks me. Any perception that I am masculine is incorrect, no matter how intellectually focused I may be. 

Even the idea of, ""developing both male and female traits"" to find balance doesn't really make sense to me. Why are these attributes (intellect, emotion, empathy, etc.) so gendered in the first place if we can all cultivate them to some extent or another? It's like suggesting only women can cook--when we all have hands and eyes and can read instructions!

It's not that I don't think there aren't any differences in experiences, but I think these differences are largely artificial and can be bridged with active empathy building. 

If we can all have healthy relationships with our thoughts and feelings, then why the artificial divide? 

Anyway, I just think we've compartmentalized the human experience way more than it needs to be, and I'm sure I'm preaching to the choir here but I appreciate anyone who's taken the time to listen.

2020-07-08 19:03:31,hnn67f,0,1,"This issue has confused me all of my life and feels like a major puzzle piece.

I first explored cross-dressing when I was a young goth/punk in the late 80's and early 90's.  Being androgynous was just part of the scene - it was an extremely homophobic age (the 80's were particularly vile), and openly cross dressing without a reference to genre was nearly...dangerous!

However, within the confines of scene fashion, it was acceptable to experiment - and I did, a lot.  So much that I thought I was gay.  I just so loved wearing feminine things; it just followed to me that - okay, if I really do like this in a 'real' way...then that means I must like men...right?

Being that bisexuality was somewhat lauded in the goth scene - it was pretty easy to find guys who liked me.  So - I tried.  And - it didn't work.  Worked for them - men love me (lol) - however, I realized that I'm just not gay.  Men don't do it for me on a fundamental level.

So - I convinced myself that it was just me having fun and a 'phase'.  Life went on, the scene died, and pragmatism forced me to go corporate/straight.  I forgot about how much fun I had dressing in girl things, and gaslit myself into thinking 'oh that was just me being weird'.   I did honestly like women - they are my sexual orientation - and I eventually married a beautiful woman who was a manipulative and abusive narcissist and who completely destroyed my life over a 9 year period and pretty much left me a ruined and nearly dead shell.

That nearly dead shell of a human being somehow did not die and - without any internal identity at all - I began to try to climb.  I'd been gaslit for years - it's all very complicated - I was so extremely lost.  I was like living sentience - sentience in agony - with no idea of who or what or anything that I was.  I was merely alive.

It has now been several years since my abuser left my world, and the climb since has been fierce and beyond agony.  I had terrible CPTSD (it's not completely gone however much better) - I would be lost in emotional flashbacks for days at a time - and burrowing out of that has been the hardest thing I have done in my entire life without a doubt.

Over the last year and a half or so, I've gotten myself involved in an immersive theater acting troupe.  I consensually terrify the shit out of people - for fun.  The inner immersive theater world is extremely accepting - I have friends who truly love me now and who want me to be who I am.  I'm tearing up just writing that sentence.  To be alone and abused so long and then to have this...it is precious.

I confess also psychedelics have helped.  They do help to burn down the trauma and help you to perceive who you really are.  Further, as bad as this quarantine is, it's certainly giving a girl time to think about who they truly are.

To get to the point of this entire post - I've come to accept that I am non-binary, and I feel I am evolving towards transfemme.  I don't ever want to change my body (I like my body), however I just love wearing gothy/punk feminine things and being...feminine.

I have already typed so much more than I meant to - I only started this post because I wanted to ask a question on how common creatures like me are.  I mean, it sounds like a joke - 'a gay woman trapped in a man's body'.  Earlier, I described myself to a friend as 'a lesbian with a permanent strap-on'.  Are there many out there like me?  Individuals who are functionally heterosexual (which made it so easy to lie to myself) however trans in their hearts?

If anyone wants to see/follow a middle-aged punk/goth awakening trans type person, go give 'tristansinns' on Instagram a follow.   The last video was from the 4th, when I got high as a kite on psychedelics and danced on my balcony eating watermelon while my neighbors shot tons of fireworks over my head.  It was a magical evening and it was that day that I fully accepted that I am evolving towards transfemme; I only have so many years left to live, and I really want to live them as the creature I am.

2020-07-09 21:42:23,hoc0gi,4,1,"howdy, good evening! you can call me kadin ( it's not my real name, or my chosen one it's simply a nickname ) and i am a afab and a non binary identifying person. i've been questioning my gender for an awfully long time, and over the last 4 months or so have started making attempts to express myself.

&amp;#x200B;

i absolutely adore this subreddit, and would always check out the posts even before i created my account, it's part of what fuels me. so anyways, i am highly feminine appearing, and i am trying to remedy this. i am going to try get my hands on a binder, but we're currently in a bad financial situation and i'm unsure when this will be possible - which sucks due to my dysphoria.

&amp;#x200B;

my main issue is i have tried to come out ( namely to my mother ) who has taken it rather badly, stating that i'm being silly and that this doesn't exist. it's made me question myself, what if i am just faking? i know i am most likely just enabling self loathing but it's been bothering me greatly. only a few people know me by they/them and i'm unsure whether to open up more - or how to limit my femininity.

&amp;#x200B;

so  to summarise:

&amp;#x200B;

\- i adore this subreddit! and i adore all of you, you inspire me.

\- does anybody know any good methods to cope with dysphoria and/or limit my feminine appearence?

\- if anybody knows how to cope with my self doubt and the disapproval from my family i could really use advice

My family just started talking to me again when I started dating my boyfriend. Since my brother came out for me, that I had a girlfriend, they ignored me and I was basically homeless. 
But I still love my family and I want them to be there when I marry someday.

I know I will need the courage to come out someday, but I always hoped to postpone it, until I talked about generel gender identity with my parents. Without my gender in the context.

1) i found a name that makes me feel super happy and gender affirmed (Wyn), but im so anxious at the idea of actually using it and making people switch to calling me something else. then what if i end up not liking it? and switch back? ig if someone else asked me this i'd tell them to go for it, but it just feels like a very overwhelming prospect. 

2) i feel like i'd feel more comfortable asking people to call me a new name if i felt like i conformed more to what ""nonbinary"" looks like in people's heads. i kinda just still look the same as i've always looked -- shorter hair, though no longer super short, wear more femme clothing (AFAB) -- and i feel shy talking about being agender/enby publicly so i just have it listed in like bios and such. so i guess i feel like because of that, it'll be more unexpected to friends, and it'll make me feel invalidated to be more open about it?

3) is it (gender stuff) supposed to feel like this slow progression? i've been feeling since 2017/2018 or so that i'm not really a girl... and agender as an ID feels homey to me... but i still relate to girl stuff sometimes and the feeling i get when i'm gendered as a girl is mostly annoyance/awareness that it's not right but i'm not sure if that's dysphoria or just something i'm making up? the feeling keeps growing though and i've since switched to using both she and they pronouns, considering just using they, and now i'm thinking of a new name... so...

4) kind of a silly question but i really want that haircut thats short and side parted and kind of 90s boy -- anyone know what thats called so i can look it up?? or reply with pics of your own so i can have inspo for whenever i can finally get to the hairdresser/DIY it, ha! :D

2020-07-10 19:14:46,hov663,2,1,"I just started coming to terms with being non-binary very recently.
Last night I opened up my old Bumble account and updated my profile stating I am questioning my gender identity.    I had two wonderful open conversations with women who were matched to my old profile, not surprisingly neither went anywhere but it was a very positive affirming experience that I wasn’t  expecting.  It was the polar opposite of the stressful awkward experiences I  previously had with dating apps. 

I started an ok Cupid account a few hours ago and I was expecting a very slow reaction to my open  profile approach but I’ve already got 20 likes. That may actually be really low, I don’t know what’s typical but I thought 1 per day would be optimistic.  Of course I think the 4 photos I used in my profile might be the only photos I have of myself from the past few years, all looking cisgender.  I’m guessing most were just swiping on photos.   Capturing some new photos of myself for my profile might be a big next step for me.

So is ok Cupid a good service for someone on the non-binary spectrum?  Also I’m turning 38 in a few days, does that make a big difference which app would be better?  Which apps are worth paying for?

That may actually be really low, I don’t know what’s typical but I thought 1 per day would be optimistic.  Of course I think the 4 photos I used in my profile might be the only photos I have of myself from the past few years, all looking cisgender.  I’m guessing most were just swiping on photos.   Capturing some new photos of myself for my profile might be a big next step for me.\n\nSo is ok Cupid a good service for someone on the non-binary spectrum?  Also I’m turning 38 in a few days, does that make a big difference which app would be better?  Which apps are worth paying for?\nAny profile tips?

I've recently found out that I'm genderfluxx and even before finding that out I've considered getting a binder or breast reduction surgery. The thing is I have absolutely no idea how binders work or where to get them and even if they would work for me. It's very complicated and I would love if people had recommendations or could share their knowledge of it. I'm guessing most people do not wear them here but I'm desperate for answers and I'm not sure trying on the Trans subreddit would be appropriate.

Because basically I'm fluctuating between being girl, being demigirl-agender and being just agender. Even when I'm feeling like a girl I still feel a bit uneasy with my breast (because I have really big boobs) but on the days where I am feeling agender or demigirl it causes me dysphoria which I already have for other reasons. I want to try getting a binder but I'm looking for one that wouldn't conceal my breast completely (which is why I feel it'd be inappropriate on the Trans subreddit). I'm feeling demigirl on most days and even girl on some so I still feel like having a bit of breast is reflecting how I feel about my gender. I also like wearing low-neck and crop top regardless of how I feel and I don't know how that would work with a binder but maybe there's some new things I don't know about so feel free to share.

Not all of us are fluent in the language of gender, and too often, we confuse gender with sex, which can leave room for a lot of confusion.

Many agender people also identify as genderqueer, non-binary and/or [transgender](https://gender.wikia.org/wiki/Transgender).

But anyway, I was born a girl, but I‘d always considered myself a tomboy when I was younger (before I really knew much about trans/nb people). I spent a lot of time with male friends and always kind of wished I was born a boy and had a dick. In middle school, I hung out mostly with girls but also with boys sometimes - my school was very small and my grade was mostly all friends (we all ate together and shit), though we had our separate smaller friend groups. I went to a very accepting school too (also, in the 16 ish people in out grade at the time, less than half were straight and like 4 people including me were either not cis or gender questioning). In maybe 6th grade, I started to realize I maybe wasn’t 100% cis. I called myself a demigirl in my head, but that didn’t feel right and also felt too specific. See, I *like* being a girl. I also *like* when I go out in public occasionally and someone misgenders me as male. I like wearing dresses (and occasionally skirts but not as much), but I also like wearing stereotypically masculine clothing. I also hate the idea of having breasts/vagina and kind of wish I had a dick (although some of those reasons are related to practicality - eg peeing in the woods -_-) 

I think if anything, I might be nonbinary, but honestly no pronouns feel right? Like I feel awkward when someone says “miss” or “young lady” or whatever, but I also feel a little bit awkward when someone uses he/him, and the idea of using they/them for me personally is really weird, although not awful. 

I’m also scared my family won’t understand - my moms I’m not worried about, but I’m scared my grandparents (who I’m very close with) won’t get it or won’t use the right pronouns or will think I’m faking it for attention. Another thing is that I’ve lived as a girl my whole life, so it feels scary to change. I’m worried my brain is just making this up to feel special or something.

I’m new here (and to reddit), but I’ve been wanting to talk to someone about this for awhile and I’m not sure where to do it, and this is the best place I’ve found so far.\n\nBut anyway, I was born a girl, but I‘d always considered myself a tomboy when I was younger (before I really knew much about trans/nb people). I spent a lot of time with male friends and always kind of wished I was born a boy and had a dick. In middle school, I hung out mostly with girls but also with boys sometimes - my school was very small and my grade was mostly all friends (we all ate together and shit), though we had our separate smaller friend groups. I went to a very accepting school too (also, in the 16 ish people in out grade at the time, less than half were straight and like 4 people including me were either not cis or gender questioning). In maybe 6th grade, I started to realize I maybe wasn’t 100% cis. I called myself a demigirl in my head, but that didn’t feel right and also felt too specific. See, I *like* being a girl. I also *like* when I go out in public occasionally and someone misgenders me as male. I like wearing dresses (and occasionally skirts but not as much), but I also like wearing stereotypically masculine clothing. I also hate the idea of having breasts/vagina and kind of wish I had a dick (although some of those reasons are related to practicality - eg peeing in the woods -_-) \n\nI think if anything, I might be nonbinary, but honestly no pronouns feel right? Like I feel awkward when someone says “miss” or “young lady” or whatever, but I also feel a little bit awkward when someone uses he/him, and the idea of using they/them for me personally is really weird, although not awful. \n\nI’m also scared my family won’t understand - my moms I’m not worried about, but I’m scared my grandparents (who I’m very close with) won’t get it or won’t use the right pronouns or will think I’m faking it for attention. Another thing is that I’ve lived as a girl my whole life, so it feels scary to change. I’m worried my brain is just making this up to feel special or something. \n\nAnyway, I just needed to get this off my chest (ha ha) and tell *someone* about it.

2020-07-12 00:14:51,hpkvbx,3,1,"**TLDR: When is the right time to come out publicly? How do you know you're ready?**

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry this is long :(

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure where to begin. I've always known I'm not cis or straight, but didn't start coming to terms with my gender and sexuality until I started college. I just graduated, as financially stable as young adults get, and am planning my wedding. I feel like I'm in a good place now to start being out in a more public capacity. I'm already out at one of my jobs, to my friends, and to a very select few family members. I'm not afraid of what former classmates, old acquaintances, and people from my hometown will think anymore. Being out just seems like the next logical step for me. But every time I think of my extended family, I ache inside. There are some I know for a fact will reject me, and some I don't know how they'll react. I was very close to my extended family growing up- my grandparents and uncles on one side of the family lived in the same house as me and helped raise me and my brother. My aunts on the other side of the family treated us as their own, and my cousins were more like siblings to me, and they felt the same about us and our mom.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not as close with my aunts anymore in large part due to extreme ideological differences. They are 100% not on board with LGBTQ+/queer rights. My cousins are quietly for those rights, but have to take their parents' side so they don't get ""accused"" and thrown out of the house. The uncles and grandparents I grew up with, on the other hand, I'm still very close with. We see each other all the time. They say they're accepting, but the jokes they make and the way they talk about queer issues tells me they might not be as accepting as they think. I'm terrified that my decision to come out will ultimately tear my family apart. Not only will I lose those lifelong relationships, but so will other family members as supportive vs non-supportive in-fighting breaks out among them. People will be forced to take sides. That's just how they are.

&amp;#x200B;

Intellectually speaking, I know I'm better off without any asshole who would disown me and mine for the fact of my gender identity and sexuality. I know it's better to be without them. But the idea of losing those people is still very painful to me. I'm holding myself back from taking any steps toward gender affirmation for fear of what will happen in my family. I feel like I'm torn between the choice to live authentically, or live harmoniously. I want to move forward but I can't get around this block. I feel resentment and anger. Sometimes I want to come out as loudly and publicly as possible and tell them deal with it or don't, I don't care. But I do care. Other times, I think maybe it would be better to start the process of coming out to each of them individually, even though it would be agonizing for me (especially if I get rejected multiple times in a row...) and possibly even unsafe. I don't know what to do. Am I just not as ready as I thought I was? Is it just not the right time? Is it *ever* the right time?

The uncles and grandparents I grew up with, on the other hand, I\'m still very close with. We see each other all the time. They say they\'re accepting, but the jokes they make and the way they talk about queer issues tells me they might not be as accepting as they think. I\'m terrified that my decision to come out will ultimately tear my family apart. Not only will I lose those lifelong relationships, but so will other family members as supportive vs non-supportive in-fighting breaks out among them. People will be forced to take sides. That\'s just how they are.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIntellectually speaking, I know I\'m better off without any asshole who would disown me and mine for the fact of my gender identity and sexuality. I know it\'s better to be without them. But the idea of losing those people is still very painful to me. I\'m holding myself back from taking any steps toward gender affirmation for fear of what will happen in my family. I feel like I\'m torn between the choice to live authentically, or live harmoniously. I want to move forward but I can\'t get around this block. I feel resentment and anger. Sometimes I want to come out as loudly and publicly as possible and tell them deal with it or don\'t, I don\'t care. But I do care. Other times, I think maybe it would be better to start the process of coming out to each of them individually, even though it would be agonizing for me (especially if I get rejected multiple times in a row...) and possibly even unsafe. I don\'t know what to do. Am I just not as ready as I thought I was? Is it just not the right time? Is it *ever* the right time?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone has advice or personal anecdotes they want to share, please do. I\'m really struggling right now.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'When is the right time to come out publicly?', 'created': 1594538091.0}"

TW: discussing how I feel about parts of my afab body, brief eating disorder mention


For my whole life, I've sort of identified as a tomboy. As a kid, I scorned anything feminine and was proud if I was seen as boyish (internalized misogyny?). I'm still like this to some extent, though I've learned to embrace the feminine things I enjoy (knitting/crocheting, enjoying flowers, wearing bright colors, loving cute animals, talking about emotions, having nice handwriting, etc.) I often wished I was a boy as a kid, but I feel that's common among young girls who are coming to grips with shitty gender roles, esp growing up in a conservative Christian household.

When I hit puberty I got a really womanly body, which I hated and still do. I developed an eating disorder and would wear baggy clothes a lot. I still hated wearing makeup, jewelry, and skirts. I wanted my chest to be flat as a board and my hips to be nonexistent. I still identified as a girl and was holding myself to (very extreme) feminine beauty standards, but I felt deeply, fundamentally out of place among other, more feminine girls (yes, I leaned HARD into the #notlikemostgirls mindset to cope with that) and felt most comfortable in androgynous clothes. 

Fast forward to now. I'm 20 and in the process of trying to find a style/presentation that I feel most comfortable and confident with, trying not to take into account what others think. (I think this has only been possible because my attraction to men has been waning, which I think was/is really the only thing driving me to pursue any sort of external femininity.) I've started wearing boxers, tossed all my tight jeans and feminine tops, grew out my body hair, and started binding my chest. I feel more comfortable in my body than I ever have. I think I want to eventually achieve complete androgyny in my presentation. 

It's got me wondering if I should start identifying as nonbinary. In a way, I already do, as I don't believe my gender has much bearing on who I am and what I do day to day. I hate the idea of being treated differently in a situation than a man would be treated, even if it's in a positive way. I want all my secondary sex characteristics gone. I have no desire to give birth to and nurse kids (though I do want to adopt/foster some day). I just don't take the identity of ""woman"" into account when I think of myself, and don't feel like I fit in with people who do. And I've felt this way about things for as long as I can remember.

But at the same time I don't feel the need to change my name or pronouns at all. I don't mind being called a girl or introducing myself as one, unless someone is fixating on it or trying to assume things about me/have certain expectations because of my gender. I wouldn't mind being called they or he either (I got a rush when the Postmates guy called me sir over the phone), but I don't expect anyone to do so without me asking, and I don't care enough to ask. I also would never transition medically, as the thought of having a deep voice and facial hair is weird to me, and I'm indifferent to having a penis. (Though I'd love to have more body hair, a flat chest, and a more angular/muscular body). I also kind of like the way my face looks and wouldn't wanna mess that up.

At the end of the day though, I don't feel the need to come out or anything, as it won't change anything about how I live, and I'm not really one to lean hard into gender/sexuality as an important identity of mine (no shade towards people who do, I just like to keep it private. Probably internalized trans/homophobia, idk). So does it even matter if I identify as nonbinary vs just as a tomboyish girl? Isn't it really just for myself? And if I don't really care about my gender, shouldn't it not matter? Why am I thinking about it so much? Is this all just a result of internalized misogyny and wanting to avoid the suffocating box of Christian womanhood+society's sexualization of female bodies?

Idk if these things have answers. Just wanted to reflect and get it off my chest I guess. Please feel free to share your thoughts or related experiences on my blurb.

My sexuality + sexual orientation, and my emotional range have all felt very ill-fitting and have lead to lots of social anxiety, frustration, hopelessness, I just feel like the things I desire to feel, or feel deep down, are out of reach. I feel like my body and the hormones I have might be the cause for all of this fog and feeling of the ways that things just don't fit. I wanna hear how someone felt in these areas after starting HRT. And also what it felt like before!! I am not certain that it is a hormonal problem, but after learning more about all of this and identifying my discomforts, I am starting to believe that it just may be."", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'HRT effects on sexuality and emotion', 'created': 1594626870.0}"

2020-07-13 03:13:51,hq7rde,1,1,"So a few days ago I accidentally hit my ribs against something with quite a bit of strength whilst binding. It was very painful and the binder didn't help, spent the next 5 minutes riding out the dull/numb pain(my binder is sized correctly and never causes me pain or shortness of breath. It just made if feel slightly worse than it would've been if I hadn't been binding) . So, naturally, when this event is coupled with the fact I've been binding the entire week or so before hand, I decide I need to take a break.

And, I will be honest here. For once, I had nothing in mind but to follow through dispite how much I hate not binding. I was good, I was dutifully following through without even sparing my binder a mere glance. I promised myself that I wouldn't put it on unless plans suddenly changed, as I have basically no control over plans for the most part and doing anything without my binder made my dysphoria act up like a major bitch.

Guess what happened. Yep. Plans changed. I ended up with my binder on for probably 2 hours, ruining my intended 24 hour break.

OK, fine. I'll do it today then. It's fine. Today will be my break. Hopefully nothing will come up. I declined to going to the store(which I'd typically jump at the chance for) because I'd have to bind because as I said, dysphoria is a bitch that never let's me rest and loves to act out outside of the house.

A friendly acquaintance comes over and wants to hang out. I'm not typically up for socializing and this was a surprise(haven't talked for... God, maybe 4 months? More?), but why not. This entire scenario is unlikely to happen again and I was bored and I had a fully charged social battery.
And so, I put on my binder and went out, having it on for about... 3 hours maybe? I had fun and I don't regret it but holy shit.

can I just get one day where I can have a complete break? A full 24hour season, from when I wake up to when I pass out without me putting on my binder even once.

I want to bind safely, I try my hardest to bind safely. I plan my binding around when I'll be most active and in the realm of safety. Breaks are part of safe binding, and even if I don't think it's as important now that I have an actual binder and not 2 too small sports bras to bind, I still think I should take a break every now and then.

Today, he sent me a voice message and asked me if we wanted to hang out and grab a beer tomorrow, since the 14th of July is nonbinary visibility day.

I avoid ""guys"" because that has masc connotations to me.

As a small child, I really liked ""girly"" stuff (pink, makeup, etc.).

At about 7 I started to become more of a ""tomboy"", I preferred shopping in the boys' section of clothing stores and preferred ""boyish"" activities.

At 10 I cut off all of my hair, I was so happy. I loved it when people mistook me for a boy and called me ""Julian"". I hated going into public bathrooms. I always felt ashamed and embarrassed. I would try to always go with a female relative, to use them as a sort of shield, like; ""look, she's clearly a girl, and I'm with her, so it's okay for me to be here, so please don't stare at me."" I felt uncomfortable with my body as I entered puberty.

I felt extremely embarrassed and ashamed to do anything I deemed ""girly"", such as makeup or the Sims (yeah, that last one didn't make much sense to me at the time either), even if no one else had a problem with it. Eventually, these activities' place in my mind as ""taboo"" would make me want to do them. So, I would try them out in secret, quickly get bored, and forget about them.

At 15, despite my deep embarrassment, I decided to grow my hair out, and slowly, over the course of the last few years, wear ""girlier"" stuff (still no dresses or skirts though).

I had mostly forgotten the dysphoria of my past, until, a few months ago, I saw Ted Talk by a young non-binary person. So many of their experiences were similar to mine, and it brought back all of those feelings. I suddenly became very aware of my outfit, long hair, and breasts, and became very uncomfortable.

I have been telling myself that ""gender isn't that important to me, I don't really care how people perceive or refer to me"", and ""it's too much trouble anyway to have everyone refer to me differently."" But, I'm not so sure that that's true. I feel uncomfortable and stressed about my uncertain gender identity, and dealing with my parents should I identify as non-binary and choose to use they/them pronouns (I have gotten into heated discussions with my parents about the misgendering of non-binary people, and why it's important to respect everyone's pronouns).

2020-07-14 02:03:05,hqsrwz,1,1,"I'll try to keep this short. Ok, that failed as this is loooong.

7 weeks ago at 32 years old I found the names for what I am. I'm a proud AroAce. My life suddenly made a lot of sense. And I've became very openly out too. As I was SICK of hiding so I hide no longer.

I've fought many demons and bad memories and put them to bed over discovering why I was so different to EVERYONE else.

But slight gaps were still missing and someone called me Non Binary a few weeks back and it came as a shock, because I've only ever thought I was male.

Except then it happened again with Agender. And then I started noticing how every AroAce I met wasn't male or female except 1 good friend.

So I asked her and she had had the same experience with people saying she wasn't her birth given gender. 

So we decided to research gender as we'd both been avoiding it and I'll not say what she found for privacy reasons, even though I'm not naming her as AroAce's are crazy rare, so it wouldn't be hard to work out with enough details. But after I explained a lot of things about myself she said I was screaming NB to her too.

So I found an NB with Autism (I have Aspergers which is why working out I was NB was as difficult) and they confirmed to me that everything I feel and speak about screams that I am indeed NB.

So that came as a shock and it took a week to digest. 

I've told my family and friends and pro nouns were brought up and TBH I kinda froze, as I haven't actually felt like a man a day in my life, hell I've not even felt human/like a damn person either, so the idea of ""they/them"" isn't for me as it makes me feel like I'm saying I'm 2 people.

I'm definitely not trans as in a woman in a man's body so ""she/her"" doesn't feel right either. It feels insulting to trans if I were to say I was as that's for people with daily dysphoria and who want HRT.

And my dysphoria went after puberty (I HATED having a penis during puberty and I was willing to remove it at the time. After puberty stopped the dysphoria went thankfully).

So for now I'm ""he/him"" and ""sir"" but I worry I'm being a bad or even fraudulent NB by passing as male essentially.

""He/him"" feels OK though, I don't cringe or feel misgendered even though I don't feel I have a gender. 

But I don't love it either.

Which brings me to my male name, I hate it, I've always hated it, I've got many memories where I avoided using it, where I hoped I'd get a nickname so I could go by that instead, where I outright cried as a child to my mam as ""I don't feel like a David"".

The name I use online is the ONLY name I enjoy using and it is genderless, but they've outright said they refuse to call me DEMON. 

They know this is my online name, I've used it for 20 years, they know I use it IRL too. I've said for decades DEMON is the real me as online was the only place I didn't have to act and lie, to be anyone else, but my real persona.

Which brings me back to pro nouns as my brother jokingly said ""so if we start calling you DEMON, would we have to say the dark lord? Because I'm not saying that"" and the sad part is, I love it.

Like I love it more than I probably should. And I even then gave examples...

""Where's DEMON?""

""The dark lord is sleeping off a migraine""

""What does DEMON want to eat?""

""The dark lord wants pizza""

Annnnnnd my mam and my brother stared at me in such a way that says ""he's insane"" which if I wasn't already feeling insecure and vulnerable I'd have informed them that they should try passing as a straight male for 32 years then 7 weeks before your 33rd birthday you find out you're neither straight nor even technically male and it explains why you've always felt like an Alien and we'll see just how ""sane"" you are...

Ok, that failed as this is loooong.\n\n7 weeks ago at 32 years old I found the names for what I am. I\'m a proud AroAce. My life suddenly made a lot of sense. And I\'ve became very openly out too. As I was SICK of hiding so I hide no longer.\n\nI\'ve fought many demons and bad memories and put them to bed over discovering why I was so different to EVERYONE else.\n\nBut slight gaps were still missing and someone called me Non Binary a few weeks back and it came as a shock, because I\'ve only ever thought I was male.\n\nExcept then it happened again with Agender. And then I started noticing how every AroAce I met wasn\'t male or female except 1 good friend.\n\nSo I asked her and she had had the same experience with people saying she wasn\'t her birth given gender. \n\nSo we decided to research gender as we\'d both been avoiding it and I\'ll not say what she found for privacy reasons, even though I\'m not naming her as AroAce\'s are crazy rare, so it wouldn\'t be hard to work out with enough details. But after I explained a lot of things about myself she said I was screaming NB to her too.\n\nSo I found an NB with Autism (I have Aspergers which is why working out I was NB was as difficult) and they confirmed to me that everything I feel and speak about screams that I am indeed NB.\n\nSo that came as a shock and it took a week to digest. \n\nI\'ve told my family and friends and pro nouns were brought up and TBH I kinda froze, as I haven\'t actually felt like a man a day in my life, hell I\'ve not even felt human/like a damn person either, so the idea of ""they/them"" isn\'t for me as it makes me feel like I\'m saying I\'m 2 people.\n\nI\'m definitely not trans as in a woman in a man\'s body so ""she/her"" doesn\'t feel right either. It feels insulting to trans if I were to say I was as that\'s for people with daily dysphoria and who want HRT.\n\nAnd my dysphoria went after puberty (I HATED having a penis during puberty and I was willing to remove it at the time. After puberty stopped the dysphoria went thankfully).\n\nSo for now I\'m ""he/him"" and ""sir"" but I worry I\'m being a bad or even fraudulent NB by passing as male essentially.\n\n""He/him"" feels OK though, I don\'t cringe or feel misgendered even though I don\'t feel I have a gender. \n\nBut I don\'t love it either.\n\nWhich brings me to my male name, I hate it, I\'ve always hated it, I\'ve got many memories where I avoided using it, where I hoped I\'d get a nickname so I could go by that instead, where I outright cried as a child to my mam as ""I don\'t feel like a David"".\n\nThe name I use online is the ONLY name I enjoy using and it is genderless, but they\'ve outright said they refuse to call me DEMON. \n\nThey know this is my online name, I\'ve used it for 20 years, they know I use it IRL too. I\'ve said for decades DEMON is the real me as online was the only place I didn\'t have to act and lie, to be anyone else, but my real persona.\n\nWhich brings me back to pro nouns as my brother jokingly said ""so if we start calling you DEMON, would we have to say the dark lord? Because I\'m not saying that"" and the sad part is, I love it.\n\nLike I love it more than I probably should. And I even then gave examples...\n\n""Where\'s DEMON?""\n\n""The dark lord is sleeping off a migraine""\n\n""What does DEMON want to eat?""\n\n""The dark lord wants pizza""\n\nAnnnnnnd my mam and my brother stared at me in such a way that says ""he\'s insane"" which if I wasn\'t already feeling insecure and vulnerable I\'d have informed them that they should try passing as a straight male for 32 years then 7 weeks before your 33rd birthday you find out you\'re neither straight nor even technically male and it explains why you\'ve always felt like an Alien and we\'ll see just how ""sane"" you are...\n\nBut I just laughed and said I\'ll stick to ""he/him"" and ""David"" 😔', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'I\'m 33 and I\'m 1 week into realising I\'m NB.

2020-07-14 16:01:29,hr46ag,20,6,"This actually happened awhile ago, but I’m starting to explore myself more now and now I’m kind of worried about this. (Also I’m still somewhat new to everything so please let me know if I’m using any terms wrong). I’m AFAB, and not even out to anyone as NB except one friend online. I’m mostly gendered as a female with strangers, but sometimes, if I haven’t spoken up yet or am talking softly I’ll be gendered male instead. Not very often, though. I never ‘correct’ anyone because I’m okay with whatever. 

A few months ago at my old workplace, I went to the back of the store to use the restrooms there. I went into the woman’s restroom, because I was (and still kind of am), using she/her, everyone knew me as such, and most people saw me as such upon a glance. It’s what I’ve always done. No issue (that I know of). But when I exited, there was a woman very frantically talking to her husband. She seemed middle aged. It’s been awhile, so I don’t remember exactly what she was saying, but she was distressed about “a guy being in the bathroom” and I think she was bouncing the idea of calling an employee to help. I didn’t look at her when I walked by, but after I did pass I heard her softly say “I didn’t realize that was a girl.” It was just... kind of weird for me. 

I’ve been questioning my identity (more like ignoring) for a long time, but recently I’ve decided I really do want to move forward with things. But that makes me wonder, if I start presenting more masc on purpose, which will probably lead to more middle aged ladies thinking I’m male, will this kind of thing happen more? I mean, I already try to avoid public restrooms because they’re gross...

2020-07-14 18:50:45,hr7e4s,4,1,"Which way have you chosen, and why? I wish that I could just live openly as NB, but it's not very easy due to the way the society works. Everywhere from official documents from dating apps there are only two options. For names, most are 99,5% either men's or women's names (and the rest are ""novelty"" names that SCREAM ""I'm special and different and a rebel""). Almost every person that sees you is going to in their head label you either a man or a woman. 

I can't find a way to ""make myself more NB"" without doing things that are not me. I don't want to cut my hair, or have a crazy haircut with ten different colors. I already wear almost exclusively men's clothes. I bind almost every time I go outside my apartment, except when I'm excercising. I never wear makeup. No one sees me as anything but a plain and boring-looking woman. 

I don't even see the point of ""identifying as non-binary"" if the only thing it affects is inside my own head. As long as I'm read as female (which is 100% of the time), in effect I am a woman regardless of if I like it or not.

——-


I’ve been having a hard time dealing with this and I am exhausted. If I don’t explain something coherently please let me know and I will try to do better. 

Some important background: I was raised in Puerto Rico in an independent fundamental baptist cult, specifically the Bob Jones University kind, so I was not only subjected to horrible teachings about gender roles from toddler age until my junior year of college, I was incredibly isolated from any other kinds of people, ideas, and ways of life. 

My earliest thoughts on gender started when I was eight and found myself wishing that there was something I could be other than a man or a woman. Something in-between. I think I might have been frustrated, as my little tomboy self usually was, over the unfairness of always having to wear skirts and dresses and having to put up with playing Princesses or Tea Party with my sisters instead of Knights and Dragons like I wanted to.

From the wife training classes I was made to take at 13, to always having my physical boundaries disrespected, to being taught that everything bad that happens in the world happens because a woman made a decision for herself, to watching independent women be called Jezebels, to having older men asking my father to “court” me (as a minor) and my parents seeing no issue with it aside from the fact they didn’t want me to “court” anybody regardless of age until halfway through Bible college, to being encouraged by my Bible college professors to adopt anti-feminist ideology, and not to mention the trauma from sexual abuse... It’s no wonder I’ve had issues with my femininity. 

Once I left Bible college and the cult and started educating myself on feminism, I started to feel much worse about myself. I hated my body. Seeing myself naked and being reminded that I have a “feminine” figure with breasts made me sick. Male attention made me uncomfortable. Seeing women sexualized in any and every context made me mad, despite being attracted to women myself. I still experience these things now but I’ve gotten a little better at stuffing them away. But no matter what I’ve done, the depersonalization and hatred of my body and the agony of being seen as a woman have continued to haunt me. 

I’ve cut my hair, I started binding and wearing men’s clothes, and for a while I told everyone I was genderfluid. It helped for a little bit but I then realized that my “dysphoria” wasn’t as bad as what real trans people go through and I stopped. There are also things about being a woman that I like now. I love having breasts in a sexual context, I love being feminine in the bedroom, I learned to love wearing dresses and makeup, and I really want to be a wife and mom someday. I feel like I couldn’t have these things if I was trans. Maybe that’s internalized transphobia, maybe not. I don’t know, and I don’t really care. Being trans isn’t an option for me. With the way that trans people are treated in our society, specifically non-binary trans people who choose not to undergo HRT or gender affirmation surgery, why would I make my life harder than it has to be?

But the feelings I’ve named “dysphoria” for so long still haven’t gone away. Women being sexualized or sexualizing themselves still makes me uncomfortable. Being referred to as a woman still seems fundamentally wrong to me. I still hate my body for the most part. I’ve never felt I belonged in groups of women and I don’t have any friends who are cis women. I can’t tell if these feelings are because I may still subconsciously believe that to be a woman is bad, or if I’m simply not a woman at all. And I don’t know how to find that out. 


I’m just tired of feeling this way. Has anyone else experienced this? Is this even gender dysphoria? How do I become comfortable in my womanhood? 

Thanks for reading this. Even if there’s no solid solution, it’s a relief to just vent and get this out here and see people’s responses to it.

CW/TW: Hate Crimes, Homophobia, Bullying, Gratuitous Violence, Gun Violence, Sexual Assault, Rape, Suicidal and Homicidal Ideation, Authoritarian Abuse, Military

To be perfectly honest with you, I didn’t even know what non-binary was until relatively recently. I’ve struggled with my gender identity for most of my life. I often confused it for sexuality, and at one point convinced myself to ignore the concept of gender completely, due in large part to society’s prescribed binary gender system.

I was about 10 years old when I first suspected I might not be a boy. But what other option was there? I didn’t feel like a girl either, and that left me pretty fuckin confused. I didn’t tell anyone about this, and I don’t \*think\* I changed my behavior in any way, but I think the local kids could “sense” something was off about me. Soon, everyone at school was calling me “gay” (everything was “gay” to these numbnuts). It started with mockery, then progressed into bullying, until one day…

They just started beating my ass. I stopped counting how many times I took a blind sucker punch in a hallway only to turn around and see every one of my fellow students pretending nothing had happened. I stopped counting how many times people would literally just walk up to my tray at lunch and simply take my food, to eat or sometimes just throw away. I gave up on any hope that my guidance counselor and principal would put a stop to it. This seemed to follow me to every school I went to, even when crossing state lines.

I spend most of my childhood years in fear or in pain, because of a concept I didn’t even understand. When I finally figured out what “gay” even meant, I was pretty sure it wasn’t me (spoiler alert, I was wrong). My feelings weren’t about who I wanted to have sex with, my feelings were about my place in a 2 gender system and how I didn’t feel comfortable with either option.

When I was 17, about a month before I joined the Army, I was smoking some dank ass kush with my friend Gabby, when I let it slip that I didn’t think I was a boy. Bless her heart, she too was blinded by the binary system, and automatically assumed I might be a girl. So she did what any supportive and stoned friend might do when discovering their friend is trans, and let me try on a bunch of her bras and underwear. We spent a couple hours in the mirror, trying on different sets and trying to see how I felt in them. Before I could properly explain what I was feeling, however, we ended up fucking in her underwear, and I forgot all about it for now.

About a month later, I joined the US Army. I was excited and happy to finally escape persecution for my “gay”. That relief was short lived. About 2 weeks into Basic, the other recruits started making fun of me too. It started with “innocent” little jokes about Don’t Ask/Don’t Tell, progressed into stealing my hygiene supplies, and then, as before, the sucker punches came. At this point I was familiar with the song and dance, and just resigned to it. I didn’t try to tell my drill sergeants. I didn’t try to explain myself to anyone. I just gave up.

5 or so weeks into Basic, I found out we’d be going to the live fire range for marksmanship reasons in about a week. Intrusive thoughts filled my mind. At first I was vengeful, I thought to myself “as soon as I get real bullets, I’m going to kill as many of these motherfuckers as I can before they kill me.” Then, I convinced myself that if I was so outnumbered, maybe I was the one who should die. I decided that as soon as I got out to the range, I’d turn my rifle on myself.

Needless to say, I chickened out. But what I \*did\* end up doing was shooting a 39/40, first time go. My drill sergeant made a comment at formation, “don’t fuck with \[DEADNAME\], dude can hit you from 300 meters away.” This earned me a little respect, and a week later, I earned an Expert badge from the grenade range, and again from the bayonet course. (When you have more than one, you just hang little bars that say “grenade” and “bayonet” from the badge, it looks sort of like a ladder and is honestly kinda cute). Apparently, you’re less likely to get beat up by your platoon if you’re “gay”, but really good at killing people.

They spared me for the rest of Basic Training and I got through AIT fine, because I wore my badges in Class A’s every Friday for inspection before we were allowed to enjoy our weekend. I kept my mouth shut, and I guess nobody wanted to fuck with me. I thought I was in the clear. Nobody cared that I was “gay”. I thought I finally beat the stigma, I did something good so the soldiers wouldn’t beat me up anymore. I did it.

So anyway, once I got to my first duty station the beatings resumed. Not nearly as often; where in school I was getting beaten nearly every day, now it only happened every 2 to 3 months. An improvement to be sure, but I never could shake the constant fear that someone in my company was just going to kick me in the nuts randomly, or smash my lunch in front of me, or whatever the fuck they had in mind. Again, I gave up, because I was “gay”. I stopped resisting. I just stuck to my duty the best I could, and didn’t make any friends. That was fine, until…

It was during my second deployment. I can’t bring myself to get into detail about it yet, except to say it’s literally my most vivid memory. Long story short, I was gang raped in the motor pool with a grimy, oily broom handle because I was “gay”. The only person I told this to before today was the worker investigating my PTSD claim for disability benefits.

Those guys made it onto my personal “DNR” list. I was a medic, you see, and there were 4 total people who I decided I wouldn’t try hard enough to save if they ended up wounded. I would make it look like I tried, or pretend they were low on my triage list. None of these 4 ever got wounded, and in retrospect, I don’t think I would have been able to kill them if they had.

Anyway in 2012, I let my contract expire, and ETS’d. I receded into a hole for about 3 or 4 years, and completely ignored my gender identity. It was only a few short years ago that I was introduced to the concept of “non-binary people”. What a godsend that was! I finally felt like I had a place in society! I had a name! I wasn’t “gay” (yes I was), I was non-binary! But now there was a new problem.

Non-binary is kind of vague, you see. It covers a LOT of ground. All it really means is “not a man, not a woman”, and you I felt like I needed to narrow it down from there. I’m still stuck in this stage to be honest. Besides, I’m a little behind the curve in my understanding of the concept of gender at all. I need to decide whether my outward gender expression, or if my place in society is more important to me. If my outward expression is more important (and it might be because lol ego), then I am genderqueer. If my place in society is more important, then I am genderfluid.

For the first time in my life, I feel comfortable enough to pursue my feelings about my gender, to narrow it down, to put a name to the face, as it were.

Again, I gave up, because I was “gay”. I stopped resisting. I just stuck to my duty the best I could, and didn’t make any friends. That was fine, until…\n\nIt was during my second deployment. I can’t bring myself to get into detail about it yet, except to say it’s literally my most vivid memory. Long story short, I was gang raped in the motor pool with a grimy, oily broom handle because I was “gay”. The only person I told this to before today was the worker investigating my PTSD claim for disability benefits.\n\nThose guys made it onto my personal “DNR” list. I was a medic, you see, and there were 4 total people who I decided I wouldn’t try hard enough to save if they ended up wounded. I would make it look like I tried, or pretend they were low on my triage list. None of these 4 ever got wounded, and in retrospect, I don’t think I would have been able to kill them if they had.\n\nAnyway in 2012, I let my contract expire, and ETS’d. I receded into a hole for about 3 or 4 years, and completely ignored my gender identity. It was only a few short years ago that I was introduced to the concept of “non-binary people”. What a godsend that was! I finally felt like I had a place in society! I had a name! I wasn’t “gay” (yes I was), I was non-binary! But now there was a new problem.\n\nNon-binary is kind of vague, you see. It covers a LOT of ground. All it really means is “not a man, not a woman”, and you I felt like I needed to narrow it down from there. I’m still stuck in this stage to be honest. Besides, I’m a little behind the curve in my understanding of the concept of gender at all. I need to decide whether my outward gender expression, or if my place in society is more important to me. If my outward expression is more important (and it might be because lol ego), then I am genderqueer. If my place in society is more important, then I am genderfluid.\n\nFor the first time in my life, I feel comfortable enough to pursue my feelings about my gender, to narrow it down, to put a name to the face, as it were. I am non-binary, and I exist despite every effort to prevent me from doing so.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': ""Happy Non-Binary People's Day! (CW/TW)"", 'created': 1594788796.0}"

Hi everyone. So I’m AFAB and 18. I was brutally sexually abused from 4-10 and then had separated instances of sexual assault occur after. Because of this, I grew to loathe myself. I developed a serious ED at the age of 8, and I despised my body.

Recently, I’ve been questioning whether or not I may not even be fully female; part of me is wondering if I’m non-binary. I’d say my connection to womanhood is something I feel proud of (probably in part because I’ve identified as a lesbian since the age of 14) and have been proud of for my entire life, but sometimes when someone refers to me as “she”, it doesn’t feel right. I can comfortably say that I feel female 85-90% of the time, but the other 10-15%...????

I go by Alex and use they/them she/her 

I recently realised I was neither male or female but looking back I definitely see some things I said/did that make sense now.
I kinda had an idea I wasn’t a female ages ago but as I didn’t want to be a trans man I was stuck in how I could identify (no clue this label existed lol)

I cried whenever I was forced to be girly and look super “nice” (nice to my parents was a pretty dress) dressing “nice” made me incredibly uncomfortable.
I had family and friends tell me to wear dresses and skirts and when I would refuse they would say things like “oh you will regret this when you are older” “when you are in your 20s you will be in dresses and be wearing makeup” “are you sure you don’t want to wear this dress” “what about this lipstick”
(actual quotes by my family friends and family) 

I told my auntie I never wanted to wear makeup and her response was “you just haven’t found the right makeup yet” 
This auntie also got mad that my mum let me wear jeans and a nice top to a restaurant because she wanted to see me in a dress. (She actually brought me a dress in hopes my mum would force me to wear it) 
Thanks mum for not being a dick 😃😃


I hated being called a girly girl and always wanted to hang with the boys and be a tomboy.
I stopped wearing a bra because it made my boobs look to big and I hated it.

My friend came out to me as non binary à few months ago and it really triggered an identity crisis for me and à big réflexion on my gender. I kinda came to the conclusion that I was probably non binary but would rather not talk about it or tell people cause I'm still comfortable with the she/her pronouns and don't care enough about gender to make a fuss about it and make it a conversation with people. I just do whatever I want and it's cool. 

But last night, my boyfriend came out to me and I felt elated. Like my heart was beating so fast, I couldn't stop smiling, I was super excited... And I felt inappropriately happy, as if the relief I felt for them was the relief i felt when I came out (I'm pan btw). I felt nauseaus all night and couldn't sleep because I was so happy and this morning I talked to a friend that made me réalise that maybe I care more about gender than i thought and could consider coming out, at least to myself or something.

My problem is, I feel like I can't because I'd be stealing my partners identity. I don't want them to think I'm trying to copy them or anything.

Hey all! I need some help.

2.5 years ago, my fiance and I had our daughter. At that point, I still identified as cisgendered. I never really *liked* how my body changed but I also didn't mind, as it made me feel motherly.

About a month ago, I realized I'm non binary, which is neato burrito, but my body is now a huge source of gender dysphoria. I never realized how much I'd love to have top surgery until recently, and because my chest got so much larger from being pregnant, it's made me kinda hate them? And on the other side of things, my hips also got a lot bigger, and before that, I was always quite a twig.

So, I just got my prescription for T (yay!) and finasteride. At my appointment I deferred to my doctor in terms of what a good starter low dose would be, but now I'm having doubts. She knows I'm nonbinary, and that I wanted a low dose, and she prescribed 50mg/week of sub-q injections. 

Now, I am taking finasteride too, so maybe that was part of her calculation, but I've also seen studies that sub-q injections require 25% of the dosage of IM injections to achieve similar effects so...

I know 50mg/week would be on the low end for a trans man, and I've seen that other nonbinary people are on 25mg/week, but of course every body is different.

I haven't made a pronoun switch yet really, but I want to try out they/them because I think those pronouns better align with how I feel about gender (I don't feel connected to gender at all and I don't really identify with any gender).

Since starting the hormones they have been more moody and their body acne is out of control. I have tried to bring this up but it starts a huge fight.

2020-07-17 12:59:38,hsv911,64,1,"So I've seen some push from the LGBT community against the nonbinary and trans community recently. Including jokes about how ridiculous it is that there are 50+ genders.

The problem in my opinion is the concept of genders. Society has said that sex has a mental element called gender and if you fall into 1 gender you have to act, like and present a certain way. If you fall into the other gender the same thing.

We as humans want to feel like we belong so we are very adamant in finding labels that match our feelings. That way we can explain to people why we are different than what society says.

But I have a novel concept, let's get rid of genders and let people be and express themselves how they see fit? Keep the concept of sex around but that can be changed obviously.

I think this would push for a better world for our communities. I think less people will feel pressured to transition of they can be happy expressing themselves. I only say this because I know transitioning is very tough and expensive and not always solution for someone. Partial transitioning will be more acceptable where someone takes T or E to adjust their body to their liking.

That is part of my motive to be honest. I want to bend and destroy gender binaries and shoe the world that someone like me exists and is proud. Someone who has become successful in life and spends much of their time helping others and charities. That a guy who wears a dress is not confused or mentally ill.

Most of the time it was just that I could not, under any circumstances wear a type of clothing or get a certain haircut. Small things.

It has become so much bigger. So much bigger.

Now it manifests as increased levels of stress and lower cognitive functions. I have had stress problems for years, but this has made it so much worse. I have never had strong mental health, not ever. But when people misgender me (I'm out of the closet, and have been for 2 months. Not ONCE has anybody correctly gendered me), or, like my grandma, blatantly just says that she doesn't think I am who I am, It kind of drains a mental health battery, in a way. I have a certain amount of bullsh*t that I can put up with before I break.

3 days ago, I broke. I was unable to be in social environments (with my family) for more than 20 minutes without getting into a screaming match, my usually decent ability to pick up on social cues was gone, and so was my ability to think critically or rationally about anything.

It got so bad that I was having trouble speaking. Not trouble speaking full sentences, trouble speaking whole words.

This only ended when I had a talk with my therapist and with one really understanding family member, my step dad, who has been super supportive the whole time (still hasn't gendered me correctly, but I know that he's trying. I can see him curse himself when he gets it wrong).

With no euphoria coming from anywhere, and my dysphoria spiking everywhere, what should be my favorite time of the year is now the worst time in my life.

I do not know what to do. I am a minor, I have no money, I cannot buy things. I'm not allowed to have long hair. I cannot wear women's clothes (family says).

I have been more than stretched to the breaking point. I've broken.

It feels like the 7th circle of hell in Dante's Inferno, where people run around and have their organs feasted on by harpies, only to have to regrow them and have to have them eaten again.

Oh, did I mention the 7th circle? The wood of the suicides? That's fitting, because now I'm having drastically increased rates of suicidal thoughts.

2020-07-17 18:37:34,ht177r,18,1,"Hey, guys!

So, I recently came out as nonbinary, but I realized in doing so that I am not terribly uncomfortable being “sexed” as female, which is my biological sex.  I was having a discussion with another nonbinary friend of mine, who said that they didn’t like that at all.

It’s interesting.  I am okay being seen as “female”, because biologically I am.  I am not okay being considered a woman, or a girl, though.  I don’t consider myself particularly femme, or gender fluid or anything, I just have peace with my body.  I am comfortable in it, and it’s taken me through a lot.  It helped me birth my daughter (giving me more feminine hips than I had before), and nurse her (giving me more pronounced breasts), and is my soul’s little home.  I guess I don’t want to disrespect it by denying what it is, and what it’s been through.  

From an early age, though, I determined not to be defined by my body.  My mom could never leave the house without makeup, and I told myself I would never be that way.  Sometimes I still enjoy some lipstick, or cover-up to hide pimples, but I don’t *need* it (which makes more sense knowing I’m nonbinary).  I wonder if this is why I don’t struggle a ton with dysphoria - because I see my body as separate from my personhood.  

Sometimes I feel like this makes me nonbinary, but I have always been more comfortable when not presenting as female.  I don’t stress about hiding my anatomy, but I shave my head, generally avoid makeup (with rare exceptions, as stated above), and don’t wear a ton of dresses.  I’m also attracted to people who defy gender roles.  Men with long hair/crop tops/short shorts, women with short hair, masc clothing, strong arms - and, of course, all of you lovely enby folk!

I also don’t want to bother correcting people when I am labeled as “she/her”.  I love my gender-neutral pronouns, and honestly prefer them, but socially it is “easier” to go with she/her.  I don’t want people to feel bad when correcting them, because it doesn’t matter to me a ton.  I also don’t feel the need to make my mom stop calling me her daughter, or to make my child call me her “parent” instead of mom.  I don’t feel attached to womanhood, but my body carried her and my breasts fed her, so I’ve fulfilled the role of “motherhood” on a base level.  

Sorry for the rant, I was just hoping to start a discussion on sex vs. gender, and whether or not other people feel fine with their sex.

2020-07-17 20:26:58,ht37v5,0,1,"Hi, I am afab and in my early 20s. I have recently started questioning this month since I learned a lot more about what it means to be nonbinary. I remember that when I was very very young, I was often switching out my girly clothes for my cousin's boy clothes (pink, sparkly shirts for sports jerseys). My favorite color had always been blue/dark blue. I loved both male and female characters on TV but asked my mom to call me by different male character names. My mom grew up also being called a tomboy so she supported it. In middle school, I had always gravitated towards male-dominated sports like football, baseball, wrestling, boxing, and skateboarding, which I did play on my own for fun but my dad officially enrolled me in volleyball. I remember that in my French class, we had to pick our own French name and I went with Adrienne, I think because it sounded male but was written in a way that could be identified as female? I was always called a tomboy because I preferred to wear sneakers and sports clothes to school, or when I used to go to church it was usually buttondowns and pants. I remember my dad sometimes asking me to dress like a girl and that always bothered me. I have a sister and a mom who are both very feminine and I never felt comfortable dressing like them or looking like them, which I think is why my dad said that.

Towards the end of HS, I started learning salsa dance, which typically upholds the binary (there are leads and follows and usually guys were leads and ladies were follows). I think this is where I felt that I constantly had to fight to show how feminine I was, because my body is athletic and not very curvy, and I was shy/uncomfortable to ""act"" feminine. My dance director would say, ""You must be a tomboy."" I was a follow but I always felt like I preferred to dance in the lead style, or that I didn't feel that I could express my style fully as a follow. However, dance helped me become more in tune and proud of my femininity. Still, I often preferred to choreograph in styles that weren't necessarily feminine but that showed strong women that could dance in the male style too.

I feel comfortable when being called a female/she/her and with calling myself female. But in my ideal world, I wouldn't want to be called or seen as any gender. However, I don't know if that's simply because I don't like gender roles or that I may be nonbinary. Some days I like to wear dresses and wear makeup, and other days I like to wear clothes deemed as male. I'm not sure if I'm just a tomboy, or maybe a demigirl or nonbinary.

I’ve reminded both my partner and my family and still, nothing. \n\nI just feel lost and alone, I have no friends that I can talk to about this, pfft I have no friends at all let’s not lie lol.

I'm looking into ways to experiment with natural estrogens to see if it feels better emotionally, more affirming, etc. I'll preface this by saying it's in no way meant to be a precursor or substitute for medical hormone treatment or GCS (I'm just beautifully vaguely nonbinary!).

I want to experience emotions a little differently, but not interfere with my current sexual experiences which involve erections.

2020-07-18 01:24:02,ht84fe,4,1,"Hi Y'all, I hope you are having a nice day/night/what-have-you.

So uh, I kinda need a little help making sense of all this. A lit bit of background on myself:

So I'm 23 (almost 24 somehow....) years old and I am/thought I was a trans girl. For the longest time I've hated being called a guy and stuff, and eventually when I found out that like hey, being a different gender than the one you were assigned at birth was an actual thing I was like ""Holy shit that's me, I'm a girl""... but now I'm not so sure anymore. I kinda do feel like a girl on some level, but labelling myself *just* a girl feels like stuffing myself into yet another box. 

I'm okay referring to myself as a girl though, it doesn't really feel that weird, other than the fact that mentally every time I call myself a girl I'm like ""I guess?"" or ""Whatever that means"".

I've been transitioning for a little under a year, I've already changed my name and everything, and I've been able to live as a girl, which is nice... But now I'm kinda realising that I don't really now if that label fits. The thing is, it just feels more freeing to live as a girl?, I can pretty much do whatever with my presentation for instance, without really worrying about dealing with being judged too much, but other than that I don't really feel that much of a connection to womanhood.

I hate being seen as male, or a guy or whatever masculine terms, I get really bad dysphoria about it. I also get dysphoric about certain characteristics that my brain associates as ""male"", so in that regard medically transitioning has been nice, and I like what hormones have done to my body and my mental state.

But here's the thing though, I don't really like being seen as a woman. Girl/gal are fine, but when it comes to other terms like woman or female it's just... ugh, kinda makes my skin crawl a little. I don't really feel dysphoric about it, but is just like being stuffed into yet another box that doesn't really feel like it fits, and although this box doesn't make me feel awful like the other one did, it's also not really comfortable either.

I can refer to myself as a woman if the situation calls for it I guess, but I pretty much always have like 2 seconds of brain lag (that is, I have to mentally prepare myself and it doesn't really feel natural) to deal with when I have to call myself that haha. Come to think of it, the same thing happens with feminine pronouns when I have to use them (which is a lot of the time, because Spanish) though not as often as with ""woman"".
Side note: I've actually gotten pretty good at avoiding gendering myself that much in Spanish, though sometimes it's necessary to do so because otherwise you really have to go out of your way to avoid any gendering, and it just sounds awkward.


As far as pronouns go, he/him are hell, she/her are fine and don't really bother me much, although they can get a little bit grating on occasion, and in those moments I get really annoyed at how gendered everything is (specially when your native language is Spanish and even freaking tables are gendered) and I just wanna scream and be like ""UGH just call me a person, screw this man or woman crap"". 
They/Them are great to be honest, don't really know why anyone wouldn't like these... too bad there's no Spanish equivalent and I have to deal with this bs language every day outside of the Internet...



So yeah... I don't really know anymore and I could really use some help, so like if any of this made any sense to any of you, please let me know.

Thanks for reading that long-ass rant!, I hope you keep having a nice day/night/whatever.

- increased irritability (perhaps simply due to our current world.. lol)
- slimmer hips (maybe. Hard to tell.)

I believe it's mostly no changes right now. But I'll keep posting updates. I'm debating upping to 25 mg in early August but I may wait as I'm not looking to become super man lol.

Other low dose T peeps, what's your experience been?

Any questions feel free to ask!

I think I am genderqueer of some sort, but as for anything more specific, I cannot say anything definitively. My feelings/attitudes are not static at all, some things change day to day, and I worry that if I tell anybody about it now, it'll go away in the future and I'll look dumb like I've pretending this whole time, or I'll have wasted a big part of my life not being who I am. 

In every way, it feels like being cis would be so much easier in every daily situation, but I just can't fucking stop the internal cycle. Sometimes I feel like I could be okay living as a cis woman, so then I ask myself ""Why don't I just choose to be a woman to make this go away, if it's a matter of choice?"" but then when I imagine doing that, it feels like I would be repressing a huge part of myself. Then after a while when I finally accept that I'm genderqueer, and I prepare myself for adversity and get ready to just have fun and do what feels right, I go online and see all these new things that knock me backwards again, or my brain tells me all these different things, and the cycle repeats.

I have always been uncomfortable with many social/biological aspects of being a woman throughout my life, but then it leads to the question of ""What is being a woman?"" is it based on expectations? Is it based on science? Is it based on an innate inner feeling? Would I feel like this if I was raised in a different culture?

I am wondering what nonbinary 'feels like'. In terms of clothing I dress both androgynous and feminine. I like my breasts some days but for many years I wanted a breast reduction as I felt a much flatter chest would feel more 'me'. Now I have embraced my breasts but still admire a flatter chest and often feel jealous of my boyfriend flat chest.

The main thing is that I fantasise about having a penis all the time. Wearing a strap on in every day life appeals to me, and I would love the ones that you can urinate through. I enjoy fantasy dick play with my bf and my biggest turn on is imagining I have one. I also like having a vagina though.

There are 2 problems here:\n1) Name change: I want to be able to put my preferred name on things and eventually legally change my name, but it feels REALLY WEIRD to just write Oliver Oliver on something formal\n2) My family: I'm already struggling with coming out to my parents and extended family, and getting them to use a preferred name is gonna be difficult enough without it being THEIR LAST NAME.\n\nAny advice is appreciated, tysm! &lt;3"", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'My preferred name is my last name?', 'created': 1595131404.0}"

2020-07-18 23:29:58,htqi5v,0,3,"I was born in 1995, assigned female at birth, and named Kathryn. I've had issues regarding gender for my entire life. 

As a little kid, I despised wearing dresses and skirts, and chose and desired toys targeted towards boys more often than dolls and barbies or other toys designed for girls. I was definitely more of a tomboy, and spent more of my time hanging out with boys than other girls my age. Back then, I didn't even realize that females and males were anatomically different, and remember insisting that I was physically equal to boys. 

As I got older I preferred sports over fashion, still spent most of my time with guys, and loved competing physically and getting dirty. Eventually as I began puberty I felt highly uncomfortable with the changes my body was going through, hating that my breasts were starting to develop, despising my body shape and my high-pitched voice. 

I have two older sisters who are extremely feminine, and I remember my confusion when I realized I was nothing like them and didn't seem to have any of the same interests as they did. 

Around this time I started watching female-to-male transition videos on YouTube. However, also during this period of my life, I was homeschooled and completely socially isolated. My sisters were much older than me and had moved out, leaving me alone with mentally-abusive parents. My dad began grooming me to be his personal assistant for my entire life, and I dropped out of school at age 15 to begin working for him full-time. I began self-harming, and due to the pressures of my day to day life becoming so overwhelming and demanding, issues regarding my personal identity (including my gender) were swept under the rug, and the matter was pushed from my mind for several years, however I always had this distinct and uncomfortable feeling that something was wrong. 

In my later teenage years I rediscovered female-to-male transition videos on YouTube, and as I watched I realized I had seen several in the past before I had stopped paying attention to myself. I had so much excitement and joy watching these people become who they truly felt they were and realizing the same could be possible for me, and I didn't need to feel stuck and lost hating my identity forever. At the same time, I was in denial that I could possibly be trans and didn't consider transitioning to be a realistic possibility for me. 

Finally when I was 21, I began exploring my identity more deeply and realizing that was what I wanted to do. I asked several different sources whether I could be transgender and generally got the same response; that I seemed to be experiencing gender dysphoria, and cisgender people usually don't go through such or wish they were the opposite sex, and since I put so much time and effort into questioning it, I more likely than not was. 

It was then that I came out to my parents, cut my hair short and began wearing a chest binder and clothes made for men, and transitioned socially, going by the name Ryan. The change was astronomical; I felt so much more comfortable being perceived as male than I had as female, I no longer felt trapped in my own identity. 

When I was 23 I got my first real job, and my coworkers all called me Ryan and used male pronouns for me. Though I hadn't begun medically transitioning, most people generally didn't question my gender and just assumed I was a short guy and with a slightly high voice. 

Two months later in February 2019, my mom passed away unexpectedly and my life has basically been going downhill from there. Since I've always had a toxic relationship with my dad, he kicked me out shortly thereafter and I moved into one of my coworkers sister's house. I quickly bonded with their mother, who unfortunately is a drug addict. I began making several friends in their moms circle who also were addicts, and soon began using as well. 

Several of my new friends informed me that they had known a ""real"" trans man and they didn't think I was transgender at all. My coworkers mom came up with a theory that I hated Kathryn so much that the only reason I was trying to become Ryan was basically to destroy my old self. 

As a result of my addiction I ended up getting sexually assaulted and raped by several men. I'm now living in a homeless shelter that's heavily divided by gender, and as I haven't taken any steps to legally or medically transition yet, I've been living on the women's side. After my experiences, I feel much more comfortable and safe here than I think I would on the men's side. However, I still experience gender dysphoria and confusion. I've been going by Kat instead of Ryan and now identify as non-binary instead of female-to-male. But I genuinely miss being called Ryan and using male pronouns and being viewed as a guy.

2020-07-19 01:59:35,htsncf,0,1,"Title sums it up. I'm going to try to lay out everything here, so please forgive me if this gets long and a little tmi, I'm trying to be detailed without being explicit.

Lets start in the beginning. I am AMAB, but ever since I was a little kid, we are talking as young as 5, I was fascinated by gender bendering (such as that one Fairly Odd Parents Episode). I had the occasional dream about changing genders, the earliest I can recall was at 6 or 7. Around 12 I started watching mtf makeup transformation videos. I thought I ws getting in trouble when I was caught watching them, but in hindsight I think my parents were trying to discern my feelings on such things. Predictably, I gave them little.

At 12ish I began occasional crossdressing in my moms stuff when home alone. I did not get a sexual thrill from it, I just enjoyed it. I do not know if it was because it was taboo, or because of what it was. I eventually stopped after trying on a friends short-shorts at a pool party. Got caught, then was taught the birds and the bees (in hindsight, I think my parents thought something more explicit was occurring there). I did try on my cousins stuff a few times, and it felt like an enjoyable action.

I discovered self-pleasuring at 13, and began doing so almost exclusively to gender bending and feminization content. This remains true to today. As I matured, I slowly began hating 3 things about myself: my weight (entirely my fault there, and still is. I like food and I like eating), my deep voice (singing any popular song in the last 10 years is not easy with a voice as deep as mine. It's also not a great sounding one anyway), and my build. I'm literally 2 feet across at the shoulders. That's not hyperbolyMy whole torso is a box. And so any clothing looks poor on me, let alone feminine ones, which I sometimes daydreamed about getting.

I'd day dream throughout high school, and from time to time, it would be about wearing feminine clothes or makeup. As time went on, and I matured sexually, I realized I was bi, and primarily attracted to feminine guys. Then comes college.

Three things occurred: I a) bought a piece of feminine undergarment, and b) began having such dreams again, though rarely. One sticks out as two people, both of whom are me, but don't look like me, seemed to be debating my gender. One for boy and other for girl. I can't recall the ending, but I think it was either resolved on boy, or no resolution was found. and c) I became increasing interested in methods that could alter my appearance without spending my money too much.

Then comes this virus. I am home, not on campus, and over the last month and a half, 2 months, dreams about gender bending or dressing as the opposite sex, it is hard to tell on account of not looking at my nethers, have been significantly increasing in frequency. I've had several back to back, but on average its now once a week at least. I enjoy these a lot, and are often sad when they end. There increase, however, also coincides with making a friend who is a crossdresser/femboy, and discussing some of my experiences with him. So I have no idea if it was just cause it was in my mind to cause a dream, and then having such a dream has spawned more as I think about them.

Additionally, I notice that when I look at women around my age, it is often with as much jealousy as admiration, usually at their clothing and way of acting. Like I want to be wearing that, or be able to wear that and look good in it.

Overall, I'm trying to sort these feelings out. I'm I just turned on by such things (thinking about crossdressing or any of this usually excites downstairs, though not always) and are conflating a fetish to something bigger. I'm a projecting my desired partner onto myself, or vice versa, my desired self onto a partner? I'm rather fond of my buddy downstairs and its function, and I am content with my pronouns, but... I feel like I'd be happier if I present more femininely. Feminine clothing, mannerisms, and a lighter voice. But then I wonder if its a desire to just be skinny (or as skinny as my build can healthily permit) being combined with a fetish or desired type of partner, and a general want to be seen as cute, not handsome or manly. So I'm doubting myself, and doubting my doubts, and it is just becomes a circle.

So I think that is everything, and I know no one can come to a conclusion but me, but some help on what this may be could be nice. And I also know professional help would likely help, and I intend to get some soon, before the end of the week. Interestingly, the thought doesn't fill me with anxious excitement, like something like this usually would, but an anticipation excitement.

2020-07-19 04:58:44,htv189,2,2,"TW: Just general heavy issues as a whole

In the last couple years, I have been dealing with alot of dysphoria and heavily explored my gender identity. I went from genderfluid in 2018 to Demigirl in 2019. For a bit, demigirl seemed to make so much sense, and felt so right; even though neo-pronouns were still an odd concept to me, I had become invested in the possibility pf being Demigirl that I was considering using Shey/Sheir/Shem pronouns. 

I even had a deep discussion with my ex about the possibility of surgery (I have since discarded the idea of this, however, I know now it is not feasible for me due to a few reasons) but he was very phobic about it and against the idea of being a ""genderless alien"" (my mom, bless her heart, she tried to understand all this new information but was just as against it). That disheartening experience plus new awareness of having top and bottom dysphoria eventually compounded into a hellish Halloween night where I... gave into self-pleasure (yet again...); a war from within that I've been fighting for roughly four years now due to stupid decisions. 

I'm apothisexual and erotophobic, mind you, so after losing the battle that night for what seemed like the millionth time, I broke down and cried on the bathroom floor continuously saying ""This is not my body!""; and I thought that one time I puked afterwards was bad... That morning, a family friend who is a therapist confirmed that I've had DPDR (which we've discovered that I've actually had since birth; this is a disorder usually born of abuse and this made it worse). 

This disorder messes with my reality and identity constantly. The moment - I truly mean the moment - that I made the connection as to why I felt this way was due to this thing, all my dysphoric thoughts just went away. I stopped feeling uncomfortable about being referred to as female, I no longer corrected anyone that I was non-binary, for the first time in my life, I felt okay and at peace because everything fell into place and it all made sense. Fast forward to the last week or so where I've been haunted by a memory involving a friend who (as I found out) saved an image of my fursona (whose reference sheet I had shown to him in the past) but cropped her torso (refer to image 1 in the link at the bottom of this post) and then he sent me his reaction (refer to image 2)... 

I didn't berate him properly because I was so disgusted and disturbed by this violation of the extension of my person... At the time, it made me wish I could do something about it but it was only until recently that I decided that as much as I adore the artist's SFW style and how my fursona looked visually, I realized that I never properly communicated what I wanted my fursona to actually look like in order to make me feel comfortable (it was my first ever commission transaction) and now I want to change her design to appropriately match how I feel three years later (as of the finished product). 

I guess my dysphoria never truly went away because I'm still willing to get rid of my breasts if it were for a medical reason (such as breast cancer or something). That said, in trying to figure out if it was possible to have a female yet genderless character, my other friend helped me realize what body type I wanted was androgynous and linked an example (refer to image 3). I literally teared up looking at that image because that looked very much like what I wish my body looked like. However, I'm still on the fence on if the character has wide hips, giving them a large rear, or just thick thighs (I am also dysphoric about large rear ends and intergluteal clefts; this experience has taught me that I like the hourglass, lightly toned figure but not at the expense of the attention that it brought upon itself with the friend with the cropped image). 

Despite that, it gave me comfort that a newly designed fursona could finally represent the me I felt on the inside, where other means would not be possible. With all of this in mind, I question my identity again. I know that something outside of myself has caused this, that years of abuse and exposure to society's ideals of the female body have dumped dysphoria on me. But is it a gender dysphoria or just body dysphoria? Am I back to seeing myself as a Demigirl or do I simply just want to escape myself so much that I no longer want to see myself as a stranger due to DPDR? What am I, really? I'm trying to pray to God to help me though this rough patch, and I guess in a way, this is one way of talking to Him because I cannot formulate words in the conventional manner... Anyway, I'm sorry if this tangent makes little sense, I just needed to get it all out of my troubled mind... Thank you for listening.

2020-07-19 05:30:49,htveil,4,8,"This might get a little long I just don't know what I feel and it's honestly so difficult for me to figure out. 

Start off I am afab and also moved out so I'm safe in that regard. I have pretty amazing parents in the sense that even though it was rocky at first they accept and love me for being a lesbian. But I've had some real issues in the past with my parents. Not to get into past trauma but basically being called a ""drama queen"" or ""attention seeker"" was quite common for my mom to call me. I never felt this way and I never wanted attention on me? I have been a shut in since I was young, I hate attention. With my childhood and my mom and I's relationship I have an issue being able to tell if I'm actually feeling something? Like it's hard to discern whether I am feeling for me or feeling for/against her. 

One of the biggest reasons I am having issues is that back when I was 16 (21 now) I thought I was ftm trans and I came out to them. My dad was fine with it but my mom basically ended up telling at me that if I was she would have known so I stopped wearing my masculine clothes and kinda slammed down the button of femininity. So it's really hard for me to think about gender and I shoved it down for 5 years and having a girlfriend who is an enby and multiple supportive friends I have been able to feel for the first time in a long time. 

One more big aspect, I have always hated my chest, I ""developed"" early on in life, and I have always hated them. Everyone knows this, but when I was a preteen and trying to be like all the other kids I started to dress we will say ""less conservative?"" And I was showing off cleavage and all of that, then I went back to hating my chest when I realized the attention I was getting was not wanted nor did I feel any better about flaunting myself. Basically I have always wanted my chest to be flat. And I guess that is a dysphoria in itself. 

Now my issue is, I have talked to my support systems and they all say the same thing of constantly thinking about gender and wishing things were different isn't something a cis person would generally do? So I want to believe that I just know I have disconnected my feelings in such a way that I can't feel what I am?? I'm a bit uncomfortable when people refer to me as girl or she/her but I always equated that to what I believed was just internalized sexism. I feel like a fake, a fraud, like I am attention seeking and in 5 months I will be back to being cis. I will never like my chest and I have wanted top surgery since I found out you could get it (13/14) I don't experience bottom dysphoria, but I wish I could be more masculine. 

I am sorry this is a lot of rambles and I don't know if I'm coherent. But basically:

TLDR: If I constantly want to be something different from how I am perceived, am I just doing it so I can be a ""special snowflake""? And how do I know if I'm not just faking it?

And also any advice on how to talk to parents would be wonderful, because I really need my mom's support through this and I don't want it to happen like last time.

A little backstory: I live in Portland, Oregon, am 24 y/o and live with my ma (72 y/o). Moved back because of covid. She is very liberal and so am I. 

However, I have recently started being realllly conscious about using they/them pronouns for people. To break bad habits I have started using they/them for everyone unless they tell me otherwise. 

She hates this and insists that they/them is for multiple people. I have told her to build a bridge and get over it, she lives in Portland and should be used to hearing it. It’s gotten so bad we fight about it a lot. She calls me rude and immature and I say the same thing back. 

Any ideas or advice?? 

Thanks!

Recently, I've been questioning whether or not I am a woman. I always felt this confusion for like two days last September but now I'm thinking about it more. For reference, I'm in the middle of some rlly shitty mental health issues that result in feeling dissociative and have recently experienced some sexual trauma so I think this may have something to do with it??? Idk. I feel very comfortable with my body and at times actually wish I looked more feminine, but I keep having days where wearing feminine clothing and calling myself a woman have made me feel anxious and it feels like my body is not my own. These are also days where I'm more down. I'm comfortable with feminine pet names ""my girl"" ""pretty girl"" ""sweet girl"" etc., but in my last relationship, however, I felt extremely uncomfortable because I felt hyperfeminized by my partner. I felt like he was always reminding me that I'm a girl and it made me feel uncomfortable. I've been considering asking my friends to use she/they pronouns with me, but the idea of being nonbinary also gives me a lot of anxiety. Like doing research and trying to figure this out has been making me feel nauseous, etc and it's been stressful for me. I've also been heavily questioning my sexuality lately. I know I like women but idk if I'm a lesbian or bi, and trying to figure out if I'm gay does not make me feel anxious the way trying to figure out if I'm nonbinary does. Of course nobody is obligated to guide me through this, but I'm wondering if anyone had a similar experience while figuring out their gender???


ADDITION: The only times I can think of from my childhood that have not said ""you're one hundred percent cisgender"" are that (I'm a theatre kid, sorry) I always wanted to play male roles.

2020-07-20 09:15:33,hui6wn,4,7,"TW: Gender Dysphoria

Hi! I’m non-binary and only in the past couple of months have I realised this.

Some days, I get chest dysphoria and other days, I’m fine.. well I’m not fine but like.. it’s bearable. My mum’s a nurse and she would kill me for wearing a binder so I try my best not to wear it when she’s around (I’m moving out soon so this won’t be a problem much longer).

But sometimes, certain things will trigger my dysphoria more. Sometimes I’m feeling more masculine which is understandable but sometimes it’s certain outfits that will trigger it??? I don’t know if anyone else has ever experienced that. Like I put on certain outfits and I get really weird about my chest I almost feel tingly around there like I just want to claw at my chest until it’s flat. I’ve gone out before and then chest dysphoria hits me and I end up having my arms up around my chest, pressing down super hard until I get home.

I remember growing up and having certain songs, people or situations trigger (what I didn’t know then was) social dysphoria and I’d try and dress as masculine/androgynous as possible to fit that.

**I 100% respect every person's gender identity, binary or not, and their right to be referred to by the pronouns that align with that identity. In an effort to support folks who care deeply about their pronouns, I try to state my own during introductions, on nametags, etc.**

**However, here's my dark secret: I'm not sure I believe that everyone should have to care about their own pronouns, or to prefer certain pronouns over others. I believe gender is a social construct, and in my ideal world, there would probably not be any gendered pronouns (although I welcome criticism if that view is problematic).** In my case, I have been referred to with ""he/him"" pronouns for my entire life, and I have never felt viscerally offended by that, because I tend to present as male and feel fine presenting as such, and because I have been socially conditioned to believe those are the correct pronouns for me. However, I don't feel any personal attachment to ""he/him"" pronouns, nor to the male gender. In fact, I pretty much despise men as compared to women, due to the misogyny and machismo I have come to associate men with. I feel I have many stereotypically feminine personality traits, and I generally believe women tend to be better people than men. Still, I've never felt a natural desire for anyone to call me by ""she/her"" (or ""they/them,"" for that matter) pronouns, nor a desire to present as femme, etc. I identify more with cis-male than with any other gender identity, but I feel that is almost purely the result of my social conditioning, and I don't like to go around reinforcing or reifying that problematic social conditioning by asking people to call me by ""he/him"" pronouns.

**The truth is that I don't care what pronouns I'm called by. I would conceptually prefer ""they/them"" over anyone else, but that's really just because ultimately I would prefer that ""they/them"" (or some gender-neutral pronouns) be used for all human beings. However, when doing self-introductions, if I say that my pronouns are anything other than ""he/him,"" I feel like I'm problematically co-opting the struggle of TGNC folks, because I am AMAB, I present as male, and I have never felt misgendered when someone called me by ""he/him.""**

In self-introduction situations, what feels most truthful and sincere for me is to not say any preferred pronouns, because I do not prefer any. (I realize it is extremely privileged for me to feel that way, but that doesn't make the feelings any less real.) However, if I skip my pronouns during a self-introduction, I fear that I am not supporting TGNC folks as much as I can, or that I am seen as ""not woke"" or even transphobic. I could say ""he/him or any,"" or ""he/him or they/them,"" or just ""any pronouns,"" etc., but, again, I feel disingenuous doing that when I have never had problems (besides intellectual ones) with the way others gender me. So I always just fall into introducing myself as using ""he/him"" pronouns, in an effort to say the least problematic, most respectful thing, even though it feels dishonest and forced, and makes me feel like I am reinforcing socially constructed gender categories that I think are bullshit.

**Do I have to prefer certain pronouns over others? I know having no preference is privileged, but does that mean it's wrong? If I don't believe I am inherently ""male"" or ""female"" or even ""nonbinary"" (because the term nonbinary implies that there is a binary, which I want to abolish), but for all intents and purposes I'm what the world would consider a straight cis male, then is it problematic for me to introduce myself as taking ""any pronouns"" or ""they/them,"" etc.? In what ways might this post itself be problematic?**

2020-07-21 02:39:39,huzbil,41,12,"I wasn’t sure whether to flare this as Rant, Support, or Discussion. I mentioned elsewhere on reddit that some nonbinary people don’t identify as trans and instead can identify as either cis, or something in between (which is what I identify as), and another nonbinary person showed up trashing me as transphobic. It pissed me off — my identity is mine, and no one gets to gatekeep my identity; plus if gender and sexuality don’t have to be binary, cis/trans-ness doesn’t need to be binary either. I didn’t say we’re categorically not trans, and I explicitly said we’re under the trans umbrella by default, but that I don’t ID as trans. 

It’s not a word that feels right to me, and I’ve done a lot of soul searching on it. For me to want to apply “trans” to myself, I feel I’d have to identify more with the binary gender I wasn’t assigned than the binary gender I was assigned — to me “trans” means crossing a boundary between two states, or being the opposite of something else, like in chemistry for molecules. Therefore “trans” just doesn’t apply here for two reasons: if we’re making gender binary, then I’m closer to my assigned gender at birth; but gender isn’t binary for me, so a word implying and requiring a binary isn’t applicable to me. 

This isn’t the first time this has happened to me either. I’ve definitely had other people get angry and call me transphobic for my identity. But I also know I’m not the only nonbinary person who feels this way. Are all nonbinary non-trans people transphobic by definition? Can one’s identity be inherently transphobic?

so if someone uses the wrong pronouns (i use they/them) but lets say they didnt know i use they/them. example: if a teacher i dont know says something like ""walk slowly miss"" if i was running down the halls or something, when is it appropriate to correct them? cause i cant just stop in the hall, walk over to them, and explain im NB and what that means, and what pronouns i use. so i know that may not be an appropriate time to correct them, but when would be an appropriate time to correct someone from using the wrong pronouns?

and what if the teacher splts the class based off gender, what do i do? what if its a substitute, and they didnt get my email explaining my gender. do i take the time to explain it to them, or just go in a random gender group?

and when meeting new people, when should i bring up im NB? should i tell all people i meet so they know, or just when it comes up? like if someone says she, or he, then i can tell them im NB and that i use they? right?

and the bathrooms!! i think at school there will be a gender neutral bathroom so i geuss i can use that. but it'll be nerve racking. but idk maybe ill meet people in there that i didnt know before (my sister used to meet people and make friends in school bathrooms. i know its odd.) but what if im too nervous too use the gender neutral one and i end up using the girls, and people question my gender cause of it!!

idk. im just nervous. i feel like if i take the time to tell people im nonbinary, ill sound like someone who brings gender into everything and is annoying. but then again my gender is important part of me, so i should take the time. thanks for letting me rant.

I  am a stepparent of two amazing teens. Yesterday, I was speaking with  their mother and she informed me that our youngest has asked to be  referred to using nonbinary pronouns. I am admittedly (and  embarrassingly) pretty uneducated when it comes to the nonbinary  community, so I thought this would be a great place to begin to learn  more and ask a few questions. I've also posted in the nonbinary teen subreddit to get a teen perspective, but also feel it's important to discuss with adults with more experience...

1. Our teen has not yet told us (me and their father) - do  we wait until they are ready to tell us? I just hate thinking about how  much stress and anxiety this could be causing them and worry they will  wait too long and suffer through the stress. But, we also don't want to  push!
2. For those  of you with supportive parents/friends/collegues - what was the very best thing they  did/said that made you feel in all your heart that they 100% supported you?
3. Any recommendations for books, websites, etc for education on the subject?

So this thought came to me when I've had fan accounts. I never really feel the need to specify my gender online or have pronouns specified and like I don't know but I just feel indifferent to gender? Like if someone was to assume I was male or something, I wouldn't be offended. Like I'm just whatever, I don't care how you perceive me.

If I apply for jobs or do surveys, I always put female because that is my sex. I don't feel as if I struggle with or reject my femaleness. I know I was born female. But at the same time, I'm literally like whatever, I'm just a person. I don't dress stereotypically female, i.e dresses and skirts are rare for me.

I don't wear makeup much either because I never liked the idea of not looking like myself.

But here's the issue. I thought that I really didn't mind, but as I look deeper into myself and really think about things I've realized that my pronoun indifference wasn't really for me, but for them. I want them to feel comfortable and not like they're being forced to call me something they're not used to and what feels weird to them.  
My pronouns are 100% They/Them and being called He/Him makes me feels kinda weird in a way I can't describe -- I'm sure some or most of you know what I'm talking about --, and not being able to tell my friends that out of fear is starting to take it's toll on me mentally, especially since I recently told one of them that I didn't mind either way and I dont want them to think I'm a liar. And because of that I've kinda been a bit anti-social towards them.

A friend of mine, who is also NB, said they really only came out because they also changed their name, and they wouldn’t have bothered if they weren’t since they still often get misgendered at work. Is it worth coming out to my large office just to ‘announce’ changing my pronouns? Is it okay to just do it in a more subtle way, like changing the pronouns in my email signature, but not making a big deal about it? For context, I work in admissions for a large university, so my office has ~60 people in it, with the parent office housing over 200 employees. I don’t want to make a big deal, but I also want to be fair to myself? Idk I’m struggling. Any advice here?\n\nTL;DR: changing pronouns but nothing else (including name) is it worth coming out at work or not; especially knowing I’m likely to be constantly misgendered even after coming out.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Came out to my family... now what?', 'created': 1595497410.0}"

i cut my hair super short and started dressing really boyish because that’s what felt most comfortable to me at the time. after that i faced a lot of bullying for my appearance, i was called countless homophobic slurs and other digs at how i presented.

i got really sick of being called ugly, so i grew out my hair and attempted to pass as much as a straight cis white girl as i possibly could. i tried to be as feminine as possible in fear of being considered conventionally unattractive. at this time, being a very impressionable teen, i consumed a lot of conservative politics online that told me being enby isn’t real and stuff like that. effectively suppressing any feelings i had about not fitting into either box for a very long time.

i thought if i presented how i wanted to, nobody would ever love me or find me attractive. specifically straight men. i’m bi but since i live in a small rural area there has never been many wlw girls who i could connect with in that way until now. now that i have a girlfriend i’ve been exploring androgyny a lot more and i feel a lot more comfortable with myself now in the way that i dress.

i’m a cosplayer, and for a while i only cosplayed really feminine girls. i never felt truly confident in cosplay and it never felt like me. however, recently i started cosplaying men and i’ve never felt better about myself.

after getting some attention online for my cosplays i kinda realized i would much rather present this way. i’ve been wanting to bind out of cosplay lately and maybe even try out he/him pronouns. however that also makes me kind of uncomfortable?? i don’t really want to group myself into one particular box. the idea of having to pick one doesn’t sit right with me. 

i’ve been told for so long that there’s only one way to be trans, so i can’t help but feel like all of these feelings are fake because i like wearing skirts and makeup sometimes.

another issue is i’m stressed about having to pick another name, or coming out to people and then having to face ridicule.

2020-07-23 12:00:07,hwedw4,21,3,"Hi! I hope this is an ok place to ask about this, lmk if not! (also, english isn't my first language, lmk if anything I say is wrong or confusing!) 🧡  
I'm very unsure about my gender identity... biologically, i am female, and I have always presented as such. But during the two last years, I have begun questioning if that's not true for me anymore, after I've gotten to know more transpeople, including nonbinary people.   
As it stands right now, I don't feel like a girl. Whenever I'm reffered to as a ""woman"" it feels wrong, and when I see people advocate for womens'-rights, I feel more of a ""yes! good for women :)"" instead of ""yes! good for us :)"", if that makes sense, hahah. 

The problem I feel, is that I present as VERY feminine- both physically, and just how I act in general. And I love that! I love being feminine, and I love my feminine """"womanly"""" figure. So I don't feel any form of body-dysphoria, and I don't feel any need to present as more androgynous. Therefore, I am afraid that I am either underlyingly ""faking"" my discomfort as a woman, or that no one would take me seriously if I explored a nonbinary identity.   


I've felt like this for a long time now, and I finally feel like I want to do something about this. I don't feel like a woman, and definitely not like a man either.

Sorry this is long, I've just had this on my chest for very long, and most of my IRL transfriends are binary-gendered (is that the right word?), and doesn't know that much about nonbinary genders. So I feel like talking to other NB people could help me out! 💕 Also, the reason I ask about specific NB genders, is because I think a label that felt 100% right for me could help me feel better about this, and help me feel less ""fake"" if that makes sense! :)",NonBinary,Am I NB?,1595530807.0,"{'created_utc': 1595505607, 'id': 'hwedw4', 'num_comments': 21, 'score': 3, 'selftext': 'Hi!

(also, english isn\'t my first language, lmk if anything I say is wrong or confusing!) 🧡  \nI\'m very unsure about my gender identity... biologically, i am female, and I have always presented as such.

I feel uncofortable with my masculine features and the masculine expectations. I also feel uncomfortable with being feminine and that some people think being non-binary requires you to counter your birth gender with clothing etc.
I don't really feel like I am a part of the modern ""sensitive man"" trend either. To me it just sounds like a gender version of ""he isn't gay mom, he is just artistic"" (plz don't butcher me for this it is just how it sounds to someone who has been seen as the sensitive boy growing up)

Basically, I feel like nothing.
I also feel like nothing is special about how I feel. 
I just think of myself as someone who just maybe sees gender a bit differently, but most people like me probably feel fine with their binary genders.

I asked a few of my friends some questions about how they see people that fall under ""non-binary"" and that made me feel like shit. They said they were allies, but at the same time told me that they would not give a non binary person a chance in dating for example.

Now I am very much single, and have very few friends in general and that made me realise. Most of the apps that I use for social purposes etc. Require you to choose your gender from the three options. (And most of them don't even let you change it once you have chosen it once) By choosing non-binary, I make myself harder to find by people. The usual person will not choose to include non-binary people in their search when looking for people, due to the misconception about the umbrella term. 

Point being. I do not feel special enough to identify as non-binary. I feel like I want to be seen as a normal person without a gender identity. However, that is not normal to most people, making me not want to answer when people ask for my gender. This does not limit to some stupid apps, but life in general. I do not want to come out to anyone, because I feel like I have always been this way. The only thing I have learned is that others feel gender in a way I do not. And I feel weird even trying to adapt myself to a system that I was never a part of. 

Imagine someone coming to say that suddenly everyone else had always had a feeling about which postal code suits them, and suddenly you are the special one for feeling like you just live in a certain area and thats it.

Since finding out I (23 amab) am in fact not as straight as I thought I was I've been slowly getting more and more comfortable with trying to be who I am instead of pretending to be someone I'm not (internalizing heteronormativity, amatonormativity and toxic masculinity without noticing is actually pretty easy and so much fun to unravel, yay).

So here's what I know so far:

* I don't have a problem with being identified as male
* I have been referred to as female by accident twice and I really liked that, too
* I shave my armpits and legs and I much prefer it to being hairy
* I don't (think I) experience any dysmorphia
* I've recently started painting my nails and I love it

I used to suppress and not show any of my emotions and I try to no longer do that. Having recently been introduced into a new circle of friends with at least half of them being LGBT+ has really helped and I think that my preferred way of showing emotions is one that past me would've labeled as female.

Going by my old definitions of the male and female gender I'm definitely non-binary but tbh I'm no longer sure what any gender is defined as.

I have also from time to time had the urge to wear a skirt or a dress. This urge varying in strength had me thinking that I might be genderfluid.

So to give you some background I was raised female and present femme for the most part. I am also in a relationship with a man so I fit the “part” of a cis straight woman.

Buuuut I’ve always struggled with the confines of being a “woman”. Growing up I was a ""tomboy"", and I always hated being shoved in a box. I also just don’t really identify with being female? I identify with the struggles of misogyny, but I’ve never felt a closeness with the idea of being female.  I stopped shaving a while ago, stopped wearing bras, and have oscillated between short haircuts that are more “androgynous”. I also always tend to gravitate towards larger clothing and grungy outfits that are less feminine.  To clarify it isn't that I think my physical presentation = a gender defining factor, but those are some ways I've allowed myself to be more fluid lately.

So in my head I’ve been calling myself non binary, as it makes me feel more comfortable. I think it’s what I am. But I’m a shy person, and am afraid to “come out” to the world. I don’t really have friends who are queer and my family can be slightly judgmental, although I know they would never disown me or anything. I also feel like a fraud because I present as female and am in a “straight” relationship. So there’s a lot of insecurity about people not taking me seriously.

So I guess my question is: how did you become comfortable enough to “come out” and start using different pronouns? I would love to start using they, but I’m so nervous.

I'm at the stage where I no longer want to force myself into a binary box. (I started T at 16, I'm 33). This is long....so if you hate reading, there is your warning.  I need to release some things. Hopefully you understand. 

All my life I have tried to conform to an identity that society accepted. And one that made me feel safe and gave me a little bit of happiness, though it only lasted for a few short years. 
Reality of being born different, and nothing I do will ever be enough or change that fact, it smacked me hard asf, still licking my wounds tbh. I don't know if it was after the first or 2nd constended surgery, but it just hit me. And any happiness I've had has always been short lived. 

As I've gotten older I've realize that I was never meant to be in the binary. Not completely like cis men and I've never been like women either. Hell I never even went through full female puberty so I don't feel much connection to that. But I do feel like emotionally I have a nice balance of masculine and feminine energy, though it tends to lean more masc in ways, it's not completely, which I feel that's what makes me who I am.

 I was born a girl with ""extras"" that girls aren't supposed to have &amp; also infertile, though I didn't learn this until I was an adult. I've always felt more masc since a child. And society made me hate that fact. Though my family has always accepted whatever I wanted to be, how I wanted to dress etc. I still built up internalized hatred from being masc and afab,  and from liking women since I was young. The internalized hatred I built up from society pushing this narrative of conformity, has caused great harm to me over the last 20 or so years. 

It's only been in the last couple years that I've started to embrace my diffrences and be okay. 20 years ago we didn't have terms like non binary or much support communties to talk about feelings. 
 Not even my therapists helped me work through gender dysphoria or why I felt how I felt. They all were clueless on the topic tbh. I've had to work through all of this on my own. At 13 I discovered I was trans. After watching that stupid boys dont cry movie..that movie kinda ruined me tbh. At that time I felt like it was the answer to why I felt how I felt. Smh I don't think I even fully paid attention to all of the movie back then. That story is too long to tell. 

Any way, I'm liking the term non binary more and more these days. I am masc through and through, but the last couple years I realized I don't yearn to be like cis men anymore. 
Though I look it 😂 I can't change that. This beard aint going no where &amp; T fkd my beautiful hairline up. 😭🤭

I shaved my beard off completely 2 weeks ago, I was going through something idk, a bad depression streak, idk. But by the next day I was literally in tears. At times I feel like my whole life has been a revolving door of poor choices 🤦🏿‍♂️
I went from laughing to crying. I hated the way I looked. I didn't realize how much of an attachment I had to my beard.
Shaving it completely triggered my body dysmorphia something tough. It sucks having gender &amp; body dysmorphia. So I'll never completely shave again!

 Luckily my hair grows hella fast. I'm at the 5 oclock shadow stage, where I can tug on the hairs, haven't had this little facial hair since like 17ish. So it took that to realize that my non binary feelings is more emotional than physical 🤣🤷🏿‍♂️ 

I don't want to put on heels and a skirt part time or anything like that. And I hate that people try to push that you have to want to look like both things or a mix of things to be non binary. 

I did try to paint my nails though... hated it and removed it within 30 mins. I think it was the toe nails is what threw me off 😂 because I was fine with the fingers, but the painted toes, it was too much for me. It was the first time I painted my nails in my life. The black did look bad ass, but it made me feel insecure. 🤦🏿‍♂️ 
definitely some internalized shit there that I didn't realize. So I guess more mental shit I have to work out. Working on yourself is a life long thing!

Today my favourite (don't tell my grandma) cousin came out as Non-Binary to me. They (they still don't know what they want to be called and told me to use they for now) had been out as lesbian for a couple of years and I'm gay myself so it's not like I have any kind of a problem!

I just want to know, from some Non-Binary folks, what they would like their loved ones to know about Non-Binary people. I love them very much and want to be as supportive as possible and learn everything that I need to know to not hurt their feelings with my ignorance!

Thanks a lot!

2020-07-25 00:40:41,hxdi64,3,1,"Hi! I’m Dani? (Still trying out different names) I’m 26, AMAB, Genderfluid, and Pansexual. You may have seen my commenting a LOT recently. I’ve actually been around for quite a while but I never post much of my own stuff. So, I’m finally gonna introduce myself here. *Fair warning: This may get long as I tend to ramble a bit.*

Also: I’m not good at judging these things but I can say for sure: **\[TW: Transphobia\]** (If anyone thinks I should add anything else please let me know)

*(Backstory and relevant info ahead)*

When I was young, I was always referred to as the “boy who was very in touch with his feminine side” by most of my family. This never bothered me because I knew I was. In high school I tried the few labels I knew, and nothing really fit. I experimented with my sexuality too and eventually settled on pansexual. The thing that really held me back was my understanding of being transgender.

Given that my parents knew almost nothing about it and the school system fails in so many ways, my understanding was very basic: If you were a man who wanted to be a woman or vice versa, you could get surgery to change your parts and be more comfortable. That was all. That’s literally ALL I knew about.

I knew that I was at least OK with my body parts as they were. So, I couldn’t be trans. I had met lots of trans people especially in High School and they all fit this definition, so I had no reason to question it. Until one day I was reading a web comic where one of the characters through the help of magic can change their physical traits pretty much at will. Eventually he (as far as I know still prefers he/him) has a bit of a meltdown over complicated feelings about gender when his girlfriend tells him that these feelings sound like genderfluid.

As I read it, he and I have the same reaction. “There’s a name for it?” ([Here](https://www.egscomics.com/comic/2014-07-01) is the page if you want to see yourself) Suddenly a whole world had opened up to me. I started doing research into non-binary gender which I had never even considered were a thing before. Everything just clicked!

I came out to my close friends not long after and they were all TOTALLY supportive. They were also all female and as such had SO many tips about being feminine, dressing, makeup, etc. and most importantly for me... most of them were close enough in size to give me some of their cloths to try on.

(One of these friends went on to become my girlfriend not long after and now she’s my fiancé.)

On my 21st birthday I figured it was time to come out to my parents (who I still live with) about both gender and sexuality. I used some comic that I can no longer find that gave very basic examples of how each works. As expected, they were “supportive” as in... They don’t get it at all, but they want me to be happy. Dad looked like he couldn’t care less which is about as much as can be expected.

I also told them that at least for the time being I didn’t care what they wanted to call me. I was experimenting with pronouns and different terms to see what fit so I didn’t mind. As can be expected the kept with he/him/son/etc. It’s what they were used to. Aside from the occasional “dad joke” my father would use; I didn’t get much support from him. Mom would at least try new things from time to time. She often just referred to me as her “child” to use neutral terms.

On the rare case that I would present feminine around the house, she would call me she/her/daughter and that made me immensely happy. Dad on the other hand, wouldn’t really say anything. He would avoid pretty much any conversation to or about me and he’s probably not aware, but I caught him giving me very concerned looks while he thought I wasn’t looking.

After a while I just stopped doing that any time he was around... or anyone was around for that matter... The only people I was actually comfortable around were my (at the time) best friend who I had known for longer than I can remember, and my girlfriend who had supported me in everything I didn’t since middle school. I was incredibly lucky to have them.

Laura, my best friend, was much thinner than me and as such had a very different style. But she still gave me all kinds of accessories and helped with my hair and makeup when she could. Once I wanted to show off and my mother simply responded with “Wow, I have a daughter!” I was kind of hoping for a bit more, but it made me feel accepted for who I was.

Time goes on. I’m still living with my parents but under a very different arrangement. My girlfriend became my fiancé, and we have a kid together. Laura... Seems to have moved on in her life without me. It seems that My fiancé in the only one who still fully accepts me for who I am anymore. I never feel comfortable presenting any way that not masculine or androgynous around my family, EXPECIALLY with my racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic grandfather who lives RIGHT NEXT DOOR and often comes over without warning.

This year for me has come to be a year of discovery. It’s like I’m waking up from a dream and JUST realizing so much about my life that was right in front of me and I somehow never noticed. Like how my father is borderline abusive to both me and more so to my mother.

But more than that I realized just how much I enjoy boing feminine. Being called “she” or “her” or “daughter” or anything like that. Wearing things that I found comfortable like skirts, dresses, leggings, etc. Roleplaying (mostly in video games) as a woman. One day I looked in the mirror and saw a beautiful woman staring back at me, smiling. That’s when the big one hit me.

My inner image of myself IS a woman! **Mind BLOWN**

I took the next few weeks searching my feelings to figure out exactly what I wanted. Much to my surprise I came to the conclusion that I wanted to at least semi-transition. I’m still not sure exactly how far I want to take it, but I know for sure this is what I want. I still identify as genderfluid, but I realize now that I’ve always leaned more towards the feminine side and now I want to present how I feel.

I started micro-dosing Estradiol a few months ago. I can already see (and more importantly FEEL) some changes. My skin is softer, my body hair is starting to become thinner, and most notably: I HAVE BOOBS! I mean… I *kinda* had something before due to being overweight, but I’ve gained 2 cup sizes in a fairly short amount of time. By far my favorite change in the past few months: My confidence has been boosted to a level I haven’t seen since high school. (I was a theater kid who loved the attention. What can I say?)

However, not all has been good since I started… A few weeks ago, I got into an argument with the person I THOUGHT was my best friend. She and I had dated back in high school and last year got back in touch. We quickly reconnected and got very close. She has stood by me as I discovered all of these things and even offered to help where she could. I needed someone like that in my life.

She’s completely cut off all contact and quite frankly with what she did I want nothing to do with her either. (I’m not gonna go into what happened) But this leaves me with a distinct lack of close friends. Aside from my wife I have: Laura (who rarely talks to me anymore), Joe (who due to various reason I don’t feel comfortable talking about gender and sexuality with), and Tori (another old friend who I recently reconnected with, but I’m not close enough to comfortably talk about these things with).

I guess that’s why I’ve been on here so much. Finding similar people who might just understand me. In any event, that’s pretty much my story. Sorry to anyone who actually just read all of that.

2020-07-25 09:36:21,hxk256,4,2,"This past Thursday morning, out of no where, I discovered that I am bigender (primarily male and a little female). I told my wife that morning. That night she painted my finger nails and even mentioned that she could crochet me a blanket of the flag. She said she was happy that I'm happy and supported me.

I didn't and still don't  really have the intention of telling anyone because it doesn't change how I'm addressed, and I still present male with the exception of nail polish, which is only stereotypically female anyway.

Last night I wrote a brief message about how I've been going to therapy for depression and anxiety, and how I recently discovered being bigender. I just felt the need to write it and possibly share it to my family and in-laws. I read it to my wife and it set her off. She was frustrated at how fast I was taking everything (I have a tendency to obsess over new stuff), and didn't think it was time to share anything nor proper to share it via text. I agree with her, and I'm not sending it.

The conversation we had was tough. I forced her to say something that I was not ready to hear, and I took her time to process away from her. She said everything is different now; everything has changed. She said she's thought about where her and our son will live. She's thought about how this could rob her of a chance at a second child. She's thought about not wanting to stay married. We've been together since high school, and going on 13 years now. She said she loves me, and she supports me 100%, and that she wants me to live my truth, but that she's not sure what she wants. She said leaving doesn't benefit her, but she doesn't know if she wants to stay.

I want her to be happy, and I want what she feels is best for her, but I asked her to at least talk to me about it before leaving is a final decision, which she agreed to. I am absolutely devastated. I feel whole, but I ripped her apart. I took away her time to process everything by having her tell me these things only about 36 hours after figuring it out myself.

What does she mean when she says everything is different? How have things changed? I don't see it, but I want to understand so that I do better to not lose her.

I told my wife that morning. That night she painted my finger nails and even mentioned that she could crochet me a blanket of the flag. She said she was happy that I'm happy and supported me.\n\nI didn't and still don't  really have the intention of telling anyone because it doesn't change how I'm addressed, and I still present male with the exception of nail polish, which is only stereotypically female anyway.\n\nLast night I wrote a brief message about how I've been going to therapy for depression and anxiety, and how I recently discovered being bigender. I just felt the need to write it and possibly share it to my family and in-laws. I read it to my wife and it set her off. She was frustrated at how fast I was taking everything (I have a tendency to obsess over new stuff), and didn't think it was time to share anything nor proper to share it via text. I agree with her, and I'm not sending it.\n\nThe conversation we had was tough. I forced her to say something that I was not ready to hear, and I took her time to process away from her. She said everything is different now; everything has changed. She said she's thought about where her and our son will live. She's thought about how this could rob her of a chance at a second child. She's thought about not wanting to stay married. We've been together since high school, and going on 13 years now. She said she loves me, and she supports me 100%, and that she wants me to live my truth, but that she's not sure what she wants. She said leaving doesn't benefit her, but she doesn't know if she wants to stay.\n\nI want her to be happy, and I want what she feels is best for her, but I asked her to at least talk to me about it before leaving is a final decision, which she agreed to. I am absolutely devastated. I feel whole, but I ripped her apart. I took away her time to process everything by having her tell me these things only about 36 hours after figuring it out myself.\n\nWhat does she mean when she says everything is different? How have things changed? I don't see it, but I want to understand so that I do better to not lose her.

2020-07-25 17:40:51,hxqr05,26,1,"Feeling recently like I'm just a trender and that I just want to feel special, and that I don't deserve the label of nonbinary?

I'm AFAB and I don't plan to transition medically. I present very femme most of the time and have only come out to my closest friends and boyfriend. I still use my birth name, which is gender neutral, and don't plan on changing it. With family and professionally, I use she/her pronouns. My job is very traditional and I would face a lot of hardship and discrimination if I asked to go by anything but feminine pronouns. I also am getting married soon to a cis man, so on all fronts, I appear as a cis, straight woman. I want to get pregnant and have kids in the future. 

However, I do not relate to being a woman. I identify as agender, because that's just what feels right. I hate being called a daughter/wife/woman/etc. I feel best when others refer to me in a neutral way, especially with they/them pronouns.

2020-07-25 22:39:44,hxvr24,8,1,"I'm afab and have been identifying as a lesbian for quite some time. Unfortunately, that's the only label I felt comfortable with so far.

I feel conflicted whenever I have to choose female or male, Mr or Mrs and so on for websites and stuff like that because I don't think either represents me. But I also don't feel good with myself saying that I'm non-binary. I'm not sure why, but maybe it's because I don't think I'm nb enough? Like, I dress fairly female-ish one could say, and I do say things like ""I'm a lady"" or ""Girls night"" and all that.

I'm having a hard time coming up with new gender-neutral names that I like. There's a few so far I've seen that I'm interested in - August, Jasper, Quinn, Piper, Harper, Clover, and Scout, to list a few of them. I am worried about picking a name that comes off as more masculine or feminine because I am on T but still am pretty feminine, and I guess I'm worried about things seeming ""out of balance"" if that makes sense. I'm wondering if maybe I shouldn't be worrying about the balance thing as much as I am?

A name that is pretty gender-neutral is important to me and i would love one that isn't super common, but it's not that big of a deal of it is.

Often it feels enough to say that I'm just *me*, but when everyone else so heavily partakes in something I can't and don't experience, something that is often pushed onto me against my will because it's such a huge part of society, it can feel hard and overwhelming.

I disclosed that I was NB and figuring myself out to some people I thought were friends, and one individual who always makes this big deal about being a trans ally went around shouting an announcement to everyone around that I was NB like...  hours after this original conversation. It just kind of baffled me that they would shout something like that... and the conversation that I originally disclosed about myself was one where I was just educating a mutual friend who was genuinely curious about trans issues and it felt natural to admit to them that I was going through some of the things I was talking about... I explained to them I wasn't out and all and the whole situation has just kind of baffled me. It felt like the person who did this wanted to see how I would react to see if I was faking, and I felt like I was subjected to similar tests from them. It is weird because it felt like the person who was maybe not so informed on trans issues made me feel more seen and affirmed than this friend who I thought was a passionate ally and always talks about their trans friends and how much they love trans people. I have really doubted myself and been really confused since this all happened because I feel like me not being ready means I am just a faker, but I also feel really sad and like the world is grey thinking of only living as my assigned gender.

 There's so much hate on NB for being fakers steering important conversations away from other people that I feel this pressure to present a certain way when really I'm still figuring out who I am. I was definitely not ready to have my identity shouted out to the wind like that when I thought I was just disclosing something private I was still working through.

It feels like if I say that people will think I am just faking or that I am small minded and don't think my assigned gender can be vast or other negative things so I have to hide that part of myself. I also never feel welcome in trans spaces b/c I just don't know if I even qualify as trans and I don't want to take conversations away from people who have 100% trans experiences if you get me, and I feel like if I disclose what I am I will be subjected to more of this testing kind of stuff that really wigs me out. If I say that I feel like I am all these things I feel like no one is going to take this seriously about me and just think I'm making stuff up for attention.  I just feel like I have more to me than one thing and I feel suffocated and bad not being able to live as all these things and being confined to one thing or worried someone is going to want to lock me into one thing or gatekeep me out. It freaks me out being forced to live as my assigned gender only, and it freaks me out having to live as any of my other genders only.

So one reason why I feel weird wondering if I like they/them and he/him pronouns is because just typing the title felt extremely... weird... to say the least. I've always gone by he/him since I am (possibly) a cis man but recently after one of my friends came out as a nonbinary male I've been thinking about the label fitting onto me more. Even before he came out I've thought about this once or twice but just brushed the thought away. Another reason I think I just might be being delusional about this thought is because the label demiboy/demigirl makes me just, annoyed, it's obviously not the meaning behind the label that annoys me it's the label name itself like what the hell is a demiboy?? That doesnt sound respectable at all??? (No hate to you as a person if you go by this label, it's just the name that annoys me) a much more respectable name is nonbinary male/boy/guy/*male synonym*. Now this one might be weird but bare with me, another reason why I think I'm just being weird is because I associate genders with colors, some traditional like males and females with the pink and blue, and some not traditional like enbys in my mind are white instead of green (which tends to be a traditional color enbys label themselves with) etc, so whenever I think of nonbinary men I think of light blue and for some reason I think that would be cool color for your gender so maybe this is just some elaborate plan my brain made so I can have a light blue gender. Another reason I dont I might just be flat out wrong is because I cant even try out they/them and he/him pronouns with my friends cause if I dont like them and decide to stop using them i know atleast one of my friends will make a joke about it (they arent against multiple pronouns either it's just our sense of humor is making fun of someone when they are wrong). And the second to last reason for now is cause I just dont think I look like I would go by he/they, I know that's dumb but whatever. AND THE MOST IMPORTANT REASON, I dont think I have gender dysphoria, im content with my chest and my,, you know. so yeah i think that's it for now sorry for spelling and grammar, if you need me to rewrite something I 100% can and thanks for reading:)




TLDR: I'm 14, no hate to anyone, here are my reasons I might be wrong 

-ive never been called he/they before and it feels weird saying I might use them

-i dont think i have dysphoria 

-i think the label ""demiboy/girl"" is a dumb label, its nonbinary male that's alot more respectable 

-I associate male with blue and nonbinary with white and I've always thought it would be cool to have a ""light blue gender"" so I might be faking it so I can have one, I know that sounds dumb but whatever 

-i cant try out the pronouns without being made fun of if I'm wrong

-I dont think I look like an enby male?? I hope that made sense

I\'ve always gone by he/him since I am (possibly) a cis man but recently after one of my friends came out as a nonbinary male I\'ve been thinking about the label fitting onto me more. Even before he came out I\'ve thought about this once or twice but just brushed the thought away. Another reason I think I just might be being delusional about this thought is because the label demiboy/demigirl makes me just, annoyed, it\'s obviously not the meaning behind the label that annoys me it\'s the label name itself like what the hell is a demiboy?? That doesnt sound respectable at all??? (No hate to you as a person if you go by this label, it\'s just the name that annoys me) a much more respectable name is nonbinary male/boy/guy/*male synonym*. Now this one might be weird but bare with me, another reason why I think I\'m just being weird is because I associate genders with colors, some traditional like males and females with the pink and blue, and some not traditional like enbys in my mind are white instead of green (which tends to be a traditional color enbys label themselves with) etc, so whenever I think of nonbinary men I think of light blue and for some reason I think that would be cool color for your gender so maybe this is just some elaborate plan my brain made so I can have a light blue gender. Another reason I dont I might just be flat out wrong is because I cant even try out they/them and he/him pronouns with my friends cause if I dont like them and decide to stop using them i know atleast one of my friends will make a joke about it (they arent against multiple pronouns either it\'s just our sense of humor is making fun of someone when they are wrong).

I've known I wasn't cisgender for 4, almost 5 years. I came out to my family and friends as FTM transgender almost 2 years ago, and I've socially transitioned and dress masculinely. No medical transitioning, though I want top surgery and testosterone.

The issue is that I don't feel like a guy. I've been questioning this for a very long time, and I kind of just said:"" Okay. You're not a girl, so you're a guy. So you're trans."" and ignored the rest of my feelings. Over female, I would rather be male, but I'd rather be viewed as male and have strangers think I was a guy. I, 100%, do not identify as female at all though I am slightly feminine, I have a lot of dysphoria regarding being female. I am also uncomfortable being overall masculine. 

I don't think I'm 100% not male, I would say that I'm probably 40% male and the other 60% I don't feel like anything. I don't think that means I'm agender though, because I'm okay with being perceived as male most of the time.  And because I still want some male characteristics, I just don't want to 100% be male.

I started questioning my gender identity in... 2014? I'd been wanting to do a 10th Dr Who cosplay and in my go-big-or-go-home manner I was thinking about getting a tailored suit I could wear outside of cosplay, chest binding, find a way to pack etc. Chilling out imagining the finished cosplay I straight up started crying, and that was not a normal cosplay response. I'm pretty sure I cried myself to sleep that night over it.

I already wore a heap of mens clothes. Dress shirts and ties. But I often dressed them quite effeminately (buttoned low, tie pulled loose, mini skirt) unless I was having what I had previously considered a ""lazy day"".

Some of those days stopped feeling lazy. I would sit and cry because my chest didn't look right in any of my stuff, and end up missing uni because of my depression.
But other days I was ecstatic in full 50s starlet or goth femme.

I've since noticed my ""dysphoria days"" are rare, maybe 3 times a year. Most of the time I fall in the middle of gender expression, and then occasionally i go high femme.

My dysphoria days are worse lately. My medication has sent my bewbs from a 12B to a 12F. I cannot squish them enough, but if i get surgery I'll be depressed on my femme days. I am suddenly unavoidably VERY female no matter how I dress.

I've recently started stating my pronouns as she/they. I've been analysing my emotional reactions. I don't feel ""misgendered"" unless I've made an effort in one direction or the other that nobody picks up. I DO get gender euphoria, in all 3+ directions. My childhood felt utterly genderless and I thought that was normal?? A friend once said I have the most effeminate voice he's ever heard and I've never recovered from that one. I LOATHE that I can have children. I want all that internal gear just, gone, asap.

In amongst all this, if people ask my gender I still say ""feeeemalle?"". It doesn't feel right but neither does anything else so far. My new GP, bless her heart, offered to put the question mark in when recording. I just wish a label would stand out. My sexuality was never this hard!!

2020-07-28 02:54:47,hz6p8b,3,1,"Okay, as the title suggests, I've been questioning my gender.  The thoughts have become more frequent as of late, but I have been questioning technically for a couple of years.

So, as a lesbian, I was always destined to have a complex relationship with womanhood, but lately, I've been wondering if it's actually something more than that. 

Just some overall things about me, which have led me to question my identity.

- I hate being called a woman, it feels invasive and suffocating. Especially, when my family would tell me ""what a wonderful young woman I've become"" I hate that wih every fiber of my being

- Still don't know how I feel about she/her. I can't think it's of many instances where people refer to me by just pronouns in my presence. But I know when I see them written on a page, I do feel a discomfort/disconnect, more of the latter if I'm honest. I must admit I find a lot of comfort with they/them pronouns. I don't know, they look ""right"", if that makes sense. I just really like they/them pronouns.

- While I feel uncomfortable with woman/girl/she/her. I'm actually okay with girlfriend/wife. I don't know how I feel about this. I think it might be because I relate it to my queerness, whether I do not relate girl/woman etc... as much to my identity as a queer woman. I don't know what that says about me, but think it's a good detail to throw in.

- I remember when I was first questioning my gender, I wished for society to just all be enby, because everything would be way easier. Which I've heard from enby people os something they thought, before they came out.

- Another point is that I don't really hate my birthname, I just think it's really pretty, and it has family meaning. If it helps, I don't really associate my name with a strictly binary female experience. No specific gender roles were really enforced upon me growing up (my parents are THANKFULLY super cool) So I don't associate it with a female gender role enforced upon me.

- I just like the thought of existing as a fem-alligned person rather than a woman. Just feels like the former describes my experiences more accurately, and I find more comfort in it. 

So yeah, again, trying to begin to figure out whether this is me, as an enby or just not ✨vibing✨ with traditional womanhood because I'm gay.

So the long and the short of the story is that I have a friend who just recently came out to me that they identify as non-binary. I have always supported the LGBTQ+ community and am happy my friend feels comfortable with me to tell me about their identity. 
My problem has been two main things. 

First, when I met them, they identified as female, and I am having a hard time breaking the habit of referring to them not in a female pronoun. Fortunately, they have been very understanding of this, but I really want to break this habit. 

The second problem I am encountering is that using the pronoun “they” feels awkward, like it’s plural. I am having a hard time trying to use this word in this context. I am curious if there is another acceptable pronoun I could use. 

The last problem I have as that my friend told me most persons who are gender non-conforming only live to age 23. My friend is turning 23 in a couple weeks, and I want to do something or get them something to remind them that while I’m not perfect, they will always have my support.

I have multiple doctors appointments a week for more than 6 health conditions. My gender identity is listed in Other: Gender Nonbinary/Neutral in the health system used by most of my doctors. I haven't faced discrimination for my identity so far, but my identity technically isn't official. I'm not sure what I should do. I realized my true identity July of 2015 and have identified as Gender NonBinary for over 5 years. I don't see that changing and I want to identification to reflect that, but I don't also want to cause trouble for myself....Does anyone have an opinion or words of wisdom you could share with me? I have the rest of tonight to think about it, but tomorrow I have the ability to make this choice, and I want to make sure I'm making the right one for me."", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': ""Jude's Law....Do I Change My Gender ID or Leave it be?"", 'created': 1595932910.0}"

I recently found out microdosing was an option but I have very little information about it. I am 32 years old, born a female, and married to a female. I like the idea of a slow process to allow me time to accept the changes and pause as needed.


So here’s the thing - I don’t actually know if I am microdosing. I started two weeks ago. I have been injecting .10 mL of 200mg of T every Saturday. My doctor recommended I start at .10 mL and can go up to .5mL if comfortable. I want to take it very slow considering I do not want to fully transition. I am not comfortable with a beard and really want to avoid balding. I just don’t want to fully transition to a male. What is the full dose of T? What is the minimum I can take for changes? Do people microdose longterm? The only changes I noticed is my body order and I sweat more than usual...but it has been 95 degrees and extremely humid. Could be unrelated.

Aside from the dosage, the doctor said something about my sexuality and sexual pleasure can change. Is this common? I’ve been married for 5 years (together for 10) and I simply cannot imagine my sexuality changing. And besides, I am with my soulmate.

Hi everyone!

So, I've very recently come to the realisation that I'm nonbinary, in part thanks to this subreddit (thanks everyone 💙). I'm AFAB, and I've also realised the extreme discomfort I have towards my chest - that I've been dealing with for my whole adult life (since puberty) - is gender dysphoria. I want to start binding but I need some technical advice on how to measure the 'fullest' part of my chest.

Recently figured out my bra size is 36G (it unfortunately took finding bras that actually fit properly and don't hurt to realise I'll never be comfortable the way I am now lol). My issue is that my breast tissue hangs lower than the typical perky sizing diagrams binder websites have, so I'm not sure how to measure the 'largest' part of my chest. Should I measure myself in a bra? Should I lean forward to get the full actual size? Or should I just measure as is, with no support?

For reference, I think I'm gonna buy from Spectrum Outfitters. Several years ago I actually bought a GC2B binder in Medium but it was too small. I'd happily buy from them again but a lot of their stuff is out of stock atm.

Also, I've done a lot of research, but I'm always happy to hear from people others with experience binding a larger chest. If you have any tips or experiences that you feel like sharing, feel free to :)

Thanks everyone. I really appreciate it 💙

2020-07-29 03:47:23,hztkam,4,1,"I've been able to come out as nonbinary to most of my family, and they're kinda working with it. My mom still slips up a lot, but usually corrects herself, my grandpa can say ""she"" like 5 times in a sentence before I can even correct him. However, there's one person in my family who doesn't care at all.

My dad has made it clear to me multiple times that he does not support me. He's literally said ""You're always going to be \[deadname\], and you're always going to be a she"" like it's okay to say that to your child. He consistently deadnames and misgenders me and when I try to correct him, he either ignores me or blows me off.

Recently, my mom has finally agreed to let me get a legal name change (with my savings for college because she refuses to pay for it, but that's another rant for another day) and since I'm under 18, I need consent from both parents before I can change my name. My dad's known about this for a while, but I don't think he's going to let me.

I originally told both him and my mom I was going to have my deadname as my middle name (just to make my mom stop complaining) but as time went on I realized that I should just completely change my name and leave my deadname behind. I told my mom about this and despite her objections at first, she said it's okay.

TLDR because this ended up being way longer than intended: I don’t know where on the non-binary spectrum I stand, and could use some help figuring it out.

I was hoping you lovely people could maybe help me out a little. Like I said, this is all very new to me and I’m finding it a bit overwhelming to try and pin down what exactly I am. I’m AFAB, and engaged to a cishet guy, and I really want to figure this out (as much as possible) before I come out to him (I’m not expecting him to have any issues with it, but I get very wordy when I’m nervous and as of right now I have no words to describe what I am). 

I’ve tried looking this stuff up myself, but every website seems to have different stuff listed and the only ones that seem to appear on every list (eg androgyne) have different definitions. 

I feel like I’m somewhere on the feminine side but I don’t feel entirely like a woman. I still like my feminine body, and enjoy wearing dresses and skirts, but if I make myself look too feminine it seems to trigger gender dysphoria. Same seems to happen if I dress to masculine, but that doesn’t seem to happen as much, mainly because I don’t do it often. I’ve recently been able to “keep the balance” by cutting my hair really short and styling it in a more traditionally male style, and I really like how that looks with pretty much all of my clothes, especially my skirts.

As for pronouns I have no idea, I haven’t really thought about those much yet, but probably she/they? A bit of a tangent, but does the order you list your pronouns in matter? I’ve heard some people say that whichever you put first is your preferred ones, and the others are just “ok” to use, is this true? (I don’t know which I prefer yet).

So what kind of identities would you associate with all that? I realise it’s something only I can answer and there’s a lot more to how someone identifies than just their pronouns and how they dress, but I’m trying to avoid this turning into a 10 page essay, more than it already is hahaha. I think I just need someone to help point me in the right direction is all. I read about demigirl a bit and it sounds close but not quite right. I’m not really sure if any others though. I’m definitely not agender but outside of that I’m not really sure.

\*name edited out for Reddit post, actual name is in the real letter.

\---------------------------

Mom,

I wanted to say all of this to you in person, but I didn’t think I’d be able to get the words out. So I decided I’d do what I’d do best; I’d write. So here I am, writing to you, to say all the words I’ve struggled to say for so long.

You’ve known I’m genderfluid/non-binary for a while now. You don’t necessarily need to understand what that means, but you need to understand that this isn’t a phase I’m going to grow out of and it is a significant part of me and my identity. I can’t explain to you what gender identity feels like. There’s a saying; “gender is like a bone, you only feel it if it’s broken.”

This doesn’t mean there’s nothing feminine about me. Much like (boy I was friends with in high school)\* is still very much a boy despite liking to wear makeup and do feminine things, I’m non-binary even if I like to wear a dress sometimes. I am not a girl, I am not a boy. Sometimes I am, but most of the time, I’m not. Most days I’m either both or neither. And again, you don’t need to know what that means or understand how it works, because to be honest, I’m not sure I fully understand it either. But I understand myself enough to know that’s how I feel, that’s where I’m most comfortable, and that’s what feels the most *me.*

If I had my way, you and Dad would only ever call me Artie, would use they/them instead of she/her, and would use gender-neutral words to describe me in most/all situations. But I know that trying to reinforce that would lead to you reminding me how difficult it is for you and how much it hurts you that I’ve rejected the name you took so much care in choosing for me. That’s why I went lax with you guys about it. Not because I didn’t care or because I didn’t have a strong preference, but because I didn’t know if it was worth the constant reminder that I’m hurting you by being who I am.

I know you picked out a special name for me. I get it. But you should know how much discomfort it gives me. Hearing it, seeing it, even saying it or thinking it can make me extremely uncomfortable. The most similar feeling I can compare it to is being called a nickname you never asked for and never wanted. Like when a stranger calls you “baby” or “sweetie” or “honey.” When that happens to me, I want to jump out of my own skin and stop existing. I get a knot in my gut and my skin crawls and I hate it. And the same thing happens when I think of/hear/see/say my old name. My deadname. (That’s the term used for the name you were assigned at birth that you no longer go by.)

Artie isn’t a nickname for me. Sure, that’s the excuse I’d use in lieu of having the full gender conversation with some people, but that’s not the truth. My old name is more of a nickname than Artie is.

When I was in middle school, I discovered I was super uncomfortable with my name. That’s how long this has been going on for. Seventh or eighth grade, to be exact. When I was in high school, I seriously considered going by the name Luna because I was used to being called that online and I really, genuinely didn’t like my name. And that was before I started questioning my gender and experimenting with my expression.

Luna was an online nickname I got used to. (Name too close to my deadname for me to feel comfortable posting it here)\* was a placeholder nickname for while I was figuring myself out. Lynn is an acceptable nickname I’ll still accept to this day. But Artie? Artie *is* my name. 

While I was trying to find names, there were plenty of names that I liked. I liked the name Robin. I liked the name Riott. But the moment I saw the name Artie it clicked. It felt right. Instantly, I knew I found my name. It wasn’t even a name I particularly loved, it just felt like *me.* That was in my senior year of high school. It’s been almost three years since I started going by the name Artie and I’ve had no regrets about it since.

Which leads me to this; I’m legally changing my name soon. I know it’s hard for you to hear, but it’s something I have to do. I don’t want to constantly have to see my deadname when I’m checking my bank account, or say it on the phone in professional settings, or think about it when filling out applications. And in the future,  I don’t want to have to retroactively try to change the name on my degree to match, I don’t want to get married under my deadname, and I don’t want to explain to potential bosses/coworkers about the discrepancy between my real name and my legal name. That’s why I want to do it soon, so I have less to change and less to worry about in the future.

In about six months time from when I’m writing this (January 2021) if COVID is under control (because it involves going to the courthouse and I’d rather not do that in the middle of a pandemic if not strictly necessary) then I am going through with the process of legally changing my name. You won’t be paying the fee; my birthday present from (college roommate)\* was the money to do this. I’m an adult now and this is my decision to make. This sounds aggressive but I mean it in the nicest way possible; this isn’t about you. But you are still my mom and I want you to be on my side through this.

I love you, and I’ll always be the same child you’ve always known. I’m the same person, just with a different name. I’m still the stuffed-animal loving creative writer who talks too fast and too much about stuff I love and care about. I’m still the person who loves playing board games with you and with my friends. I’m still the person with an affinity for hilariously terrible movies, especially silent ones.

And I’m still your kid who loves you very much.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope after hearing everything I had to say, you’ll understand the situation a little better.

Love,

And in the future,  I don’t want to have to retroactively try to change the name on my degree to match, I don’t want to get married under my deadname, and I don’t want to explain to potential bosses/coworkers about the discrepancy between my real name and my legal name. That’s why I want to do it soon, so I have less to change and less to worry about in the future.\n\nIn about six months time from when I’m writing this (January 2021) if COVID is under control (because it involves going to the courthouse and I’d rather not do that in the middle of a pandemic if not strictly necessary) then I am going through with the process of legally changing my name. You won’t be paying the fee; my birthday present from (college roommate)\\* was the money to do this. I’m an adult now and this is my decision to make. This sounds aggressive but I mean it in the nicest way possible; this isn’t about you. But you are still my mom and I want you to be on my side through this.\n\nI love you, and I’ll always be the same child you’ve always known. I’m the same person, just with a different name. I’m still the stuffed-animal loving creative writer who talks too fast and too much about stuff I love and care about. I’m still the person who loves playing board games with you and with my friends. I’m still the person with an affinity for hilariously terrible movies, especially silent ones.\n\nAnd I’m still your kid who loves you very much.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope after hearing everything I had to say, you’ll understand the situation a little better.\n\nLove,\n\nArtie Lynn"", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'I wrote a letter to my mom about wanting to change my name.

Maybe I’m just too sensitive. Maybe [insert a dozen other possibilities]. But I still feel bad about the whole incident.\n\nSo I’m asking you good folk: Am I overreacting?

2020-07-30 07:55:52,i0i29r,2,1,"Like for example I feel like a woman most of the time these days, but I found that when I'm doing specific things like listening to metal or post-rock, reading passages in literature that aren't ""flowy"" or wearing my brother's old clothes (I like doing that because it makes me feel invulnerable and confident) I tend to feel more masculine, but it's not masculine in the way a cis man would experience masculinity... it's like a softer kind of masculinity (idk how to describe it the English language feels so inadequate sometimes ermahgawd).  And when I write my poems I feel distinctly more feminine, but not 100%.  When I read Sylvia Plath the feminine feeling decreases.  When I write short stories I don't really perceive the gendered part of my mind as such, it's not like it disappears but I just feel more like a mind than a person, if that makes sense.

Also, sometimes my gender does weird stuff in response to the language I'm reading?  Like when I read/ write English I feel more masculine (it depends on the genre I'm reading, if I read satire I feel almost 80-90% feminine) but when I read German I feel different from that.

I thought of calling myself genderfluid but it doesn't really, you know, 'click' for me.  I stopped using she/ her pronouns for myself fairly recently because it felt too restrictive to me.  Also sometimes I feel like there are parts of myself that don't come out unless I'm alone because I've had a traumatic childhood (more like traumatic life but I don't want to depress myself so let's ignore that) and repressed some parts of my expression.  And I feel this intense pressure to ""be a proper woman"" on account of the society of the country I live in, which I hate because being a stereotypical woman (be a good hostess, get baby fever, be demure/ coy, be good at cooking, be good at holding conversations) doesn't come naturally to me and I've always felt insecure for not being feminine enough like that but then I figured I should just own my GNC parts instead of trying to fight them.  And find a life partner who's accepting of my expression(s) of my identity/ identities.  My parents are always busy fighting so it's not like they're gonna notice anyway, lol.

And when I write my poems I feel distinctly more feminine, but not 100%.  When I read Sylvia Plath the feminine feeling decreases.  When I write short stories I don\'t really perceive the gendered part of my mind as such, it\'s not like it disappears but I just feel more like a mind than a person, if that makes sense.\n\nAlso, sometimes my gender does weird stuff in response to the language I\'m reading?

2020-07-30 08:16:30,i0ia8u,5,1,"Cisgender male here (for now?).  I was born male and have always considered myself male.  Only recently have I started really thinking about my gender identity and whether it fits me, or if maybe I'm non-binary.  I've been bothered by gender roles since my early teen years, and have always thought of myself as being a bit more feminine than my other cisgender guy friends.  Sure, I'd never let it stop me from accepting an invitation to hang out with ""the boys"", and I still have a lot of ""traditionally"" masculine hobbies to this day.  I am not attracted to men, I dress like a man, and have never been bothered by masculine pronouns, but I can't stop thinking about it lately... what if I'm not *just* male.   
I suppose I've always been a little bit jealous of women; whether it's the way they dress, act, talk, or whatever, I don't know.  Without even picking it up as an indicator that I may not be cisgender, I thought of a female persona of myself about a year ago with a new name that I still identify with almost as much as my birth name.  And now that I'm seriously considering that I may be nonbinary, I can't stop thinking about it.

I've never experienced strong dysphoria, which I thought might be an indication that I was right about being cisgender, and I get *chills* thinking about coming out to my conservative catholic parents.  But the idea of being non-binary just seems... *freeing*.  It makes me feel like I can do whatever I want, without the limits put on me by society.  I can make myself look pretty, do whatever I want with my hair... feel more comfortable role-playing female characters in video games / ttrpgs, which is something I've always done.  But also, these are all very new thoughts, and I'm sure I don't want to commit to anything before thinking about it long and hard.

for the last few months I have identified as a lesbian demigirl because I felt connected to being a girl and be non-binary while being attracted to females. However I do not feel that the term demigirl accurately describes how I feel.

There are times where I feel completely non-binary and there are times where I feel Like a woman (I'm AFAB). I feel so 0 connection or attraction to masculinity in my gender sexuality or romantic orientation. Because of this I sometimes identify as a lesbian and I still have to identify as a Trixic(non binary attracted to woman).

I'm AFAB, and some memories about me as a child ""dressing up"" and acting as a boy (and feeling empowered by it!) returned to my consciousness.

This afternoon, I was hanging out with my friend at the park. We had reunited after months of not seeing each other because of the lockdown. We were so, so happy to had finally met.

The sky was crystal clear and the sun was bright, nicely warming up our faces in a chilly day of winter. We'd been talking about several stuff, excitedly getting updated about each other's lives.

Right afterwards, I felt a literal weight being lifted from my shoulders, and I might have made some pretty obvious movement because my friend looked at me once more and went ""Hey, it's like something got released from your body, did you feel it?"". Hell yeah I did, lol! Wow.

Before today, I had come to the conclusion that I was non-binary &amp; genderfluid.

I didn't feel I was ""trans enough"". Today, I felt that part of me was accepted and validated, not only by my friend but, most importantly, by myself.

2020-07-31 11:58:31,i169ie,3,1," So, I don’t want to make this long and boring but I kind of need some help figuring myself out

I’m a 22 years old afab, and I have been recently questioning my ender identity. All my life I thought I was a cis woman, although that never felt like completely what I was at 100% 

I thought that being NB was only for people that were neither man or women but a friend of mine recently taught me that NB people can also be people that are kind of both and all at the same time, that it’s a whole spectrum, and something clicked on me with that. 

I used to be a very tomboy kid growing up and sometimes people even confused me for a boy and referred to me with he/him pronouns and I loved that, but I never thought that I was a trans man because I have never had dysphoria with my body or with she/her pronouns. 

It’s like I have never understand the concept in my head of the two genders, I don’t know if that make sense but, in my head, they fluctuate, like they’re all the same for me as my identity. A lot of people dismiss me for that way of thinking because they said it was because I’m not neurotypical and they thought that was just me being autistic, which honestly felt like a bit of ableism to me but that’s another whole story. But also, discussing that with my also autistic friends, each one of them have different opinions, like my friend knows he is a cis man and has never doubted and another one knows she is a cis woman and doesn’t share my idea but she comprehends it. So, I’m only saying this in a way of trying to justify myself in saying that I don’t think I’m nb because of my autism.

And the last think that got me thinking that I could be nb is because I have never recognised myself in my legal name. It’s Maria, which is a very typical female name, and it always felt like there was something missing. Even so, that since primary school I had this nickname out of my initials, Moa, and that is the only name that I have ever used since then online and with my close friends and even family IRL and I feel more identified by it, because, at least when it’s online, people that don’t know me never get to know for sure my gender from my name and that just feels right with me. Like, online I have been treated with any pronoun other that she/her and I loved that.

Recently since this discovering I’ve been trying to use neutral pronouns in Spanish (cause I’m Spanish) and they/them in English and It just feels euphoric, idk if you get me, but I feel great. But I also don’t feel misgendered when people use she/her or he /him with me, and I don’t have any dysphoria with my body, and I can dress very tomboy and very “girly” and everything will feel great (I know these are just stereotypes and clothes don’ have gender, but I felt like explaining myself) , So could I be NB or am I just a very confused cis woman? Can I still be NB even if I use any pronouns, but prefer they/them?

Do cis people question their gender? Could this just be that?

In any fresh relationship you get tongue tied and don’t think you have the right words to say or a good enough compliment or adjective to use.

My mom says she’s LGBTQ friendly, which at first I believed, since she doesn’t care that I’m bi. But she always jokes and makes fun of trans people and says people who change their gender are weird.
My grandma also says that she doesn’t support people changing their gender, but she’s sorta okay with gay people (not really, she always is rude to me and my friends if she finds out they’re gay)
My dad doesn’t really care, and actually buys me some pride stuff sometimes.
But I don’t feel ready to come out yet and I need some advice to ask for masculine clothing without it seeming suspicious.",NonBinary,Help??
