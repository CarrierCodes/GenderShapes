2020-11-01 01:53:57,jluj1t,6,1,"TW going into body stuff and being angsty

It wasn’t really a realization, I just never had a word for it before.

I’ve had gender dysphoria all my life. When I was 18 I discovered a trans forum on the internet (back in 2009). I secretly bought myself a binder even though I didn’t I identify as male. I wasn’t sure what I was doing. And then I sort of blocked it out, wrote it off as just “experimenting” or something. I never heard anyone say non-binary

I came out as lesbian at 19 but I never felt fully comfortable. I thought it was internalized homophobia, which it partly was. But even among other lesbians I felt like I didn’t belong. I’m almost 30 now and somewhat comfortable with myself, I didn’t feel the need to explore the gender stuff anymore. I know I cannot wear feminine clothes or present feminine in any way without feeling awful, but I don’t want to be seen as male either. I only dress in an androgynous way. When people mistake me for a male I’m not a big fan. And that does happen, but I usually laugh it off now

So I feel nb on the inside. Because when people treat me like a woman, it makes me feel uneasy. And maybe that’s a bit natural in some ways because it’s hard to be female presenting in general. I couldn’t talk about periods or bras for most of my life without massive anxiety. I’ve become more comfortable with it now but that wasn’t until my mid 20s. Maybe I’ve just put myself in a box because it’s easier. But I don’t know, I don’t know if I’m ready to socially transition or if I ever will be. I’m honestly a little distressed about this but I’m coming to terms with it slowly

I always liked using the word “gay” more than “lesbian” which might be part of it lol. More things just keep adding up. But I just don’t want to be rejected by the lesbian community :( and I struggle to understand what this all means

But yes I was that 4 year old having a meltdown when my mom tried to put me in a dress. And I always pretended to be boy characters in elementary school. I wasn’t ok with being female until I learned it was ok to be gay... I thought I was ok now, but I still don’t feel right. It’s hard to sort through my own mind in an objective way

I want to tell my therapist about it on Monday and just explore it. I guess I’d like feedback and to hear other people’s stories.

I’m afab and I’ve always been pretty comfortable being viewed as a girl. I’ve never felt dysphoric and in general I’ve always been okay with my curves. I do, however, like dressing androgynously.This has never been a problem for me since I always thought I just liked to present both masculine and feminine features. 

But last week, I had the random thought to make myself look more androgynous by using a small sports bra to hide my chest, and I *really* liked the way it made me look. It made me wonder what it would be like to be perceived as neither a man or a woman. And that’s made me weirdly excited. So since then, Ive constantly been wearing baggy clothes and a sports bra, and not wearing that sports bra or no bra at all has made me slightly uncomfortable. I’m not gonna call this dysphoria because, again, I’ve never had dysphoria in my life and have often worked to emphasize my chest, so I seriously doubt that’s the case. 

But now I’m questioning and I’m so confused. Am I actually happy with being a girl? I’ve understood and acknowledged the existence of non-binary people for years now without it raising a question in me. Why has this only started now? Am I just a confused cis girl? What even is gender beyond a bunch of overdone stereotypes? Do I actually see myself as a girl or is that what I just default to because that’s how I was raised?

As a kid I was labeled as a tomboy and was very proud of that because it made me feel separate from the other girls, but in general I’ve never had a huge problem with presenting feminine or being considered a girl until last week.

I‘ve historically identified as a cis woman, but in recent years I’ve really been questioning my own gender identity as the concept of gender itself. I feel the urge to say I feel like I do not really identify with any gender, the whole gender thing feels a little bs for me personally. But I want to be so cavalier and just call myself non binary without really understanding things because that’s hella rude and insulting to the queer community. I would love to hear your journeys in discovering your identity and get feedback as to whether or not what I’m feeling is similar to how you all discovered it.

Ever since I was a kid, I never really liked being a girl. I mostly played with boys, I hated dresses, and I hated when people referred to me with overtly stereotypically feminine descriptors. Whenever I played pretend, I always pretended to be a boy. I had this recurring character named Alex, he was kind of a secret agent type, hyper masculine damaged boy archetype. Any time I tried to play a girl character it felt wrong.

I really learned this when I got to college I allowed myself to not conform to how my conservative family wanted me and began dressing androgynously. I don’t really have a lot of dysphoria, I’m more or less comfortable with my body. I enjoy dressing androgynously and love when people don’t immediately know I am female bodied. A few times strangers have referred to me as he before I corrected them, but I wasn’t offended by it. It felt really good. It was nice that they didn’t identify me as a woman. Whenever people ask for my pronouns, I feel really happy that they don’t just assume I’m a woman. 

I really love drag. I have a king character, he’s a little femme, but definitely a man. Being him feels really good. But outside of drag I don’t really feel like a man either.

Bottom line, I don’t really get being a woman or being a man. But I wonder if it’s just because I don’t like how society treats women and it’s internalized misogyny or if I’m actually enby. I’m very confused, please help! Lol

I\'ve kind of tried both things and felt like absolute crap.\n\nI used to think I was a cisgender bisexual woman when I wasn\'t involved in the queer community. I wish I never got involved at all. It\'s so much easier to live in the closet when you\'re closeted to yourself.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'One or the other: Keep my sexuality or keep my gender', 'created': 1604322597.0}"

(Other than my partner and I being non-binary, my question isn’t related to gender)

My partner and I have been apart for a month now due to family issues out of state. I’ve been with my folks while my partner is at our home. We talk everyday and have been both struggling lately with our mental health. 

I struggle with communication and speaking up when I feel upset in the moment vs. bottling it up until it’s too much. This is something I recognize and I’m trying to work on. 

That being said, I’ve been having high anxiety about making my folks sick with Covid-19. Much worse than necessary. And my partner is flying out to meet and stay with me so we can drive home together. 

My partner is spending time with their friend (who needs some support right now) but it involves a little more risk when it comes to social distancing. I trust my partner and I trust their friend, but I don’t trust any of the other people in the group. I don’t know their lives and I don’t know their habits. I know that some aren’t wearing masks, and then also found out that they (my partner and friend) went to an outside bar. And now I think the friend is over to make food. 

I didn’t speak up when I first found out about the bar b/c I didn’t want to be controlling or mean, and at the same time I feel really nervous about how they’re about to come to my folks home (one of which is very at risk) but are still seeing friends. 

If this was just us, or if they weren’t coming to my folks home I wouldn’t have a problem with this. However, since they’ll be here in less than a week, I’m a little scared of the lack of social distancing. 

I love my partner so much, and I want to talk them about this, but I need advice on not getting angry or accusatory. I get it, I really do, especially when this friend is going through the shit right now and needs support...and I also need them to see my point of view with my folks. I just...don’t know what I’d do if they got sick because of us. 

Is it best to call them now when it’s early in the morning (they’re still up) but possibly a few beers in? Is it better to wait until the morning?

2020-11-02 09:22:34,jmkf4o,2,1,"So. This will be long.

Something is not right. A bit of background. I'm 38, which means I grew up in the 80s and 90s when rural areas didn't have trans people (kidding obviously, they were there. we just didn't know what they were or that they existed and if we did, they were trans women that were spoken badly of because ignorance and transphobia was the in thing then). 

I had what would probably be pegged at pretty classic gender dysphoria around puberty, maybe some stuff before that. My memory is weird though and I don't remember/process/relate like some people do, so it's hard to say on some things. But, puberty was an issue. Getting a chest was deeply traumatic and I wanted a hysto since I realized that was there and also could be removed. As I got older, I would say I was ""female but not really attached to the idea"", wished I had stuff like, oh, ya know, guy parts, etc. Normal cis things. For the past few years, I'd kinda considered myself non-binary after discovering the concept but hadn't told anyone. Then summer 2019 I had a sort of weird nervous breakdown after trying to dress really feminine for a new job and ended up discovering concepts like ""dysphoria"". After experimenting with presentation, that dysphoria took the fuck OFF. I couldn't cope with anything feminine at all. All my dysphoria was about the body I was born with, and all the euphoria was about guy stuff. Figured I was binary trans, eventually. Came out, wrote movingly on the subject, started T. Therapist (who turned out to be a bit of a dipshit who called me a robot ""jokingly"" when I was discussing asexuality) was gung-ho about me being binary trans. 

Things seemed fine. Except socially. There was always a problem there. I never related to trans guys who were ""one of the boys"" and just were Capital M Male. That...wasn't me but I thought I would just adjust somehow. All that dysphoria. All that euphoria over binding and packing and such. I mean, I had to be binary trans, right? I'd adjust to the social stuff, even though I'd never been ""one of the boys"" any more than I'd ever been ""one of the girls"". I've never been ""one of the anything"". But I haven't adjusted. And I'm getting uncomfortable. I don't think I'm binary trans. I don't think I'm a man. I'm like...a guy. A masculine person. But I don't think I'm a man, after all. I don't think I'm cis and mistake, though, either, because the thought of going back to female is horrifying. I thought maybe I was just an atypical trans guy who's a bit gender non-conforming and having trouble adjusting but I don't know. I don't know anymore. I was so sure. I CAME OUT. And people are NOT supportive. My partner left me. I just...I think I fucked up. I don't regret T, mind you. I've been on a low dose since February of this year and I feel saner and happier than I ever have and the small physical changes I've had are great. 

But socially? Things are not ok. It doesn't help that I don't pass even slightly and live in a conservative rural area, but still. Still. And with covid and masks, I've had a few experiences of people having NO idea how to gender me. ""They"" ""That person"" Or, my favorite, on a hiking trail when someone's kid ran up behind me, their mom yelled ""Careful, don't bump into the.....the....uh, 'scuse us!"" And that....has felt so good. Like really good, to just not be gendered at all. Is it just that normally I get ""ma'am"" without a second thought and it's better than female or does that, combined with the fact I feel completely fake calling myself a man maybe mean something? Does it? 

I want nothing to do with gender. I don't want one. I just....don't know what to do. What am I? Am I just a scared and slightly odd trans guy who blew up his life a little? Or was I right....because when I first really started digging in to this, I said that I was afraid that if I went all the way to the male side, I'd feel just as trapped as female? Was I right? What the fuck is wrong with me? And if I am non-binary trans masc after all, what the hell do I tell people? Sometimes ""they"" would be really nice, but I can't even get ""he"" out of anyone. No one understands/accepts me being binary trans, so non-binary would be harder, plus there's that whole stigma of trans people are supposed to be sure and always have known and that whole narrative.

A:
Take the tell and drape it over your shoulders and use a clip to secure it and if you want to secure it more, hold it by the bottom so now you’re a mysterious hooded figure who is the banisher of any insecurities

Take a fluffy gown and dry yourself with the towel and then wear the gown so now you’re a huge fluff ball of perfection

2020-11-02 22:57:12,jmydaa,1,1,"(Long post sorry 😕) 

I constantly feel like there’s a difference between who I know I am with myself and the way that I present myself to the rest of the world. I don’t mean that I’m pretending to be cis (afab) or over-performing gender roles or anything, I am by no means a feminine person, and I’m pretty open with my friends about being nonbinary. 

The issue is, most of the time they just don’t get it. They’re coming from a completely different point of view, and often when I say that I’m “not a woman, I’m nonbinary” they hear “I want to be a man.” No matter how many times I say “no, I’m just myself, I’m already the person that I’m happiest being, I’m not trying to change anything, you know me,” they refuse to hear it. It’s always “you want to look like a man,” “you want to be a man,” and it. Really really sucks. 

And then to still always hear too that “you’re attracted to the wrong type of person for the way that you look, men like feminine girls and studs like femmes, you’re never going to find love if you’re not willing to be the woman in the relationship,” especially coming from someone who I have dated before while we still have some sort of feelings for each other? 

Like how are you gonna tell me that you approached me and fell for me because of my energy, it was different and you liked that, and then turn around and try to tell me to change myself?? And it’s so frustrating and it hurts because with my friends and this person it’s just. If you would just LISTEN and hear what I’m saying none of this would be an issue, but they can’t and won’t listen or understand. They’re so caught up in their own ideas that they stop seeing me, and in their minds I turn into someone else entirely. 

I’m sorry for venting but things are just really hard lately and I feel like I’m losing touch with other people and with myself, my best friend recently moved away and she’s one of the only people (if not the only one) who really sees ME, no extra ideas, to the point where she’s more uncomfortable when people misgender me than I am, so now without her around it’s like..

Really really sucks. \n\nAnd then to still always hear too that “you’re attracted to the wrong type of person for the way that you look, men like feminine girls and studs like femmes, you’re never going to find love if you’re not willing to be the woman in the relationship,” especially coming from someone who I have dated before while we still have some sort of feelings for each other? \n\nLike how are you gonna tell me that you approached me and fell for me because of my energy, it was different and you liked that, and then turn around and try to tell me to change myself?? And it’s so frustrating and it hurts because with my friends and this person it’s just. If you would just LISTEN and hear what I’m saying none of this would be an issue, but they can’t and won’t listen or understand. They’re so caught up in their own ideas that they stop seeing me, and in their minds I turn into someone else entirely. \n\nI’m sorry for venting but things are just really hard lately and I feel like I’m losing touch with other people and with myself, my best friend recently moved away and she’s one of the only people (if not the only one) who really sees ME, no extra ideas, to the point where she’s more uncomfortable when people misgender me than I am, so now without her around it’s like.. I’m struggling to keep a hold of myself and not let these other people convince me to “change” and hide again.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'I feel lost', 'created': 1604383032.0}"

Like most of the people in that article, I had PCOS as my doctor states from birth. He penned it as a ""very severe chronic case"" of PCOS because I had/have every textbook symptom, including the dark patches of skin around your body from insulin resistance, etc from an extremely early age. One thing that ALWAYS made me be unable to choose if I'm just a SUPER butch tomboy or a transmale has been the fact that my body never ""chose"". Sure, I have a vagina and I got my cycles at 8, but there was times I wouldn't have one for an entire year or more and was extremely happy and content with that. And even before then, I always ran with my brothers, and quit all my sports and hobbies because having a chest just made me dysphoric. And I notice it's not essentially my hormones that dictate me feeling more masc/femme, but also my partners. If I'm dating a more masc partner, I take a more femme approach if they're into that and vice versa just because I naturally can. Now that I'm with someone who quite frankly doesn't give a shit, I do take a more masc approach though. And now that I know I can go on T and do IVF, anything female related my body does, I'm comfortable with it stopping until I have need for it. 


I did realize though, that going through the motions of taking the estrogen/progesterone and all of the ovulatory medications to make me menstruate, I do feel more femme, even if I'm not happier with it, I was fine being a very masc ""girl"". 
I can't start T until December, but when I do have imbalances and the symptoms get worse, even with the major pain of it all, I'm A LOT happier with the male changes. I can only imagine what T will be like and I just wonder how much of a difference my brain will feel about my body. 

One comment mentioned PCOS being an Intersex condition and I definitely could agree with that, but only based on my experience. I was always angry my body wouldn't choose one or the other. It's just in the middle.

What do you guys think? 

My own theory for myself: Maybe PCOS did happen at birth like my GYN believes, and my brain never chose because my body never did either, thus me identifying as Non-Binary even though I was born with female sex characteristics that make me AFAB. But that wouldn't explain the loads of cisgendered women with PCOS who hate the elevated testosterone levels and symptoms. And the loans of Trans Folx who don't have PCOS and still are trans.

2020-11-04 19:21:49,jo31hm,3,1,"Hi guys/gals/non-binary pals. I'm 15F (biologically) and I'm struggling. I have always felt a little... Off. Like, I saw girls, I loved girls, but I always felt that I wasn't a girl. I put it down to disassociation I guess. When I hit puberty around 12 was when shit hit the metaphorical fan and I really started feeling wrong in my body. I've always been a little chubby, but not huge (5'6 and currently 11.5 stone or around 165lbs I believe) and I was convinced it was that and that was the reason I was feeling this way. That made me struggle with multiple eating disorders over the years which I'm still struggling with to this day but getting better at getting rid of. 


I actually don't know if I'm non-binary to be honest. I don't struggle with dysphoria around my genitalia or hips, but I feel really really really dysphoric about my boobs 90% of the time. I'm okay with being referred to as a part of ‘girls’ but it makes me uncomfortable when people call me alone a girl. I like to wear skirts, mary janes and makeup but there are some days that I can't stop crying about how I WISH I could be more androgynous (my boobs are a uk E cup so very difficult to hide haha).


I've told my best friend about how I feel and she's been supportive as hell, I love her so much. The thing is though, my mum doesn't believe in non binary. PLEASE don't think that my mum is a homophobe as she's really really not and is very supportive of me being gay, but she thinks that being non binary is a mental illness.

I'm 15F (biologically) and I'm struggling. I have always felt a little... Off. Like, I saw girls, I loved girls, but I always felt that I wasn't a girl. I put it down to disassociation I guess. When I hit puberty around 12 was when shit hit the metaphorical fan and I really started feeling wrong in my body. I've always been a little chubby, but not huge (5'6 and currently 11.5 stone or around 165lbs I believe) and I was convinced it was that and that was the reason I was feeling this way. That made me struggle with multiple eating disorders over the years which I'm still struggling with to this day but getting better at getting rid of. \n\n\nI actually don't know if I'm non-binary to be honest. I don't struggle with dysphoria around my genitalia or hips, but I feel really really really dysphoric about my boobs 90% of the time. I'm okay with being referred to as a part of ‘girls’ but it makes me uncomfortable when people call me alone a girl. I like to wear skirts, mary janes and makeup but there are some days that I can't stop crying about how I WISH I could be more androgynous (my boobs are a uk E cup so very difficult to hide haha).\n\n\nI've told my best friend about how I feel and she's been supportive as hell, I love her so much.

2020-11-05 00:27:46,jo8ihd,2,1,"Hello beautiful people,

I'm a cisgender woman. I'd describe myself as a girl/woman/lady/young lady/female only, and wish to be recognized as this to others. I try to live my life without being pushed into a role by others, and while it's freeing to act and dress in a way I enjoy without the limitations of what others say is masculine or feminine, I feel in my soul that I'm simply feminine.

And yet, she/her feels slightly dysphoric. English pronouns demands that the person's gender be identified while referring to them, and this constant reference seems unnecessary and sexist. There are many other languages where pronouns reveal information about the person their referencing, like physical distance from the speaker, rank, or informal/formal relationship. All of these seem important, while gender rarely seems to be relevant. A doctor writing ""female patient"" denotes important anatomy. Someone saying ""Excuse me, young lady"" identifies me among the crowd. A date calling me a  ""beautiful girl"" is a compliment to the femininity I purposefully cultivated.

""He was shirtless"" is normal while ""she was shirtless"" is scandalous. ""He is an nurse and loves chick flicks"" incites judgement while ""she is an engineer and gamer"" raises doubts to her skills. The least harm that can be done is bringing up irrelevant information. ""She needs her toothbrush to brush her teeth."" Everyone needs to brush their teeth regardless of gender, the fact that the toothbrush belongs to a woman or is set in a woman's mouth does not need be brought up. There's something insidious about it, like if we always referenced a person's race, sexuality, or disability in sentences. 

However, if I did use they/them pronouns it would be clear appropriation from the non-binary and trans* communities, and not everyone agrees it should be done.

I'm afab, sometimes cool with he/him, occasionally cool with she/her, haven't really had a chance to try out they/them because my first language doesn't have gendered pronouns.

I have a cheap binder but thankfully my boobs aren't large. I wore the binder a couple of times and then stopped because generally if I don't think about it I forget my boobs are there. My chest is pretty flat so I can feel the flat space in between them and imagine I don't have boobs. Sometimes I wear baggier clothes to hide my chest, sometimes I wear tighter clothes and it's like the body I'm seeing isn't mine, but I don't get extremely upset like some people describe online, so I'm pretty confused.

I cut my hair short btw, even if I'm not feeling very masculine I never wish my hair was longer, it's like a pixie bob cut rn and I wish I could cut it shorter.

If I could change my body I'd generally want it to be more androgynous, but occasionally I feel like I don't want to give up my curves. Not opposed to the idea of taking testosterone, but I still haven't found the courage to bring up gender issues to my therapist (I go there for depression and anxiety, not sure if therapist is supportive of lgbt)

I hate my English birth name since it's feminine and just doesn't sound like me, so I picked a gender neutral name and told some friends. I like my new name but I keep feeling like their perception of me would change since they're probably used to using my feminine birth name.

Sometimes I think I know what my gender is when I wake up but once I corrected a friend who called me she/her and said I was he/him today, then when she changed to he/him I felt like those weren't my pronouns either, even though I felt masculine.

I feel masculine/feminine but I guess I very rarely identify as fully male/female. I don't feel like I don't have a gender. I have one but I don't know what it is. It's just my gender. I'm just me.

2020-11-08 14:40:35,jqcrok,2,1,"i'm autistic and have synaesthesia, and i find these impact the way i see gender and my own identity a lot. this has lead to me using a lot of lesser-known terms like xenogenders to describe my own gender, because it literally can't see or visualise it any other way. i mean, i present fairly masculine/androgynous, but this isn't really how i feel - my identity is just some confusing cloud of various feelings and concepts mashed together.

2020-11-08 15:22:23,jqde8h,1,1,"So I am NB, reaching that first year of knowing I am

And one of the main issues I have that give me dysphoria out the A are about my breasts and I guess ""period"" would be the correct name.

I had two children before I knew I was NB (by name, before I knew what it was) so my body did the whole big change, and now I have saggy boobs, a big butt, and alot more weight than I used to

My boobs are HELLA dysphoric for me, like I hate that they are there, they are almost 6x the size they were before having kids and the way they sag makes me hate my body more and more every time I see them, laying down they look like pancakes and it disgusts me

Regarding the period part. I am not ""fixed"" since I chickened out of getting my tubes tied with my last kid, and if I were to get pregnant again I may actually die or loose the baby cuz preeclampsia from the first kid was very bad. So we have enough kids and dont want more. And both are amazing and perfect in their individual ways  
My periods are consistently painful, only during the first 24-48 hours. I just cant do anything due to all the side effects. Headache, cramps, bloating, hot flashes, nausea, diarrhea, you get the picture  
Its incredibly dysphoric 

So my question, to those who are working on it, and or have had it done  
(And I know it may be more difficult with that disease running rampant)  
How hard is it to get top surgery or a hysterectomy? My husband seems to think that if its something I want then to just talk to the doc and they'll just do it??? (We all know thats not the case)  
What doc do you go to?  
I dont really want to go on HRT, I went on estrogen only birth control once and it made me angry ALL the time, so I'm scared of what HRT would do...  
Would a doctor even listen to me?

I would also like to point out that my husband is amazing and is pushing me to get these potential surgerys done if it would make me happy and he is in no way keeping me from being NB, and he loves that I finally know what I am

i came up with the name when i was out with a friend last night: andy/andie. and i think it suits me more than my actual names does since its not as feminine and more gender neutral. and i like it. at least i think i do.

2020-11-08 18:05:51,jqga9o,0,1,"Hi all! This is a sharing and question post. So I've been periodically, maybe a couple of times a year, stopping taking my HRT for a while, for like two to four weeks. I do this because of the uncertainty/ambivalence I still feel about ""how far"" I want to go with medically transitioning, to see how it feels off HRT compared to on. So far I've always decided to resume, and this time after two weeks I've again decided to resume. I'll say a little about what I notice and feel, in case anybody is curious and also because I wonder if other people (in particular amab nb people) share this kind of experience? The ambivalence motivating me here gives me ""impostor"" feels and worries me whether I'll ever get to certainty about what I want. For reference, I've been taking HRT for about a cumulative year now, across two calendar years. This is due both to taking my little breaks, and needing to pause for one longer period last year because of an unrelated medical issue.

The main thing I notice is how fast the changes I notice come when I go off HRT. First and most noticeable: my breasts have *vanished*. As you might guess I haven't had much breast development, otherwise I bet this wouldn't be happening. But I've gone from almost an A cup, or almost almost, to ""bee stings"". Even the nipples have shrunk closer to their size before HRT. On the one hand it's just kinda neat to do this shapeshifter trick in the mirror... but I do prefer having them to not. On the other hand I'd rather have small breasts, ideally just big enough to be recognizable as ""girl"" breasts when I have clothes on, and I know that's not something I can control if I do continue taking HRT indefinitely.

Also: eee-rrrec-tions! They're back! Spontaneous ones that is. I don't really have (much) genital dysphoria so this doesn't bother me, and they even feel nice. I have gotten used to the differences in how I experience arousal on HRT and how sex and masturbation feel different though, and I really like them. Frankly, ""male"" stimulation and orgasms are just... not as good. If for some reason I could only ever feel it in the off-HRT way it wouldn't be the end of the world, but I really like the on-HRT way better.

Also also: rapid fat redistribution, or un-redistribution. Especially around my hips and lower back, I revert to my skinny boy shaped factory setting. This I have mixed feelings about; the ""default"" body shape is familiar and makes sense, if that makes sense. On HRT my body's shape confuses me a little. ""In between, confusing"" is what I want in general but on-HRT it's like, does my body look like a ""trans body"" (or even a woman's body, if either term is even useful and un-transphobic) or do I just look like a skinny guy who's gaining weight? Can I have a shape that is more conventionally womanly? Ambivalence, more than the rest of these points kinda from the part of me that wonders if I'm mtf and not nb.

And like, my skin is a little bit grottier and less soft, which I definitely don't like.

He constantly struggles with his presentation and who he is on the inside versus how the world perceives him. Looking back on the play, it's gobsmackingly obvious why I loved it so much. At the time, I think I mostly just liked how dang *sad* Richard is.

Anyway, my favorite enby passage, as Richard tries to reckon with his identity after he has been stripped of his crown and freedom:  


&gt;Thus play I in one person many people,  
&gt;  
&gt;And none contented: sometimes am I king;

2020-11-12 18:52:58,jt0kaa,4,1,"I had a really strange interaction with a friend the other day and thought it would be interesting to share.

So I paid for my friend's lunch as her card wasn't working and she offered to paypal me the money. I declined saying it was okay, but she was insisting, so I had to tell her that I wasn't comfortable with doing it anyways because my birthname is registered on my account. This is where it gets... questionable?

She said ""It's okay, I already know your real name!"" 

And something about it just... rubbed me the wrong way. Like, the tone that she used was like ""you should be glad that I know and haven't said anything bc I'm a \*good person\*"" and that she was proud to know my 'terrible secret' and it just disregarded the fact that I didn't want her to see it? Teachers have been known to use the wrong name on occasion so maybe she heard it from them idk. It kind of came off like she was being a bit of a ""cis hero"", as I call it, and I should be thankful to her? Like regardless of whether she knows or not, people seeing my birthname gives me a lot of dysphoria and makes me extremely uncomfortable bc it's a reminder of the situation I'm in where I can't change my name, and I'm leading almost a double life and it's v stressful.

So basically I feel a strong desire and appropriateness to inhabit a very specific type of body and gender.

The problem is that's the type of gender I feel for myself. I want to be percieved as trans woman  -- not to be seen as a cis woman. Usually this type of gender although performing and living as female, it's also known they're not.

I was wondering where the distinction is between, ie. women who are in touch with their masculine side and don’t abide by gender norms and identify as female (ie don’t shave, short hair, masculine dressing) and non-binary people. 

A friend of mine who presents themselves as very feminine (aside from not shaving their armpits) and was assigned the sex of female at birth came out as non-binary.

*Does this request of ""they"" pronouns for people who visually seem to conform to their assigned sex invalidate or have detrimental effects on the non-binary community who are more gender fluid?* 

I’m totally not trying to invalidate their gender identity bc I know the point of non-binary is that there is a gender spectrum. However, I just wanted to have a better grasp on if non-binary is more distinguishing one's self from societal norms or if it is a kind of dissatisfaction with their assigned gender like for transpeople (who ik often subscribe to one gender which is a big distinction)?

I have a situation with my cis-bi(but woman leaning) man partner. I told him that I have bad bottom dysphoria. I don't mind toys touching me but being stimulated genitally(sometimes even seen down there) by another person(especially a cis person causes my dysphoria to go up) . I have discussed this with him and he understood. We have done stuff that we both enjoyed( or so I thought). 

However, in recent months, he has been asking me when I will get over my 'hang-up'. He has pointed out AFAB trans people that are comfortable with using their genitals or interracting with them. He has also shown me porn with trans men and cis men who are comfortable having PiV. I told him that I was happy for these people but I didn't feel the same. My partner said he wants me to go to therapy so and I quote 'be comfortable in my own skin and with my anatomy.' I am already in therapy(he knows this) but wants me to see a new therapist that will push me to being more 'body positive'. Honestly all this has me feeling very negatively and under pressure. I told him that. In response he said and I quote, ""I like people with vaginas no matter the gender. I accept your gender, so you have to accept the fact you are a female."" That kind of threw me off a bit. I told him that I would think about that and that I was glad for his honesty. I asked if he wasn't satisfied as we are doing now. He said he was happy with the sex we are having but felt like we should be having sex of a different sort due to our biology.

TMI: It is just that I have been made aware that he has been touching my genital area while I was sleeping. I only know this because I woke up when he was doing it( I take sleep medication so I usually am completely out but for some reason I wasn't that night).

So, I already know generally how to grow hair out, how often to trim it, general care, etc- however I am unsure what to do to make it look at least a LITTLE good while I try to get there. I am going from a very standard “manly” haircut, super short on the sides, hard part on the left side like pretty much every men’s hairstyle these days basically. But I am wondering if I can style it somehow, going from that, into something that looks good and if possible, maybe even more feminine with the length I do have (maybe 4-6 inches on top, and 1-2 inches on the sides now) the other thing is I bleached my hair and now only the tips are bleached. It doesn’t look too bad on top, but the sides look very messy and dirty because of the mix of bleached and natural color.

The goal with growing my hair out is to get a little more length on the top and then lots more on the side, I am aiming for a longer pixie cut, with more length on the sides than most other pixie cuts. Something to cover my face up a bit with, I guess.

So how can I style it, should I cut it differently in the meantime, and should I just cut off the bleached bits altogether? Those are my biggest questions.

2020-11-14 18:43:57,ju6w7s,6,1,"CW: I'm going to talk about medical care and sexual history

&amp;#x200B;

Hi friends!

I'm an MD student in the US and we've been learning the components of the medical interview. My school is FAN FUCKING TASTIC and I'm so happy that they teach us to start every clinical encounter by asking patients how they would like to be addressed and what pronouns they use! It's wholesome af.

Even though I'm non-binary and my school is training us to be inclusive, I still feel like I need more practice. Specifically, I'd like to work on sexual history taking using gender inclusive language. 

A ""sexual history"" entails asking a patient about their past and present sexual partners, use of protection, history of STI testing, potential abuse, etc. Sometimes (depending on if the doctor is concerned about STIs) it can get quite detailed, such as asking about the specific type or acts one is engaging in (ie: giving vs receiving anal sex, performing vs receiving oral sex, etc) and thus the anatomy of a patient's partners becomes relevant. For those who don't know, some STIs are more likely to be transmitted by certain sexual acts compared to others. For example, the odds of getting HIV from a positive partner is relatively high if you are receiving anal sex from that partner but relatively low if you are performing oral sex on that partner. (But always use protection anyway because the risk is still there!)

Anyway. I want to get really good at talking to patients about this sensitive stuff in a way that does not bring up gender dysphoria for my NB and GNC patients. Straight up asking ""what biological sex are you and your partners?"" feels like the wrong way to do it. I'm not sure if asking ""what anatomy do you have?"" or ""what anatomy does your partner have?"" is better. What feels okay for me as a NB person might not feel good for other people, so I thought I'd come here and ask.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm AFAB nonbinary. 

I get chest dysphoria some days (probably around half). 

I talked to my therapist and she said I need to make a pro con list of my options for my next steps: 

1- treat the dysphoria by getting a binder 
2- figure out if I have an underlying thing causing my dysphoria and treat that 

She also said I could do the first thing as a bandaid until I figure out the underlying cause. 

So what do I do? Does someone else have an experience like this? Any advice or input ?

1955- Gigi Raven Wilbur. They were born intersex but forced male. They think intersex was the correct way for them to be born. They are a writer and activist.

1849- We'wha, from Zuni. They were an artist, educator, farmer and diplomat.

1603- Thomas/Thomasine Hall. They were also born intersex and would dress as both a man and a woman. They were a servant and a soldier.

1752- 'Public Universal Friend's aka someone who wanted no pronouns and just want to be a good human. 

1894- Claude Cahun. They wrote explicitly about sometimes feeling masculine and sometimes feminine but always 'Neuter'. They were an artist during the surreal movement and was actively a resistance member in WWII.

1760- Jens Andersson. A trans masc bigender person. They married a woman (as a male) and when asked if he was a man or a woman the answer was pretty much ""he says yes. He's both""

2020-11-15 23:22:35,juvv33,4,4,"So I work with kids in an acute care facility.  We get a lot of trans and queer kids, a lot ask about how I identify.  Many ask my pronouns.  I let my kids know when I first changed my name why I changed my name (and in emergencies use my dead name because I might not immediately respond).  The kids told my coworker how much they appreciated me being open about my name change.  If a kid tells me their LGBT, I say, “really?  Me too!”  They know I’m a safe space for that and I won’t judge them.

I had a kid ask how to come out to their parents as nonbinary.  That same day I had come out to my mom.  I told them they need to be sure they’re safe first, I just came out to my mom and I wrote her a letter, sent it via text, and went into work.  That’s what I found to give the least anxiety, and to come out you kind of just have to do it.  ^(I’m not a therapist, so I can only give advice based on my experiences, and this seems the best way in my position.)

I don’t want to lie to them, but I don’t want to give them the hard truth either, so that’s how I circumvented that.

Well, lead told my supervisor something (I assume that I told kids I came out and that I talk about my sexuality).  I don’t know what, but his response was I shouldn’t tell the kids about my *sexuality*.

Then he kept using my dead name.

This was after I asked if I could get my name changed to Lee.

Found out he calls my (female) coworkers girlfriend “whoever you live with.”

I have read a lot of low dose (aka microdosing) testosterone posts from this page and others, but I haven’t seen any that mention taking doses under 25mg per day. 

I have been out as non-binary for 3-4 years now and I took the leap to get T last month. I am AFAB, and had 3.5 pg/mL of free testosterone and 18 ng/dL of total testosterone during my pre T test readings. 

I asked to start T by being in the upper range of “female” readings and was prescribed 12.5mg per day of T. This is a half packet of the 25mg gel each day on my upper back. 

I only started last week and there isn’t anything to report as it’s way too soon - especially for super low doses like mine - but I wanted folks to know that asking to be in the “upper T range for females” is an option! 

I’ll be sure to update this post around February after my next checkup and blood tests. I may increase dosage to 25mg and I’ll update about that as well. 

Questions for the community: I see a lot of folks say low doses (like 25mg/day) cause the same changes as full dose T but just slower. Do you think this is the case for doses as low as mine as well? I am thinking that it might not cause the changes other see since I would still be within “female range” but I wasn’t sure.

Our project, Queering the Binary, will explore non-binary identities, culture, history, and experiences. We are gathering data on non-binary topics and would love if you could take our survey to let us know about your experience being non-binary. The link is: [bit.ly/QueeringDoc](https://bit.ly/QueeringDoc)

We would really appreciate your participation and also would love if you could share our survey with your non-binary friends. Thank you!

**Here are more details about our survey:**

**To be eligible to participate you must identify as non-binary, be 18+ years old, and English-speaking.** **All countries are welcome. The survey is confidential and all data will be reported in aggregate form.** If you indicate you are interested in being interviewed for the docuseries, your email address will be associated with your responses so you can be contacted.

The purpose of this research study is to investigate the life experiences of non-binary individuals. Having current, relevant data about non-binary people will add to the limited, but existing literature and resources on non-binary people.

The Queering the Binary research survey asks questions about the following topics: demographics, gender identity, sexual orientation, romantic attraction labels, relationships, culture, being out, bullying, mental health, transitioning, and gender dysphoria/euphoria. It takes approximately 20 minutes to complete.

To thank you for participating, we’ll send you an advanced screening link of the first episode.

I also am comfortable with longish hair and my sweet or effeminate tendencies, that are nowhere near those of fully comfortable transmen or some effeminate gay cis men, I am less glittery than that but still I had to work to accept myself as soft and somewhat delicate on occasions.

I have a lot of very important moments of gender euphoria, like feeling really myself in menswear, reading my body reassuringly as male (it's just arranged differently!) and my sexuality is that of a gay man and nothing else. I also feel hurt when I am misgendered or expected to be a woman in a social situation. I have dysphoria when I try to wear women's clothes because they are more normal or better fitting. I also feel very panicky and sick when people tell me that I don't look like a man, because the mirror tell me that I look like a fat man with things in the wrong place, but a guy. I hate it bitterly when people deduce that I have no dysphoria because I don't want hormone/surgeries.

Having said that... I also fattened up in the moment I came out to myself fully, before it was a thing in the back of my mind like an open secret inside myself, but I started hating my body and eating like a pig after coming out. Before that I was lean and very accepting of my body, because I never saw it as girly or womanly. I wanted a flatter chest and leaner legs, but I was not waging a war against my body or seeing it as a problem, and I loved my long hair. I didn't saw a contradiction with my gender.

Now sometimes I have moments when I just want comfort, like a flowery blanket or a sweet fragrance, it's like a macho endeavour this thing of being a man, living like I have to justify everything and be careful about everything (especially feminine things) and having to always thing how it comes off. I swear that I used to be confident and thinking of myself as good looking, relaxed, natural. I don't want short hair, but I want a man who loves me as a man. I want my body as is, ideally flat but no modifications and I want to be sexy exactly that way.

I also feel guilty because sometimes I don't get upset if family members use the feminine pronouns or I use them inside my head especially if talking about my youth. Now I want to go on a diet and become lean and slender and lithe again and I wonder if is this thing of coming out as a transman that made me become fat.

I have tried labels of androgyne and transmasculine but I feel too erased in my manhood with this. I would give up everything to be comfortable with myself again. Is like I lived in my head as a man for all my life and everything went south the moment I was a man also outside of my head. I don't want to be anything else but my goodness I am exhausted and sick of this self-checking and self-policing and feeling incompatible with myself when before I was not.

2020-11-17 02:31:35,jvkss8,23,9,"I love the nonbinary community (at least here online, that's all I have experience with), but find that I feel easily alienated from it because I don't meet a lot of the sterotypes associated with being Nonbinary (especially afab Nonbinary). I wasn't a tomboy growing up, I don't dislike femininity, I don't want top surgery or T, and even if I feel more free to pursue androgyny now, it's not all I want or something that really defines me. I'm never going to be the person who others gender correctly on the first try just by looking at me because I don't look 'confusing' or ambigious, I look like a bald woman. I also don't really align with being masc or fem either - I just don't feel aligned with anything and actually kind of dislike describing myself using masc, fem, or andro, it all feels very attached to the binary and just not how I see myself (i'm agender, so I don't really factor gender into how I see myself, at least not in a traditional sense). 

All this can make me feel often invalidated and insecure in nonbinary spaces. I know i'm nonbinary, so i'm no longer in the panic of questioning, but I still feel very invisible and alienated. Not like binary people because I don't get the whole man/woman thing, but not like nonbinary people because I don't present or strive towards what sometimes feels like an ideal based around the idea that we are a third gender spawned from the other two. And of course there's nothing wrong with wanting to look androgynous, and not all of it stems from the idea that we are a 'third gender' at all, but sometimes it feels like the community just pays lip service to the whole 'not all enbies are androgynous' thing and then continues to place that ideal on the pedestal. I see it in how often people even in this community use 'nonbinary' as a stand in for 'gender neutral' when they're looking for names, or talking about reasons why they're questioning why they are or aren't nonbinary. And I so rarely see nonbinary people who aren't thin, white and androgynous. So, if you relate to any of what i'm saying, or otherwise feel alienated from the community in any way, how do you cope with it? And with the internalised transphobia that comes with that? How do you create connection to the community and your nonbinariness again? 

TLDR; I don't fit many of the stereotypes associated with being or having grown up afab nonbinary - not andro, a tomboy, or disliking femininity - and often feel alienated from the community because I don't prioritize androgyny in the same way so much of it does. I look like a woman to most. I also don't feel connected to the label 'fem nonbinary person' either, I just exist and in a lot of ways masc, fem, andro are meaningless words when describing my experience.

2020-11-17 03:20:30,jvlkc7,20,3,"Hey everyone. I'm a 29-year-old transmasc nonbinary person, afab, with a very, very feminine name. Like this is a VERY girly name and I've never liked it. It literally can not be shortened to anything resembling a nickname PERIOD, gender neutral or not. It just can't. It's an annoying, inflexible, girly name that I hate and it doesn't even sound good with my last name either. My whole name just sucks.

Anyway. I only came out as nonbinary about three years ago to close friends, then publicly (I have quite a few followers on Twitter because of the work I do) about a year ago, but I think because I have such a girly name and I'm not that open about my gender (which I consider a pretty private part of me), most people probably don't even recognize me the way I want to be seen. I really believe that changing my name would help me fully take control of who I am and my image, personally and publicly.

The problem is I just don't know how to go about it. Not at all. I feel too old. I'm almost 30. People know my name. If I changed my name, it would essentially be slapping a deadname on my entire public portfolio. People might get confused and not know who I am and I might lose some of the following I've worked so hard for. That sounds stupid, but a lot of my job depends on this public-facing element, and it just seems like it'd be such a hassle to ask people to start calling me something completely different and have to deal with all my old work being mislabeled.

I'm also just worried that I won't like whatever name I pick and might want to go back on it after going through the trouble of telling people my new name. Then I'd be starting that whole cycle over. And what if I do it AGAIN? I'm so indecisive and I can't think of a name that would suit me! I've tried pulling anagrams of my name but none of them work. I've tried thinking of similar-sounding names to mine that are gender neutral, because I feel like if I'm going to change my name I should do something that has a ""precedent"" if that makes sense, so something that sounds similar to mine or ""make sense"" that I'd change it to. A bunch of people I know who are nonbinary just shorten their existing name and it just fucking WORKS. Mine can't do that. I also don't want a crazy-sounding or extremely unusual or unique name. I just want something that isn't so completely feminine. I also can't go by my middle name because it's my cousin's name which would be weird and I can't go by my last name for a few reasons I don't want to explain, just believe me.

HELP. I feel like this one thing is holding me back from so much in my life. I don't want to start new projects with my name on it because it would just be ""one more thing"" for me to have to scrub my old name from if I ever choose to change it. But I also can't figure out a new name that suits me or give myself permission to just do it. I'm so lost. I've brought this up to my friends and my partner (who is a cis male) and they all say they ""like"" my name, which doesn't help me. It just makes me feel like I shouldn't change it because everyone else is ""fine with it"" and I'm being difficult by not being fine with it too.

I hate that I was born in the '90s, when I didn't have all this vocabulary to describe my gender dysphoria and identity. I would have been able to shape my identity growing up and wouldn't have to make these huge changes when I'm 30 and have a career and people who've known me for decades as a version of myself that I honestly fucking hate.

I know she has feelings about losing parts of her body in ways that are traumatic.
And so I'm very hesitant to bring up wanting to have that done willingly--paying to do it. The one time I broached the subject, she cried in public.

I've only used GC2B which flattens really well but is so uncomfortable I can only actually wear it on days that I'm feeling really well in my body ( I have a disc disorder) which is rare. So I deal with pretty bad dysphoria due to my chest on a pretty frequent basis. For reference, I'm 5'9"", 165 lbs and have a chest size of 36-38 E or F or G (?? I could never get the hang of bras😣)
The GC2B binder leaves a huge gap between the bottom of my chest and my rib cage when i wear the XL and my chest moves around underneath it a lot during the day and requires constant adjustment.. even with it not being tight enough to bind correctly it still puts a lot of pressure on my chest and makes it hard to breathe on most days.   But it is SO tight when I wear the L that it is painful and uncomfortable, although if I can manage it, it alleviates a lot of dysphoria.

I like to wear crop tops a lot, so the shorter style binder is preferable. Does anyone have experience with the kind that have velcro? Or zippers? Or clasps?

2020-11-17 23:42:33,jw4hlv,2,3,"So recently I've been questioning my gender. Previously I've identified as a cis woman, but the past few weeks I've been trying to untangle my feelings about my gender. People told me I was a girl and I assumed that was that, even with being in the LGBTQ+ community since I came out as gay in middle school and ace/aro spec freshman year of high school. I've felt comfortable in these labels of sexuality, but I never allowed myself to think about being anything but cis. I think my parents played into that. Not that they're not accepting of trans people in general, but they have said offhandedly that they are glad that none of their kids are trans and they don't know how they'd handle that. I guess I've been subconsciously scared of them saying it was a phase and dismissing it, or of inconveniencing them any further than I already have with my shitty history of mental health, including undiagnosed but likely (my therapist referred me but it's so expensive to get tested) autism.

But a little while ago I looked in the mirror and smoothed down my chest and something clicked that I didn't know was really there. I didn't like my boobs. I guess a lot of people don't like them but I realized I never really felt connected to them, or my genitalia either. I never felt like they were me, like they were mine. And like with so many other things, I thought this was normal. But apparently feeling connected to your body is the normal thing.

And the longer I thought about it, the more I hated my appearance. I had been wanting to cut my hair short and androgynous since middle school, and now my hair is so long that it feels like it's suffocating me. And I bought a binder a week ago. It came in today and I liked it. I liked feeling flat. It wasn't perfect, but it made me feel solid, I guess. And even so it's not like I don't want boobs. I'm okay with having them I guess. I just like it without too?

As a kid I was always a tomboy. I forced myself to be girly as I matured, and it never felt right. But now I always dress in things like sweats or jeans and button downs (Hawaiian shirts especially) and it makes me happy. Even looking at my Pinterest boards, I never had any dresses on there, just androgynous stuff. I like it. It makes me feel confident and happy.

I guess I just feel like I don't fit into being a woman 100%, but also I don't fit as a man at all? Non-binary seems right but I'm scared. I don't know how pronouns feel because I haven't had the balls to ask anyone to refer to me by they/them. I'm fine with my name. It's feminine but it's mine.

I have a wonderful partner that I am so in love with (our one year anniversary is actually tomorrow) and she is supportive of whatever I identify as, but even that acceptance is scary.

During the time I ided as demi, I decided to go by the name Remi as opposed to my birthname, because it sounds like a cute neutral name and I kept with it.

They were confused and I told them it's a nickname I go on by online and majority of my friends call me that name now too. After telling them it was a nickname, I told them I would like if they started calling me that instead of my birthname and I even added in saying if I had the money to legally change my name, I'd change it to Remi. My mom got angry at me because she thought I was joking when I wasnt. She told me Remi sounded like a ""boy's name"".

The goal is to provide one full day outfit (tops, bottoms, and socks) and one set of pajamas to trans people (more specifically minors, but adults are more than welcomed too!) who otherwise cannot afford to begin a new wardrobe or wouldn't be able to have access to such items because of their family situation. Each package works on a $100ish budget, so any additional requests that are made after what's already promised will be squeezed into there as much as possible.

Binders ARE an option, and will be guaranteed to be in the packages if requested, even if it goes a bit over budget. Same for bras. The only clothes I'm currently not willing to include is underwear, as I don't exactly feel comfortable picking that out for strangers, let alone minors. BUT everything else is fair game (you can even request shoes, makeup, or anything you can think of!).

I've already planned ahead for safety concerns, so please don't be afraid to request one if your situation's a more closeted one. You can request your items to be shipped within a backpack or other nondescript item for concealment, and chose how much pride items can be included, what the name is on the shipping label, etc. I want this to be accessible to as many people as possible!

I am accepting donations, but I've designed this to be able to be done out of my own pocket, so please don't feel pressured to do so. For now, I'm taking in request forms for the next month or so, and will begin fulfilling them at the start of January 2021 at the very latest.

Despite having they/she listed as her pronouns, she said she approached us to let us know she doesn’t use feminine words such as lady/woman and asked we not use those words when reaching out to her. She seemed really offended. What is making it even harder for me, is she also said she doesn’t have the bandwidth to deal with conversations about this.

2020-11-19 06:54:02,jwxzos,13,6,"Title! I’m currently living as a cis butch lesbian (she/her), who presents in a very masculine way. Obviously, me being masculine as an afab person wasn’t easy to come to terms with. There was a period of my life, about 2 years, when I was out as a trans man to everyone in my life— my school, work, etc, and I was even stealth in some places. People used he/him for me, and I went by another name. Everyone I met for the first time after transitioning automatically gendered me as male. I even went on t for a little, but have no permanent affects. I was diagnosed with gender dysphoria 3 times. 


For a while, I lived happily as a cis butch lesbian, believing my diagnoses to have been misdiagnoses. I’ve used she/her, and my birth name. This worked for a while. But now, I’m not so sure. I spent a lot of quarantine questioning my gender, and haven’t come to any conclusions since.


The logical conclusion might be that I’m non binary. Neither binary gender has made me feel fulfilled and euphoric. So why should I  keep identifying as one when there are other options (such as non binary genders). For some reason, I just won’t let myself identify as non binary— I don’t know if I’m just a cis woman going through a bit of a gender crisis, or if they/them would make me happy, or what. My friends have offered to use they/them for me (theyre all very understanding and I don’t think anyone in my life would cast me out for being non binary if that’s what I am), but I’ve always declined. It felt wrong, for some reason. 


I do plan on getting top surgery soon, regardless of how I identify. Even if I’m a cis woman, I don’t want these things. So I guess my question is, has anyone felt the same? A sort of internal resistance to the non binary label? An unwillingness to identify as it? Might it be internalized enbyphobia? I firmly believe enbies are valid and I’ll die on that hill for any of my enby friends and you folks, but it feels like something might be in my way.


Has anyone else felt this? If so, how’d you get through it, whatever you ended up identifying as?


TL;DR: I’ve publicly identified as male and female. Neither has made me happy, so logically, it might make sense that I’m non binary, but I for some reason won’t let myself identify that way.

Two years ago, I sat with my group of friends during lunch every day. It was me, three girls, and about six or so guys. There was also this kid (we’ll call him Marvin) who sat with us too. My friends and I knew *of* him, but none of us would consider ourselves actual friends with him. Marvin was very quiet. He just sat there and ate his food.

One day, the girls in my friend group told the rest of us that Marvin was looking at them in... ways and just generally making them very uncomfortable. So we all discussed what to do about him. During that conversation, I tried to weigh into it, basically taking the stance of “I’m all for kicking him out, but just,, be civil about it.” Then one of the girls said “No offense, but this is *our* [her and the other girls] problem.” 

The plan that was made was to perform an experiment. We would have the girls sit on one side and the boys sit on the other. Then when Marvin showed up (he was always a little late to lunch), we would take note of who who he chose to sit by. One of the girls drew up a whole seating chart for lunch that day, and I was placed on the boy’s side of the table. I was undeniably on the boy’s side of the table too: the seating order was the three girls, then one of the boys, then me.

Im struggling with my gender identity quite a bit and I have nobody to talk to about this, so I figured Id ask here. If this is the wrong sub for this question please correct me.

I am female but on the inside, I have always felt half man half woman. I am both masculine and feminine, but I have always felt closer to the masculine side of me. I never felt comfortable with the label woman because it just feels incomplete to me. So a few months ago, I asked my closest friends to reffer to me in male pronouns and it feels so good and natural. Basically I realized that I wanna be seen and reffered to as a man, a he.  

But heres the catch. I love my female body and I have no desire to change it. I have the typical hourglass marilyn monroe busty figure and I love it. Only sometimes it makes me sad that I dont have a penis, because I hate periods and everything related to female reproductive system.

So I dont really know what to call myself, what label to put on myself, or even If there is a label for this? I am completely comfortable looking female, I dont want to transition or change my body, but I still want to be seen as a man, I want to be called ""sir"" and ""mr"" and ""he"", because that how I feel on the inside.

2020-11-20 01:26:21,jxfs38,6,1,"Hey everyone, I'm writing this in the hope that some of you will share your opinions on what gender label best describes me. I know ultimately it's up to me to define myself, but I'm really just seeking help with applying the terminology given my situation, desires, aversions... and just who I am. 

I'm almost 24 now, and biologically, genetically female. When I was about 18 I began to feel a solid conviction that I was not of the gender ""female."" I began identifying as nonbinary and came out to close friends, my immediate family, and my extended family about it. Initially, I felt a huge disconnect between myself and my breasts, hips, and body fat distribution. I began exclusively dressing in a ""unisex"" style of clothing that leaned more towards masculine than feminine. I sought LGBT counseling to explore the notion of transitioning - i.e. getting top surgery. I never wanted to go on testosterone or to cause my body to have distinctly male characteristics. 

My counselor validated my identity and was willing to write a letter affirming my gender identity and dysphoria, and provided me with resources to move forward with top surgery. I never ended up having this procedure done. Part of it was intimidation about the cost, the health risks, things that could possibly go wrong. Part of it was, to be honest, a reluctance to be rid of my breasts because sometimes I liked how they looked in the mirror, and I just didn't feel confident enough about having no tissue there at all to move forward with top surgery.

A few months shy of my 23rd birthday, I realized I definitely did NOT want a flat chest. I hadn't been actively pursuing it, but self-discoveries fell into place in such a way that I had a tipping point of clarity. Around the same time, my dysphoria about my body fat distribution and hips began to lessen. I more recently realized that men who aren't overweight tend to have particularly sinewy legs, and I realized I actually prefer having a more feminine shape to my body. I'd be incredibly dysphoric if I had the body of Kim Kardashian (no shame, it's just not what I prefer for myself), but I don't desire to get rid of all my curves or the softness of my body (granted, I'm thin... but still biologically female, so hormones have an influence). 

After turning 23 I, as I continued my process of self-discovery, I realized that I'm childfree. It's similar to a gender identity or sexual orientation for me because it's something pretty fundamental to who I am and not something that's likely to change over the course of my life. I also became more aware of what it means to bear children, and with this awareness came more self-discovery about how much I never want to be pregnant, give birth, or breastfeed. I don't want a human growing inside my body and the health risks and bodily trauma that come with childbirth completely turn me off. While I'd be remiss to say a woman who doesn't want to be a mother or bear children isn't a ""real woman,"" I've been wondering if perhaps my desire to remain nulliparous (never bearing children) is one piece of evidence for why I'm not a cis woman. 

My period annoys me. I'm grateful that my reproductive organs are free of any diseases, but I have absolutely no need to have a period and it strikes me as redundant, unnecessary, and a waste of time and energy to continue menstruating until menopause. I fantasize about having a hysterectomy - not just to be free of periods, but because I would feel my body more accurately reflects my internal essence without a uterus. That's another trait that makes me wonder if maybe I'm not cis... although I imagine many cis women are annoyed by and resent their periods. 

So as of right now, I don't want a flat chest. I don't feel euphoric about having mammary glands... while I want some volume up there, I feel similarly about my lobes and milk ducts to the way I feel about my uterus. I'd say my chest is a 32A/34A/32B. I wouldn't want it any larger as I feel it would be unnecessary and just inconvenient, not to mention in excess of my personal bodily aesthetic. If I could have the milk-producing parts of my breasts removed without having the fat liposuctioned out (so that I still have breasts even if they're a little smaller than they are currently), I'd seriously consider that. 

I don't feel particularly masculine. Right now I'm thinking maybe I fall somewhere between gender-neutral and cis female. As far as my wardrobe goes, I now feel drawn to wearing more feminine clothing, but I think I might by sort of overcorrecting since dressing exclusively androgynously for the past few years wasn't quite ""me."" At the moment I'm kind of sick of cultivating an androgynous appearance and want to present more feminine. 

As for pronouns, I'd say I couldn't care less (I don't worry about being misgendered), but for the sake of smooth social interactions I prefer she/her just because I look like a she/her, and they/them can be confusing as it's often plural. 

I recently came across the label ""demigirl."" Does that refer to a nonbinary individual who is feminine-of-center? I'm hesitant to dis-identify as a cis woman just because I don't conform (i.e. I don't want to bear children), but I'm wondering if there's more than gender-noncomformity at work since I have such a recurring fantasy and desire to be uterus-free and essentially have a body that doesn't support another human's development and nourishment - in the same way that a man's body does not. Additionally, I've been considering that maybe there is such a thing as a ""feminine"" or ""masculine"" essence - maybe spiritual, maybe neurological, I don't know - in which case, I'd say I'm more feminine than masculine.",NonBinary,Request for help figuring out my gender identity,1605860781.0,"{'created_utc': 1605835581, 'id': 'jxfs38', 'num_comments': 6, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Hey everyone, I\'m writing this in the hope that some of you will share your opinions on what gender label best describes me.

I\'d say my chest is a 32A/34A/32B. I wouldn\'t want it any larger as I feel it would be unnecessary and just inconvenient, not to mention in excess of my personal bodily aesthetic. If I could have the milk-producing parts of my breasts removed without having the fat liposuctioned out (so that I still have breasts even if they\'re a little smaller than they are currently), I\'d seriously consider that. \n\nI don\'t feel particularly masculine. Right now I\'m thinking maybe I fall somewhere between gender-neutral and cis female. As far as my wardrobe goes, I now feel drawn to wearing more feminine clothing, but I think I might by sort of overcorrecting since dressing exclusively androgynously for the past few years wasn\'t quite ""me."" At the moment I\'m kind of sick of cultivating an androgynous appearance and want to present more feminine. \n\nAs for pronouns, I\'d say I couldn\'t care less (I don\'t worry about being misgendered), but for the sake of smooth social interactions I prefer she/her just because I look like a she/her, and they/them can be confusing as it\'s often plural. \n\nI recently came across the label ""demigirl."" Does that refer to a nonbinary individual who is feminine-of-center? I\'m hesitant to dis-identify as a cis woman just because I don\'t conform (i.e. I don\'t want to bear children), but I\'m wondering if there\'s more than gender-noncomformity at work since I have such a recurring fantasy and desire to be uterus-free and essentially have a body that doesn\'t support another human\'s development and nourishment - in the same way that a man\'s body does not. Additionally, I\'ve been considering that maybe there is such a thing as a ""feminine"" or ""masculine"" essence - maybe spiritual, maybe neurological, I don\'t know - in which case, I\'d say I\'m more feminine than masculine.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Request for help figuring out my gender identity', 'created': 1605860781.0}"

2020-11-20 18:12:45,jxu8xg,0,1,"Researchers at the University of North Carolina, Greensboro would like to invite you to participate in a survey for a research study about genetic counseling for members of the LGBTQ+ community. Anyone who is a member of the LGBTQ+ community who has attended a genetic counseling session for themselves, a partner, a family member, or a child are eligible to participate.  The link to the survey is here: 

Survey link: [https://uncg.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_6PZad2awARlBQj3](https://uncg.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6PZad2awARlBQj3) 

&amp;#x200B;

This survey will take most participants approximately 20 minutes to complete. Your participation in this survey is completely voluntary. There are no direct benefits to participating in the study, though there may be future indirect benefits through contribution of knowledge around counseling the LGBTQ+ population.  There will be an opportunity to enter into a drawing for ten(10) twenty dollar ($20) gift cards for LGBTQ+ survey participants. There is minimal risk associated with taking the survey. You may feel uncomfortable answering some questions. Once you click the link to begin the survey, you may exit the survey at any time. We plan to publish the results, but do not plan to otherwise share the results with participants. The responses in the study are completely anonymous and cannot be traced back to you. By completing the survey, you are agreeing to participate in the study. Thank you for your time and consideration. Your participation is greatly appreciated. If you have any questions regarding this survey, please contact Rozalia Valentine at [ravalen2@uncg.edu](mailto:ravalen2@uncg.edu) .

Basically I don't want to do medical interventions but diet and workout to get an androgynous body, I really have dysphoria but THIS is the kind of dysphoria that I have, not the one that makes hormones/surgeries appealing. People say that I am not a man because I don't want to PROVE IT with hormones and surgeries.

Having failed at that, I have a somewhat effeminate streak. I can be masculine a lot, I have been told that they assumed I was a lesbian because I'm not feminine and dress neutral, but while I wear menswear only I also have a love for makeup when going out at night and I love soft, dainty things and hot pants, and sometime I giggle, and I also have long hair. Of course every one of this things makes people believe that I am faking it when I say that I am a man. People also hammer on the fact that having refused to prove that I am a man with medical interventions I am also doing womanly things like the hair to the shoulders, etc, so I really should stop pretending it. The point is that I hate everything macho, in men and women alike.

And finally I like guys, which is what people think is the last nail in the coffin, basically with all of this I am a girl.

I'm serene, have a good life, don't need much more or much less than everyone else.

•Diamoric - any attraction (sexual/romantic/platonic) involving at least one nonbinary person (i.e. nblw, mlnb, nblnb, etc.)

That one technically applies to all enbies, so next are the more specific ones. First for lady lovers:

•Trixic - nblw, for nonbinary people who attracted to women (sexual/romantic/platonic) 

•Gynesexual/romantic - attraction to femininity regardless of gender 

•Finsexual/romantic - attraction to women and feminine leaning nonbinary people

•Womasexual/romantic - attraction to women

And now for the men lovers:

•Toric - nblm, for nonbinary people who are attracted to men (sexual/romantic/platonic) 

•Androsexual/romantic - attraction to masculinity regardless of gender 

•Minsexual/romantic - attraction to men and masculine leaning nonbinary people

•Masexual/romantic - attraction to men

And lastly fellow for lovers of their fellow enbies:

•Enbian - nblnb, for nonbinary people who are attracted to nonbinary people 

•Ninsexual/romantic- attraction to nonbinary or otherwise neutral people

•Skoliosexual/romantic- attraction to nonbinary people (and/or technically anyone who isn’t cisgender)

so a person i knew from high school started an argument with me about trump a few days before the election, he got upset when i argued back, and searched for my twitter (which i purposely don't let irls have access to) and then took screenshots of me venting about him being stupid and sent them back to me. this happened to be a few days after i came out as enby and i had that tweet as my pinned just so new followers/mutuals who missed it would know, since i wasn't planning on putting it my bio.

of course i panicked, changed my username and made sure i removed my twitter links from everywhere he could possibly find it, and blocked him on both his accounts that i found. and that was a huge terrifying thing, but he had told me ""i'm not going to talk about your business and our private conversations because i'm mature unlike you,"" (fuck i hate him so much) so i figured okay, maybe, MAYBE he isn't going to tell people i'm enby, or maybe he didn't even notice???

i was wrong.

about twenty minutes ago one of my irls - the only irl ive trusted so far with this secret, actually, and the only irl who follows me on twt - messaged me and let me know that someone i used to be friends with told them that they found out i'm nonbinary. and guess who they heard that from?? nope, not from the trumpie himself, but from a DIFFERENT person that the trumpie told!!!!!!!

so needless to say i'm panicking and im scared, im so so scared. i'm barely in my first year of college, if this comes around to my parents i'll either be kicked out or be subjected to terrible terrible terrible talks about why it's a sin and just - this happened to me in freshman year (except i was outed as queer, i didnt know i was enby back then) and im so scared, i dont know what im going to do, i dont want to go thruogh all that again because it was legititmately traumatiizing and im so terrified oh mygod

i had just been waiting, i only have a few more years befoer i might be able to move out and live with my girlfriend and then i wont be as scared of my family finding out bc worst case scenario they react badly and then i just never talk to them again and find a new family right?????? but omfg im stuck here, it's quarantine and i see my family every day and i'll not have anywehre to go and im so scared

i want to text him and tell him to fuck himself and ask him if he legitimately is that stupid where something as important and life-threatening for me could just be treated as a silly little piece of gossip but i also feel like i should just block him on everything and pretend like he never existed and scribble over all his pictures with sharpie in my yearbook and i just need help and i need someone to tell me i'll be okay and that i'm not brokenad n i dont know im just so scared pleaseosm body helpme

2020-11-21 14:00:01,jyb6gs,1,1,"Hi! I've been wanting to cut my hair short for a really long time, and for it to appear gender neutral. I'm on mobile so sorry if formatting is iffy, I did my best.

My current haircut is a short bob (lord farquaad haircut- idk how i feel about it since i'm gonna dye my hair black soon but it is what it is) and I want to go for something way shorter, kind of like what Chloe Moriondo had when she had shorter hair. 

Does anyone have any advice as to how to cut it that way / how to get a hairdresser to do it right? I've been doing my hair (cutting &amp; dyeing) by myself since early 2019 and i really don't like going to hairdressers, but my friends have told me I should go to a professional for sth like this. 

The one friend that i'm out to told me that a fade on the sides would look good, but when those grow out (which they do super fast), it looks like a karen haircut and I can't afford going to the hairdresser that often. 

Should I get it the way Chloe Moriondo used to have it? Does anyone have any other ideas, or knows how to cut it that way?

When my mom corrects herself, my dad repeats her correction in a mocking tone. That's fucked. That's transphobic. And he has the audacity to turn around and say he's supportive?? that he loves me?

So, I wanted to ask my fellow AMAB queens about microdosing HRT. In fact, I'm not even sure if I should go for microdosing or full-on spiro and estradiol. I'm 20, and I look pretty feminine already, almost nothing grows on my face and random people already address me correctly (I live in a country where verb forms are gender-dependent, it's a Slavic country and I use she/her pronouns).

Sooo, I'm gonna ask if I should take spiro at all, since my T levels seem to be pretty low considering my appearance. I'm also almost severely underweight (BMI of 14.71), so will HRT make it worse or better? Have any of you noticed any change in appetite?

I recently starting coming out as genderfluid/genderqueer. I'm AFAB and identify basically in a ""yes, and"" way (yes, woman, and also nonbinary).

I don't *hate* my birth name (Emily). But it doesn't feel like it fits anymore. It's about 50% a gendered thing. The other 50% is a negative association thing (I was an fundamentalist Christian cult member until age 17/18). Basically, it's like ""Emily"" was a past me, but not me anymore.

I think I want to change my name, for both gender and other life reasons. If I do, I'll be keeping my existing middle name, and I'll wait until I get married to actually make the legal changes (hope to get married in 2023 and take his last name). So just looking at social/online/general use right now.

I've been going by my nickname ""Em"" online and in some other contexts lately. To my nephew and expected niece, I am/will be ""Auntie Em."" But ""Em"" doesn't feel like a real full name, just a nickname.

I'm fond of the name Emery. I feel like ""Em"" is still really me and I want to keep that part. But I'm concerned that people will (1) question why bother changing my name if it's so similar anyway, and (2) more importantly, be confused/mixed up more trying to use a new name that looks and sounds so similar to the old one.

Changing pronouns isn't part of this equation. I'm equally fine with she or they. It's just the name I want to change.

2020-11-22 16:09:14,jyy3b6,1,1,"Hello Reddit community, I am posting in multiple threads to get opinion of fellow trans friends. I am 37 years old male, father of two beautiful kids age 4 and 9. I am the only bread earner in the family. I love my kids. My wife is bit dominant in nature but overall she is loyal partner. I love kids and they love me. I want to be a good parent. I have stable job. Given my circumstances I think I can't fully transition. I want to know, how much possible it will be to have ""little bit transition""? What I mean by ""little bit"" I take  hrt hormones for some months and then quit and stay on and off keep mild changes. With this partial transition I am hoping to keep masculine look overall but have some inner emotional changes and also whole body experience in sexual relationship. I am hoping I could keep 3 to 4 times a month penetrative sex. My wife isn't in sex much part of the reason is size of my penis which is just 2.75"" erected. Erection never really hard. This incomplete erection never let her enjoy sex but neither of us has the plan to leave each other. My body is unusually soft and she always mention that I don't have masculine hardness in psychique. However, I don't want to tell her about this partial transition. 

I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety previously. I was on anxiety med acilotalpram for eight months but it didn't help much. I quit anti-depressant. My family doctor suggested I should see a psychologist but unfortunately my employer doesn't offer health benefits that's why I can't see psychologist using money from pocket at the moment. 

I have been thinking about transition since 2016 but I have reached to conclusion that with family responsbilities, I can't fully achieve this dream :( I wish I could! I wanna know how much changes 3 to 4 months harmones therapy on/off can bring. I usually don't shave beard for a week or two. Whenever we have sex, we have in dark or semi dark environment.

So here’s the Cliff Notes version, and I’m happy to answer more questions:

- I was assigned female at birth
- I am perceived as female by other people
- When I was a child I was often perceived as male. This did not upset me or make me happy. 
- Being perceived as female does not cause me any discomfort
- Being perceived as female does not cause me any satisfaction 
- When people perceive me as female, or when I am grouped in with women, it feels vaguely inaccurate, as if I am a different category and nobody else has noticed. I have this feeling no matter what aesthetic the women I’m grouped in with ascribe to. It’s not so much a feeling of not fitting in as that somebody has made some kind of mistake. 
- I can pretty confidently say that I do not perceive myself as female. I often forget that I “am” a woman. 
- I do not perceive myself as male
- When I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror I am often surprised somehow when I see a face that “looks” female. This doesn’t cause me any discomfort or pleasure.

2020-11-23 01:15:41,jz7uvb,5,1,"Hello my beautiful/handsome/amazing peeps I come to the almightys in search of answers 

So I'm starting the whole, let everyone know sitch and this one thing has been bugging me so I thought I'd get some advice from my peers, maybe, idk it all feels very weird trying to reach out to the void

Anyways my (borderline abusive) mother and I had a conversation where among other things, I came out as enby (whoop) during which the topic of names was brought up. Now I live 500+ miles away so I know that she cant physically do anything about it but the seed of doubt was there.

I'm AFAB and my given name is Serena, this is important as there is literally a video of my mum and my granny finding out that I were to have girly parts where my granny declares that she knew it and that I was to be named Serena as I was to be her little star (Seren being star in welsh). Not long after that when I was 4 she passed away early due to pneumonia. I was always told that my name was her best gift to me. My middle names were also given to me by her, Alexandra (my granny's name), and Hope as I was the hope that got my mother out of the abusive relationship she was in. 

Herein lies my issue

I love my name I really do, i know how much it meant to my granny and that she adored it, however more oft than not you tell someone you're named serena and they'll use she/her, regardless if you imply or even outright say otherwise because it's a very feminine name.

I've been toying with the idea of going by Alex but I know that by doing so I risk cutting off all contact with my family and that means being unable to speak to my younger siblings who are still living up home and who are aways off being old enough to leave that household.

I guess really I just wanted to talk about this all to the void, and maybe see if the void had ever had anything similar happen or even have any thoughts on the situation

Now I live 500+ miles away so I know that she cant physically do anything about it but the seed of doubt was there.\n\nI'm AFAB and my given name is Serena, this is important as there is literally a video of my mum and my granny finding out that I were to have girly parts where my granny declares that she knew it and that I was to be named Serena as I was to be her little star (Seren being star in welsh). Not long after that when I was 4 she passed away early due to pneumonia. I was always told that my name was her best gift to me. My middle names were also given to me by her, Alexandra (my granny's name), and Hope as I was the hope that got my mother out of the abusive relationship she was in. \n\nHerein lies my issue\n\nI love my name I really do, i know how much it meant to my granny and that she adored it, however more oft than not you tell someone you're named serena and they'll use she/her, regardless if you imply or even outright say otherwise because it's a very feminine name.\n\nI've been toying with the idea of going by Alex but I know that by doing so I risk cutting off all contact with my family and that means being unable to speak to my younger siblings who are still living up home and who are aways off being old enough to leave that household.\n\nI guess really I just wanted to talk about this all to the void, and maybe see if the void had ever had anything similar happen or even have any thoughts on the situation \n\nI do apologise for being so rambly, its fast approaching 1.30 am here and i should likely be going to sleep soon for my own good before I spend any more time worrying over this\n\nI hope you all have a lovely day/week/month/year/life!\n\n\nP.s. really sorry if I've tagged this wrong!"", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'A name which fits?', 'created': 1606119341.0}"

2020-11-23 01:35:36,jz86d2,0,1,"Hey ! I have been thinking of posting here for about a week or so, and I’ve been struggling for a couple months in the real with my own gender identity, I have a lil story to help explain.

So essentially I was in a relationship for nearly 3 years and it recently broke off for reasons, nothing to do with my gender, but for a while towards the end of said relationship, I got a feeling I hadn’t felt since I was younger, and it was a strong sense of femininity, I’ve always struggled with being a Straight Cis Male, I never felt comfortable, and I think a lot of that has to do with my families sense of how masculinity works; and I just never fit in that.
But ever since I was young I’ve always found interest in things like makeup, nails, dresses, and I even made all my video game characters or whatever other things I’d make, female, which never felt wrong to me unless someone pointed out it was “weird to make a character not matching my own gender.” I always thought it was cause I like girls, cause that’s the way I was taught I guess. But eventually I began to realize that it was because I wanted to be the girl I was playing, or reading about, but I had to keep that to myself because I have a very tight family in those regards, very christian but not in the good ways, and forced masculinity on me, or would call me slurs of homophobic nature, and were generally not accepting of that type of thing, so I always just played it off as me being a Cis Straight Male, though personally I’ve always identified as Genderfluid or NB, and Demisexual, because of this I had ended up pushing these thoughts behind me because I was constantly on guard to act masculine, and I ended up getting into a relationship which was a pretty normal guy/girl thing,   And from there I didn’t have time to think of who I was because of family and other complications, then I finally got out of the home I was in, and began to dress and do things that felt better to me, but hadn’t really picked up into my gender identity anymore, I had a ton of insecurities, but I didn’t really think too much about it because I was adjusting to a new lifestyle, then I ended up breaking off the current relationship, and about a year later I found someone else, and that’s who I was with recently, but my gender issues picked up like I said towards the end of the relationship, realizing I was sorta jealous of my S/o at the time, she was so pretty, sweet and talented, and I began to recognize similar past feelings, and recently I’ve decided I want to be Non-Binary, for sure, but it comes down to, do I want to transition too? I don’t mind the Idea of doing E, but what are the pros and cons, and for anyone who’s dealt with trauma or confusion on their genders, someone who appreciates both halves of their femininity and Masculinity?

/TLDR : Past Gender issues resurfacing more intense, what are pros and Cons to E and is it worth doing even if i still want to feel masculine sometimes.

2020-11-23 01:55:52,jz8hta,2,1,"Hello! I am a nonbinary teenager - This isn't a new concept to me, I have been out for almost four years. I refer to myself as an androgynous being, and I use they/them pronouns.

I am a person who loves labels for myself. I prefer to label myself as androgynous to anyone who asks, but within myself I like knowing that my gender is more complex than that.

I feel like my gender is a pretty fluid thing. I certainly don't wake up each day and feel like a new gender, but the way I relate my gender to myself and the world does change quite a lot. The way I want myself to come across socially sometimes changes - I sometimes lean towards the more masculine side of androgyny, sometimes lean into the 'what the hell is that' territory, sometimes I just want to be the embodiment of androgyny itself. I feel like sometimes I could be considered any gender, except for the neutral ones.

I'm a dude and a butch and a partner and a femboy and a thembo and an androgynous lump of sea moss.

If my gender was the colour purple, it would always be purple. Sometimes it'd be equally red and blue, sometimes it would be so blue it would be hard to tell that it's purple. Sometimes it would have splashes of every single colour in it, sometimes it would grow darker, sometimes it would have yellows and greens and glitter and god knows what else - But it would still be purple in some way. The purple is my androgyny.

I sometimes feel that my gender has the perfect mix of masculinity and femininity, sometimes I feel more masc than fem, I sometimes feel like the femininity has been replaced by a distinct 'third gender'. I basically feel like I can be a combination of almost anything, except my gender is never neutral and never has any 'absence of gender' in it. It's never wholly feminine or wholly female either.

If I could try to sum it up, I am a fluid androgynous person. The components that make up my gender, and the way my gender aligns, and the way I relate my gender to the world are subject to change, but I always have that androgyny.

I have read the definition of non-binary and it says it's someone that doesn't fit into male or female gender, therefore, non binary. And to be honest, since I grew up (I'm a cis man), I have always been interested in things and activities that are normally labeled for one gender, and also, I always look to have girl friends because I feel safer. But I don't know if it's ridiculous to say I think I'm non-binary because I like things normally labeled for women like makeup and beauty (at least in my country), and I would use female clothing; or if maybe that's a reach and I just like a few girly things and I'm actually just a cis man, male gender.

I also don't think I ""don't fit"" into any gender, I definitely look like a man and use men clothing because even though I would love to dress how I want, I haven't been able to afford clothes in a few years and use what I've always had. Also, I think I'm straight, I don't think I'm attracted to men, don't know if that matters.

Regarding pronouns, I actually don't mind if someone wants to call me he or she, but is that a thing? Being able to have both he/she as pronouns?

for quick background, i'm afab and identify as agender and transmasc. i'm currently medically transitioning, been on T for 3 months and am in the process of scheduling a date for top surgery.

i've been vaguely socially out for a bit now and have been saying that i use any/all pronouns. this is mostly from a place pronoun indifference (since i don't identify with any gender really), as opposed to actively wanting someone to use the different pronouns for me interchangeably. pronouns are not a super important part of feeling affirmed in my identity - i don't mind she/her for myself still, but i also am not dying for people to use they/them or he/him.

the main problem for me is at work - we don't have pronouns/prefixes in our signatures (which maybe i should be asking for), and i work at a clinic with a lot of client and provider interactions. i'm often ms.ed, mrs.ed, lady-ed, etc., and that kind of gendered language is pretty dysphoric for me.

i also struggle a bit with the fact that basically everyone in my circles still refer to me as she/her. i know that going by any pronouns gives them the option, and i don't mind she/her, but i think as a concept it makes me feel like they're taking the ""easy way out"" as i transition.

i've been toying with the idea of using they/he exclusively, but i'm really indecisive, hate ""burdening"" others, and get uncomfortable thinking about all the people in my life having to change something for me. idk!

all this to say - i currently use any/all pronouns, am pronoun indifferent, but have been feeling some emotional toll with people/strangers still using she/her and the gendered terms that entails. am struggling with where to go from here, and would love some input on folx' experiences. thank u!!",NonBinary,not sure where to go with pronouns,1606173725.0,"{'created_utc': 1606148525, 'id': 'jzkohh', 'num_comments': 3, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'hi all!\n\nfor quick background, i\'m afab and identify as agender and transmasc. i\'m currently medically transitioning, been on T for 3 months and am in the process of scheduling a date for top surgery.\n\ni\'ve been vaguely socially out for a bit now and have been saying that i use any/all pronouns. this is mostly from a place pronoun indifference (since i don\'t identify with any gender really), as opposed to actively wanting someone to use the different pronouns for me interchangeably. pronouns are not a super important part of feeling affirmed in my identity - i don\'t mind she/her for myself still, but i also am not dying for people to use they/them or he/him.\n\nthe main problem for me is at work - we don\'t have pronouns/prefixes in our signatures (which maybe i should be asking for), and i work at a clinic with a lot of client and provider interactions. i\'m often ms.ed, mrs.ed, lady-ed, etc., and that kind of gendered language is pretty dysphoric for me.\n\ni also struggle a bit with the fact that basically everyone in my circles still refer to me as she/her. i know that going by any pronouns gives them the option, and i don\'t mind she/her, but i think as a concept it makes me feel like they\'re taking the ""easy way out"" as i transition.\n\ni\'ve been toying with the idea of using they/he exclusively, but i\'m really indecisive, hate ""burdening"" others, and get uncomfortable thinking about all the people in my life having to change something for me. idk!\n\nall this to say - i currently use any/all pronouns, am pronoun indifferent, but have been feeling some emotional toll with people/strangers still using she/her and the gendered terms that entails. am struggling with where to go from here, and would love some input on folx\' experiences. thank u!!', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'not sure where to go with pronouns', 'created': 1606173725.0}"

I don't experience dysphoria (to the best of my understanding) but I almost always feel no internal connection to a given gender identity. I'm just hangin out. I describe myself as a woman when asked because I'm treated as one, and before I was old enough to be immediately genderable on sight, I would respond to any pronouns/gendered language used for me if context made it clear I was the one being spoken to. (i.e, ""Oi, boy, what the fuck are you doing on my roof?"") That doesn't happen very often these days, but when it does, my feelings are the same. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have moments of joy tied to presenting femininely- I look in the mirror when I'm dressed a certain way and wearing makeup and jewelry and I think ""wow, I'm gorgeous like this, my tits look fantastic"" but I have similar moments about masculine attributes- ""I'm so strong, the muscle I've built makes me look so much more powerful"". I would say there's times I identify with femininity, in the same way I identify with being a stem major- it's where my experience lies- but it's rarely strong enough for me to care if someone doesn't see that in me. 

&amp;#x200B;

It annoys me because it seems to matter so, so much to other people, and I just... don't know what to tell them, or do about it? some of my experiences are in line with regular cis people's, some aren't, but for the most part I struggle to care. Trying to lable myself that way just makes me confused. I am confused by gender as a concept. I don't feel like I'm ever going to fully get it, and that makes me feel like there's something intrinsically wrong with the way I'm seeing the world. I just deadass don't understand.

TLDR: do other enbies have/had EDs and how does that interact with your dysphoria or gender related body feels?

Hey friends! (Background: I’m 27 afab) So I have been working through pinning down my gender identity and what I want to do in terms of transition in therapy, but I get so much confusion about where my negative feelings on my body are coming from.

I think this is a lot due to the fact that I started restricting when I started high school, lost a decent amount of weight, and then moved to binge/purge for too many years after that. I never thought my body looked a way it didn’t- I can tell you who’s body my body looks like, I can draw a pic of my body. I intended to lose weight in a way I knew was unhealthy and would cause me to have little body fat. I was really pleased/proud when I lost enough weight I could wear a cami instead of a bra and didn’t get my period.

So here I am basically 10 years later confused because I don’t hate myself. And I know objectively my body looks good. But I don’t like it and I don’t particularly like looking at it. I can makes guesses at why but I don’t know for sure. I just look at my body and feel bad, I don’t really have thoughts associated with it.

Sorry this post is so long. 

So I’ve identified as female my whole life so far, and lately I’ve been questioning what I really am. I’ve always been a Tom boy at heart and I’ve never really liked ‘girly’ things so that’s never bothered me. 

A couple months ago I attended a zoom meeting for a LGBTQ+ support group and while doing introductions a couple people talked about them being trans. Everything was going fine and I was really enjoying the meeting when suddenly out of no where I had the thought that I should get top surgery. I had never thought about doing that ever in my life until that moment, so at first I just chalked it up to being a random ‘heat of the moment’ thought. 

I started thinking about it more and even talked to my therapist about it, but sadly she isn’t much help. I’m still confused about if I want that surgery, but now I’ve been questioning my gender too. When I first got my hair cut short, like a boys cut, people would misgender me as male. I was never mad, I actually used to think it was funny, but I always kept it to myself and never bothered to correct them. Now i don’t like it when someone calls me a guy, but I also don’t like it when they call me a girl either. It’s funny, one thing I’ve always wanted, even when I confidently said I was a girl, is stubble. I’ve always wanted something like a five o’clock shadow or just a nice small beard in general. I’ve also always wanted a deeper voice. 

I’ve also been seriously considering going on T, but I feel I need to be confident in my identity before I do anything life altering. My two biggest fears are that my parents won’t understand, they were excepting of me coming out as a lesbian, even if my mother was a bit slow to warm up. But my parents have both shown a strong misunderstanding and hatred for anyone trans or NonBinary. 

My other fear is that this is all just some self hatred that’s manifesting into these ideas and if I go through with them I’ll just hate myself more in the long run. At this point I’ve just been bawling my eyes out and I’ve just been a confused mess. 

It would be very helpful and appreciated if someone could point me in the right direction or maybe give their opinion on what they think.

2020-11-24 05:11:02,jzyqyq,0,1,"Hello! This is my first time being on this sub, mostly because I had a question that I thought would be good to ask to the largest crowd of non-binary people I could find. 

First, I just wanted to say that I myself am a panromantic asexual with an... interesting relationship with my gender. I also tend to keep up to date with the word on the street regarding LGBT+ media representation, despite focusing more on the economic side of politics. Having been a Steven Universe fan for a long time, for instance, I've heard everything from ""this show is revolutionary in terms of LGBT+ themes"" to ""it's a start"" to ""it's not real representation"" to ""it's outwardly offensive"". In the latter two camps I mostly hear that the LGBT+ rep in Steven Universe is less valuable or doesn't  count because it's mainly restricted to the Gems, an alien race. So just allow me to say my piece on this (skip if you don't care or want to avoid spoilers: &gt;!First of all, Steven Universe has a non-binary character, Stevonnie, who is a human fusion. People say ""Stevonnie is only called they because they're a fusion"" but Garnet, also a fusion, is referred to with she/her pronouns. There’s another non-binary human character in Steven Universe Future. Since there’s both human and non-human non-binary characters, it’s not dehumanizing. The gems in particular are great representation because their alternate ideals of sex and gender aren’t treated as part of what makes them aliens. Ruby and Sapphire being a couple, for instance, isn’t treated the same as them not understanding the concept of birthdays, or not needing to eat or sleep. Also keep in mind that Cartoon Network for the longest time was against any LGBT+ representation at all, and the ""they're actually non-binary space rocks"" things started as a way to bypass the censors. But when things came to a head with the lesbian wedding episode, Rebecca Sugar had to threaten to walk away with her own show if they didn't air it.!&lt; Representation isn't a linear trend, because culture fluctuates and companies care for profit above all else; the creators of the shows are less to blame than the corporate overlords who can bend them to their will and leave them to deal with fan backlash. Barriers on representation can only be removed with the destruction of capitalism, but that's another discussion.

Now, this isn't the first time I've heard all this. TV Tropes calls this ""Non-human Non-binary"" and it's even under the Homophobia Index. I don’t understand what’s so wrong with LGBT+ characters not being human. Let's put aside the fact that I personally know many LGBT+ people who love ALL the representation in Steven Universe, because I hate the idea of using my friends as anecdotal props. Sure, it's nice to have human non-binary characters, too, but instead of favoring one over the other, variety instead should be the goal. In terms of whether or not this is all just cis writers trying to dehumanize those outside the gender binary, the creator of Steven Universe is non-binary and mostly goes by female pronouns, just like the gems she created! Some might chalk this up to internalized self-hatred, but it’s really just a different way of looking at yourself in relation to the rest of the world. In terms of whether this is painting non-binary people as inhuman in the first place, different gender and sexual identities also exist in nature, among hundreds of plant and animal species. Nonhuman nonbinary characters are normalizing in their own way. Unless they’re otherwise grossly offensive, a non-binary character being non-human probably says nothing about how the creator views you as a person. I care only about how they are written as characters.

My Main Point: Why are shows with varying amounts of ""good"" representation pitted against each other? When you find a show with ""better"" representation (ex. a human nonbinary character instead of a nonhuman nonbinary character), then what? Do you throw the old show away? Can't it be appreciated, not just as a stepping stone, bus as its own kind of representation? As long as a character isn't some grotesque caricature, aren't they all equally valuable, humans and space rocks alike? What's so great about being human anyway? Why is that the ultimate goal? Isn't the whole point to challenge hierarchies and the status quo? By treating non-human LGBT+ characters as less valid, isn't that what the bigots want?

So, i am a 19 year old AFAB, i came out rather recent to some of my friends. I also picked a new name which i am much more comfortable with. 

Ok now i wanna talk about my parents. They are both homophobic and transphobic boomers. My mom is slightly less transphobic, because she atleast believes that trans people exist, but she isnt any less homophobic. I don't think i will ever be able to come out, i feel like maybe some time in the future, once i have moven out and become financially independent i maybe will try to come out to my mom as queer, but i feel like it will be a waste of time. 

I wont even try to come out to anybody as nonbinary, i already know that it will end badly.

And that i ""can't ignore my genes"". How everything i played with was supposed to represent flowers, how i wanted earrings, as if liking flowers and wanting pierced ears is a ""girls only"" thing. It always pisses me off so much, i was literally a baby, i do not owe anyone to be interested in ""androgynous"" things to be allowed identifying as nonbinary.

I hate this so much and it's so painful to think about because i understand that my own family, with the exception of maybe my more left leaning brother, will not accept me. I understand that most of my relatives are really toxic anyway, like for example my cousin once went on this long rant completely out of the blue how ""men are not allowed to wear makeup"".

2020-11-24 18:36:09,k0asyg,6,1,"I don't even know exactly how to put this, I tried to identify as a binary transman and I know I can be that even without wanting the medical transition, but I am also not macho, quite effeminate. 

I want to be an amab lean guy with a very effeminate look, but I am afab. I feel I cannot express my femininity, and that if only I were born amab I could be as feminine as I want without being considered a woman or girly. I want to be definitely male but the lithe effeminate soft kind of male. I don't know what to do. 

People wanted me to do the legal transition but I think it's cool to have a femme sounding name as a male and I am attached to it (the female form and the male form have just one letter of difference! and the short form that I go by is genderless!). I thought I wanted at least that but it made me feel very bad, I really don't want it. I want male pronouns but I don't drop dead if someone says she, because I correct it in my head. However I feel bad when people use the feminine pronouns to signify I'm a woman, that makes me feel bad.

To be honest I feel dirty guilty because I am afraid that I want to wear female clothes just to go back to the old day glories of feeling confident in my body: as soon as I came out I got fat and I live in shame ever since. Also I would be considered so much more normal by society, not having to worry about unshaved armpits at pools etcetera. I would be conventionally a success. I feel very good in menswear in itself, but I also feel body shame because it doesn't fit my body. If I were male, or leaner, it would not be a problem.

In short: I don't know what to do with my femininity (Gucci Bloom shower gel?) and I don't understand why I don't want the legal male name transition, short hair and Mr. Mister full on transition if I actually feel I'm naturally a male inside and I have felt so for ages. In my mind I'm a he with an androgynous body. 

If I wear high heels boots as a non passing curvy long-haired men you see that everyone will breath a sigh of relief thinking that I have abandoned my coming out and I am finally ""accepting to be a woman"", and I really dread it.

I saw non-binary and didn't think about it because I already reassured my self before then, ""nah, I am a girl, I like to wear feminine clothes sometimes and do some girly things""

2020-11-25 07:54:54,k0nwtz,1,1,"Hi everyone!

(mods, lemme know if this is ok! I want to reach out to people who could benefit from this but I also hate the idea of coming off like a big ad)

  
My name's Visi, and I'm a nonbinary illustrator and designer who recently released a kickstarter to try and solve a problem I faced when I started T, which is finding some cute queer tops that would fit over my hips and still fit in the shoulders. 

I've spent a better part of this year designing, pattern-making, researching, talking with other nonbinary/trans/queer humans, to make a button up that isn't just cute, but whose design is specifically built for our bodies. (Granted, we're by no means the same shape and size, but I wanted to make something that could work for any of us better than most things you'll find at the store). A lot of the options that specifically target us (I'm thinking like Wild Fang and Tomboy X) are usually more expensive and plain, and I just wanted to add another flavor into the mix.

&amp;#x200B;

[Cute queer gear that fits](https://preview.redd.it/j3jnnp3dcc161.png?width=3228&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e4180f35e24ebc18710c45785e4aa634eb4f420)

Here's a photo of me (right) modeling the shirts, despite not being a model we work with what we've got this year.

[I can't post in this subreddit without posting a selfie, am I right?](https://preview.redd.it/vd5tkp7kcc161.png?width=1586&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11b18a1a0aad422b9371a5d34486bfd527ccb1a5)

If this is something you'd be interested in supporting (also read as: preordering for cheaper than I would normally sell them), or if you think this is something you could share with someone who might be interested, please check out the Kickstarter! 

[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/visicolors/illustrated-button-ups](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/visicolors/illustrated-button-ups)

If I can't get the Kickstarter funded (I try to be positive, but just in case), I'll likely just save up to eventually (painfully slowly) produce these on my own since I feel really strongly about it.

&amp;#x200B;

If this is something you're interested in, or if there's a design you specifically love or would want to see in the future, let me know! Thanks lovely humans!

2020-11-25 12:11:48,k0r33p,7,1,"Sorry, this is probably gonna be a long one.

I’ve been through a lot of change in my understanding of myself over the past few years and something which recently I’ve been finding really hard to understand is gender identity.

Over the past few weeks I’ve been looking back at how I’ve chosen to ID subconsciously, and below are just some things that I’ve thought of which stick out to me, but there are other things I do/feel which have me feeling unsure.

I don’t really like being thought of as different to the others in my friend group but as the only female in a majority male friend group that comes naturally. I do show that discomfort by doing things like correcting the boys when they say things like ‘ok lads (+ lady)’ insisting that i’m ‘one of the boys too’, and they (and I) refer to me as ‘femboy’ sort of as a joke but I really love it.

I’ve also thought of my pronouns as she/they rather than just she/her for the past few years now, but have never talked about that outwardly as I feel like people I would speak to about it wouldn’t react necessarily positively or supportively.

For as long as I can remember, I’ve always thought about how I wish I was a boy, but I don’t think I’m trans as I don’t feel body dysphoria, I just wish I wasn’t a girl. That’s not some like ‘oh life would be so much easier as a boy, patriarchy sucks’ type feeling, although I have definitely used that as a sort of easy way out when I explaining how I feel because I’m not really sure how to describe it.

Me and a group of (female) friends were messaging about ‘bi girl stereotypes’ because of a TikTok we saw, and I said one of the stages the video missed was ‘gender rejection’ - they didn’t really respond/interact with my statement but I think I got the message hahaha.

Can anyone help me understand what I might be or why I might be feeling like this? I’m conscious of not claiming nonbinary at least right now because i’m worried that i’m not like... enby enough ?

We don't want to create a typical cishet white feminist magazine, so if you're sick of that bored narrative, this is the magazine for you!

As part of our research, we've set up a survey so we can get to know our readers better. The magazine is for women and non-binary people, but we're specifically interested in who is most underrepresented in the media. Frustratingly, non-binary people aren't given the same space in 'feminist' media as cis women, but we're going to change that!

If anyone has a spare ten minutes, we'd really appreciate you filling the survey out. It will help us understand which issues NEED to be talked about. It's all anonymous, so please don't be shy! Nothing is off limits for us, we want to be an outspoken voice for the underrepresented.

I think my relationship with gender has always been relatively presentation-focused (not that presentation is equivalent to gender, but it feels connected for my gender personally). I was always cosplaying more male/non-binary characters for comic con, uncomfortable in skirts, etc (im afab). I lied about my gender online as a kid and always enjoyed when my short hair confused older people. When I thought of myself or looked in the mirror, I didn’t feel like a woman (or a man), and if I had been able to pick my pronouns at birth I don’t think I would have gone with she/her, but I wasn’t uncomfortable with them either.

I always thought it was more of an internal deal, I was a little wishy-washy on if it counted as non-binary, but figured as long as I knew how I felt it didn’t matter if I had a specific label.

The only person I’ve really talked to about this was my girlfriend. At first she was kinda too supportive? Basically there was some miscommunication and she started using they/them pronouns for me around other people, mostly her friends. It felt pretty weird, so I told her I wasn’t looking to use new pronouns and she stopped.

Recently though, she broke up with me, explaining she realized she was straight. It was super hard the first few days, I’m still processing some of it, yada yada yada (I made another post about it if you’re that curious), but it’s already feeling a lot better now. Something that hasn’t stopped nagging at me though is that how felt to be broken up with for not being male enough. As the only person I’ve told, I guess I thought once I explained it properly she would understand me the way I understand myself. Now, I don’t know if it matters to me if people view me as nonbinary, or what I would need to do for that to happen. 

Basically, a lot of what I’ve been asking myself is:

Was my discomfort with they/them pronouns rooted in not being a good fit or because I didn’t have agency over their use? Would changing pronouns be enough to be understood differently, particularly for me, where presentation matters?
Was calling it an internal deal just an excuse to ignore/avoid bringing my gender into a world where I would need to reassert it over and over again? Was it just about maintaining control and fear of my identity being rejected?

2020-11-25 17:42:35,k0wsw0,7,1,"I've got a project for my gender studies class where I chose to make an infographic about the gender spectrum and some identities on it. Most of them I've seen were definitely designed by binary people and certainly don't reflect my experiences as a nonbinary person so I was wondering if y'all have any resources or input on how I could design the gender spectrum for my project.

I was thinking 4 bars kind of like the genderbread person.

Masculine ----------------- Non-Masculine

Feminine ----------------- Non-Feminine

Allogender ----------------- Agender

Aporagender ----------------- Non-aporagender

So instead of having masculine and feminine be a dichotomy I have them as separate bars for people that that may identify partially with one by not the other. Allogender just means not agender. Aporagender is a term I've seen for people who don't identify as male or female or anything on that spectrum. So third genders and such. I don't know a term for non-aporagender. I'm guessing it would be what ever the opposite of the suffix apo is.

If you think this is a good spectrum then it would be really helpful if you put where you fall on the spectrum down. Here's mine.

Okay, so I'm just feeling really,,, bad? about my appearance right now?? I don't know if it counts as dysphoria though? 

Idk, for the past few days I've just been frantically shopping for new clothes in a desperate attempt to make me feel comfortable with how I look, including things like baggy shirts, hoodies, and platform boots. I just feel like I should be taller- not in an ""I'm mad that I'm short"" kind of way, but more like it would just make me more comfortable? I hate being small and feminine, at least lately, so it's something I've been trying to fix however I can, and in this case that would be three inch boots. I have a binder, but not a lot of loose clothes, and so I ordered a few baggy shirts and hoodies online. I have short hair, but I feel like it looks girly still, so I've spent the past hour or so looking for ways to style it so that it looks more androgynous. but even doing all of that, I just can't escape this panicky feeling in my chest that my body is wrong.  

it's not even that I think I'm ugly. I think I'm fairly good-looking, if not a super model or anything. I just don't want to look like a girl. 

I want to be tall and flat chested and thinner (not that there's anything wrong with being larger, I just personally wish I looked like a noodle-y anime boy) , and have a more angular face, and just all around have a more androgynous look. and usually I'm not too bothered by it, but for some reason today I've just been sent into a spiral feeling like I'll never look the way I feel like I should look. 

I'm not really sure what the point of this post was. guess I just wanted to voice my thoughts somewhere people might listen.

I want my name to be as androgynous as possible, but I also don't want to sound like I'm trying too hard on sounding androgynous, you know? So I've been looking at various objects, natural occurrences, and animals for inspiration. 

I would actually love to go by a Japanese object-based name because the language is far more androgynous-sounding than anything else. Plus, Japanese names are already object-based, so that works out! I've been learning Japanese language and culture for 6 years now and it's actually become a big part of my life. People on Twitter say that's cultural appropriation, though, so I'm steering away from that...

I used to go by Sumi - Japanese for ""ink"" - for the longest time, and that name really felt like it was **me**. But I recently felt like it has really a really feminine feel so I abandoned it. Right now I'm testing out Chaika/Chai, which is Russian (my mother tongue) for ""seagull"", but I don't feel the same way about that name (or any other, for that matter) as I used to feel about Sumi.

2020-11-26 20:12:51,k1mgdo,1,1,"Hey all. So I have no idea how to start this post... it will probably be long and rambling, so I apologize for that.

I have no idea what I identify as, but non binary seems to come pretty close. I’m biologically a woman with severe PCOS. I’ve just hit 30 and am coming to terms with who I am. I’ve identified as bisexual for most of my life and have only been open about it in recent years. I’m also married to an amazing, supportive cis man.

Some days I want to puke at the sight of my boobs and other days I love them. I hate having my reproductive organs and the issues I’ve had since puberty and have recently made the decision that I want a full hysterectomy, as my partner and I have no desire for children anyways. 

Most days I just want to feel genderless and find that thought is comfortable. I recently got my hair cut off and have never felt more handsome and attractive. I genuinely do not care if someone refers to me as she/her or they/them. I also tend to dress fairly neutral, although sometimes with feminine flair.

I just feel like a huge ball of confusion and I don’t know. I have no idea what it means to be non binary or if I’m worrying too much about labeling myself and applying something to what I’m feeling.

2020-11-27 16:16:11,k2425i,7,1,"Hello all. 

I experience a very weird form of genital dysphoria. There are 3 aspects that make me dysphoric: 

1. overall genital dysphoria when I am menstruating

2. dysphoria over my labia (mostly inner labia)

3. dysphoria over the idea of someone looking at my genital area in a sexual situation and it looking female 

I am already planning on getting a hysterectomy. I wanted to ask if anyone here has ever heard of an option for surgery where they remove just the labia? 

I’m not really bothered by my actual vaginal opening or clitoris, and I figure it’s better to leave them in place for future potential sexual use. Is it possible to just remove the labia (in a genital nullification sort of way) but not the rest of the external sexual anatomy? I would probably be fine if they could only remove the inner labia— I assume the outer would be more difficult to get rid of.

2020-11-27 18:58:46,k279xc,13,1,"What's up folks, I'm a binary cis woman. But I've got a question, that only recently started bugging me. I checked the sidebar, and didn't see anything like this but might have missed it.

So when I was around 16 I heard of the BCRA 1 and 2 genes, and watched a video about 2 young adult sisters who got bilateral prophylactic mastectomies with reconstruction. And from then I sort of liked the idea of getting a bilateral mastectomy with no reconstruction, there was a part of me that wanted to be at risk and need to test for brca 1 and 2 and test positive so I *had to* get the mastectomy done. Anyway, left my mind after a couple months didn't really think of it again.

I have breast hypoplasia and one of my friends has too, she has it on both, but I only have it unilaterally (though my breasts are basically the same size. I'm an A cup, so I'm really not big haha). Anywho, we're talking about the deformity and she says that she'd love to get a boob job one day to fix it, I think about that but then think of the mastectomy vibe again but don't say anything.

2 years later, I decided to look up pictures of bilateral mastectomies with no reconstruction for no reason in particular and tbh I love the look when people decide to go flat (keep in mind that the procedure is done differently if the intention is to go flat/no reconstruction, than if reconstruction is intended and so the outcome is different. A lot of folks who go flat don't end up with nipples). I vocalised my admiration of going flat, and lowkey wishing I needed a prophylactic mastectomy done to an nb friend of mine, who said that that wasn't really normal for cis people. But imo I'm cis (though I have complex feelings around gender performance and norms that I won't express here bc length, and have never particularly cared for seeming girly. But I'm very comfortable with being a girl, like idc what pronouns people use I am who I am it doesn't phase me- though that might also be I live in an environment where people use incorrect pronouns all the time bc they don't really have a super good sense of English pronouns but English is the lingua franca so everyone is quite understanding in my experience).

But I've got a question, that only recently started bugging me. I checked the sidebar, and didn't see anything like this but might have missed it.\n\nSo when I was around 16 I heard of the BCRA 1 and 2 genes, and watched a video about 2 young adult sisters who got bilateral prophylactic mastectomies with reconstruction. And from then I sort of liked the idea of getting a bilateral mastectomy with no reconstruction, there was a part of me that wanted to be at risk and need to test for brca 1 and 2 and test positive so I *had to* get the mastectomy done. Anyway, left my mind after a couple months didn't really think of it again.\n\nI have breast hypoplasia and one of my friends has too, she has it on both, but I only have it unilaterally (though my breasts are basically the same size. I'm an A cup, so I'm really not big haha). Anywho, we're talking about the deformity and she says that she'd love to get a boob job one day to fix it, I think about that but then think of the mastectomy vibe again but don't say anything.\n\n2 years later, I decided to look up pictures of bilateral mastectomies with no reconstruction for no reason in particular and tbh I love the look when people decide to go flat (keep in mind that the procedure is done differently if the intention is to go flat/no reconstruction, than if reconstruction is intended and so the outcome is different. A lot of folks who go flat don't end up with nipples). I vocalised my admiration of going flat, and lowkey wishing I needed a prophylactic mastectomy done to an nb friend of mine, who said that that wasn't really normal for cis people. But imo I'm cis (though I have complex feelings around gender performance and norms that I won't express here bc length, and have never particularly cared for seeming girly. But I'm very comfortable with being a girl, like idc what pronouns people use I am who I am it doesn't phase me- though that might also be I live in an environment where people use incorrect pronouns all the time bc they don't really have a super good sense of English pronouns but English is the lingua franca so everyone is quite understanding in my experience).\n\nPoint being, I didn't at all link my gentle want for going flat (which does in fact include having no nipples lol), with gender.

I had a very hard time finding information on what I wanted.

I wanted to go from a G cup to an A or B. I considered full top surgery, but I decided I wanted a small hint o' titty because I feel it better reflects my body and gender ideal (for now, who knows).

That sounds like a reduction, right? HA! Apparently this is not a thing ppl in medicine or \*most\* of the internet have considered anyone wanting.

I was prepped for a reduction, got an IV in, then talked to the doctor and the whole thing was halted and rescheduled.

My surgeon ended up performing what was more like top surgery (""subcutaneous mastectomy"") than a regular reduction (method of which would have only dropped me to a D). 

This meant my healing process was more like that of FTM than breast reduction, and figuring that out the hard way on painkillers on the internet looking for reassurance photos was obnoxious. 

My nipples did turn totally black, and the surgeon was not sure they would survive after removing so much pedicle (the ""core"" of the breast and blood supply of the nipple). Scabs fell off and there were adhered nipple grafts underneath (woohoo!).

With the wide ""footprint"" (idk what else to call it) of my big old G cup breasts, my new ones don't cover the bottom of the anchor incision the way larger ones would, are kinda wide still, so I will may have some pretty big scars. One became infected briefly, which didn't help. They are \*maybe\* a B cup.

Additionally, I’m pretty chubby, and find having some breast tissue would look more “natural” (hate the word, but I don’t know how else to phrase it).\n\nBasically, I want moobs. I’ve heard of aggressive breast reductions, but am hesitant about going somewhere where they’ll try to shape them in a feminine manner.\n\nWhat are my options?', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Types of top surgery - can I keep some?', 'created': 1606539304.0}"

2020-11-27 22:05:19,k2aq51,5,1,"Looking for advice...

I'm AMAB, 40y/o and in a very happy marriage to a woman (63y/o F). I've had a female gender identity for as long as I can remember, and intense dysphoria off and on throughout my life. I'm doing better with my dysphoria now, but I still have a distinctively female identity. It doesn't feel true to me to deny my physical body or to deny my gender identity; both are real to me. My wife would *not* be supportive of non-traditional gender expression. She's much more traditional than I am re gender roles in a relationship, gender expression, etc. I'm not interested in trying to broach that subject. I'm happy with her and with our life, and sustaining that happiness take unquestionable priority over my physical presentation/self-expression.

So, maybe I'll never transition anything re my physical body. That said, I still take a lot of personal comfort in dressing more gender neutral, styling my hair a bit more androgynous, grooming, etc. When I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror or feel into my body, it feels more like me. I'd probably be happiest presenting fully female, but I don't know that I *need* to. It's more that I just feel increasingly comfortable presenting closer to my true self.

It's a bit of a side note, but it feels a bit paradoxical that hair styling choices, more fitted clothing, shorter sleeves, showing a little ankle, personal grooming, etc. ends up sort of more masculine and more feminine at the same time. To some degree a lot of mainstream sex appeal is a bit metrosexual, or androgynous, and I've found that I can get away with a more feminine expression as long as I take care of my body enough to pull it off.

Anyway, one think I'm still dissatisfied with is my build. I'm over 6' tall, naturally lean, and athletic. I have typical male musculature and fat distribution. I'm not entirely unhappy with my body, but it doesn't feel like it really matches who I am.

I'm seriously considering going on a low to moderate dosage of feminizing HRT... *without telling* *anyone*. I know there are a variety of treatments (estrogen, T-blockers, progesterone, etc), and a variety of dosages, and it's not all or nothing. I've also read that changes might not be as dramatic later in life, due to a lifetime of exposure to T, and individual results vary due to estrogen sensitivity, and so on. My relationship dynamics with my wife are unusual. We haven't had sex in several years, and AFAIK, we're both fine with that. We sleep in separate rooms (not out of underlying malice--just preference). We really like having each other around, but we live very independent, autonomous lives. She goes her way, I go my way, and we're fine with that. I know this is weird, and might sound dysfunctional to an outsider, but this *is not* a problem for us. I realize a few pills (or patches or injections) aren't going to change my whole world (especially conservative dosing), but I feel like just that extra little bit could help me feel more like me.

Practically speaking,  I mostly live in my own internal world, so I don't know that any sort of hormonal changes would be outwardly apparent anyway. I mostly do leg-centric sports and I'm not fat in the abdomen, so fat distributions should *mostly* follow my natural  body type and the musculature of my sports anyway. Hair styling and body hair grooming is a choice. Obviously, if I stopped passing as male or grew C-cup or larger breasts, then that might be too much to keep hidden. I also live with other family, and maybe they'd be even more observant (who knows?), but my wife is the closest to me of anyone.

At some point I'll be too old for any of this to even matter. What I would like is to feel more like myself while I'm still young enough for it to matter for me.

Am I crazy in even considering this?

2020-11-28 10:22:36,k2lfab,2,1,"ive been wondering this for a while... i identified as a tomboy as a kid, a girl in middle school, ftm in my sophmore year of hs, genderqueer/nonbinary from junior year (2014) to 2017, a woman from 2017 to now...

i used to be uncomfortable with being a girl because i hated the expectations society had of me. ive grown comfortable in expressing my femininity as ive grown and love it a lot. however, i still feel very uncomfortable and unaligned with gender roles and expectations women have in society, like initiating flirting and sex, and whoever leads in the bedroom. the thing that makes me the most uncomfortable is the idea of being pregnant and motherhood. i dont like seeing or even thinking or talking about babies or pregnant women or pregnancy bc it makes me extremely uncomfortable and distressed that that could be happen to me or i could birth a child. when i get ads relating to children or motherhood, i feel very uncomfortable and mad that im being targeted in that way. i would get a hysterectomy if i could if im gonna be honest. i like having a vagina, breasts, a feminine body, but i hate having a uterus and ovaries.

in addition, i never care if anybody uses he pronouns for me either. but because im so feminine presenting, it never happens.

another thing is if i had to work at a job where i needed business attire, i would want to wear a collar shirt, tie, pants, belt, and dress shoes. i would hate to be looked at and sexualized as a woman in that kind of environment. i would prefer a more androgynous presentation.

i use she/they pronouns bc of this feeling of being.... not being completely aligned with the whole expectations and life experiences that come with being feminine.

just in general, i really do not care about gender roles or expectations or experiences tied to femininity/masculinity in relation to how i experience and work through the world. i just wanna be me, and not have what i do or who i am completely tied to my gender/sex. a little is okay, but not EVERYTHING.

i came across the term demigirl recently but im not sure i completely understand it. but from what ive read, i do feel like its the closest thing that can describe my gender identity.

2020-11-28 21:12:29,k2vsil,10,1,"Hey friends,

I've been thinking about my gender a lot and I'm AMAB but really don't align with the label of being a man. NonBinary as a label feels right to me, and I definitely feel better identifying as it, but I haven't really wanted to change my presentation and I use he/they pronouns. I haven't even come out to my parents as enby (already came out as gay/queer a while ago) and only really talk to a few close friends about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Where I'm feeling confused/uncomfy is that, while I don't feel cis and I'm not a man, I also don't feel like I'm going through any sort of transition or struggling with that, so while I ID as enby, saying I'm trans feels like I'm co-opting someone else's struggle. This might be ridiculous, but I really am trying to figure out my gender more and navigate this whole identity thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

2020-11-29 02:09:47,k30wn8,1,1,"Hey all! So I had an idea about creating some new gender terminology for ourselves.

There are binary people. Because it’s a binary system, there’s only two types: men and women. And then there’s all kinds of men and women, like subsets (because forreal even in a binary system, not all binary men express themselves the same and not all binary women express themselves the same). Femme men, Butch women, masc men, Lipstick Lesbians, etc.

Then there are Nonbinary people.
But we don’t have any gender nouns for ourselves. We don’t have alternatives for “man” and woman”, just descriptors (Intergender, Neutrois, Bigender, Genderfluid, etc.)

So I thought it’d be interesting and fun to see what we could come up with for Nonbinary gender nouns.

I started with “man”.
A theory is that the word pertains to a hand or to hand, to guard or to protect.

With woman, one theory states it’s etymology may pertain to a person that does wrapping or twisting or turning.

To me, these sound much like early hunter/gatherer terminology.

Playing off the suffix -man (which derives from gender-neutral term for human or a person), I looked up terms for different kinds of Nonbinary people, using the Nonbinary flag for inspiration.
Yellow—one who does not associate with the binary
White—one with many or all genders
Purple—one with mixed genders
Black—one without gender

Meygman
Meykman
Meyman

Comes from meyg -, meyk -, PIE roots meaning “mix”. For people of mixed genders.

Peleman
Pelman
Palman
Opman
Obeman

Comes from menegh- copious,
op- produce in abundance,
pele- plenty
For people of many or all genders.

Neman
Neyman
Nighman
Neimen

Comes from PIE root ne - no. For people without gender. I had a hard time finding other PIE roots; many negating words derive from ne -.

Autman
Authman
Auman
Otman
Othman

Comes from aut/auth- self, oneself, natural, native, one’s own. Used in autonomy. Yellow stripe really speaks to me as very “third gender”, rightfully it’s own gender without any dependence on the binary.

In truth, I would like if our community did have our own names for Nonbinary genders in addition to descriptors for our genders. (So, something like I’m a meyman, a Genderfluid meyman. My friend isn’t a man; they’re a neiman, an Agender neiman.) But after all, if this is something the community doesn’t want, I still encourage everyone to humor the exercise and have whatever fun we can. For “many or all genders”, I came upon the PIE root sa-, in the meaning of “full, sufficient”. A name would have been something like saman, which to me sounded to much like salmon. And I said no because something that sounds like “I’m not a woman, I’m a salmon” I don’t think would be taken seriously.

If this idea isn’t something you believe in, then humor everyone and just have fun it with! Get even more creative than I was and see what you can think of. Brainstorm—throw out ideas!

So when I in seventh grade I would use he/him or they/them pronouns (I'm afab) online and labeled myself as nonbinary and used a male name. I did this for almost two years until after eight grade when my mom caught me. She told me I was just faking it/using this for attention. Immediately after this I stopped doing what I was doing before and figured my mom was right and I was just being a weird cis girl. 

But then junior and senior year of high school I started thinking more about my gender. I have never felt any connection to womanhood (?). I just personally never understood the idea of feeling a certain gender. Throughout my entire life I just figured gender wasn't like a real thing and that it was normal to not really identify as your sex. Now I'm starting to think that's not a universal thing? 

There's also been the more recent problem of my gender presentation. I am very masculine and I've realized I've always enjoyed being mistaken as a dude or having people confused about what I was. I'm in college now and this is going to sound weird but I've started going by a masc name. I don't tell everyone and only a few people call me that but I'm worried that's a sign? I know presentation =/= gender so maybe it's just a normal thing but I'm suspicious it might me more.

There's also the problem that I'm like 99% certain I do no want to be a man. And I don't think I experience dysphoria and I like having boobs most of the time. I've just spent two months contemplating buying a binder for occasional use and at this point I feel like I'm going insane not knowing what the fuck is up with my gender.

I guess I'll just described what made me start questioning and you guys can make your judgement. \n\nSo when I in seventh grade I would use he/him or they/them pronouns (I'm afab) online and labeled myself as nonbinary and used a male name. I did this for almost two years until after eight grade when my mom caught me. She told me I was just faking it/using this for attention. Immediately after this I stopped doing what I was doing before and figured my mom was right and I was just being a weird cis girl. \n\nBut then junior and senior year of high school I started thinking more about my gender. I have never felt any connection to womanhood (?). I just personally never understood the idea of feeling a certain gender. Throughout my entire life I just figured gender wasn't like a real thing and that it was normal to not really identify as your sex. Now I'm starting to think that's not a universal thing? \n\nThere's also been the more recent problem of my gender presentation. I am very masculine and I've realized I've always enjoyed being mistaken as a dude or having people confused about what I was. I'm in college now and this is going to sound weird but I've started going by a masc name. I don't tell everyone and only a few people call me that but I'm worried that's a sign? I know presentation =/= gender so maybe it's just a normal thing but I'm suspicious it might me more.\n\nThere's also the problem that I'm like 99% certain I do no want to be a man. And I don't think I experience dysphoria and I like having boobs most of the time. I've just spent two months contemplating buying a binder for occasional use and at this point I feel like I'm going insane not knowing what the fuck is up with my gender. \n\nSo do you guys think I might be nonbinary?

I would really appreciate it if y'all would tell me if you relate to any of these experiences and if they are normal for a cis woman to experience.

* When writing about women for my women's studies class, I say ""women"" instead of ""us"" or ""we"" (referring to the group as if I am not a part of it)
* Sometimes I'm surprised that I have boobs when I look down or look in the mirror. I don't have a strong urge to remove them but it sometimes feels unnatural to have them there or like they aren't a part of my body.
* I dress masc, fem, or in between depending on my mood.
* I feel uncomfortable using some gendered terms to describe myself such as queen or woman
* If someone says ""you go girl!"" or something like that, I feel uncomfortable.
* My mom asked if it bothered me that I couldn't play as a girl in Zelda Breath of the Wild but it never occurred to me that that would bother anyone.
* One time I was hanging out with my guy friends and they said that I was ""one of the boys"" and I felt happy about that.
* I've painted a beard on myself with watercolor for fun a couple of times and felt really happy doing that (even though its just for myself in my room)
* I wish my voice was lower
* I don't feel like a boy or a girl, I just feel like me
* I was recently doing college applications and every time I had to select woman as my gender I felt uncomfortable but also didn't want to select man.

As I've gotten older, this gender confusion has gotten worse and worse. I don't really want to tell anyone in my real life until I'm more sure of myself, so I thought I would share here.

2020-11-30 13:25:40,k3vpfu,10,1,"Just want to start this off by saying I’m not trying to attack anyone with preferences when it comes what body parts or anatomy they are attracted to, and that this isn’t primarily about that. 

I know nonbinary people have different thoughts and feelings re: how they would like their partner(s) to view and interact with their bodies. And it seems quite common for enby’s to prioritize their partner acknowledging their gender identity, but not mind them being attracted to their bodies in a gendered way that corresponds with the general preference of the partner’s sexual orientation (e.g. being attracted to ‘female’ bodies for lesbians and straight men). And I’m happy that these enbies are happy, but when I think about this issue in regards to myself, I just feel really uncomfortable with that? 

For background info, I’m agender (genderless) and AFAB. I don’t often experience dysphoria but it seems to manifest pretty strongly at the idea that a potential partner may secretly or even openly be attracted to me only because of my proximity to either binary gender. That the only reason they physically find me attractive is because I look like a ‘girl’ or because they find my body attractive because of its female parts. I understand most people, especially cis monosexuals, are only used to thinking about and experiencing attraction in a binary way, because people register to them as either attractive Women™ or Men™, or having attractive Women™ or Men™ features. And so even with nonbinary people, it can feel like the strongest attraction they feel is to the parts they gender in a binary way, while tolerating the other gender stuff. And that just really bothers me. Again, not because I’m criticizing anyone else’s partner, if you’re happy that’s all that matters, but more because this just makes me very dysphoric. I would hate to feel gendered in that way by my partner. I don’t deny my sex is female, and I’m not at all trying to shame people who like female body parts because they primarily associate them with women, but I’m not a woman and I would hate to feel like my partner only liked those parts because they were unconsciously or consciously making that association. Having a partner intellectually acknowledge that I’m nonbinary and have that not fully reflect in their attraction to me (instead ‘treating’ me like a woman) makes me dysphoric. Having partners only be attracted to me if I fit into the narrow confines of a binary gendered presentation makes me dysphoric. I’m wondering whether it’s even possible for me to find someone who loves me and my body without immediately gendering them, or at the very least, without gendering them in a binary way. Because if they do gender my body in a binary way via their attraction, it feels like they're saying '‘I respect that you think you are nonbinary, but in all the ways that count I see you as a woman and like the parts of you that I experience as belonging to a woman’.

So, a few days ago I was saying in one of my Discord Servers that non-binary people are trans, which by definition they/we literally are, and he said that non-binary people don't belong in the trans community. His arguments were that we don't belong in there bc ''we don't go through the same stuff he does'' and ''we don't have gender dysphoria''. Which is, as you probably know, wrong on every level. Like, I'm not comfortable with people calling me ''she'' or ''girl'' (I'm afab btw) or when people deadname me bc I'm not comfortable with the gender I was asigned with at birth, just like him. But instead of transitioning to a binary gender, which would be male in my case, I feel happy with being non-binary. And that would still make me trans, bc I'm simply not cis-gender. And I'm also not only socially transitioning bc I'm also planning on getting top-surgery bc just like him, I feel uncomfortable with my chest. Bc I have gender dysphoria, **just like him.** Like, I mean, I don't have a problem with my bottom, but still. 

So, he and me go through similar stuff but I don't get why he thinks non-binary people don't belong in the trans community when it's literally in the definition of trans. Also, not every binary-trans person goes through the same stuff as him but they are still trans.

2020-11-30 14:13:11,k3whwg,5,1,"I (m17) recently saw a tiktok by a creator I respect, and they (nb) claimed that everyone should be nonbinary, since gender is a social construct. They said that if you believed gender was a social construct, that was the same thing as rejecting the gender binary, and therefore you should identify as nonbinary. Some people in the comments disagreed with them, so I’m not going to link to original tiktok because I don’t want them to receive any hate or anything. 

I feel comfortable identifying as male, and I prefer using he/him pronouns, but I also would feel perfectly fine being referred to using they/them. I would not want to use she/her because to me that implies femininity which I don’t align with. I also believe that gender is a social construct, and I understand their argument, but I worry that by identifying as nonbinary might marginalize or offend other nonbinary people. I don’t feel in any way at odds with my identity as a male, and I also don’t feel any particular desire to use they/them pronouns or distance myself from a masculine identity. (I’m not sure if I’m using this correctly but essentially i don’t really feel any dysphoria, or any euphoria either). Most importantly I wouldn’t want to distort the definition of nonbinary to include myself if what I’m describing isn’t generally accepted as nonbinary. 

I know that pronouns =/= gender, so would being comfortable using they/them pronouns better be described as still being a man but just comfortable using those pronouns, or would that generally fall under the umbrella of nonbinary?

My younger (12) sibling is nonbinary and exclusively uses they/them, so telling my family about new pronouns would not be an issue for me. Since I don’t feel a strong need to distance myself from my current pronouns, however, “coming out” publicly seems kind of daunting and like the juice isn’t worth the squeeze.

This ended up being pretty long and I’m not sure how I could do a tldr that captures the gist of my argument, so thank you for everyone who has read this far and I would really appreciate any and all thoughts or advice.

They either didn’t like them because they are impractical and make lgbtq people look bad or they thought no one actually uses them. I hadn’t thought too much about it before then and now have mixed feelings. Do any of you guys exclusively use neopronouns or know someone who does? What do you guys think about them?

Where I kinda am at right now is neopronouns are not practical in every situation. People are going to use them wrong or be annoyed if you are like in general public. It might be more practical if you are with close friends or in a nonbinary space. I do think pronouns exists as a short had reference to someone and if they get complicated they can no longer fulfill that roll. Idk though let me know what you guys think.",NonBinary,How do you guys feel about Neopronouns ?,1606805920.0,"{'created_utc': 1606780720, 'id': 'k48rkn', 'num_comments': 20, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'I am nonbinary and use they/them.
