I won't be disclosing my age but for 6 years I've identified as FTM Transgender and need advice.

 Just recently I've come to the terms that I'm NB. Ive been looking for surgeons around where I live and have even had a constultation. Prior to figuring out I'm non binary I was on testosterone for 6 months. I've been binding ever since I've grown breasts and I've never been hyperfeminine up until recently. I've always felt a dysphoria with my chest but recently its been making me feel pretty, up until I take off my wig and makeup and clothes and can't take off the breasts.

This really concerns me and id also like to add im attracted to males and it has me questioning my worth if I were to get rid of them  (I struggle with self esteem issues and depression, and unfortunately thrive from male attention despite never not binding in public)

I find my body to be very attractive but not mine. I'm also deeply terrified of if i were to go through with top surgery thinking itd help me but only making me feel worse. 

This is one of the things that if I get done I won't be able to go back, right? 

Has anybody has an experience where they regretted getting top surgery and if so how did you handle it? Were you able to possibly get breast tissue back through surgery or hormones? 

I want to think about all my risk factors and possibilities before I go through with it, sometimes I question if my identity has been sparked through childhood trauma and im just a misguided girl

But I've also never seen my breasts as my own nor have I ever been prideful in public or when I look at my body whilst including my face.

2020-10-01 05:16:38,j32fbj,1,1,"I asked this on the genderfluid subreddit a bit earlier and was going to ask the same question here, but i got distracted and went to learn sign language instead

I was AFAB, but for a while now (lets say since i was 14, cause im 18 now) i never felt like...i was all girl? I guess. I feel a lot happier in cases where people don't even know my gender. Am i a she? Am i he? Maybe im a they, who is to know? Even with small things like when im filling out surveys, i tend to leave the ""Are you a girl or boy"" question blank until someone remind me

Added to that feeling i have moderate to intense bottom dysphoria. I know its not out of a disgust of vaginas in general because im bi, but i just hate having a vagina on me. I much rather have a dick tbh. Yet im quite content with my boobs and i would be genuinely sad if i didn't have them on me. In terms of my voice i would much rather have a larger range for it so that lowering my pitch would make me sound more masculine instead of like a girl trying to sound like a guy

To make this even more confusing, i like to be feminine. I just dont like being just female. The idea of being able to switch genders is just a really nice thought for me.

 I have been told by my mom that these feelings don't make me trans and i am just coping with being a female in a patriarchal society. Admittedly, considering that my mom is homophobic, transphobic and an overall religious bigot i don't know what i was doing telling her about feeling like this. But im not sure if its fair for me to rule out the possibility just because my mom is those things. So does this sound like i might be genderfluid?

Edit: Also i felt i needed to add this. In terms of pronouns im genuinely cool with all of them. Since i was AFAB i don't feel anything when people refer to me as she, but i feel genuinely pleased when people refer to me as he. Where i live is very transphobic so the conscious use of singular they is never really done. People will just pic a pronoun and hope you'll correct them when needed, so i've never really been refered to as they.

Yet im quite content with my boobs and i would be genuinely sad if i didn\'t have them on me. In terms of my voice i would much rather have a larger range for it so that lowering my pitch would make me sound more masculine instead of like a girl trying to sound like a guy\n\nTo make this even more confusing, i like to be feminine. I just dont like being just female. The idea of being able to switch genders is just a really nice thought for me.\n\n I have been told by my mom that these feelings don\'t make me trans and i am just coping with being a female in a patriarchal society. Admittedly, considering that my mom is homophobic, transphobic and an overall religious bigot i don\'t know what i was doing telling her about feeling like this. But im not sure if its fair for me to rule out the possibility just because my mom is those things. So does this sound like i might be genderfluid?\n\nEdit: Also i felt i needed to add this. In terms of pronouns im genuinely cool with all of them. Since i was AFAB i don\'t feel anything when people refer to me as she, but i feel genuinely pleased when people refer to me as he. Where i live is very transphobic so the conscious use of singular they is never really done. People will just pic a pronoun and hope you\'ll correct them when needed, so i\'ve never really been refered to as they. But i do like the idea of someone refering to me as they because they cant really tell which gender i am', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'I think i might be genderfluid or bigender but im not sure', 'created': 1601554598.0}"

What do you do when you can’t be you?

You sit and explain but to who?

To yourself? To others? 

To parents who should be your cover?

“Be strong” they say 

But I don’t know the way 

“We’re here” they say

But when I look around all I see is day

No support, no love

“That’s dumb” they say as if they are above

“You’re born a gender and you stay that gender”

But transitioning is starting to look like a contender 

“I’m not me everyday 

I’m not who I want” I say

Who am I without support?

This transition I might have to abort

“Be yourself, we’ll always love you”

But will that promise ever come due?

“A disappointment, a disgrace,

We failed as parents, how can we show our face?”

“I’m not broken” I barely squeak 

“I’m just different. My true self I can’t defeat”

“I tried for you to be a good child”

They shake their heads as if my words are wild

“You’re our daughter, you’ll always be,

We didn’t expect this, how could we?”

“Just listen to me, I know who I am”

“You’re too young” it’s like speaking to a dam

All I want is love and support 

I tried my hardest to be a good sport 

But I just can’t pretend anymore 

I’m not your daughter. I’m more.

I’m your child who you should love

I’m sorry that I’m not enough 

Call me “they/them” I say to you

You look at me as if I’m the fool

I tried and tried but now I’m done

I’m not your daughter and I’m not your son

I’m your child and I know it’s tough

But I’m me and that should be enough

2020-10-02 00:02:09,j3ka0i,2,3,"This is long, so thank you for reading if you do. TLDR at the bottom.

My boyfriend (24 ftm) and I (23 NB) have been together for almost six years. Our relationship has always been great. He has always been supportive and there for me and I like to think I have done the same. I came out as nb about a year ago and he was super supportive and helpful with me adjusting to realizing my gender identity. My family was also supportive. I lost my last close friend along the way due to this.

Fast forward to September 2020. I decided to change my name and pronouns to better express myself. I have been loving my new name. The sound of my name and pronouns coming out of people's mouths makes me so happy. Unfortunately, my family decided it was a big joke and basically have the idea that if they don't bring it up, this isn't real. I have been struggling to keep it together recently because I feel my boyfriend and family are all I have right now. 

My boyfriend came off as super supportive and has been using the correct pronouns and name. However, I stumbled upon a reddit post that sounded eerily similar to our situation. He basically said that his partner recently changed their name and pronouns, started talking about binding and possibly taking T. He was asking if he should break up with me because he isn't sure about the attraction between us now. The thing is, I never really brought up the T or binding because I was still doing research and figuring out what I want. So, he probably went through my phone??

I confronted him about the reddit post (this is the second time he has posted something about me instead of just talking to me. Last time it lead to issues and strain in our relationship.) He said the post belonged to him and he took it down. We talked on the phone because he was not home that night (he spends some nights at his grandmother's) and I told him how much it hurt me that he did not talk to me about the situation (AGAIN) and that I felt like I had no one in my corner that I can trust at this point. He told me he has no intention of breaking up with me, he was just ""freaking out"" then proceeded to start crying and say how he ""always fucks up.""

Fast forward to now, he has been self harming a lot, crying a lot etc. I found another post definitely by him asking the same thing under another account name. I don't even know what to do at this point. Do I confront him again? Do I leave it? I know I am doing the same thing I am upset about, but considering he has done it at least three times, I am kind of like whatever. Petty, ik. 

I feel like our relationship is hitting a dead end. He won't talk to me about anything when I try to ask, he keeps posting about me behind my back instead of talking to me. I am so unsure about what to do. I want this relationship to work, but I also don't want to sacrifice my sanity and ability to be who I want to be.

i’m 24 and afab, i’ve known i’m nonbinary for years and have been going by they/them pronouns since i was 17. hrt is something i think about constantly but i’ve never been sure if i wanted to go through with it. there are things i’d like to change like voice pitch and facial structure but others i don’t want, like facial hair. i’ve had a couple patches over the years where the dysphoria felt so bad i felt i... needed it? like to the point where i actually called my local planned parenthood about it but got discouraged by the tone of voice of the person on the phone and ended up hanging up.. but anyway those would eventually go away and i’d feel comfortable in my own skin for the most part.

yesterday i saw that planned parenthood started booking telehealth appointments for hrt and i just kinda... impulse booked an appointment. without really thinking about it, and now that i’ve had time to register what i did i’m kind of freaking out? i mean i guess people don’t think about these things unless.. they want it you know? and i think i do want it but i’m scared haha! oh my god

recently i’ve heard of microdosing and that sounded amazing to me. i like the idea of being in control of the pace at which my body would change should i choose to take hrt, but i’m still.. on the fence. should i go through with it? does anybody else have experience taking hrt when they were unsure about it? has anybody tried microdosing?

2020-10-02 06:22:03,j3pizl,3,1,"It's a week since I came out as gender fluid, and I've continued to do a lot of self reflection (potential introspective boredom warning...I'll try to keep it more broadly relevant!). I feel like I've had a middle of the night revelation, and wonder if anyone else feels this way too?

First off though, this has been an amazing week from a coming out point of view, but also bloody awful. My lovely wife had a positive covid test,  and has been grotty and isolating in one room all week. Thank goodness she seems to be over the worst of it and looks to be on the road to a speedy recovery. Her health is number one, but it feels so awful that we just reconnected again as soul mates, and then have been ripped apart. By the by I also have a premier league disability which makes catching the virus myself a particularly bad idea. What will be will be, but of course that thought adds a little spice to the chilli for both of us.

But in that context, the brain carries on its work, so here is my revelation. I've been thinking about my gender in three parts....the body, the mind and the spirit. I define the mind as patterns of thought and behaviour, and the spirit as that indefinable essence which makes you, you. Your core character, which influences the relationship between  your mind and body. I've come to feel they can each have a sense of gender. For me, I have a male body, and I'm pretty comfortable with that (apart from the hair). I have a male dominated mind, not least from 50 years of navigating the world in this big old male body, and again I'm ok with that. But I also feel I have a totally female spirit, right at the core of me. And it's this balance and tension that is at the heart of my being genderfluid, and which explains some of my feelings this week.

I talk about a male and female mind / spirit. I dont btw mean stereotypical male or female attributes. Any male quality can also be a female quality and vice versa. It's just my own subjective sense, but you will have your own sense of things which feel 'male' or 'female' to you. For much of my life my female spirit has been neglected,  sidelined. She has sometimes fought to get out, but she has always  been outnumbered and put back in her place. Often with a flea in her ear and a string of insults. ""Don't come back round here with that crazy talk!"" However,  she is such an important part of me, and by coming out I am starting to give her the recognition,  attention....and credit she deserves. I wouldn't be the same person at all without her.

I have been getting into smaller expressions. A subtle daily eye look, painted nails, a blouse that nobody is around to see. I wondered why these things felt so important to me, then I realised. It's me allowing my female spirit to exist. It's me saying, it's ok, I know you're in there, you're not forgotten. There is some small outward manifestation that is a reminder to me and people around me that I am made of a mix of three parts. It's also a reminder that my female spirit will never again be put under lock and key. She doesn't want to take over (in fact, she can't), but she needs to be allowed to exist. My mind and body have had a pretty good thing going on, and now it's time for them to share nice! Managing that good sharing is going to be the pattern of the rest of my life.

That revelation really helped me, i hope it might be useful to someone else. Does anyone else feel anything like this?

In the meantime I am counting down the days till my wife can come out of isolation. I hope you won't mind me asking for a few extra good vibes.

I feel like I\'ve had a middle of the night revelation, and wonder if anyone else feels this way too?\n\nFirst off though, this has been an amazing week from a coming out point of view, but also bloody awful. My lovely wife had a positive covid test,  and has been grotty and isolating in one room all week. Thank goodness she seems to be over the worst of it and looks to be on the road to a speedy recovery. Her health is number one, but it feels so awful that we just reconnected again as soul mates, and then have been ripped apart. By the by I also have a premier league disability which makes catching the virus myself a particularly bad idea. What will be will be, but of course that thought adds a little spice to the chilli for both of us.\n\nBut in that context, the brain carries on its work, so here is my revelation. I\'ve been thinking about my gender in three parts....the body, the mind and the spirit. I define the mind as patterns of thought and behaviour, and the spirit as that indefinable essence which makes you, you. Your core character, which influences the relationship between  your mind and body. I\'ve come to feel they can each have a sense of gender.

I’m here in good faith with my questions, so if I offend at any point it is out of ignorance and not malice.

It's hard for me to pass or feel confident when going out in public, and while quarantine has been preventing me from going out, I'm worried my anxiety with my dysmorphia and dysphoria once COVID ends will be heightened. It's stressful trying to feel comfortable in my own skin AND be okay with how other perceive me. Even though I know it doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things how a stranger thinks I identify, it's still daunting for someone who already has anxiety about these things without the nonbinary identity thrown in the mix.

I used to have a shorter haircut (thinking about maybe going back to) but I'm not sure. I like my haircut now, but don't like the perception of how it's relatively feminine. I also wear sports bras and boxer briefs, which helps me, and usually a tshirt and jeans when I go out. I'm cold often, and wear a jacket a lot which also helps but living in Florida makes it hard to go out in my usual wear while staying comfortable and weather permitting. I'm also getting over a breakup in which I finally was feeling very confident in my identity and how I was perceived by my partner, knowing they didn't care how I looked, just who I was as a person. It's kind of taken a bit of a toll on me lately in many ways, especially with my confidence being built up only to lose it.

I guess I'm just making this post to see if anyone has any advice for either binding (or other such methods ie better sports bras or strapless ones) or anything else that could help my confidence. Also, if anyone has advice on birth control options for regulation that I suppose are nonbinary and demisexual friendly that would be great.

Anyhow, thank you for reading and any advice is appreciated 💕",NonBinary,Advice for a Florida College Student,1601703160.0,"{'created_utc': 1601677960, 'id': 'j44gzo', 'num_comments': 4, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""Hi all!

Obviously both take a lot of dedication and hard work but did anyone find it easier or harder because I've heard it was slightly easier to notice weight difference when you are male or are taking T.\nAlso side note,  I also plan on beefing up my arms because whatever form I take I want my Thicc thighs and arms😆, but I already know that gaining muscle is said to be easier on Testostrone.

2020-10-03 21:50:09,j4nha0,7,1,"Thank you to anyone willing to read or respond to this. **It's very long, and I'm sorry for that.** But here's my story so far. I never thought I'd be here.

  
I'm AFAB and just turned 20. I've never had any *big* instances of questioning my gender before. Except... A few days ago. I was on the phone with a friend who was hanging out with my lovely girlfriend (21F). He called over to her, ""Your girlfriend is on the phone!"" and I immediately felt... this very gentle sensation that could be summed up as ""mmm no, don't like that."" To clarify; it's not that I don't like the word or being attached to her. We have a stable relationship and have known each other for many years. I get so much serotonin saying ""my girlfriend"" it's almost silly. I know that if my gender weren't female, we're both pan, and this would not necessarily change anything between us. I even mentioned it rather soon after since it struck such a chord with me, and she readily agreed to do her best to call me her partner, no questions asked. ~~She's so amazing but that's not the point here~~. Suddenly, I was overanalyzing everything.

Sure, I've always presented androgynously, and have enjoyed wearing a binder occasionally, but that's just how I feel most comfortable, so I never thought too hard about it. I don't particularly like to look at my face in the mirror, but it's just always been that way. I've never felt one way or the other about my name. I don't dislike most things related to my sex assigned at birth. I may not *love* the way I look, but none of it stems directly from feminine features (my chest, genitalia, hips, voice, etc.) My pronouns have never felt wrong or caused me discomfort.  I had the classic ""I'm not like other girls"" phase where I hated pink, makeup, and other feminine things, but eventually that passed and I grew to like these things on my own terms, without them being attached to a sign of a lack of intelligence. I've even felt what may be described as gender dysphoria when someone has occasionally misgendered me as male- I had a haircut for a while that I hated for the sole reason that it meant suddenly I was often read as male by strangers. I definitely feel uncomfortable when male pronouns are used referring to me.

But I think... I may have just always been unaware of the other part of my gender. The more neutral part. It was always there, but never acknowledged by others, or even by myself. I was already familiar of plenty of identities and what they mean, and I remembered the term demigirl. ""Identifying partially but not wholly with a female gender."" I just... I looked in the mirror, and thought, ""That person. She's a girl, but they're also nonbinary."" I felt... this wave of relief and happiness. It felt comfortable, and right. I *recognized* the face in the mirror in a way I never have before. Is that what gender euphoria is? It's so nice if it is.

In all honesty, I'm scared. I've always felt stable in my gender identity. Certainly, I've got to be wrong if I've never felt this before now, right? I'm too old to *suddenly* realize this. But everyone tells kids ""you're too young to know this!"" So, when is a person old enough to start questioning? On the other hand, most binary trans people say they've felt something was off since their earliest memories. So, when's it too *late* to start questioning?

This post is mostly made out of anxiety. I just want some outside perspectives from people who are nonbinary to tell if what I'm describing sounds 'real' or not based on their experiences. I know I'm really the only person who will know in the end, but I guess I'd like some advice.

^(\*Also, for anyone who may be worried, I have a plan of how to deal with these feelings in a healthy manner that doesn't involve rushing anything: I don't plan to ever start HRT or ever have surgery. I would only 'socially transition' (change to a combination of she/her and they/them pronouns, maybe change my name??) with my friends after I've thought on this for a long time, (months, if not years) and made sure.)",NonBinary,"So, I'm Questioning",1601787009.0,"{'created_utc': 1601761809, 'id': 'j4nha0', 'num_comments': 7, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Thank you to anyone willing to read or respond to this. **It\'s very long, and I\'m sorry for that.** But here\'s my story so far.

So, when\'s it too *late* to start questioning?\n\nThis post is mostly made out of anxiety. I just want some outside perspectives from people who are nonbinary to tell if what I\'m describing sounds \'real\' or not based on their experiences. I know I\'m really the only person who will know in the end, but I guess I\'d like some advice.\n\n^(\\*Also, for anyone who may be worried, I have a plan of how to deal with these feelings in a healthy manner that doesn\'t involve rushing anything: I don\'t plan to ever start HRT or ever have surgery. I would only \'socially transition\' (change to a combination of she/her and they/them pronouns, maybe change my name??) with my friends after I\'ve thought on this for a long time, (months, if not years) and made sure.)', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': ""So, I'm Questioning"", 'created': 1601787009.0}"

2020-10-04 05:28:24,j4tr3s,5,1,"Hello, I don't have much knowledge when it comes to terms/labels relating to gender and want to understand it. I've been wanting to learn for a while now, but each time I try I keep getting very confused/overwhelmed. I've written my main questions, please tell me if I need to clarify anything or if I said anything wrong.


What is defined as gender, and can it be completely separate from biological sex. Like could you be non-binary, but still see yourself as completely female biologically?

Does Cis relate to how someone views their sex, gender, or both?

What are some of the most common labels and their differences?


Im also wondering whether there's any labels I'd fit, I'm AFAB and I'm completely comfortable being female biologically, and prefer she/her pronouns, but I don't really know how I identify gender wise, as I don't really understand what gender is.

I've been out as a cis lesbian for almost 3 years now; but over the last few months I've been wondering whether I'm genderfluid, non binary or just confused.

I'm afab (as you can already tell) and I'm not sure if im non binary or not. I feel quite female most of the time but there's also some of the time where I don't feel female at all. Im very masculine in some ways and u don't wear makeup often or worry about my hair or my looks.

I've spoken to my two best ftm mates (best friends you could ask for) and they suggested that I experiment if I'm unsure. On Friday I decided to go ahead with it and go under the name Kaylen. I thought of this name as its very similar to my birth name and its more of a gender neutral name. 

Thing is though, ever since Friday, I've been extremely unsure about myself. I keep telling myself that I'm female and I shouldn't go ahead with this becuase I'm female. I want to experiment but I have so many things holding me back: 

1. My mind telling me that I know I'm female. 

2. My gender was the one thing I was certain about and now I'm not sure and I'm really insecure

3. I'm scared that if I realised I was nb my parents would be ashamed for changing my name

4. I like my birth name and my lady parts. 

Is it normal/okay for a nb person to be okay with their birthname/sexual... Bits??? 

And 5. For some reason I'm scared of the idea of being trans.

2020-10-05 02:27:26,j5bimf,3,1,"Hiya, i’m Yat (not my real name lmao) im 20, assigned male at birth and recently been really questioning stuff about my gender identity. i’ve known i’m bi for about 6/7 years now but recently i’ve also been looking into gender.

I’ve seen a lot of memes and posts from trans artists i follow on twitter talking about their experiences, and some of them really hit me hard and surprised me with how relatable they are.

My only reservation about considering myself trans or nonbinary is that i’m not necessarily uncomfortable presenting masculine, he/him pronouns, or with any aspect of my body. (in fact i quite like my “manly” body shape)

a few things that i’ve started questioning further recently:

-in most video games or tabletop games i’ll play as the “traditional” female character or in games like Animal Crossing i’ll create myself and dress however i feel at the time, sometimes wearing dresses or what have you. it just feels good(?) i’m not sure how to explain it

My dilemma right now is trying to figure out if I also identify with an identity in the female spectrum. I am extremely feminine, the only changes I want in my body are a flat chest and male genitalia. I want to wear feminine clothes, act in a feminine matter and have feminine features on my body.

Despite all this, I want to be seen and addressed as male. But here’s the thing: I had to go out today, and when employees assumed and treated me as female, it didn’t bother me like, at all. It really doesn’t bother me that much when people see me as female. I felt very comfortable with my female gender today until I got home, had to change clothes and noticed my breasts more. But the discomfort was pretty mild.

I still sometimes look at cute girls and wish I looked like them. Sometimes I think that if I was an extremely cute girl, maybe I’d have no problem living like that my whole life. Of course, I’m not sure if that’s completely true. I also on occasions want to forget about my gender “discoveries” and just keep living as if nothing happened (like going back in the closet and locking myself up).

2020-10-06 02:43:55,j5xb3m,3,1,"Hello! My name is Rowan. And this is my story. I'm young. Like, 14 young. Last year around November me and my best friend we're walking to class and she said ""Hey, I think I may be non-binary"" I nodded and said, ""What's that""? She replied with ""It's like...your neither gender. You don't feel like you fit into the male or female category"" and I nodded and said, ""Oh cool"". For the next couple of weeks, I had that thought in the back of my head. Then one day when I got home I looked up ""Non-binary"" and I found out about all the umbrella terms.  Demi-girl,Demi-boy,Genderfluid,Agender,Non-binary. All of it. And I found you could still look fem or masc and still be enby. Huh. Was I...non-binary. I thought about it. Maybe? I continued with my life, but just later that week I said to my friend, the same friend who introduced the term non-binary to me ""Hey I think I may be non-binary"" and she said ""Omg that's amazing \[deadname\]""! and then she started using they/them pronouns. It felt great. And we did that for a couple of months. By summer, it was time for sleepaway camp. I and my best friend (she comes up a lot so we'll just call her Alice) went together. when we went, we met a boy. we'll call him Desmond. Desmond turned out to be a transman. Desmond taught me a lot. Then he told me about dysphoria. And I realized that feeling. On how every time I looked in the mirror I wanted to be sick. How I looked too much like a girl, and everyone would know I was a girl. And I knew I had to change something. When camp ended I texted Alice my plan. I have two moms. I was going to tell one of them. That night, when I was watching some Netflix she came downstairs. I said, ""Hey can we talk""? I paused the tv and I said. ""I want to cut my hair"" she immediately had a worried look on her face. she said ""But your hairs so beautiful! why would you want to change it""! my hair is very long, thick, dark, silky so you could call it pretty. but it isn't me. I suddenly didn't feel ready. I just said ""I don't know"" and then she started yelling about how I was always hiding things from her and how I didn't trust her, which wasn't nice or fair. We soon got into a heated argument and at some point, I yelled out, ""I don't even know if I'm even a girl""! she stopped and I explained. She just listened and then came over and gave me a hug and said ""I'll always support you"". We continued watching Netflix, ate cookies, and snuggled. It was overall a pretty good night. Fast forward a few weeks. I asked my other mom ""Hey what do you think about there being more than to genders""? She then quickly started saying things like ""Biologically only two sexes""! And ""You can't change science""! I moved away and then said ""Ok, what would you think if I or my brother we're trans""? She said, ""I will always support you, but just know that I would be sad. Because I would be losing my daughter/son"" and at this point, I was super upset. I would never want to make her sad. I love her. So I just stayed closeted from her. I hated it. Then when night I told her. She said, ""I was doing it for attention"" and ""I was copying other people"" and ""Your was a brat, trying to seek attention like that"" and ""they/them is plural"" and ""do you want people to think your sick""? it hurt so bad. I hated it. Then recentley I joined a trans discord server. I was chatting with some people when I asked with help coming up with a new name. I got suggestions like Rain, Red, Ray, Rai, and Rufus. All of them were nice. But not me. Then someone typed in: ""Rowan"". That was it. It was perfect. I was Rowan. Wow. I was Rowan. And a few weeks ago I got a hair cut. It's been almost a year since I've realized who I am. And I've never been happier.

I never liked the way I looked in t-shirts and always avoided them. So I wore shirts that accentuated my chest and waist. Blouses and dresses make me the most comfortable and I finally figured out why. 

It sounds kind of backwards, but I get more dysphoria in unisex clothing than in feminine clothing. For example, when I wore more unisex clothing, I would feel uncomfortable seeing my chest make little lumps in the shirt. It always just felt and looked off to me and I couldn’t put my finger on it. Now I realize that I didn’t like that my breasts showed through the shirt. I feel like when I’m wearing “normal” clothes, I’m supposed to have a flat chest. My mind expected to see a flat chested person, but there they were, making little lumps in the shirt. 

But when I wore feminine clothing that accentuated my chest, it was like it wasn’t really my chest, it was just what the outfit was supposed to look like. I could blame my breasts on the clothing style instead of confronting the feeling that ideally I should be flat.

Ok so I have a little question:

My  English teacher always uses the wrong pronouns for me. She uses she/her, even though I have repeatedly told her that my pronouns are they/he. At first, I was like, ok it is a learning progress, right? But  now more than a month has passed and she still hasn't used the right ones once. The point I figured, that she is probably actively ignoring  my pronouns, was when we had Paul Lisicky and she mentioned him being  gay more than necessary and in a downgrading tone. She is also  really into stereotypes, she says things like boys don't cry and shit like that.

But the only other things reminiscent of dysphoria I experience is if I am called by my full name rather than nickname, if someone were to impose femininity on me, or in the event that she/her/hers pronouns or being called a girl was said over and over again in a very short period of time. Those are my pronouns and how I see myself, but being aggressively reminded would be uncomfortable I would imagine.\n\nWould you say this is common in non-dysphoric enby anatomical females?', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Is disgust with the thought of pregnancy common for enby biological females?', 'created': 1602062762.0}"

2020-10-07 11:42:48,j6pb0g,4,1,"Hi everyone. Its my first time posting here so im sorry for any errors. 


I also want to put a **trigger warning** for internalised phobia or hatred. I dont want to bring these thoughts to anyone who isnt having them already today. Please skip this if you think it could hurt you.


I came out as male about 7 years ago and after a year realised it wasnt what I thought it would be. It still didn't fit. I, internally, began to identify as nonbinary and eventually let some of my friends and family in on my identity. Somehow it was scarier than coming out as a man. I dont know why, I just know its what feels right. When I think of myself I dont think of myself as binary. I've happily accepted this for the past 6 years. 

I've recently made it public that I use they/them and feel so, so invalid and disgusting and embarassing. I've been called ""it"" by people I thought were decent. I've lost friends over ""jokes"" about my genitals. I've had my social media spammed with ""there's only two genders"" from people I hadnt seen in years.

I could manage all this, just about. I accepted that very few people knew or understood the complexity of gender, but I'm dating a cis person and it makes me feel further more angry at myself. Angry that I'm not binary, embarrassed that who I am doesnt fit with who he is, scared that his family or friends would reject me or him if they knew, scared that he doesnt understand or ""believe"" me.

I dont want to bring these thoughts to anyone who isnt having them already today. Please skip this if you think it could hurt you.\n\n\nI came out as male about 7 years ago and after a year realised it wasnt what I thought it would be. It still didn\'t fit. I, internally, began to identify as nonbinary and eventually let some of my friends and family in on my identity. Somehow it was scarier than coming out as a man. I dont know why, I just know its what feels right. When I think of myself I dont think of myself as binary. I\'ve happily accepted this for the past 6 years. \n\nI\'ve recently made it public that I use they/them and feel so, so invalid and disgusting and embarassing. I\'ve been called ""it"" by people I thought were decent. I\'ve lost friends over ""jokes"" about my genitals. I\'ve had my social media spammed with ""there\'s only two genders"" from people I hadnt seen in years.\n\nI could manage all this, just about. I accepted that very few people knew or understood the complexity of gender, but I\'m dating a cis person and it makes me feel further more angry at myself. Angry that I\'m not binary, embarrassed that who I am doesnt fit with who he is, scared that his family or friends would reject me or him if they knew, scared that he doesnt understand or ""believe"" me. \n\nI want to go back.

Its only been 4 days so far so Im sure itll get better it just seems like such a big decision I dont want to regret or change my mind about since I do genuinely like the name now. \n\nNo real point here just talking lol', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Name change anxiety', 'created': 1602115774.0}"

My Picrew avatars side-by-side; the first was made in the middle of the summer, right after my haircut, and the second was made today.

The weather is getting colder and my hair is getting longer and I don't like it. It seems to soon to ask my Dad to cut it again, though, since it's only been a few months.

Ugh, I really hate getting read as female, especially when I need to use the restroom and there's no single unisex toilets, it's one of two gendered multiple-stalls bathrooms - one which has urinals and one which doesn't. And if you go into the ""wrong"" one you risk getting strange looks, or worse being shouted at and/or physical attacks. 

It seems that I tend to get read as male by women, and as female by men. Being in the women's restroom makes me, and women, very uncomfortable, but being in the men's restroom that could have other men in there at the same time may not be a good idea either. I know most cisgender guys are probably perfectly fine, but being raised as a girl gave me the instinct that forces me to be cautious around them.

Any advice on the last above sentence? I really want to overcome that. 

What do y'all do about using gendered restrooms?

Any experiences or opinions on my situation would be much appreciated. I guess I’ll start of by saying that I’m 18 and AFAB, but I’ve never really thought about myself and what I identify as. I’ve pretty much just gone along with what other people called me and never gave it too much thought. 

I’ve experienced moments where I forgot that I was female and had one of those “oh right” moments where I remembered. I’ve also had times where being referred to with she/her pronouns has made me wince or just made me generally uncomfortable. This has happened a noticeable number of times but doesn’t happen every time I’m referred to as a girl. One friend in particular uses the nickname “girlie” for me and I’ve never had a problem with it. 

I prefer to dress more androgynous if possible (sometimes more feminine/masculine depending on my mood) but I’ve been told that I have a pretty feminine face so I’ve always been identified by others as female. But, recently, because of COVID I was misgendered as male because I was wearing as mask. I had been kind of hoping for someone to use he/him pronouns for me, but it didn’t feel quit right. Not necessarily bad, just not quite right (similar to female pronouns ig). 

In regards to sex, I’m pan and usually prefer a more submissive role for myself. However, I have imagined myself with male genitalia, and found that I prefer it to imagining having female genitalia. I think this may be something that I also felt when I was younger. Over the past few years, I’ve also had mixed opinions about having breasts. A lot of the time, I want to be flat chested with a few occasions where I don’t mind presenting more feminine. But, generally, I don’t like the way my body looks with breasts. I’m not sure if this wouldn’t be dysphoria or if it’s because of poor body image. 

I don’t know if being okay with dressing up more feminine is because of my own attraction to feminine people seeing my body in the mirror is appealing for that reason or if actually enjoy myself coming across as female.

2020-10-08 06:01:13,j77ti2,6,1,"So, I'm creating a character who is largely based off of me and my experiences, but I keep running into some problems and I want some outside opinions.

1. The ""alien"" stereotype. I know about this stereotype and I definitely see how damaging it can be, so if this character's story actually ever gets published/released, I don't want the character to harm anyone. Personally, I do not think that this character would fall into the stereotype, but again, I want outside opinions. This character, we'll call them Charlie (might be the final name; I haven't decided yet), is an alien. However, they come from a planet which has a similar societal structure to Earth, and has a population of varying gender identity. So, in essence, they aren't nonbinary because they're an alien; they're nonbinary because they're nonbinary (and they just so happen to be an alien). They also live on Earth, but are not the only alien to live there, nor are they the only nonbinary alien on Earth. Does Charlie fall into the stereotype?
2. Deadnaming and misgendering. Like I said at the beginning, I am largely basing this character off of myself and my own experiences. Something I have run into as I begin college is a new form of ""double life."" While in high school, I could be myself there but I had to hide at home. Although I could be myself, I had to deal with people who already knew me and the conflicts that arose with deadnaming and misgendering. However, now that I am in college, no one knows me and I can start a clean slate. The issue that I run into, however, is my mother isn't accepting of me so she only refers to me by my deadname. The point I am trying to get to is that I was imagining a small plotline where Charlie has been living as themselves (or themself, depending on which word you use) on Earth for awhile, but their parent(s) come to Earth to ""check on them"" and refer to them by their deadname and by the incorrect pronouns (because they're unaccepting).

The ""alien"" stereotype. I know about this stereotype and I definitely see how damaging it can be, so if this character\'s story actually ever gets published/released, I don\'t want the character to harm anyone. Personally, I do not think that this character would fall into the stereotype, but again, I want outside opinions. This character, we\'ll call them Charlie (might be the final name; I haven\'t decided yet), is an alien. However, they come from a planet which has a similar societal structure to Earth, and has a population of varying gender identity. So, in essence, they aren\'t nonbinary because they\'re an alien; they\'re nonbinary because they\'re nonbinary (and they just so happen to be an alien). They also live on Earth, but are not the only alien to live there, nor are they the only nonbinary alien on Earth. Does Charlie fall into the stereotype?\n2. Deadnaming and misgendering. Like I said at the beginning, I am largely basing this character off of myself and my own experiences. Something I have run into as I begin college is a new form of ""double life."" While in high school, I could be myself there but I had to hide at home. Although I could be myself, I had to deal with people who already knew me and the conflicts that arose with deadnaming and misgendering. However, now that I am in college, no one knows me and I can start a clean slate. The issue that I run into, however, is my mother isn\'t accepting of me so she only refers to me by my deadname. The point I am trying to get to is that I was imagining a small plotline where Charlie has been living as themselves (or themself, depending on which word you use) on Earth for awhile, but their parent(s) come to Earth to ""check on them"" and refer to them by their deadname and by the incorrect pronouns (because they\'re unaccepting). I planned on this being a point in the story to show how harmful that is, and to honestly just reflect my feelings and experiences onto a character (there are a million other things I wanted to say regarding this issue, but it\'s currently 12:50 AM and I can\'t think straight).

Do any of you feel the same?\nOr am I just kinda broken?\nAny idea what I could call myself?\n\nI would really appreciate it if I could get some help with this all.\n\n\nThank you in advance for your time and help.

Initially I thought I was Transgender but I have found myself to land on Gender Fluid/ Non-Binary as a more accurate description of Me.

 I am thankful to have finally made peace with myself but I fear of what is to come. I am in a relationship with a wonderful woman, we have lived together for over 2 years, we have a young child together and are engaged to be married next year. I am very happy with my family life!
 The only problem is that I am forced to present as masculine 100% of the time and it honestly makes me feel oppressed. I have hinted at wanting to present slightly more feminine to my SO in the past but it has always ended in an argument. She even told me once that she is not attracted to femininity. I understand her reasoning and I cannot change what she is attracted to but it leaves me feeling like I am not good enough to be with her. I desperately want to stay with her but I NEED to be free to be myself, I cannot hold back any longer.

 Ultimately, I am ready to come out to her and hope that she will understand. I had planned to take her to a quiet spot where it can be just us two and hand her a coming out letter. I feel like I would be able to express things more deeply over a letter than actually speaking directly to her.

2020-10-08 22:05:53,j7mlu5,0,1,"Hey friends! 

I just wanted to share something that happened to me yesterday that’s still making me smile :) 

My parter and I went to our local elections office to register to vote since we just moved to a new state, and for the first time ever I had the courage to put “X” in the gender field. Naturally the second we submitted our paperwork to the elderly woman behind the desk I started sweating bullets, but I kept my cool knowing the state I moved to is pretty cool about gender identity stuff. 

Unfortunately for me the elderly lady behind the desk had to call her manager over to help, and after a little bit of their conversation the manager looked at me and said “[AGAB] right?”  and with a sinking stomach I just nodded, because I thought if I opened my mouth I’d start crying. I started crying anyway of course, and felt like THE biggest stupidest loser standing there in the elections office blubbering.

It hurts me so

To see them mistreat you this way

They think that they can insult you by calling you gay

They disrespect you down to your very name

All the same

You allow it

I want to fight back but the way you look at me

It tells me to leave it be

I wish they would use your pronouns

But we know their opinions on the matter

Your dead name, your dead pronouns, they resound with a clatter

I applaud you for being one not easy to shatter

All the same

I break down for you

I take on the pain that seems to slide right by you

And I love you

You never seem to loose

But all the same

Don’t they see in this life you get to choose

You are not male, you are not female

They say in life you are going to fail

But if anyone is going to fail

It will not be you who has carved their own identity

And that is the one thing they will never see

In life, they say fly like a butterfly, sting like a bee

My darling I am sorry they won’t truly see you as I do

All the same

One day you will be comfortable in your body

Once a prison, you will now reclaim

And you shall take on the world

\- Knowing that I would feel uncomfortable if I had bigger breasts than I do, and if they were too big for emotional comfort (not a matter of hurting your back), I would want a breast reduction surgery. Luckily mine are fairly small and I'm fine with them lol.

\- Cringing a bit when my full name is used (it's distinctly feminine) as opposed to my nickname, which  is gender neutral.

\- Cringing when someone imposes gender roles on me or someone else unsolicited.

\- Disliking the idea of going on hormonal birth control one day not only because I'm not so sure how healthy that is long-term, but I also don't like the idea of excess female hormones being pumped into me.

At this point, I'd managed to clean up my shit, and started feeling much better about almost everything.

He said that ""finding your gender is overrated anyway :-)"" and later brought it up. I said nothing else out of anxiety, but he told me I didn't need to pigeonhole myself based on my lack of interest in stereotypically girly things (e.g. I have had a doll once, ever, and I shredded it.) and that I could be female and still happy.

He's aware that I go by Jay to most people, and that I use they/them pronouns. He asked me about it once, and I, freezing up, said ""Oh, I don't really care, call me whatever,""

My partner is officially 1 week on T, yesterday (yay!) and we're getting married tomorrow (double yay!).

Not really knowing whether or not he's supportive worried me, especially since he gets defensive if i try to talk to him about my gender or how i feel in general. I decided to ask what he thought about me going for top surgery, and he told me he wanted my mental health to be better first, and that, from his point of view, I dealt with dysphoria just fine before coming out. For a bit of context: i came out a couple months ago, and was diagnosed with depression shortly after. He continued by asking why i couldn't ""be happy and normal, like how you are with your friends"" around him and mum. At this point i was ready to give up on the conversation, and told him I'd hoped for his support during my transition. He said that it was a lot to ask for.

I'm AFAB and about six months ago my cycle changed (likely just due to getting older) and now I'm feeling and seeing my hormonal fluctuations every month a lot. I used to be a small A all the time, now I swell up to nearly a C a week or two per month and that causes me lots of dysphoria. 

Having a pretty small chest is important to me - I really liked that I could essentially get myself flat with a sports bra instead of a binder, plus the mood swings really suck. But I'm worried that the only thing that would stabilize the hormonal fluctuations - birth control - would just create even more swelling. How have other folks dealt with this? Has a progesterone only pill helped at all? Have you found any other solutions, aside from top surgery?

A while ago, I had to think about what  ""male"" and ""female"" even mean, because a very good friend of mine came out as female to male transgender (excuse me if I'm getting some terminologies wrong, I just recently started educating myself about this topic). 

I came to the conclusion, that I don't have a real sense of what being ""male"" is even supposed to feel like. I'm certainly somewhat okay with the body I have, but I'm not sure anymore how much I fit into what is generally percieved as male traits. 

I didn't think much of this because of course I gonna have these kinds of thoughts when a very good friend of mine is going through transition. But in the last few weeks, these things have literally kept me awake at night.

Out of a random whim, I decided to take one of those of course \*very scientifically accurate online quizzes\* (tm). At first, it was just for the fun of it. But a certain question had me stop and think for a very long time. ""Do you sometimes feel like the opposite gender?"". Like, shit, do I? I'm not even sure if I feel like my assigned gender. I couldn't come to a conclusion what exactly I even feel like. I didn't have a single idea what feeling male or female was supposed to be. 

Of course the obvious answer to this is therapy. I'm absolutely aware of that. But that's a very big step to take, even if it can't really hurt. 

The more I thought about this, the more I came to the conclusion, that I somewhat feel like I don't want people to percieve me as anything. Like a story that people listen to because of its contents and not because of its cover, if that makes any sense at all. 

I've started an experiment with my closest circle of friends. I've asked them to use ""Xe"" in refference to me for a while, just to see what it feels like. Can't hurt, right? It's not been going on long enough to really have a conclusion, but it certainly doesn't feel \*wrong\* and I kind of feel like... it's hard to tell, but I don't feel pressured to act ""male"" in front of them and for the most part, it's kind of relieving.

Like a story that people listen to because of its contents and not because of its cover, if that makes any sense at all. \n\nI\'ve started an experiment with my closest circle of friends. I\'ve asked them to use ""Xe"" in refference to me for a while, just to see what it feels like. Can\'t hurt, right? It\'s not been going on long enough to really have a conclusion, but it certainly doesn\'t feel \\*wrong\\* and I kind of feel like... it\'s hard to tell, but I don\'t feel pressured to act ""male"" in front of them and for the most part, it\'s kind of relieving. \n\nAnyway, to bring this huge mess of a ramble to an end: Can anyone in any way help me with this because I\'m god damn lost.   \n\n\nTL;DR: Kind of lost, might be enby, lots of self-questioning thoughts, please help me sort them.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': ""I'm kind of lost, would appreciate your thoughts"", 'created': 1602320726.0}"

So I’m still trying to figure out my pronouns, and if I’m being really honest I’m decently comfortable with he or they pronouns but strongly prefer they. Whenever they/them is used for me it just feels so right and affirming, but it’s not like people using “he” is a huge deal to me either. I get it, I present fairly masculine a lot of times (especially when I have to wear scrubs at work) and I don’t fault them for assuming. 

I’ve been introducing myself exclusively with they/them for a couple months now because it feels like if I don’t people just won’t use they at all for me. But I’ve also noticed so many times when I introduce myself with they people still default to he, and then I have to decide if I want to correct them. At my stage in training, the people I work with are often directly in charge of my grade, so there is a weird power dynamic at play. And while I’ve never felt like there would be any repercussions for me standing up for myself it feels almost like I’m being pushy and I can’t shake the feeling that I would be better off just not making waves. The few times people have actually affirmed they/them for me have been amazing, but the rest of the times I end up noticing it but I don’t usually feel like using the mental energy to correct them.

So I guess I’m just trying to make sure I’m not crazy here, and to see if anyone has any experience with something similar and what you’ve done to combat that.

I want to come out to my parents too now, but I'm a lot  less sure about how they'll respond. They're both overtly homophobic  (complaining when there's a gay couple on TV etc) but I came out to them  as bi when I was 17 and they responded along the lines of ""We don't  agree but you are free to make your own choices regarding who you date""  sort of thing, so I while I'm worried they won't be supportive, I'm  pretty confident their reaction won't be *violently* negative (e.g. cutting contact with me, or stopping their financial support for uni).

I  want to come out because I want to be closer to them and I think the  only real way for me to do that is to actually be honest with them and  to be myself around them. I'm aware that it might backfire, but I think  it's a risk I'm willing to take.

2020-10-11 04:49:44,j8z8ko,2,1,"here’s a list of terms and why I am not satisfied with using them as alternatives

trixic- nblw (can be exclusive or not) keyword or not, implying could have attraction to men, doesn’t work as an alternative, makes sense though, it is the enby equivalent of sapphic not lesbian

feminamoric- exclusive attraction to women, works decently but the enby imclusive definition of lesbian includes attraction to enbies, not including some like demi-guys, guys, etc. but can include gender-fluid, and people who are both man and woman because of the man part, so this term is decent but isn’t the best as an alternative term for lesbian

nomasexual, not attracted to binary men, lesbians also aren’t attracted to demi-guys, they aren’t binary men, so this doesn’t work either

nominsexual, attraction to non-masculinity, this can include attraction to men, doesn’t work

womasexual- like feminamoric, but can be used by any gender, so even worse

feminsexual, doesn’t work for similar reasons that nominsexual doesn’t work

and probably a few others I’m missing


and now here’s the term that does seem to work as “a label that uses a similar/same definition as the way the enby inclusive definition of lesbian is defined without using the word lesbian”

and that word is femmesexual aka venusexual- exclusive attraction to women, feminine non-binary people, and 100% androgynous non-binary people or attraction to women and lunarians

I’m very lucky in that respect.

I don’t view my sex as a danger or a hinderance. I never have. Maybe that’s because I subconsciously thought that comments made about women didn’t apply to me. So I couldn’t possibly have internalized misogyny, could I? I’ve seen detrans women say that they wanted to be trans because they were assaulted and hated their parts. And even though that doesn’t apply to me, I still have this little TERF voice in my head saying that I’m not really non-binary. It’s just misogyny.

If I were to start appearing more androgynous and more queer, that would make me more likely to be harassed or assaulted. People in my area hate LGBT people much more than they hate or don’t respect women.

So on one hand I can just exist, kind of really uncomfortable with things, but still relatively fine and most importantly just... not stand out or cause trouble for people, or I can tell people that I really sorta am not female at all and i want they/them pronouns and just put myself out there and just straight up hand people one of my biggest weaknesses on a silver platter and hope and pray they're nice about it..? 

I already dont have a lot of friends, pretty much like two and an acquaintance and I'm really hard to be friends with in general so just adding to the potential pile of reasons to not be friends with me is uh... like, rationally i can say that if they dont accept me for who i am then they never wanted to be my friends in the first place, but practically, I am going to go insane if I lose those two friends I've managed to find. 

Even if they were nice about it, how the heck do I iust bring something like this up, I cant just be like ""oh what a wonderful weather were having, by the way, I lack a defined gender and require you to change the pronouns you've been calling me for a solid year now kthx bye."" Or can I? Is that how it's done? I dont know, please help.

(Just ranting that isn't really relevant to my desperate pleas for some advice)

Last part of this is about changing my name, which sorta relates to whether or not it's even worth it to tell people.

Eh.. yeah. So, again, unless I literally want to slap something as personal as my gender on officialdocuments for anyone to read and instantly know and judge me,  and not even my actual gender but some fucked up parody of it, which I really dont, cause it's no business of the fucking state how I identify thank you very much, I'm screwed. This isn't even really a question I just want someone to tell me ""damn that's sucks bruh"" unless there is some ancient ritual that can be used to fix that whole mess. Also while my country isn't the worst when it comes to LGBTQ stuff in general, it's very much that mentality of ""if you're nice and quiet and dont ask for basic human rights, we'll consider giving you the bare minimum of respect. "" its obviously not all people, but that added with the obsessively gendered language makes me really just want to burn this place down sometimes. Yeah.

I'm just tired and frustrated and I want something to change cause I'm lowkey really sick of just trying to stay quiet so I don't make life harder for myself when it's somewhat working out if i just ignore all the uncomfortable bad feelings it's great. I'm really scared though cause uhhhh, tsk, people are dicks and I'm extremely sensitive and vulnerable to the point of using an entirely different reddit account cause I'm paranoid about someone finding out haha.

I’m just joining this subreddit and I’m hoping for some feedback! My name is Jax! For context, I’m amab and am attracted to men, and have recently started dating for the first time since coming out as an enby! Here are my thoughts and I would love to know if others have felt this way, and have any advice! 

I’ve been feeling really confused about how I express my gender in relation to my romantic life. I feel really comfortable and empowered presenting more feminine and wearing makeup and stuff like that, but at the same time, i know that one consequence of that is that many men are intimidated by me or less interested in me or not attracted to my femininity. I think I just feel confused about what that means for me long term and if I’ll ever have a partner that allows me to be exactly the way I am. I’ve been on dating apps and I’ve found myself presenting as more masculine on them (ie avoiding posting pics where I’m wearing makeup) and then when I consider going on dates, I don’t think I would feel comfortable wearing makeup around potential partners because I don’t want them to lose interest in me, but I also know that I don’t want a partner who’s transphobic.

2020-10-12 02:56:33,j9j03o,3,1,"Hi there. 

My 12 year old has expressed their disinterest in feminine things and generally wears sporty sweatpants stuff, has short hair considers themselves non-binary. We are supportive and loving and I generally find and offer clothing to support them.

Tonight, they mentioned they didn’t want their breasts to develop any further. This isn’t a first time mention, but it was more focused. Worried how much work it will be to “get rid of them” as an adult, prefers tight sports bras. They’ve recently started slumping too, which I associate with not wanting to show their chest. I could be off about that, tho. Both sides of the family have large chests as females, and they are developing.

I’ve discussed both binders and hormone blockers with them, and am just wondering if I should offer a binder or go straight to blockers to give them some time to figure it out. 

Any advice here? Hormone blockers look to have great efficacy for what they are wanting to slow, I just don’t want to do anything that would have poor long term effects on their health.

In my generation, there wasn’t the option to block, so part of this could be my own BS.

One issue that often came up was gender equality. And as a queer person myself, for the first time I noticed that this issue is almost always constructed around the traditional gender binary - i.e. gender equality for women in contrast to men.

So I wondered:
- What does gender equality mean to all of you? Whether that's in relation to society, your workplace, laws, community - any of it.  What would equality feel like for you? Do you think women's rights should be solidified first or should yours and theirs be developed in tandem? 

I personally feel like there's a lot of intersection between identities here. But I wanted to know if you'd share your thoughts with me.

She doesn't really like the ""gender norms"" and ""gender roles"" and doesn't really view gender as that important, and has therefore decided that my identity is just me wanting to not conform to gender norms either. 

I don't know how to explain it to her and would appreciate advice.

I've been dressing androgynously (not on purpose, I just wore clothes I felt comfortable wearing and they just happened to be androgynous) since I was in fifth grade, I'm in eleventh now.  
  
I began feeling romantic attraction with mild and inconsistent sexual attraction when I was 14, and I came out as a lesbian (I also figure I'm somewhere on the asexual spectrum, though I don't feel like I really need to come out in that regard unless it's to a future partner).  
  
It's been a while, and the dust has mostly settled. I've been adapting to the changes in my mental chemistry day by day. But there's been other stuff going on behind the scenes that I haven't put much though into until recently.  
  
I have practically zero ""feminine"" interests, and practically zero female friends. My breasts look and feel unnatural to me, though I've had them for years. I had pretty long hair, but that started to make me anxious too, so I had it cut short.  
  
I don't feel like I'm transgender. Actually, that's a big subject.  
  
Pronouns are one thing that don't bother me. I'm perfectly fine with being referred to with she/her pronouns. I'm ok with being referred to as a girl (for the most part). I'm used to it. That's what makes me doubt that I even fit in here. And it's also why I know I'm not trans: I wouldn't be comfortable with only being referred to as he/him. I have a somewhat androgynous voice over the internet, so when people assume I'm a guy I sometimes just roll with it. But I wouldn't like being primarily referred to with those pronouns in my day to day life by everyone.  
  
Since I've cut my hair, I've been feeling a lot more confident. I've taken a ton more selfies (lol), and I've just felt happier overall.  
  
But I also want to start binding my chest. I've found a binder online, and I plan on getting it soon. My only concerns would probably be breathing since sports bras (which I have worn exclusively since I started wearing bras) already make it semi-difficult for me to breathe. I guess this is the place to ask whether full length or half length ones are better for breathing (I'm on the chubby side, so fit is also a concern).

Maybe because my dad used to use it as an insult... even though I'm literally female. But that stuck with me forever and now as an adult I still have identity issues. 

I was talking to my therapist and she asked if I've ever had any identity issues and asked how I view myself. So I was honest and I told her about my feelings towards myself.

I hate being curvy and having boobs and since I hit puberty I've wanted to have top surgery, I still do. I like to dress in baggy clothes and I prefer my face when I loose weight because I have quite masculine features. But the thing is I dont want to be a man, I just dont want to be a woman.

She told me that maybe I should get some secondary therapy for the way I'm feeling about my identity. But I'm terrified of doing so. My dad is incredibly xenophobic. My mum is internally but she just says ""I just dont get it"" (referring to trans people).

And to top it off I have a straight cis boyfriend who I dont think would be very open to the idea of me having lived with a secret gender identity crisis my whole life. 

I think I might be nonbinary but maybe I'm not, maybe it's just self hate and I wont be happy whatsoever. I'm scared to even start asking these questions.

And that’s kind of where I am right now. If one more high schooler asks me which middle school I go to, I think what’s left of my self-esteem is going to shrivel and die. At the same time, I'm *really* not into the usual tricks for maturing your look as a woman - heels, fitted clothing, heavier makeup, etc. I'm comfortable with my masculinity, but I’d also like to look older. So, any advice for appearing older while maintaining a mostly androgynous look? Generally speaking, what changes in wardrobe or self-styling can a person make to age themselves up a bit in terms of appearance?"", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'How to look older if androgynous?', 'created': 1602628947.0}"

For a few months now I have been questioning my gender identity. I am AFAB and I had always presumed I was a girl/cisgender because I liked dressing feminine (I realize now this has nothing to do with my gender identity). Once realizing this wasn’t essential to being a woman, I began to question (still doing this) if I really felt connected to my identity as a woman, and I’ve started to realize I don’t. And with learning more about gender, I’ve come to see that all of the things I previously associated with femininity/womanhood (pregnancy, periods, motherhood, wearing bras, etc.) have nothing to do with being a woman and other people experience these things who aren’t women. Furthermore, I’m rejecting the gender binary and trying to learn more about gender to have a better idea of myself and the world around me. Overall I’ve just started to realize that I have no justification for my identity as a woman other than my previous misconceptions of dressing femininely and being a lesbian (but now I’ve learned there are NB lesbians and people of all genders can dress fem). Does anyone have any helpful resources or personal anecdotes to help? I’m currently just swimming in a mess of self doubt/insecurity about if I still REALLY feel like I am a woman. I’ve been specifically researching about non binary identity because it seems to be the most fitting label. I like to dress fem, but at the end of the day I’m not sure if I think I’m a woman.

2020-10-14 04:35:27,jatzba,13,1,"I generally consider myself to be a nonbinary woman, but demigirl also fits. I prefer strangers to assume I’m a woman rather than a man. I’ve been on estrogen for quite a few years, and basically everyone I meet assumes I’m a cis woman. I use she/they pronouns, so almost everyone calls me she, which is fine. However, I am far from what anyone would call “femme.” I wear my hair short, dress in mostly men’s clothes or masculine style, I don’t shave, wear makeup, or participate in many other feminine activities. Most people assume I’m a butch lesbian (which makes it really hard to date men goddamnit). 

A big part of my transition was taking on every single feminine thing I could (because that’s what you *do* when you transition mtf!! /s) and trying to fit into the box of being a binary trans woman before finally acknowledging that I didn’t have to be or do the things that didn’t fit my identity. While it was a roundabout way of figuring out I was nb, I feel like there are probably some others who relate. Ultimately, this culminated in me going super hard femme, figuring out that didn’t work for me and wasn’t who I was, and then drifting back towards masc presentation pretty significantly. 

So I feel weird calling myself transfemme because I’m not femme. For some reason, I feel like the term trans masc is exclusively for AFAB NB folks. Now that I’m writing that out it sounds like a dumb reinforced binary that NBs would hate. (Basically the “I like nbs but only the girl nbs” meme.) 

Anyway, long story short, I think I have my answer and I’m going to call myself trans masc.

Hi there. I’m J, a writer and filmmaker currently developing a series in which the lead happens to be a non-binary character. 

While I don’t identify as non-binary, I do want to make sure that this script is working, and isn’t just a random cis person’s stab in the dark. Since I don’t know many non-binary people in the “real world” (and don’t want to come off to them as tokenising), I’d love to get the thoughts of r/nonbinary on whether this script is working, from your perspective. Obviously, I’m mainly posting this to get thoughts on the lead character, but please mention anything else you have thoughts on.

The script is set in a sci-fi apocalyptic wasteland, and as someone interested in post-gender landscapes, I thought it was a place where a non-binary lead character would be fit perfectly. While the character has been fully conceptualised as non-binary from the beginning, this fact is largely incidental to the character. Gender simply never comes up, at least in this first episode. 

Part of the reason I’m putting this up is that I’m also sending out a casting call for the lead role soon. I’ll be trying to find a non-binary actor, and was wondering if this community had any advice on what pitfalls to potentially avoid, or things I should focus on when casting from such a relatively small pool.

If you’ve made it this far, thank you for reading through all this, and I’d really love to hear your thoughts. Art can only be allowed to grow when many voices are heard, so really, really, thank you. Script is linked below.

I’ve been on this sub for a long time, and I’ve always been floored by the beautiful, wonderful people who post here.

I guess I’ve been struggling a lot with figuring out how to express myself. I’m AMAB, and while most people in my family tie me to that, fortunately my partner and friends have been supportive in the year since I came out to them.

There’s a look a really wish I could pull off, but I don’t have the body, or the hair, or any of it, and it makes me really upset, tbh. I despite being tied down by my gender, and I just don’t know how to take steps toward how I wish I looked. 

I think one thing that’s been so hard for me is that I know exactly how I want to look, and there’s no way on earth my body could look like that. :/

Hi there. I’m J, a writer and filmmaker currently developing a series in which the lead happens to be a non-binary character.

While I don’t identify as non-binary, I do want to make sure that this script is working, and isn’t just a random cis person’s stab in the dark. Since I don’t know many non-binary people in the “real world” (and don’t want to come off to them as tokenising), I’d love to get the thoughts of r/nonbinary on whether this script is working, from your perspective. Obviously, I’m mainly posting this to get thoughts on the lead character, but please mention anything else you have thoughts on.

The script is set in a sci-fi apocalyptic wasteland, and as someone interested in post-gender landscapes, I thought it was a place where a non-binary lead character would be fit perfectly. While the character has been fully conceptualised as non-binary from the beginning, this fact is largely incidental to the character. Gender simply never comes up, at least in this first episode.

Part of the reason I’m putting this up is that I’m also sending out a casting call for the lead role soon. I’ll be trying to find a non-binary actor, and was wondering if this community had any advice on what pitfalls to potentially avoid, or things I should focus on when casting from such a relatively small pool.

If you’ve made it this far, thank you for reading through all this, and I’d really love to hear your thoughts. Art can only be allowed to grow when many voices are heard, so really, really, thank you. Script is linked below.

I've asked them to call me Alex and boy were they mad. They said they are offended because they chose my name and they'll always call em that name even though I don't want that name. They say I'm not letting them have any happiness because of the idea of changing my name to something 'boyish' even though it's not either. It's both. They also said they don't believe that shit and I only call myself that because ""some other person decided to be a girl"", that I'm taking away their happiness by taking away the name they chose for me like how my sibling changing how the name was spelt made them sad.

They even thought I needed counselling only for the name change and not the past stuff that happened. 

Fast forward and I being up I'm starting to tell them I might be non binary and they weren't happier. ""want me to treat you like a boy now?! Cus you will regret it"" being one along with the usual ""you'll always be [not preferred name)]. Call yourself that online but not with me.

Continue and I hear something I've heard before that I now see as not good.

""I swear I'm gonna slap you"".

So I snapped and said ""then do it""

Shouted in my face, mum broke us up then proceeded to tell ME off. I even told her this is verbal abuse and wanted to say this is toxic but it wasnt great.

I'm now here, wanting to cry because all I wanted was to test out one name, and to test out they/them. That's all I wanted and now I'm apparently losing respect because of something that makes me ahppy and I'm testing but like.

I don't know what to do. They still call me by the name, they still scare me.

I wanted to move with my friend in the future, but I wanna get out. And I can't leave now because I'm afraid of being independent and i don't know why.

I figured I would post this here, since it makes sense to me that lots of AMAB nonbinary people would do small doses perhaps for similar reasons.

It feels right and good and correct to call myself Agender/nonbinary. So why do I question what I feel? Why can't I just feel confident in my gender 💯 of the time like cis people do??

On one hand, I love being agender. Falling in line with the term woman feels ok, but only like a borrowed jacket. It's just not my gender.

2020-10-17 17:52:45,jczqqw,2,1,"Hi all,

I am having top surgery soon, and I am starting to feel worried like I am perhaps making a mistake. I’m not worried that I would REGRET having surgery but I am having conflicting feelings. 

I have always (8 years or so) been envious of ftm folks. I look at their chests and think “must be nice!” I think of all the freedom I would have with a flat chest and all the things I could do if I had one: run to the store without putting on a bra/binder; wear a fucking tank top; wear any color that isn’t black (probably wouldn’t though lol); wear clingy fabrics; look at myself in photos without just seeing how stupid boobs look on me etc 

But at the same time, I have been spending a lot of time with myself since quarantine and I am getting used to the way my body looks in the mirror. I know I have “nice boobs” and know that they look good on me. And they’re fine objectively as long as I’m not out in the world. But as soon as I go outside ... I am constantly aware of my boobs. If I’m not binding I feel like I look stupid and hate to look at my reflection. And if I AM binding, my back kills. 

I also feel some type of way about them when I am having sex, too. I find I’m so focused on them and how I might look feminine to my partner and I can’t think about much else. 

I understand that nobody can tell me if this is the right choice, but hopefully someone has also felt similar and can give me some insight.

2020-10-18 05:20:57,jdala0,2,1,"I posted here before already as someone who's questioning, and since then I've gone through being cool w my gender, growing my hair out and being comfortable leaning on my feminine side. But there's still that twinge of jealously whenever I see someone who looks really androgynous or even male passing. It's so tiring fluctuating this way, I just want to be comfortable. 
It's not even that unpleasant so I don't want to call it dysphoria since it's not that painful or life changing or anything. Just frustrating and tiring, like a minor inconvenience that nags at me from time to time. 

I don't even want a label, nor be justified to be called an enby since I don't even know if it's what this is. 
It's like I'm pretty sure I'm female, I don't think I'll feel comfortable being called male, yet I feel like it would've been easier if I had been born one. 
Then again, if I had been born extremely masculine, I might be just as frustrated as I am now. 
And as I type this, its started feeling more like 'I won't mind being born as' instead of 'i want to be born as' and I feel like I made a big deal out of it for nothing. I can't gauge my feelings at all, it just seems like it's changing all the time. 

Am I just confused? Am I just blowing this out of proportion? Is this just 'the grass is always greener on the other side'? Or a hormone thing?
I have a tendency to want to do or be something I'm attracted to(?), is this what it is?

2020-10-19 02:27:49,jdtgpy,2,1,"Hello, it's me \~

I'm bad at beginnings but good at lyrics, so I thought I'd start out this way. I've just recently ""come to terms"" with me being enby. While this gave me moments of wonderful euphoria which I wouldn't trade in for anything, it also brought up new problems of course. I can deal with most of them, but for others I could really use some advice from folks who have more experience than I do.

The first (and I believe for many people including me, biggest) problem is outing. I've of course talked to my partner and they're making an effort to use my pronouns and educate themselves about not only being Non Binary but also LGTBQ+ in general. They said the scope of this whole thing probably didn't sink in completely yet, but after some early trouble, we're fine now and that's great.  
I believe the biggest issue is, german isn't as easy as english when it comes to the whole pronoun thing. Them/They doesn't work out at all for example, which is why I'm using Xem/Xe. The ""german version"" of this does sound... weird to most people though. This lead to a very fun conversation when I talked to our raid lead about possibly outing myself in the group to not be misgendered for 2-3 hours a day on raid days. They basically told me nobody is probably going to adjust to my pronoun, because it's so different and I shouldn't make my happiness dependent on a pronoun anyway.

Because of this, I feel very unsure about further outing myself and asking people to use my pronoun. There are of course awesome people in my life, who didn't have any problems telling me they're going to give it their best effort to not misgender me. But of course my head is telling me tales about how rarely anybody is going to adapt to it because ""they're probably just going to think I'm weird"".

Another thing would be how I work with the first problem. There are people who are very good in basically telling you they support you while giving you the backhand, I noticed. To stay at the example mentioned above, our raidlead acted very sympathetic and nice about everything, but what they said was a slap in the face nonetheless. I'm not sure if I should be ""grateful"" and not call them out on it, because I feel like that would make me the ""attacker"". It's very difficult. 

And lastly (I've mentioned this one before, but no matter how much validation I get, it still sticks) I sometimes feel like I'm not ""enby enough"". Like ""Shouldn't I be more unhappy with myself?"". ""Shouldn't I feel more dysphoria?""... stuff like that, I think you get it. Validation is very nice and I honest to gosh nearly cried because of the nice commentary under my photo I posted the other day, but I wish there was a way for me personally to deal with this kind of problem, without having to ""seek attention"". 

Damn, I'm really good at rambling. If you made it this far, you have my respect and my thanks. Grateful for any comments one way or the other :3

&amp;#x200B;

2020-10-19 14:23:58,je2juz,3,1,"I’m 23 years old and I recently came out as a mostly femme non-binary/genderqueer person. A lot of the terminology confuses me though and I chose those because they “feel” right if that makes sense. I tend to really over think things and find myself wondering if it’s my anxiety this week or if it’s just me. Unfortunately I won’t know until this period of depression/anxiety ends cause my brain hates me.

Anyways, I chose non-binary because it feels like I barely believe in a binary? Does that make sense? Like I sorta ascribe to the ‘gender is a social construct’ but also don’t because of transgender people who have one gender. But in myself it just feels unnatural to just “be” girl or boy because I just am me. Lola. I’ve stuck to she/they. But is that a cop out? Like is it wrong to also identify with the female gender because that’s who I’ve always been or? It just feels weird to “throw away” that history I guess? But also freeing?

Since then I’ve been looking into boxers and just that feeling of freedom, but I also have like an almost debilitating anxiety about it. I feel like my friends and family will think I’m making it up and altogether I guess I’m super stressed about how people will see me. Also!!! I have a boyfriend. And I can feel myself becoming sensitive to certain small things said. Like ‘you’re my woman’ in a joking way. And I’ve told him but like I told him in a very awkward way like a “of course you don’t have a problem with it” way. And he was alright and said no matter what my gender identity was he wouldn’t love me any less which is super comforting. And he said I could buy the boxers he wears and was open but I’m not sure like how comfortable he really is? And like how “far” I could take it.

Because I desperately want a binder and boxers and suits and to feel... “not woman”. Ambiguous. Or manly. Extremely not what I’ve looked like over all these years. I just wanna look like the me I’ve always wanted to be? Androgynous, alternative, comfortable in my body... idk. This came off more as a rant or... something along those lines but I was just wondering if anyone else felt like this? Or feels like this? Especially after recently feeling like I had to come out and say it. Also isn’t to feel non-binary to accept binaries? Idk. I think I’m gonna stick to genderqueer.

Also being a second generation African makes it weirdly so much harder like I knowwwww my family will hate it. And I feel like I can’t “be” while being home? Or even anywhere close to home? Like I constantly feel like I need to completely escape the life I’m living to live the life I want to. And it feels unhealthy. Like very runaway esq. but yeah. Also? I’m too broke to be genderqueer lmao? Does that sound weird? Like binders and boxers and clothes that fit me right with my big boobs and slightly chubby body. Meh. Might be excuses.

This whole year has been such a roller coaster for me. From finding out about my ADHD, bipolar disorder, worsening depression, and exploring my hidden traumas. And to add to that, the struggle of trying to figure out my identity. During the summer, I contemplated the idea that I might be a transwoman. And then, the idea that I might just actually be gender fluid or non-binary. 

I’ve been struggling a ton with gender dysphoria. However, one thing I noticed that I don’t have in common with many trans women is that I don’t suffer with body dysphoria *(at least relating to genitalia or any other body parts. I’ve always been self-conscious about my weight but that’s a topic for another time I guess lol).* I’m fine with having a penis, looking at the mirror doesn’t ruin my day, and I don’t particularly feel the need to present femme. I do have a love for drag and I’d love to get into it! I feel comfortable presenting as a sexy showgirl and as a handsome young man, if that makes any sense?

I also read up a lot and saw that many trans women feel trapped inside their body, but I don’t feel that?? However, just as I don’t feel like a woman, I also don’t feel like a MAN. It’s very confusing for me. Am I depressing feelings? Is my brain being a total dick to me?

2020-10-21 15:28:47,jff0x4,1,1,"Hi hello, I think I might be non-binary but it’s complicated bc.. that’s what being queer is like for me I guess 😅

So. I’m afab, and femininity has rarely felt uncomfortable for me. She/her pronouns don’t make me uncomfortable. Calling myself a woman feels fine. I love being my girlfriend’s girlfriend and her future wife. I went to a women’s college, I connect with the shared experiences of women under the patriarchy, I love women as a feminist and as a lesbian (a lesbian who is into women and non-binary people and has no genital preferences, to be queer- I mean, clear).

A few months ago, my girlfriend, who is trans, asked me if I’ve ever examined my gender, bc most of my friends and loved ones are non-binary or trans and, yknow, like attracts like. And I said, yeah I have, but I think I’m cis and I’m just attracted to people as people, and happen to not really be attracted to men (I’ve dated several people who were male-presenting but came out as non-binary or trans while dating me. Maybe I’m just a safe space kind of cis person?)

But I’ve thought about it A Lot since she asked me that. Another partner of mine used they/them for me one night (with their non-binary partner also present, they got pronouns mixed up) and I felt really squirmy. My girlfriend gently corrected them and I agreed with the correction. But.. it’s the same kind of squirmy I got when someone called a group I was in “a group of lesbians” when I identified as bi. It’s like. Imposter syndrome squirmy. 

I’m def not trans masc. I am not a masculine person, I don’t like appearing that way, I’m not into masculinity in general (except.. muscley women. Which can still be femme? I don’t like manly men dudes or any people who totally eschew femininity). But I’m also not.. standard woman? When I think of not being gendered at all that sounds appealing, and when I’m gendered in a Gay Woman way that is also appealing. 

I don’t know, I’ve seen some people say their gender is dyke and I like that. And I love the idea of like.. fae/faer pronouns, too, but I can’t imagine anyone actually using them for me, no one around me uses neopronouns (and almost everyone I am close with is some variety of Not Cis). Also they feel kind of, I dunno, Too Different. Like they aren’t mainstream and it’d be asking a lot of people, especially in a culture where too many people don’t even respect binary trans people to begin with 😡

anyway yeah. I feel femme and fae, and def not trans masc, not even really trans I guess, not genderfluid either if gender is a male-to-female-spectrum, but like.. maybe fluid in the sense of female and also no gender, which is, not cisgender? Or is it? I don’t go for my femme appearance bc I was assigned female, I go for femme expression bc it’s what I innately like, what feels good and artistic and expressive. Which still feels like it could be cis, and so the non-binary label.. the idea of claiming it feels like I’m trying to fit somewhere I don’t belong? 

If I am cis, and just a cis woman who thinks a lot more about gender bc most of her loved ones aren’t cis, I’m fine with that, bc I don’t want to intrude in spaces that aren’t for me. But maybe I’m non-binary? Idk.

I want to change my name to represent that, but as a minor I can't without calling my attorney since my legal guardian won't approve of it. I really want to do this though since my current legal name causes me to feel a bit dysphoric, and right now I can't use my preferred name for anything when it comes to school or even some job applications, and I'd rather not have another nervous breakdown while in class this year because of my social dysphoria.

I really want to do this though since my current legal name causes me to feel a bit dysphoric, and right now I can't use my preferred name for anything when it comes to school or even some job applications, and I'd rather not have another nervous breakdown while in class this year because of my social dysphoria.

2020-10-22 07:00:38,jfutjn,0,1,"Hi all!
Recently was having a hard time trying to find comfortable clothes to wear. A few years back, I discovered men's shoes and fell in love with the feel of them. Took that a step further and decided to start shopping in the men's section of different stores I frequent. Immediately felt more at ease doing so. Ive always felt that shopping in the women's department was a bit weird and off-putting for myself. So I decided that I enjoy men's clothing. I get judged by some family members for this, but I honestly don't care what they think at this point. I'm comfortable and happy. Plus, I love my button up life!

On a side note: I'm thinking about buying men's jeans. I really want REAL pockets damn it.! 

A few years ago, I was struggling with my identity. Was i male/female? What did others see me as? Whats wrong with me &amp; why am I like this? An old friend of mine recently came out as a trans woman and was afraid of all the backlash. When I found out, I was happy that she was comfortable with herself(was a he before). I told her that regardless of who she/he was, were still friends and she's stuck with me. That I accept her for who she is regardless of what others think. I then told her that I was struggling with my own identity and don't honestly know who I am. In the last year, she has helped me realize this. I love her for everything she's helped me with and more.

I realized with her help that I'm nonbinary and damn proud of it. I haven't honestly told the rest of my family/most are strong believers of gender norms. My husband knows and accepts me for who I am &amp; I'm grateful pfor such a person and others in my life.

2020-10-24 22:48:41,jhigzm,1,1,"Potential TW: descriptions of discomfort with female anatomy

I'm AFAB and currently identifying as a cis lesbian, but I've been thinking a lot in the past few months about this and I would like an inside opinion.

For one, I have a very large chest strongly dislike having ""underboob"" when I don't have a bra on. It's not just the sweat and lack of support (strangely enough, I actually like the smell of the sweat) but a more visceral feeling that my breasts look saggy and weird.

I also have an incredibly strong aversion to my period, to the point where I got birth control to stop it even though my symptoms weren't beyond normal. It goes beyond the ""ugh"" feeling that most cis women have, and more of a primal fear and disgust at the idea. I always found it the weirdest thing when women would ""get to know their cycle"" and ""sync it with their friends"" like that was normal and almost a part of their identity.

I trained my voice to be lower because I didn't like how it sounded naturally, and I am much more comfortable with it now.

The final note is why this is marked NSFW, and that's the very strong desire for the sensation of a penis. It's not any connotation like being seen as male or the simple act of penetrating something, but *purely* the sensation of basically my clitoris but bigger and slightly less sensitive.

I know it's an LGBT thing to say ""if you're asking how to tell if you're x, you probably are!"" and for the most part I agree, but here's the thing: socially and aesthetically I'm fine with being *seen* as a woman. I'm fine with she/her pronouns. I like the aesthetic of having breasts, when they're lifted and shaped by a bra. Hell, the birth control I use is the nuva ring which works by being inserted into the vagina. Part of why I'm hesitant too is because I've wrapped so much of my identity in being a lesbian that I can't imagine not identifying as a woman.

This is the opposite of what most experiences I've heard are. Usually the body comes secondary to how you feel socially and aesthetically, but I feel like physically I was meant to be intersex whearas socially I don't care.

Ever since I was little, I've loved looking at myself in the mirror (maybe its an ego thing lol) and there's been times where I've seen myself as a different gender than what I was labeled at birth (Male), going as far as asking my parents if they were sure that I was a boy.

It almost feels like a sort of reverse-dysphoria, if that makes any sense.

Instead of my internal reality rejecting the external, my internal reality informs the way I view my physical self, regardless of how I'm presenting, and recently I've noticed that I subconsciously posture and motion in different ways depending on how I'm feeling at a perticular moment.

I hope it’s okay to ask this question here. If it’s really annoying to everyone, let me know, and I’ll delete.

So, I know someone who was born with a typically female body (god, sorry, I hope I’m using the right language to describe this!) and grew up being treated as though they’re a girl, but now they identify as nonbinary, and they are only femme presenting, which means that to everyone who’s known them for a while, they don’t present any differently than they always have.

Hey fam - I don’t even know where to begin this post. I’m a proud POC (Indigenous) living in Australia and am 19 and long story short I think I might be non-binary. I know I am definitely PAN - but my gender is something I haven’t been warranted to think about. As a black person race  and racial prejudice has always been the most violent force in my life so exploring my queerness and gender hasn’t really been explored. 

And was wondering what helped you “discover” or “realise” or really cement your gender fluidity. I won’t lie this sounds so corny but I was watching queer eye (classic) and I did almost have a epiphany moment where I was like omg I think I’m non-binary. 

I have always dated/ been attracted to  exclusively androgynous and non-binary folk. But as the gf of all my ex’s I have always felt like they were the “non binary one” which sounds so pathetic when written down. When I think about being intimate it’s always from a “male perspective” for lack of a better term. I also sometimes think/fantasize about having male genitalia. 

I feel the most comfortable in pants and baggy shirts (I’m a professional painter) so my clothes are always ready to get dirty but I also love men’s clothing. Although I do LOVE makeup! 

Im really confused and was hoping someone had some ideas/resources?

Up until then, my time on the internet was spent absorbing enbyphobic content. I always felt like I couldn't be one thing or the other. I never fit either side. 

I'm just barely 16 now, and to this day I'm still thoroughly troubled. 

I don't feel like a girl completely, but I'm definitely not a guy. There are things I love about femininity, and even more things I find comfort in with androgyny. This year, I learned about she/they pronouns. 

For the first time, I've seen something that genuinely makes sense to me. I'm not exactly 100% a girl, there's more to it. I think. 

But is that ok?

A part of me wishes I could just say that. Say that I use she/her and they/them pronouns and leave it. They both comfort me and appeal to aspects of my identity better than I could describe. They/them pronouns comfort a part of me that has always been discontented. But I have to function in a lot of gendered spaces. And quite honestly, I don't think she/her pronouns bother me. They're fine, they're a part of who I've always been. And femininity and womanhood are also very comfortable concepts to me in specific ways. 

But is that ok?

If I do say that I'm nonbinary, if I finally claim that part of myself, does that mean I have to throw it all away? Does it mean I can't exist in spaces usually put in place for women? Does it mean I can only be nonbinary, and that's it? And on the converse, if I'm just a woman, will I ever feel right? Will these feelings and discomforts about my identity ever stop? Will I ever just be able to be content with myself and feel myself? Because I don't think so. The first time I told a close friend I might be nonbinary, I remember feeling so extremely myself.  

I guess I'm just scared. And confused. I FEEL like a woman, but I also don't. Not entirely. But if I claim either label, or even the label she/they, does that mean that I no longer belong in exclusively feminine spaces? Is it possible to simply be nonbinary and simultaneously a girl??

2020-10-26 02:45:38,ji6rs7,2,1,"I am a polytheist, while I don’t work with fae I also do personally acknowledge the possible existence of fae. I just don’t quite understand why specifically the fae were used for a set of pronouns. It seems odd to me to use cultural beings as pronouns personally thus my initial reaction is a bit confused. I feel it comes from a place of ignorance so I would love to hear from people who understand the reasoning/origin of fae/faer pronouns or use them personally. I have heard it is a therian specific set while also hearing it is more about being genderqueer.

Oftentimes when I see something that is considered something that women like oder want, I cringe. 
I started working out a few months ago and I searched for exercises on Pinterest &amp; Instagram, etc. At first I tried to search for exercise videos from women because I have „the same body“. But it became a challenge. I often found videos where their butts are in 3/4 of the frame and I couldn’t see the exercise. I also searched for exercises on google and cringed also when I typed „women“. -&gt; „How to exercise for a boob lift“, „How to exercise without decreasing breast size“, „get a flat belly“, „get a big booty“, „Get smaller thighs“ etc.
I mean it’s completely okay if someone else want and likes it. I just don’t relate. 
All these trends to get a big butt or a flat belly or a thigh gap didn’t get to me. I don’t care if my breast decreases. That’s in fact something I WANT. I don’t want a flat belly. I want abs or let’s say I don’t care. I would be completely fine with belly fat. And I don’t know what’s the point of thigh gaps? I’m exercising to get bigger, not toned. 
And the point is: I relate more when I see pictures and videos of men. They look muscular and I want to look like that. I want big arms, muscle tits, etc. 
And I feel weird relating more to the „men-side“ than to the „women-side“. Because I am a woman, right?? Shouldn’t I relate to that more?

Another thing is: woman == baby machine. I feel like we are taught that being a woman means the ability to get pregnant and birthing. And this does a lot of damage bc what is if I am a woman but am infertile? Ain’t I a woman then?? Or if I don’t want one?

I don’t want children and I definitely don’t want to get pregnant and birth. It’s a terrifying thought. I feel like it’s expected of me. 
I had some conversations with my mother and it went like this:

Me: “[..] I don’t want to have a child.”
Mum: “I didn’t want one at your age but it’ll change when you get older.”

It’s only expected because I have this body.

2020-10-26 21:28:54,jinqrx,11,1," Hi everyone. My friend recently came out as non binary and wants to use they them pronouns. I'm posting here seeking a bit of advice. I tagged it as NSFW because there are mentions of suicide, etc and didn't see a ""trigger warning"" option. 

I have been best friends with Elizabeth (22) for about 12 years now. I consider Elizabeth to be my closest friend and definitely one of the people I love &amp; care about the most. 

A few weeks ago, Elizabeth told me that they no longer want to use ""she/her"" but use they/them and be officially non binary. Elizabeth told me: ""I expect my closest friends to respect this, I changed my pronouns in my Instagram bio weeks ago and you continue to use she/her"" I told Elizabeth that I don't go check my friend's Instagram bios regularly so I had no idea it was updated there but that I would definitely be mindful and use they/them in the future. Elizabeth told me that they don't plan on changing their name or appearance, keeping both a feminine name and appearance and told me not to use any feminine words to describe them (like pretty, girl, queen, etc) I agreed and said that it would be no problem and everything seemed okay. I was a bit shocked that Elizabeth chose to change pronouns solely via Instagram bio and not tell me, and still get upset with me for not respecting it. I was a bit hurt that Elizabeth didn't want to tell me personally, or talk to me about it at all, but ultimately as long as we've sorted everything out I guess it's okay.  

I'm not sure if I'm the asshole here, but it is a bit difficult for me to remember these things when I've been best friends with this person for half of my life and have never considered them to be anything but a ""girl"" until a few weeks ago. So I do screw up. I know this is my fault, but my issue is that Elizabeth gets extremely upset. 

For example, a few days ago I was with Elizabeth and another mutual friend and accidentally said ""It's up to her"" (referring to Elizabeth). I didn't even realize in the moment. Later on that day, I see Elizabeth posted on their private Instagram account about wanting to commit suicide and details about desiring to kill themselves over being misgendered today. The other mutual friend confirmed that it was because of me saying ""it's up to her"". I found this reaction to be dramatic a bit, it is clear that I love and support Elizabeth. I've used they/them plenty of times, it's not like I'm refusing to respect their pronouns. I don't understand what provoked such a reaction. 

It made me feel very nervous and upset, thinking that I'm the reason my best friend wants to actually die. I'm assuming there has to be more going on. Overall it makes me almost uncomfortable to hang out with Elizabeth because now I'm so afraid I'll slip up and use the wrong pronouns or words and cause Elizabeth to commit suicide. 

I know I need to do my part and put effort into getting it right, which I am. I just have a hard time with the fact that Elizabeth isn't more understanding; I'm a human being, I make mistakes. We've been extremely close for 12 years and it's only been a few weeks since they've switched pronouns. I'm bound to screw it up sometimes, but it's definitely not done maliciously and I hoped Elizabeth would understand this. They don't seem to and I'm not really sure what to do. 

It was a huge stressor for me to read that me accidentally using ""her"" to describe Elizabeth caused them to talk seriously about committing suicide. It definitely wasn't a joke. 

I need some advice on what to do. I love Elizabeth and want to have them in my life but I've been avoiding going to see them because I am afraid that I'll screw up and actually cause Elizabeth to kill themself. Maybe this is an over dramatic response but I'm an anxious person and I don't think I could live with knowing that essentially I killed my best friend. I also don't know if I should confront Elizabeth about it and ask them to be more understanding to the fact that it might take me some time to fully remember to use they them and avoid any feminine terms. I'm not sure if that would make me seem like an ass. I'm not sure if Elizabeth is upset because I didn't notice sooner, but I'm being 100% honest when I say that I have no reason to check anyone's Instagram bio &amp; that Elizabeth changed absolutely nothing in the way they talk, act or exist that would have made me suspect something was up &amp; they weren't comfortable being referred to as a girl.

I appreciate any advice that you guys might have. I don't have any non binary people in my life besides Elizabeth so I was hoping the Reddit community could help me out.

I don't care if people assume I'm a boy online. And hell, I'm ""obviously"" (I use this ***very*** loosely just to get my point across) female but I wouldn't get upset if different pronouns were used IRL either. So... maybe I just don't care. Cool. *But, uh.*

I recently tried to dress up way more masculine. The baggier clothes, trying to hide my chest, even looking up tutorials to see how to draw facial hair (and fake other masculine features) and then I was annoyed I was still pretty feminine afterwards.

I also wish I was taller so I could ""pass"" better between genders since I'm really short; if I *was* taller, I'd probably go back and forth.

We are conducting a study on oppression-based traumatic stress and growth among transgender adults at Alliant International University, with the goal of disseminating our findings to inform clinical treatment and policies that support trans rights.

We are seeking transgender individuals (anyone whose gender identity is different from their gender assigned at birth, including but not limited to people who identify as transwomen, transmen, nonbinary, genderqueer, agender, two-spirit and gender nonconforming) age 18 or older, fluent in English, who live in the United States to participate in a two-part online survey on transgender traumatic stress and growth. Interested participants will complete two, 30-minute surveys, 6 months apart, and will be entered into a raffle with a chance of winning a $250 Amazon gift card for completion of each survey.

This survey is being done as part of a study on oppression-based traumatic stress and growth among transgender adults at Alliant International University. We are focusing on understanding risk and resilience factors among diverse transgender individuals in order to inform clinical care and future research.

2020-10-27 21:15:59,jja4xd,6,1,"Hi all, this is my first post ever on Reddit so please be gentle if I'm in the wrong place! 

I'll try to be brief. My partner and I have a wonderful 5 (very nearly 6) year old daughter. She is sensitive and wonderful and wise wise wise beyond her years. She also has a brilliant best friend (I'll call him S) and they're currently planning to get married and have 4 children - despite our protestations that they might want to get together with other people, at the moment they're both adamant. :)

We're really good friends with the parents of S, and have been now since the kids were about 12 months old. Around 2 years ago S's mum confided in me that S's Dad identifies as a woman. At that point, only I knew outside of the marriage. Since then, and very recently their understanding of themselves has evolved and they now identify as non binary. Their preferred pronouns are they and them.  

Sorry...the background wasn't short after all! As a family they are about to come out to S and I believe the plan is to ""go public"" soon after.  I absolutely am determined to be the best damn ally this family unit could ever hope to have, but I have to admit guys, this is new new ground for me! 

My idea first off is to introduce a teddy to our little girl who is neither male nor female. This would be to give us practice at using the pronouns they and them, and to open up discussions about how this applies to people. When S's Dad (they still want to be Daddy to S) gives us the green light, we'll be ready to help our little girl assimilate the new info them.

How does that sound? I really need honest opinions and I'm totally fine with being told if I've hit the wrong note. Please please point me to resources that you think might help. I suppose I'm in a pretty rare position in that I'm trying to get this right as a parent, a friend to a wife of an enby, and an enby themselves.  In amongst all of this I also want S to feel that having an enby Dad doesn't define him to us. He's totally still just our little girl's best friend.  

I don't know what lies ahead for S in school as this becomes common knowledge in our community, but my ultimate goal here is that our little girl will be secure in her knowledge that as a family we LOVE these guys, and she'll stand with S against any prejudice he might encounter as they grow up together. 

Thinking about it, I'm also asking what would have helped you as a young child to understand what it is to be non binary? Are there any key ideas you think will help me to lay the foundations of her understanding?

so i am afab, nonbinary, a few months past a year on T, no surgeries. i’m 23. i had a physical the other day and got a breast exam, the doctor said one felt a little lumpy and she wants me to get it checked out just in case, gave me a referral to a breast health place for an ultrasound and a mammogram. when i called, i got the ultrasound scheduled but they said they don’t do mammograms on people under 25...even though it was ordered by a doctor. from the same clinic/company/whatever. a quick google search told me mammograms are almost never recommended under 40, unless you have a family history of breast cancer (i do not) in which case you can start getting them at 25. i didn’t see any information about what happens if your doctor flags a concern while you’re younger than that. 

i don’t know a lot about these procedures, i don’t know if there’s information a mammogram can give that an ultrasound can’t, i don’t really understand why the doctor ordered a mammogram in the first place if an ultrasound would be sufficient, i just don’t know. it seems like *someone* made a weird choice but i’m not sure who or what to do to advocate for myself. 

i’m putting this in trans subreddits because i know testosterone also impacts breast growth and risk of breast cancer and i don’t know how that may be interacting with this situation. i feel like that adds enough of a unique factor not to go to a women’s subreddit where more people may have breast exam experience. if there’s a specific sub people think i should ask this of, i’m open to that advice too lol.

i’m curious if anyone else on T has navigated breast cancer screenings. did your breasts get lumpy on T and did it concern your doctors? has anyone been in a situation like mine? have you had a mammogram? will an ultrasound be sufficient to screen me for any problems? i honestly don’t really even care if the clinic misgenders me or if they’re rude about it or whatever, but i do care about the actual tests being done properly and my health.",NonBinary,breast cancer screening???,1603877537.0,"{'created_utc': 1603852337, 'id': 'jjfmws', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'hello. i’m crossposting this to a few subs because i’m not very active on reddit and don’t know which trans subs are any good. sorry if this is a little long.\n\nso i am afab, nonbinary, a few months past a year on T, no surgeries. i’m 23. i had a physical the other day and got a breast exam, the doctor said one felt a little lumpy and she wants me to get it checked out just in case, gave me a referral to a breast health place for an ultrasound and a mammogram. when i called, i got the ultrasound scheduled but they said they don’t do mammograms on people under 25...even though it was ordered by a doctor. from the same clinic/company/whatever. a quick google search told me mammograms are almost never recommended under 40, unless you have a family history of breast cancer (i do not) in which case you can start getting them at 25. i didn’t see any information about what happens if your doctor flags a concern while you’re younger than that. \n\ni don’t know a lot about these procedures, i don’t know if there’s information a mammogram can give that an ultrasound can’t, i don’t really understand why the doctor ordered a mammogram in the first place if an ultrasound would be sufficient, i just don’t know. it seems like *someone* made a weird choice but i’m not sure who or what to do to advocate for myself. \n\ni’m putting this in trans subreddits because i know testosterone also impacts breast growth and risk of breast cancer and i don’t know how that may be interacting with this situation. i feel like that adds enough of a unique factor not to go to a women’s subreddit where more people may have breast exam experience. if there’s a specific sub people think i should ask this of, i’m open to that advice too lol.\n\ni’m curious if anyone else on T has navigated breast cancer screenings. did your breasts get lumpy on T and did it concern your doctors? has anyone been in a situation like mine? have you had a mammogram? will an ultrasound be sufficient to screen me for any problems? i honestly don’t really even care if the clinic misgenders me or if they’re rude about it or whatever, but i do care about the actual tests being done properly and my health.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'breast cancer screening???', 'created': 1603877537.0}"

Basically, all of the stereotypical girl things. When I turned 11, that's when I started to grow breasts. Now, at first, I was very excited to have them for whatever reason. And when they really fully grew, I was still okay with them.. sort of? I've always been very unwanting of them. Like, I absolutely hated wearing shirts that would expose them too much. I just didn't want them to be there, but I brushed it off as me being shy about them. But as of current, I've found myself very uncomfortable with them. Too uncomfortable. Right now, I'm wearing a somewhat tight shirt that I was forced to wear and I feel so INSANELY uncomfortable. It's almost like a feeling of anxiety, I don't know how to explain it.

Recently, I've met a friend who identifies as Non-binary. And this is when I started to truly question my gender, because I was always thinking to myself, ""Wow! They're so lucky! I wish I was non-binary."". And that's when I sort of realized that cisgender people don't wish they were another gender, in a sense of genuinely wanting to be able to be that other gender. Though, I've held myself back from truly identifying as Non-binary for a number of reasons.

1 - My non-binary friend says that they feel gender dysphoria, which is something that I don't feel. At least, I don't think I feel it, because I don't know what it truly feels like. 

2 - I'm fine with my breasts being there, but I just don't like other people knowing I have them. Which, again, is something that I'm sure crosses me off of the NB spectrum, possibly.

I know these are only two reasons, but I'm hoping to get an enbies opinion!! I've also questioned whether I could possibly be FtM, because I often find myself wishing that I would be referred to as he/him, but I feel the possibility that I'm non-binary is more likely.

 Hi so I've been questioning for quite a long time (like, 5-10 years) and never been feminine. I know gender presentation and identity are two different things but anyway, I've been identifying as genderfluid/nonbinary for the past few years, and as most of my acquaintances call me by my nickname, I haven't bothered trying to find a new name. 

Problem is, my native language is HEAVILY gendered (it's french) and so is my birthname. 
I cannot be out at work for several reasons, firstly because there are no neutral ways to address me, I basically would have to choose between «ma'am» and «sir», and also deal with all of my pupils reactions, and more importantly their parents and I just don't have the strength to do it.

However, I feel like my name is a barrier to better accepting myself, but I feel totally incapable of choosing a new one. And I keep thinking that I shouldn't change anyways, that I don't need to. So yeah, basically, a lot of internal conflict.

The question is, then: Have any of you enbies (and especially afab people on the transmasc side) kept their birthname, and if so, how do you deal with it in everyday life?",NonBinary,Any of you afab Nbies keep their birth name?,1603902389.0,"{'created_utc': 1603877189, 'id': 'jjklbd', 'num_comments': 5, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""VERY long post incoming, skip to the end for the actual question.\n\n Hi so I've been questioning for quite a long time (like, 5-10 years) and never been feminine.

Hey so long (life) story ahead so keep reading if only you want to..

&amp;#x200B;

 I'm a transgender person not feeling like the regular amab trans girl, or the genderqueer lesbian you see memes about on a certain other trans subreddit... I always felt trans, but in a weird way.. I'm amab, I feel mtf-like dysphoria and all that.. But beyond all this..

&amp;#x200B;

I want to be a boy..

&amp;#x200B;

I want to relate to the cool guys, stand alongside the tomboys girls at school playin  on their nintendos with the boys whenever i was young. But despite this all, I never felt okay with my own body.. I've been in denial of my teenager 'changes'  for a while during my youth, unable to talk about my voice drops and changes to my bodily hair growth.. Meanwhile, intimate stuff like relationships, sexual health all the way to the fact I didn't wanna get that one doctor checkup for circumcision because I felt insecure about that one part of my body..

&amp;#x200B;

Later on I learned to accept this, and it all jumpstarted me into a period of soulsearching and self acceptance.. What am I? What do I identify as.. Or most of all, is it acceptable for me to feel this way?

&amp;#x200B;

Originally I identified as an simple definiton, as an enby.. But I grew more and more uncomfortable with the broadness of the term as I began getting to know other likeminded-ish anomalies in the gender spectrum.. I started to accept I wanted to medically transition, but also I still didn't feel like a girl nor a neutral/third gender option..

&amp;#x200B;

So I became to realize I wanted to be masculine in a sense, still.. Originally I could only describe it as feeling like a masculinzied girl, but that didn't feel right.. I wanted to bind in a foreseeable future where I had grown more breast tissue.. I  wanted to pack   with real penile prosthetics whenever I felt like it, after a possibly upcoming vaginoplasty.. Yet I didn't want a male body, I wasn't a transmascline afab, even despite the yearning thoughts and relatedness towards the people with those or similar identities.. I  wanted to identify male in a feminized, amab body.. A bit similar like enbies identifying as neither, but wanting the opposite body transition to appear more androgynous, in a certain sense.

&amp;#x200B;

I've made a post about this a year ago like I said.. People responded positively.. But still, I feel lonely.. You see, most people when I tell them how I feel barely understand and relate.. The ones that somehow do, say they're still okay being called a transguy for afab people, and a trans women for amab.. But I don't feel that connection AT ALL..

&amp;#x200B;

So i decided to make my own definiton on it a few months ago, and I've been hoping to spread the word..  Maybe one day, someone might feel like the same, and is gonna use my named identity as a main label to identify themselvees as..

&amp;#x200B;

So this is why I'm writing this post; I've made it it's own pride flag after years of polishing it out to have it as my own identity, and I  hope by posting this, somebody will also relate and decides to use my terminology.. So here come the small descriptive texts.

&amp;#x200B;

Temgender (derived from Tom/Tomboy en Fem/Femme) is a gender identity for amab trans individuals that identify for most part, i.e by identity and expression, masculine, but feel a similar kind of dysphoria as transfeminine people might relate to, but only anatomically;  i.e body dysphoria, voice dysphoria, et cetera.. They however, don't relate nor feel as closely connected to feminity the same way amab transfeminine people might.. Opposite terminology isn't created, and I don't feel like making it as I'm not apart of said identity, but I personally theorized it to be called Fescugender (derived from Feminine and Masculine combined, so fesculine), which would be used for afabs who identifiy predominantly (partially) feminine, although wish to have a masculine body, and transition the same way transmasculine people might've transitioned, in the hope to earn that masculinized body they yearn for all these years.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

And now, here's my very fabulous, amazingly made pride flag!!

I have long term goals of this being a place to try new names, get answers to questions, and give support. There is a lot of TMI details when it comes to transition that can be hard to ask, and this is a place to openly discuss those changes, share images (18+ and NSFW when needed), and have other folks to talk it out with. Also, a community that you can hang out in and still feel welcome and valid. 

The rules right now are simple. No transphobia, no racism, no exclusionism. Questioning folks are always welcome. Binary and nonbinary trans folks welcome. There is little there yet, including people, so folks who join now can help me build the channels and roles for the best server.

hi, i’m hannah (16) and non binary! at least thats what i think i am... i’m currently very confused, but let’s start from the beginning.
i was assigned female at birth and i’m not sure if i can truly identify with that. i’m sometimes really comfortable in my femininity, at least i was in the summer, but since one month ig i’m so uncomfortable with my chest! i feel like my boobs, which aren’t even that big, ruin every outfit. when i wear a sports-bra and a big hoodie you basically can’t even tell that i have boobs...
but i still think they ruin every fit.
sometimes i really wish i were amab and then identify as non binary or be feminine...
do you know what i mean? 
but on the other side im really comfortable with using a women’s restroom or if my friends/family uses she/her pronouns. on the other hand it makes me really happy if strangers see myself as a dude and use he/him pronouns...
i feel like i am genderfluid? bc somethimes i feel very fem and other times i feel very masc...
but what does it mean, if i wish to be amab only to present more feminine? 

if i may add: i don’t have bottom dysphoria, but i do feel very insecure about my face bc i don’t really have a jawline..

They/them has been used to refer to one person for centuries. Honestly, I think saying they/them can't be singular is transphobic, and you might have good intentions but that doesn't mean what you're teaching us is okay. For you and other scholars, it's just a pet peeves, but for nonbinary people and people who are intersex it's invalidating their identity. Intersex is when someone isn't born with XX or XY chromosomes but for some reason, not many people know they exist.

2020-10-29 02:31:42,jk1xz2,3,1,"Hi Everyone. Recently I've been thinking that I'm nonbinary, and wanted to ask some questions to see if anyone can help with some issues I have. Ok here it goes

Ok so I joined this club called Gay-Straight alliance which is like an LGBT group at my school and I didn't tell my parents. I kinda told my mom that it was for a study group so i could get her to agree to pick me up from meetings. I didn't tell my dad at all. My mom is just generally kind of bigoted about things, and I am worried about my her finding out about the club and me being forced into telling her about my gender and sexuality (Bi). I haven't told my dad at all because I tried to tell him about my sexuality and he basically said,""You're straight because you made a joke about your potential future children one time."" He just didn't understand that (probly cause he's hugely religious) and definitely wouldn't understand me being nonbinary. I am doing the wrong thing by not telling them? I feel mixed emotions about it and maybe someone else's opinion can help.

Second thing, appearance. I know its not a requirement to look androgynous to be nonbinary, but I want to look that way so bad. I've been trying to grow my hair out longer and lose weight, but that's all I can do. I know this seems kind selfish and stupid, but I just wanna be able to look and dress a certain way without consequences. I've always kinda wanted to maybe try makeup or painting my fingernails, but I can't cause it would instantly out me if my family saw. And I cant really dress the way I'd like to in my mind cause I can't really go anywhere to get clothes by myself, and if I wanted to dress that way I'd basically have to change clothes every time I wanted to come into my house.

I just want to know if I’m just truly questioning, or if I actually am genderfluid/non-binary. It’s so confusing and it makes me upset because I’ve only talked to one other person about this(who identifies as genderfluid) and they told me they always thought I might be somewhere in between but didn’t feel it was their place to say that too me outright. I feel like I’m lying to myself about who I really am. I just recently (&gt;1yr)started questioning myself on my gender identity(or lack thereof I guess)

I’m 23, and biologically a female. I haven’t ever necessarily felt like a girl or a boy my entire life but always identified as female because it was easier that way. My parents never really ever pushed gender norms at me growing up- all they asked is that I was a good person. I worked on cars, played in dirt, built things with my hands, did normal household chores growing up- as did all my brothers. 

I just kind of feel lost and like reality isn’t real anymore and have no idea what to do about any of this.

i have this many doubts since i feel like i'm different from other non binary people i know: i was born a female, and i use they/them pronouns (in my native language we do not have neutral pronouns, so i use male pronouns that may work as neutral too.)
my best friends and my future partner would be the only ones who are allowed to use female pronouns and call me by my birth name.

but i think it's different. i feel like gender is not important to me. I mean, you can assume im female or male or everything you want, and i wouldn't care.
my friends get mad when someone misgenders them, while i just don't care.

if i was born as a male, i wouldn't go back to female. And from being a biologica female, i wouldn't be a man because i feel fine with being both.

looks like i want to keep my gender as a secret. but again, if someone who i don't like uses female pronouns i feel weird (in a bad way).

My mom was strictly against it. I stopped going to swimming practices because of it but I thought it was strictly because of mental illness. When I talked with my swim coach recently she had made the connection of me wanting to quit swimming and me starting to grow body hair. The only extra body hair I've been comfortable with is my beard. I obsessively shave my body hair regularly. 

When I've been in drag I've felt a bit more free. I've almost always had identity issues. Thinking of being referred by they/them has sounded good to me. Tho I  like my given name since I have the same name as a big role model in my life. I've often avoided trying to think of who I am so I'm not used to it. I like to express myself more femininely.

2020-10-31 05:18:50,jlcwcs,4,1,"So my new job has me dressing a little more feminine than I would like. Some days I don't mind it but others I find myself struggling to feel comfortable in my own skin but unsure of how to make my look more androgynous or masculine but still fit the job. I work in clothing retail as a manager and the dress code is pretty relaxed. I'm thinking maybe I just need some ideas on different ways to combine things I already own that I haven't thought to try before? Any help would be super appreciated! 

Below are some examples of the kinds of things I wear on a regular basis...

Shirts: tunics (paired with leggings), longer crop tops (paired with high waisted jeans), button up shirts, men's polo shirts, lots of basic tanks, sometimes men's v neck shirts, most of my tshirts are women's scoop or crew neck, open back shirts (paired with cute bralettes or sports bras so the bra is partially visible)

Jackets: duster cardigans, blazers (I own both masculine and feminine cuts), faux leather jackets, fanvy-ish vests, long-ish denim jacket
