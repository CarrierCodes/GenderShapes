2020-12-01 02:26:57,k4bi5d,8,1,"So I have a fiancé who is a bit apprehensive towards my gender expression because she was burned by her ex who is trans and transitioned during the duration of her relationship with her. I was AMAB, and I’m nonbinary. I present masculine most often (mostly because it just doesn’t cause issues keeping the status quo), but there are times where I decide to present femme. 

We recently moved, my fiancé and I, and I haven’t felt comfortable presenting femme because it’s been such a tumultuous time, and I didn’t want to add any more pressure to the situation. Now that I’ve settled into my job here, I began to feel comfortable to present femme at work, something I’ve never been comfortable doing before. 

One day, the Tuesday before thanksgiving, I asked one of my managers beforehand if it would be okay for me to present femme at work, and she greenlit me. The next day, I came into work dressed femme—complete with shapewear and a wig, but still following company dress code—and I was sent home because one of my other (cis, straight, white) managers (a man) told me that I was distracting. 

I was pretty shaken up about it at the time, went home crying because it’s a really rough time, financially, for the two us. With rent due on the first and already being out of work two days because of the aforementioned holiday, I kinda felt like a major fuck up. Fast forward through to the weekend the executive Vice President of the company called me, told me that I was able to present however I identified in regards to my gender as long as it followed the dress code, and assured me today that I’d be paid for the wages I lost on Wednesday.

I told my fiancé the good news, she hits me with a “we need to talk.” She felt that I was dishonest about not being public about my gender presentation—(I had forgotten that) we had come to an agreement that I wouldn’t present femme in public, and I said that I felt that work, if public, was sort of an isolated public—not attached to my internet profiles or an available presentation at a family gathering. 

She then went on to say, “I just don’t trust that you don’t want to be a woman because this is the same type of stuff my trans ex used to pull and it put me through too much.” (Please bear with her, she’s been through a lot, and I don’t want anyone to attack her, as I love her very much.)

Would someone be able to, with grace, record an explanation to her that I don’t want to be a woman, that I’d simply like to present different than what I was assigned at birth when it comes to gender expression, and that she has no reason to be afraid?

tl;dr:
my very loving fiancé doesn’t believe that I (AMAB) don’t want to be a woman with the fact in mind that I present as femme occasionally.

2020-12-01 04:32:53,k4dor2,3,1,"TLDR: How do you recover after a cishet partner misgenders you? Specifically after sexual contact.

I am NB afab dating a cis man who has only ever been with women in the past. He doesn't actively identify as straight but he doesn't NOT identify with it either, if that makes sense. It caused a lot of anxiety and dysphoria in the beginning of our relationship but after a few discussions and open communication, he understands my perspective and feelings more, and my discomfort has mostly subsided. It doesn't really matter so long as he is able to do/say ""I don't see you as a woman"", and ""I am comfortable telling people we are dating"", which he is.

I KNOW he doesn't see me as a woman. I know he is into me and wants me to feel comfortable and secure in our relationship. If I tell him how to interact with me and my body better, he listens and respects it no ifs ands or buts.

That being said, there have been 2 occasions where he has misgendered me during, or immediately after sex. Given the amount of times we've been sexual, this is a rare occurrence. Nonetheless, it makes me incredibly uncomfortable and dysphoric. I recoil and feel hurt and disgusted, and like I'm not what he wants. He feels guilty, but basically doesn't know how to recover and neither do I. I want to feel safe again but anything he does kind of feels like ""too little too late"". 

I know he didn't mean to hurt me, and I know it's just a momentary lapse in conditioning he's had his entire life up til now, but it DOES hurt, and I can't just ignore it. 
Obviously I am hoping it doesn't happen again, but I want to prepare myself (and him) anyways.

2020-12-01 21:24:17,k4uhbb,7,1,"TW// mentions of s***** abuse, eating disorder 

I’m going to apologize in advance for the long rant I’m about to go on, but I really need to talk about this in a community who is supportive like this. 

My entire life I thought I was a cis-woman. I think most of us assume we are what we are assigned at birth because of hetero-cis normativity. For me, questioning my gender didn’t start until I first questioned my sexuality. I truly didn’t tell myself I was bi until I was 20. After I came out as queer I started to get much more comfortable exploring my identity and trying to be my truest self. I said fuck it to gender and sexuality norms and started going to a barber, literally showing him pictures of men’s haircuts, shopping in the men’s section, using men and women as fashion inspiration and I fell in love with androgyny. I know that androgynous is a huge umbrella term which can mean gender expression (how you physically present/fashion) or gender identity (non-binary/trans/nothing to do with how you outwardly look). For a while I thought that I was just androgynous in a fashion sense, as I love to play up both my masculinity and femininity.  I have never felt more like myself than when I started exploring my androgyny. I think on a deeper level I always knew it was more of my core being. I thought androgyny was just my gender expression as a cis-woman but I now am questioning if I’m actually non-binary/androgne.

Now to back track, I think it’s interesting to look back at my childhood and see how I was always androgynous and didn’t know it. For starters my full name is Elisabeth but I always have preferred the nick name Liz and loath the fact that my full name is hyper feminine. Liz is the only nick name that seems more androgynous, and I chose it when I was 10. I also remember, from a super early age that if I ever have kids I would name them something unisex (like Carter, Dylan, Bailey, etc). I also have always preferred to wear men’s deodorant and cologne, even as a child. For a long time I thought this was because I’m bisexual and as a child I wanted other girls attention, but it’s not just that. 

I also specifically remember wishing I could be a boy when I was a child. I think a big part of that is because of misogyny and me wanting to play football but not being able to as a girl. But maybe there was more to it.

I also grew up having pretty severe eating disorders and body dismorphia. I don’t think I’ve ever had disphoria but now I’m thinking that my body dismorphia could have stemmed from a disphoria with my gender. I used to hate my body and it’s curves and I think I may have hated my curves because they were so feminine? I now love my body after years of eating disorder recovery, and no longer feel this type of uncomfortableness being in my own skin. However when it comes to my genitalia I feel heavily disconnected to it, and always have. I used to think this was due to religious trauma/misogyny and never being told it was okay to explore my body/vagina. (TRIGGER WARNING) I also know for a fact I feel disconnected to my sexual organs because of sexual abuse. For a long time I thought that was the only reason I feel this way but now I’m wondering if it’s also because I MIGHT be non-binary. It’s interesting because as a bisexual person who has a preference for woman, I love the idea of topping a woman. I love the idea of me wearing a strap on. And I’m actually very jealous of people with penis’s. Sometimes I fantasize about having one. I don’t masturbate but I think I would be able to easier if I had a penis. 

With all that being said, I am extremely comfortable in my femininity. I LOVE my femininity and I love being a woman. I am also completely comfortable with she/her pronouns so because of this I’ve always assumed I’m cis. If you can’t tell, I feel extremely confused. I think I am comfortable in my femininity and my womanhood but I also have a masculine side of my gender that I don’t feel like myself without. 

I’m also extremely confused because I have so much misogynistic abuse as a woman, that it has made me hate men. I wish that wasn’t true but it is. I can’t trust them. I feel unsafe with every single man, even my father and brother. So I’m also questioning if I only feel like I don’t want to identity as a cis-woman because of the misogynistic abuse I have endured my entire life BECAUSE I am a woman (obviously non-binary and trans folk deal with even more abuse than the cis population). 

With that being said, the masculinity I feel deep in my soul makes me feel connected to the world. I shouldn’t say I hate men, I don’t. I hate misogyny. And my androgyny actually helps me trust men again, because I have positive masculinity and I am not an abuser. 

I’ve considered myself cis my whole life but it does make me extremely uncomfortable to put down “F” on my driver’s license or when jobs ask what my gender is. But at the same time I like she/her pronouns and I love my womanhood. It is a crucial part of my identity but so I’d being androgynous.

So, my therapist in SF was big about trying to convince me I could have a relationship if I wanted one, and that was cool and all. I even did a little dating in SF, not much, and it didn't really go anywhere. 

Like, I know that my experience with sex and relationships is kinda messed up. I know the majority of people do not have complicated relationships with gender, and I know that most people experience sexual attraction differently. And I know the way I experience attraction kinda fucks things up, so normally I just ignore it, and don't act on it, cause it feels like fraud or something. Like I tricked someone into being friends, then flipped the switch. 

It just doesn't feel like a lot of room exists for me. It was a lot easier to just plan on celibacy, and tell myself that I am too broken for a relationship.

2020-12-02 01:23:52,k4z0pr,12,1,"Hello. I'm hopping over here from r/ftm 

Quickly, I want to say that I suck at the internet and couldn't figure out where the rules for posting here are, so if this isn't the kind of post allowed here, please forgive me!

So, we all know that a certain celebrity has come out as trans non-binary. This is great! Another human being who has fully embraced and accepted their identity.

My question - and I mean this genuinely respectfully and from an angle of wanting to educate/better myself, but will one of you folks please kindly explain how someone can be both non-binary and transgender?

My understanding is obviously bad. I understand how being transgender alone works (seeing as I am trans!), but I must be missing something when it comes to what it means to be a non-binary person. What I think I know is that non-binary can mean you identify with neither male nor female, or identify with both, or don't identify with any kind of gender. So how can someone be a trans man while not identifying as a man or anything?

I really am trying to word this as respectfully as possible. I have zero problems with the way anybody chooses to identify themselves. Whatever feels right to you and makes you happy, that's great! I really am just looking to educate myself and understand better because this news made me realize I'm behind on things. I also wasn't sure what better subreddit to ask this question in.

Nonbinary.
I am not trasgender.
But im not anomalous.
Im not special.
Im still as much of a girl as i was ever.
But just because im passing-
Dosent mean i dont need a transition.
My dysphoria is not just apart of my depressive mental condition.

I want short hair
I'd prefer a flat chest
i want to look good in a cute dress
I want combat boots
And blue lipstick
Im a nonbiary terror
A bisexual mess
I like tough girls
And soft hearted men
If she's taller than me then im in the deep end
I like goth girls
And geeky guys
Dont ask me why
Its just how i fly
Any other day- 
If i saw them then i might just die.

Oh if shes cute and mean you know im falling not far after
But id never be able to come clean
Because she wouldent understand my hang ups and she might be prejudice against my alien mental make up.
I am not a les-bi-an, but im gay and unafraid to say i like a little homoerotic friction.
But if i told he i was a girl and a guy at the same time she'd flip and call me a liar even tho i was forward about being girl all along.
Just because im both dosent mean im lacking in Either
My body dosent represent who i am
But i guess thats uninspired.

If i never said a thing and kept quite it hardly would matter.
But as soon as i open my stupid mouth they're out to disprove and tear my tounge out.
""Ive never seen you as masculine my whole life""
""Youre just a tomboy, don't go overboard this time""
""Its all in your head""
""Its just your mind""
""If your fine with being called a girl, why should i care to mind?""
""Youre not a boy so thats not right""
""Stop being a snowflake you dumb left trite""
""You cant be both, thats not gods plight""
And i shut my mouth! And pretend its alright!

2020-12-02 10:59:05,k5784x,4,1,"Recently i thought a lot about who i am and who i want to be.
I'm 25, afab and my gender expression is pretty feminine most of the time. I'm comfortable with she/her and they/them pronouns, i would rather use neutral pronouns but in my language it's not really possible but i also don't mind female pronouns cause i'm pretty drawn to femininity.

I really feel like i'm not cis. Cause my genitals don't connect to my gender i feel. They are like two different things for me, like i'm convinced what i feel has nothing to do with what my body is like (even if it kind of matches but that would mean that gender and sex are in correlation with each other which is not true... atleast for me) and i think for people who are cis feel a connection between these? 

I think i'm not nonbinary either because what i looked up does not fit me. I've read about neutrois but i don't think i really understand everything. I never really looked into that kind of stuff.
I just know that saying i'm a woman feels so caging to me.
Hearing people say ""Mrs. xyz"" pushes me mentally in this closed spaced but i'm more than that. 

If i could change my body i would keep my features but i wish i had a penis beside my vulva. I feel like that would be my true form. I don't want my vagina, even though i want to have a child someday but periods? Just an unwanted side effect of my body. I heard cis women say that's what gives them a feel of ""being a woman"" and if they stopped bleeding every month they wouldn't feel complete. I don't have this feeling at all. I also heard some trans women would want to have female genitals and/or periods.

I feel the need to define what i feel but i'm not that familiar with different nonbinary terms i just know there are different ones.

2020-12-02 19:41:14,k5gmr8,2,1,"A question for those of you on HRT: do you know if there’s a difference between trans HRT &amp; NB HRT??

I’ve been on estrogen for two months now, and I love the feminizing effects HRT has had on my mind and body. However, I noticed that whenever I’m in public all alone, I now get anxious. Social anxiety is something I never experienced prior to starting HRT, and now that I’m transitioning, I feel like people are looking at me and know I’m trying to become a woman, even though I know that’s not the case!!

These minor anxiety attacks made me realize that I don’t want to fully transition anymore. Being trans is scary as fuck and I feel like the identity comes with a lot of expectations. I don’t want to have to practice my female voice and shave my beard and use the women’s restroom because people perceive me as a woman! I just want to continue being myself but a more feminine version of me. I want to look like a girl but be able to pass as a guy upon second glance. In other words, I’m starting to see myself as less of a trans woman and more of feminine guy/non-binary person.

With said, are any of you on HRT regimens that are specifically for enbies? I’ve read about SERMs, and I want to start taking them to prevent breast growth, so I’ll be seeing my doctor in two weeks. 

If it’s of any relevance, my current HRT regimen is 4mg estradiol and 50mg spironolactone daily. I’m supposed to be taking 200mg spiro but I told my doctor I didn’t feel comfortable taking that high of a dose, because I eventually want to quit spiro and switch to e injections.",NonBinary,Trans HRT vs. NB HRT??,1606963274.0,"{'created_utc': 1606938074, 'id': 'k5gmr8', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'A question for those of you on HRT: do you know if there’s a difference between trans HRT &amp; NB HRT??\n\nI’ve been on estrogen for two months now, and I love the feminizing effects HRT has had on my mind and body.

2020-12-02 23:24:07,k5l44q,1,1,"Posting from my main account so will have to delete this at some point.

I’ve been gender questioning for a while now, actively for a few weeks, but if I’m honest for over a decade internally (30yo). But whenever the topic comes up with flatmates, friends I’ve known for years, it makes me want to never discuss it publicly (never said anything, as far as they know I’m a bi cis man).

I’m going through this particular period where being locked inside for months is making me consider things I hadn’t before and realising I might be non-binary. The idea of calling myself a man feels a bit odd, same for woman. Have been somewhat feminine in aspects of my life for years (makeup, some clothes) but never really considered that it might be an option to just *not* be a man.

And yet tonight in the pub discussions Elliot Page my cis flatmates just didn’t understand why they might want to use he/they pronouns, they just didn’t ‘get it’. And the other day when I mentioned how my ex was genderfluid they laughed because to them genderfluid just sounds like a euphemism for certain fluids. Basically hardly an environment where I feel comfortable discussing my feelings, even though one of those flatmates has been my best friend for 15 years.

Honestly I’m just here to vent more than anything else, not looking for anything in particular. Just wanted to type out how I feel.

But whenever the topic comes up with flatmates, friends I’ve known for years, it makes me want to never discuss it publicly (never said anything, as far as they know I’m a bi cis man).\n\nI’m going through this particular period where being locked inside for months is making me consider things I hadn’t before and realising I might be non-binary. The idea of calling myself a man feels a bit odd, same for woman. Have been somewhat feminine in aspects of my life for years (makeup, some clothes) but never really considered that it might be an option to just *not* be a man.\n\nAnd yet tonight in the pub discussions Elliot Page my cis flatmates just didn’t understand why they might want to use he/they pronouns, they just didn’t ‘get it’. And the other day when I mentioned how my ex was genderfluid they laughed because to them genderfluid just sounds like a euphemism for certain fluids. Basically hardly an environment where I feel comfortable discussing my feelings, even though one of those flatmates has been my best friend for 15 years.\n\nHonestly I’m just here to vent more than anything else, not looking for anything in particular.

I’ve found my sizes, but I can’t afford to buy myself any new stuff because no place would hire me when I applied. They’re just not really looking for teenagers (or, ah hem “*children*” as McDonalds told me) right now. I've tried the McDonalds, 2 different Dunkin's, and Hannaford but those are the only places that hire inexperienced people in my area. I guess I need a college degree to make money.

My Mom refuses to buy me men’s clothes but she can’t stop me from wearing them. All I have is one pair of jeans that’s a little too long, and some sweatpants and hoodies my 12-year-old brother outgrew. As a high school senior, I’d prefer to dress a little more mature, so I can convince people I’m 16 and not 11, even though I’m short.

My Dad’s clothes are all huge on me because he’s a little over a foot taller than I am. He has no money right now either because his job doesn’t pay enough for six people’s food and an old farmhouse with less bedrooms than we really ought to have. 

I’ve made a list on Amazon. There’s nothing more than $25. I was wondering if somebody might be willing to help me buy some of the things I picked out. I might be able to pay shipping costs by redeeming my saved up Swagbucks points, there might be a few dollars, but there’s not much because I don't qualify for most surveys.

I just especially need a shirt or two and a pair of pants and some underwear. I can wash my laundry frequently enough to make them work. 

There are a couple non-clothing items on the list, which I would also really like to get sometime. 

I'd really, really, appreciate it if someone could purchase something from my list and have it mailed to me, or get me a gift card to buy it myself. Or even sending me used clothes similar to the ones I picked. The sizes I wear are already in there, and my address should be too.

I wasn't sure what to flair this as, let me know if I got it wrong.

With quarantine and all that, I’ve had lots of time to think about my identity; just kinda getting to know the ins and outs of my complicated brain. 

At this point though, my mind is racing and so hyper-focused on this one thing that it’s starting to really stress me out. My hair is starting to fall out easier and my stomach gets all tied in knots all the time now. 

For the past few months I’ve been really thinking about the labels; about how society and gender roles still somewhat pertain towards the typical male-or-female-label. How there’s that certainty that you’ll either be put into one box or the other, no hesitation...unless you confuse someone; then you’ll just be labeled a “freak” or be put aside like some outcast. 

I’m AFAB, but these past few years I’ve been low-key wrestling with the truth behind my gender and how I see myself. There’s some things I’m fine with regarding myself, and others I’m not. These past few months have been the worst and weirdest months of (potentially??) chest dysphoria, wishing my voice was deeper, and this odd disappointment of being referred to as “miss” or “ma’am” in public. So that’s physical and social dysphoria right there, sure. I own multiple binders, go by a gender-neutral name among my friends, don’t shave, have very short hair, and mainly wear masculine/“men’s” clothing.

At the same time, I don’t really experience other types of physical dysphoria. I don’t see myself fully aligning with wanting to be a binary man; yeah, there’s some parts to it that seem appealing. A deeper voice, a bit more body hair and a flat chest are all things that I think I want. But do I want to look and be perceived as 100% a binary man?? I don’t think so. Coming out to my family, especially my parents, is also unlikely, regardless of my cis-n’t-ness; they either wouldn’t understand (if I said I was nb) or wouldn’t accept it (if I said I was a binary trans man). I will always be their totally-cis daughter, which I guess I can and will have to tolerate. Coming out will only make my life harder. I’m also so indecisive that I don’t want to come out only to take it back if I realize it was all “fake” or something.

I guess a label would make me feel more at ease, but I also flip-flop between them often, so I haven’t been able to settle on anything more than “non-binary”, and *maybe* transmasc?? I still feel like I’m faking it. I have trans friends that I’ve rather admired in their coming-to-terms with who they are, so maybe I’m just becoming influenced by them to feel special?? What if I’m just a masc butch woman?? Or maybe I’m binary trans?? I don’t know. It keeps me up at night. I almost want to will it away so that I can just be a totally 100% cis person with no doubts about any of it. 

I’m not sure if I’d like advice?? Or just a place to vent my frustrations?? I don’t know what to do. Maybe I should just accept things as they are and leave it alone for the sake of my mind not crumbling under all the constant obsession.

2020-12-04 04:06:22,k6di0x,2,1,"I recently left a relationship. It’s cool. But there was something itching me in the inside. It was this last couple years where I realized I liked both gay men *and* NB people. Gender identity and sexuality are very very different and yet despite that I think I’ve been dishonest and uncertain with myself.

I feel so weird right now coming here and taking about this when I’m so uneducated and ignorant about other NB people and there’s this feeling going on in my head after this break up. Let me explain.

I have been presenting as masculine, maybe even to a degree, “manly”, because it was socially more valuable in dating, it’s easiest for others who already see me this way. I’ve become to accustomed to it. I feel like a hypocrite, how can I speak out on toxic masculinity between an interaction of two gay men and yet not be honest with myself — whatever it is that I am. I’m still uncertain. I’ve been a “gay man” because it’s been easier to explain that and be accepted as that. I’m aware that my 6’3 tall ass with hairy arms is what some other gay men see as masculine. More and more I realize that after letting go of the fear of not being attractive to people, or being alone, that I don’t want that. 

I’ve literally been doing this creative project to get my mind of things where it’s a fictional world with fictional races.  One race doesn’t have gender and now I’m wondering if this has been me trying to explore this topic and I just been to dumb to see it. 

I prefer they/them. I know that for a fact. I know that I don’t like people associating me with feminine or masculine behavior, but I don’t want to drastically change my appearance. Don’t get me wrong, god I have so many insecurities about how I look, - I guess no, I don’t know how I want to look but even if I could, I’m in this body. I realize I don’t want to worry about how my body looks to other people in that way - I kind of just wish no one saw me as anything but an internet avatar sometimes. 

I changed my name legally about 6 years ago. I changed it to a gender neutral name but at the time I believed I was just separating myself from my old biblical name that wasn’t me. It was the biblical nature of it not the gender that I was touting as the issue. Maybe not. 

If I’ve been NB this entire time I feel like an ass for only being concerned and defensive of others (non cis) people because I might identify as one, not for an altruistic reason. IDK if that makes sense.

Somehow I’m 27, freshly broken up and I don’t know who I am or have been, and I feel guilty and dumb. Dumb to have gone with what was easiest to get me accepted or affirmation.

I have made plenty of bad choices I have blamed on self esteem. Maybe it’s time I start taking care of it and my well being.

It’s cool. But there was something itching me in the inside. It was this last couple years where I realized I liked both gay men *and* NB people. Gender identity and sexuality are very very different and yet despite that I think I’ve been dishonest and uncertain with myself.\n\nI feel so weird right now coming here and taking about this when I’m so uneducated and ignorant about other NB people and there’s this feeling going on in my head after this break up. Let me explain.\n\nI have been presenting as masculine, maybe even to a degree, “manly”, because it was socially more valuable in dating, it’s easiest for others who already see me this way. I’ve become to accustomed to it. I feel like a hypocrite, how can I speak out on toxic masculinity between an interaction of two gay men and yet not be honest with myself — whatever it is that I am. I’m still uncertain. I’ve been a “gay man” because it’s been easier to explain that and be accepted as that. I’m aware that my 6’3 tall ass with hairy arms is what some other gay men see as masculine. More and more I realize that after letting go of the fear of not being attractive to people, or being alone, that I don’t want that. \n\nI’ve literally been doing this creative project to get my mind of things where it’s a fictional world with fictional races.  One race doesn’t have gender and now I’m wondering if this has been me trying to explore this topic and I just been to dumb to see it. \n\nI prefer they/them. I know that for a fact. I know that I don’t like people associating me with feminine or masculine behavior, but I don’t want to drastically change my appearance. Don’t get me wrong, god I have so many insecurities about how I look, - I guess no, I don’t know how I want to look but even if I could, I’m in this body. I realize I don’t want to worry about how my body looks to other people in that way - I kind of just wish no one saw me as anything but an internet avatar sometimes. \n\nI changed my name legally about 6 years ago. I changed it to a gender neutral name but at the time I believed I was just separating myself from my old biblical name that wasn’t me. It was the biblical nature of it not the gender that I was touting as the issue. Maybe not. \n\nIf I’ve been NB this entire time I feel like an ass for only being concerned and defensive of others (non cis) people because I might identify as one, not for an altruistic reason. IDK if that makes sense.\n\nSomehow I’m 27, freshly broken up and I don’t know who I am or have been, and I feel guilty and dumb. Dumb to have gone with what was easiest to get me accepted or affirmation.\n\nI have made plenty of bad choices I have blamed on self esteem. Maybe it’s time I start taking care of it and my well being.\n\nI told friends today that I don’t know if I’m NB or anything but I’m questioning and I’m not “rushing” anything - can you rush your gender?

hello r/non-binary! i am 18 and questioning and i want your thoughts. I certainly look like a female. I like make up and wearing cute bikinis to the beach. I also like baseball and baggy jackets and motorcycles. Not that any of those things have a gender. Not really. 

I went to catholic high school so i dont know things. Even though most of my friends are AMAB only a few were NB and they were all much younger than me. It seemed kind of silly to me almost. Like when I'm 40 and look back this will be some weird phase in my life. I worry a lot. At first i felt that way about my sexuality too. I'm queer (sorry if you don't use that word, i just think it fits me the best) and i really don't care who i date's gender in the slightest. The thing is my parents are 'ok with the gays.' They don't think gay marriage should be allowed but other than that they don't really care. They are transphobic though. My father once told me that being trans is a mental illness and that it's a parents right to send their child to conversion therapy. It's their right. their right. that scars me. 

i don't mind she/her pronouns. i mean ive been using them my whole life. But i'm starting to wonder if they is a better word. Can 'they' wear lace mesh tops and skirts and high heels? can 'they' wear jewelry and not be androgynous some days but be very androgynous on others? do you have any good questioning resources? is it ok that i don't mind she/her pronouns but would prefer others? am i out of my mind?",NonBinary,A question?,1607131243.0,"{'created_utc': 1607106043, 'id': 'k6qdty', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""tw transphobia\n\nhello r/non-binary! i am 18 and questioning and i want your thoughts.

I'm hoping to get top surgery in the next year or 2 as my first (&amp; maybe last) step of medically transitioning but I am curious about potentially starting T if I still feel idk....too gender-y after top.

Hey friends

Cis? lesbo here with a question if anyone can help. Asked my therapist first but she had ""never heard of that before! wow!"" so here I am. I am wondering if anyone has any insight into distinguishing body dysmorphia (symptom of anorexia) + gender dysphoria. I'll explain.

I am female + grew up with an eating disorder (anorexia/extreme exercise) + have been treated. Was doing beautifully until I realized I was a lesbian (thought I was bi up to then) subsequently dropped LOTS of weight, enter old habits, etc. Enter confusion: seems entirely connected to gender expression? E.g., hyperfixation on my jawline, arm/shoulder definition, abs/lower stomach? Whereas growing up it was the opposite: thigh gap, collar bones, dainty wrists, you get the picture. Enter extreme confusion: can no longer wear bras... only comfortable in particularly tight sports bras. Dieting/exercising with a subconscious goal of reducing breast/bum size. I know dysphoria is a heavy word. I don't know what is going on. Anyone have any insight? Many thanks in advance my loves.

2020-12-05 15:43:39,k79mh8,1,1,"Hello :)

I am just writing to complain and search for people who experience the same. Maybe somebody has some good coping strategies.

As a child I was a huge tomboy/ basically looked and lived as a boy. I was always mis(?)gendered as a boy and kind of enjoyed it.

In puberty I changed to be a super slutty girl (no shame on that, I continue to be an ethical slut) and wanted to have the attention from all the guys. It made me feel like a valid female. But I never felt like myself and I always felt manly in a negative way. I am tall, have wide shoulders, I am very strong, have a deep voice and I am in general a loud person. People made fun of me for that and questioned my femininity.

1 year ago I slowly started to change again to be more masculine presenting. I don't feel like I want to be a men.. but neither I feel like I am a women. I have masculine and feminine sides and I love to express them both. I don't like my typical feminine name and wish to use a unisex one, but I would feel stupid to introduce myself like that. I neither feel part of the girls group, nor of the guys group. I wish guys would treat me like a guy and girls like a girl. (Idk if that's understandable but I feel like I am on neutral ground).

I sometime feel like I might not be attractive because I don't meet the beauty standards for women. I just got rejected by my gynophile crush and feel like it might have something to that I am male presenting and told him that I don't feel like I am ""a true woman"".  

At least I see myself in the mirror and think I am hot. But when I am around other girls I get insecure and feel like a joke. 

I am thinking of going to a LGBTQIA+ bar to maybe find a safe space and community. Did it help for you?

2020-12-05 19:04:11,k7dgfu,2,1,"Hi so this is gonna be a lot of questions and I'm okay with not having all the answers. For a long time I've had a lot of feelings and emotions and spiritual disconnects with myself. It wasn't until the beginning of this year and again when I moved out that I began to accept myself for who I was more. The reason for all of the disconnect and frustration on my part imo was most likely due to my mormon upbringing. 

I grew up mormon in california which is a godsend tbh I am so glad I didn't grow up in Utah. I love southern Utah so much for the scenery but I figure that's probably where the end of that adoration lies. Growing up my parents were really toxic to another and while they were good about keeping it away from us as kids, I came to learn that I was hated in a way by my mother (she drew negative associations to me  and connected them to her life issues at the time I was born). For my entire childhood and teenage years I had a lot of expectations, ideologies, and identities placed upon me. Anytime I confessed having an issue with masturbation my parents looked at me with disgust and told me to go to bed and ""pray it away"". I was groomed to be a missionary and a good man to marry some woman in the temple one day. To go to college at some church university and just be who they wanted to be. And for a long time, I was. 

Fast forward to 2018, my junior year of high school. I rented a cabin with some of my bestest friends and now roommates. On the trip, my friend Gabe and I talked religion and ideology and suddenly my first emotional and mental frustration began. I couldn't be the apologist for the religion that my dad was anymore especially as I began seriously looking into it's founding, the people within it, and more. I couldn't believe in a God who didn't want their children to love themselves and be who they wanted to be. I began to stop going to church after that life changing trip and began working on a plan to move out with the guys in the fall of 2020. 

In between 2018 and 2020, I found out that I was bisexual (or so I thought at the time) and started to steadily understand a lot more about my heart and my mind and who I really wanted to be. While renting an Airbnb with the guys again in June of 2020, I made the decision to nair my body hair and when I got out of the shower and looked in the mirror I felt more comfortable and more myself than I ever had. When I got home I told my parents I lost a bet. 

Before my roommates (the guys) and I moved out in September, I bought some cute clothes to ""crossdress"" in and again I felt even more myself than ever before. My heart broke when I realized I couldn't leave my bathroom dressed that way, so I put back on my masc clothes and went back to my room. When I was finally moved out I felt so free and happy, and began to dress that way whenever I could 🌟

Between then and now I began daily meditation and I started a path of self discovery. After meeting a nonbinary person going through transition out where the roomies and I moved to, I suddenly began to realize feelings I had buried inside of myself. Suddenly my name felt less and less my own and looking at myself in the mirror in my masculine clothes and even without them I felt off. After a lot of research, meditation, and help from friends, I finally figured that I must have been nonbinary and pansexual my whole life, but my feelings of responsibility and duty to my parents to be a ""good normal son"" (since my older sisters are both in the lgbtq+ community and also distanced from the church) had always blocked my true self from coming out. I feel so much happier and more me every day and I'm planning to see my doctor about hormone therapy in the next couple of months. Money is tight atm as it is for many, but I'm excited to keep developing and caring for Cecil, the person I always knew I was but only could remember them in dreams. I used to dream about this beautiful person over the last couple years and I thought it was who I would marry but as I dressed up for the first time I saw them in the reflection. I'm crying right now and I cried then thinking about it. 

I've come out to my close friends and my siblings who were all super loving and accepting. My parents are the last ones really who I haven't told. They have changed and grown and matured so much over the last ten years and our relationship is really good, but I'm not sure they will accept me. I hop they can honor and accept me as I have honored and accepted them for who they are and how that and their life experiences developed their ideologies, but I'm not sure it will be a two way street. My dad still refers to my enby nibbling (my sister's step kid) as their dead name and dead pronouns without fail so that worries me.

I figured however it happens, it'll be better to get it done. I'll always love my parents for raising me the best they could and becoming better people and more human; I just hope I don't have to leave them behind in my life's journey. Maybe they'll change and meet me where I'm at in my life and respect my decision. Maybe they'll turn me away.

For a long time I\'ve had a lot of feelings and emotions and spiritual disconnects with myself. It wasn\'t until the beginning of this year and again when I moved out that I began to accept myself for who I was more. The reason for all of the disconnect and frustration on my part imo was most likely due to my mormon upbringing. \n\nI grew up mormon in california which is a godsend tbh I am so glad I didn\'t grow up in Utah. I love southern Utah so much for the scenery but I figure that\'s probably where the end of that adoration lies. Growing up my parents were really toxic to another and while they were good about keeping it away from us as kids, I came to learn that I was hated in a way by my mother (she drew negative associations to me  and connected them to her life issues at the time I was born). For my entire childhood and teenage years I had a lot of expectations, ideologies, and identities placed upon me. Anytime I confessed having an issue with masturbation my parents looked at me with disgust and told me to go to bed and ""pray it away"". I was groomed to be a missionary and a good man to marry some woman in the temple one day. To go to college at some church university and just be who they wanted to be. And for a long time, I was. \n\nFast forward to 2018, my junior year of high school. I rented a cabin with some of my bestest friends and now roommates. On the trip, my friend Gabe and I talked religion and ideology and suddenly my first emotional and mental frustration began. I couldn\'t be the apologist for the religion that my dad was anymore especially as I began seriously looking into it\'s founding, the people within it, and more. I couldn\'t believe in a God who didn\'t want their children to love themselves and be who they wanted to be.

2020-12-05 22:40:05,k7hegi,12,1,"I'm accepting of people who are trans, nonbinary, homosexual, bisexual, etc but TBH I don't really want to call people xe/xer or kitty/kittyself (please let me know if that is supposed to be a joke or something and I'm just not getting it). If someone wants to be referred to as they/them, it/itself, any word that is in real English I'd be happy to refer to them as that, but I don't understand why some people don't like being called they/them.

I've seen people argue that they/them is plural and its too abstract, however, IMO everyone should be okay with being called they/them regardless if theyre cis or not. When you're hearing someone tell you a story like ""ugh I had to deal with this really annoying person the other day"" and you respond with ""oh I'm so sorry you had to deal with them"" you're not referring to multiple people, you're referring to the specific individual the person is telling you about without using gender-specific pronouns. I don't see why xe/xer are pronouns, they're not actual words in a dictionary and kitty/kittyself is just weird to me because I don't want to refer to someone as another species/animal.

This was when I was in high school and participated in the musical. This was also before I came out nonbinary. On the nights of the performance, I was given a basic makeup kit and I was tasked to apply it, including lipstick. At first it seemed very foreign and felt uncomfortable, especially the lipstick. But in the end I enjoyed trying something new. 

Fast forward to now and I came out a few months ago. I have a TON of masculine features and it isn't too obvious that Im nonbinary. It also doesn't help that Im wearing a face mask when in public. I get misgendered very often by customers, but honestly I cannot blame them. The only indication that Im nonbinary are my pride bracelets (one for ace and the other nonbinary). Im very friendly and open to talk about my gender identity to customers whenever misgendered, but it always bothers me that people can't tell im nonbinary.

Now when it comes to makeup, I do not plan on making myslef too feminine. The idea of wearing a dress and dressing feminine makes me uncomfortable. And I can't imagine how people would react if I did it. I am a college student and live with a very anti LGBTQ family. My parents said many harsh things to me in arguments revolving my gender identity. What I want from putting on makeup is to look like how I did on stage. If anybody participated in school musicals you may have an idea of what Im talking about. I want the makeup to be basic and also hide my acne.

Hello everybody!
My name is Grace, my pronouns are they/them, and I am the co-founder of an activism project called the Hear the Queers Campaign. We are going to be focusing on creating a more inclusive and safe environment for LGBTQ+ youth in schools, and including more information about LGBTQ - related topics in classes like history, science, and health class. We are just beginning, and would like to gather some data to see if there is anything else we should be paying attention to. 

Attached below is a survey made by HQC, and it will ask you about the discrimination you may have faced due to your gender and/or sexuality. All responses are submitted anonymously, so we cannot know the name, address, or anything else about you except what country/state you live in. All of the questions are completely optional, so you do not have to answer any of the questions if you may not feel comfortable doing so. Even if you are cisgender and heterosexual, it would still be great to hear your experience.

My gender has been a complicated subject consciously and continuously through my life since I was in 2nd or 3rd grade. I insisted on going to school for halloween in my sisters school uniform w/ a wig on. I remember vividly walking up the stairs internally wanting to be seen as someone who was not me and was disappointed (moderately) when friends recognized me. To be honest I give myself and my parents a big round of applause, me for being brave and expressive and my parents for letting me do my thing. Years passed and I'd dress up sometimes in secret, occasionally question what it meant and gravitate towards feminine things. These thoughts/feelings persisted into puberty and past puberty but I shoved them down a bit and only thought of them as non-conforming expression (something I felt embarrassed of but didn't want to be, that's the way I was). Being gay felt right, easier to acknowledge and less severe. Any further thoughts were shoved down

I finally came out my sophomore year of HS as gay. I finally felt free and free to express myself as femme as there seems to be more allowance / permission or even expectation for gay men to do such. I didn't begin to get confused again until arriving at college. I was surrounded by more queer people than ever before of all different identities. It wasn't until my sophomore year of college after doing psychedelics with my roommates that I was finally able to admit gender fluidity / an aspect of trans experience to my identity. I actually proclaimed I was a trans-woman. The day after the thought didn't feel quite as clear to me. I spent many months after talking to friends, therapist, family, obsessively thinking about such (I do have OCD) and researching forums, others experiences, trans / non-binary you tubers, etc. I came to zero concrete conclusion. This bugged me majorly and sent me into more of a depressive stage. Over time though I began to embrace the uncertainty and allowed myself to dress act, and be as unapologetically myself as I could be.

The following summer I began to experiment further. Growing out my hair, asking friends to use he/they/she pronouns via perception / my expression, wearing more makeup, dressing more femme, etc. I continued to research, journal, talk to all aforementioned and try and explore how I felt day by day. Eventually I was only being referred to by those who didn't know me in public by she/her pronouns, Miss, Ma'am, Ladies when in a group, I got cat called, was hit on, etc. Overtime I realized I was passing as a ""woman."" It was nice but not euphoric / there was no ""this is it!"" moment. To be honest overtime I became distressed over not being able to present more masc/ androgynous. I decided to cut my hair and for the experiment to be over. Cutting my hair gave me euphoria and presenting in boy mode again felt wonderful. I finally felt sexier then I'd ever felt. But part of me missed the more feminine me. The long hair, the way I was starting to act, etc. It's been almost two years now and I feel like just as many question have been raised the only difference is I'm more comfortable with myself.

The problem is I don't feel like cis, non-binary or binary trans fit me at all. All I know is I'm depressed and feel like I don't know myself. I oscillate frequently. Sometimes I tell myself that I've just rejected being a feminine man so much so I've convinced myself I'm non-binary (as I'm adamant to those around me that my gay-male title is important to me just as much as also being acknowledged as something more than that). I've prayed to be comfortable in a singular non-binary identity and I've longed to feel such a strong feminine allegiance that I can just transition to being a trans-woman. But the idea scares me. I like the way I look now, I like being gay I don't think I want to give it up forever. But part of me wonders if I'd be happier living as a woman. The problem is nobody can answer that for me and I can't for myself and I'm scared to dive into something that I may regret and only doing social transition didn't feel like enough. I feel incredibly stuck. The best way I describe the way I feel is ""femme-male."" I feel like a femme gay male and a woman either simultaneously, separately or something ambiguous at other times.

I'm out to my partner, friends, and by accident a work colleague, but I feel like the beginning of a new decade is a good time to come out to my parents.

I was strongly thinking about it when they visited over summer (during a lockdown lift) but never quite found the moment to bring it up.

My parents know + are supportive of my bisexuality &amp; previous polyamorous relationships, and they pro-trans as far as I can tell (at least, binary trans - Jack Monroe is the only GQ/NB person in our shared knowledge and they use ""she"" to refer to Jack... who does use she/them afaik, but I'm always hyperanalysing conversation to find support/negativity)

What I'm struggling with the most is bringing it up. Any tips on that?

Also, I guess, explaining the whole thing? I know I'm going to have to explain, particularly to my mum (my dad's come across the concept somewhat before).

Finally - for those who are out at GQ/NB to family members, what did you ask them to do/change? E.g. refer to you with new pronouns, sibling instead of sister, child instead of son.

Since doing so however, I guess I find myself feeling a bit weird about being feminine?(more so than normal)

I'm  AFAB, it's not like there at tons of feminine things I do, but since coming out, and really loving shining light on my nonfemale self, I guess I'm being hyper critical of myself and if I'm presenting feminine or not?

Before coming out as NB I guess I didn't think twice about acting feminine, but at the same time I wanted my masculine traits to be more prominent.

Now idk, I feel like I'm internally gatekeeping myself?

I know nonbinary is liberating, and there isn't a wrong way to go about it, but are these feelings normal? Will I get more into the swing of things with time?

Also I'm conflicted on pronouns, to some extent I want to keep using she/her, but it is somewhat incorrect. They/them is just new and a bit abstract for my brain atm.

i don’t mind if people think i’m a guy out in public, but i also don’t care if they think i’m a girl, or if they just have no clue lol.

I'll use ""man"" and ""woman"" to describe the social norm of what is perceived male and female and he/she pronouns for simplicity since I'm not talking about any specific person in my explanation. 
Also English isn't my first language so apologies in advance for any mistakes. 

I find it difficult to put my thoughts into words so let's hope this makes sense to anyone else. 

So I(22) am AMAB. I don't know if I'd say I'm in the wrong body but I wish I had the body of a female? 
Like I am bi and so I'm attracted to most people however they identify and I can look at a man and think ""wow he's attractive, good for him."" But I don't have any memory of then ever thinking ""I wish I looked like him."" 

However;

I can look at a woman and think ""wow she's so beautiful, I wish I looked like her."" And wish I had all her female physical attributes?
I'd like to try makeup. Dress in clothes that are designed for women (But I also have nothing against clothes designed for men).I Wish I had the female form. I almost exclusively hang out with women and most often feel I have nothing in common with men socially. 

Here's the ""but"":
 
What I've read about gender dysphoria it sounds very traumatic and I wouldn't say I have it. I've not had my mental health effected over the fact that I have a masculine body even though I wish I had the body of a female. And I'm fine with the name I was given.

Luckily I'm pretty sure I managed to convince her that it was in fact just a misclick.

She constantly goes on about how I'm a girl. Like talking about how I'm a ""girl coder"" while signing up to a course and ""the only girl drummer in the school"" after looking at a drum lesson timetable. I wish I could tell her how awkward it makes me feel but I'd just get yelled at.

There was this other time when we were sitting around the dinner table and I offhandedly mentioned how JK Rowling was a transphobe.

Earlier today I was talking to my mum and she mentioned how she needs to get around to getting my national insurance number fixed (I'm afab but for some reason it states my gender as male).

*Adding a NSFW flair just in case.*  
I've been feeling quite dysphoric lately, and at first I thought I might be transgender (it's been going on ad off for a while but it has been stronger more recently), but I've realised I'm just kinda switching between feeling feminime and very in-between.

And I now also realise that the dysphoria seems to stem from my lack of a penis.

I feel like there should be one there, but like the rest of my genitals should also be there.

I basically feel like I should have both genitals and I literally have no clue how I'm supposed to deal with this, it's tearing me apart and I know that there is no possible way to actually do this.

2020-12-07 01:56:30,k875hs,0,1,"Hello all :D Here are some tips and tricks i have learned in order to dress in a way that better fits your desired gender expression

I have heard that ""dressing weird"" confuses people (idk but this is really funny to me). So like mixing ""feminine"" (floral, poka dots, etc.) and ""masculine"" (stripes, checks, and geometic design) patterns. Perhaps going with oversized clothing, like a large sweater. You could also add cool eccentric accessories (like a red lip, a cool hat, or costume jewelry).

Just make sure to stay either monotone or stick to a color theme (or dont! sometimes it looks better without!). 

Some ways to change your physical appearance, or draw attention to where you want it. For example: when wearing hats, wearing it far back on the head (facing upwards) is feminine (frames the face), while  near the brow is more masculine (draws attention downwards on the face). For shirts, untucked is the way to go to soften the silhouette, while tucked into pants/skirts makes the silhouette sharper. Small glasses draws attention to facial features while larger glasses can soften them. 

Keep in mind that your gender and fashion expression has nothing to do with your gender identity, this is just ways that styles are sometimes perceived. You don't have to look androgynous to be non-binary, just do and wear what makes you comfortable and happy!!!

I'm 19F, I've been dating my boyfriend for \~6 weeks. He's pansexual and I'm asexual.

2020-12-07 06:28:49,k8bckx,4,1,"I am going to try and keep this as short as POSSIBLE, because I typed out all this stuff once and it ended up being like two pages long. Basically, my friends have come out genderqueer (she/her) and nonbinary (they/them) both within the month and it's thrown me into my own identity crisis, but I can't tell if I'm just being impulsive and trying to jump on the bandwagon or if it's actually legitimate. I have always had a deeply rooted fear of being some kind of imposter (this fear that made me deny my symptoms of adhd for uhh my whole life!) so I need someone else to tell me whether I'm just being coocoo and need to get my head out of the clouds, or if my experience is similar to anyone else's.

When I started going through puberty, it was uncomfortable and weird as it is for anyone, and I basically outright rejected femininity due to internalized misogyny. But even when I became more comfortable with femininity much later in life, I still identified with the part of myself that enjoyed dressing more masc. I know obviously that the clothes you wear do NOT correlate to your gender identity! That's part of why I feel like I'm exaggerating, because even in highschool I wondered if I was trans because I liked men's clothes but I was like ""no that's stupid lol"" and I moved on from it. I have never liked people misgendering me as a man, but the only times that has ever happened was with children and people intentionally calling me a ""little boy"" because of my hair and kinda bullying me lol.  I got my hair cut short in my junior year of highschool, and I tried growing it back out but I just couldn't. I felt like I was looking at someone different in the mirror. I tried to explain this to my dad but he didn't get it. I have always admired androgynous people/fashion and have always had that longing ""I wish that were me"" feeling. In terms of my body, I am generally comfortable with it, I like my breasts and I think I'm more confident now because of my boyfriend, but there are times where I just hate them, I don't want them visible, I wish I had a binder or something. And sometimes I look in the mirror and they just feel like big, weird fruit and I can't stand them being visible. Specifically, I sometimes have really weird.. dissociative moments? For lack of a better word? It's usually when I'm naked and getting dressed where I have this sudden ""this is wrong, I don't like this, my body is weird"" feeling and it's very tense and I feel like, uncomfortable in an adult body, as I've described to my boyfriend. But now maybe I'm wondering if I just feel uncomfortable in a body that's developed breasts? I just have a sudden, unnatural feeling and it feels like I'm just mourning my prepubescent body. Sometimes I do enjoy presenting male, or at least as a masculine woman. Like, for one halloween years ago, I dressed as Ezio from assassin's creed and I felt so cool, not necessarily because he's a cool character, but because it felt nice to connect to my more masculine side.

This all came to a head for me when my best friend had bleached my hair, and I got my bra wet rinsing it off so I wore her very oversized hoodie without my bra and we went to eat n park. The waitress addressed us as ladies and got our drinks, and when she came back she asked us if she had used the right pronouns. Never in my life before have I had anyone even ask my pronouns. It's always been assumed that I am female because frankly I'm a 32G and my chest is hard to hide, and I've only ever been misgendered by children who don't understand that women can have short hair. I've never had someone not immediately assume, though. And I didn't mind it. I didn't mind being perceived as somewhere in-between, or unidentifiable.

What I want to know is, am I going crazy? Is this post just gonna be a laugh for everyone, like ""haha look at this cis girl, she just likes dressing androgynous and she's freaking out"" or like, is my experience even remotely similar to any of you? I don't know... I probably am cis and just need someone to tell me off. I didn't want to bring it up to my friends because I don't want them to think I just want to be included, but maybe it's worse to be posting here. Sorry this post is so long btw, this was literally as compact I could make it.

I didn\'t want to bring it up to my friends because I don\'t want them to think I just want to be included, but maybe it\'s worse to be posting here. Sorry this post is so long btw, this was literally as compact I could make it.\n\nTLDR; my friends came out under the NB umbrella and it\'s making me question my life experiences and whether I fall somewhere under this umbrella, I\'ve always wanted to be somewhat androgynous and idk what it means lol', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': ""How do you know if you're nonbinary?

I'm a 19 y/o amab enby from Canada who is going on to play football in university next year, for those of you who are questioning their gender while scared of losing a sport they play read my story. 

HI, I'm 19, almost 20, I'm from Canada, I have been playing football since grade 10. Around that same time I started questioning my gender, I was never really one to be overly ""masculine"" and I wanted to do some research into genders. Finding out about gender dysphoria and what it was, I realized that I was experiencing it too, I was just coming out of puberty and, where I used to be tall and skinny with barely any body hair and used to look incredibly androgynous (which I enjoyed because it didn't bring to much attention to me), I started to film out, I started getting very muscular, my chest started getting bigger as in like my bone structure changed, I started growing hair everywhere and I found myself wanting to go back to my old self, wanting to be androgynous, not wanting all these changes.

I fell in love with the game of football while slowly realizing that I wasn't male, slowly realizing that the game I was starting to love could be taken away from me so I was scared to figure out my identity, and coming on reddit didn't help much either because there wasn't any sort of representation for amabs with my size and body type (I am now 6'4, ~250lbs) that I could see so I became very depressed and unsure about myself.

A therapist that I had asked me where I got the thought that I could lose football and it got me thinking, WHY did I think that I would lose it if I came out? I think it was  because of the stereotypical sexism, homophibia and transphobia from both the fans and the athletes in the sport itself. The only problem is, looking back at it now, I had never experienced that, we had 3 girls playing on the little league team that I helped coach in the summer, there was a girl that played on the Jr Varsity club team I played with in the summer, hell there were girls playing on different high school teams around the city, why did I think coming out as non binary would be any different.

So I embraced it, I came out to family and close friends who I knew would be supportive and then just didn't keep it a secret, I didn't necessarily come out to everyone but at the same time if someone asked I didn't deny it. And you wanna know what? Nothing changed, I was still the football player at school, I could still play the sport I loved, and I didn't lose any friends over it and that's even from being at a country school.

I'm now completing a semester of college to get my grades up and then going on to university where I will be playing football and earning a degree in social work.

I'm a 4th year game design student, and I'm working on a dissertation pertaining to non-binary inclusion in role-playing games. If you're a non-binary gamer who plays RPGs, I'd really appreciate it if you could answer my survey! All respondents will remain anonymous, and all questions are optional.

The survey seeks to gather the thoughts and opinions of non-binary players of RPGs in regards to their experiences in the genre. Data collected will be used to establish the current state of non-binary inclusion in RPGs, and draw attention to what non-binary players would like to see in RPGs going forward.

I'm also hoping to conduct some short online interviews, so if you're interested in participating in that, you can leave a contact email at the end of the survey, or DM me here on Reddit! Any contact information provided will be deleted once the interview process is complete.

&amp;#x200B;

Before taking part, please ensure that you fulfill the following criteria;

* You are at least 18 years of age
* You identify as non-binary
* You are a player of RPGs

If you have any questions, feel free to DM me!

I'm AMAB and up until earlier this year/last year I was comfortable with he/him pronouns exclusively but I've been thinking about my identity recently.

 I've been inspired to expand my wardrobe recently to include more effeminate clothing and am really happy wearing more clothes that are perceived as feminine (cardigans, pastel colours, etc) or undgendered (oversized clothes, cargo trousers etc). I've always been a strong believer that anyone can wear what they want, so coming to terms with this has been easy for me and I was still happily identifying as male.

More recently, I started wearing nail polish and this I suppose has become the catalyst where I started questioning my identity. I don't feel wholly uncomfortable identifying as male, but I don't feel it fully represents me anymore and when I think of people referring to me as he/him/male, I don't feel like that's fully me anymore. I have a lot to learn about myself still, but I love the idea of being unbound from gender and it makes me happy and comfortable to feel like I'm me, instead of trying to persuade myself I still fit the cis male pigeonhole as I identified previously.

Sorry for the long intro, I had a lot to get off my chest, but here's my question - I'm happy wearing male passing clothes with the odd feminine outfit but can I still be non-binary if my style still leans towards what is percieved as male? Does it even matter?

Plus my mother had religious intent behind it and I'm forever uncomfortable with that. 

So I chose the surname ""Flowers"" a long time ago and have always loved it. Especially because of Tommy Flowers and Brandon Flowers. But I struggled finding a first name because I wanted it to be rare, unique, and have no religious origin. I also felt kind of uncomfortable choosing a name from a culture I was not a part of.

I started transitioning to male when I was about 17. I’ve been on T for 3.5 years. Prior to transitioning, I was quite feminine, but something about me never felt right— I was severely depressed and I always felt very disconnected from my body. After about 2 years on T, my dysphoria practically disappeared and I felt very comfortable with my body. I still felt a bit of shame for being trans, but it was manageable. 

Now, after 3.5 years, I feel confused again. It’s as though I have dysphoria in the opposite direction. I love the changes I’ve had on T (deeper voice, more muscle, perceived as male) but I sometimes wonder what my life would have been like if I never transitioned. Sometimes I do wish I could just spend a day being a woman to know how it would feel, but whenever I wear feminine clothing or put on makeup, I feel horrible about myself. But then... I imagine myself as a woman and I feel comfortable. It’s like no matter which way I identify (man or woman) I feel intense dysphoria.

My 18th birthday just passed, and my grandma has this tradition where on each kid's 18th birthday, they get a special handmade quilt. It's always personlized. She usually follows stereotypical gender roles making them - girls get reds, blues, and purples while boys get blues, greens, and yellows.

As the youngest of all her grandkids, I was fully expecting to not even get one. I had accepted it years ago and all but forgotten about it. Then we get a box in the mail. It's my quilt, and it's both pink and blue. The pink is covered in swirly, flowery patterns, with bits of blue scattered throughout, so that the blue borders don't feel out of place. It's adorable. I love it. I can feel the thought she put into making it for me. I called and said thank you right after I got it. I've been sleeping under it ever since. It's warmer than any of my other blankets. 

I'm really really lucky that my dad's side of the family has been so supportive. My mom's side is... complicated. There's so much family drama over there that I'm pretty sure my gender is the last of their worries, but they still manage to make snarky comments, so I guess they're gracious enough to leave room in their schedule. /s

Now, I know this must be a hard thing to find, but they are looking for a book with an NB main character whom them can relate with (so no crazy science fiction, aliens and stuff), but that isn't necessary about coming out. Just like any novel, but through the perspective of an NB person.

Additionally, it would be great if said character is flawed in a deeply human. Apparently she found some books, but the character was so idealized that it was impossible for them to actually relate.

- an NB main character
- preferably not about going out
- not crazy science fictions, but actually relatable

So, I wrote a piece for my school's principal on why we should have a unisex/gender neutral bathroom. I thought I might share it with you wonderful people to see what you think. Hopefully it works and we get our bathroom.

60% of transgender or gender non-conforming individuals avoid public bathrooms. There are many reasons for this, ranging from gender dysphoria (the feeling of unease about your gender/body) to general uncomfortability or potential harassment (which I hope our school is better than). I am one of these people, I have friends that do this and I know that there are others in our school that do this. Schools are beginning to implement unisex bathrooms for transgender or gender non-conforming individuals, and we should be one of them. We need to be one of them.

First of all, it makes these students more comfortable and feel better about themselves. Being forced to choose between two things you don’t fit with is a very annoying and confusing thing to do. Feeling wrong and out of place when all you want to do is use the bathroom can make people avoid school bathrooms altogether or just have a bad feeling the entire time. Having neutral bathrooms would make the satisfaction of non-binary students greater, as we would finally have a place to simply use the bathroom without having all these thoughts.

Also, gender neutral bathrooms are a step towards the future. By acknowledging and accepting the non-conforming students, it will make the general awareness of us better, and maybe we wouldn’t have to deal with as many questions and stares when trying to use the bathroom. Because that happens. And it sucks. Having a neutral bathroom is something that many schools are doing in order to accommodate towards all students, something that they are being praised for by most as a way to accept and cater for all students regardless of gender.

A counter-argument that has been heard many times is the risk of ‘peeping toms’ and people using the bathroom for ‘other’ reasons. But these should be low risk. First of all, from what I have heard, it would be a one or a few stalls bathroom, which would be like the boys’ and girls’ ones, with locks. So no one can use this argument against a neutral bathroom, as there would be walls and doors. For the people fearing harassment or ‘other’ issues, the solution is simple. They don’t have to use the gender neutral bathroom. We would still have the girls’ and boys’ bathrooms, so no one should be using the neutral one if they don’t want to. People try to discourage this idea with many arguments about health and safety, but if students don’t agree with this, they can still use the gendered bathrooms. The unisex ones would be for everyone, but if they feel unsafe in them, the problem is easily rectified.

So, this is the proposal for a gender neutral bathroom at \[School name\]. It would benefit many students and make an overall better school for everyone, where everyone can safely and happily go to the bathroom without fuss. It is a simple and hopeful request that we hope can be fulfilled. Please consider the students here and help us get our gender-neutral bathroom that we need. Thank you for reading this.

I thought I might share it with you wonderful people to see what you think. Hopefully it works and we get our bathroom.\n\n60% of transgender or gender non-conforming individuals avoid public bathrooms. There are many reasons for this, ranging from gender dysphoria (the feeling of unease about your gender/body) to general uncomfortability or potential harassment (which I hope our school is better than). I am one of these people, I have friends that do this and I know that there are others in our school that do this. Schools are beginning to implement unisex bathrooms for transgender or gender non-conforming individuals, and we should be one of them. We need to be one of them.\n\nFirst of all, it makes these students more comfortable and feel better about themselves. Being forced to choose between two things you don’t fit with is a very annoying and confusing thing to do. Feeling wrong and out of place when all you want to do is use the bathroom can make people avoid school bathrooms altogether or just have a bad feeling the entire time. Having neutral bathrooms would make the satisfaction of non-binary students greater, as we would finally have a place to simply use the bathroom without having all these thoughts.\n\nAlso, gender neutral bathrooms are a step towards the future. By acknowledging and accepting the non-conforming students, it will make the general awareness of us better, and maybe we wouldn’t have to deal with as many questions and stares when trying to use the bathroom. Because that happens. And it sucks.

I'm so extremely scared of their reactions and I don't know what to do. I'm not coming out to my family for awhile as I'm just not ready for their reactions. \n\n TL;DR: Hi, I'm Ali. I'm 21 years old, I'm pansexual, and I am non-binary. How do I come out as non-binary to my friends and family who are not so accepting of non-binary folks (just like I used to be before educating myself and getting over internalized homophobia/transphobia), how do I handle it if they're not supportive, and who do I talk to if they reject me?"", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Coming out', 'created': 1607485852.0}"

Just for a lil info I'm 20 and currently identify as a cis male but starting to question that. 

When I was young I used to like trying on my mom's clothes, I distinctly remember stuffing the bra with toilet paper rolls and prancing around in the bathroom (the only room that locked in my parents house) I did this for a number of years until I learned this was well outside the norm and started to feel disgusted with myself for wanting that. Since then I've always fantasized about being a girl or dressing in a feminine way but I've never actually indulged because of that same disgust I have whenever I consider trying it. 

Since I started therapy I've started to feel a bit more comfortable with myself and able to curb that disgusted feeling to allow myself to explore this more. I enjoy wearing feminine things that aren't visible to other people however I strongly prefer to present as a man in public. 

Some of my friends have said this aligns well with their experience of being nb and others have said you can't be nb without desiring some sort of physical change or experiencing gender dysphoria. 

I have always thought if some higher powered being offered me the chance to have been born as a girl instead I would 100% take it but things like drag or transitioning I am confident are not things I want to participate in.

I've been hearing this a lot online since Elliot Page came out, but I have heard this idea long before then too.  There is this idea that lesbians are abandoning identifying as lesbians and are instead coming outn as enby or as male in order to escape misogyny.  As an AFAB enby who presents as a bit more femme, this idea makes no sense for a couple reasons:

1. First, who actively avoids misogyny by jumping headfirst into transphobia?  This doesn't even make sense to me.  Hell, a lot of enbies present as feminine to various degrees so we face both misogyny and transphobia in our day to day lives.  I've dealt with various forms of misogyny since I was a kid and I still experience it to this day to various degrees.  Coming out as enby didn't make the misogyny magically go away because most people still view me as female even when they already know my gender (usually because they don't actually believe it's a real gender).  I've heard my coworkers refer to me as ""the girl who doesn't know she's a girl"".  So the idea that I'm enby to escape misogyny is ludicrous to me.  I won't speak on behalf of trans men because I'm not one, but I'm sure a lot of them have dealt with misogyny before transitioning and as they came out they had to deal with transphobia to various degrees.  Some may still do years after transitioning depending on their current social situation.
2. Gender identity isn't something people choose based on the bigotry they face in their lives.  Trans men aren't men because they're escaping misogyny, they're men because they're men.  I'm not enby to escape misogyny, I'm enby because after a lot of soul searching I realized that's the label that best describes myself and my relationship to my body and my self.  I'd still be enby even if misogyny never existed.  It's just part of who I am.
3. A lot of enbies self-identify as lesbians.  So...yeah, how does that work in this scenario?  That's allowed, by the way.  You can be an enby lesbian!

I (they/them, 27) first started looking into getting top surgery about a year ago after casually thinking about it for awhile.

It feels very surreal and exciting. However, a lot of doubt is running through my mind after trying to celebrate with my mom. While she is supportive, she can be insensitive with her words. I told her that she poisoned what should have been a really exciting moment for me. And I truly feel that way.

That's pretty creepy...) another shocking moment was when I accidentally tried out a female Snapchat filter (this gender swapping type) I mean I was good looking in the picture but that was totally not me! Since then I'm even more confused than usual. From age 16 to 28 or so I identified as a lesbian and made this a big part of my identity, then out of the blue I fell in love with a guy (to whom I'm married now, even though I mainly think of him as a like-minded person) which made me think, okay, maybe I'm pansexual or something and gender is overrated anyway. Now I'm trying to find any clues in retrospect that might give me some hint to where on the spectrum I actually am. I don't know why but somehow this is getting more and more important for me to know. What I know is that I have always been more attracted to people who were somewhere ""in between"" (either more maskulin women or more feminine men) 

Another clue might be that whenever I think about feminism I feel more like an ally than somebody involved in the topic (hard to explain, since (cis-)men can be feminists, too) 

Now to my main question: besides having the constant feeling that something is wrong with me (which might have various reasons) and the feeling of not belonging to the ""average"" kind of people, I think I haven't experienced severe dysphoria (yet?). It's more like I'm a completely different species if that makes sense.

Maybe I'm overthinking as usual but if I had to label myself it would probably be agender so part of me thinks I'm excluded from either team now (silly, I know).

If you say you're non-binary, what does that mean? You still have an organ that defines your gender, even if you feel like the opposite sex, or feel like both sexes.

2020-12-10 19:13:26,kalu57,4,1,"Any advice to getting through a breakup. This was my first relationship, we dated from August 2019-June 2020. I am 22F, my partner is 21 (they first identified as male when we got together, then over quarantine came out as non-binary, and now also go by she/her pronouns and are thinking of transitioning) I’ve never experienced any situation like this and never thought I would, or expected them to ever change like that. I was very supportive when they came out and am still one of the most supportive people in their lives. 

They realized over quarantine that they are not actually bisexual and are fully gay. They told me that I wasn’t like any other girl and that I was different which made them so in love with me and attracted to me. They said despite the fact that they’re gay they would stay with me because they are in love with me. They said I’m just so good for them that they don’t need anything else at the moment (they are polyamorous). We stayed together during quarantine but right after we could finally see each other they said we shouldn’t say we’re dating and broke up with me. They said we could continue to do everything we did romantically just without the label.

We continued to have a best friends with benefits and romance and said we’d slowly break up to ease the pain. It was their idea to slowly breakup but weeks later they started moving on faster in their head and then said they didn’t feel comfortable doing friends with benefits anymore. Specifically because of the dysphoria it caused them, and also they said it confused them that they still desired me despite the fact they were gay. But then in July right after saying they didn’t wanna be intimate anymore we were intimate one night and they said we don’t have to cut it off quickly because they loved kissing me. That next day we hung out and they were being weird and just ended our hang out and that’s when we decided to take a break.

We took a break from seeing each other (3 weeks) then in August met up and they said they think their romantic feelings for me had fully gone away. I was hurt because my feelings were still there and I hadn’t made any progress. Fast forward to September we have both helped each other move into our own apartments downtown right by each other. In September I finally had my own space, we remained just friends except one night they admitted that they still had some sexual feelings towards me and for some reason I’m the only girl they desire. We ended up being intimate.

Right after that they said that I was the last girl they’d ever have sex with and this was the last time they’d have sex with a girl. I felt completely hurt once again because they made it seem like they wanted to make this a thing, and it just seemed like they used me to be like hmm am I still sexually into women. They said they were excited about it because they thought it’d be a thing but was disappointed that they weren’t feeling it. They said it wasn’t uncomfortable at all and they actually enjoyed it, but that it was because they don’t love me romantically anymore. They’re very back and forth, they’ve said things like 
“you’re the only true love I’ve ever had”
“you’re the only real romantic connection I’ve ever had”

Basically saying that they aren’t a good actor and can’t fake that love they had for me. But then one night when I got really emotional about trying to get over my feelings they asked me why can’t I just get over them and that they’ll even do something really hurtful right now so that I could get over them. They also said
“I don’t love you romantically!” and 
“I’ve never loved you romantically if you think about it”

I. was. hurt. I was lost for words and all of this stuff they were saying was new and it’s like it wasn’t them.. it’s as if they were only saying it so I’d stop expressing my feelings. How can you be so in love with someone and then all of a sudden act like you never loved them romantically. I’m so confused...

As we’d hang out at our apartments they’ve mentioned stuff like “I’m still getting over it” and “don’t assume how I feel” when I would say that I’m the only one who’s having a hard time getting over the breakup. If they seem so careless how is it that they could even possibly still be “getting over it” I’m so confused...

Ever since that I said I’ll never let myself show any emotion like that around them and now we’ve just been friends. I haven’t brought our relationship back up but trust me I’m still not over it and idk what to do because I don’t want them out of my life but they’ve hurt me so much. They don’t text me back on time lately and I get they’re going through things (extreme gender dysphoria and losing their best friend and sister over an argument) but I just feel like everything they said means nothing anymore. They say they don’t wanna lose me as a best friend but they just seem so careless lately and it hurts a lot. Its like they’ve completely moved on and are a whole new person. It’s like I’ve not only lost my partner but my best friend also... I’m just hurt

I was lost for words and all of this stuff they were saying was new and it’s like it wasn’t them.. it’s as if they were only saying it so I’d stop expressing my feelings. How can you be so in love with someone and then all of a sudden act like you never loved them romantically. I’m so confused...\n\nAs we’d hang out at our apartments they’ve mentioned stuff like “I’m still getting over it” and “don’t assume how I feel” when I would say that I’m the only one who’s having a hard time getting over the breakup. If they seem so careless how is it that they could even possibly still be “getting over it” I’m so confused...\n\nEver since that I said I’ll never let myself show any emotion like that around them and now we’ve just been friends. I haven’t brought our relationship back up but trust me I’m still not over it and idk what to do because I don’t want them out of my life but they’ve hurt me so much. They don’t text me back on time lately and I get they’re going through things (extreme gender dysphoria and losing their best friend and sister over an argument) but I just feel like everything they said means nothing anymore. They say they don’t wanna lose me as a best friend but they just seem so careless lately and it hurts a lot. Its like they’ve completely moved on and are a whole new person. It’s like I’ve not only lost my partner but my best friend also... I’m just hurt \n\nthere’s so much that goes into this.. but any advice?

2020-12-10 20:56:29,kao0tz,1,1,"Hi everyone. I am a 25 y.o. AFAB genderqueer person with very boring parents, who named me a painfully generic feminine name. My dad's family is filled with truly atrocious people, and I no longer wish to carry his family's name. He's an ok guy, but his family is really messed up and the last name is rare so it 100% identifies me as a family member. I have been using they/them pronouns for roughly 3-4 years now and it just feels time to stop going by my boring, traditionally feminine name. For all those reasons, I want to change my name to something that resonates with me and excites me. 

I am big on name symbolism and ancestry, so I wanted my new name to pay homage to my Irish, German, and Slavic ancestors while also containing a symbolic meaning in the name itself. I spent (truly) 72 hours + a 14-day free trial of ancestry.com to determine what I wanted my new name to be. And I decided on my perfect name about a month ago. I look at pictures of myself and say, ""is this OLDNAME or NEWNAME?"" and I get very excited at the thought of my physical self being recognized as NEWNAME. It doesn't feel like ""coming home"" like I've heard it does, but it feels like the confident, creative person I want to be has Newname and the old, scared, complacent person I don't want to be anymore is Oldname.

So, I took the typical next step of having a few close friends call me by the new name to build confidence (which is silly bc I barely see anyone at all in this pandemic), since I have never gone by a nickname or penname or anything like that before. My roommate- who is trans, and who is the only person I see on a daily basis- can't get my name right. Like I said, it's been a month, and I still have to remind her every time what my name is. It's very disheartening and making it hard to justify ever going by this name in real life. If my trans best friend and roommate who has also changed her name 3 times can't get this right, how will there ever be hope of anyone getting it right? 

I just started a new school and have been going by Newname there, but it feels wrong. This feels like the kind of situation where it has to be all or nothing. I can't and don't want to go by both names, or I'll feel like a fraud. I think I'll feel like a failure if I don't go all in and change my name, but I don't know what my next step should be. I don't know how to go about changing my name at my job of 2 years or even on Facebook fully without feeling like I've somehow fucked up. The anxiety of social perception is playing with my true desires.

Any advice on how to change my name in all these places? Im not worried about a legal change right now, just a social name change to start.

2020-12-10 21:20:33,kaoi8g,3,1,"Just wondering if anyone else has experience with cutting off, avoiding, or not feeling comfortable around friends who knew you before you acknowledged you were non binary?

I have had a strong urge to cut off communication with people that knew me when I thought I was cis or when i was trying to convince myself I was cis/a binary woman. At first I thought it was for other reasons- I've had substance abuse issues that were worse when I was around them, and some of them have been insensitive and hurt my feelings about things not even related to gender. But after some reflection it feels like its more about a feeling that they don't really know me and can't possibly know me because we all got close before I came to terms with being non binary. 

This has all been really scary and guilt inducing. They haven't done anything egregiously wrong and I can tell they're all pretty confused about me dropping them. Some of them are queer and they're all supportive of me in this journey but i still feel misunderstood. My best friend did make some snarky comment kind of making fun of me a long time ago when I suggested that I want to change my name to something less feminine and that moment still stings in my heart when I think about it- but is that grounds to cut someone off? I have a tendency towards avoidance- so I'm trying to catch myself if I'm actually just making excuses to cut people off who haven't been perfect out of fear of being hurt. 

I'm also scared because I'm basically starting at square one socially, and trying to make new queer friends is daunting.

Can't tell if I'm just tormenting myself or trying to get a ""full picture"" of things. Please click away if this is likely to cause you emotional or psychological distress. :)* 

Background about me: Hi, I'm new. I'm 27 AFAB, generally GNC but have been really thinking hard about gender stuff and the options available regarding gender expression during quarantine (like everyone, right?) I tick off a bunch of the ""egg"" requirements, and have been somewhere in the nonbinary/butch area of gender expression for much of my life. (I went hard on the lady-drag when I worked at the mall, and to some extent pushed myself in that direction during my first serious/sexual relationship which was with a cishet guy in college.) As you can tell from ""lady drag"" I have moments where I am femme presenting but don't find that to be, uh, representative of my ""self"". 

I spent six months away from home during early quarantine-times, living with my grandmother, and generally being in a social environment where my peers were certain LGB-friendly, but where the T or other gender-bending has not penetrated the society very deeply. It was lady-drag all day, every day, without respite. When i realized I needed to get a binder to help alleviate some of my twitchiness, and finding myself in an (online) environment with really strong trans involvement and representation, and without anything to take my mind off it, I started to really delve back into the question of my own gender identity and presentation and the general... messiness thereof. 

Current dilemma: So i've been lurking in this sub and in r/ftm and a few other places in the last week or so (including a lot of NSFW stuff, whoops) trying to get a grip on what kinds of changes occur with things like HRT and some of the *mechanical* aspects of transition. Puberty was scary and unpleasant the first time around, I'm not entirely sure I'd like to sign up for round 2. That having been said, there are a number of things about HRT which have always appealed to me (voice changes, fat redistribution, muscle building, to name a few). But I've asked people again and again, cis and trans, how they know what their gender ""feels like"" from the inside, because I don't have a solid sense of what that experience is like. 

This is where the detransition videos come into play in a serious way: a lot of what I hear in these videos is this question of wanting to change their social relationship to gender. Especially with the FTM transitions, things that sound a lot like internalized misogyny and appropriated toxic masculinity run rampant (""Why would you want to be a woman, when that opens you up to being harassed, objectified, put down, etc.?"").... All of which are *very* familiar to me in a way that the oft-heard binary trans narrative of knowing you are the ""other gender"" isn't. 

Confusion about my gender perception/presentation/reception has been a huge part of my life since before I hit puberty: I have been regularly ""misgendered"" since infancy and through both behavior and presentation tended towards a non-binary or GNC uh way of life? (I put ""misgendered"" in quotes here since it just sort of confused and amused me before I hit puberty because it was a ""mistake"" that someone else was making that didn't make sense to me, I was what I had been told I was, right? And then became more affirming after puberty when I had undergone this sudden shift in my position in the world... I was very bad at ""being a girl"".)

My point: a lot of detransitioners talk about having regrets because they wanted a social transition, or some other move towards a GNC identity (whether that is being more ""butch"" or w/e), and given that I've managed to live 27 years as a ""girl"" and I've even managed to be happy in spite of it at times (haha), I want to know what other NB/GNC folks feel and think about how they present their identities and negotiate the question of what kind and what level of intervention you think about taking with your body and your presentation to the world at large. People who have taken HRT or low-dose HRT... What has that been like? People who have had surgery but not HRT, what has that been like? Did you just socially transition without any other kind of transition? Do you just say ""gender is made up and the points don't matter""? How do you dig deep and find your ""authentic self""?

If you made it this far: thanks for reading.

Hi! Hope you are having a good day/night!

(sorry for any mistake, I’m kinda new to reddit and English is my second language)

I've been questioning my gender recently (AFAB) and I'm not sure if I'm non-binary. It has been kind of weird because I'm 20 and just now I started to question things (even though I might remember a couple of things of my childhood that make sense now that I'm questioning). Since the pandemic started and we were forced to be at home all the time I've noticed certain discomfort when I see myself in the mirror everyday (especially when seeing my chest), and I've been more aware of the pronouns people use when referring to me, but I'm insecure and don't really know if this is indeed something deeper than just overthinking things.

Right now I've tried using other pronouns with my friends and I found out I don't mind using she or he pronouns interchangeably (unfortunately, in Spanish we dont really have gender neutral pronouns, but I've tried using ""He"" from time to time). Also, I've tried to put what I feel into words to talk to a friend about my concerns and the only thing I said was ""sometimes I want to be pretty, sometimes I want to be handsome"" to summarise my thoughts. Even though I like to wear dresses and being more feminine (from time to time), I would really love to have a more gender neutral style or having more masculine clothes. I've asked myself if I would like to be a man before, but that doesn't feel right to me, but being a woman doesnt feel completely right either.

I know that every experience is different, but I would like to know how you realize you were non-binary. Idk, Maybe knowing about other people's experiences might help a bit to understand me better.

I don't have trans/nonbinary friends in my inner circle and so I don't really have anyone I can go to for advice. I would really appreciate any opinions/thoughts/discussion.

I suppose my question is: when did it click for you ? What moment was it that it became clear to you exactly which label fit yourself?

I am AFAB. I like traditionally ""girly"" things, like makeup and dresses... but also since I was very young, I wanted very badly to be a boy. I also played with boy things, video games, stolen my brother's clothes to try on in secret (until I got caught and they just started giving me hand me downs). I used to wish on stars that I could have been born with a different sex. 

But as I got older, the feeling faded. It never really went away; I still sometimes see men's clothing and think, I wish I could wear that. I recently cut my hair very short, and I feel extremely happy at how boy-ish I look. But at the same time, I've accepted the way my body looks now. Sometimes, people mistake me for a man and call me sir and I feel flattered by it. My wonderful fiancé lets me wear his clothes when I feel like mine don't look nice.

I came out as a lesbian when I was 16, to my family. Then later, I fell in love with a man. Which was a whole other confusing situation. I still am attracted to women, but my fiancé is the love of my life even though he is a man.

i also remembered a story from my childhood.

ok i moved to a new school in elementary school and the recess had a game where it was like tag with spies idk and i was remembering what my mom said to me “just walk out to recess and say hi to the first person you see” and so that’s what i did and it was a guy named chase and what he said to me “are you on the boy team or the girl team” and i was just like “wtf”

and don’t get my started with my backstory, i was in an awful care accident a few years back and i paralyzed the left side of my body, when i awoke i described how “lefty” felt like someone had ripped off half my body and replaced it with an identical alien half. my leg and arm still don’t always listen to me. on top of that i’ve recently become a cyborg as i have a battery implanted in me to shock my nerves, so that’s real weird.

Hey pals, I’m currently feeling more and more comfortable with my nb identity (though am not really out yet to most people). I had a question, which I hope isn’t triggering but potentially might be for some folks, FYI: I wondered if anyone describes themselves as their biological sex instead of saying their agab . For example I’m afab, and am not comfortable with pronouns she/her, or being described as a woman etc, my gender is nb, pronouns they/them. But sometimes I use female to describe my experience or body, ie: because I’m female presenting blah blah blah, or because I have a female body (vagina or whatever), i think I especially say in when talking about sex. I know this can be useful in a necessary medical context and that a lot of people won’t use it because it might out them or make them feel dysphoric/uncomfortable. I also think it might just be a replacement for afab because I’m not out yet to a lot of people so it’s a way to fly under the radar a bit, calling myself a female instead of a woman, makes me a bit more comfortable. I guess another question is whether female/male counts as a gender or a sex, maybe both? In my brain it’s sex but maybe I’m conflating the two.

Listen, it’s not that I’m not supportive. I AM. I absolutely am and I want to do everything I can. But talking about it gives me that stomach churning anxiety and when I try the words don’t come. 
There’s a reason. It’s not that I just don’t understand. It’s that I’ve been avoiding anything and everything non-binary since I learned what it was.

However, the real question behind these thoughts were less about gender identity but more about masculinity as a whole : what defines it, how society views it, how ""traditional"" it is, and evidently, how do I reconcile or identify with it when toxic masculinity is strongly attached to its concept, and I don't recognize myself at all in this, even in some of the non-toxic traits of masculinity. I'm posting this today because these thoughts are still buried deep somewhere inside my brain.

I'm a sensitive, romantic, artistic guy with little to no interest in sports, and while I know it doesn't define my gender identity, these are the kind of traits that are more attributed to women than men, and I can recognize myself a bit in this. So, this is for the internal part of myself, but as for the external, while I do want to explore a little more my gender expression (or maybe I'm confusing gender expression simply with preferences in dressing and how I just want to look ?) by letting my hair grow, wearing eyeliner and maybe lipstick and jewelry, I do admire feminity but I'd still want to be recognized as a man. I feel like masculinity is quite restricting in that aspect, but a look back at History reminds me that men used to be like this, and in a more modern context I love the confidence emanating from men like Robert Smith and David Bowie in that regard.

Sorry for rambling a bit more than I expected, now I'd love to read your opinions on this, and maybe explain what does the non-binary gender identity means to you (as it's something fluid and personal, maybe I would find myself in what you'd come up with more than Wikipedia's or dictionnaries definitions !).

2020-12-12 22:05:55,kby2ml,2,1,"Hello!

I just joined this sub after looking around to see where I can place my feet back into the concrete and get my identity set in stone since I dislike uncertainty, and right now it seems my feet are floating above a few identities and im a little unsure.

for background when I was 13 I was slightly confused with my gender identity (i am AFAB) or rather my feeling of discomfort around femininity at the time. I felt I resonated more with the male presenting aspects in people around me (i.e. deeper voices, facial hair, flatter physique etc.) and at the time due to my naivety to the socially constructed binary of gender, I assumed I was a trans man.

I got to 14 and had entirely gotten out of that stage, I often assume it was due to me never properly experimenting due to fear of cutting my hair, I never used different pronouns and my name is unisex so I was essentially just mentally processing the fact I could perhaps be trans, but had nothing to solidly confirm that idea. By the point that had passed I identified as cisgender heterosexual.

at around 15 I thought I was bi but was in complete denial after my confusion with gender some time before so I pushed it aside. only just now at 16 I identify/ed as sapphic before moving to nblw exclusively due to exclus, terfs etc. and so on pushing me out of the lesbian label I found comfort in. so I now tootle around the sapphic label but not entirely as I'm confused with how I identify gender wise.

so, as of present, I've recently been considering where under the gender non-binary I exactly fit. I often still want to present masculinley, but not all the time.

when I'm in discord calls, or phone calls, sending voice notes and so on I always try to listen back to myself during or after and more often than not feel discomfort with the fact my voice is feminine.

yet with my visual presentation im quite comfortable with presenting femininley. clothing wise I've always been androgynous.

I often fluctuate between how I feel I want to present to others and be perceived, its a constant change and im confused as to what label I can safely plant my feet within in order to feel back on the ground and able to comfortably say to other people ""[this] is what I identify as""

I am an AMAB non-binary person considering low dose HRT. I am very excited by the prospect of being on hormones and have no doubts about my identity as a trans-feminine person.

First, I did not exactly find a post discussing fatphobia but I might have overlooked. If there is a subreddit more focused on this topic, please let me know. Whatever reason, I will be more than happy to take this post down.

I will mention body dysmorphia, eating disorder, gender dysphoria and fatphobia in this post. If this is a hard subject for you to read about, I apologize. I am sure we'll cross path another time with more delightful subject.




I am asexual homoromantic AFAB. I am comfortable loving a woman, and I am happy without any sexual activities and not being sexually pursued. I really did not have any issue with my gender and sexuality until my body dysmorphia and fat phobia got worse. However, this is around the time when I started to more educate myself with sexuality and gender so I was a bit lost in this.

I am not stereotypically a feminine person. I do not wear any clothing items that are usually assigned to feminine bodies, not wear jewelry, make up or perfume, etc. However, I do not do that partially because I think gender roles and requiring women to wear clothes with no pockets, painting their faces and making themselves ""presentable"" is bs. About this, few of my friends thought I was FtM but I did not want to be identified as a male. I was fine with using ""she/her"" pronouns, etc.

To be honest, I do not care what people call me or how they identify me. I do not have strong bond with any gender expression or identity. I wear what I want and I do what I want. One side of my closet looks like it belongs to a teenage boy and the other side looks like it belongs to a lady working in HR. While strongly leaning towards the teenage boy side, I still wear both of those clothes based on occasions.

Shifting gears. After quarantine started, I gained some weight and this triggered my body dysmorphia and eating disorder. I started to avoid form fitting clothes - or any clothes that shows my fat on my arm. thigh, belly, etc. It made me feel better that there was not cloth touching between my chest and upper arm that scrunched up between and making me feel terrible.

Part of my hatred for my body aimed my breast. I have generous amount of fat attached to my breast, and the fear of gaining weight started a thought train that repeated ""You are so fat your tits are big and ugly"". I wanted to throw up every time my boobs touched my ribcage as I slouched over. I was happy that my oversized hoodies and shirts did not accentuate my curves. But the same feeling was triggered anytime my body parts jiggled in some way, so I was not sure if this was a gender thing or just internalized fat phobia.

I was wondering if anybody has similar experience like me. I am sure that I need a therapist so I will find one when I find enough courage scraped from the bottom of my cowardly heart.

TL;DR [AFAB] I do not have strong attachment to either side of binary. I do not experience a visceral hatred anytime somebody addresses me as a woman but I do not like having breast. I do not identify as male but I often dress like one. I hate myself for being fat and part of me feel like having breast is part of being fat.

Yesterday my son* told me he thinks he’s non-binary. I told him I support him whatever or whoever he is. He asked what he should do and I told him he didn’t have to do anything. But I also asked him if he felt like he wanted to do something. He replied that he wanted to explore the matter. I said that that sounded like a good idea and I would seek out resources that he might find helpful or that we could look at together. 

If you have any recommendations for resources that he/we might find helpful, I’d really appreciate it. He’s 12. What I would say is a pretty young 12, if that makes sense and matters. That is, he’s very much into kid things like kid-focused anime, video games, etc.

2020-12-13 16:22:32,kcddro,1,1,"Hi all. I recently came out as demiboy (I'm 19 amab) after a bit of wrestling with my gender identity, but I'm still not entirely sure if that's correct for me. 

Ive always had a weird relationship with gender, even as a young kid. For some history, when I was 7 I proudly said I wished I had both sets of sex chromosomes, but then change my appearance to be a boy so that I could still look like me but win arguments like girls could. I also had no problem doing the more ""girly"" things and actually thought they were pretty normal. 

Throughout school, I never had a problem being grouped together with the girls, and I would often prefer it. I felt really disconnected from the other guys in my schools for the most part. That being said, I also never considered myself a girl, just a boy who was more comfortable being addressed collectively in a group of girls as ""ladies"" or ""girls"" by a teacher than singularly as ""boy"" or ""young man"". ""Mister [last name] always made me feel a bit iffy too. I much preferred Master. 

When puberty started to hit, I got really annoyed with my body hair. I think it's unsightly and uncomfortable, so now I shave it off when I can be bothered. But I do like to have some facial hair. Currently, I dress in men's clothing, but nothing particularly masculine. Most often a plain t-shirt and slim jeans. I've started trying to buy some feminine clothing and have felt really good when trying on items that aren't as masculine as I'm used to. 

Demiboy resonated with me when I first researched it as it was described as ""partly male, partly something else"". I'm fairly sure it fits what I feel, but all this history has made me question if there might be a better one (or maybe I'm just put off by the word ""boy"" in the label :P and can probably just say demiguy to make it sound more comfortable in my head).

2020-12-13 21:52:56,kcjoli,4,1,"For the record, I dont wish for anyone to change the way they are for my comfort. This isnt a transphobia post. I mean, maybe slightly, but I'm trying to be honest so I can figure this out and fix it. Also, I understand it is not trans(which I say including non binary) people's job to 'fix' me. This has just been in the back of my mind and I thought I'd post it here to see if writing things down helps clear it up and in case anyone has any thoughts they'd like to share with me. Im a lesbian and I go by she/her pronouns. It's probably worth noting that I grew/am growing up in a transphobic/homophobic/misogynistic household. I think I may be non binary myself, but I dont think I want to use they/them pronouns. When others use they/them pronouns it causes me a bit of anxiety trying not to misgender them, almost like it feels unnatural. Maybe it's because I've never seen they/them as pronouns, but more of a plural? My SO also uses they/she pronouns and I think because I'm so in love with her/them it feels more natural. I feel slightly uncomfortable with she/her pronouns myself but they/them doesn't seem completely right. I also tend to look at non binary people and think of them as their agab when it's obvious.

I think I may be non binary myself, but I dont think I want to use they/them pronouns. When others use they/them pronouns it causes me a bit of anxiety trying not to misgender them, almost like it feels unnatural. Maybe it's because I've never seen they/them as pronouns, but more of a plural? My SO also uses they/she pronouns and I think because I'm so in love with her/them it feels more natural.

2020-12-14 00:59:26,kcn2qt,9,1,"I get frustrated sometimes because I can't seem to find any other nonbinary people like me. I definitely have a solid, constant gender, but it has nothing to do with being male or female. But it also isn't a lack of gender. (Which is why I no longer use they/them pronouns, I just know I have a solid gender they/them was too vague for me. They/them just wasn't a good fit.)

But since I literally don't have the words to categorize it, I have no idea how to find other people with the same gender! The closest words I have to describe it are vague concepts (like personifying it, but at that point I'm just personifying my IDEAL form in general and it isn't even about my gender anymore) and gendered terms of presenting. 

Like ideally I would be trending ""masculine"" but with a ""feminine"" or eccentric clothing style. But those aren't even helpful, because I want nothing to with masculinity! I don't want to be *masculine*, and I don't feel *masculine*, it's just that semi-masculine is how my ideal body would be perceived by other people so that's literally the only word I have to describe it aside from describing the specific traits I want! 

It's so frustrating because I know that even describing how I'd want to look or act isn't enough to find people with the same gender as me, becuase **wanting to look a specific way isn't a gender!** It is at times heartbreaking to know that in my lifetime I will NEVER have the words to describe myself, and even if I met someone experiencing the same thing there'd be no way to figure out if we had the same gender or not, and I can't help but feel bitter. 

And making up a name for it isn't solid enough for me, because I have a hard time giving words that I personally define a lot of meaning. And it also doesn't help with finding other people who have the same gender because if I'm the only one to use the word then it's basically meaningless! But also I can't figure out if people have the same gender as me so there wouldn't even be a way to make sure everyone using the word was ACTUALLY my gender!

I don\'t want to be *masculine*, and I don\'t feel *masculine*, it\'s just that semi-masculine is how my ideal body would be perceived by other people so that\'s literally the only word I have to describe it aside from describing the specific traits I want! \n\nIt\'s so frustrating because I know that even describing how I\'d want to look or act isn\'t enough to find people with the same gender as me, becuase **wanting to look a specific way isn\'t a gender!** It is at times heartbreaking to know that in my lifetime I will NEVER have the words to describe myself, and even if I met someone experiencing the same thing there\'d be no way to figure out if we had the same gender or not, and I can\'t help but feel bitter. \n\nAnd making up a name for it isn\'t solid enough for me, because I have a hard time giving words that I personally define a lot of meaning. And it also doesn\'t help with finding other people who have the same gender because if I\'m the only one to use the word then it\'s basically meaningless! But also I can\'t figure out if people have the same gender as me so there wouldn\'t even be a way to make sure everyone using the word was ACTUALLY my gender! BECAUSE I DON\'T HAVE A WAY TO DESCRIBE IT, so what would people relating to it even be relating to??\n\nAnyone else just incessantly frustrated by stuff like this??', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Knowing your gender but not having the words for it.', 'created': 1607932766.0}"

2020-12-14 01:18:54,kcneqi,4,1,"Not really sure what I want to say here, but I've been wanting to get it off my chest. 

Growing up, I always felt like I was made a bit different than all the other boys. I never cared much for ""typically masculine"" activities. I always related and felt more myself around girls, and my sisters friends. I'm sure there are stories of me wanting to play with them, and being told no. I'm sure my mother wasn't too keen on having a son that enjoyed girls things. 

Let's fast forward a bit, as a budding youth in the clutches of puberty. Or what was supposed to be the clutches of puberty. I just didnt care as much, or at all, about what the other men were doing. Dating, kissing, all that, hard pass really. Eventually I did start dating but it wasnt really fulfilling and it felt more like I was doing it because I was supposed to. 

Theres more to this cause memories are a thing, but I cant make heads or tails of them. 

Life likes to throw you curveballs. Did some soul searching a while back, and finally learned about asexuality and came to the realization that hey, I'm asexual! That's pretty neat and makes a whole lot of sense. My wife, girlfriend at the time (we've been together 10 years now), has been supportive of me, and we're making it work for us. 

Now comes the even scarier part: How do I tell her about all the other things? How do I bring up the fact that I dont necessarily feel comfortable as a man anymore? Granted, I've always said I've felt more feminine, but never gave it a second thought, cause it's true, y'know? But now that I'm older, and theres more inclusion and representation, it's got me really thinking. I dont think I'm a girl, or anything, I just dont really think I'm either? Non-binary honestly sounds like it fits me; full irony with men clothes never fitting me either. 

So I guess that's where I'm at... Pretty damn sure. Sexual orientation? None Gender? None, idk, both? 

The next step is what I'm most afraid of. My wife and close friends are the only ones who know I'm asexual, havent told any family members.

So recently I've been thinking a lot about my pronouns. Or more accurately about how they suck XD

They/Them is the closest but not because I like it but because I know that the people who use it for me inform me that they AT THE BEAR MINIMUM respect my identity to that degree.

It doesn't feel RIGHT either but you know it's ¯\_(⊙_ʖ⊙)_/¯ Toe at least, they all are just meaningless scribbles on paper anyway.

2020-12-14 04:58:52,kcr0m4,4,1,"So I’ve been flip-flopping between identities for many many years. I’m 22, and sometime early on in high school I admitted to a friend that I was “probably bi, but I’d never DO anything about it :^)”. As I got older, I slowly realized over and over again that I liked girls a little more than I thought I did. And my language evolved too. I was a “side b bi” with a preference for girls and a heart for Jesus. 
And suddenly I’m 20, ending a 3 year relationship because I finally broke down and admitted to myself that I just don’t find men physically attractive. So, I’m a lesbian. Right? Just a.. regular old lesbian, embracing that tomboy she squashed all those years ago. Just kinda butch. ...other butches like the idea of binding, right?? Like they usually dislike their chests and hips and being perceived as feminine. Right??
From what I’ve learned for the online butch communities I’ve lurked in, the answer is sure, sometimes. It’s complicated, and individual, and weird. As (currently) an outsider, I think it’s beautiful. As an individual, it’s kinda scary. I’ve had to unlearn a whole lot of false information I thought was absolute, but I’m not sure I’ve fully broken down those automatic thoughts that judge nonbinary&amp;gnc people and force stereotypes on them in my mind. I think a lot of that is coming from me trying to decide if I’m... actually allowed to pursue this beautiful in-between, or if I’m just wrong again. Like, what if I’ve tricked myself into thinking I like girls, even?? What if it’s all just some pc-culture slippery slope? What if the next step is invariably being a trans man and going on T and being unable to fully de-transition when it all falls apart? 
...I don’t feel like I have much in common with men. I don’t think I would want to be in male spaces, or wear strictly male coded clothing, or have men see me as a man. I feel like I want to be a little bigger, a little stronger, a little flatter and broader and more confusing to look at. I have a very solid idea in my mind, in this moment, of who I could look like. And I’ve never seen someone who looks just that way. With T-anchor scars laced with drawings of ferns and subtle abs beneath solid flesh and sun tanned shoulders that freckle a little. 
I don’t feel like I have much in common with women. I don’t think I want my family, friends, or future partners to see me as a woman or expect me to take the role of one. I don’t want strangers to take one look at me and be sure of where I started.

2020-12-14 09:31:03,kcuijy,2,1,"First post (ever, anywhere) about my gender, so please be gentle.

Most of my life I’ve comfortably identified as female (AFAB). I’ve also known I was a lesbian since I was about 13. I’ve always been quite “tomboy” and thought of myself as such. As a kid I had a skater boy aesthetic but as a teenager I grew more interested in also exploring femininity through makeup and fashion.

However lately I’ve been wondering if I’m on the femme side of the non binary spectrum. There are times I feel very masculine and have masculine fantasies and other times I feel feminine. I have a buzz cut which feels masculine but often wear dresses and such. I like both she and they pronouns for myself but I’m not entirely sure about “they” only because because it feels like I’m making a statement by claiming it. The other thing is that I’m not sure if I truly belong on the non binary spectrum or if I’m simply experiencing being outside of the normal cisgender identity due to being gay, and it’s my sexuality more than my gender that has me rejecting stereotypically feminine traits. 

The last thing is that I’ve always hated my chest (which is quite large) and dreamed of being flat but again I’m not sure if that’s just because I’m athletic and prefer being lean or if it’s because of gender dysmorphia. And if I am NB, I don’t know if it’s okay/accurate to call myself lesbian anymore.",NonBinary,I don’t know what my gender is,1607963463.0,"{'created_utc': 1607938263, 'id': 'kcuijy', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'First post (ever, anywhere) about my gender, so please be gentle.\n\nMost of my life I’ve comfortably identified as female (AFAB).

2020-12-14 09:33:08,kcujf5,1,1,"Down the middle
I don't mention this all too often
As I do like letting others wonder
But the time has come for me to represent
And inform you I'm non-binary transgender

Sometimes when I share this,
The other will apologise
And say ""oh, how hard it must be""
So I tell them that it's considerably more fun
Than trying to squish in to the binary

Wanna see a balanced human? 
Look to the edge of convention 
The man who feels pretty in a skirt and
The women who shout louder than men 

Yes, I sometimes feel lonely
And it often feels like noone wants me
Or they only desire me platonically
But I'd choose loneliness any day
Over feeling pressure to not be me
To live so stereotypically 
To deny nature so stubbornly 
To fit into roles humanity
Wants to evolve away from anyway
We are here to learn polarity 
Not be caged by it indefinitely 
So I'll continue to let go of what's not me
And hope you'll join me in feeling free 

Burn the rule book
Stamp tradition
Be your own other half
Break the condition
And relate to the world as a human rather than as a man or a woman
Cuz everyone likes to feel pretty sometimes
And everyone likes to feel strong
Everyone likes to feel in control
And everyone likes to flow

If you wanna explore your gender do it
If you wanna explore your sexuality do it
If you wanna explore altered states do it
If you wanna explore other cultures do it
If you wanna explore alternative lifestyles 
If you wanna get good at something do it
If you wanna burn it all down do it

Burn it all down
Build up from the ground 
When it stops glowing
Come on back around

Life's too short for a soul to go stale
So let's put on a show for the highlight reel 

I'm gonna be the most human human who ever lived
The hetero homo
Bi demi pan romantic
The boy with boobs
And the chick with the dick 
The anarchofascist
Hedonistic ascetic
The socio'n'empathic and
Hilariously tragic 
Martyr King and Queen Jester fantastic

So let's dance
In our pants
And celebrate 
How fucking mad it is we're even here 
You, out of every other sperm it could have been
You out of every other you you could have been 
You, out of everyone else that could have been 
What did you make it here to learn? 
To fit a star through a square hole? 
Or fit into the only you shaped keyhole in the world? 

What might we do once we all fit in place? 
I'm not sure there's much out there that we couldn't face 
All that's between us and that harmonic space 
Is to accept all the different forms It can take

So to anyone out there that might like to sing
Let's point our choruses towards the same holy thing
And declare to universe

I currently identify as an AMAB Non-binary person and use they/them pronouns; and I recently looked on this subreddit and saw posts discussing stuff about being an AMAB Non-binary person and about Dysphoria. They were quite helpful in narrowing down how I feel about my gender. First of all I actually didn't know that AMAB Non-binary folk were rare which is quite interesting but additionally it was quite informative looking at how another AMAB enby has experienced gender themselves. Now onto the stuff about Dysphoria, the post simply asked 'can you be non-binary and not experience dysphoria' and the replies were really interesting. I originally thought that to experience being non-binary or trans you need to have dysphoria but hearing that it's more about the euphoria is really helpful! Most of this gender questioning stuff is quite recent for me but I did experience something similar like a year or two ago. Anyway as stated previously I currently identify as an AMAB Non-binary person but I think I may also be transfemme. It's hard to describe how I feel about it tbh, I haven't really considered that I may be transfemme for ages because I was in the mindset of no no I must be a man and all that jazz (before discovering that I am non-binary). But recently I have been mulling over the thoughts in my head and being a 'woman' does give me joy so yeah I dunno. I do think that wearing and doing more feminine things would make me happy and the same for occasionally being androgynous in my expression.

But recently I've been learning a lot about the gender binary and it got me thinking. I let myself explore more masc gender expression and really like it. I love the idea of looking ambiguous and feel quite fluid. 

I'm not curvy at all so I can easily hide my chest, which I do more and more and I like it. Some days I'm fine with my chest and some days I sorta wish I didn't have anything there at all... 

I have a memory from when I was 15 and wore a much more masc outfit than I usually would. I remember vividly liking how androgenous I looked and actually googling binders, though I never went for it.

I have spoken to my best friend about maybe using they/she and she's helped me 'test it out' in private. But I feel like such a massive imposter because I haven't *always known*. I've had sleepless nights and anxiety over this recent period of questioning and yet I still tell myself it's not legitimate. I feel Non-Binary a lot of the time, maybe genderqueer specifically.

2020-12-15 00:13:11,kda9d0,8,1,"Sup. I'm a AFAB non-binary person who's a minor, uses they/them pronouns, and \*wants\* to go by the name Janus. Sadly, my mom and dad aren't really that happy about it. 

Basically, about 6 months ago I came out to my family as agender/non-binary and told them that I don't identify with being a girl or a boy. A few months ago (like maybe 2) I asked my mom if I could change my name to Janus. Not legally or anything, just if she could start calling me Janus instead of my ultra feminine birth name. The answer was no. She said that because the name Janus was related to lying in pop culture (dispute the god Janus not having any association to lying whatsoever) that I shouldn't use it. I knew that it was associated with lying, and I didn't care. I told her that. The whole conversation escalated into a fight and we eventually just dropped it. So, although I was pissed, I'm an anxiety filled teen with a habit of internalizing my emotions, so I didn't bring it up again.

Until tonight.

I had a talk with my therapist, and she convinced me to talk to my mom about the name thing again, so I did. Again, she brought up the lying thing at that people will have ""unconscious biases"" or whatever. Again, I said that I'm willing to take that risk. She also said she didn't like it because I'm named after my great grandmother, to which I say I don't care. She asked me why I wanted to change my name, and I told her its because I like Janus better and its (sort of) gender neutral compared to my birth name. Anyway, again it got heated, and we dropped it. I was expecting this, so I wasn't as crushed as I was the last time, although I did cry in my room for about 10 minutes. I was talking with my dad about being non-binary, and he mentioned that he was concerned that I was picking it up from the media (which does NOT help the fact that I feel like I'm faking being non-binary). The conversation went downhill. Then we all sit down for dinner, and my parents ask me what being non-binary feels like. I told them that it was not feeling like a girl or a boy, and so they asked what it felt like to be a girl or a boy. I DON'T KNOW! I'M NOT ONE! I said that (nicer), and they KEPT ASKING. They asked in different ways, and eventually I explained it was kind of a matter of how you see yourself, and things just kept spiraling down from there. 

So eventually I stormed off, extremely pissed, and my dad comes into my room to say sorry. I accept, and say that the biggest issue is the fact that my parents think this is their choice. My mom and dad literally said ""we'll have to think about it."" It is not their choice, its mine, and I said that. He said that they were still going to have to think about it. At this point my parents are starting to sound like a broken record, and I'm done, so I shoo him away, and now I'm here, pissed at my parents and ranting about it to the internet. When I came out, my mom said that she supported me. Now, my parents seem to not want me to be happy because some people will assume something about me because of the meaning of a name that isn't even the real meaning. Plus, when I'm 18 there is nothing stopping me from getting a legal name change anyway, so I don't know what is so great about not calling me Janus.

2020-12-15 00:54:12,kdb0ux,1,1,"So like, bear with me here because I'm kind of just figuring it all out myself. I'm 28 and transitioned from male to female originally.

Basically half a year ago I ""officially"" came out as NB although nothing really changed because I still use female pronouns and it's not like I'm going to force someone to use they/them for me; it's just preferable over he/him etc. It all just really felt like the most accurate way to describe how I see my gender, especially after legally/medically transitioning(SRS etc). Like dysphoria gone now I don't really have the obligation to keep trying to prove to myself/others that I'm a woman. My sex marker on my legal documents says F and physically that matches and past that I don't really care. So to kind of keep things sane in my life I just go with the female label because that's what fits and it's better than being called a man. 

I remember when I was first starting HRT that was literally the goal and it's something that I've thought about a lot. For a long time my gender identity hasn't even really been ""female"" it's just been ""not male"" and I always felt really outcast from other trans women bc of it. Like, I didn't even really feel I needed SRS, I just needed removal of a certain part and that my ideal genitals were just blank. That thought just gets me lately I suppose.

Like, growing up I remembered seeing the word ""androgyny"" on TV and it was mostly applied to people who went to raves, or goth girls and I didn't ever really understand it. But it's kind of the word that feels most at home to me lately and I almost wonder if that's specifically because I'm kind of older and ""non binary"" feels like a bit of a buzz word at times? I'd be afraid of the backlash if I told my coworkers I was NB but not so much if I just said I was androgynous. 

I think a lot of what I'm trying to get at here is that I'm really just confused. Part of me thinks that this ""non-binary"" thing is just my gender ""presentation"" and that deep down I am actually a woman although granted an androgynous one, especially since having a female sex is what's comfortable to me. Then there's the fact that I know that in a perfect world I'd be completely sexless and like the title says, just a person that exists.

2020-12-15 05:19:02,kdfibz,7,1,"Hey all,  


I'm nearly 40 and might want to get top surgery.  
I've strongly disliked my breasts ever since puberty. Luckily I'm on the small side, but I feel uncomfortable touching them in the shower and always try to flatten them as much as possible when I get dressed. I work with kids, and whenever a younger one calls me ""Mr."", I love it. It's not so much being identified as male that excites me, but rather the possibility that I don't immediately read as female to everyone. I've known for a long time that I'm bi, but it took me a while to realize that I've got a flat chest in my fantasies! And man, I think women look super hot after top surgery, no matter whether they're FTM or non-binary.   


Now ... I'm sure I'm not trans, but I feel a bit ridiculous suddenly identifying as non-binary when I'm practically middle-aged, lol. I've been around folks of all stripes my whole life, and have super supportive/ open-minded parents, so it seems somehow ... unlikely? ... that it took me this long. I recently opened up to my parents about my feelings, and was very relieved to hear that they were not surprised, let alone shocked. I guess I might be suffering from imposter syndrome though, and I'm not really sure how to get rid of it.   


Did anybody else here come to similar realizations at this, uh, comparatively advanced age? Photo to make this all a bit less anonymous.

2020-12-15 14:48:21,kdn0ow,2,1," I was lurking on the detrans subreddit for a while, but have just left and wanted to vent/share my experience with identity/going on and off T. I never subscribe to any trans-exclusionairy ideology, but I did refer to myself as a detransitioner, in the medical sense - and even socially, albeit only somewhat (stopped hrt, changed pronouns).

I was on T from mid 2017 until the end of 2019, and went off because of a bunch of reasons coinciding:

1. I  moved countries (Belgium to Germany) and didn't      have a job or an  endocrinologist, and since I struggle with social anxiety      and  needed a referral to get an endo, I kept putting it off.
2. I  had just moved out of my parents house, where I      had been abused by  my mom for as long as I can remember, and I was only      just coming  to terms with the fact that that happened
3. in  researching detransition I bumped into a lot    of statements about  the dangers of HRT, sometimes fair, but often      fearmongering. I had  always been researching many different views, because      I, due to my  anxiety, often feel like I can't make any definitive      statements on  things if I haven't ""fully"" acquainted myself with      the topic (I  studied philosophy, so think Chidi of the good place lol).      All of  this researching send my anxiety down a spiral of worry about my       physical health and I would get anxiety attacks thinking I was going to       die (and then attributed this feeling to testosterone- never mind  that I      had always had anxiety, I also suffer from tunnel vision and  bad time      perception)
4. In  my social anxiety I was constantly thinking      about gender, every  goddamn day and in every social interaction, so I      wanted to get rid  of this gendering disease and free myself of worry

After  1 year on T I can say: exchanging the worry about being perceived as a  woman for the want to be perceived as a woman is ridiculous. Especially  if I combine this with my dislike for a feminine gender presentation and  the inability to care for stuff like make-up (Im supposed to get up  every day and imprison myself in another little box?). Now I'm aware  that this is not what makes a woman or whatever, but to be fair, the  only ideological position I can fully get behind, especially now that  I've read up on theory is gender nihilism. Summed up: gender (either as a  binary, or including alternative gender identities) is a societal  construct (don't confuse this with the argument that it ""doesn't exist"",  the grouping of sex characteristics into “ideal states” (binary sex as  two categories, that we only ever encounter instances of) is of course also a construct, as it is a conceptualization made in a biological  framework, and (here comes the ethical add-on) this division of  individuals and the importance of this division on a societal level (as  opposed to a biological one) is harmful. However, we don’t just get to  scrap society and start over, and most importantly of all, I have been  socialized in this society, so I too can’t escape the existence of this  categorization (no matter how much I’d want it).

None  of this is a big revelation by the way, trans people and radical  feminists (the Marxist, trans inclusive type, like Judith Butler) have  been saying thing similar to this for fucking decades, it’s depressing  how often these arguments get misconstrued (especially by terfs).

So,  the theory out of the way, it felt nice to be on T, within this binary  society I would prefer to be trans over cis and added to this: I prefer living ""as a man"" to living ""as a woman"".

Not  to mention that I am at a point of masculinization that dressing the  way I want to, leads to people seeing me as a man more often than a  woman, so even without T it makes more sense.

One  important thing I “learned” being off T, is that I am no longer hurt by  anyone assuming anything about my gender, I use any pronouns and I’m  just vibing. I am also way calmer than I used to be, because I now know  that no matter what happens, my chest stays flat and my voice somewhat  deep and that makes me so comfortable in my skin.

It's my first time writing a post and using Reddit for more than reading so I hope I don't break any written or non-written reddit rule. (Also my native language is not English so you will find some mistakes around the post). 

I am writing this post because I don't have anyone to talk about it. I have been thinking a lot about my gender recently. I have always considered myself a woman because I didn't have enough information about being non-binary.  I have been out of the closet for almost 8 years (I came out when I was 20). I grow up in a very conservative environment and I struggled to understand that I was lesbian due to a lack of referents when I was a teenager. For some time I have been seeing more ad more non-binary people coming out and I started wondering. Recently, I saw one person I admire a lot, coming out as non-binary and getting top surgery to remove her chest (he didn't use gender-neutral pronouns, instead he goes by both pronouns he/she depending on the moment). That was a trigger for me to realize that I am non-binary. Also, I realized I wanted to try using a binder for my chest. I purchased one and I have been using it and t I love how my body looks with it (I have never felt very comfortable with my boobs). 

There is when the issue begins. My gf saw that I was going to buy the binder via amazon (we share the account) and she just asked me about it and I told her I wanted to try. She didn't say anything more. When it arrived I tried and I was really excited, I loved the way it looked so I send her a picture. She answered me: there are no boobs, with a sad face :(. I was really surprised because she is normally very comprehensive and sensible. I felt like shit and I also felt concerned because I started wondering if she still considers me attractive if I continue using the binder. So now I feel unable to talk to my gf about it but I also feel really good when I am using the binder and I plan to keep using it. In conclusion, this is not about using a binder, is about me feeling insecure coming out as non-binary especially with my gf.  

So, I would really appreciate it if someone would like to give me their advice or share their experience with me.

I’ve always thought of my gender as ‘female I guess.’ But lately I’ve been wondering if what I’ve been experiencing is body image issues or possibly a gender identity that doesn’t align with my assigned gender. 
I’ll get to the point, I don’t mind she/her pronouns but being called a woman makes me uncomfortable. Not sure what that’s about because words like lady or girl don’t bother me so much. I don’t like any of my secondary sex characteristics, some of them are neutral and others I totally hate. I feel the neutral about my body hair and my breast, which are really small so not sure how I’d feel if they were bigger. I also feel neutral about my mensuration, but it took me a while to not be very uncomfortable with the whole concept. The thing that makes me the most uncomfortable are my hips. Most of the time I can ignore them, but when I see the shape of my hips out of the blue, I get really uncomfortable. I wish they were narrow and it’s not like I have an hour glass figure but what ‘curves’ I do have I hate. 
I’ve always struggled with having long hair. I never wanted to deal with the upkeep and I thought it just looked bad on me. I cut my hair super short a year ago and I felt like my heart was about to burst. It was the only haircut I’ve ever had that made me feel authentically me. I dress androgynously for the most part. Some days I even like wearing dresses and makeup. Other days the thought of ‘feminine’ appearance feels tedious. 
One thing I do know is that I don’t want to be masculine. I thought briefly about what being a trans man, or even taking T, and I hated it even more. I almost wish I could just go back to my pre puberty body and keep my height.

2020-12-15 18:53:58,kdrtdy,3,1,"**TLDR:** Came out to my conservative Christian parents recently with expected response from them. Advice on setting boundaries and communicating with them appreciated.

To start, I am a 35yo Transfeminine/non-binary person. I live with my girlfriend and have a local support group and chosen family who have helped me get to a place where I felt it was both safe and due time to come out to my parents.

Shortly before Thanksgiving I finally mailed my five-page handwritten letter to my parents telling them I am transgender and non-binary.  It was worded carefully so as not to put them on the defensive or upset them more than this ""bombshell"" of information was already about too.  I poured my heart out to them, chose not to call them out on all the things that had hurt me and forced me deeper into the closet over the years, and really gave them a clean slate to start off with for getting to know the me that has always been there, hiding inside.

They texted when they received the letter, saying they needed time to process.  Valid, and I replied saying they should take their time.  Two weeks later I received a letter from them, typewritten, and only about 2/3 of a page.  It basically said, ""We love you, but God says you're wrong and we're praying for you to change"".  This is pretty much exactly how they responded to my brother coming out as gay years ago, so it's what I expected from them (still hurts).

The advice I'm asking for here is two-fold.  First, as I have pretty much zero experience setting boundaries with my parents; any advice to help me with that would be appreciated.  I'm not even sure what that looks like.  Second, how can I respond to their opinions and worldview given it is very conservative and Christian.

In a non-binary and binary relationship, you're not with the ""same gender"" and also not with the ""opposite gender"" since there's not just two. And you could say ""bi"", but you're not attracted to ""both men and women"".

It's been a little over a year since my last post so I thought I'd make a follow up! I opened up to my boyfriend about struggling with gender feelings shortly after that post. He's been very supportive and helpful in me dealing with my dysphoria, and even has been occasionally helping me while I browse new names. More recently I have started to accept more concretely that I am in fact nonbinary and have been trying out they/them in addition to he/him. I also came out to my mom two weeks ago when I went over to help with her holiday decorations and she reacted positively! She made a joke about how this time I have to pick my own name if I'm changing it again because she picked my last two lol

Also I'm no longer living in such an isolated space and have moved back to my hometown and have an apartment that I share with my two friends--a married pansexual couple who just got a small dog!

As far as treating dysphoria goes, my original doctor moved out of state but set me up with a new doctor that I get along with great! My last appointment we talked about how to approach my dysphoria issues, and I'm getting a referral for top surgery. We're also going to look into electrolysis for my facial hair and see how it works with keeping me on low doses of T. (If anyone has experience with that sort of hair removal while having testosterone as your dominant hormone or on testosterone HRT I'd love to hear about it)

Hi there, I met my girlfriend 8 years ago when I identified as a man. She was the seducer, I had resisted others, but her power of seduction and physique got me in the end. I tended to be rejecting and insulting to her, mostly this was because of her relationship with her boyfriend in college before she met me. She used her seduction of me to corrupt me.

I have since id-entified as a gender fluid lesbian female. I didnt take h-ormones or anything, so not much has changed physically, but my gender identity is more than my genitals. So anyway, I posted in other subs about another issue I had with her. Here I am focused on two different things. One how can I get her to agree to do a threesome with me and the mother of my first daughter? She says she is not lesbian, which I think is just a deliberate way to upset me, but clearly she is since I am lesbian and she is with me. Maybe I could just refuse to talk to her or give her any money for our daughter until she gives in? Secondly, she says she needs to leave home without me sometimes but I am not comfortable with this, I have a tracker on her phone already, but still she can just wait til I am ready to go out and we do it together right. She says it is controlling, and when she was in college she could go anywhere by herself - this is very worrying, why were her family allowing that? People have already told me from my other post that violence is never acceptable. One alternative is I could get her to do a hysterectomy in exchange for letting her go out more. She is young late 20s, so maybe this would make sure she didn't commit any sins when she is out of my supervision, and also it would be on the surgeon not me, but I am also worried it could negatively affect my sexual satisfaction in our relationship or also the surgeons would refuse to do it because she's still youngish.

So she is just trying to upset me, I am not the controlling one right, the seductress is just trying to turn the tables?

1. Do you agree I have every right to push my girlfriend into getting a hysterectomy? (But please, warn me if it will screw up our sex life so I lose enjoyment in the future).
2. Am I not right in controlling her movement, I'm only doing it to prevent the opportunity that she could stray.

I would be able to do make up

- I experienced chest dysphoria at a young age and was very uncomfortable with being a girl. I’m not uncomfortable anymore, but that’s just because I never think of my gender

- Before I even knew what nonbinary meant, I asked my partner if I looked like a girl (hoping they would say would say no or a mix between boy and girl; sometimes my preference depends on how I’m presenting)

- I don’t like being grouped in with girls (when I’m in a group and some refers to us as “that group of girls over there”). This makes me feel out of place. The word “woman” doesn’t feel right for me either

- Another instance with my partner, I explicitly said that I don’t feel like a girl or a boy, I just feel like me

I’m not uncomfortable anymore, but that’s just because I never think of my gender\n\n- Before I even knew what nonbinary meant, I asked my partner if I looked like a girl (hoping they would say would say no or a mix between boy and girl; sometimes my preference depends on how I’m presenting)\n\n- I don’t like being grouped in with girls (when I’m in a group and some refers to us as “that group of girls over there”). This makes me feel out of place. The word “woman” doesn’t feel right for me either\n\n- Another instance with my partner, I explicitly said that I don’t feel like a girl or a boy, I just feel like me\n\n\nAnd yeah, that pretty much sums it up, I just feel like me.

I’ve been dating my partner (18NB) for over a year now and recently I really messed up, I need help fixing this please and I don’t know who to ask or where to go. 

They’ve been struggling w their gender for awhile (like  a month or so of serious questioning) wondering if they might be fully Trans Male, wondering if they want to present more masc. etc. they’ve identified as non-binary since before I even met them and the Idea of them though- almost 3 years. 

Recently though, with them thinking they might be a trans guy, they started to like vent to me about this and just talking about their gender kind of negatively (there were a couple like panic breakdowns they had where they were talking about their gender and not wanting to get dressed) I gave them the advice of “just figure out who you want to be and how much you actually care about labels” and they said that actually helped.

But while this was happening, I was kind of freaking out. If they transition, how will I support them? What if my attraction to their current body means that I can’t find those same things attractive without causing them dysphoria post-transition? What if I find it harder to be attracted to men? I’m bisexual but I’ve never actually dated a man and that really scares me that I won’t know what to do. 

So while I’m freaking out about this, since I have nobody to ask- I ask them. And I basically asked this at the worst time. I freaked out about all this in a bunch of long texts after they made it clear they were having a gender moment (they were wearing a mascara mustache, I actually thought it looked really cool, I didn’t really consider that they could’ve also been freaking out ) 

In response to this, they basically told me what is obvious to me now- definitely not the right time to ask that, should’ve phrased it better, and I should be attracted to them no matter what and it’s not my decision. 

I’m worried that I’ll lose them, and I don’t care what label they have. But I’m also worried that I won’t know how to support them during/after a hypothetical transition, that I won’t know how to interact in a healthy way if they start identifying as male, etc. 

Since then we’ve talked about this but their attitude towards me hasn’t really changed. They don’t seem to want to talk to me, and I’m really starting to think they’re about to break up with me.

I'll start from the beginning, 2 years ago I was 100% confident that i was a straight male.

But recently I've discovered my fem side. I love pink, i wanna be able to wear skirts and Makeup, paint my nails, and wear thigh highs. I love fashion and hair, etc etc. But I also like masc stuff.

Then I told my lgbtq+ friends, 2 cis gay guys and 2 cis lesbians. They all laughed at me, telling me that I dont look good enough to be enby, I'm too masculine to be enby, that I cant be enby and have facial hair, I cant be enby because I dress like a guy and more. By this time I was crying and left.

A couple hours later, when I calmed down, I posted my selfie, and it kind of exploded with support and love. And it was because of that you guys saved my life. I wanted to say thank you to everyone.

2020-12-16 08:33:26,ke5ibf,0,1,"In my dream I was at a mall, somewhere that doesn't exist outside the dream world. I was with my ex husband and our kids, on some sort of day trip or something. 

A part of the mall was a gym with all sorts of things to do, from the usual exercise machines and free weights to an area for aerial acrobatics. At another part, there was a home improvement store. They had some sort of an event for men, mostly fathers and sons, where you could try all kinds of tools an try to craft something or just experiment. My ex and the kids wanted to go, and I would have liked it too, but didn't feel comfortable there. I would have been welcome and nobody would bat an eye but I felt out of place.

At the same time the gym had a ""ladies only"" event. I went to see, but again felt out of place. There was all kinds of people there, all doing whatever they loved, no matter how ""feminine"" or ""masculine"" the society sees things. Again, I would have been welcome there and I could see some clearly masc presenting people, but I still didn't feel like I should be there.

My brain was quite obviously making an effort to process my real life gender dysphoria, here. I have been thinking how out of place I feel when I'm out with the kids doing something we all like and I notice most other kids are with their fathers. No one ever says anything or even looks at us badly, it's all in my head. But I still feel like I'm intruding or something.

It's not only the gender dysphoria, I also have general issues with feeling like an outsider anywhere I go, and don't like trying new things in public. But it definitely does play a part. It's rare to see any venue or event that explicitly welcomes non-binary (or other than binary gendered) people.

i’ve always been a tomboy since i was little. femininity was forced on me (not as hard as some people but it still was) and because of that it disgusts me. i came out as a lesbian when i was like 12 and my family was very accepting. my family isn’t the issue btw my older brother is gay and my younger sister is trans mtf. anyway i’m a lesbian and although i came out so young it was a hard thing to fully come to terms with and part of me feels like coming out as non-binary will diminish the lesbian in me. 

can i be a nonbinary lesbian? i don’t fully understand she/they pronouns but i feel like that’s what i would choose (i don’t understand a lot of this): 

sometimes i feel like i could be feminine but only in private, wearing ‘femme’ clothes like dresses or skirts or makeup outside of my room literally makes me gag like i’m lying to people? sorta?? i don’t think i really have dysphoria (but idk if i’d know if i did...)? im pretty curvy, i love my ass, i like my boobs but they rly get in the way of looking how i want, and i hate my hips for that reason. i don’t think i would ever want a penis lol but i just wish my body was more ‘masculine.’ like if i could just get all the male hormones and work my body out to look the way i want it to i think that’d be great. 

but anyway what the fuck is my gender. i’m not opposed to new pronouns necessarily but i don’t see how only changing my pronouns would really help me ya know? another issue is my girlfriend. she’d totally be fine w whoever i am but it comes back to the whole lesbian thing. we are a lesbian couple, we are girlfriends, and that doesn’t make me uncomfortable but what does is thinking that if i come out to her as nonbinary we’d have to change our labels and couldn’t be girlfriends anymore.

i am and have always been super attached to my family. i have two younger brothers, a dog, and a mom and i love them all so much. 

however, they aren't super open to ""new ways"" of thinking. my mom is pretty progressive usually but we've had some uncomfortable conversations about pronouns and gender and such. and my brothers are young enough that they couldn't really give a shit. 

just last night i was trying to teach my youngest brother (11) that we can't assume someone's gender based off of how they look because enby people owe absolutely no one androgyny, masculinity, or femininity. my mom got kind of uncomfortable and after he went upstairs, she confronted me and basically said something along the lines of, ""(deadname), he's only 11! i don't think it's fair to confuse him like that!"" 

my response was, ""if we don't teach them, who's going to?"" 

we talked (argued) for a little longer and at one point she said something like, ""i just find it frustrating that i can't see a person that looks like a girl and say 'she'"". 

obviously, that is problematic on so many levels and i made sure to tell her that. but she's been annoyed at me since that conversation and i'm really conflicted because she has no idea i'm genderqueer or what my name is and i don't know how i'm ever going to tell her if she keeps thinking like this. usually my mom is one of my best friends but i can't think about ""coming out"" to her without feeling sick to my stomach. 

i know you can't pick and choose parts of a person but do you guys have any advice for how to make it easier to tell her that all genders are valid no matter how she feels about it?

So many people have started specifying their pronouns on zoom or in email signatures - and I've hesitated - because I wasn't really ""out,"" but I could not bring myself to put the wrong pronouns after my name.

This time - it's more in your face. I wasn't sure how I would feel about it. All I know is that I really have never liked when people use my assumed assigned at birth gender pronouns. It's always felt cringy, but I've always been too afraid to ask that people use the ones I like. I don't want to make anyone feel awkward (I know,  I know, I don't have to apologize for my pronouns - but it's hard to deprogram this feeling).  I haven't made it clear before is because of this - because I worry about other people's reactions/experience, but also because I constantly question myself (am I just faking it?)

So, long story short, I’m AFAB and have been generally fine with my gender being female. However, I began to realize a few months ago that being entirely female didn’t fit me much anymore. I identified as a demigirl and have for a bit now, but I now realize that even that doesn’t feel entirely right. 

Here’s the thing- I’m fine with having a feminine figure and presenting female, but I’d like to use they/them pronouns and I’m in the process of choosing a new name. I feel like nonbinary as a label fits me a bit better than demigirl. Can I still be nonbinary without experiencing dysphoria? And can I still present as one gender while using neutral pronouns? 

In addition, part of me is worried I’m faking it. I have several AFAB friends that came out as nonbinary recently and they sort of spurned my questioning of my own gender. I had a conversation with a parent about them and my parent was like “they just don’t know what it’s like to be a real woman yet.” So I feel kind of invalid, idiotic, or like I’m following a trend.

So yeah, this sucks. The good news is that I now know about this condition and can make better medical decisions for myself moving forward.

2020-12-17 14:06:00,key1hj,6,1,"  Last night I had the first dream I could ever remember having of actually being a woman. 37 years living as a masc man And ya, Ive fantasized about it. But never have I ever actually had a somewhat lucid dream having a female figure. Of being treated like a woman. I was feeling so good about it. Long hair and a beautiful body. I was so f****** happy!!
   But of course it all gets ripped away by my stupid real body. As I sat on the toilet to use the bathroom with my female genitals for the first time of course We all know what happens in those dreams. So I wake up in a puddle of my own piss. Soaking the entire bed and waking up my wife at 3:00 in the morning humiliated. I couldn't even sleep in the bed next to her and hold her because of the mess. I had to go shower and of course I balled my eyes out silently on the dark. I tried to sleep on the couch alone and there's no f****** sleeping after that. Wtf . I'm sure it's just a coincidence that the first time in my adult life that I'd ever pissed myself is the first time in my life that I'd ever dream of being a woman. Right!? 

I know that it's pretty common to wet the bed if you have a peeing dream. But holy crap am I in a bad way because of it. I could really use some love. I'm trapped at home during a snowstorm in the quarantine while my wife left for work early this morning. She was very kind but as usual in the morning very focused on her own stressors. She reassured me that it's perfectly normal to wet the bed sometimes and that was helpful. But I don't think she has any clue as to how much it affects me. I don't think she knows the joy I had ripped out of my mind.  Now I get to sit around all day processing this.

We all know that in most western cultures (I speak specifically from the perspective of an American), AFABs are given more freedom in terms of gender expression. That's partly a result of many generations of convention-defying feminists, but these days, it's pretty much an automatic privilege that AFABs can experiment with their presentation without as much criticism. Even growing up in a seriously Catholic environment, my masculinity as an AFAB was never strongly condemned. I could and did accept clothing from the boy next door and happily cross-dressed as much as I pleased. Sometimes my parents were uncomfortable about it, but they automatically considered it my right to expression myself in the manner I chose.

But my younger brother wants to experiment with his presentation, too, and he isn't given an inch of freedom to explore femininity. I gave him a unisex flannel out of my closet, and he was *so* excited about it. But our mom promptly made him get rid of it because ""look this crease is feminine."" I'm not even allowed to share my male clothing with him because ""if a female wears it, it's a girl's shirt."" Meanwhile, I'm allowed to take all of his cast-off clothing without a problem. It sucks, because I've seen how excited he is about some things, like painting his nails or dying his hair - and he isn't allowed to do any of it.

I'm not sure how to help him, really. It isn't safe to push him to challenge our parents' boundaries, but I can't imagine how awful I'd feel if I was forced to wear dresses and skirts exclusively.

I\'m not even allowed to share my male clothing with him because ""if a female wears it, it\'s a girl\'s shirt."" Meanwhile, I\'m allowed to take all of his cast-off clothing without a problem. It sucks, because I\'ve seen how excited he is about some things, like painting his nails or dying his hair - and he isn\'t allowed to do any of it.\n\nI\'m not sure how to help him, really. It isn\'t safe to push him to challenge our parents\' boundaries, but I can\'t imagine how awful I\'d feel if I was forced to wear dresses and skirts exclusively. As much as I sometimes wish I was AMAB, I feel that I really need to acknowledge how lucky I am to have more freedom of expression when it comes to my gender presentation.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'AFAB privilege in the nonbinary community', 'created': 1608249177.0}"

I’m AFAB and recently realized I’m 95% sure I’m not cis. My gender presentation is generally masculine, but there are occasions where I enjoy presenting a bit more feminine, i.e. wearing a dress or makeup. How I act is typically kind of right in the middle erring on the side of masculinity. I’m trying to see what label suits me - genderqueer seems ok but a bit more vague than I’d like. Genderfluid doesn’t seem right because it’s my presentation that changes on occasion, and I don’t feel like a different gender when that happens. I just feel like me. If it matters, I’m still using she/her pronouns but am considering she/they - it still kinda scares me so I haven’t changed anything yet. Also partly because there is an area of my life that I can’t be out in and can’t leave for some time. I don’t really feel like a “woman”, but I don’t feel like a man either. I get a lot of joy when someone accidentally calls me “sir” or “man” in public, and sometimes feel a bit annoyed when I’m called “miss” but usually don’t mind much.

I was wondering what words you all use to describe yourselves in relation to other people?

My brother and I were trying to find an alternate to sister/brother and he came up with ""struther"" which very quickly morphed into ""shrubber"" and now I am officially a shrubber. (My name is Roger the shrubber. I arrange, design and sell shrubberies)

I'm also trying to come up with a better word than aunty/uncle. So far I have ankle (auncle). It needs work but I think it also follows in the proud tradition of non binary folks being called random nouns.

2020-12-17 23:10:55,kf8oa4,24,3,"Hello! So I have been doing a lot of thinking lately and I need your opinions on this.

So a little about me: I'm 26, and I was assigned male at birth.  I was raised as a man and up until very recently I described myself as a cishetero man. However, after reading up on non binary and what it means, I feel like I identify with nonbinary more than cisgender. For one, the entire labeling of ""man"" and ""woman"" seems wrong to me, mainly because of the social repercussions and how the world views and expects of you when you adhere to just ""man"" or ""woman"".

Now, I am not gay, I am forsure heterosexual, I am strictly attracted to women and that's a for sure. But growing up, I always felt like ""one of the girls"". I had mostly women in my family, and so much of my childhood was spent shopping and gossiping with my girl cousins, even though I like sports and cars, I love Disney and singing and music, and I dont necessarily equate those things with certain genders. Ive had many cishetero guy friends and Ive never felt a real connection to that. Like, hanging out with cishetero guys, theyll always say shit like ""I respect gay people, but I dont like super gay people"" and that pisses me off, like I cant connect with that because I feel like theyre just not on the same level when it comes to understanding that. I feel like I dont connect with cishetero guys because the way they view sex, romance, the LGBTA+ community, etc. is just way different. Its not necessarily a hate thing, I just feel like they don't understand it. 

Hanging out with girls feels natural with me, and even when my one friend Teri calls me ""her girlfriend"" or ""one of the girls"" it honestly makes me feel really good. Like almost like ""aha, you get it!"" Even though I would identify myself as a cishetero man. Many many days I feel like everything about me, my actions, thoughts, and mannerisms, is best explained with ""yeah, you're just a lesbian"". Ever since I realized nonbinary wasnt just trans I feel like this aligns with how I feel about myself way better than being cisgender.

However, what I really dont want to do is marginalize the struggles of gay/bi/trans men/women/nonbinaries that have to go with the actual threats of violence, the stigma and pain of sex changes, because at the end of the day, I was assigned male at birth, grew up my whole life calling myself a man, and is attracted soley to women. However, I do not feel this innate pull to ""be a man"" or ""prove my masculinity to myself"" in any way. I would identify as either he/him or they/them, but I also feel like calling me she/her would be reserved for the close people in my life that actually understands me. I dont enjoy people calling me a woman if they dont know and understand me, because I feel like they're just either trying to queerbait me or calling me a woman for the sole reason of trying to piss me off, its not being called a woman I hate, its the idea that you're just being a deuchebag and saying it like you know me and are being a huge dickhole about it all.

Honestly, Ive been identifying cishetero all this time because I felt like I didnt want to claim a label when other people literally struggle from it- at the end of the day I feel like other people see me as a guy attracted to girls and as a result, I do get benefits from being viewed as a cishetero man, albeit one who wears skinny jeans. I always prided myself in thinking I was a cishetero man who liked Disney and singing and fully appreciated and supported the LGBTA+ community. I wanted to break the mold of what a cishetero man could be.

The more and more I think about it though, I feel like nonbinary just feels correct. It feels absolutely right. I feel like maybe I have such a strong sense to ally with the LGBTA+ community because Im in it? Im really confused because I dont want to claim something just because I feel its right; I want to make sure it's right before I claim it.

They're just so damn comfy)",NonBinary,"This feels right, but IDK if I can claim it.

2020-12-18 05:48:46,kffatz,3,1,"Hey everyone! I'm just writing my current thoughts out with this post and would love any advice anyone can give, thanks so much ^^

I've been considering the concept of gender recently and feel like I might not be cis, but not sure, I currently don't label either my sexuality or gender.

I am biologically female and grew up a girl, however on looking back I've always hated the term 'lady' and if anyone ever called me it I would rebut with 'I'm not a lady'. I hated the colour pink since it was considered girly, hated wearing dresses, and was proud to consider myself a tomboy. I disliked when people called me by a feminine form of my name, and went with ambiguous nicknames. A lot of the typical 'I'm not like other girls' stuff haha. I've also recently attributed a lot of this to most likely lesbian traits as I realised I'm probably only attracted to women (I never knew stereotypes were actually a thing!). Although I've never been entirely comfortable being called a woman, girl - yes, but not woman. I've never had an issue with she/her pronouns, and always wanted to grow my hair long. I stopped shaving and wearing make up years ago, only went with it as a young teen because of society and I've never been one for abiding by societal rules so quickly gave up with that. I grew up rurally (not America) and so never knew much about LGBT+ when I was in primary school, considered myself potentially not straight in high school but also felt like I was faking it, and have been learning so much more after moving away from home and to a capital city, which is how I learnt about actual attraction, and now about gender but it's harder to find information. 

Now here's the thing: I've recently cut my hair real short, which I love, and confused small children with the 'are you a girl or a boy', which I love messing with conformity. I am intrigued by they/them pronouns, but not comfortable maybe exploring yet, and not too worried about pronouns anyway, don't have a preference. However, I've been looking up nb identities, and they all talk about man/masculine genders and women/female genders, but what is gender? It's entirely made up and so I don't understand how to explore it. The only identifier I can think of is the pronouns used, otherwise anyone can be anything they want. We only have stereotypes which are bs anyway. I don't really care about pronouns, so how are you meant to explore gender when it's not actually a thing as I see it? Like, it's a thing but not a thing and I'm confused. 

In conclusion, I'd love advice or experience from people who've questioned before and how you figured/are figuring yourself out and what you consider gender to be :)",NonBinary,"Advice wanted about gender, mildly long",1608295726.0,"{'created_utc': 1608270526, 'id': 'kffatz', 'num_comments': 3, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""Hey everyone!

2020-12-18 06:23:56,kffs94,6,4,"Hey r/Nonbinary!
I’m struggling a little bit with something and I’m hoping to see if anyone has any advice.

I started T back in May and had top surgery back in September. My body is finally starting to look right and my voice finally seems to be dropping. 

Something I’ve noticed though is that now that all this is happening, my taste in clothing is becoming more experimental and even fem leaning androgynous. 

I think most of my dysphoria is centered on things about my body. The shape of it, my voice, bottom dysphoria, etc. They’re all overwhelmingly awful at times. My social dysphoria is pretty bad too, being seen as a girl is crushing. But it feels like I’m ready to experiment a little more. I’ve been trying out wearing skirts in a kind of androgynous, goth-y high fashion sort of way. Capes. Open shirts and shirts with lots of ruffles. Those sorts of things. Haven’t worn them out of the house yet though. 

It’s only just the sort of clothing that feels best to me a lot of the time now though, and I’m worried what people will think. I’m scared of people thinking I’m a “trender” or that dressing like this could mean I’ll be perceived as a girl forever, even while medically transitioning. I’m worried that friends and family will think I changed my mind, but it feels more like what’s happening was that before I had to play up masculinity so much aesthetically to look androgynous but now it feels like I want to have fun with my aesthetic and can aim to pass (or confuse people! That’s always fun) due to my body, voice eventually hopefully, mannerisms, etc. Wearing skirts and such feels like crossdressing to me, but other people probably wouldn’t think that just yet. 

I also feel a lot more confident calling agender now. t feels best when strangers perceive me as a man and use he pronouns, but ultimately beyond being transmasc and needing people to see me as male, I don’t really feel any sense of gender at all. Basically, genderless void person lmao. 

So I guess this is a case of fear and even dysphoria dysphoria? Fear of people discounting how bad my dysphoria is because it hurts to have something that’s so often debilitating treated as a nonissue. I don’t know. Anyone have any advice with trying to just stop caring so much?",NonBinary,"Transitioning, presentation changes and getting over the fear of being a labelled a trender",1608297836.0,"{'created_utc': 1608272636, 'id': 'kffs94', 'num_comments': 6, 'score': 4, 'selftext': 'Hey r/Nonbinary!\nI’m struggling a little bit with something and I’m hoping to see if anyone has any advice.\n\nI started T back in May and had top surgery back in September.

2020-12-18 20:15:19,kfsq60,2,1,"[CW: Mention of transphobic violence (non-descriptive), discussion of gender dysphoria]

How do you navigate the world of beauty, skincare, and haircare as a nonbinary person?

I’ve noticed a recent trend in beauty: a variety of new products being marketed as unisex, gender-neutral, androgynous, etc. While I do believe that this is mostly an attempt to capitalize on the recent growing ambivalence towards heavily gendered marketing (and gender roles in general), some brands like Fluide and especially smaller, more indie beauty brands are coming out with some intriguing stuff. Hell, CK One was marketed as unisex in the 90s, and we’ve come a long way since then.

I think it’s interesting that this is happening at the same time the overall beauty world is leaning more and more heavily into natural, dewy, minimalistic makeup looks. The caking and baking of the 2010s is being phased out by Korean-influenced dewy skincare routines, BB creams, and a greater emphasis on natural hair and skin. 

As someone who has always feared and loathed products like foundation and concealer, this is pretty exciting. Shade matching is fucking hard, tbh, and I’m a white person! I can’t even imagine the shit BIPOC go through to find products that work for their bodies, and I’m thankful the overall beauty conversation is starting to reflect that.

There’s also a lot of discourse around androgyny itself. Often, “androgynous” is synonymous with a masculine silhouette broken up with feminine touches - a woman in a suit, maybe with a buzz cut and lipstick, or a man wearing eyeliner and nail polish.

Nonbinary people who present as their AGAB are “just women/men who want to feel different” or “not nonbinary enough,” but gender-nonconforming (GNC) folks are at risk for transphobic violence, especially AMAB people.

With all this in mind and against the background of an increasingly consumerist society, do you see things like gender-neutral marketing/products as a short-lived fad or as the future? Is it a genuine attempt at inclusion or a cynical cash-grab? Even if we DO see it as a marketing tactic, has it helped anyone survive a bad dysphoria day or feel more in control of their gender presentation?

How is your experience as a nonbinary person reflected in your aesthetic choices? In your makeup, skincare, hair, and clothes? Do you dress to fit in or to stand out? How do you dress at work vs. at home, with strangers vs. with friends? Does dysphoria play a part in your choices, and what sort of things make you feel euphoric?

My background: I’m R, a nonbinary person. AFAB, and my mom never wore makeup, so I had no experience at all with it until much later. I presented femme in university, but when I started exploring my identity, I found that putting on makeup was contributing heavily to my gender dysphoria.

Recently, I’ve started playing with makeup again, but it’s difficult to find looks that don’t cause major dysphoria. I believe that hearing the experiences of others navigating the worlds of beauty and style is important for all of us.

Pretty pink petals swirling gently onto silk and cotton,
A perfect compliment, I am told,
To the feathery sweetness of my voice

I am soft and delicate,
Fragile in my daintiness,
To be admired with caution
And not handled too harshly,

But I am also the stalk bursting erect through the concrete,
The roots winding themselves into the soil,
Every bit as much the dirt I thrive in as the petals I bloom out, 
Every bit the wildflowers on the side of the interstate as I am the showroom rose, 
Every bit as feral as refined;

Is a synonym for “feminine”
Because flowers do not see themselves that way; 
A flower does not concern itself
With being a “man” or a “woman”;
(Most flowers are botanically male and female,
But even those who aren’t 
Aren’t concerned with the labels of a human tongue);

2020-12-18 21:39:26,kfua6n,4,1,"Hi! I'm just looking for some support and some kind words, I guess. 

I (24) am in this in-between place in my entire exploration where I am out to some people, but not to others. I've come out in May to the people who were most important to me at the time: My parents and siblings, one friend and many online friends and contacts. Online everyone has been great. My friend does not really understand but is willing to support me wherever she can. My parents however, they responded mostly dismissive and confused. This was in may, when I told them that I would be exploring a new name and pronouns with my (online) friends first. They responded so negatively to this idea however, that since then I've never dared to bring it up to them again. 

So now I'm slowly building my new identity and self, but I feel like I'm leaving my parents and siblings behind. I'm too scared to ask them to use the right name and pronouns right now, because I would not be able to deal with them responding negatively to it. It is better not to ask than to be turned down. 

Similarly, I have not started introducing myself with my new pronouns yet, and have stopped coming out to more people. I know that it will be a struggle once I do, and I need to be strong to confront any negative responses or ignorance that I will encounter. And I am feeling less strong than ever at the moment. 

What I'm trying to say is that I am feeling lonely and out of place through this whole process. I almost wish that I never started it in the first place. I am on a waiting list for gender therapy but you know.. waiting lists.

2020-12-18 22:11:00,kfuw1m,2,1,"I've seen a lot of these, but I could use some advice for my situation. 

TLDR: how do I tell 25 new coworkers about my pronouns

So I just started a new job, and I'm really bad about informing new people about my pronouns. My last job I had a really transphobic coworker that asked me invasive personal questions and I was misgendered by everyone on my team. Only one person actually tried, and probably only got it right 5 times. It was my first time being out at work so now I'm hesitant about it for my new job. 

My new team has about 25 coworkers between the ages of 20 and 30, with my supervisors being a bit older. On my first day, they automatically assigned me she/her pronouns (probably bc of my voice), except at the very end of my shift one person said to me ""btw if you use different pronouns let us know"" and as the awkward human I am I said ""yeah I use they/them pronouns but I'm not gonna shove it down peoples throats"" (why am I like this). They told me that every one on the team is chill but i needed to tell people for them to understand. And I immediately changed the subject feeling awkward. So at least I know I have one ally that probably read me as trans. 

Anyways, I probably will work with 3 to 5 of them a day, and I'd honestly rather tell a few people that understand and have them share with the rest of the team instead of making a big announcement. I don't correct people when they misgender me and it hurts even more when I've told them. And I hate when people mess up and then apologize until I say something. Like I'd rather they just pick one and stick to it.

I also work at a facility that requires changing into a wetsuit in a locker room and theres only two locker rooms (male/female) so I'm afraid everyone will associate my gender based on what locker room I pick and my wetsuit will increase my curves so I can't present more masculine with my own clothes. 

I need help on what I should say/how to say it to people and when, especially with my older supervisors bc I'm honestly a bit afraid of them lol.

But the problem is, I'm not certain about where to even begin explaining nonbinary to my cishet parents who grew up with nothing but the gender binary.

I guess every enby has their own experience, but if anyone has some resources or tips that have helped when they've come out to people, I would really appreciate it. I think a big part of it is just ripping off the bandaid. If I wanna do it, I just gotta do it. But naturally I'm nervous and it hurts when people deny my identity and deny the fact that I exist.

2020-12-19 13:25:42,kg7o42,1,1,"Hi everyone. I hope this kind of post is ok to put here. I'm looking for any words of support/wisdom/clarity and also just using this as a way to work through everything in my head.

A quick timeline and bit of context: I'm 35 and have always identified as a gay cis woman. I came out at 14. I was a tomboy as a child and my friends were almost exclusively all male. I felt very 'boy' as a kid. I messed around a bit with gender identity when I was in my late teens/early 20s when I discovered the freedom of moving to a big city. I enjoyed looking androgynous and having a tall, slim frame (oh to have that body again!) As I've got a bit older I've kind of just drifted into this version of myself that I've been comfortable in for a while but recently have started to dislike. I feel like I look like a frumpy, edging-towards-middle-age woman with a bland, functional sense of fashion. It's harder for me to keep trim now - because 35 year old cis woman body - and this has really shaped how I see myself and what I've allowed myself to feel in terms of my gender identity.

In recent years I've thought a lot about how I can't seem to see any role models of what I want to look like as a woman. I've never wanted to identify as butch - that label to me just doesn't fit right as it feels too masculine for how I feel. But 'butch' was kind of the only term I could use to get style inspiration. Other labels like 'hard femme', 'boi', 'tomboy' just don't feel right either, although I cherry pick from these too when trying to look for people's style that I like. When I think about why these labels don't work for me I can see that the answer has been there all along. I've never identified with the word 'woman', even in the context of these non-cisnormative labels. I don't feel like a woman, and I don't really have a sense of womanhood. When I think about women as the group I'm sexually attracted to, I don't see myself as part of that group...if that makes sense? Like, there's women and then there's me. I have thought about whether I might be trans but that also doesn't sit right with me. I don't feel a need to commit to being male, I don't want to present as male. Or rather, I do, but not necessarily all the time. I have always felt like I'm neither female nor male, or maybe it's more accurate to say I feel I'm a mix of both. 

If I may get personal for a bit...I don't have any connection to my vagina or breasts other than they're a part of my body that makes me feel good. I don't have a sense of womanhood connected to them. But I don't hate them or feel repulsed by them either - they just...are what they are. I have never liked or wanted to be penetrated, and I've always wanted to take the dominant role in bed. I only like feeling masculine in bed; I need to be the strong, powerful top and my ideal partner is a femme bottom who likes being dominated with a strap. I think all of this is part of what made me question whether I might be trans.

Anyhow, I've been looking around this sub today and doing some reading online and I think that non-binary is an accurate description of how I feel. It feels quite free as a label and lets me have this fluidity with my sense of self. Some days I wanna look like Donna Tartt, some days I wanna look like (or at least feel that I look like) [Richey Edwards](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/e8/65/29/e8652985419d39464ce7d8961e93e663.jpg). In fact, looking like a pretty rock boy is kind of my favourite look. I'm not sure I want to use 'they/them' pronouns but yeah, the term non-binary definitely seems to match how I feel inside.

Does any of this resonate with anyone else here? Any older folks on here who have similar stories? I'm sorry if any of this is problematic or I've used the wrong terminology for anything. I'm new to all this and I mean no disrespect or hurt to anyone. Please just correct me about anything and I'll fix it.

Sadly, currently I'm v much a soft boi, however when I finally get that sweet top surgery and work on my voice, I plan on trolling people that have invasive questions about my body. So, I'll share some stuff that you can take as suggestions when someone asks you something invasive

1.Just start talking about scientology. You can read up on it on wikipedia just in case. I picked this one because it's still one of the religions regular people see as silly and weird(I don't really have an opinion on it but let's face it: it's kind of a joke to a lot of the human race) but not unbelievable enough for you to practice it. Also, nobody knows a lot about it,which gives you some ""creative freedom"" with your replies, so when you put enough confidence into your act? You're golden, fam. If someone still asks you ""Yeah but are you a boy or a girl"" after you say you're enby, say you're a strong believer in the teaching of Lord Xenu, if they start trying to get ""info"" out of you? Make something up about how you're whatever Lord Xenu wants, how Lord Xenu doesn't believe in bathrooms and so on.

2.Someone asks you: ""Hey so which bathroom do you go to""? You could say you don't go to bathrooms because you don't trust them and wear a diaper at all times(nothing wrong with that but I feel like it's unusual enough to weird a so called ""normie"" out)

3. Another thing: when they ask questions or state anything in general, answer with either asking them the same question or turning their sentence inro a question. So, example: they ask the ""Yeah but are you a boy or a girl"" you reply ""Are you a boy or a girl?"" ""I'm a girl!"" ""Yeah, but are you a girl?"" just keep on doing this and watch them rage

Small note: please don't do say any of these if they might put you in danger

I may make edits, your suggestions will be pretty useful for the future, feel free to discuss

That, and I have some more specific questions about being non-binary.

Can I still use he/him as the primary set of pronouns I use? I like they/them but I don't think I could brain-train myself to correct someone if they used the wrong pronouns, nor do I take notice when someone uses he/him. For example, I wouldn't bat an eye if someone used he/him but would notice and like it if someone used they/them. Is that a thing that happens?

I like feminine and androgynous looks, but I also like wearing what I am now (stereotypical male teenager clothing) and it kinda depends on the day. That's okay too, right?

also, this is my first time using reddit so sorry if i did anything wrong :\[

anyway, i started questioning if i was nonbinary some months ago, i’ve never really felt like i fit in with girls? that might be because i’m autistic and go to a school full of autistic boys, idk. my boobs also bother me but not a lot, like i wish they weren’t there but i can live with them. i actually started binding some weeks ago and i really love how i look with no boobs, makes me happy. my long hair also bothers me a lot, i wish i had shorter hair but my mom won’t let me get it cut short, she says i’ll look like a ball if i got short hair again.

i wish when people look at me they won’t know what gender i am, i want people to look at me and go ????. actually, a small boy some years ago once called me a boy and i internally lost my shit, it felt great.

i also hate it when people call me “young lady” like i’m not a young lady!! i’m a bastard bitch!!! i also just hate being called women/lady, i’m fine with girl/sister but i think i would prefer something gender-neutral, but i don’t really know, people always use feminine terms for me

i’ve been considering going by “mob” for a week now, but that’s probably just because i really like mob psycho 100 right now

i also tend to headcanon characters i relate to as nonbinary/trans? idk if that says anything about my gender but thought i should mention it lol

Although I should feel very happy about myself, I have been feeling more suicidal than ever because of the way I have been treated by various people. My parents are very conservative and are Christians. They are mostly nice to me but gender and sexuality is a red flag for them. One time I got into a heated argument and my dad yelled, ""YOUR FUCKED UP!!! IF YOU DONT IDENTIFY WITH YOUR SEX THAN YOUR FUCKED UP!!!!"" I have other relatives who are more accepting but I usually only see them on the holidays. 

I have a psychiatrist who tells me that im confused. She thinks that trans and gay people can view themselves clearly because they either feel male or female and are attracted to guys or girls. She tells me that bi, ace, and nonbinary people are confused. It doesn't help that the medicines she give me barely do anything. They worked in the past, but like any medication I took they eventually stopped working on me. There is a therapist she works with that has experience working with LGBTQ patients, but for unknown reasons he thinks he doesn't match for my needs and refuses to have appointments with me. 

Than there is my job. I work at retail and I'm very open to talk about how I'm nonbinsry. When misgendered I calmly explain that im nonbinary and usually customers are friendly and willing to learn about it, but after a while it gets very annoying. Especially when the customer is an older person. I find that boomers and the elderly tend to be more stubborn about these things. But at the same time I cannot blame them. I have to wear a mask so I can't really put makeup on. On top of that my parents wouldn't let me do it anyway.

my school is very transphobic and my parents claim to support me but berate me if i ever correct them and never make an effort to use my pronouns or name or anything and they even critise me for wearing rainbows and my flag and showing my gender in public because 'the lgbtq want to be normal, why do they stand out and claim their oppressed when they show everyone their gender like a new item?'. in my school i was forced to do a term on feminism and it made me so insecure and i go to an all girls school so they use ""ladies"" and ""miss"" and ""girls"" and i should ignore it but it feels like a punch to the gut after being told im not valid.

i tried to tell my form tutor (a teacher) and they said that maybe when i was older they'd consider it and i was too young and unless i change my name legally they cant change it, they allow nicknames even stupid ones but not preferred names and im sick of this.

the only good thing is my classmates and friends are starting to use my name and not say it was a mistake when corrected but actually say 'no, just one person' but it doesnt help when your own family doesn't accept you.

Here is my story....  


I have always been relatively happy with being female. Since 2011 I have identified as Asexual and more recently as Aromantic.  


However; for the last few years I have been struggling with my identity. I haven't received any usual dysphoria (Or so I thought) so I thought you couldn't qualify as non-binary. I have been known to get my hair cut 'too short or butch' according to my mother - but every time I do - I love it. Also, I love it when my hair is bright (currently copper/orange)   


Since I first started getting periods - I have always suffered with them. I get flu like symptoms and the pain is right down my legs. I have been on the pill a few times and now, when I look at it - I love NOT having my period. I feel more myself. The amount of times I want to rip out my uterus I have lost count and want a hystorectorymy; however, due to my health conditions - surgery is to much of a risk.

&amp;#x200B;

I hated being referred to as a princess or girl. Although, I am not fased by the term woman or my pronouns being she. If they were to use 'they' then that wouldn't worry me. Growing up I had a tomboy phrase and for a long time, I didn't wear dresses. Now - I do, but they are rockabilly ones.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't wear nail polish, shave my legs and can't wax my eyebrows. I have died my eyelashes but it is only really to please my mother, I like it sometimes but other times not. I dislike anything overly femmine, and though I have pink dresses, they have surfing skeletons or flamingos on there - so not prissy.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't wear jewelry and have been called butch or dyke before.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know whether I am nonbinary or female, or as it is a spectrum would identify like Rebecca Sugar as a non-binary female. As I do some more research, the more I feel that I am close to female but not all the way there - but also non-binary. I have heard of demigirl and queer but I am not sure.

2020-12-20 22:02:34,kh3e4n,16,1,"Hi there. I really don't know where I can talk about this so I'm making a post here. 

One of my best friends is getting married in June 2021, and she asked me to be a bridesmaid in Jan 2020. At that time, I hadn't really explored my gender at all. I knew I was nonbinary but still fully presented as a girl and hadn't told anyone at all. 

Flash forward a year later and I'm dressing a lot more masc and am out to a handful of people.... and its' time to order a dress. Most of the bridesmaids have already picked theirs out and some even have theirs already... but I've been procrastinating because I literally do not know what to do. 

It's not that I'm uncomfortable with the dress itself, I'm more uncomfortable with the assumption that I'm a cis woman if I'm dressed the same as all the women and standing along with all the women. If that makes any sense. I actually like dresses, but something about it in this context just feels off. And as I come out to more people and get increasingly masc I don't want to confuse anyone (the group of friends in this wedding are all cishet)

The bride said I can wear what makes me comfortable. Today I tried on a dress (too naked, too feminine) and a suit (too boxy, too hot) and I feel like I'm being too picky. A jumpsuit was an idea but I'm plus sized with a bigger stomach so would not feel flattered in that. 

I'm thinking of just wearing a dress and my binder so I'm flat, and then maybe some sort of non-bulky jacket on top of that, but I'm not sure if that would look/feel okay. Paired with minimal makeup, my usual ""men's"" hairstyle, and men's dress shoes? 

tl;dr  I'm just confused and stressed about what to wear to be in my friend's wedding and nothing I've tried is comfortable. Bride is understanding and letting me do what I want but I don't know what I want. 

Has anyone else ever been in this situation??? Help this they/them out pls

When I addressed it I asked for he/she, as even split as possible... but a few of my friends struggled really hard to remember to switch to he, because I am also using she still. (I will say that my gender most aligns with an intersexed body, so I would consider myself fairly firmly 'gendered', but outside the standard binary) At that point I chose to expand to they/them, not my original desire but I thought if I could help get them off of exclusively using female I would be happier... and for a little bit I was.

I've actually been getting some dysphoria when I hear they/them used for me, but I don't want to go back to ending up only she/her again because the growth to use a mix of pronouns is hard for people to do. This is doubling down because I recently came out to my family (Anyone who isn't supportive has just decided not to contact me ever again, which I'm okay with).

As I say in the title, I know that I'm not getting proper legal advice from you all! But I thought, as other NBs, you may have more wisdom. Alternatively, if any of you know of a better sub to take this question to, I'm also happy.

I was born in a state (in the USA) that does not offer an X gender designation on birth certificates or state IDs. So, my certificate says, and will probably say for a while, M. Ditto my passport, as the US federal government doesn't offer such a designation either. However, the state in which I currently live not only allows for a change to X on birth certificates and driver licenses, but allows for it by self-declaration, rather than through a court order or doctor's affidavit. I may not be living in this state for much longer, so I of course will not be acting on anything soon. But, it does have me thinking.

My question: what potential consequences could there be for me if I were to change my gender designation to X on a driver license in a state in which I currently reside, while my birth certificate and passport do not have that designation? I know in the USA, so much of our bureaucracy is fractured, so it might not be the biggest deal. But I'm still worried. The same question applies to a situation where I might have a license with X as my gender designation in one state, but am moving to a state that does not offer such a designation. Would there be significant difficulty there, apart from simply being forced to choose M or F? (I've had to say M so much on official paperwork that it doesn't bother me to do it, but I would love to be able to be a bit more open about who I am.)

Again, this may not be the best forum, but I figured it was a place to start while I also chase down people knowledgeable in law on my own. If you know of any other subs that this would be better fir in, I'm also happy to have that help.

Would there be significant difficulty there, apart from simply being forced to choose M or F? (I've had to say M so much on official paperwork that it doesn't bother me to do it, but I would love to be able to be a bit more open about who I am.)\n\nAgain, this may not be the best forum, but I figured it was a place to start while I also chase down people knowledgeable in law on my own. If you know of any other subs that this would be better fir in, I'm also happy to have that help.

2020-12-21 04:37:30,kha6l5,4,1,"Hello,

I had been identifying as bigender (agender/male) for some time, but I believe I've been misusing those terms. 

Firstly, agender is defined as ""genderless or lacking gender"". What I had been referring to as ""agender"" is definitely a distinct gender, just something other than male nor female. 

After coming to that realization, I started to really like the term ""aporagender"" ( ""a gender separate from male, female, and anything in between, while still having a very strong and specific gendered feeling""), but I'm not sure if that's an accepted term in the trans or non-binary communities. I was going to just edit my terminology to ""bigender (aporagender/male)"".

However, while I know bigender can be used to include non-binary identities, the term seems to be more geared towards male/female identities. I'm just not sure if it's the right term, and I'd love some clarity or insight about that.

I was also curious about the term ""genderfaun"". It perfectly encompasses my gender identity, but I've never heard it used, and I was wondering if it's an accepted term or not.

growing up i've always been really feminine, i hyperfixated on the colour pink, princesses and stuff growing up, so i've always assumed im a girl. until this year (im 14). i was apart of an online roleplay group and i often roleplayed as male characters because i felt more comfortable doing so. i assumed it was because i tend to prefer male characters in general. but i realized it was more of a 'i actually like it when people perceive me as something different'. i started to try going by a more androgynous appearance online and stuff. people still referred to me as 'she', which i don't necessarily mind but yeah. sometimes people would actually refer to me as 'he' though and i'd feel bad and correct them because i felt like i was misleading them, and then i'd feel stupid about correcting them about it afterwards. i still identified as cisgender at the time though.

as of right now, i still have a male avatar online (the username is pretty feminine though so, im not sure if people see me as not a girl, or a girl still). i also do cosplay, mainly male characters because i do tend to prefer them. i cosplay armin arlert, and i noticed when i put on the wig that i looked kinda androgynous, and i felt kinda happy about it for a second. this hasn't happened with any other cosplays, i think.-

theres been another time where i was presenting myself femininely online, but i was hesitant to - actually say i was a girl. or like- i made a persona for myself, and they present themselevs femininely but when i actually was writing their bio, i felt hesitant to put down 'girl', so i just put down pronouns instead.

but then there have been a lot of other times when i don't mind being perceived as a girl. if i had to give a ratio it'd maybe be like 65-75 percent of the time = girl, to 35-25 percent of the time = something else. i've questioned genderfluid, demigirl n stuff. but im really not sure. maybe even agender. like what does gender even feel like to begin with ???? if anyone could help out that'd be really awesome 1!!! gdsgasghashgasdgh thank u",NonBinary,questioning ??? aaahh,1608578097.0,"{'created_utc': 1608552897, 'id': 'khg9w2', 'num_comments': 3, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""i just kinda wanna vent, but if anyone has any tips then feel free to add them !! aahh idk waaa- \n\ngrowing up i've always been really feminine, i hyperfixated on the colour pink, princesses and stuff growing up, so i've always assumed im a girl. until this year (im 14). i was apart of an online roleplay group and i often roleplayed as male characters because i felt more comfortable doing so. i assumed it was because i tend to prefer male characters in general. but i realized it was more of a 'i actually like it when people perceive me as something different'. i started to try going by a more androgynous appearance online and stuff. people still referred to me as 'she', which i don't necessarily mind but yeah. sometimes people would actually refer to me as 'he' though and i'd feel bad and correct them because i felt like i was misleading them, and then i'd feel stupid about correcting them about it afterwards. i still identified as cisgender at the time though.\n\nas of right now, i still have a male avatar online (the username is pretty feminine though so, im not sure if people see me as not a girl, or a girl still). i also do cosplay, mainly male characters because i do tend to prefer them. i cosplay armin arlert, and i noticed when i put on the wig that i looked kinda androgynous, and i felt kinda happy about it for a second. this hasn't happened with any other cosplays, i think.-\n\ntheres been another time where i was presenting myself femininely online, but i was hesitant to - actually say i was a girl. or like- i made a persona for myself, and they present themselevs femininely but when i actually was writing their bio, i felt hesitant to put down 'girl', so i just put down pronouns instead.\n\nbut then there have been a lot of other times when i don't mind being perceived as a girl. if i had to give a ratio it'd maybe be like 65-75 percent of the time = girl, to 35-25 percent of the time = something else. i've questioned genderfluid, demigirl n stuff. but im really not sure. maybe even agender. like what does gender even feel like to begin with ???? if anyone could help out that'd be really awesome 1!!! gdsgasghashgasdgh thank u"", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'questioning ??? aaahh', 'created': 1608578097.0}"

Content warning: female puberty

I've always attributed my issues with body image to growing up overweight and I've run into a poor relationship with food as a sort of cure-all to my issues. Now, I'm starting to think that part of that could be gender dysphoria. I'm not super familiar with gender dysphoria is, so I don't want to call this that is it's not what it is.

As a kid (ages 4 - 14 ish) whenever I would get physical I would flip out when a doctor would want to examine my \*private parts\* (I'm trying to keep it PG so it doesn't get flagged or anything), luckily there was nothing wrong because they would've never known.

Also, I remember when I got my period at 13, I was absolutely mortified and I did everything I could to hide it (Idk if this is normal or not) and I've only been able to even mention it within the past year.

I've thought about getting a binder from gc2b but Idk if that's too much, maybe I'm overthinking things.

Overall I don't feel super attached to femininity in its societal form, I feel feminine by default if that makes sense. A lot of the social constructs that are attached to a cis-female identity I don't resonate with.

My original birth name is Daniel, but for now I would like to be called Revan. Daniel is no more, they were a very good person but was misunderstood by society and the years of various forms of abuse and torment killed them. These are parts of my tragic past in no particular order; being raised and brainwashed by Christian conservatives, being bullied by racists in middle school and high school, being falsely accused of a crime I never did and get thrown into an asylum, getting mindfucked during a worship night at a youth group retreat and nearly indoctrinated into a Christian extremist, being placed in special ed during in high school despite not having austism and treated like a freak, and currently being tormented by my anti LGBTQ parents when I bring up my gender and sexual orientation.

 For the past few weeks I felt like an empty husk of my past and I'm constantly haunted by it through minor PTSD. My family is anti LGBTQ and deny I went through much. I was ready to either kill myself or start a new life. I felt as if a sheer force squeezed the breath from my body leaving me as a lifeless husk of the past. And tonight my beautiful iguana has passed away. She was one of the few joys from my past and I cherished her. With her gone, this was the final nail in the coffin for me. With her gone my old life has officially ended. I will miss her very much.  I felt as if a that same force that squeezed the breath from my body breathed new breath into my lungs. I feel very different, new, and refreshed. 

What am I going to do with my new life I hear you ask? As a nonbinary I get misgendered a lot at my job during the pandemic. I hope to contact my doctor soon and discuss the possibility of going on estrogen. However my goals aren't to transition male to female. Instead I want to take microdoses and make myslef look a little androgynous. I want things to be subtle in case I change my mind. More importantly I do NOT want breasts so if I notice any development I will stop instantly and go from there. I also hope to start applying makeup as soon as I become independent. Like the estrogen I want it subtle so I'm thinking baisc student/stage makeup. 

As for my current new name Revan, the name comes from the word revenannt, person who has returned, especially supposedly from the dead. If you ask me thats a very fitting name, and I  purposely renamed myself after the great Jedi/Sith of the Old Republic. My name may be Revan now, but it's unofficial and I haven't gone through the legal process of changing my name yet. In fact I probably will not until I become independent. If anybody in my family finds out about anything you just read they will think I'm cookoo crazy and God knows what horrible things they would do to me. For my own safety I will keep all of this private from most people in my life, but I wanted to share this with you guys, my queer family.

2020-12-22 12:03:14,ki41wd,4,1,"This is going to be a bit long and rambly, but bare with me. 

I’ve been thinking about this for a while now and decided to ask you all about this. There are so many resources on how to write nonbinay characters, but how does one write a nonbinary society? One that doesn’t know the concept of a gender binary, that doesn’t assign a gender at birth but rather lets people choose their name, pronouns and gender freely, and also change them whenever.
I am honestly lost. I’m nonbinary myself so for me it was always logical to have such a society, but how does one describe it? Would gender even play a big role in a society that accepts it as something so individual? Would man and woman be a part of the gender spectrum or is it better to go for “nonbinary genders” only to not have people project their idea of a binary onto the characters? And would pronouns even be commonly used if they are possibly as individual as a name? Would being trans even be a thing if you aren’t assigned a gender?

I don’t know. But I’d love to hear your ideas. How do you imagine such a society and how many things I probably haven’t even thought of are so influenced by the binary that they would be completely different without it?
Like sexuality, if there isn’t a binary the concept of “attracted to the other” and “attracted to the same” isn’t really a helpful way of explaining it. Are there already words I just don’t know about that aren’t about a binary? Of course pansexual exists, but how would one narrow down the kind of people they are attracted to and would that maybe not even be tied to gender but more about a “type”?

Um. Yes, this is kinda incoherent, but I think you get an idea what I’m asking about.

2020-12-22 20:53:51,kiduri,2,1,"A couple days ago (god, it feels like it's been weeks!), I posted for the first time on reddit, and on this sub. Like many other people, I came here hoping to find out whether I was NB, or at least learn something about my unclear identity. Deep down, I was hoping I could post, and someone would reply, saying, ""Yes, you are NB. You are welcome here."" I was dreading that someone might post the opposite: ""No, you are not NB. You are not welcome here."" What I got was a post from u/chchchoppa which gave me what is probably going to be one of the most consequential pieces of simple advice I will ever receive:

&gt; Gender is a personal label, and the only real way to figure out what you  like thinking of yourself as is to try it out. Try thinking of yourself  as a man. Then as a woman. Then if you have it in you, something else.  If neither man or woman fit and you like thinking of yourself as  something else, you may be NB. 

I spent the last two days doing some deep digging, trying to see if I could find who I am, and not having much luck. Trying to accept that this could be a process that takes weeks, months, years. Then, earlier today, I remembered that advice. I said to myself, ""Okay, let's do this. Pretend you are a man. I am a man."" And it immediately felt wrong. I realized that I've never been comfortable self-applying ""man"". Not even really ""boy"". The idea of someone else doing it, referring to me by saying, ""that man over there"", really weirded me out, to say the least.

""Okay,"" I thought, ""pretend you are a woman. I am a woman."" That didn't feel right, either. I could picture women I might like to be, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't picture myself *as* any of them. ""That woman over there"" was only marginally better than ""that man"". ""That person over there"" was alright, I could deal with that. But, for some reason, it was ""guy"". ""Guy"" is my *jam*. I could be ""that guy over there"" all day. Not fella, not dude, *guy*. I don't know what that means.

But as I stood there thinking, the negative space started making a picture. The thought slowly materialized: ""*I am not a man. And I don't have to be one*."" 

The feeling was amazing. It was so wild that a thought so simple could be so revelatory. I felt like I had spent the past 40 years holding my breath underwater, and had finally come up for air.

I am not a man. And I don't have to be one.

Seeing it there on my screen, in black and white, put there by my own personal fingers, is such a crazy, unreal feeling.

Over the past couple of days, I've read a lot of posts, people who wanted to know if they were NB. I read a lot of replies, a lot of advice, experiences, and unconditional support. My heart goes out to all of you. If I could give some advice of my own, with the wisdom of the neophyte, I would say this:

&gt;Whoever you are, whoever you're not, you *are*. Stay the course. You can do this.

When I made my initial post, I felt like an impostor. I wondered if I was only trying to fit form to a life where I felt I had no identity, or if this was just some kind of weird mid-life crisis. Was I just looking for some niche where I might feel accepted? I still feel that way, a little bit. But those thoughts can take a long walk, or find a rolling doughnut. I am so lucky, so thankful, that I came here and made that post.

I want to also thank u/shyforever for helping me to see that 40 isn't too late to start uncovering yourself from a lifetime of piled expectations. I can't run around pell-mell uprooting my life, but I can take little steps. And now I have something to step toward.

My plan for next year is straight foreward; survive my spring semester and parents up from mid January to May, get a full time job (hoping to work at the hospital), sign up for a youth housing center in my area, and then I can be myself by microdosing estrogen and where (subtle) makeup. After that I will take two more courses in the summer and finally get an associates degree. 

For those wanting to know more of why I want estrogen, click [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/ki61fq/my_life_is_officially_over/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) Belive it or not, trying estrogen is something I wanted to do for a very long time, even before I came out nonbinary. Although it's only going to be a little bit, I really want to cleanse the masculinity out of my body and replace it with more feminine features. However I don't want breasts and will stop as soon as I notice the slightest breast development. I may be nonbinary but I still want to be primarily masculine, just have it turned down a notch. 

People misgender me often, especially during the pandemic. Can I blame them? Not at all! I'm mostly covered up for the winter and I need to wear a mask that hides most of my face. The only indication I'm not only nonbinary but asexual are my pride bracelets. Once the Covid War ends and we don't need to wear masks, I'm so gonna apply some makeup and estrogen will definitely help a lot too. What I want most from the estrogen is to change my facial features a bit and maybe give myself a slightly androgynous look. I'm a bit on the chubby side so I'm curious to see if it will change my body build to make me sleek, even just a little. Of course I can exercise more to loose weight or something, but I heard estrogen lowers muscle mass. This may be a good think if I want a more average body build (I'm not an athlete). 

While living with my transphobic parents I could do things like eat more soy products. I heard there was an incident where a man drank a lot of soy milk and unintentionally ended up having large breasts. As an enby who wants to keep my estrogen minimal I want to be more careful. I think its best to wait and get a prescription from a trained professional.

Writing all of this makes me feel very excited and optimistic for my future, but it also makes me very nervous! I don't know what to really expect! I'm worried that I may get too emotional and confuse people. I'm not that emotional to begin with and it always made me feel dead inside. If I watch a movie that's funny, my brain would acknowledge that it's funny, but I can't express it. Recently my cherished iguana passed away and was the nail in the coffin of my old life, but I couldn't get myself to cry despite knowing that her passing is a sad thing. 

And lastly I want to know what effects estrogen will have on various body parts. I know the testes will shrink on high doses and I don't want to damage my sperm incase I want children someday. Are there any other effects estrogen has that I need to know about?

I’m really frustrated because I feel like all the friends I’ve talked to about this don’t understand or know what to say and it’s just like really on my mind all the time. I’m also kind of seeing this new girl and I want to talk to her about it but I don’t know if it’ll be too much for her? I think she’d be okay with it but it still just all terrifies me a little bit. I’m not sure what I really am , and I honestly do feel like I’m putting pressure on myself to find out , even though I know I shouldn’t. I feel like I’m everything but nothing all at once.

2020-12-23 14:09:24,kitqhr,8,1,"Hello! As a recently questioning potential enby, I've had a lot of self doubt over my lack of strong dysphoria. And I'm using dysphoria in the way it's used medically - like STRONG discomfort and distress. 

But I think I do experience some gender incongruence? I often enjoy clothes that hide my chest now, I wiSh I had more of an upper body and have tried to get more muscular. I wish I had a jawline, I love being taller than people, especially boys (I'm 174cm so I'm kinda tall for a 'girl'). 

I was asking my mum about how I was gender expression wise as a kid. She says I did always enjoy clothes and did the classic Disney Princess dress up. But I also adored this one pair of cargo shorts and often wore comfy genderless clothes for play and trips. Basically, I was never forced into feminity by my family and I did what I wanted. 

Looking back I remember random things like LOVING this button down I had when I was 10, wearing a tie over my t shirts sometimes, usually wearing trousers to school. One time when I was 15 I vividly remember dressing more masc that usual (I never thought I could pull it off or knew how to) and I felt so good? My sweater hid my chest and I actually looked into binding before telling myself I was being silly.

I know gender expression and gender identity are different, but I needed to spend some time reflecting to see if my current feelings align with older ones. 

As a teenager I did feminity in the traditional sense. Little dresses and skirts, makeup, feminine haircuts. But now (I'm 19) I've started questioning everything, dressing more masc, I'd already grown out my body hair, I wear makeup rarely now.

Hi everyone,

Lately I've noticed more posts about low-dose testosterone. I started Testogel (Androgel) five weeks ago and thought I would share with you what I've noticed so far. Of course, testosterone effects everyone differently, but I thought this might be interesting to those of you considering T, and of course, **questions are welcome** either here or through DM. I'm not an expert but I can share what I've experienced.

Without further ado, the changes:

**SKIN**

Within a few days, my skin felt slightly coarser to the touch. At the end of the first week, I woke up and touched my face to find it noticeably oilier. Week four I suddenly got a fair bit of acne; I expected this would happen eventually based on relatives' skin experiences during puberty.

**HAIR**

I naturally have thick, dark leg hair and a small amount of body hair. A few new dark hairs have sprouted around my nipples, belly button, and chest. I already had a small amount of hair in these areas. The hair on my face (which I've been shaving regularly for about a year) seems to regrow more quickly.

**BOTTOM GROWTH**

Within the first three days I noticed (and felt) growth. It slowed and then stopped completely by the second week. In the past few days, a secont 'spurt' has started.

**VOICE**

Before starting T, I had done some voice training independently and spoke at a pitch of 165-170hz. My voice began to crack in the first week. Now I speak consistently at an average pitch between 160-164hz. I notice that the sensation of speaking has changed a little and it is more difficult to control my pitch than it was before.

**BODY**

Last week I was changing and noticed my waist seemed to have filled out slightly. This was a very pleasant surprise, as I hadn't expected it to happen so soon. Before COVID, I went to the gym to lift weights regularly. Now I'm confined to my room with some small barbells, so I haven't seen much muscle growth. However, my muscles feel firmer to the touch and I can do slightly more reps than previously.

**MENTAL HEALTH/LIBIDO/APPETITE**

I normally have a naturally high libido, which felt very slightly supressed in the first three weeks. In weeks four and five it jumped up to a little higher than it used to be. Many people report feeling more anxious on T, but I find I feel a little more relaxed, despite having serious mental health problems to begin with. I am perhaps a *little* more impatient. My appetite, surprisingly, also seems surpressed, but I was incredibly thirsty for the first two weeks, and in weeks three through five I continue to drink more than I used to.

That's it! I hope it was at least a little interesting to you.

However, my muscles feel firmer to the touch and I can do slightly more reps than previously.

**MENTAL HEALTH/LIBIDO/APPETITE**

I normally have a naturally high libido, which felt very slightly supressed in the first three weeks. In weeks four and five it jumped up to a little higher than it used to be. Many people report feeling more anxious on T, but I find I feel a little more relaxed, despite having serious mental health problems to begin with. I am perhaps a *little* more impatient. My appetite, surprisingly, also seems surpressed, but I was incredibly thirsty for the first two weeks, and in weeks three through five I continue to drink more than I used to.

That's it! I hope it was at least a little interesting to you. Thanks for reading, and let me know if you have any questions!",NonBinary,First month on low-dose T; Here's what it's been like so far,1608766113.0,"{'created_utc': 1608740913, 'id': 'kiw4wg', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 1, 'selftext': "" \n\nHi everyone,\n\nLately I've noticed more posts about low-dose testosterone. I started Testogel (Androgel) five weeks ago and thought I would share with you what I've noticed so far. Of course, testosterone effects everyone differently, but I thought this might be interesting to those of you considering T, and of course, **questions are welcome** either here or through DM. I'm not an expert but I can share what I've experienced.\n\nWithout further ado, the changes:\n\n**SKIN**\n\nWithin a few days, my skin felt slightly coarser to the touch. At the end of the first week, I woke up and touched my face to find it noticeably oilier. Week four I suddenly got a fair bit of acne; I expected this would happen eventually based on relatives' skin experiences during puberty.\n\n**HAIR**\n\nI naturally have thick, dark leg hair and a small amount of body hair. A few new dark hairs have sprouted around my nipples, belly button, and chest. I already had a small amount of hair in these areas. The hair on my face (which I've been shaving regularly for about a year) seems to regrow more quickly.\n\n**BOTTOM GROWTH**\n\nWithin the first three days I noticed (and felt) growth. It slowed and then stopped completely by the second week. In the past few days, a secont 'spurt' has started.\n\n**VOICE**\n\nBefore starting T, I had done some voice training independently and spoke at a pitch of 165-170hz. My voice began to crack in the first week. Now I speak consistently at an average pitch between 160-164hz. I notice that the sensation of speaking has changed a little and it is more difficult to control my pitch than it was before.\n\n**BODY**\n\nLast week I was changing and noticed my waist seemed to have filled out slightly.

2020-12-23 20:40:10,kj0u4z,3,1,"Hey People, 

This whole ... ""thing"" started kind of weird for me: I'm 26 years old and thought for most of my life that I would simply be a cis-male, liking females and going around with a bio. male body - you know, that generic beefstake package.

But just a few days ago I tumbled over a interesting question: ""How would you describe your gender without using words like male, female ,etc. ?"" And there I was like ""hah., I started researching about gender in general and felt a kind of relief that your gender and sex and your sexual attraction can actually be different things and there, the rabbithole started really to get on track for me. 

I looked through different non-binary/queer wikis and blogs and videos and found a term that feels just more fitting to me than ""cis"" : agender - simply feeling like me and not like a typical (how does this should work anyway?) ""man"" or ""woman"" or somewhere inbetween, which makes me also unsure if this is the right question for that subreddit here.

Whats my point is that I feel like someone told me ""you can also take this jacket off, you know?"" and I am like ""oh what?"" - I never even considered to be allowed to feel valid about not having to assign myself to a certain gender, this is also where my selfsdoubts come into play: I never in my life really thought much about me being a boy or what doest it mean to be one, I feel okay with having a male body although I was never into any kind of a certain masculine fashion or anything. No problems with being called ""he/him"" (although I'am thinking about trying they for a while now.) or any particulary kind of missfit with the people around me (but now particular connection either.) What I had, also in the last years was this vague feeling of not really identifying with being ""a male"" guessing that most people have no strong connection to their gender and therefore do not talk about it much. Due to some other mental health issues its really hard for me to feel valid in anything I think about, but still, when thinking about ""I could be agender."" I feel a certain confidence and also a slice of joy, theres just this ""inner critique"" pondering at me, giving me the feeling thats just bullshit and that I am just some weirdly coping cis in a pandemic crisis, being nothing special and not deserving of this, comparing me to those ""real biographies"" of real non-binary people. In fact, this whole gender research felt like some doorbreach maneuver for me, through a door that maybe was there all the time? And now theres that (agender) label for now, standing in front of me being like ""you cool."" and me is like ""no. i succ.""

What I am may asking here is: Am I valid without having a more specific history of ""valid doubt""? (duh.)

What helped me a bit was the idea of imagine myself without my body like in some freeform editor, what came out of this is a picture of me being simply...me? some mostly neutral being with lots of confusing stuff sticking all around me of which I still have to decide if its a house or a cage.

""man"" or ""woman"" or somewhere inbetween, which makes me also unsure if this is the right question for that subreddit here.\n\nWhats my point is that I feel like someone told me ""you can also take this jacket off, you know?"" and I am like ""oh what?"" - I never even considered to be allowed to feel valid about not having to assign myself to a certain gender, this is also where my selfsdoubts come into play: I never in my life really thought much about me being a boy or what doest it mean to be one, I feel okay with having a male body although I was never into any kind of a certain masculine fashion or anything. No problems with being called ""he/him"" (although I\'am thinking about trying they for a while now.) or any particulary kind of missfit with the people around me (but now particular connection either.) What I had, also in the last years was this vague feeling of not really identifying with being ""a male"" guessing that most people have no strong connection to their gender and therefore do not talk about it much. Due to some other mental health issues its really hard for me to feel valid in anything I think about, but still, when thinking about ""I could be agender."" I feel a certain confidence and also a slice of joy, theres just this ""inner critique"" pondering at me, giving me the feeling thats just bullshit and that I am just some weirdly coping cis in a pandemic crisis, being nothing special and not deserving of this, comparing me to those ""real biographies"" of real non-binary people. In fact, this whole gender research felt like some doorbreach maneuver for me, through a door that maybe was there all the time? And now theres that (agender) label for now, standing in front of me being like ""you cool."" and me is like ""no. i succ.""\n\nWhat I am may asking here is: Am I valid without having a more specific history of ""valid doubt""? (duh.)\n\nWhat helped me a bit was the idea of imagine myself without my body like in some freeform editor, what came out of this is a picture of me being simply...me? some mostly neutral being with lots of confusing stuff sticking all around me of which I still have to decide if its a house or a cage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for all that tryhard poetry, have a nice one.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Questioning validity of my thoughts, AMAB', 'created': 1608781210.0}"

2020-12-24 00:56:32,kj5eu8,1,1,"So you want a new name! That's very cool! Here's some pointers: 

1. Try a baby naming website. I recommend [this one](https://www.babynames.com/names/search.php) that lets you search for gender neutral, masculine, or feminine names by nationality and meaning.
2. Try to keep your initials. This, at least, gives you a place to start, as opposed to looking at all names ever, and can make some things marginally easier down the line.
3. Overshoot towards the other binary gender from how you're usually gendered if you want to use your name to indicate androgyny/gender fuckery. For example, Riley is a very androgynous name, but if people tend to read you as a feminine person, they're always going to assume it in its feminine form. 
4. Keep in mind when the name came into prominence. If you're young this won't be as noticeable, but for older folks it may be weird to have a name that's ""too young"".

To start this off, I have three siblings: a younger sister, and two older brothers. Let's call one fo them A. Two days ago A and I were working on a little project for one of our relatives for Christmas, we were just talking about life and suddenly A brings up all of these extremely gross controversial opinions and using slurs. He's white and claims using the N word is a good thing because it ""helps give the word less meaning"" anyway, A randomly brings up my instagram account that I have, which is weird because it wasn't connected to anything at all, so he had to have done snooping of some sort to find it. A informed me that he and my uncle showed my father, and subsequently the rest of our entire extended family, and that I have been marked as a disgrace. They all have been calling me an ""it"" and having been mocking me for weeks all while I have been cleaning my parents house for them and trying hard to recover from my partners suicide and failing this semester of college. I had wanted to come out eventually, after being more able to support myself (i.e getting a license, graduating college) but now I have been crying non stop for two days and having to pretend in front of my parents that I don't know they all hate me. I love them. With everything. They were terrible parents, but some part of me still really hoped they could love me. But they won't. I messaged my younger sister who never comes around because of how her and I were raised (my mom was very hard on us, and often physically abusive with my sister and I) and she's so upset with everyone, she kind of understands, and she supports me, but because of our abuse we were distanced from one another. I have no idea how my oldest brother and his wife will react, but I raised his son (my nephew) while he was at college and my nephew's biological mother was partying. I raised him and I feel like he's my own, but I don't know if I'll ever see him again after christmas. Besides all of this, I only have two close friends. And I have someone knew I'm talking to, and I'm falling for them, but I feel so bad making all of them out up with me breaking down recently. I don't know what to do.

I am afab and started recently experimenting with clothing more masculine. I identify as nonbinary and am completely happy with that. I am wearing a binder and a packer on a daily basis and that’s all good so far. And now comes something what really hurts me: 

when I got my first binder, i put it on the first time and it was the most beautiful thing I could experience. Finally I felt right in my body and I felt like I found my true self. With the days passing, I liked it less and less to the point where it didn’t feel right anymore. It was right to wear one, don’t get me wrong! I can’t imagine going outside without my armor. But with time I didn’t like the picture i saw in the mirror. The euphoria slowly faded and I started to feel the old feeling of being „not right“. I figured it was because it was the wrong size, so I got a new one, in the right size this time. Same thing as before: I put it on, it looks even better, I feel like a „real man“, I love everything about it. 
And today, I woke up feeling that good old dysphoria again, but even stronger. I got really dark thoughts and sometimes i catch myself being ridiculed by me. This sarcastic voice in my head laughs about me and makes me feel incredibly bad. 

So it looks like a pattern to me which leads me to the conclusion, that there has to be something else deep down in my soul that needs attention. 

Has anyone ever experienced something like this? Or can someone give me some advice?

Honestly I am really scared and don’t really know how to deal with that.

* New terms for me (i got this mostly covered!)
* Phrases/terms and definitions
* What is nonbinary?

And any others sections that are suggested! My parents ARE safe to come out to, I'd NEVER be kicked out, harmed, or unloved- however they may be a bit ignorant, so it's all just explaining.

At the end im also gonna ask for them to buy a binder!

2020-12-24 22:08:19,kjntr6,4,1,"Hey ho! Hope y‘all are having a nice Christmas Eve so far. :)
I spent mine mostly playing Mario Kart with my wife, her brother and one of their friends whom I just got to know today. I noticed something then.
For about one month I ask people to call me Aki instead of my „official name“. People who I talk to for the first time have been totally fine with it so far and it makes me very happy and feeling accepted.
My wife’s brother, who knew me for over eight years now, is also very kind and accepting. I was afraid he would struggle accepting my new name, but he even corrected himself when I was not around to hear him. :)
So far, so good. But today my wife told me, she‘s got some bad feelings lately when she calls me Aki. Don’t get me wrong, she is very, VERY supportive. I probably never dared exploring my identity more when she wasn’t talking so openly with me about this. And she asked me, if she should refer to me differently. She uses my new name when she talks with others about me and even explains the situation when people have trouble understanding it. So today it hit me kinda hard when she expressed her discomfort. I always worried I could make people around me feel uncomfortable with my rather sudden change of expressing my identity, so it was like one of my biggest fears became real. I even suggested she could call me by my old name again, which she refused. She said she really wants to accept my new name. But she also said it is very difficult for her to connect the name to me. We spent the past eight years together and she always knew me as Anna, and now she says it feels like she is talking about a different person, even though she knows there is not much going to change except for the name and other small things. 
We figured it might just take some time for her (and also me) to get used to this change, but to be honest, the topic now kinda hovers over us.

Does anyone of you experienced something like this? How did loved ones deal with a change of name? Is there something that may help getting used to a new name for someone?

I started question this one time I was drunk. I thought about how I never understood what it meant to ""be a guy"" and felt like it was stupid and never made sense. Like, what does that mean? I've never really cared for traditionally manly stuff, and never felt I really fit in anywhere.  ""Maybe I'm nonbinary?""  I thought.  Part of me was like ""id like to be. Its different, kinda edgy"" (please don't jump on me for this. I'm fully aware its dumb and incorrect, immediately after thinking this.) and im an edgy person. But after thinking that, it really upset me. It didn't change the fact I was still thinking about it. I realized if I was questioning the fact that was my reasoning, that probably wasn't the reasoning. It was the other stuff I mentioned,  and when telling my enby friends about that, they agreed it. I kinda kept it on the DL for a bit, thinking about it more. I posted on my Facebook that I thought I might be, and that he/they pronouns are what I wanted.

And ever since then ive...felt better. More comfortable  with myself and less worried about being judged. I know its not really a big deal, but I finally got my mullet, im going to dye it pink. I got pink boots, and im going to sew flowers on my vest. I've always thought gendered clothing is stupid, and I've actually considered buying ones that aren't ""mens"" clothing. I feel better and like its ok for me to do that. Sometimes I select ""nonbinary"" or ""other"" on forms that require gender. Its scary and feels weird and almost wrong but at the same time it makes me feel warm.
While I realize wearing certain colors or clothes that aren't ""for men"" according to society,  breaking that norm feel good to me. I never felt more like myself than I do now. I'm still ok if people call me a guy, it doesn't bother me at all. Maybe im used to it, or I'm deluding myself into thinking im an enby. Maybe i was right and just ""wanted"" to be to feel special or something dumb like that.

But its all very confusing and even though I keep second guessing myself its still starting to feel right for me. Can anyone offer advice, or help me sort these feelings out? I hope someone else can relate to this and hopefully have a similar story so I dont feel alone.

2020-12-25 02:50:28,kjrs0i,5,1,"hey !! basically, i’m feeling like i may be nb and i need a little help working my feelings around the issue out if anyone is inclined to help !! i’ll be discussing issues of gender dysphoria relating to physical characteristics, homophobia and potentially body image below in case anyone doesn’t wanna read that rn !

i’m 19 years old afab and have been raised by a pretty gender normative family, still living with my parents until next september when i will hopefully be leaving for uni. to give you an idea of their views on lgbt and specifically trans issues, i’m bi and have never/will never come out to them because i know that - while they may not necessarily cut me off - they would stigmatise and mock me because they don’t understand it. 

i’ve been coming to terms with the fact that i may be nb/trans recently. since i was young, i have always felt an inexplicable uncomfortable feeling when being referred to with she/her pronouns or addressed by name in conversation. as i grew up i learned to accept it due to the social validation from presenting as femme, but whenever i interact with people, i always feel like i am interacting with them through this femme “persona” that is not truly representative of myself. like very performative ?? which is quite an insidiously uncomfy feeling once the validation wears off.

it’s been a little difficult to disentangle that from the cisnormative, misogynistic and rigid gender roles that are often imposed on women, but i’ve thought about it a little more deeply recently and realised that even if these expectations didn’t exist i’d still feel some level of discomfort from being perceived or referred to as a woman.

the issue is, that i am so tied in and attached to the social validation and security that presenting as femme provides, that it scares me to think about committing to any drastic changes in my gender presentation like cutting my hair shorter or binding. i feel like this is tied in to the expectations placed on me by my family to be a “cis straight girl” (which i am not) and that it would be shameful to be anything else. i also have a very typically “feminine” body (big chest and hips, slimmer waist) which on one level, feels good to know that i have a body type which many people are attracted to - but on another deeper level makes me feel uncomfortable, weird and embarrassed.

i think my purpose in posting this here is this - i would appreciate someone who may have had similar experiences to help me figure out what i’m feeling, because it’s scary and something i’ve repressed for a long time !! and also i need advice on coping with the negative feelings associated with my feminine body and the anxiety of experimenting with more androgynous gender presentations.

2020-12-25 03:52:39,kjsl3w,0,1,"Finally gonna come out for hopefully the last time this time, I've written a poem to attach to a letter, any support for strength or any suggestions for things I can change would be greatly appreciated.

*Letter*

To Mam and Dad, please read together.

I'm writing this letter so that you can have time to process this information whilst I'm out, as I dont entirely have the guts to say it to your face again. Please read the poem before proceeding with this letter.

*Poem*

I know that you see me as your baby girl,
Who's smile can light up your whole world,
But its finally time I say something you already knew,
So that you can understand just what I'm going through,
Why my head was spinning in such a whirl.

You see im actually queer,
Let me just be clear here,
Queer doesnt just mean gay, it's the whole rainbow,
Each part of which had it's own glow,
None of which could disappear.

And let me be the first to say,
That even though I may go by they,
I'm still your child,
And I'm not at all riled,
That you were confused or even thought I was strange.

And even if I changed my name,
I hope your still treat me the same,
Because I'd still be your baby,
And even though you may find this scary,
Im still me and this isn't a game.

Please just try to research this,
I'm done with this gender crisis,
I know you can learn,
And this time I'm standing firm.

I'm non binary,
I hope you can understand this,
Please just research and respect my pronouns.

*rest of the letter*

Thank you for reading the poem first, I want you to know that this is in no way supposed to be confrontational, which is another reason I left a letter. As you're aware, and more so from the poem, I'm bi gender. There is a full handwritten description on another piece of paper onp what this is, how it affects me and other things you could call me or you can watch this video I found to research yourself, then refer back if you need any other information. If you have any questions then feel free to ring me once you've processed this information and looked into it to figure things out.thank you for reading this and I hope you can come to terms with this and understand how I feel. I would also like to ask you to use my pronouns, they/them and call me Aiden to get used to it so when I change my name it's not so sudden. I also want you to know that if at any point you want to talk about how I can remind you to use my pronouns and call me Aiden in a way that won't offend or upset you then please ask to talk to me about it.

Okay, so as a non-binary AFAB I have always physically identified as soft masculine but aesthetically femme. I have felt for the longest time I was missing a penis or penis equivalent and have had interest in bottom growth with T. My only issue is that I haven't really seen any forum on bottom growth for NB folx only top surgery or starting T. The only thing I want from the T would be my very own (possibly small) penis. Is this common? Has anyone else done T for this purpose who isn't FtM? I just want my genitalia to match my inside which would be a penis with vulva and the benefit of a slightly lower voice. Can I stop T once I reached my desired length or do I need to keep doing T to keep them?

2020-12-27 04:14:35,kkwxiw,25,1,"I tried searching in this sub and haven’t found much, so sorry if this has been discussed before and I’ve missed it. 

I’m currently pregnant and while my partner and I know the sex, we’re considering not assigning gender when baby is born. I would use they/them pronouns, and make sure identity is something that’s talked about from a very very young age, and have check ins when it comes to identity regularly, so that I can ask how the kid wants to be addressed and how they’re feeling. 

My reasoning is that we use they/them with strangers (at least I think that’s the polite thing to do) until we know their preferred pronouns. A lot of parents (mine included) have said they tried to ‘raise boys and girls the same’ to avoid gender stereotypes but in my experience, it didn’t do anything. Basically, my mom would buy me overalls (BoY cLoThInG) as a kid, but because I’m AFAB, relatives still bought all pink everything. Strangers still treated me like a girl. I learned to accept that I WAS a girl just because it had been said my whole life.

I talked about this on one of my parent forums which turned into a huge mess, with some people saying they wanted to do the same, and some people saying it would LITERALLY be child abuse. I’ve since left those forums because they’re honestly just overall bad.

Anyway, my hang up is that I don’t feel 100% qualified to make this decision. I’m worried that this could be problematic in a way I’m not seeing yet. While I don’t identify with a gender, I’m new to that realization and I’m hardly even ‘out’ as nonbinary. I’m new to the community.

Gender identity disorder is something I've dealt with for pretty much all my life, especially if your born male in a christian home. Let me tell you, it was a **bitch**, I couldn't feel right doing anything, even things I loved doing somehow felt wrong. My skin wasn't mine, my hair was too short, too long, my glasses were to big or small, nothing felt right to me.

When I was 6 I was at a peek, everything feminine, then years later I switched to masculine, and every few few years it'd be a back and forth until around the start of 2020. For the most part, as I'm sure everyone knows, it was a terrible year, but the quarantine allowed for one good thing, self reflection, something I had never had the time to do cause I was to stuck in my hobbies trying to push these thoughts out of my head.

At first it was hell, I didn't have anything to distract myself from my thoughts. At first I thought that I was gender-fluid because of my past going back and fourth between gender identities, it didn't stick. At one point I did have a clear difference, but it had faded over the years, all interests becoming one and dysphoria still hitting me hard.

I don't even remember when I first learned about Non-Binary, might have been one of those dumb online quizzes, but it stuck out, felt right. So I kept researching. While I'm not out, and will probably never be for a few years, I have been allowed to express myself in a few ways, long and dyed hair, painted nails, jewelry and I even have a purse. I wonder if maybe they know I might not be as straight as I try and portray myself, but mom just keeps telling me and everyone that I, ""have an artistic soul.""

My story might not be as revolutionary as some, but its one I wanted to get out there.

2020-12-27 18:42:21,kl8ty1,5,1,"i feel kind of stupid writing this post and i hope it‘s okay and by the rules of this sub 

i‘ve been thinking about my gender identity a lot the past couple of months. it all started when i was having drinks with a friend (covid cases were low at the time in my country) and it just kind of overcame me that i just hate the idea of the gender binary and that someone just „chose“ that i was a woman and that i had no say in it and was never asked about what i identify as
i thought about my childhood and it just all made sense to me that i‘m really not a woman, i was very emotional and later that night talked with my partner (who was extremely supportive and amazing) and cried a lot

So. I have wanted to start letting more people know, particularly people I thought wouldn’t be entirely 🤯 about the concept itself. I haven’t told anyone else who currently works at [jobplace], and I would prefer to stay in the closet as it relates to my job. I feel like if I was outed things would end up safer here than they were in [previous jobplace], but it’s not a battle I want to fight at this point. However, I am at a point in my life where I don’t want to spend my free time (like dnd) hiding anymore, so I would really appreciate if you start thinking about not using woman-related words and pronouns for me.

Most definitions of the two aforementioned terms more often than not explicitly state that they are woman-only things, thereby excluding even the possibility of a non-binary person of any assigned sex being lesbian. This is problematic to me because some non-binary people *are* lesbian.

Additionally, most definitions of those words imply or state that lesbian individuals all have or require a vulva and or vagina to be lesbian, but, again, a dyadic AMAB non-binary person may be lesbian, so they may not have a vulva and or vagina, whether that be by way of natal primary sex characteristics or through acquirement by way of surgery later in their life.

same with coming out as enby..... except for german. and this is where my infinite difficulty lies.

you see, to anyone that doesn't speak german, these are the main pronouns when reffering to a person with gender:

-er (male, he)

-sie (female, she)

-sie (neutral plural, they)

-es (neutral object, it)

notice how she and they are the same? but it gets worse.

coming out as gay can be as simple as bringing your bf home. vice versa for lesbians. (assuming you have a supporting mother, like i do)

as for trans, i'm not sure of the entire process but i think it starts with an open talk with the parent to let them know who you are.

2020-12-28 22:42:09,km0vbi,8,1,"Hello! 
My name is Joey, I identify as Non-binary and am caught a bit between microlabels, which I usually don't use because they confuse me a bit lol. 

In the past year I've started to quietly accept myself as a Non-binary individual. Ive had people start addressing me as if Jo, my middle name, was my first name, and it's made me feel SO much better.

I've been wearing a binder on and off the past few months. My whole life I've been a bit uncomfy with having breasts but I sort of just got over it, dealt with it and just went about life as usual. After sort of realizing my gender, however, I have realized how much they bother me. I've been binding almost daily the past few weeks, and I feel uncomfortable leaving the house without binding. I see so many transmasc people who have gotten top surgery and I feel so envious of them (even though I lean towards the feminine and don't consider myself to be transmasc). I try to ignore my chest in the shower, when I'm changing, etc, and wear baggy clothes when I can't bind. I wear a form fitting apron at work and it accentuates my chest, which I hate. 

This feeling really fluctuates, though. Sometimes I'm okay with my chest, on days I'm feeling more feminine and want to present as such. Sometimes I really barely notice they're there and I use a regular bra and wear clothes that fit me properly and I'm fine. 

But the majority of the time, I don't want them. They don't cause me an extreme amount of distress, but they're frustrating and I find them inconvenient and in the way. 

I have thought a lot about pursuing top surgery but I have a lot of hesitance about it. 
What if I'm not feminine enough on my more feminine leaning days after top surgery?
What if I don't like how my chest looks?
What if my boyfriend isn't attracted to me anymore? (He said that he'll be attracted to me no matter what, but still). 
 
I have yet to speak to my therapist about any of this, but I intend to within the next few weeks.

2020-12-29 00:04:11,km2f04,2,1,"Hi y'all!! Here we go again...

Early this year I started questioning my gender identity (afab) and after research and talking to some people I came to the conclusion I'm an enby (top dysphoria included in the pack) and been happily living as one since.

BUT.
Lately I developed a masculine clothing obsession (mostly button shirts and sweaters) and started feeling more confortable in this clothing rather than skirts and dresses (still love them tho), and started feeling like maybe I'm not just enby but a trans guy and idk what to do or how to feel.

I have a trans friend that I feel so emotionally attached to him since I first met him and he's been the most supporting one since my outing, and I'd kill for him. I told him this and he was still supporting AF and he even helped me to find a name that suits me for the day I don't feel attached to my assigned one anymore, but also told me that since I'm not 100% sure I could start with small things like asking the closest friends to use only he/him pronouns with me (in my language there's no neutral option so I go with she/her as a ""default"") and that ""alternative"" name (Alex). The little problem is that only he knows that and he's the only one I feel confortable with doing it and it would be weird him calling me by different name and pronouns when the friend group is together.

For now I just changed the gender to masculine and name to Alex in videogames like animal crossing, stardew valley and some other random ones and at first was a little weird but now it's like ""yeah, that sounds good"".

I don't know if that's just a phase every enby has at one point in their life, if I'm really a trans guy or it's just the current world situation that's stressing and cofusing the hell out of me and I need some advice, please and thank you in advance :)",NonBinary,Enby questioning their gender identity again,1609225451.0,"{'created_utc': 1609200251, 'id': 'km2f04', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Hi y\'all!!

I got roped into an argument with a terf on a main sub a few days ago, and ended up having to block her. I was pretty disturbed by our conversation, especially considering that she is a lesbian, which I know is classic terf but I'm always surprised when members of our community enact that kind of violence on us. 

So I posted a whole bunch of trans supportive memes to facebook to try and make myself feel a little better, even mentioned that was what I was doing. And on several of my posts people who normally share most of my radical views had some kinda shitty things to say. 

And then the fucking icing on the cake!

2020-12-29 14:56:55,kmfwld,1,1,"Hi! So im a cis person struggling to understand certain neo-pronouns. Firstly, id like mention I am not hating on these pronouns at all, I just am seeking some education onto the subject so I can be more supportive to a friend. 

So, a friend of mine recently came out as using fae pronouns in addition to she and they. Initially, I was just really confused. I am familiar with neo-pronouns and think they are really important and beneficial to express gender identities that are not male or female and rather somewhere in between or no where at all. Things like Xe/Xem/Xyrs make total sense to me. 

But, where my understanding of neo-pronouns begins to become a bit lacking is when pronouns like fae/faer or bun/bunself come into play. What I don't get is how faeries or bunnies are a gender identity. Faeries are creatures worked with in Celtic religion and bunnies are animals. Therefore to me it seems, both of these things aren't really within the realm of gender expression at all? Feeling like a faerie doesn't seem like a gender thing but rather a special interest. I did ask my friend and fae honestly seemed to not know either. Fae said fae felt more like a creature rather than a girl and also just really likes faeries (Fae are Wiccan and work with the Fae and it is definitely a special interest for faer) 

Now, after some research and speaking with some friends- it does seem to be that neo-pronouns like these are quite common with people who are neurodivergent or on the spectrum. From my understanding, most people who go by these pronouns often have a difficult time understanding gender and the lines between gender and other things, coupled with the fact they simply experience gender much differently. Would you guys say this is accurate?

Also, I am aware that fae pronouns have an additional discourse as to how it is offensive to those who work with the Fae in a religious context, particularly within Celtic culture and pagan religion.   This is a whole other can of worms that I wont really get into as while I am a practicing Wiccan, I am still relatively new to many things, and I don't work with the Fae. But, I will mention my friend is Wiccan and does work with the Fae. 

p.s- I am new to these pronouns and using them for my friend so I apologize of I misused them

TL;DR- How do pronouns like fae/faer express gender if they dont relate to gender? How can feeling like a faerie be a gender identity?

2020-12-29 17:20:35,kmijh0,1,1,"Hi all!

My  name is Shayn and I am a senior at Mount Holyoke College. I am conducting undergraduate honors thesis research into the experiences of nonbinary/trans individuals who use more than one pronoun set. You do not need to identify with the specific label “trans” or even “nonbinary”  to participate — however, you must have a gender that fits into the broad definition of nonbinary gender, meaning your gender lies generally outside of the woman/man gender binary. You must also use more than one  set of pronouns.

Some other important notes/criteria:

* The survey is conducted entirely in English.
* Unfortunately, I am only able to recruit/compensate individuals who live within the United States or Canada (you do not, however, need to be a citizen).
* The survey will likely take between 30 and 45 minutes.
* You must be 18 or older to participate.
* Monetary compensation provided following survey completion.

If  you are unsure about whether you qualify, or you have other questions about the survey before, during, or after participation, please do not hesitate to reach out to me — I can be reached at [psych-study-nb@mtholyoke.edu](mailto:psych-study-nb@mtholyoke.edu).

Thank you!

2020-12-29 23:42:10,kmpxra,3,1,"I think it is impossible for someone who does not believe in the binary gender system, to be purely hetero/homosexual. 

Bisexuality cannot be approached only in the context of the binary gender approach. Person X, who is in a system where men and women are not the only gender identities, is bisexual, for example, if X states that X likes women and nonbinaries.

Similarly, person Y, who describes himself/herself/themselves as a nonbinary, can also be homosexual if Y states that Y has a sexual/emotional interest only towards nonbinaries. Because homosexuality, like other orientations, is not subject to a binary gender approach.

The question that should be asked at this point is that what a cisgender heterosexual interprets from the terms of men and women by using the sentence;  ""I like males/females."" 

If this person uses the traditional explanation of gender in the binary form, for example, if Z, as a cisgender heterosexual man, sees the woman as a feminine person with breasts and vagina with XX hormone, he may call a nonbinary person, whose identity he does not know of, as a woman and say that he has a sexual/romantic arousal towards that person. 

Here, even if Z says that he only likes women, he will be bisexual because the concept of woman he is talking about includes nonbinary people.

Thus, purely hetero/homosexual stereotypes are valid only if they remain within traditional binary expression; otherwise, they do not have a purely hetero/homosexual orientation.

2020-12-30 00:05:10,kmqd7d,2,1,"I’m so sorry, you all probably get this question about fifty times a day in this subreddit but i just don’t know what to do anymore.

I am a 16 year old girl and until about 2 months ago, i had NEVER questioned my gender or felt uncomfortable with being a girl. i loved being a girl. in fifth grade i wanted boobs so badly, and i still to this day wish my body was more feminine.

but i saw something online of someone who found out they were nonbinary because they didn’t mind they/them pronouns and felt uncomfortable in dresses. i also don’t like dressing super feminine, and i don’t mind they/them pronouns either. so ever since i saw this i have been obsessing over my gender and if i’m nonbinary.

it has taken over my entire life. i don’t even know how i feel anymore or who i am. i can’t focus on anything or enjoy my life at all. 

the thing is, i really don’t want to be nonbinary. i just want to be the girl i was before seeing that online. i just want to go back to being secure in my gender and happy. 

nonbinary people, did you feel this way when questioning your gender? does this sound like i’m nonbinary or is this OCD? i have had other OCD themes in the past, including POCD so this could possibly be OCD. i just want to feel like myself again.",NonBinary,Am I NonBinary or is this TOCD? please help me!!,1609311910.0,"{'created_utc': 1609286710, 'id': 'kmqd7d', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'I’m so sorry, you all probably get this question about fifty times a day in this subreddit but i just don’t know what to do anymore.\n\nI am a 16 year old girl and until about 2 months ago, i had NEVER questioned my gender or felt uncomfortable with being a girl. i loved being a girl. in fifth grade i wanted boobs so badly, and i still to this day wish my body was more feminine.\n\nbut i saw something online of someone who found out they were nonbinary because they didn’t mind they/them pronouns and felt uncomfortable in dresses. i also don’t like dressing super feminine, and i don’t mind they/them pronouns either. so ever since i saw this i have been obsessing over my gender and if i’m nonbinary.\n\nit has taken over my entire life. i don’t even know how i feel anymore or who i am. i can’t focus on anything or enjoy my life at all. \n\nthe thing is, i really don’t want to be nonbinary. i just want to be the girl i was before seeing that online. i just want to go back to being secure in my gender and happy. \n\nnonbinary people, did you feel this way when questioning your gender? does this sound like i’m nonbinary or is this OCD? i have had other OCD themes in the past, including POCD so this could possibly be OCD. i just want to feel like myself again.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Am I NonBinary or is this TOCD? please help me!!', 'created': 1609311910.0}"

2020-12-30 03:26:01,kmtxnu,5,1,"hi, i'm afab and i was wondering if anyone has input on resources I could look to as I am questioning my gender identity. 

I really don't understand gender. I've done research, and it still doesn't make sense to me. I have used she/her all my life but I've always hated being considered ""a woman"". I go to an all-girls high school and I dislike the female terminology. The issue is, I am considering an all-women's college (i'm 18 and currently applying to colleges). I think it would be one of the best schools for me and technically, afab nonbinary people can go to the school but... why would i put myself in a position where i am constantly one of the women? part of the sisterhood?

I hit puberty early (around 12-13) and I remember from the moment I saw myself in the mirror with boobs and wide hips, I hated my body. I struggled a lot with body image since then. I over-sexualized myself from like 14-16 (because I was over-sexualized by society and the people around me) but I never really liked my \~female\~ body. I do like long hair, although I recently cut it to just above shoulder length and it is the happiest I have been in a while because it makes me feel slightly more androgynous. 

however, I definitely don't look androgynous. i have very few masculine clothes, but i enjoy wearing them when I can. sometimes i am ok with my feminine side, especially as i am too insecure of my acne to go out without a little base layer of makeup, but other times i will despise looking feminine. I often wear my brother and dad's clothes (as i don't own much masculine clothing) and baggier clothes. i am often trying to adjust my shirt so it does not show my waist. i get annoyed when i can see my narrow waist in the mirror because it shows that i have hips.

the other complication is that i have been thinking i am a lesbian. i have never felt attracted to men, but after questioning my gender identity it confuses me how i could be attracted to just one gender when... gender doesn't feel real for me. 

why is gender? i don't always feel like a woman... but then what is a woman??? i feel as though i'm doing fine as is, and i do not have true gender dysphoria as nonbinary and transgender people do. perhaps i just don't like the way women are treated and perceived in society. i am so confused.

I\'ve done research, and it still doesn\'t make sense to me. I have used she/her all my life but I\'ve always hated being considered ""a woman"". I go to an all-girls high school and I dislike the female terminology. The issue is, I am considering an all-women\'s college (i\'m 18 and currently applying to colleges). I think it would be one of the best schools for me and technically, afab nonbinary people can go to the school but... why would i put myself in a position where i am constantly one of the women? part of the sisterhood?\n\nI hit puberty early (around 12-13) and I remember from the moment I saw myself in the mirror with boobs and wide hips, I hated my body. I struggled a lot with body image since then. I over-sexualized myself from like 14-16 (because I was over-sexualized by society and the people around me) but I never really liked my \\~female\\~ body. I do like long hair, although I recently cut it to just above shoulder length and it is the happiest I have been in a while because it makes me feel slightly more androgynous. \n\nhowever, I definitely don\'t look androgynous. i have very few masculine clothes, but i enjoy wearing them when I can. sometimes i am ok with my feminine side, especially as i am too insecure of my acne to go out without a little base layer of makeup, but other times i will despise looking feminine. I often wear my brother and dad\'s clothes (as i don\'t own much masculine clothing) and baggier clothes. i am often trying to adjust my shirt so it does not show my waist. i get annoyed when i can see my narrow waist in the mirror because it shows that i have hips.\n\nthe other complication is that i have been thinking i am a lesbian. i have never felt attracted to men, but after questioning my gender identity it confuses me how i could be attracted to just one gender when... gender doesn\'t feel real for me. \n\nwhy is gender? i don\'t always feel like a woman... but then what is a woman??? i feel as though i\'m doing fine as is, and i do not have true gender dysphoria as nonbinary and transgender people do. perhaps i just don\'t like the way women are treated and perceived in society. i am so confused.\n\ni am so sorry that this is so long. i don\'t have anyone to talk to about this, and this actually helped just to write out my feelings. but if anyone has any insight, i would so so appreciate it. \n\nthanks!', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'am i non-binary?', 'created': 1609323961.0}"

That aside, hi, I've been a nameless lurker here until a few days ago when a post here really made me dance. So much so I created an account so I could comment. And now I thought I'd put something out there.
Almost a year ago I came across artwork that made me cry, because it was the first time I saw someone that looked how I wanted to. I plucked up the courage to call my mother, to tell her that I wanted to get top surgery, after my husband told me to look into it and see what it would take to do (the fact he supported me right from the get go has been insanely amazing). My mother knew I was bi (or rather demi as I've gotten to know myself better) and she thought I might have been trans at one point, so I thought she'd be ok with top surgery.  Almost a year later she's still processing it and thinking it won't be up to my expectations and my dad will only talk about it clinically (the surgery and all). Gods forbid I try explaining gender fluid. They get non-binary at least. One step at a time.
On December 21st I booked my surgery date (April 21st) and I am still jumping around for joy and excitement (much to the chagrin of my cats). I don't want time to fly by but at the same time, I do. So serious question...for anyone who has done a surgery like this...what did you guys do to not lose your mind waiting?

I am a transmasc individual identifying this way for over 5 years or so. After a looooot of thinking and debating - I finally decided to start microdosing T.
Everyday when I get closer to getting my prescription I feel... Anxious? As If I'm affraid that I am making a wrong decision? That this will impact the resto of my life and I'm just acting on a whim? The same goes to the top surgery I researched for so long and decided on doing in a year or so.

To anyone on hrt or thinking about starting - did you have similar thoughts? I just feel terribly invalid :(. Whenever i talk to my ftm friends they are surprised - they tell me they ached so long to get t and they were nothing but happy... 
I am just so very affraid of doing something so permanent and having those thoughts. 

(Ps. I am an agoraphobe so anxiety is my second name)

Why I decided on T? I just view it as any other hormone - it is a medicine that will help me change my body in a way that I feel more connected to it. Fat redistribution, muscles and no period are sooo wanted.... 

How did you guys know that hrt was the right way? Any advice to an old but new in the topic nb folk?
