Last summer, one of my friends from high school came out as nonbinary to the high school friend group. No biggie, and I was actually pretty excited for them. Apparently they'd be thinking it for a few years and thought it was time to share. 

Today, they announced a name change. That's not too surprising considering how girlie their deadname was. They're at a college far away from me so I don't see them a lot but whenever everyone is back in the hometown we all get together and hang out. 

I feel so inadequate as a nonbinary person compared to them and that if people knew what I knew about myself, they'd think I was copying them or something. I know it's not a competition, but I can't help but feel left of this part of myself whenever talking to them or about them like that. 

They get to be out and get to use their pronouns  and name and I'm stuck in this ultraconservative setting that I can't get out of rn.

i'm having a small identity crisis.  


Enter me, a biologically female 14 year old who's bisexual and supposedly a cisgender girl. But aha- writing myself down as cisgender does not feel ***right.***

I've always felt comfortable with femininity and everything girls did- such as wearing pink (a colour i used to hate, but now have a love-hate relatioinship with) playing with dolls, and just being- girly?

But then again, not SO girly. That makes me uncomfy.

I've always felt tomboyish,  but i hate using that word because it's sexist and I don't think it's actually me.

My family (my parents really) are christian, and girls being very feminine is kind of a must? My mother made me wear skirts, dresses, and everything when i was little, though i preferred them boy jeans because well- BOY JEANS. FOR BOYS.

I used to stand in front of a mirror, re-doing my hair and snatching my dad's clothes and make myself boyish, something I don't do anymore because I'm a girl and I have to  make myself pretty in the mirror and not boyish because I am a GIRL AREN'T I?

I always liked to play the role of the boy\\dad with my friends, but also the mother\\sister role. Playing with my dolls, I made myself a boy, who I named Mike for the longest time (i used to kiss my dolls but my mom caught me once and grounded me).

Now, a small timeskip to about last year.

I found that I liked girls! Me, the most straight person you couldve met! What universe are we in?

I used that as an excuse to start being more boyish again. But *again,* the dreadful teen years.

I started wearing even more skirts, curling my eyelashes, wearing heels, hoop earrings, and fawning over boys \*cough\* kpop idols \*cough\*

***BUT THAT'S SO NOT ME I FEEL LIKE A FAKE WHEN I DO THESE THINGS EXCEPT MY FANGIRLING BECAUSE YES KPOP IDOLS ARE HOT***

THEN THE HEAVENS OPENED!

&gt;""what the f\*ck is a non binary-""

I became more informed about these things- non binary, agender, genderfluid etc...

But my identitiy crisis continued.

I feel like a fake- I don't want to seem as if I follow a trend, or even my brother's influence (ftm).

A few  days ago I found the term ""demigirl.

&amp;#x200B;

I *stared at that wiki page for five minutes.*

&amp;#x200B;

Really, the moment i read the definition I felt such relief that is indescribable. But again, I feel like I'm following a trend- but I'm nOt. Even as I'm writing this i'm getting shaky, panicked and confused. If anyone can help me, I have no idea how- but I need help.

&amp;#x200B;

If this wasn't clear pwease forgive me i'm confused myself THIS TERM IS SO NEW-

&amp;#x200B;

I have a couple of friends who've agreed to refer to me as ""he"" for a bit and so far it feels so comfortable and right.

At the moment, I feel like i'm in a third person. Not boy or girl, like an outside person waiting to decide which one i want to go with.",NonBinary,confused person here,1580614945.0,"{'created_utc': 1580589745, 'id': 'exca4r', 'num_comments': 4, 'score': 1, 'selftext': '&amp;#x200B;\n\ni\'m having a small identity crisis.  \n\n\nEnter me, a biologically female 14 year old who\'s bisexual and supposedly a cisgender girl.

I actually have an update on study abroad! I've narrowed my choices down to the following colleges:

\-Goldsmiths college, London

\-Royal Holloway college, London

\-Aberystwyth college, Wales

\-Edinburgh university, Scotland

This may be a long shot, but if is anyone attending any of these colleges at the moment, or has heard anything about how nonbinary and trans students are treated there, I'd appreciate any info you may have for me!",NonBinary,PART 2: Nervous about studying abroad as a nonbinary student,1580641031.0,"{'created_utc': 1580615831, 'id': 'exij69', 'num_comments': 5, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""Hi!

2020-02-02 06:21:58,exk8sn,4,1,"My grandfather died last week.  He was a wonderful person.  He took me mushroom hunting. He peeled an acorn so I could taste it and see just how terrible it was for myself.  He made me every wooden toy under the sun.  When I was really little I would lay across his lap and he would rub my back.  He always had old-fashioned chocolate drops and a stack of western novels next to his chair. We listened to old country music in on his truck radio.  He taught me to drive.

A few years before him, my dad died. He was a country musician. He played piano, drums, upright bass, guitar...anything.  He played on a show in Branson, MO for 30 years.  At home, I would sing with him at the piano often -- he inspired me to take up music myself, and he cried at my concerts.  He was very old for a father (30 years older than my mother), but he taught me to ride a bike anyway, and helped me build forts in the backyard.  He drove me around town and told me where all the old grocery stores used to be, and took me to his favorite old timey diners and pizza places.  He was a world war II navy veteran and had many stories to tell about it.

A few years before my dad, my grandmother -- the one married to the aforementioned grandfather -- died.  She was a devout Christian -- the kind that actually took the ""compassion"" part to heart.  She was friends with everyone in town, and was always keyed into different struggles that people were going through, always calling and bringing them food or paying them visits.  When she tried to get me to take naps as a child, she would play a music box and softly stroke my eyelids until I fell asleep.  She taught me to draw, and to bake.  At dinner, she would say the most beautiful, touching, and thoughtful prayers.

At my grandfather's funeral last week, all my aunts and uncles and cousins and people who I'm probably related to but don't know how were there.  I wore overalls to commemorate my grandfather, because that's what he always wore.  I couldn't help but fondly remember all the people and traditions that I grew up with, and happily reminisced with my relatives and friends.

But at the same time, I was keenly aware that I was hiding.  I pass among my family as a heterosexual cisgender person -- sort of.  I recently pretty drastically shaved my hair.  My relatives kept asking, ""What did you do to your hair?!"" and ""What does your husband think about that?""  

As I was driving home, I couldn't help but have the horrible thought -- these people wouldn't accept me if they knew who I really am.  It's heartbreaking to think that all these traditions that I cherish so dearly from my childhood are born from the same culture that hates people like me.  My aunt and uncle, who I love so much, have a confederate flag hanging in their garage.  When my grandma and grandpa were alive, once I mentioned that I had a gay friend to them, and they wrinkled their noses in quiet disgust.  The people who I loved so much who have passed -- they would have been confused and hurt to find out that I'm not the perfect young lady that they thought.  If I was just gay, maybe that would be a little more okay -- my aunts and uncles are starting to warm up to the idea -- but not being a girl? That's another thing entirely.

 As I continue on this journey of self discovery, I wrestle with what to share with my family and what to hide from them.  I'm presenting more and more openly, and it's getting harder and harder to hide.  Should I stop sharing selfies on my snapchat story that my aunt is on? Thank god I'm not on facebook anymore.  Should I keep some of my old clothes so I can wear them to family functions (where I can't get by wearing overalls as an homage....)  I haven't decided anything about pronouns yet. I feel pressure to stick with she/her because I know that if I go by they/them, one of my friends might slip and my family would find out.

I hate having to hide from them, but if I stop hiding, what then? Then will there be hateful words -- scars upon my most cherished memories of love with these people. They made up the entire good part of my childhood.  To have that marred by the present would be an incredible wound to bare.

PS: I'm incredibly lucky that I'm in a position where having it come out that I'm non-binary would not make me homeless or ruin my future.  I have a spouse and we support each other.  I'm nearly finished with college.  There are many other enbies and trans people who have it much, much worse than me.

My dysphoria stretches back to early childhood, peaks at puberty, and slowly torments me from my teen years to now. Ive tried to repress it for years, but I can't any more. I have to face reality. Even when I presented binary, I always came off otherwise.

When I came out as gay, (which isn't true because I'm nonbinary, so I'm not gay or straight even though I strictly like one gender), my mom eventually sat me down and said ""Please don't tell me you're trans."" My parents are very liberal and didnt give a shit when I told them I like who I do; they basically shrugged. However, the idea of your child changing their name and body is horrifying and depressing to a parent no matter how much they accept and love you. I'm not out to my parents. Anyway, she and the rest of my family have teased me by implying I dont seem cis (not using those words).  My mom was horrified I was trans. However, a year into being more myself she posted a few things on facebook about nonbinary celebrities and mentioned me; she was defending nonbinary and trans people on my behalf even though I've *never* told her anything. One night in the car she asked the trans question again, and I never liked lying or telling the truth. She said, I kid you not, ""I think you're both."" Even though I would rather identify as ""neither,"" this was a form of visibility that encouraged me a lot. This comment validated how internal and psychological my gender is. Even though I havent come out to her and at that time I hadnt changed my name, she could see who I was. Even though I called myself a gay term that related more to gendernonconformong and presented as a binary, she could tell.

I came out to a close friend at the end of last year. She's known me since kindergarten. At first, I asked her ""could you tell I was gay."" She said ""Well, it's not that I thought you were gay. I could just tell there was something else. Gay didnt fit it."" A couple minutes later I bashfully told her I thought I was non-binary. She responded along the lines of ""I never thought you were a [my sex]. You've always seemed to be something else.""

I told my best friend before I told her, and he responded with, ""Now that you put words to it, I dont think I've ever really seen you as [my sex]. That doesnt seem right at all.""

Mind you, all of my friends are cis and heterosexual. I find cis and heterosexual people have a harder time spotting non-cis people, but they know me pretty intimately. Something about people I'm close to reading me as *who i am* before i came out is deeply validating. That tells me who i am is *real* despite the prejudice and skepticism surrounding nonbinary.


I'm lucky to have an accepting friend group. They struggle with pronouns a lot because all of them have known me for at least 5 years. 

I am entering a new challenge now; I want to medically transition. In order to do that I have to have my parents support, but I'm highly skeptical of it going smoothly. I'm starting to see a gender therapist on thursday, and I scheduled said therapist under my parents' radar because they dont know that's what she does. I want-- actually I *need*-- to start HRT. I do want to be totally certain, however, of course and will benefit from a therapist helping me figure out what's right.

My dysphoria gets so bad that I struggle to sleep sometimes and I avoid going out as much as I'd like. The most I want to do for my medical transition is HRT and chest augmentation. I want a smaller chest, but I dont want it gone. This change will be far in the future, though.

This is just a post to put out there that I am an enby. I guess I'm 'coming out' to a community that I know will understand before telling anyone else.

I have been questioning my gender identity for a while but only began to veiw myself as trans after I realised that gender is fluid. Until now, I've always viewed gender as something that is constant and certain but I've realised I can just present as my ideal self, regardless of their gender (or lack of). This means, as of a couple of weeks ago, I am NonBinary.

For the majority of my life, I've never really liked labels, choosing not to label my sexuality even if it would fit within one: ""I like who I like. Isn't that enough?""
Anyway, after I came to that realisation, I began thinking, ""I wish I could do that with my gender as well as my sexuality,"" without realising that there was literally nothing stopping me from doing so. At first, I felt uncomfortable even with the label of 'NB' but I accepted it after I realised that it acts as an umbrella term for literally everything other than 'male' and 'female' of which I am neither.

I'm still far too scared to come out IRL. Based on discussions of gender we've had in the past, I don't think my friends or parents would understand and I think that they would think less of me for me being who I am. I have a couple of trans friends but for reasons I won't go into, I don't want to discuss it with them just yet. I do plan on presenting more femanine/androgynous depending on the day but I think I'll make do as my ""cis"" ""male"" self for now.

so i'd never really thought about my gender for a long time, and i'd just accepted that i was a cis guy. turned out im gay, and so for a while ive just been thinking of myself as a cis gay guy. but some time ago i saw something on twitter, it was like some kind of image with a few things including the gender spectrum on it, and the poster would like mark where they are on it and stuff. well i naturally got to thinking about where i'd put myself on it. and i was like, well i guess i'd be all the way at one end...but that didn't really feel right? 

i know that's kind of a silly thing to start thinking about this over, but it got me thinking about stuff i hadn't really before, and questioning a bit. like, i've always kinda disliked refering to myself by gendered pronouns. like, even as a kid i'd avoid referring to myself by them. like for example if i were ever to think something along the lines of ""i like x thing as much as any other guy"" it always just felt weird having the guy part there, and so i'd always just refer to myself as something gender neutral in my head.

i've also never really felt comfortable with my body, namely the more masculine looking stuff. up until like the end of highschool i didn't really care about how i looked at all. by which i mean i actually cared a lot, i just didn't do anything to effect my appearance, and just wore whatever was comfy. ive always really disliked seeing pictures of myself, and looking in the mirror and stuff. now i actually do care about my appearance, but as much as im a lot happier with how i look, every time i see myself it's like...idk, its hard to describe, but its not like i dislike how i look per se, but that what i look like just doesn't feel quite right? like, the image i have of myself in my head doesn't match with how i actually look, and it always kinda feels jarring looking at myself.

when i'd first seen the thing that got me questioning i kinda just dismissed the thought, but it always pops back up and i'd think about it more, every so often for months now. even so though, it was always kinda something on the back of my mind, like it wasn't something i felt too strongly about either way. but i thought about it again today and it was like...before id been looking a truck way off in the distance, and then suddenly today the truck was smashing into me. idk, it all just felt a lot...bigger i guess, than it had before. and even though i'd thought about it a bunch before, i'd never really thought of myself as being nonbinary, but i did this time and it just...made me feel really happy.

Mostly everyone has been cool and respects my they/them pronouns and I just don't fuck with the ones that aren't. 
I definitely definitely experience horrible dysphoria surrounding my own appearance and any time anyone brings up female anatomy, breasts, childbirth, just all of it makes my skin crawl.
 Being 5'1"" and afab I get misgendered all the time. But I have noticed when I get called ""sir"" or ""young man"" the way it makes me feel is completely opposite of when I get ""ma'am""d. The other night my roommate called me ""my dude"" and for whatever reason it made me feel so good. 
My name is v gender neutral but I think when people see me they still assume I'm female. I've been thinking about changing my gender marker and name, but I'm having serious doubts about what I want my name to be. My old username on tumblr was Vincent van ghost and I remember when randos would message me and call me Vincent I would feel v euphoric. At the time I remember thinking it was funny and kinda weird, but I didn't know I was trans. 

Anyway I'm just wondering if anyone else here has had to come out twice or if any of you also feel you lean strongly one way. I thought I identified as nonbinary because I knew I wasn't female but now I'm questioning shit again. The other thing is I don't know if my friends and family would be so accepting of me coming out a whole other time. And my boyfriend of five years who I love very much might not be so understanding.

So I'm biologically a girl and I've never minded when people say I'm a girl or had any kind of dysphoria.
But I read a comic a while ago where the people could change their gender at any time until they were 20 and I realised that I wouldn't want to choose. I've been thinking about it a lot since then and have realised that I don't care what gender people see me as and which pronouns they use. Some days I feel more comfortable dressing and acting like a girl, most of the time I feel more comfortable being more manly and wearing men's clothing but even on those days I don't really mind she/her pronouns.
I have a very feminine body (small, curvy), so even in men's clothing I don't pass as a man (maybe if I wore a binder idk) and I sometimes wish I had a more androgynous body, so I could also pass as a man.
My boyfriend is also completely straight and I'm a little afraid that he wouldn't like it if I identified as nonbinary, so I don't know if I don't want to identify as nb because it frightens me?
Currently I'm just telling people who ask that I don't really care about gender but I kind off want to put a label on it so I can deal with it more easily. 

So this was kind of a long rant üòÖ. Has anyone of you been in a similar situation or has any advice on how to deal with this and come to a conclusion?

&amp;#x200B;

**Tangled gentlethem**   
^(- written and read, by Werevulvi (me))

""My life in extremes, an abundance of dysphoria growing fraught  
I dithered disoriented between the sexes, tangled and distraught  
until I could no more  
deny my androgyny galore

For I am a thousand times happier when I'm hated for my true face  
than when I carve myself bloody to blend into a marketplace  
Ask me once and I will tell you twice  
about all the things that you unfairly judge, and don't even realise

My hairy hourglass figure so beautiful in a vintage dress  
My dark red lips framed by a beard, with a deep voice to tell you,   
that there is nothing to confess  
Because I'm not the one in hiding  
from the injustice that you're abiding

I am both a woman and a man,   
all of your fantasies and fears combined  
A sore look for some, while for others, hopes of a future better   
than the past they left behind  
But who am I for me?  
What is it that I in the mirror see?

I feel my lesbian heart, warm in a man's chest  
I see my invisible womanhood, which I'm denied in jest  
I hear my feminine mind, spoken with a male voice  
oh, what I am,   
is a tangled gentlethem who made a very difficult choice

What I experience is what I know  
an end-destination of a journey that I'm hesitant to show  
Oh, what can I do, play pretend and dare say,  
that I'm a legendary hermaphroditic hearsay?

What I call myself may not be entirely true in science  
but it's my shield of tricks, in defence and defiance  
Oh, make of it what you wish  
I'm just a little niche

I may seem confident but I am scared, ashamed and insecure  
Oh, but oh, I know for certain and I am sure  
that what I love about my body, is not what I ought  
Beyond rhyme and reason,   
it was always androgyny galore, that I sought""",NonBinary,"A poem I wrote about my nonbinary experience, and link to me reading it aloud",1580931601.0,"{'created_utc': 1580906401, 'id': 'ez8ywh', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'I thought I\'d share a poem that I wrote about my experience in the world as a nonbinary person.

i‚Äôm looking for a gender neutral enby name and i‚Äôm having trouble finding one that i connect with. i‚Äôd love some advice and experiences in general on how you found your names! 

some more about myself: 
i just realized that i identify as nb and with that i realized i want to change my name too for several reasons but mostly i don‚Äôt like my name letting people think falsely about me. 
i‚Äôm pretty feminine leaning but i don‚Äôt want my name to be, also i‚Äôd very much like a name that‚Äôs not really a name?
i am a soft person but i can also be very fierce, i‚Äôm also really creative and i love to make art of all kinds. 
if it matters, i have long silver-ish hair and i am often told i look like an elf which i think is cute (:

some previous name suggestions were river, eden or robin which i all really like but sadly i don‚Äôt really connect to them. it kind of feels wrong naming myself so i hope to find a name that just feels natural..

2020-02-06 12:52:58,ezrxnf,6,1,"Fair evening everyone,

it seems that any time I look for nonbinary fashion blogs or pages online, I find exclusively sites promoting gender neutral fashion lines. Thing is, these are extremely expensive and don't really fit an everyday style anyway.

Frankly I find these very exclusionary. Many NB people are working class trans people who simply cannot afford these big-line pinkwashed clothing lines.

2020-02-06 14:48:04,eztcl9,22,1,"So something that needs more explanation is dysphoria as a non-binary and how weird it is compared with binary dysphoria. The weirdness actually supports non-binary trans people as real and different from binary and cis people.

There are different types of dysphoria!

Body dysphoria
Social dysphoria
Mental dysphoria
Clothing dysphoria

Body dysphoria has to do with your body. The shape, the fat distribution (yes you can dislike fat and have it be dysphoria, as far distribution is a secondary sex characteristic), hair, face shape, genitals, even how you smell and sound. It's what most people are referring to when they talk about dysphoria.

Social dysphoria has to do with presentation of yourself, your self awareness, and others' awareness of you. Being treated as a particular gender, being expected to be a certain way, having certain characteristics, or even just how people decode you to fit into a certain category can all contribute to this type of dysphoria.

Mental dysphoria more has to do with how your brain works. How does it process yourself? How does it compare you? Are you thinking like the gender you identify as or are you thinking differently? How do your emotions work? How do you socialize with people? Hormone therapy changes one's emotional state. It causes your brain to think a certain way. That may still be a spectrum and not everyone has to think and process the same way as someone the same gender as them, but hormones still have an effect on an individual's psychology. It's why hormones are so effecting on binary trans people. It helps their brains work more like the gender they identify as and helps them see themselves more as the gender they identify with.

Clothing dysphoria is like, one type of outfit fits you a certain way, shows off or hides certain parts, or identifies you in a way that doesn't match you and leads your brain to label you as the wrong gender. Not everyone has this dysphoria and that's perfectly valid.

You can have any combination of these applied to any combination of things or lack thereof and be trans. But if you don't have a problem with identifying yourself to yourself as your birth gender, you are not trans. It's about how you feel about yourself when no one is around, first.",NonBinary,Dysphoria Being Enby,1581025684.0,"{'created_utc': 1581000484, 'id': 'eztcl9', 'num_comments': 22, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""So something that needs more explanation is dysphoria as a non-binary and how weird it is compared with binary dysphoria.

2020-02-06 16:41:39,ezuy7q,4,1,"Hello! I just found this subreddit recently and it seems like a good place to post about my name dysphoria blues. 

I have a very unique legal name which I will not share here, but I can't remember ever liking it. People always butchered it and still do, and even as a kid, I started using a nickname my friends gave me based on a character I used, and adults used to scold me for asking to be called that. People are always fawning over how ""purty"" and ""unique"" it is and it just makes me sick. It's too long, and most of all, it's too feminine and not a reflection of me at all. I can't stand looking at it and it really sours my mood every time I have to look at it. 

Job hunting is a nightmare because I can't use a nickname. I literally had to straight up give up job hunting because it distresses me so much.

Everyone at work calls me by my nickname, but there's still those assholes who look at my name on the schedule and then cue the ""Oh but that's COOL why don't you use IT"" And even worse, when they actually do and I have to tell them ""No, don't call me that""

I feel especially sick when people call it ""beautiful"" because that term is just so gendered (at least it always has been when people used it on me; I know it's lost most of its gender connotation and I'm thankful for that) and it was constantly force-fed to me as a kid.

My mom knows how much I've always hated it but every time it gets brought up she just gets this big smile and goes ""But *I* think it's beautiful!"" She told me she and my dad didn't even consider other names when naming me.

**However, it will plague me no longer, because I am taking the plunge and changing it.**

My fiance (who though cishet, is very accepting of my identity) is supportive of my decision because he knows how long I've toiled over this, and I've chosen a new name. It's similar, but it's shorter, easier, and sounds more masculine without being too much so. My boss has said ""but it sounds like a boy's name!"" and I said ""it's not a boy's name. It's my name. I picked it, and it spoke to me.""

I have come out to most of my family as nonbinary, and most of them have been accepting even if they don't fully understand. The only one who hasn't is my mom who thinks I'm ""gender confused"" but she's basically the only one.

My fiance and I have had fun with wedding planning, but for me, my name dysphoria has sucked a lot of fun out of it, but I know my family won't recognize my chosen name if I put it on the invites. So, instead, I'm resolving that the last time anyone will see my deadname (it's dead in my heart) will be on my wedding invites. I don't know who she was ever supposed to be, but she isn't me, and this will be my most radical act of owning my identity!

2020-02-06 19:47:58,ezxt6v,9,1,"I guess I have a lot of questions on identity and am working on developing and describing my identity so I feel more comfortable with people.

About me: 27yo AFAB NB- pretty agender. coming to this identity has been a long process for me. Having a history of eating disorders has really complicated this as well as having a history of abuse by men. It has really been over the past 3 years that I have started to interpret my feelings about my body and how i would like to be perceived through the lens of gender. During that time I have started to present more masculine and wear binders a lot of the time. I can identify with the experience of womanhood, as I have spent 24 years of my life living exclusively as a woman and have experienced and continue to experience many of the struggles women experience- so being referred to with she/her pronouns doesn't bother me, it just feels not true. like people using them are not describing me with precise language.

 Over-all, It has been going really well and I have been presenting myself in a way that helps me to feel more confident and comfortable in my own skin and not be *worrying* about how I look all. the. time. Its been great. And I want to continue this greatness. I have talked about my feelings and how I have come to view my identity with my partner and some friends. I want to continue feeling comfortable to come out to people but what keeps coming up is people asking if I am trans.

Me and trans identity: I don't identify as trans. I don't plan on going on hormones or getting surgery. I follow a lot of trans you tubers (if you haven't seen jammidoger check him out, for NB contentcreators I'm v into luxander). alone in a vacuum me and my body have a good truce and I love how i look with clothes and a binder on, I feel like I look pretty close to how I picture myself in my head then. But I don't know if I will ever feel better about my naked body than I do now (which is basically neutral- identifying that it has a degree of aesthetic appeal but is not how I view myself). I have always seen myself as looking neutral and when I was identifying as a woman this caused me a lot of stress and made me feel like I will never meet the expectations of womanhood and after I learned there were other ways to live it made me question if I even wanted to meet the woman expectations. If I was AMAB I think I would feel pretty similarly about it both socially and physically- I wouldn't want facial hair or to be very muscular or to have a very deep voice. I just want to be super neutral. In my head I am super neutral.

Additionally, viewing my body as intrinsically something non-binary as I, the owner of the body, am non-binary has made me feel way less uncomfortable about it.

In short- are my feelings similar to those of people who are NB and identify as trans? Does it seem like my reluctance to identify as trans is related to some sort of internalized transphobia? Any advice or perspective appreciated.

Charlie gets very dysphoric, and doesn't really want to go by any pronouns whatsoever, hence why I'm referring to ""Charlie"" that way instead of using pronouns.

 I had green hair and he told me I needed to dye it before the interview and I got it dyed a white color and got it cut super short (I'm AFAB) so he's been harassing me about it saying how ""you're fucking stupid, you look like a little boy, you look like an ugly butch"" and I'm starting to get scared. He already was angry at me because I wanted to wear a pant suit which he thought was horrible but he eventually let me get one (it had to be a womans one of course).

It's been difficult, somewhat because of my habits and somewhat because of antidepressant side effects.

BUT something changed this week. I usually hide under a vest or a hoodie, but didn't feel the need to do that this week. 

Previously, I was uncomfortable with how I Iooked with a binder over a DD chest and stomach - the way stuff ended up arranged made shirts look weird. I've lost enough weight that my silhouette looks more natural/smooth/whatever.

I got dressed for work on Monday and had a feeling similar to putting on a binder for the first time: understanding what people mean when they ""feel good"" in certain clothes. I even took a (very rare) selfie. 

I posted about weight and dysphoria a while ago and there seemed to be a handful of folks who have similar struggles and feelings. If it helps, I am working with a nutritionist whose most helpful tactics are:

-- take photos of everything you eat. I have to upload these to a shared drive for her so she gets a sense of my day to day patterns. But I've found that accountability useful so I sent the shared drive to a few friends as well

-- more fiber. Most people don't get nearly enough fiber apparently. Fiber by way of fruit is good for the sweet tooth

-- when possible, make your own food/avoid processed food. If processed, check the sugar and cholesterol before buying. Frozen fruits and vegetables are ok. 

‚Äî I found the first week of refocusing my sweet tooth toward fruit was really difficult but has made actual sweets taste TOO sweet. (I have been eating a boatload of apples with peanut NBC butter) 

That all said, none of the tips are anything I haven‚Äôt heard before. It‚Äôs possible that this is just the first time I was 100% dedicated to doing it. 

I also already very little meat and dairy, which is probably advantageous. Plus, I changed my antidepressants to something more weight neutral. 

Regardless, I hope you find it useful.",NonBinary,Losing weight... finally,1581109935.0,"{'created_utc': 1581084735, 'id': 'f0b092', 'num_comments': 4, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'I\'ve been working very hard to lose weight to 1. feel less uncomfortable in my body and 2. get to an ideal weight for potential top surgery.\n\nIt\'s been difficult, somewhat because of my habits and somewhat because of antidepressant side effects.\n\nBUT something changed this week.

 My periods are terrible because I have endo, but there's nothing I can do to stop the pain. Over the counter medications don't do much, but, because of my age and my parent's and sister's history with abusing pills, no doctor here will prescribe me anything that could actually help. It's so unfair that I have to exist in so much pain because of age and other people. 

My doctor compared the pain I experience to labor pains but he told me the best way to deal with it is it work out during my period and stay hydrated. HOW CAN I WORK OUT IF I CAN'T EVEN WALK YOU DAMN CIS MAN? WOULD YOU TELL SOMEONE IN LABOR TO WORK OUT TO HELP THEIR PAIN? NO, YOU WOULDN'T! 

I wish I could stay home from school and take off of work, but my grades are starting to fall a little and if I take off even one day I won't be able to afford groceries because my job hates queer people and gives me limited hours on the worst shift. 

Why can't my soul exist outside of my body? All I want to do is watch Disney movies, eat pizza, and cry. But I can't even do that because I'm poor and stuck in a school with people who bully me for everything and crying would make them bully me more. I never thought I would say this, but I think I may regret being emancipated. Yeah my parents were horrible people and were homophobic, but at least I could take off of school without worrying if I was going to starve or not and I could order a pizza if they got drunk enough.

Life is so hard and I hate it so much.

I hate everything. I hate myself. I hate my body. I hate this stupid chest and this stupid part of my body that has to bleed every month. I hate that sometimes it bleeds for weeks at a time.

I can't talk to my friends because we're in school and I can't talk to them tonight because I'm working and I don't know how I'm going to work my first full shift in two weeks while I'm in so much pain.

2020-02-07 22:52:15,f0ifvt,5,1,"cn: potentially problematic opinions from me about enby-exclusion in dating? 

Hi!

I've been questioniing my gender recently and started to identify as nonbinary. It's not me, but it's a significant part of me.

I'm not out. I've told a few close friends and am considering coming out on coming out day. I gender-present as feels right for me, which I feel is enough. I'm not hiding, just blending into cis-normativity.

Something really awkward happened recently.

Polite request - please don't criticise her. She wasn't being malicious. She was wrong to assume my gender but like.... that's what everyone does. I don't expect perfection from cis people.

Anyway yeah.

I was on a first date and it was going well then the person says ""is it bad that I've only been attracted to very binary people? I feel like I'm not attracted to nonbinary people"".

Now, she fancies me, so I know that's not true. Equally, ://///////////////////////// So awkward.

I didn't know what to do, so I just continued the date as if she hadn't said it.

She said she'd think it was problematic to stop being attracted to someone once she finds out they're nonbinary - it seemed more like unconscious bias \*maybe\*. She's a nice person, I think she'd be mortified if she knew I was enby, and wouldn't blame me (so like, I don't think she'll accuse me of lying).

Equally though, I actually disagree that it'd be wrong to stop being attracted to me. For me at least, gender identity does matter, bc it impacts how you perceive the other person and also relationship dynamics. That's not to say ruling out nonbinary people is okay (if you have a conscious rule I think that's dodgy), just that if you want a fixed/binary set of gender roles in the relationship, you might not be compatible with me. If she's seeing me as ""a girl"" and couldn't be attracted to me as ""an enby"", I'd rather know now and avoid hurt / wasted time.

I don't usually feel a need to lead with gender identity (though this is quite new). I feel like if I just express myself then people will see me for me, to the point where it's not even surprising if I tell them I'm enby.

But in this specific context, she obviously thinks I'm cis - like actively assumes it, otherwise why would she say that to me???

I guess I'm asking for advice/solidarity. Has anyone been in this position before? How did you handle and recommend handling it??

I don't feel I owe her coming out. It's on her if she assumes I'm cis. I guess just more for myself, this needs addressing, it's gonna be hanging over my head, and it's stressful if she sees me as something I'm not.:(

I don't feel inclined to end things yet. I think it's still salvageable. She likes me and she made a blunder, doesn't have to be a dealbreaker I think.

I don‚Äôt really know how to get into this so I‚Äôll post what I have the capacity for and can clarify if people have questions/any support on how to navigate this.

I‚Äôve identified as nonbinary (AFAB) for many years now, I present as masc. My girlfriend and I are currently monog but have talked about how she has always felt the need to have a masc and femme dynamic in her life, this convo has always been regarding sex. She has been polyam for the past 5 years, I was monog with another partner before her and we entered into a monog relationship a couple months into dating. She primarily dated men but also dated cis women. This relationship has been interesting in that it has brought up a few feelings for myself due to it starting off as a pretty intense masc-femme dynamic, unlike I have ever experienced before. So this concept that she needs a femme sexual dynamic has felt uncomfortable for me as it brings up feelings of gender which I didn‚Äôt really think about before.

2020-02-08 05:55:29,f0nhc6,1,1,"I just wanted to get this out, so bare with me.

About a month ago, I started seriously questioning my gender. I'm AFAB, but never felt comfortable with the demale parts of the body. I never wanted the chest or the big hips that generally come with being born female. I felt really uncomfortable and selfconsious about my hair for my whole life. The only time I actually felt confident with it was two years ago when I did my first major cut to about my chin. Then, about 3 or 4 months ago, I learned about Nonbinary peeps. My family is very LDS (but I don't have the energy to explain that, so if you know what I'm talking about, YAY!) and hid me from the whole LGBTQ+ community until I learned from a friend what gay was and started talking to my parents about it.
 
After about a month and a half of knowing what nonbinary was, I started realizing that I might be in the spectrum due to past experiences (most mentionwd above) and started slightly questioning. After about 2-3 weeks, I accepted that I was at least bigender (female and enby) and asked my closest friend to try to start calling me Phoenix, a name that I've been extremely attached to for as long as I cam remember. After aboit a week, I realized yet agajn that I was more nonbinary than anything else, so I started to identify as a Nonbinary human being. During this, I've also learned that I'm a Panromantic whose also somewhere on the asexual spectrum.

Now, I've been saving up for a binder due to daily disphoria directed to my chest and have reached 87 dollars already (saving for 50 to get a $50 Visa gift card from Wal-Mart to buy one off of gc2b). I've also finally convinced my dad to let me cut my hair and got that done earlier this evening. Tomorrow, I'm going shopping for my gift card, and something as an award for being who I am inside and out. I've also relaized how quickly I'm jumling into this, bit also know that I tend to learn myself very quickly and can realize the best things for me quicker than most can expect. 

Now, onto the problem if my parents... As I've mentioned, my whole family is very LDS, and that church teaches that only binary genders exists (which has been scientifically proven incorrect) and it's wrong to be trans. It also teaches against anyone in the LGBTQ+ community. I've recently discovered I'm a pagan witch in addition to a Nonbinary Panromantic Asexual hooman who is definently not anything near Christian. If I told any of this to anyone in my family, though, I don't believe I would be safe at all. I've noticed the homophobia and transphobia around me and that scares me. I have signs of my witch craft around the house (only small ones, though, I know what to hide well) and the reactions they get aren't usually the best.

Today, when I cut my hair, my mom (who had taken me) had immediatly said that dad was worried that I got it because of the groups I was hanging around (which are really nice, great people who just so happen to all be apart of the LGBTQ community, but the fam doesn't know that) and the first thought i got was that he thinks I might be becoming trans because if the people I hang around or jist extremely rebellious. It hurt because I thought I might have had a chance at feeling like I would be accepted and supported in my house without actually coming out.

So anyways, if you've gotten this far, thanks for listening and hope you have a great weekend or week depending on when you see this!

‚Ä¢ is non binary a third gender or is it lack of gender? 

‚Ä¢ what sexuality would a non binary person be if a NB person liked  a Male would that be a straight relationship, as it‚Äôs with 2 different genders? 

‚Ä¢i‚Äôm aware that gender and sex are totally different but i‚Äôm wondering how many genders are there, do there sort of come under the ‚Äúmain ones‚Äù that is (male female non binary??) or do they all class as totally different? 

‚Ä¢ i understand that this is non binary group and this question is about being gender fluid so sorry! but with gender fluid is it that, you identify as both male female non binary (ectra) at the same time or is it that some times u identify as male, and then sometimes female, then non binary (ectra &lt;i‚Äôm rlly sorry i don‚Äôt know the names for the rest!&gt; )

hey everyone!

lately I've been having a name crisis of sorts

my given name, almost no one calls me it. it's a SUPER femme name. Most call me a gender neutral nickname that is close to my birth name and I've been called this name since as long as I can remember. Funny how things worked out!

the problem is I kinda want to change it? Like I want to legally have a gender neutral name. 

I know it's a stereotype for enby folks to have weird a** names but over the course of this past year I've been thinking about asking people to call me Frizz or something similar. I don't really know what yet. 

I like the name frizz because it's very me (I have wild curly hair) but I also worry about perception in a professional setting where I probably won't be taken seriously from the get go because of my gender. In addition, my family is latinx and I have no idea how they would say that name LOL. I just have lots of worries and insecurities 

I also am wondering if I just want to change my name due to its relationship to a family member who physically and emotionally abused me as a teenager. I worry that as I progress through therapy I'll regret asking people to call me something different. I dunno.

Any input would be great! Also name suggestions if you want lol! 

If you need a description: I have short dark curly hair (that I'll probably grow out more) and lighter skin. My face is kinda heart shaped and I have big ol glasses. I dress like a cartoony kindergarten teacher OR a librarian. not much in between there (the occasional punk look sprinkled about).

She has always said she supports me, but has honestly done nothing to prove it, seems to mostly pretend I am not '''the way i am''' and always says things like 'but you dont really know who you are yet'. She never refers to me correctly, either.

Hi folks. I'm a Twitch creative streamer who has found a very open and accepting community that is LGBTQIA+ friendly. Let me share a story from last night.

A guy came in and asked the obligatory ""are you a guy or a girl"". I told him I'm agender. ""If you're a gender what gender is it??"" Sigh. So I corrected him on his spelling. Then I got the big question that we all hate:

""What genitals do you have?""

Are you serious?  They asked what genitals I have, they wanted to see my birth certificate, and asked if I shave my beard daily. Dude, I'm not about to give some internet rando my personal information. They could not for the life of me understand that its rude to ask people about their genitals, as if it was public domain. ""Its the same as asking your name"". Seriously?? No. 

A mod popped in and banned him. I don't get how someone can equate asking if you have a penis to asking for your name. They could NOT for the life of me understand public vs personal space. Thankfully, its the first real troll I've had in the near-3-years I've been streaming.

Some people are getting it pretty well, but one person I know, who is from an older generation, has a really REALLY hard time remembering. They get it right about...1% of the time and almost never correct themselves. I know they don't mean it intentionally. They're a very kind person, and I think very highly of them. But since my dysphoria has been getting a lot worse lately and I'm in meetings with this person every week, it's been painful to be called the wrong pronouns over and over again. Since they weren't correcting themselves, I thought that maybe they had forgotten, so, after the weekly meeting, I texted them and said I know they don't do it on purpose, but I just wanted to give them a nudge about calling me they/them, especially since we have weekly meetings now. I also asked if there were any ways for me to make it easier for them to remember/help them get used to using they/them.

The next day I got a mini-essay back from them saying they weren't really sure how to respond to this, a lot of statements about how they're from an older generation and that nb pronouns weren't around when they grew up. They said they knew they used the wrong pronouns for me in the meeting and felt terrible about it. They said they didn't understand my point about it being more important since we have weekly meetings since everyone in the meeting knows my pronouns and the pronouns of the other nb person. They said, for what it was worth, when I left the meeting later on, they corrected someone who called me she/her. Conclusion was, they said they were afraid I'd just have to be patient with them.   


They definitely didn't sound really angry, but it felt like a strange response and it did aggravate me. It was through text, so I can't tell their tone for sure, but it felt like they felt I was putting them on the defensive, even though I had actually said in my message that I wasn't angry or anything. It was also annoying having sort of...excuses thrown at me? I understand why it's hard for them to remember, but it just made me feel crappy about even approaching them. I know they probably thought that saying they felt terrible for making mistakes would make me feel better but it...just makes me feel like I'm an annoyance. Overall, it just felt like they were trying to prove ""no no no!! I'm an ally! I understand!"" when all I was doing was seeing if they needed a reminder. Especially since they were basically trying to use specific examples of when they've corrected people (which I didn't know about) to defend themselves. It's not the response I wanted to elicit at all. I just wanted to know if they needed a reminder.  


I answered backing saying, yeah I get all of that, I just wanted to open the floor for discussion on whether they needed a reminder.

I decided tonight on the name Oliver, which I‚Äôve been testing out and messing around with for about 2-3 years.

It gives me such gender euphoria and it feels so right.

But, I‚Äôve already changed my name once, and people have just gotten comfortable with River. I have no issues being called River. Its still gender affirming.

I want this to be easy for people, at least while
I‚Äôm in school. My closest friends can switch just fine. I‚Äôve had other trans/enby/others who changed names multiple times. I know people do it, I‚Äôm just really scared to.

I've identified as a trans man for roughly 3 and half years and for the most part I've been happier than I've ever been but in a very complicated way. Specific changes have made me a lot happier -- going on testosterone and having a deeper voice and a masculinized hairline and leg hair, getting top surgery, etc. Some changes I didn't care about (body hair). I got most of my documents changed to a masculine name and male gender marker and I've used he/him pronouns for 3.5 years without a fuss.

So I've decreased a lot of my dysphoria related to being read as strictly female, but in the process I think I've gained some dysphoria related to being read as strictly male. It feels a lot like how I felt before coming out as trans albeit to a lesser degree, and I've been really afraid to explore this because in the back of my head was this worry that I'd be a detransitioner or something. In the last couple months I've been considering that I might be nb. I've asked some of my friends to use my (gender neutral) chosen middle name and they/them pronouns and it feels nice.

What's confusing me is a lot of the specifics about how I'm feeling right now. I identify with transmasculinity and have had several surgeries and am seeking bottom surgery, but I've also been relating to and identifying with butch lesbians a lot more now than I ever did when I thought I was a cis woman. I don't identify as a woman, but there's a part of me that goes ""that's me"" when I see posts about butch women. I've been toying with the idea of going off testosterone for a more gender neutral look, and right now I really want to look like a blurred line between gnc woman and transmasculine.

I did do a search before I posted but most of the questions were about how people are going now that they are on hormones, not how they actually started on them and what their experiences of doing that was like.

I'm not NB but I am curious what the process for NB peoples is if they wish to take hormones. I am reasonably informed about how the process works for trans individuals but am curious about the differences (and struggles) NB peoples may face -- e.g., to what extent do you come up against resistance from health professionals; was it a struggle to find a source for hormones; what hoops (if any) did you have to jump through to firstly gain and then maintain your source of hormones? Am I even on the right track assuming you face unique difficulties in this area?

My assumption, hence why I'm asking, is that depending on your location you may have to have a diagnosis from a health professional. Is this experience harder for NB people than trans people (i.e. does the medical world keenly acknowledge and support the goals of NB folks)? Or is informed consent more of the norm these days, so there is less justification and hoops needed to jump through?

I can't bear to be stuck in this house any longer , but I'm afraid to ride my bike (my only means of transportation) because what if i get even more bottom heavy?? I'm afraid to stop losing weight because the only time the edges of my body felt right were when my BMI was 15.4, but I know I don't have to go there again if I can gain muscle... but I'm afraid to eat enough to do that.

Informed consent isn't an option for me (no one does it nearby), so here's what I need to do:

* I need to call the insurance company and ask if they cover HRT for trans people. I know they cover GCS according to the online listings but I want to be sure
* I need to talk to my therapist. She doesn't know much about trans issues and we keep winding up talking about it anyway because lots of problems are caused by dysphoria, so she found another therapist who uses the same technique(?) that she does who specializes in LGBTQ issues. So I need to ask her how to go about getting the diagnosis of gender dysphoria and letter of recommendation that the insurance needs (for gcs and probably for hrt too if they cover it). Like, can I see him just for this, or do I have to switch to him for a bit? Because I do like her. 
* I need to see my psychiatrist. I don't have another doctor, so I need her to refer me to an endocrinologist (actually, let me ask the insurance company if I need a referral for that.)

The only catch here is that telling the insurance company might somehow fuck this up for me? I've heard trans people say they don't tell the insurance company and get it listed as other conditions, but I have other pre existing conditions so I probably can't make it worse at this point. The only hard part here is that I allegedly have bipolar, and I want my meds changed because they're giving me prediabetes and diabetes can disqualify me from top surgery (also diabetes is a terrifying disease in its own right). So someone could try to make the argument that it's uncontrolled.

So I call tomorrow and ask if they cover HRT and who can prescribe it and do I need a referral for them amd what I need to have it covered, talk to therapist on Thursday, make next moves Friday. Fuck I'm dying.

2020-02-12 02:07:39,f2jkiu,1,1,"Hey guys! My name is Mary Rose (currently) and I'm AFAB. However, recently I've been having a lot of questions about my gender identity. I feel incredibly comfortable and happy in traditionally male clothes including boxers and tight sports bras, but I also don't mind dressing up in feminine attire once in a while. That being said, incredibly feminine clothing (such as incredibly bright pink and purple stuff) makes me incredibly uncomfortable and out of place. I prefer baggy clothes and jeans and have always been more comfortable in the presence of guys. (I go to a boarding school and would much rather be in a guys house than my current female house) I also wouldn't mind if someone called me they/them or he/him, but I'm not in an accepting environment for that... especially if I'm going to be questioning my identity. My family and fellow high schoolers are already having immense difficulty acknowledging my sexuality (I currently identify as a lesbian), but at least they acknowledge lesbians exist. My parents strictly believe in a strictly set god-given gender binary, and that while emotions exist they feel like you can't change how you're born. I'm incredibly confused and it is not helping my mental health at all. I have absolutely no one to confide in or trust about this gender identity thing.

&amp;#x200B;

BTW I was just wondering if I could maybe pass as NB or if I just look like a butch lesbian:

So, I‚Äôve been out as nonbinary for about three months to myself, and I‚Äôve been out to people for about two. I am still having a lot of doubt and concern about myself, because the last thing I want to do is prove those ‚Äòit‚Äôs just a phase‚Äô people right. I am fairly confident that I am nonbinary, but no one seems to believe me, making my personal doubt worse by proxy. I am still constantly being misgendered and dead named at school, not to mention by my mom who feels like I should embrace my femininity more.

My mom is the worst case though, because she worries that this is just a phase brought on by previous sexual trauma, as I was molested as a child. She believes that I am denying my femininity in order to distance myself from sexuality, which honestly couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. She has begun threatening to ground me from socializing and electronic access if I keep binding, so I‚Äôve begun taking off my binding layers before coming home, as she checks me for compressive layers. She constantly dead names me and it is getting really annoying, and I feel like everyone thinks I‚Äôm lying or doing it for attention.

No one seems to support or believe me, except my very close friend Jack, who I see very rarely. I am trying to look as androgynous as possible, but it seems like none of my efforts do anything, because everyone just gets more upset at me trying to look it.

When I was looking for information it was pretty scarce, so I hope this can eventually help someone. :)

I went to the Charlottesville Planned Parenthood in Virginia. I made an appointment online which was super simple, the only negative thing about that avenue is that they make you use your legal name for the appointment, don't ask for pronouns, and also make you choose between ""female"" or ""male"" as your options for gender. That did initially scare me when I made the appointment, but I decided to go through with it and see what the actual day would bring. As for the reason for my appointment, I chose ""transgender hormone therapy"" from the list of options.

The day of the appointment I went in and the intake people asked me a few questions, and one of these questions was my preferred name. I told them and they wrote it atop my patient info and I was called that from then on. The intake people were super nice and friendly and could probably tell I was nervous as hell. The doctor came out very quickly and called me in, they were young and chill and we talked a bit and then I had to do a urine sample before going into the room. 

They (I'm using neutral pronouns here for the doctor because I'm not sure) began by asking me some questions: how I would label my gender identity (I said, after a bit of internal monologue about how complicated this was, ""I just use nonbinary"" and they replied ""That's a great umbrella term""), my pronouns, which I said are they/them, my sexual history, allergies/medications, etc. They gave me a booklet of effects of testosterone and likely timelines for those effects, and then they went down to get my partner so they could sit with us. 

With them in the room we started going over more in depth questions, though they prefaced this by saying that my answers would not determine whether or not I would be given hormones, and that they were more for guidance reasons. They asked about my desired effects, what goals I had, what I was afraid or unsure about, how long I'd been thinking about this, how long I'd been inwardly/outwardly living as nonbinary, my support systems, etc. They were extremely respectful and chill the whole time and I felt like they really wanted to help and give me the proper guidance. I never felt judged or like I was on trial or like I had to prove myself, which was something I was super scared of especially as a nonbinary person. 

They had me do a finger prick to test my hemoglobin or something (lol) but other than that they didn't make me take any hormone tests because they said the way that they judge things is by meeting up with me every three months at first to see if I'm getting to the results I want and adjusting my dosage. They started me on .25 ml/week, which . So I didn't have any blood work done, just a finger prick and a urine sample and that was it. I got my prescription for .25 ml/week that day and was able to pick it up at a CVS down the street in about two hours.

Overall it was an amazing experience and I'm so glad I finally had the courage to do it. I hate going to the doctor and I was especially terrified of this because of the subject matter and feeling so exposed and vulnerable to them, but every doctor and person I interacted with was so respectful and engaged and excited to help me. I really thought I would not be able to start T whatsoever, and I was able to begin in one day.

I made an appointment online which was super simple, the only negative thing about that avenue is that they make you use your legal name for the appointment, don\'t ask for pronouns, and also make you choose between ""female"" or ""male"" as your options for gender. That did initially scare me when I made the appointment, but I decided to go through with it and see what the actual day would bring. As for the reason for my appointment, I chose ""transgender hormone therapy"" from the list of options.\n\nThe day of the appointment I went in and the intake people asked me a few questions, and one of these questions was my preferred name. I told them and they wrote it atop my patient info and I was called that from then on. The intake people were super nice and friendly and could probably tell I was nervous as hell. The doctor came out very quickly and called me in, they were young and chill and we talked a bit and then I had to do a urine sample before going into the room.\n\nThey (I\'m using neutral pronouns here for the doctor because I\'m not sure) began by asking me some questions: how I would label my gender identity (I said, after a bit of internal monologue about how complicated this was, ""I just use nonbinary"" and they replied ""That\'s a great umbrella term""), my pronouns, which I said are they/them, my sexual history, allergies/medications, etc. They gave me a booklet of effects of testosterone and likely timelines for those effects, and then they went down to get my partner so they could sit with us.\n\nWith them in the room we started going over more in depth questions, though they prefaced this by saying that my answers would not determine whether or not I would be given hormones, and that they were more for guidance reasons. They asked about my desired effects, what goals I had, what I was afraid or unsure about, how long I\'d been thinking about this, how long I\'d been inwardly/outwardly living as nonbinary, my support systems, etc. They were extremely respectful and chill the whole time and I felt like they really wanted to help and give me the proper guidance. I never felt judged or like I was on trial or like I had to prove myself, which was something I was super scared of especially as a nonbinary person.\n\nThey had me do a finger prick to test my hemoglobin or something (lol) but other than that they didn\'t make me take any hormone tests because they said the way that they judge things is by meeting up with me every three months at first to see if I\'m getting to the results I want and adjusting my dosage. They started me on .25 ml/week, which . So I didn\'t have any blood work done, just a finger prick and a urine sample and that was it. I got my prescription for .25 ml/week that day and was able to pick it up at a CVS down the street in about two hours.\n\nOverall it was an amazing experience and I\'m so glad I finally had the courage to do it. I hate going to the doctor and I was especially terrified of this because of the subject matter and feeling so exposed and vulnerable to them, but every doctor and person I interacted with was so respectful and engaged and excited to help me. I really thought I would not be able to start T whatsoever, and I was able to begin in one day. I just did my first shot by myself and I\'m so thrilled to finally after 6+ years of wondering, be able to do this. To anyone on the fence about Planned Parenthood or informed consent, I highly recommend.\n\nHope this helps some other anxious bean down the road :)', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'My Experience Starting T at Planned Parenthood', 'created': 1581584280.0}"

So I'm AMAB, 21, and a few months back, I had the realization that I didn't really want to be a man. I didn't feel like a man, and I didn't really want to be one. And, I realized, I didn't really feel like/want to be a woman either. I didn't really want to deal with the implications of that at the time, as I had other things going on in my life back then, so I just pushed that aside for awhile, but now a few months later the question has returned. 

It's been something of a crazy week, now that this is on my mind. I've been doing a lot of googling on this issue, trying to figure out what I am, how people's experiences compare to mine, etc. And I stumbled upon this subreddit. It's a little weird how much people's experiences here line up with mine. Like, for a while I've been fascinated by the LGBTQ+ community. I like to come up with stories/write a lot, and a lot of my stories tend to be about LGBTQ+ issues. Same with gender. For a while now, I've believed that the gender binary is silly (from both a philosophical and a practical point of view) but I'd never considered doing something about it. I'd never thought that maybe I was letting gender limit myself in some way. I'd never noticed. But now I do, and I'm starting to feel uncomfortable with people gendering me, by calling me ""sir,"" or ""he,"" or when my parents refer to me as their ""son.""

I‚Äôve been with my cishet male partner for two years in July, and before we even got together, I told him that I was nonbinary and pan.

I even cosplayed Haruka in their Mugen school uniform. 

I also told him that I wanted my they/them pronouns respected going forward in our relationship. Before, I'd just been kind of begrudgingly accepting people calling me ""she/her"", etc. 

Well, it kinda turned into this whole thing, but the end result was that he said he would support me no matter what, respect my pronouns, my name change, and personally deal with anyone who has some shit to say.

1- How do you know you're non binary. For example I've always been a Tom boy, enjoyed doing ""boys"" things much more than my girl friends but I still know I'm a girl. Like what is different?

2- If you identified as non binary and wanted to enter say a sports competition, would you compete in the men's or the women's? Would it be what you are physically? As personally I don't see how it's fair if some men who identify as women enter women's competitions because they physically have an advantage in strength and stuff. 

3- How did you decide your name if you have a different one, did your parents have a say because they are technically the people who name you or was it all your choice?

4- Do you ever think you are at a disadvantage or treated differently at work or in a similar situation because you are non binary? 

5- Do you think there should be an age where you are able to decide if you want to legally change your name / gender having gone through it yourself.

2020-02-14 07:35:18,f3oumw,4,1,"Hi friends! So I've been taking T on and off since 2018, in total for about 1.5 years, maybe a little less. I've been mostly at pretty low doses. Being non-binary, I started it knowing that I may want or need to stop taking it one day. I've gotten to a point where I'm pretty comfortable with the changes I wanted to see happen, and I'm noticing some unwanted changes happen. I know I can't pick and choose what effects I get from testosterone, and I am wondering if the time has come for me to stop taking it. However, I also wonder how taking a very small dose weekly or biweekly would be a good option or if it wouldn't make much of a difference (I'm already on what's considered a very low dose, albeit I've only been on this dose for a month.)

I'd say one of my biggest concerns / areas of question in regards to stopping T is fat and muscle mass redistribution. I've found I miss having a more feminine figure than I do now, but I'm worried that if I stop T, my facial fat will go back to its pre-T state. My face was very feminine before and I really like the masculinization that has happened there.

Other reasons for me considering stopping T or lowering my dose even more include skin texture/acne on T, not wanting more facial hair, increased anxiety on T, and not wanting my hairline to change any more.

So those of you who have experience stopping testosterone, I have some questions:

‚Ä¢ how did fat redistribution affect you after stopping testosterone? Did it revert completely back to how it was before starting T? If you exercise, has that affected it at all?

‚Ä¢ is menstruation pretty much the same as pre-T?

‚Ä¢ any other changes or advice you'd like to add 

I've been pretty torn on this for a while now and I feel like it's time to make my decision, for the time being.

I'm from a writers‚Äô resources company called [Winning Writers](http://www.winningwriters.com/).    Part of our mission is to find and promote voices and themes    underrepresented in publishing,  including (but of course not limited   to) racial, cultural, national, religious, gender/sexual identity, body   positive, and \[dis\]abled. I‚Äôm  posting here specifically because our   long term goal is to change the  composition of our entry pool to   include more entries featuring diverse  characters and themes. These   voices need to be heard, and we are  actively reaching out to find them.

We are currently looking for new talent in humor poetry, short fiction and essay:

[The Wergle Flomp Humor Poetry Contest](https://winningwriters.com/our-contests/wergle-flomp-humor-poetry-contest-free)offers a first prize of $1000, a second prize of $250, and ten    honorable mentions of $100 each. Entrants are invited to submit humor    poetry on any theme. The top twelve entries will be published online.    The contest is international and the deadline is April 1. The contest is    free to enter.

[The Tom Howard/John H. Reid Fiction &amp; Essay Contest](https://winningwriters.com/our-contests/tom-howard-john-h-reid-fiction-essay-contest)offers a two first prizes of $3,000 each (up from $2,000 last year,)   as  well as ten honorable mentions of $200 each. Entrants are invited  to   submit short fiction and essays on any topic. The top twelve  entries   will be published online. The contest is international and the  deadline   is April 30th. The fee for the contest is $20.

I'm changing my name next month and wanna change my middle names too but I'm really indecisive.
Idk what to change or add - I'm considering two middle names bc some of my siblings have two. 
Also, I like having multiple names to choose from (I really don't like the idea of having one name my whole life and middle names are my solution, so as you can imagine they need a bit more weight than a standard middle name.)

My first name is Owen, and I like names that sound good together.
The names I have for middle names so far are Isaac, Louis, Everett, and Shane.

‚Ä¢ Isaac, because I went by it as a first name so it has sentimental value
‚Ä¢ Louis, from my original middle name Louise
‚Ä¢ Everett just bc I like it
‚Ä¢ Shane (or Shawn) because it's a name my parents would have given me if I was AMAB

I was originally going for Owen Louis, because it sounds really nice, and then Owen Isaac Louis... 
I got input from my friend who said Owen Louis is nice, but I'm super indecisive. 
But I also like Zach. And I'm not even sure if that, or Everett + Shane even suit me. So YEAH! A dilemma.

i am both looking for words for myself, but also for other nonbinary people. since the language is annoyingly binary - which words can nonbinary people use to describe their sexual orientation?

for myself i struggle to find words for liking only one gender, or for liking several but not all genders. bisexual/pansexual as far as i know are already inclusive, or are in the workings of becoming inclusive, but i struggle to find adequate word for a sexuality that does not include everyone. its a plus if its a common word, or a word that a lot of people use.

i also struggle to find words that can describe the special situation in regards to homophobia/sexual discrimination of any kind. (for example lesbian/gay makes it clear that youre part of a group that will experience homophobia)

also, a sidenote, can nonbinary people be straight? or are all nonbinary experiences gay? and if theres no straight, is the opposite then gay? or what? how can you describe a minority experience without words for said experience?

My feelings fluctuate, and some days I'm cool with femininity, some days I dig the more androgynous look. But some days, I really yearn for something I can't have just by dressing a certain way. 

I would like to try a more masculine look, but seeing myself with masculine clothes makes me feel uncomfortable. And I don't know if that's discomfort over the idea of me being masculine, or the other way around, and that I look too feminine to make it work. Because the feeling fluctuates, I'd take selfies where I was more androgynous/leaning masculine, then some days I'd look back and it'd be like 'Oh... This doesn't feel right.' 
Some days, it flatters me when for example a coworker told me I was addressed as bro by a customer and I didn't realise, some days it makes me¬†feel a bit weird when I remember what I look like and it doesn't fit. I don't mind female pronouns however. 

I'm stuck in this weird place and I don't know what to do. Settling for 'non-binary/genderqueer' would be an easy fit, but even now that I mentioned the idea of being 'male' not feeling right, I'm also feeling envy over extremely androgynous girls that can pass as men (eg. Cosplayers like kuryu, Hakken, Ryo), and just some Asian men in general. 
Eg. I had been watching a wuxia drama (where men all have long hair), and the realisation that even with my hair cut, I wouldn't look as good, and if I had my hair long, I could never look like that, gave me a deep sense of sadness. It's like, what's even the point of getting my haircut, y'know? As I type this, the feeling has been fading, but at that time I felt restless and miserable and decided to finally make a throwaway account and post this. 

Its like I WISH I had been born a guy, but I don't want to TURN into a guy, I don't want to transition, I'm not A guy. I've been dealt a female card and that's what I am.
I think about hormones, about top surgery. I don't feel attachment to my chest (fairly flat anyway). But then I think about being more hairy than I already am, having the ability to grow facial hair, it doesn't fit. I then wonder, if I had been born a guy, maybe this discomfort wouldn't have to exist. Or I wonder if I've just handpicked what I liked from the male gender, and not accepting everything that makes a male male sounds wrong. 

It's like I want to be something that I'm not, and I get jealous of something I can't have. And I know EVEN if I transition, even if my family somehow accepted me, even if I could erase people's memories of me from before, I know that I wouldn't become the ideal in my mind - tall, androgynously handsome, no facial hair etc. I'd probably still be jealous. It's almost like I just want to be a completely different person, and specifically people that I'm aesthetically attracted to. It's not just me wanting to generally be a different gender. 
I feel like it wouldn't fit if I were to transition because I've lived all my life as a female and that never really gave me much problem, and there's the issue with people's image of me. It would make me uncomfortable. And it's too late, I'm in my late 20s so the youth that I sort of want to experience as the other gender is gone now. Thinking about being a middle aged man, I guess I've never considered it.
But if I had been born the other gender without all those complications and with good genes, I would be happier? Am I just mistaking this for something else? 
It's draining feeling this way, I wish my mind would settle for something. There have been times I wanted to grow my hair out for femininity, it's easier for my appearance to fit. This time, I'm thrown on the other side of the spectrum and it sucks, because I really want something badly and I know it'll never happen. 

Anyway, this kinda dragged on. My mind would probably switch again later and I won't even feel this way anymore. I'd feel ridiculous for even making a fuss. I think thats the worst part. That it changes, so I can't make any solid solutions that would satisfy me completely and that I won't regret.

I've been wrestling with this problem since I was a youngster. By now I'm married, with no kids, seeing middle age on the horizon. I'm amab, but I've never really felt like a man. Not that I ever felt like a woman, either, mind you! I just haven't felt any connection with maleness. What even is it?

I don't have dysphoria. I think. ~~Sometimes~~ Often I'll look in the mirror and feel disappointed with how masculine I look. I don't want to have muscular shoulders. I don't want to have a beard shadow five minutes after shaving. But at the same time I don't exactly want much of a chest. And I am ok with my downstairs.

I went to a coffee shop in just my normal clothes and got misgendered (?) as ma'am, which made me a bit fluttery, but then again maybe it was just me being easily amused. I enjoyed it, but then I felt bad - like I'm having a laugh at other people's expense.

I've tried ~~some~~ ~~many~~ most of my wife's clothes (with her blessing), and feel like they work pretty well on me for the most part, but that may just be me being my strange self.

In theory I would like to try they/them pronouns, but I'm to much of a coward to talk about it. I'm older than most of you, for one, and people see me a certain way. Is it worth it to dismantle their mental image of me just because of my own feelings?

So for a bit of background, I'm AFAB, always wished I was a boy ever since I was a kid (I first said ""I'm not a girl!"" when I was 5 I think, major crisis claiming I was a boy not a girl when I was 12), but then I sort of pushed it in the background because I didn't realise I had the option to not be a girl. Two years ago I befriended an amazing trans girl and she made me realise that I'm probably nonbinary, I did research, cue a year of gender doubts and freaking out. I think I'm cracking now but I'm scared and also feel like I'm totally not valid.  

The thing is, I currently look femme, despite wearing mostly neutral clothes, having short hair, not using much makeup. I've been told I look kinda butch or like a tomboy so that's my starting point. But I still definitely look like a woman, and I hate being perceived as such. I'd definitely prefer to be perceived as male if I had to choose, but I don't really feel like I could be a super manly man either, more like a pretty boy (kind of the way I feel inside tbh) if that makes sense?  I'd definitely like to look more masculine than I look now and have a deeper voice, but I don't know if I'd want to go the full way? I'm also planning on getting top surgery because I have bad chest dysphoria.

2020-02-20 09:09:46,f6qgwe,0,1,"**Genderflow**

**Short version:** Genderflow is a flowing gender that changes slowly &amp; constantly. There is not a set amount of genders it switches between. Genderflow is infinite.

**Long version:** Genderflow is a gender that is perpetually changing. It is never to a specific gender identity, but sometimes there are existing labels that are close to what the gender feels like at the time. Sometimes it changes to a completely inexplicable feeling.

**Genderfae!**

**Explanation:** Genderfae is an experience of genderfluidity that never encompasses feeling masculine. 

(could be andro, femme or otherwise)

**Genderfaun!**

**Explanation:** Genderfaun is an experience of genderfluidity that never encompasses feeling feminine.

(could be andro, masculine or otherwise.)

**Fae Genderflow!**

**Explanation:** Fae Genderflow is a mix between Genderfae &amp; Genderflow. Fae Genderflow is a flowing gender that changes slowly &amp; constantly. There is not a set amount of genders it switches between. It is infinite. However it primarily on regular basis either does not, rarely, or barely encompasses a gender ever feeling masculine.

2020-02-20 10:38:09,f6r9rm,1,1,"This will probably be long as I tend to think about a lot of things. I know no one can actually tell me who I am or what I should identify as, but hoping for some feedback.

I've had trouble with gender since I was little. But looking back on it a lot of my problems seem stupid. Or at the very least like I wouldn't have considered them problems if I didn't have other people pointing them out to me. One of the first times I felt dysphoria was reading the Berenstain Bears (like I said, maybe dumb but I was probably 6). I can't remember exactly what it said, so it probably didn't straight out say ""blue and red is for boys"" and ""pink and white is for girls"" but that was the feeling I got from it. I felt bad. I liked blue and red, but those were the wrong colors.

And then it happened with a lot more things. I liked action figures. I thought bugs were neat. Creepy Crawlers Workshop was so much cooler than Easy Bake Oven. I wanted to be something cool or scary for halloween, not wear some sparkly dress. Disney princess movies were boring, they were about women who left all their friends for some random dude, how is that a good ending? I don't know if I really opened up about those thoughts so much, but if I even slightly did my mom would be mad. She hated that I had action figures. She bought me more barbies, she'd go through my room and get rid of things she didn't want me to have. Or put things in the garage, and if I asked for them back they were ""lost"" or ruined. She signed me up in a formal dance class where of course women have to wear dresses and men wear suits. I went to Catholic school with uniform up until fourth grade. (I also want to pause here, because I don't want to upset anyone. I know these were all just stereotypical gender things, and none of them can be used to determine what gender someone really is. But I grew up being TOLD they were gendered, and that I was wrong for what I liked.)

But that was just what I dealt with at home, and as a kid. As a teenager/adult then sexuality gets thrown in, and it's more confusing. I know now at least the most fitting label for me is demisexual. But it was a long time before I really met anyone I felt that kind of bond with. Which meant I thought I was asexual. And my mom thought I was a lesbian (at least to her credit, she approached me to tell me that was okay, but since I didn't feel like I was interested in girls I just felt like I was just... wrong in some way). And spending more time online, I started to realize generally men are considered the ""default"" gender, whereas women were ""other."" And that if I didn't clarify my gender online, I'd get treated more normally too. People were more responsive and cared about what I had to say, rather than being curious about where I lived, what I was wearing, if I was single etc. It felt good just being a person, judged off how I decide to portray myself vs being judged for things I was just born with and can't change. I didn't care about being seen as ""sexy"" or even want it at all. I just wanted people to think I was neat as a person.

Real life is actually way different than the anonymity the internet can provide. I can't act as confident, whatever I dress in I'm still a very small person. So when people think I'm a guy, they think I'm a teenager. I'm 29. It's my fault though with the baggy clothes and no makeup, so I don't snap at people for thinking I'm a guy. I don't even always correct them if it's just in passing (like someone I won't see again). Sometimes it even gives me a warm fuzzy feeling. Like the first time I wore a nice dress shirt and pants instead of a dress. Just picking those clothes out myself instead of being forced into a fancy dress I never liked the look of, helped me realize I CAN enjoy looking nice. Someone saying excuse me sir bumping into me was just the icing on the cake.

A friend recently came out to me as a trans (mtf). So I've been asking her some thoughts about gender. Did she feel naturally attracted to wearing dresses? Because I've just never felt it. I never saw nice pictures of women and felt that's what I want to be. Over the past week I've been reading posts here a bit, joined and unjoined the community 3 or 4 times, thought about posting. But the thing that really got to me were some of the pictures. The really androgynous ones, I get that feeling that I felt I was missing with most women's fashion. Of looking at someone's outfit and being like ""I like that, I want that, I would wear that."" The warm excitement people are supposed to feel about how they look in their clothes, when they're putting effort into how they look.

And I just... I don't know. Like I said, I realize a lot of my issues with gender are ones because other people put them on me. But I definitely resonate with a lot of things I see here. I didn't even get into how I considered being trans, threw that out. Realized even though I may have leaned towards more masculine things, I don't feel I'm a man either. Anyway I feel like this is already too long, but at least gets down some of my feelings. Funny that I'm pretty open on reddit posting about weird things (psychedelics/lucid dreaming &amp; dreaming in general/spirituality) but this is the one I feel the most anxiety about.

I was gonna flair this as a ask, but maybe support is what I need. I'd like to actually talk to people and get feedback. Maybe make more friends with people who don't find my other weird interests offputting. I don't know.

I had recently come out to her as a questioning enby and they told me that I couldn‚Äôt be valid or correct because they were on the enby scale. They said that I‚Äôm just copying them and I should move on.

However, even as I‚Äôm only just starting to really question whether or not I‚Äôm a cis girl, I‚Äôve found myself relating to almost every meme or post about being trans or enby. Also, I‚Äôve looked into gender euphoria and dysphoria and have related to both. I‚Äôve found myself wanting to bind and present as ambiguous.

Even though, their words have planted doubt into my mind. They were the ones who introduced me to nonbinary and made me aware that this was a choice. Am I just copying them? Am I valid in coming out to my friends and asking them to use they/them? 

Any advice would be appreciated. I‚Äôm really new to this whole thing, and even though this argument happened a while ago, they haven‚Äôt brought it up since, and everything they said might be true, I‚Äôd still like your thoughts.

2020-02-21 15:52:25,f7d0j8,18,1,"Hi everyone!

25 M here. I recently started dating someone who is nonbinary and coincidentally, my brother has also recently come out as nonbinary as well. I am half-normie/half-not normie, so this isn't quite brand new to me or anything and I've been friends with many queer people and in alternative social spaces. 

But I'm cisgender and have never had these thoughts. I can of course put myself in the shoes of gay friends or family because I know what love is like, I know what it's like to find people attractive, etc. But nonbinary is still a new concept for me because I only have ever seen gender in binary terms and I still mostly do. My brain's innate reaction is to say, ""You're a man"" and ""You're a woman."" And so it's very hard for me to get to the \*feelings\* and thought processes that lead people to feel nonbinary -- and understanding that is essential for me! I do find myself sometimes having what might be considered problematic views on this as an innate reaction. I quickly overcome it by recognizing it's absurdity, but here are some of the thoughts I've found myself having when nonbinary people and situations are brought up:

*-There's an unexplainable sense of being uncomfortable and/or confused because my brain tells me things like ""is this just a phase?"" or ""are they forcing themselves to be this way from seeing things or talking with people suggesting they could be nonbinary/is it truly innate or just a temporary identity""? To even worse and more horrendous thoughts like ""is this a condition like anxiety or depression that can be changed?""*

*-Is it bad that I innately see nonbinary people as either a man or a woman? I feel like I'm putting on an act calling someone ""they"" because it doesn't feel honest, as I don't \*truly\* see them as nonbinary? Is this how everyone is? Does your mind still view nonbinary individuals as their birth and assigned gender?*

I sincerely apologize if any of this is upsetting or triggering, particularly the part above. I'm trying to give my unfiltered thoughts here in the hopes that my unfiltered thoughts can be changed. I'm very, very interested in hearing all of your thoughts. **What does it feel like to be nonbinary? Does it feel like something is different with you than people like me?

I am working on putting together a wedding wear line for my local fashion week show. I really want to do something that is less focused on femme bridal super traditional type wedding and more on things for my non-binary friends. (I'm cis female)
My biggest questions are 1) What would you want to wear to your wedding? 2) What are things that a nb person might have when wedding wear shopping? 3) Do I need to consider birth assignment when cutting garments? (I'm not sure how to word this one lol sorry if it comes off rude?) Like, tradionally, male pants are cut with more room in the crotch. Is that important for those of you amab? or can you comfortably go either way? 

I ask #3 just for sample garment purposes, I dont want to cut  things one way or the other and not be able to fit someone. 
I know a lot of fashion is all personal tastes and such, which is why I ask all of you!

(also, if anyone could help me out with some un-gendered wedding terminology I'd be grateful! Like the traditional word for all this jazz is Bridal but that's v fem. and my goal is to be v inclusive?)

And literally any thoughts yall have that I should consider in either designing, making, and even fitting and such that would help me make anyone feel comfortable and confident would be so amazing and appreciated!

2020-02-22 02:09:19,f7lw0u,22,1,"Hi, all.  I'm wanting to write something akin to a spy novel, where the protagonist is revealed at the climax to have been a near urban legend-status figure in intelligence circles.  The true identity, known only as Fog, is nonbinary and AFAB.  However, throughout the story, they are playing the part of a cis woman, Maria Covine, going by she/her as a cover identity.  As the beginning of the climax, ""Maria"" is captured (intentionally as part of Fog's plan) by the primary antagonists and found seemingly dead when said antagonists' hideout is stormed.  At a certain point of that assault, they get back up with the line ""Maria Covine had indeed died that night, a false identity that had served her purpose, but Fog was still very much alive.""

From there on out, they're referred to as Fog and explicitly as ""they"", but barring a few clues of ""Maria"" acting a little strangely at certain points throughout the story, this is the first time the reader is let in on that secret.

Fog is referred to as ""they"" when discussed by other characters earlier in the story, but more in a ""We don't know anything about them"" way rather than the secondary antagonists respecting their identity.

My question is bluntly, is this raising any red flags?  I like the idea, personally, and a friend who is far, far better-versed in LGBTQ issues and representation than I am said she didn't see anything obviously wrong with it, but she also said I should get feedback from people who have actually lived the nonbinary experience for if there were more subtle issues.

I'm on Cyproteron (Androcour)~12,5mg/d (¬ºx50mg pill) and 
1x Capsule Pueraria Mirifica (P.M.) every second day

Before that I only did the P.M. every day. I got effects but also sides of it, after a while.

I am happy now with the appearance it gives me but I want to look a bit more fem

As the title says I wanna try oestraclin gel because it reduces the effects on the kidney. It hurts sometimes and I want to minimize the risks.

The dose for ordinary mtf HRT is I think at 3g/2x daily. I'm a big fan of microdosing but I'm not quite sure how to actually change the medication.

I could reduce Cyproteron to ¬ºpill/every second day and do microdosing oestraclin in that day I don't take cypro.
or
just do microdosing oestra.

And there is still the question what dosage is right.

When I came out, they weren‚Äôt supportive at all.

First off, I was AMAB and I'm old compared to a lot of the people posting here. I'm 35 and, while that feels like a lifetime apart, it's amazing to see people in their teens thinking about these things. I only learnt what nonbinary was in my early 30s, only came out to myself at 32 and to my parents a few weeks ago. It was hugely damaging to me not knowing why I felt the way I did and it's wonderful to know that other people won't have to grow up in that same world.   


I recently changed my name - I now go by Dorian Crane after years of \*hating\* my previous name. It's taking a while for people to get used to it (but that's fine, they are trying and that's all that matters). I'm lucky to live in a liberal enclave and have lots of trans friends, so I'm not doing anything unusual in my circle - we are aggressively queer and it's wonderful. Again, I didn't have that growing up and until I found it I didn't know how much I needed it.  


My parents have been.... mixed. My dad was amazing, when I emailed him his reply was perfect and made me cry a lot. My mum less so. She objects to singular they, she doesn't understand why I'd want to make a fuss about it and I think she's taken my name change pretty badly. Luckily they live several hours away and I don't really see them very often. And my sisters, who are the best, have adopted the cause of winning her round. She I guess I'm pretty lucky as far as it goes - while my mum hasn't been the best, she's trying and isn't a huge factor in my life (I've never been close to my parents).  


Another thing that it took me a long time to come to terms with is  that I started losing my hair in my late twenties. It used to be shoulder length, then I cut it short to avoid looking like Bill Bailey, then over the summer started shaving it off entirely. It's hard to explain why it bothered me so much - it gave me massive dysmorphia because balding is such a male coded experience and I hated that I couldn't go anything about it. Luckily bald heads can be really queer coded and I have a head shape that suits it. I'm going to try and attach a photo to this - probably as a comment? I'm new to Reddit and still figuring it out.  


I'm not sure where I'm going with a lot of this. Mostly that I'm old and I'm still very confused by all of this but I'm brute forcing my way through it. I wouldn't have had the confidence to do this a few years ago but getting out of a horribly toxic relationship and into a new friendship circle of hella queer folks helped massively. I'd like to be able to help other people with this journey but don't really know how - any suggestions on how to get into activism online would be much appreciated.

It's hard to explain why it bothered me so much - it gave me massive dysmorphia because balding is such a male coded experience and I hated that I couldn't go anything about it. Luckily bald heads can be really queer coded and I have a head shape that suits it. I'm going to try and attach a photo to this - probably as a comment? I'm new to Reddit and still figuring it out.  \n\n\nI'm not sure where I'm going with a lot of this. Mostly that I'm old and I'm still very confused by all of this but I'm brute forcing my way through it. I wouldn't have had the confidence to do this a few years ago but getting out of a horribly toxic relationship and into a new friendship circle of hella queer folks helped massively. I'd like to be able to help other people with this journey but don't really know how - any suggestions on how to get into activism online would be much appreciated.  \n\n\nJust... look after each other and try not to spend decades not being yourselves I guess.

So I‚Äôm 17. I‚Äôve been questioning my gender since I was 9. I know I‚Äôm not female, and I am comfortable saying I was a guy, but over the past couple of years I feel like somethings still missing. I think don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm a guy or if I‚Äôm non-binary. I have dysphoria with my chest bad and I‚Äôve been binding for a year now, but I don‚Äôt have that much bottom dysphoria (though it‚Äôs still there sometimes if I think too much). I‚Äôm just stuck. My mom is completely supportive and she‚Äôs help so much since I came out to her 4 years ago, but my dad is still kind of rocky. I had a hard enough time getting him to believe me when I said I wasn‚Äôt a girl, but if I even mention non-binary he‚Äôd definitely think I was going crazy.

I don't feel really disgusted by my body, but i'm not sure if it feels right either. What I feel is not necessarily a hatred for my body, it's more kind of a disconnection.

 It doesn't bother me that much in daily life, but that could also just be because I wear more masculine clothes and my curves/chest aren't that visible. 

However, if I think about the future and remember the fact that I will still have this body, I feel a little disappointed.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I've only been out to myself as Nonbinary (Demigirl, Bi-Gender, or Just NB) and Bi for a few months. I've come out to my husband, but aside from this I'm completely closeted. Ofcourse, he doesn't fully accept that I'm trans (He's a bit behind the times, if you get what I mean). But he's cool with my bisexuality. 

I've done a few subtle things to help me take pride in my identity, like buying pride pins and removing all mention of my AGAB from my online bios. 

But I can't help but want to take the next step. I want to meet someone like me. I want to feel safe and valid next to people who understand what I'm going through. There's this loneliness welling up inside of me that I wish I could help. My self-doubt and shyness doesn't help one bit XD. The only interactions I've had with anyone who was LGBTQ+ has been over a gaming headset a few years ago. Or reading forum posts. But I didn't know who I was then, figures. It's so . . . isolating.

 It's just really lonely here. I don't feel welcome in my house or my family or even wider society as a Bi and NB (mostly NB) person. Much less Demigirl/Bi-gender. And the one person I do kinda know from gaming (they are Genderfluid) I'm not willing to come out to yet -I'm not willing to come out to anyone yet.

Since I don't have any LGBTQ+ groups near me, I feel like the only chance I have to even SEE another NB or Bi person is to try to get to a Pride Parade an hour away from me. It's in a city I'm unfamiliar with, and it's coming up this March. I don't know if I can make it there, much less if my husband would be willing to come or support the idea. He's one of those people that thinks Pride Month shouldn't exist, you know.

I‚Äôve done therapy my whole life because I have some mental health issues, but I‚Äôve never ever talked about my sexuality or gender, and I feel like it‚Äôs time. 

I‚Äôm AFAB. From age 3-7 I insisted I was a boy. My parents never talked me out of it, they just had a sort of ‚Äúit‚Äôs probably a phase‚Äù attitude about it. I mean if they did have any problems with it, I‚Äôve completely repressed it because I don‚Äôt remember them ever being mean about it in any way. I remember a convo with my dad where he said I didn‚Äôt have to stop thinking of myself as a boy if I didn‚Äôt want to. I did get bullied in school by some girls, but I didn‚Äôt care too much about that because I wasn‚Äôt friends with them anyway. Everyone my age in my neighbor were boys, so all of my good friends were boys and they all thought of me as a boy. The only negative thing I remember regarding my friends was that my best friend really thought I was a boy, so him and me and both our parents and our teacher had to have a talk at one point about how I was a girl. He got really mad and didn‚Äôt accept it at first, but once he did he refused to be friends with me. It hurt my feelings and our parents tried to force us to still hang out, but I just kinda got over it at some point and made a new best friend.

Around age 7/8 it just stopped. I felt perfectly comfortable being female from then on.

Then at some point in high school I did a ‚Äúbreaking social norms‚Äù project for AP Psych where I just randomly showed up presenting as a guy. I didn‚Äôt tel anyone about it before hand. And despite being a conservative and a Catholic (with conservative and Catholic friends), everyone was like ‚Äúyeah we‚Äôre not surprised, it‚Äôs cool‚Äù. Which was, frankly, shocking. And made me rethink everything I knew about gender. I was expecting to have to argue with people but everyone was like ‚Äúyeah this makes sense‚Äù and the best answer I got from anyone basically was because I‚Äôve always been a tomboy.

Anyway life went on and I was happy as a gymnast/cheerleader/sorority girl for the rest of high school and college, never really questioning my gender again. 

Except whenever the topic of me ‚Äúwanting to be a boy‚Äù when I was little came up, it would bother me for a couple days. I grew up in the 90s, so basically every girl my age had a short bob or pixie cut at some point. So whenever I‚Äôd say that I thought I was a boy, basically any girl would be like OMG ME TOO. But every time this happened, we‚Äôd realize that they just meant they liked Sporty Spice and had a bob. For me.. I mean I tried to pee on the side of building with my (boy) friends and told all my teachers and doctors and everyone that I WAS a boy. It just seemed very different than what anyone else experienced. And I was in high school / college from 2005-201so things were not nearly as accepting at this point that they are now. I know that doesn‚Äôt seem like it was that long ago but it really was a lot different then, than it is now.

Anyway. After I got married in 2016 to a very open-minded man, and learned a lot about the world, I totally changed. We moved a few states away from my family and old friends and met some great open-minded people. Since that time I‚Äôve come out as pan and possibly poly. And I‚Äôve also accepted myself for the ‚Äúbutch‚Äù woman I really am. I shave my head and don‚Äôt wear makeup and present very androgynously.

And for whatever reason, it really bugs me. Like I don‚Äôt really feel like I wish they‚Äôd have assumed I was male. But I also don‚Äôt feel good about people assuming I‚Äôm female.

I totally accept that gender is not a binary (like I thought it was growing up).

I used these products    
    
Manic Panic Bleach (vol 30)    
Wella Color Charm Pale Ash Blonde Toner    
Wella #T18 Lightest Ash Blonde    
Salon Care Volume 20 Developer    
REDKEN Purple Shampoo    
    
1.) I bleached my hair - *my hair is already bleach blonde but I lightened it anyway so the color would stick*    
2.) Dyed my hair with the Wella toners mixed with developer, I did each color separately - *I left them in for about an hour each*    
3.) Wet hair and lather A LOT of purple shampoo in - *leave in for 30-60 minutes*    
    
Now, the purple shampoo is the most CRITICAL step. It‚Äôs not hard but without it your hair won‚Äôt be silver at all.    
Just lather a TON throughout your semi-wet hair and leave it in for 30 minutes to an hour, that‚Äôs stuff is MAGIC.    
To maintain the color I redo the purple shampoo every two weeks, every week would keep it from fading better but it‚Äôs not necessary. It‚Äôs super easy and I love it!    
Personally I would recommend using a hair mask once a week to keep your hair soft be bleach kinda fucks it. The Pantene hair mask works wonders.

I am a fourth year Geography Honours student studying at the University of St Andrews. I am writing my dissertation on the ways in which people communicate in online spaces and how online community spaces help to empower and support non-binary individuals. I will also be looking at how gender is expressed and constructed in these spaces and how experiences within these groups influences the ways in which people express themselves and feel in the offline world. To do this I am conducting a series of online interviews over messenger services.

I am on sub-cu injectable T- .26 mL weekly (200mg per ML) and have just started using topical estrogen (from a compounding pharmacy) to feel more of a balance around dysphoria. Even on a low dose of T I have a lot of muscles which I don't love. I've been on estrogen for about two weeks- at a very low dose. It does seem to already be changing things.

2020-02-26 23:24:22,fa2g9i,4,1,"Hi, this is going to be long and probably jumbled because I am literally at my wit's end. I don't have many trans people in my social circle, so figure y'all could maybe relate to me and/or offer me some guidance. 

I found out a couple years ago that Starbucks will pay for employees' trans surgeries through their insurance plans. Having wanted top surgery for a while, I made a plan to get a job there to pay for it. Against my parents' wishes, I stayed in the city I live in (Boston) last summer to work and ramp up hours so I could be insured. I got a sublet and worked fulltime all summer, and lived 100% independently for the first time in my life. When classes started, I kept working 20 hours a week on top of earning a bachelor's degree full time. I cannot work less than that, because that is the hourly requirement for the insurance benefits. Last semester I nearly died, but I managed to make it through. At the end of the semester, I went to my school's medical center to see about acquiring my surgery letters.

I am going with Dr Adam Tobias at Beth Israel, and he requires a letter from my physician which basically says my body is healthy for surgery, and a letter from a therapist saying that I am trans and would benefit from this surgery. I think the requirement of these types of letters takes bodily autonomy away from trans people on the basis that transness is a mental disorder; it assumes that trans people are not in a position to make decisions about their own bodies. As far as I'd heard, though, it didn't seem like people had too difficult of a time getting them, so I wasn't expecting the amount of difficulty that I am experiencing right now.

The people in the health center, both the therapist and the physician, claimed they could not, in good conscience, write me either of these letters as they were not ""trans experts"". I thought, okay, fine. They referred me to Fenway Health, and organization  that is known for its treatment of the LGBTQ community. So I went to a physician there as a new patient, and asked for the surgery letter. I was then referred to a woman who is in charge of the whole ""letter thing"" and she spoke to me for a minute in the appointment. I felt a little patronized during the conversation ngl, but she said at the follow-up I schedule for an unrelated vaccine I had gotten at that appointment in six weeks and we'd ""see about getting [my] letter"" then, but nothing was super clear to me. The follow-up I scheduled was with a nurse for a vaccine administration, so I'm not sure how that's all gonna work with this person. I just feel super unsure about it. I then asked the doctor how I would get my therapist letter, and she said to contact  Behavioral Health at Fenway. 

Fenway BH has a waiting list because of the amount of patients they have so I would likely have to get on it and wait for an indefinite amount of time, which felt impractical; I should have mentioned that I am really trying to have this surgery THIS summer for many reasons, the biggest one being that I am earning a degree right now. I don't know if I'd be able to miss as much school as I would after a surgery like that, especially since I'm a music student. I study classical voice, so I my body is my instrument. I have no idea if I will be able to sing in the immediate weeks after surgery or how it is going to affect the instrument in general. So anyways, I've got a time restraint. And if I have to keep working 20 hours during my senior year of college then I'm really gonna die. 

I called BH and stated my business. I had to leave a message. I got a message back same day, referring me to who I am 98% sure is the same person I spoke with at my doctor's appointment. This frustrated me, as I was told to contact BH and now was back at square one. So I called her, left a message stating my confusion and that I was pretty sure we had spoken before, and please call me back. I got no calls for over two weeks. I called again, leaving a follow-up message and asking her to give me a call. She actually did call once, over a week later, didn't leave a message, and hasn't called back since. I have been seeing the therapist that I initally went to in school and have told him all of this. I expressed my frustration with even needing the letters in the first place, and he agrees that the system sucks. He still refuses to help me. He says he will if it gets to a certain point, but apparently we haven't reached that yet. 

I am at my wits end. I feel like nobody's listening to me. The therapist wants me to call AGAIN, but like, does it really look like she wants to answer my call? The one call she made was at 5PM on a Friday. Obviously I am not a priority. And all she has to do is answer my question and tell me what steps I have to take. I almost feel like she doesn't want to give me a letter. 

I am having a really hard time dealing with all the stress of working 20 hours at Starbucks and attending conservatory full time while having to also deal with all this letter bullshit. I have a life-long history of depression and anxiety, and I feel like I am barely keeping my head above water. I literally can't even schedule a consultation with this surgeon until I have both of these letters. I feel like nobody is listening to me or giving me a straight answer. I'm required to have outside approval for this surgery and the people who can do that for me are refusing to and leaving me on read. I am losing my mind. My parents don't even know about this surgery or know that I'm queer at all and wouldn't be receptive to it, so I'm navigating all of this on my own. I feel like my surgery isn't going to happen for a long time, and I can't take this job and this binder anymore (I've been binding for three years now and I've had enough).

I don't feel any physical body dysphoria, I just really feel uncomfortable when other people assume that since I'm a woman, I must relate to XYZ experiences. Especially when it's full-on cis women who do this.

I'm in a small town so I'm wondering if he's frantically googling how to treat trans people... I hope not. 

I could totally see that I might be the first trans person here, but based on the fact everyone has used my correct name so far, I actually have hope that I'm not the first. I'm probably gonna be the first non-binary person. 

I fully expect surprise when I say ""actually I'm mostly here for a surgery referral cause I only kinda want HRT."" 

I also have no idea what my affirmation letter says. I sent a draft to my therapist to give to my psychiatrist who wrote it all out and faxed it here. He did call to tell me that ""gender dysphoria"" isn't technically in my chart (they're supportive, just clueless.) 

I don't know what is going to happen an hour from now. Maybe I'll walk out with a prescription for a low dose T, maybe not. Hopefully I'll get a referral to a surgeon. 

Update, cause my doctor walked in before I was done.

I am *not* the first. Did you know there are different tests for hormones based on the binary? I didnt. Like, they'll test for T and E for everyone, but the scale is different. Guess I'm getting lumped in with the boys.

2020-02-28 01:57:21,fan54k,1,1,"Have been going through this sub and some other trans subs and getting those good and bad feelings in my chest. This is going to get really long, but I haven't talked to anybody about this in years and have to write it out

A little bit of my story:

I realized I wasn't cis when I was maybe 15 (I'm 22 now). A lot of this happened on/due to tumblr, and I spent a lot of time on there trying out different pronouns, names, labels, and it was fun and really helped me a lot. I had a lot of supportive online friends and a lot of people who were exploring gender identity in my corner.

In real life, I cut all my hair off and bought a binder. I never really used it outside of my room but it was nice to have. I think I came out to one or two irl friends as nonbinary, and they didn't really understand but were cool about it. I came out to my mom and it was a total nightmare and really broke my heart, but I still felt strong in my transness and proud of it. 

When I went to college, I moved a couple states away and was living on an LGBT floor of a dorm. Being in that environment was really really incredible for me. I'm from (and still living in) Wyoming (lol, you can imagine), so I had never really been around other out and proud and supportive queer people. I read about gender euphoria on these subs and I know exactly how that feels. Like I had that. Being around a group of amazingly supportive people who used they/them, called me by my chosen name. It was really something else. 

Unfortunately I had a really terrifying episode of psychotic depression with addiction mixed in while I was there, and dropped out after one semester. I moved back to my mom's house. It was the craziest thing and hardest thing and it makes me really sad to think about: I was out and making so much progress and feeling loved and then suddenly I was back in a place where I was closeted, not supported, and didn't feel like I could ever come out.

I kind of just retreated and built a little nest in the closet after that. Like shoved alllll those feelings down and made myself forget about all of it, not even think about being cis or trans, just not thinking about it at all.

After that trauma there was a lot of other trauma. That summer I moved to a nearby small college town with some friends. I got into an abusive relationship with one of them and just totally suppressed any queer feelings because I could not deal with it. Now I've been away from him for a year, and I think all of it is bubbling back up again

It's so weird because when I came out as bisexual at 14 I was so confident in that identity, and that confidence and love for my queerness carried through until I moved back after dropping out. Now I cry if I think about having sex with a girl, feel a lot of guilt and shame, would definitely break down if I went to my college's LGBT group. I'm not closeted about my sexuality but I'm not feeling good about it. And now all this gender stuff is getting thrown back in.

For the past few weeks it's just been ""maybe I'm still nonbinary but there's no way I can ever come back out. Ever."" I think I am nonbinary. She/her and ""girl"" feel so so empty to me, like I have no connection to that. I don't know her. I think about people calling me they/them and thinking of me as a not a girl and I'm filled with so much warmth and care and excitement. I think about fucking around with my gender presentation again and that makes me feel excited.

So I guess over the past few hours I've started to think well what if I come out. What if I just do it. I took a depression nap about it and that thought has intensified. What if I just did it. I think I would be happy.

But the idea of being rejected by my friends who I love so much (98% cis guys) fucks me up. That would break me just like it did with my mom. I also worry that no one is going to believe me or take me seriously because I don't hit enough of the markers for people to consider me ""actually trans."" I'm AFAB and over the past year I've fallen into a style that I feel really cute and comfortable in, which is a lot of dresses. I don't really want to give that up (since high school I've had this goal in my head of ""binder with a dress"" but I don't know how weird that would be). I like having longer hair. I'm not interested in binding every day or going on HRT anytime soon. Etc.

I don't know. I'm starting to think that I really want to come out, at least to my friends. I'm just so scared. I'm so tempted to rip the band aid off right now lolll but I know I should probably think on it for awhile. I also don't think I'll be ready to dive headfirst into gender after I do come out, I've got so much going on right now. But at least they/them. That kind of feels like exactly what I need.

If you read all of this thanks so much. I've made myself shut up about it and ignore it for so long.
