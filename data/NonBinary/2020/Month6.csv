Even without my breasts, which are the main source of my dysphoria and dysmorphia, I could still be read as a teen girl because a girl without breasts is still a girl. I like being read as a boy better at some times, but not others.

I already give people gender confusion based on my natural appearance, as I‚Äôve been told that I have a neutral face and voice. Yet, when I weighed my opinions on hypothetical HRT, I was only 50/50. It wasn‚Äôt a resounding yes or no.

Yet, I feel like there‚Äôs no place for me because of the binary. Sometimes I feel neither, sometimes both, and because I don‚Äôt have a fixed concept of what I want, I don‚Äôt know what to do.

In a perfect world, I lean more towards an androgynous appearance with no secondary sex characteristics. But that‚Äôs physically unattainable.

It's a neural pathway that needs to be formed, I've heard various estimates on how long this takes (66 days, 492 times, etc.), so let's start greasing that groove together!  


I'm hosting a few Zoom groups meant for social connection of non-binary/GNC/trans folks, with the primary goal of allowing participants to try out or get more accustomed to a new name and/or pronouns.   


About the meetings:  
\- Times/dates vary. My time zone is the Western US, but I'll try to find times that work for everyone interested, if they vary widely. I'm limiting these to 6 people per group due to the dynamics of group conversation. If there is wider interest, I'll make them ongoing.   
\- I'm doing this for free, so I'm using free Zoom which is limited to 40min per session. I will open a new room at the 40 min mark and we will all switchover. In total each meeting will be 80 min (1 hour 20 min).  
\- You will need to have access to Zoom.   
\- I prefer that everyone be on camera, but it's not required, as long as your audio is working.   
\- I know that some of us may have a few different name options we are deciding between. You can discuss this or your options in the group, but I ask that you please choose only 1 to be identified by for the duration of the meeting. Put it in your Zoom ID name along with your pronouns (I can guide on how to do this if you do not know).  
\- We will do a round of introductions with name and pronouns.   
\- I don't want this to be extremely structured or artificial, but in order to avoid Zoom Silence... I'll have a few prepared questions &amp; conversation topics. Some serious, some fun, some random. I'll post them on screen share. We will go around &amp; each person will choose a question, or create one of their own, &amp; ask it to another person, using their name. Then anyone can comment on their answer, or contribute, being sure to use names and pronouns as much as possible. (E.g. ""Ash, what's your favorite food?"", ""oh my gosh, Riley, I'm having a similar experience."", ""I really resonate with what they were saying about representation &amp; how meaningful that is."")  
\- Please come to the group with an intention to be mindful and supportive of everyone. Use their correct name and pronouns, they will be displayed on screen. Sometimes, even trans and non-binary people can misgender others, so if this happens, catch yourself, apologize, correct yourself, and move on.   


Meeting with internet people will always carry some amount of risk. But some steps I'm taking to help with security:  
\- I am not posting this link publicly. I will only communicate date, time, zoom link, and room password in private messages.  
\- After someone messages me expressing interest, I'll vet by reviewing your Reddit history &amp; ask you a few personal questions.  
\- Please be mindful of your personal safety. I know that so many of us are not in living situations that are supportive of this process. You can go do this on your phone in your car, outside, or while on a walk. You can use headphones on your computer inside &amp; no one will hear people referring to you. If you need to duck out unexpectedly or turn off your video, that is ok.

2020-06-01 20:24:20,gus8a9,2,3,"So today is June 1st, happy Pride everyone! This day in particular is super important to me, because it was June 1st last year when I came to the realization I was non-binary. For the previous year before that point I had started to question my gender, but it was only on the basis of possibly wanting to be more feminine. But I'm not a woman (I'm AMAB btw), so that wasn't quite right. But Pride Month happening did make me think of non-binary, and when I did, everything started to click. And looking more into non-binary identities, I realized demiguy was what I was looking for like a couple of weeks later. Partially male, partially agender, that fits.

One thing that has come from this is a lot of doubts. I've had some doubt over my own identity, as much as I try to avoid it. Or to be more exact, trying to rationalize my own gender to myself has not been the best idea. It makes me feel fake sometimes. Right now, and maybe just in general, I am non-binary, demiguy because that's my gender identity. I partially don't want to even think about it beyond that. Granted, I've also been a bit slow at this. Like 7 months after, I realized ""oh, this means I'm queer, right?"" I'd never even considered that that word applied to me, somehow. I'm still in the closet IRL, so I don't know how my family would feel. I'd like to believe they'd be supportive, but I just don't know.

That's not even all my doubts and concerns, but none of that takes away how much better I feel just knowing my own gender like this. Just reminding myself I'm non-binary is a good way to improve my mood. Even closeted, I feel free compared to how I was. Like I never knew things weren't right until they were, I guess. I'm not even sure this describes how I feel vs how I used to before I knew, but its the closest things that come to mind that I can describe it as. Now knowing I'm non-binary, is the one upside of the otherwise meaningless, miserable, disappointing past 365 days of my life.

I'm really glad I made this post, I needed to talk about this today. And this was the most obvious place to say it so um...yeah. Was undecided between Yay and Rant tag btw.

I thought it'd be a good idea to have a singular pronoun added to English (just added, not changing any current pronouns), because then it could be adopted by the wider population.

I'm not nonbinary though, so I thought it'd be best to go to the people who'd mainly use this pronoun and see your thoughts.

2020-06-03 11:45:37,gvsgmy,1,1,"Living as a teen is difficult enough, so I'm gonna make it clear that when I say I really earned my confidence, I mean I spent countless nights figuring out who I am as a person just to make it to this point, with very little support.

These days my best friend, my rock, gets me through everything. I never trusted my parents enough to learn on them.

‚òÜ

The idea I am making this post off of is based on a  conversation that changed my entire life. 

While my parents didn't start off good when becoming parents, they picked their shit up and raised us. Maybe to the best of their abilities, maybe not. I may never be sure. But I am certain that every person has their breaking point, and I have hit mine. Although, very quietly. I am not certain if, when I'm of age and move out (which will hopefully be asap) and can live on my own, weather or not I should keep talking to my parents. And, at that, most of my family. Don't get me wrong, there are diamonds in the rough, such as my youngest sister, two cousins my older brother, but I dont know if this will ruin things with them.

I love my mom, but I cant with my dad. I came out to my parents first when i was in 7th grade, and i told them i was somewhere in between bi and pan. Things are a bit different now (and I usually only call myself queer now since labels suck in my opinion) and I thought I might as well update them, though it did not go as planned.

I used the classic ""A name is a gift, and I've out grown it like I would old baby clothes"" explaining method with my mom, and it didnt blow over well, to my surprise. The whole not wanting a gender thing and wanting to change my birth name and wanting to be called ""they"" really pushed her, though I layed it down as gently as I could, to tell my FATHER.

Now, time for an important fact...my father is the bane of my existence. He does everything from gaslight me to call me the disappointment of the family. He has called me many things, from mental to a mistake only, after all of it, he always blamed it on his rage problems and the way he was raised.

I never trusted my parents enough to learn on them.\n\n‚òÜ\n\nThe idea I am making this post off of is based on a  conversation that changed my entire life. \n\nWhile my parents didn\'t start off good when becoming parents, they picked their shit up and raised us. Maybe to the best of their abilities, maybe not. I may never be sure. But I am certain that every person has their breaking point, and I have hit mine. Although, very quietly. I am not certain if, when I\'m of age and move out (which will hopefully be asap) and can live on my own, weather or not I should keep talking to my parents. And, at that, most of my family. Don\'t get me wrong, there are diamonds in the rough, such as my youngest sister, two cousins my older brother, but I dont know if this will ruin things with them.\n\nI love my mom, but I cant with my dad. I came out to my parents first when i was in 7th grade, and i told them i was somewhere in between bi and pan. Things are a bit different now (and I usually only call myself queer now since labels suck in my opinion) and I thought I might as well update them, though it did not go as planned.\n\nI used the classic ""A name is a gift, and I\'ve out grown it like I would old baby clothes"" explaining method with my mom, and it didnt blow over well, to my surprise. The whole not wanting a gender thing and wanting to change my birth name and wanting to be called ""they"" really pushed her, though I layed it down as gently as I could, to tell my FATHER.\n\nNow, time for an important fact...my father is the bane of my existence. He does everything from gaslight me to call me the disappointment of the family. He has called me many things, from mental to a mistake only, after all of it, he always blamed it on his rage problems and the way he was raised.

This fold makes it easier to put the binder on without it bunching up or twisting as much.

Here‚Äôs how I put my binder on:

- Fold binder
- Put arms and head through
- Bend over like you‚Äôre bowing
- Pull the binder as far down as possible while it‚Äôs still folded
- Unbunch or untwist if needed

- Bend over

2020-06-03 20:23:27,gw1tvr,2,1,"Hi all. I apologize in advance if this explanation doesn‚Äôt make sense, but it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been rolling around in my head for a few years now and only recently realized I could probably just ask. I also may possibly be using certain terms incorrectly, but I‚Äôll do my best.

I was AMAB, and have always presented myself in a way such that people identify me as a man. However, I‚Äôve never particularly been comfortable with that label, but it‚Äôs unclear to me whether that‚Äôs because of a central identity issue or whether it‚Äôs because I generally reject the idea of gender. As context, I am (now) a social scientist and I focus a lot on social construction, and generally speaking, identifying as a man is never something I have done by choice. I have no problem with doing things traditionally considered feminine - I know that for me, the major reason I don‚Äôt more often is because of social fear. That said, I don‚Äôt feel particularly uncomfortable being traditionally masculine either. I have felt this way for as long as I can remember. 

That all said, I also am concerned that choosing to identify as non-binary as described in my feelings above is something I am more easily able to do because I was AMAB. As an example always in my head whenever I try to think about this, I work in and study racism-related things too, and one thing that those of us in the field are always concerned about is white people who reject the idea of race and don‚Äôt identify as white as a way to avoid confronting racism. Colorblindness as a psychological construct is something we actively study, and white people choosing not to see themselves as white is a big part of that. And so for gender, I am fully aware that by virtue of being identified as a man for most intents and purposes, I have benefited from sexism as a system and thus don‚Äôt have to think about gender as much as someone identifying as a woman. As such, it‚Äôs easier for me than it is others to be focused on my rejection of gender as important.

(I am not looking to argue with anyone about whether racism or sexism exist. If that‚Äôs your qualm with my post, you‚Äôre not going to find a willing debate partner in me.)

So what I am struggling with is what to do, if anything, about not really being comfortable with saying that I am a man. Is it even important to do so? I allow my students to share their pronouns with me, but I (perhaps unfairly) seldom share my own. He/him doesn‚Äôt feel right. However, while I like they/them, it hits a logical problem in my head when I also consider that (1) I kind of generally think that gendered pronouns (he, she) are linguistically unnecessary and (2) I don‚Äôt know if me identifying as non-binary is a reflection of a worldview I am more easily able to have because of being AMAB, or of a personal identity that is important for me to embrace. Frankly, at this point, I‚Äôm struggling with whether there‚Äôs an important difference in the long arc of history.

Sorry this was maybe confusing - I have this mental battle with myself like, once every week now.

I have so far lived all of my life as a girl, and for the most part I am comfortable with my femininity and ""being a woman"" and use she/her pronouns without issue. But although I feel like a woman most of the time, sometimes I really don't care that much about feeling like nothing at all and straying beyond the gender binary. I never feel like a man, but sometimes I feel like something somewhere between the gender binary that isn't quite a woman. 

I have always worn clothes that are a mixture of feminine and masculine and I often buy clothes from the men's section because I just prefer the look of them sometimes and can't find anything similar in the women's section, which can sometimes be a bit too femme for me, even though on some days I'm femme as fuck. I've always just worn what I want and what I think looks good on me and tend to not gender clothing that much. Often people will point out that what I'm wearing ""looks masculine"" and I won't have even realised.

I like being a woman, but I find gender quite restrictive, both systemically and in terms of more superficial things like clothes, makeup, personal hygiene rituals, all things that tend to cost more and require a lot more work and money. I've grown my armpit hair and leg hair out a few times and felt really empowered by expressing that natural part of me that I don't get to show if I fully embrace traditional femininity. My mother tended to buy me extremely feminine clothing when I was a kid, and though I never had a problem with being a girl, I sometimes felt restricted and uncomfortable whenever she forced me to wear frilly, long, pink dresses. When I got a little older she always discouraged me from spending my money on clothes that looked ""too masculine"" and it always really bothered me. 

For the most part I am comfortable with my body in terms of gender. But I have large boobs: sometimes I love them (when I'm feeling really femme) and other times I wish I could just cut them off or at least squish them up in a binder so that I can have a completely flat chest because I love how it looks - a ""masculine"" chest under loose, feminine clothing. 

Sometimes I feel like a woman, and sometimes I feel like nothing at all. Is this what being non binary feels like for some people? Is there a word for what I feel or a type of gender identity that describes what I'm feeling?

Man, I just want someone who's on the same page as me anymore. I want openness. I want trust. I don't want lies anymore. I want EQUAL effort to be put toward the relationship.. I'm tired of people using me.

I feel like being nonbinary (trans guy), having diagnosed OCD, anxiety, depression, and chronic fatigue/pain, as well as having some past life beliefs really narrows my dating pool. It's depressing.

I'm not very fluent in the verbal etiquette surrounding gender so I apologize in advance if I use any dated terms or offensive language, everything in this post is meant to convey and question ideas and feelings with no intent to harm or alienate anyone.

I'm struggling to come to terms with some feelings and I'm hoping that you all can help me with a dilemma. I was born male, I havent really questioned my gender nor my physical body and I'm comfortable with any and all pronouns. However, as time goes on, the binary gender system starts to hold less meaning and significance in my life. My identity doesnt hinge on being male and when I look into myself and question who am I, I dont feel the need to specify male, or any gender at all. I understand my body and the parts that I have and I feel no need to change them. In fact, because I underwent a circumcision at the age of 17, it actually horrifies me personally. I would do anything to have that part of me back.


For me, when I look at my body, I dont see a males body, I see a human body that went a particular direction during prenatal development. Internally, I feel genderless, like I can flow freely on the gender spectrum depending on how I feel in a given moment. I would say that I present male, but only because I still keep a beard and most of my clothes are stereotypically male.  To me, my clothes are unisex and my facial hair is a natural cycle that my body takes.To the onlooker, I'm male and im okay with that generalization and the accompanying pronouns, but if someone asked I feel more comfortable responding with a genderless based response.


What I want to know is, is the approach I take towards my gender identity a form of ""Gender Appropriation""? I feel like as a male who stereotypically presents as male that I'm not entitled to the feelings of being genderless, that I'm taking on the perks to a persecuted group without experiencing the obstacles and marginalization that for example a male transitioning to a female would experience.

On the other hand, I know how I feel internally and perhaps I'm just gatekeeping myself? I dont know, I just dont want to appear as though I'm hopping on the bandwagon, and I definitely dont want to alienate anyone who feels more strongly about their gender/body dysphoria than I do, so I tend to keep this to myself.

They dressed you  
in shades of pink and blue

Everywhere  
The shades of pink  
And shades of blue  
It was everywhere

So little colour  
It was all too much  
and all too little

Yet somehow  
only you could see  
All the colours  
everyone had missed

So you tried to paint the world  
to fill it in with missing colours

Yet as soon as you dipped your brush  
in pots of green  
and yellow  
and silver  
and red

They had lived so long  
and seen so little  
and got so angry when you tried to change

They broke your brushes  
Tore your canvas  
Spilled your paint  
Beat it all into the ground

Yet little did they know  
Soon  
The flowers bloomed  
With so much colour  
With everything that was missing

Others saw  
Others rejoiced  
Others dressed in orange  
and purple  
and gold  
Others danced in white  
and bronze  
And you danced with them

They couldn‚Äôt change themselves  
They couldn‚Äôt change  
that others had seen true colour

No matter how much they beat  
the colour into the ground  
The flowers kept blossoming

Filling the world  
with colours

Just a few moments ago, I was writing a text post asking about how I can come out to my parents.

Recently my parents found out I'm a liberal, and that had them up in arms, yelling at me about how I'm wrong about everything.

I made the mistake of bringing up the LGBTQ community, I'm a flamboyant person, and I have some non conforming items in my room, so they had some serious suspicions.

My mom asked today: ""Is there anything else you want to admit?"" 

I was already so emotional from all the arguing that I just blubbered like a baby. ""N-no, I don't really want to talk about it""

She gave me a disdainful look and stormed off.

Just moments ago I was writing on here of how I can reclaim this time and come out on my terms, without being dragged out of the closet.

But then my mom came in as I was writing, ""Are you a part of that? That 'community'?"" I said I was... I blubbered out that I am Pan and Nonbinary. She looked disgusted and stormed away.

I had to go over to her apartment to help her de-clutter my late father‚Äôs Abominable AV setup (a non-functional nightmare for another tale). As usual, we ended up talking about twenty million things that are going on, and I found an opportunity within that to bring up the gender thing. 

She didn‚Äôt quite understand at first‚Äînot surprising, since non-binary is a relatively new classification‚Äîbut she was quite accepting of it with more explanation. She said that as long as my spouse and I are satisfied and happy with it, that‚Äôs what mattered. Yay for validation!

She asked me to write down some of the terms so she could read more about it. I pointed her to a few good resources for information.

I've been wondering about the main differences between enby and trans for a while now. I was hoping maybe some of you could elaborate how you experience being enby as opposed to being trans?

I've got some questions below, they're mostly meant as subjects that I'm curious about, but also feel free to write your thoughts down without answering all of those questions specifically. Any insights are helpful.

* What's in your experience the main difference between being enby and trans?
* How did you come to find out you were enby? Before you found out, have you ever had doubts that you might've been trans instead?
* I've learned that being enby can mean looking more androgenous. Are there ever days where you are more on one side of a gender than on the other side? Like, looking super feminine on day A and maybe look very masculine a few days later? Does it fluctuate or do you have a preference of certain mixed aspects?
* Whenever you feel more towards one side of the gender spectrum than the other, do you make a point out of it to look passing?
* Do you prefer to wear gender neutral clothing, or gender specific clothing?
* Do you experience gender dysphoria? If so, to what extent, and do you ever feel uncomfortable about your own body?

I'm sorry if these questions seem really random or specific, but I'm trying to find out my own gender identity. It has been a long journey, but so far I've managed to narrow it down to either trans or enby. I think if I could get some answers to these questions that might clear things up further for me.

2020-06-07 04:05:51,gy5kt5,0,1,"Hi everyone, Happy Pride Month! üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà

It seemed unfair to us that most of the modern breakthrough of LGBTQ dating centered around simply gathering the community in one place. Although much needed as a crucial first step, LGBTQ singles are still left to their own devices in what remains a dating stone age.

It almost feels like people assume the dating struggle ends just by bringing LGBTQ people together.

But like with other singles, regardless of sexual orientation or gender, personality plays a role in attraction and compatibility.

It's not just about bringing any two LGBTQ singles together.

It‚Äôs about finding the people that‚Äôll effortlessly love, appreciate, and understand us for who we naturally are. Feeling that undeniable spark of chemistry when you know you‚Äôre with the right person. Someone who is everything you‚Äôre not, yet somehow just the same.

We were tired of seeing our friends heartbroken over failed relationships; ending up with the wrong people whose values were incompatible with their own; struggling to communicate in a relationship in which their differences seemed greater than their willingness to compromise; and constantly worrying about whether they will be liked for who they are.

The reality is, the problem isn‚Äôt them. And neither is it you. It‚Äôs a misalignment of people who see the world fundamentally differently. We believe there is someone for everyone. What one person may misunderstand and see in you as the worst thing ever, another will appreciate and see in you what they‚Äôve been waiting for all this time. Yes, despite all your flaws, there is someone that will see them as the best possible flaws to have in light of your best traits. And we‚Äôll tell you who, and why.

Many LGBTQ centered apps are also unfortunately purely about hooking up and don't help to find deeper and meaningful connections.

That's why we created Boo, the personality based dating app.

We just launched Boo not too long ago and made Boo LGBTQ friendly with the option of a non-binary gender option.

We wanted to play our part in expanding access to the best in personality based dating to LGBTQ singles.

Here's a link to our website, from which you can download the app: [https://boo.dating](https://boo.dating/)

I hope you like it, and please share any feedback below in the comments so we can improve on the product and experience!

I‚Äôm not really sure where to post this, or if it should even go here. I hope you don‚Äôt mind that I‚Äôm using my secondary reddit account. I‚Äôm really nervous talking about this.

I never used to mind being labeled a girl, mainly because I used to view it just with liking feminine things.

So What?](https://youtu.be/MfaLQEW7xdY) is the latest video by [Kat Blaque](https://twitter.com/kat_blaque) a trans-woman YouTuber who back in the day did initially identify as non-binary but now remains a strong ally to us.  In this video Kat Blaque makes the argument that JK Rowling is a transphobe and not an ally to people such as herself and non-binary people and that we all should just go find other books that reflEct ourselves and values.

Personally I‚Äôm not very attached to any of these books but I do like fantasy.  I‚Äôve tried to find fantasy books with specifically non-binary or trans characters but have not had such luck.

So I was wondering what everyone‚Äôs favourite fantasy books are and if anyone knows of any positive representation.  And maybe discuss ideas on how we should be represented in stories.  What would be your self-insert character be like?

Personally at a bare minimum I would want the character to be human, not a werewolf, vampire or other mystical creature.  I think I would be fine with elves or dwarves tho.

I really do think that fantasy is the best place to represent people such as us, and maybe sci-fi is better Suited.  In any case looking outside of books I‚Äôve always been a big fan of the gender-fluid appearances of the Gelflings in the Dark Crystal series and how societal roles are not too gendered, tho it is still obviously an openly matriarchal society but that‚Äôs cool too because thats a very rare occurrence in stories.  Also when I was a kid I remember feeling a very profound connection by the character Mulan.  A lot of fans, mainly woman have said that this film was important because it showed that women can do whatever a man can do, and I agree with that and think its wonderful, but for me what I related to was how Mulan was Blatantly not able to conform to society‚Äôs binary boxes and in the end was able to prove that those boxes are useless by essentially saving her father.

I'm... somewhat clear? on my sexual identity (and have recently lost any confidence in my gender identity). However, when it comes to labels, I struggle. If this is relatable to any of you, I'd appreciate some guidance. If necessary, I'm alright with providing more detailed background info.

2020-06-09 01:29:29,gzd2l1,6,4,"Hey everyone,
this is my first post ever on reddit, so to be honest, I don't know how to start.

So just to start, I have to begin somewhere I guess, I'am  19yo,Male(?), Pan and in a relationship with my Boyfriend (a FtM Trans* Person), we are dating for 7 Months now and I am really happy, BUT:

 I have difficulties to find out my Gender-Identity.

I'm struggling with this for more than 2 years, but bec of a homophobic father, and other circumstances I couldn't focus on this as much as I liked it to be.

But I am getting off topic here.

For several years I was experiencing small amounts of dysphoria(social and physical), and over the last months it is growing more and more intense.

Sometimes, I just stand in front of my mirror and get angry, upset and dissatisfied about my whole appearance and so on, and even cry about it but no self harm or something like this.But at other days I am so afraid, that I might not have enough dysphoria to be ""the real thing"", to be a valid trans* person.I supported my Boyfriend and experienced his dysphoria attacks and sometimes it's hard to acknowledge my own dysphoria, but I know, that one's dysphoria is barely comparable to another's.

The root of this insecurity lies in the complexity of my feelings and fears related to my gender-identity.

I really don't fully feel like a male person, but a small part of me does, a part of me feels drawn towards demigender(male and female) but the majority of me feel like a non-binary entity.

So as you can clearly see, this confusing mess of my identification really makes it hard for me to clearly identify myself and pick a label or a path for myself to create an environment with as less dysphoria as possible, because the dominant identification changes sometimes and when I built something for this part of me, and I ""switch"" the part which is now dominant experiences severe dysphoria when confronted with this unfitting setting.

And because of this pool of identifications in which the dominant part sometimes changes I feel less valid then other people and seeing other Trans * people in social media and elsewhere makes it sometimes really hard to feel valid and real, because sometimes there is a voice in the back of my mind, telling me that I am only seeking attention etc. yada yada.

I managed to talk to my s/o about my dysphoria and rising level of awareness of my own transformation in gender terms.

He's really understanding, and supports me no matter as  what I will identify in the future and I am so grateful, to have him at my side,and it really helps.

Has someone made similar experiences or can  maybe dish out some advise about strengthening my  self esteem(validation), how to deal with my dysphoria and identification/labeling(suggestions?).

Feel free to comment here or in my DMs, I really hope to make some new friends here, to help each other out etc.

Thanks in advance,
Phil(Him/He to keep it simple XD)

I have a pretty small chest for an AFAB person and while it isn‚Äôt entirely concealed under the compression sports bras I usually wear, it‚Äôs not visible enough to bother me on most days.

I'm AFAB, but I've always been kinda ""masculine"". As a child, I hated dresses and preferred clothing from the men's section, shorter hair, and ""male"" interests. I am aware these things do not necessarily mean that I'm not cis, but these are my first experiences with questioning my gender and I thought they were important to include. In my early teens, around the time of puberty, I started to hate how feminine my body was becoming. I hated my chest, which is sometimes a thing that cis women experience, but I hated it BECAUSE it was feminine. I didn't feel female, so I didn't want female sex characteristics. I was young and frustrated, so I just gave up on figuring out my gender. I decided to just call myself a girl even though it didn't feel right.

Fast forward to now. I'm an adult, and I'm finally ready to question my gender after years of identifying as a cis female. Sometimes I absolutely despise my body as well as any association with being female. But other times I'm completely fine with looking, dressing, acting, and being a woman. I rarely feel male, it's almost always either female or neither. Not sure if that matters or not.

 Can I be nonbinary and still sometimes be okay with being a woman? Or does it just sound like I'm a cis woman who doesn't like gender stereotypes? Is it possible for me to switch between feeling female and neither female nor male, and if so is that what genderfluid is?

Hi everyone, I'm 21 AFAB and I've been exploring my sexuality for a while and I know I'm aroace (for context) but now I'm exploring my gender. The reason I bring up my sexuality is because I might be confusing not wanting people to see me as ""sexy"" with not aligning with my current gender? I guess? (also I know this isn't true for all aroaces; just for me in this context!)

Some advice I'd like is what things can I do to understand my gender better? I've recently made a twitter account with a new name and they/them pronouns to see if I like being addressed that way, but I don't know what else I can do to figure it out.

Background: I've identified as female my whole life and I'm fine with she/her pronouns. I guess I'd be okay with being addressed as they/them although I'm not sure, that's what that twitter account is for, but I would definitely not be comfortable being addressed as he/him. When I was growing up I didn't have a lot of friends, but I just hung out with whoever wanted to spend time with me regardless of their gender. In high school I had a guy friend group and a girl friend group that I hung out with consistently. Before high school I dressed sort of androgynously, and in high school I wore more feminine clothing to fit in with my gender, but now I dress more androgynously than I ever have. I like to wear baggy shirts and hoodies with skinny jeans and either vans or converse. I despise wearing dresses and skirts because they're uncomfortable, and I hate wearing heels because they hurt. I only wear makeup when I leave the house and it's just enough to make my face the same color, since I have rosacea. As hobbies I like to play guitar, dance, play videogames and watch Youtube.   I don't really have dysphoria; I couldn't care less what my body looks like.

I brought up my sexuality for two reasons. One is that I find some descriptions of male and female genders to be sexualized, and being aroace it's hard for me to comprehend what those gender roles mean to me. Secondly, I don't want to be seen as a sex object by others and I get uncomfortable when people flirt with me, so maybe me dressing less feminine has something to do with that? I'm highly confused if my gender identity ( = ?) aligns with my gender expression ( = not exposing my skin when out, wearing baggier clothes, etc.)

Lastly, I'm confused because I don't know what ""feeling female"" or ""feeling male"" or not feeling either really means. I think I'm confused about what it really MEANS to be female or to be male or to not be either, or be both, or be some other gender.

I'm a 19 yo AFAB and I think I'm either agender/bigender/genderflu√Ød/gnc, didn't pick a label yet but I'm sure I'm not cis.

2020-06-09 08:11:32,gziu4b,0,7,"**WARNING**: This is a very long read, but to be honest I'm not sure how to TL;DR it. 

Basically, I have too much on my mind about my life and my gender. So I'm posting this, in hopes that I can get some closure and not feel so alone. And if anyone else feels a little less lonely after reading this mess, then I will feel that I've accomplished something special! 


I think back on my time as a transgender individual a lot. In fact, I think about the thoughts of myself‚Ä¶ a lot. It's probably just another example of how paranoid I am that I'm unable to know the person I‚Äôve become.

I people watch. Maybe because I‚Äôm scared, maybe because I want to see if they‚Äôre looking at me, maybe to prepare myself for if they do talk to me, or maybe to simply be inspired by their existence.

I think that a lot of the things that I have done in order to understand myself is largely because I DID take inspiration from the people around me.

And, maybe I didn‚Äôt pay attention to the people closest to me because they didn't give me anything that I wanted to be. Most of them were catty and superficial and horrible. To their friends, to their significant others, and to me.

My mother wasn‚Äôt a role model to me, she smoked constantly and wasn‚Äôt all that reliable. She handled my basic needs and she gave me attention, maybe‚Ä¶ But she wasn‚Äôt a person I liked. Or a person I could see myself becoming. The only thing we share are our looks, and even that‚Äôs about to change drastically.

My birth father left my mother and I when I was very young, not that my step/adoptive father would be much more of a dad. (I won‚Äôt get into the details because, honestly, it‚Äôs a clusterfuck and just more proof of how much my family lies to me.)

My grandma and grandpa were the only physical, positive influences in my life. Grandma read me stories and introduced me to Disney, who remains to be one of my inspirations when it comes to my own stories and drawings. I like to think that I gained the ability to care so much about people because of her. And I share my grandpa's eyes and freckles, but I don't remember much about him beside him constantly being at my side until cancer took his life. I still miss him desperately.

I spent most of my young life uprooted, scared, confused, and psychotic. Left to fruitlessly attempt to make sense of the early stages of schizophrenia, with no adults taking me seriously and writing me off as just ""a deeply imaginative child.""

The only saving grace I had during the formative years of my life was Link, who is a male character. Not that this ever occurred to me. I was motivated by his heroic spirit and the person he was, how he helped people and fearlessly overcame his challenges. Ever since I picked up Twilight Princess back in 2006, I looked forward to the next game I could acquire to know my Hero again and see if I could truly grow up to be like him.

There were plenty of other characters I found and were later compared to. (On multiple occasions I reminded several people of Roxas, somehow.) But none of them compared to Link. Who was a person I pretended to be until the traits that attracted me to him in first place found themselves within me. Even to this day I find myself asking something of the proverbial ‚ÄúWhat would Link do?‚Äù whenever I‚Äôm in serious trouble or scared to move forward. 

(However, if a game like Hellblade: Senua‚Äôs Sacrifice came out during these years, there couldn‚Äôt be a better character than Senua to be a role model to my terrified younger self. But I count my stars that Link came into my life when I needed him.)

I was largely ignored throughout my elementary years because of many many things. (I had/have a hearing problem and my psychotic episodes were enough to drive anyone away.) 

So, I would imagine that some lonely, ghost girl would attract a lot of attention when her personality does a total 180. And I guess because I acted out this adventurous, IDGAF attitude that my peers started befriending me. I quickly learned never to give away my hallucinations ever again, for the sake of never being lonely again.

I definitely got along more with the guys instead of the girls when it came to my peers, but it never really occurred to me that it would be a problem. I was too ecstatic that I was making friends to be bothered by much of anything. 

I wore whatever my mom wanted of me, (which was overly feminine) but I played with toys, games, and people from both sexes. I engaged in games of house with my female friends, and did stupid stunts and roughhoused with my male friends. Maybe I was occasionally confused when my mom ‚Äúcorrected‚Äù me on things. (Like violently urging me to ‚Äúsit like a lady‚Äù whenever she caught me not doing so.) But I never really questioned it further.

Problems didn‚Äôt start truly arising until Jr. High. My condition was getting worse, even though I continued to ignore it as best I could, and I was relentlessly bullied. The way people treated me made me wonder if there was something chronically wrong with me no matter what I did. 

My mom controlled how I looked for the first week, but after that, it was all up to me. I never really cared what I looked like. I wore ripped jeans and hoodies nearly every day, and my hair, which was very long at the time, was either hanging loosely around my face or up in a ponytail. I was teased for looking like a boy with long hair and having a deeper voice than other girls. I never really grew into a WOMANLY body and I refused to wear things that showed this off. Not so much because it made me uncomfortable, but because I never saw the appeal. (Though, I did start getting uncomfortable when... certain experiences happened, such as having my bra straps snapped when I started needing to wear one.)

I started becoming romantically interested in people, but I didn‚Äôt care what sex they were. I had many bad relationships with both guys and girls, and none of those relationships did much to help me through the confusion that was not understanding what I **FELT** I was. (My girlfriends called me their boyfriend and that felt good, same with being called a girlfriend by my boyfriends. So FML)

Jr. High was singlehandedly the worst two years of my life. You COULD NOT pay me enough money to relive that hell. What those years put me through has scarred me forever and was the beginning of the end of my honest sense of self. 

After going to public schools all my life, going to a Catholic high school was the final nail in the coffin. I wasn‚Äôt allowed to re-discover myself or explore my self-expression. And, after following ill-fated advice from my mother, I went to this new school with 14 inches of my hair chopped off my head. I tried my hardest to follow the stereotypical female mold that surrounded me by wearing a skirt constantly and forcing myself to learn how to put on makeup. I forged a new personality that ‚Äúbetter suited my sex‚Äù as well.  

Thankfully, my now husband, who I met during these years, saw right through my bullshit. 

During this time, I became acutely aware of things that were part of my anatomy that I never was too aware of before. Mostly from other people mentioning things about me. Women would complement things like how thin I was or how small my nose is, and men would comment about my skirt or my chest. I equated compliments with an off-hand threat or an indirect demand for something else in return.

And‚Ä¶ in retrospect, I think that this desperate focus on being super feminine against my own wishes made me look to men out of envy and frustration. I started romanticizing their experience in the world and their apparent ability to just ‚Äúexist‚Äù without having to care about their appearance. And maybe I started to covet the way a guy seemed to command attention when he walked into the room. (Clearly, I didn‚Äôt pay attention to the existence of guys who weren‚Äôt boisterous, cuz I‚Äôm sure there were guys who kept to themselves just as much as I did.) This mentality carried on to the way I saw my husband, who didn‚Äôt understand why I thought ‚Äúthe grass was greener‚Äù on his side of the world.

When I escaped Hell Two: Electric Boogaloo and I was able to express myself freely again, I lost whatever was left of my sanity. All the things I focused on became this unholy amalgamation of hyper-idealized masculinity that I wanted to personify. And this‚Ä¶ persona closely resembled one of my old characters, whose name is Rolf. During this whole mess, I gave myself comfort in believing I was ‚Äúmaking Rolf a reality.‚Äù

There were things I did during this whole thing that I ended up not regretting, such as my piercings and my tattoos. But I admit that the main inspiration at the time was to make myself more ‚Äútough-looking‚Äù and ‚Äúmanly.‚Äù (bleh) But the biggest mistake I made was cutting my hair AGAIN. Because clearly, I didn‚Äôt learn the first time. 

Basically, I neglected to do proper research on the haircut I was getting and combined it with an older hair stylist. Put those together and you get a completely horrified (not to mention, psychotic) young person, staring at a mullet that was supposed to be a ‚Äúscene‚Äù haircut. The cut hardly lasted an hour before I went home, slapped on a beanie, and cut around it. When I looked in the mirror, I saw what I always imagined Rolf would look like and I guess I was completely in love.

Cue three years of absolute, hair-ripping bullshit in which I was fully convinced I was meant to be a man and that Rolf, my past experiences, and my current tendencies were proof of it. I count my stars that I was able to pull myself through before any real damage resulted from it. 

Clarification, I **AM NOT** dissing on anyone who engaged in HRT or SRS and I am ecstatic it worked for you! But given what I know now, I would have ultimately regretted doing such things had I plowed directly into it.  

After struggling for as long as I have, I am finally diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder, which clears up so much of the horrible things I‚Äôve experienced but could never explain. And after seeking out therapy/medication, I have been able to target the source of my fear, my confusion, my loneliness, and my pain. (And it‚Äôs why I‚Äôm now HEAVILY pro-therapy.) I am currently working hard to regain the image of my physical body that my past would be proud of. (Because, let‚Äôs face it, no surgery in the world will help me achieve my true goals haha.) And, ultimately, I‚Äôm turning my energies to helping people as much as I can by pursuing a degree in psychology and philosophy. 

After all of this, I know I have an edge at understanding just how terrible things are right now. The world is falling apart, people are getting hurt, and it‚Äôs harder than ever to be honest about who/what you are. If I can become a therapist to alleviate that even a little bit, I will consider my life well lived. 

I guess that, besides getting this huge weight off my shoulders, I want everyone here to know that it REALLY does get better. You eventually find the solutions to your identity and everything makes sense eventually. You just have to keep going at it, follow where your heart takes you, and choose your eggs carefully. 

I'm sorry for dumping all of this. But I felt the need to bare my Soul tonight. I hope you understand.",NonBinary,"So, I wanted to rant a little bit.

2020-06-09 17:06:10,gzr8wc,0,2,"Good Morning, Reddit!

Just needed to vent about something that really bothered me this morning. I am an AFAB person and have used an IUD for the last 5 years now. At the time, I did not have insurance, but since I live in WA, the visit was completely free thru Planned Parenthood. Additionally, though I couldn‚Äôt speak to their ability to provide care to trans &amp;non-binary people as I was still identifying as a woman at the time, my doctors and staff were extremely friendly and welcoming. I had a really positive experience. 

Fast forward to today when I realize that it‚Äôs time to have my IUD replaced. So I scheduled my appointment online with the same PP clinic I had my current one placed at. Haven‚Äôt had my legal name changed which always sucks (my insurance provider‚Äôs member services apparently requires their employees to call you ma‚Äôam at every opportunity despite the many times I‚Äôve asked to make a note not to), but PP asks for your chosen name as well as your pronouns and has adaptive nearly all of their verbiage to be more respectful of trans and non-binary people who need to access gynecological services. However, once I got to my appointment, reception informed me that my insurance (which is a catastrophic plan that runs nearly $300 a month) basically bans people from seeing other providers even though they provide the crappiest services. Don‚Äôt even get me started on their mental health department... I would have had to pay $500 out of pocket to have my IUD replaced. Shoutout to the front desk employees who went OUT OF THEIR WAY to see if there were any loopholes/ways around the system for me. Planned parenthood: 10/10 

So now I have to make an appointment w/my health insurance provider‚Äôs office. 

1. You cannot schedule an appointment online. To see a ‚Äòspecialist‚Äô which a gynecologist is, you have to call your primary physician to get a referral and then you can call the ‚ÄòWomen‚Äôs Health Department‚Äô to schedule your appointment. 

2. Under list of specialties, rather than ‚ÄòSexual Health specialties‚Äô or ‚Äògynecological specialties‚Äô or ‚Äòobstetrics specialties‚Äô they continue to use ‚ÄòWomen‚Äôs Health.‚Äô It is extremely frustrating that I am prohibited from seeing doctor‚Äôs/using a facility that validates my identity to be met with a system that is actively dysphoric. A company that hasn‚Äôt even attempted to change their verbiage surely can‚Äôt be making any attempts to train and ensure their employees and physicians are respectful and knowledgeable of trans and non-binary identities. 

3. Women‚Äôs Health directs you to Sexual Health which THEN directs you to Transgender, Lesbian, and Bisexual Health... 
They have a really nice, flowery FAQ on transgender identities and why it‚Äôs important to manage your stress and how to support loved ones who are transgendered. They mention ‚Äúnon-binary‚Äù exactly once and out it in quotes like it‚Äôs not ‚Äúnot really real.‚Äù 

But if they know that it‚Äôs important to validate and respect trans people... why do they call the department ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs health‚Äù seemingly knowing full well that we aren‚Äôt women. Why, when by Women‚Äôs Health they usually mean AFAB Health, are they including trans women? Also, I‚Äôm sure some may disagree with me (and I‚Äôd love to hear your opinions), but I don‚Äôt appreciate healthcare lumping gender identities and sexual identities together. I think cis/het people often conflate the two in problematic ways that can be invalidating (I had a coworker who couldn‚Äôt wrap his mind around that fact that his straight cis male friend was still straight ‚Äúeven though his girlfriend is {trans}‚Äù (he didn‚Äôt use ‚Äòtrans‚Äô)

Anyway, thanks for reading this rant. I hope you‚Äôre all staying safe out there!",NonBinary,‚ÄòWomen‚Äôs Health‚Äô,1591747570.0,"{'created_utc': 1591722370, 'id': 'gzr8wc', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 2, 'selftext': 'Good Morning, Reddit!\n\nJust needed to vent about something that really bothered me this morning. I am an AFAB person and have used an IUD for the last 5 years now. At the time, I did not have insurance, but since I live in WA, the visit was completely free thru Planned Parenthood. Additionally, though I couldn‚Äôt speak to their ability to provide care to trans &amp;non-binary people as I was still identifying as a woman at the time, my doctors and staff were extremely friendly and welcoming. I had a really positive experience. \n\nFast forward to today when I realize that it‚Äôs time to have my IUD replaced. So I scheduled my appointment online with the same PP clinic I had my current one placed at. Haven‚Äôt had my legal name changed which always sucks (my insurance provider‚Äôs member services apparently requires their employees to call you ma‚Äôam at every opportunity despite the many times I‚Äôve asked to make a note not to), but PP asks for your chosen name as well as your pronouns and has adaptive nearly all of their verbiage to be more respectful of trans and non-binary people who need to access gynecological services. However, once I got to my appointment, reception informed me that my insurance (which is a catastrophic plan that runs nearly $300 a month) basically bans people from seeing other providers even though they provide the crappiest services. Don‚Äôt even get me started on their mental health department... I would have had to pay $500 out of pocket to have my IUD replaced. Shoutout to the front desk employees who went OUT OF THEIR WAY to see if there were any loopholes/ways around the system for me. Planned parenthood: 10/10 \n\nSo now I have to make an appointment w/my health insurance provider‚Äôs office. \n\n1. You cannot schedule an appointment online. To see a ‚Äòspecialist‚Äô which a gynecologist is, you have to call your primary physician to get a referral and then you can call the ‚ÄòWomen‚Äôs Health Department‚Äô to schedule your appointment. \n\n2. Under list of specialties, rather than ‚ÄòSexual Health specialties‚Äô or ‚Äògynecological specialties‚Äô or ‚Äòobstetrics specialties‚Äô they continue to use ‚ÄòWomen‚Äôs Health.‚Äô It is extremely frustrating that I am prohibited from seeing doctor‚Äôs/using a facility that validates my identity to be met with a system that is actively dysphoric. A company that hasn‚Äôt even attempted to change their verbiage surely can‚Äôt be making any attempts to train and ensure their employees and physicians are respectful and knowledgeable of trans and non-binary identities. \n\n3. Women‚Äôs Health directs you to Sexual Health which THEN directs you to Transgender, Lesbian, and Bisexual Health... \nThey have a really nice, flowery FAQ on transgender identities and why it‚Äôs important to manage your stress and how to support loved ones who are transgendered. They mention ‚Äúnon-binary‚Äù exactly once and out it in quotes like it‚Äôs not ‚Äúnot really real.‚Äù \n\nBut if they know that it‚Äôs important to validate and respect trans people... why do they call the department ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs health‚Äù seemingly knowing full well that we aren‚Äôt women. Why, when by Women‚Äôs Health they usually mean AFAB Health, are they including trans women? Also, I‚Äôm sure some may disagree with me (and I‚Äôd love to hear your opinions), but I don‚Äôt appreciate healthcare lumping gender identities and sexual identities together. I think cis/het people often conflate the two in problematic ways that can be invalidating (I had a coworker who couldn‚Äôt wrap his mind around that fact that his straight cis male friend was still straight ‚Äúeven though his girlfriend is {trans}‚Äù (he didn‚Äôt use ‚Äòtrans‚Äô) \n\n3.

2020-06-09 21:53:36,gzx6jx,1,2,"Hey all you non-binary people! I hope your week has started off well.

I have a question which I thought would be best posed here. I assume this question is asked time and time again, so I‚Äôm sorry in advance! Also, I am not extremely well educated in gender identity politics. If I say something incorrect, it‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm trying to be mean or devalue anyone. If I should change how I say certain things in this post, please let me know.

I identify as a man and have lived as a man for all of my 32 years. I am also gay and white, just to throw it out there.

I am feeling the urge to reject my identity as a man.

The thing that I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about is that I ultimately don‚Äôt have an urge to feminize anything about myself (given that I define my current expression as masculine). I am probably incorrect, but it is my impression that non-binary people‚Äîand to generalize out to trans people‚Äîwill change their gender expression once they adopt their gender label. What I mean by this is, well let‚Äôs bring up Natalie Wynn aka contrapoints. She adopted the trans and woman identity and physically changed her presentation to fit the labels she now uses to define herself. To be more blunt, she used to identify as a man, so she presented herself how society says men should present themselves. But now that she identifies as a woman, she does things like wear makeup, wear women‚Äôs clothes to signify that she‚Äôs a woman.

This seems different from me when I say I want to reject my identity as a man. I don‚Äôt necessarily want to change anything about my presentation. I like the things that my human body does (e.g. growing facial hair). My first thoughts about rejecting my male identity was to do something anti-male. And the anti-male is female. So I thought maybe I could try doing female things and see how that makes me feel. I bought makeup and tried painting my face but I really didn‚Äôt enjoy it. I tried painting my nails, and that‚Äôs cool and all, but I‚Äôm just not into materialistic things like that. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs invalid or anything; lots of people find makeup and beauty products to be a powerful tool in their lives and that‚Äôs awesome. But what I‚Äôm getting at is I don‚Äôt want to reject one gender label to pick up another gender label, or to reject one gender expression to pick up another gender expression.

I just don‚Äôt want to play or be a part of the gender game in its entirety. I want to be outside of gender. I want to be able to do all human things and experience all human experiences just as a person, not as a man.

I hope it‚Äôs not offensive saying gender is a game. I know that being able to transition saves trans people‚Äôs lives and I don‚Äôt want to devalue that. I also know that I have experienced a great amount of privilege living my life as a white man.

But what I‚Äôm getting at is I don‚Äôt want to reject one gender label to pick up another gender label, or to reject one gender expression to pick up another gender expression.\n\nI just don‚Äôt want to play or be a part of the gender game in its entirety. I want to be outside of gender. I want to be able to do all human things and experience all human experiences just as a person, not as a man.\n\nI hope it‚Äôs not offensive saying gender is a game. I know that being able to transition saves trans people‚Äôs lives and I don‚Äôt want to devalue that. I also know that I have experienced a great amount of privilege living my life as a white man.\n\nSo basically, how can I live outside of gender?

I discussed hormones and top surgery with my mom, but due to corona it‚Äôs talking a lot to get this all set up. Also because of corona, I am lacking the ability to go out and get things like new clothes. I have a binder my friend bought, but that only does so much with the things I have in my closet. A lot of it is super feminine because prior I mistook my dysphoria for just low self esteem because I thought I was ugly (not ugly just not my body) so I tried to be really feminine and yeah now I‚Äôm screwed. Everything is closed and family is really discouraging me from going out due to my health, and because they‚Äôre hardly working we don‚Äôt really have the funds to get me new things. I am trying to get a job, but at 17 it‚Äôs so hard because 1) no one hires minors anymore 2) I don‚Äôt drive so it has to be somewhere near me I can walk. Right now I have a good chance at Starbucks but I‚Äôm not sure.

2020-06-10 04:58:10,h044l4,1,2,"This is my first post here. Until today I had closed myself off from the queer community. This was an unconscious decision made by me a while ago and I think it has made my life worse than it could have been. 

Okay I need to start at the beginning. I'll try not to make this too long lol

When I graduated HS I started questioning my gender identity: wearing a chest binder and cutting my hair short. It was invigorating and made me feel more like myself. I lived in a small rural town where there was and is not accepting of anything ""new"" (disclaimer, none of this is new in humanity, just newly integrating into mainstream acceptance). 

So I moved out and went to college. The college I went to is super liberal and the dorm I was in was a gender equity floor. Basically nothing was gendered: rooms, bayhrooms, showers were all open to anyone (still had stalls and curtains). I thought this would be my chance to embrace and figure out my identity. However, about half of the population of this dorm were very toxic, mean and uninviting to CIS people. 

At this point I was confused and scared, because thats not the kind of person I wanted to be. I had always been the open, loving, accepting person for all of my friends and this seemed wrong. So I stopped. I threw put my binder and grew my hair back out. Because it seemed a better option than turning into what I was seeing. So I shoved it all down so far that I forgot about it. 

Many years of terrible relationships with men who wanted me to be more feminine (yes, I know I should've fought back on that but mental health issues basically prevented me from caring about myself more than what others thought). Eventually I was so fed up with a bad relationship that I stated doing what I wanted again and cut my hair off. It was wonderful and liberating. 

I moved back home after that and made a wonderful friend (who I am now in a great relationship with) and we talked a lot about being yourself and expressing your own personality. Basically it was great. I felt loved and accepted, but still shoved those other feelings down. The ones about my body and how out of place I felt in it.  This whole time I've been having issues with food and how it made me feel. 

Today I was listening to a podcast about someone going through a lot of what I have been going through who ended up identifying as nonbinary and getting surgery etc. 

It broke me. 

Every ounce of emotion that I had bottled up or shoved to the side came bubbling back up. I dont like my body. It doesn't feel like me. It feels wrong. 

I don't know how I have been able to shove all of these emotions down, because right now they are so strong. 

Facts that I know: I don't feel like a CIS female. I dont care about pronouns. I love my genitals. I hate my boobs.

I apologize if this post is not formatted well or doesn't make sense. I am in a messy state of mind and I hope you can understand.

Over the last few months I've come to the conclusion that I'm probably agender but I don't think for reasons that are that widely-spread. I'm amab and because of my long hair and feminine facial features before puberty really hit, I was regulalry gendered with female pronouns or caused uncertainty with my androgynous appearance for years from when I was 11 up to when I was 16/17. So from that alone I always had the internal perception that language features such as pronouns are completely useless bullshit and that there would be no disatvantage to just abolishing that and using they/them for everything. There's only one problem with that.

I live in Germany and our language doesn't have a gender-neutral third-person pronoun. And so I just stuck with my assigned pronouns because that isn't too bad as a second-best option.

Additionally, I rarely feel any body dysphoria. The only thing that sometimes hits is when I haven't shaved in a few days and my facial hair gets visible which tanks my productivity until I get rid of it again. But apart from that, the only times where I've felt really dysphoric are when boomers talk about ""You've grown up to be such a handsome man"" or some cringe shit because *plz refer to my accomplishments or anything of substance not my fucking irrelevant  gender*

Hi. I‚Äôm a long term lurker in this group, and though I‚Äôve not posted here before (to my recollection at least), I trust y‚Äôall enough to vent my insecurities about my gender identity.

I am an AMAB non-binary person. I‚Äôm of an unfortunate group of AMABs that are built like a truck. To put it into perspective, I‚Äôm 6‚Äô3‚Äù, I wear XXLT men‚Äôs shirts, 38x32 size pants, and size 14 men‚Äôs shoes. Nothing I can do will make me look dainty or even remotely feminine, and it hurts to know that I‚Äôll never quite look how I feel. The body hair also doesn‚Äôt help. I have gotten 2 items of clothing that I feel make me look slightly feminine (a blue button up cardigan that has coloring similar to acid wash jeans, and pair of custom made converse with a floral print), but even they only do so much to help. Finding clothes my size is a nightmare as is, but finding anything feminine in my sizes is usually a joke. In the end, I feel that my appearance at beast says ‚Äúflamboyantish man.‚Äù Then there‚Äôs my mannerisms: I‚Äôm loud, I cuss a lot, I‚Äôm clumsy, and I have the tendency to never back down. Excuse me for buying into gender stereotypes in this moment, but non of that seems even remotely feminine. Between my appearance and my mannerisms, I never feel NB enough, and I feel like my appearance options consist of men‚Äôs clothing or costume drag outfits, neither of which I find appealing. It‚Äôs not that I wanna look like a girl, but how can I appear androgynous when I have nothing feminine going my way?

AFAB non-binary/genderfluid here. 30 years old, 5'7, 200lbs, out in some capacity for 5 years. I've settled into a lovely genderfluid/neutral wardrobe, my body has always been an affirming level of unladylike (big shoulders, strong jaw, big bones, etc.), and I have people around me who accept me for who I am. 

The only thing I feel dysphoria about is my DD/DDD breasts. I have a gc2b binder and the new TomboyX compression bra (10/10 highly recommend btw) but after three years binding is feeling more and more like a temporary solution. Also, my breasts destroy my posture, the bras dig in to my PTSD-tensed muscles, and my shoulders always hurt -- so even before gender reasons they have been a point of suffering.

I don't care about passing as a boy, nor do I need nipples. I'm trying to figure out whether mastectomy or ftm top surgery is the better option.

BUT - I learned in college that people who have dysphoria and get surgery (for things like breast augmentation or weight loss) aren't happy afterward because they didn't solve the root psychological issue. What if that's what I'm doing, projecting my immovable psychological issues onto this one solution?

I'm disabled and in poverty so it's not like I'm going to schedule the appointment anytime soon, but if you have had any experience with top surgery of any kind I would love to learn your perspective.

2020-06-10 18:24:24,h0gskv,1,2,"Hello everyone of you beautiful people,
I just went on a YouTube loop. Suddenly YouTube suggested me informational videos about/from genderfluid and nonbinary people. I started to watch them. 
So, I knew beforehand what nonbinary was, but never actually delved deeper, you know? And now there were those persons talking about their life and how they identify and my heart started to race and I was nearly crying (still am). Because I felt it, like I‚Äôve been there but never expressed it. 
I was born a female, when I was around the ages 8-12 I wanted to be seen as a boy and be addressed as him/he, sometimes her/she.  My mum never had a real problem with this, as I got older I grew boobs (puberty, yay) and my male friends no longer wanted to play with me. So I did what society wanted from me and just was a girl, and also had another coming out. I realised I was bi (later realised I was pan). 
So, I embraced being female, wearing tight clothes and everything. 
Three years ago, I shaved my head and it felt just right, you know? I could wear my baggier clothes (and often a sports bra) and it would happen that someone addressed me as male, I actually liked it in those moments. Sadly, I didn‚Äôt think twice about it. 
So last year I started to just wear boxy clothes as I no longer felt comfortable in all my tight shirts and stuff.

Suddenly YouTube suggested me informational videos about/from genderfluid and nonbinary people. I started to watch them. \nSo, I knew beforehand what nonbinary was, but never actually delved deeper, you know? And now there were those persons talking about their life and how they identify and my heart started to race and I was nearly crying (still am). Because I felt it, like I‚Äôve been there but never expressed it. \nI was born a female, when I was around the ages 8-12 I wanted to be seen as a boy and be addressed as him/he, sometimes her/she.  My mum never had a real problem with this, as I got older I grew boobs (puberty, yay) and my male friends no longer wanted to play with me. So I did what society wanted from me and just was a girl, and also had another coming out. I realised I was bi (later realised I was pan). \nSo, I embraced being female, wearing tight clothes and everything. \nThree years ago, I shaved my head and it felt just right, you know? I could wear my baggier clothes (and often a sports bra) and it would happen that someone addressed me as male, I actually liked it in those moments.

I'm genderfluid and use they/them pronouns. My workplace is great and let me add my pronouns in my email signature. The problem started about 2 months ago.

One of my sales people started an email with ""Good morning They/Them"". It made me uncomfortable but I brushed it off thinking it was a mistake or a one time thing. About a month later he sent me another email that said ""Hello They/Them"". It made me super uncomfortable seeing that he did it twice so I thought he might be confused so I emailed him back saying ""My name is this and my pronouns are they/them"" then I changed my signature to say They/They Pronouns in parentheses after my bolded name. 

Today however, I got another email. He said ""Hello ""They/They"""" in quotations before a very condescending email. My fiance (who is also trans) was livid every time it happened but this time convinced me to tell my supervisor. She told my office manager and now I have a conference call with the HR person.

Hopefully this doesn't offend anyone in any way, I just want to share my feelings and questions so that hopefully someone can help me understand myself a little better!

I think I might fit somewhere in the nonbinary umbrella, but I'm not sure. I'm AFAB, but have never fully felt comfortable with my assigned gender. Sometimes I don't mind presenting as more feminine, but other times I want to be seen as androgynous as possible or even more on the masculine side. My comfort with my body changes from day to day, on some days I feel confident with a ""feminine"" body and other days I wish I have more androgynous features. My main fear with identifying as nonbinary is that because I'm AFAB and more on the feminine side, no one would take me seriously. Has anyone experienced this?

I haven't experimented with expression very much outside of clothing. I usually wear unisex clothing, but sometimes I'll wear ""men's"" and ""women's"" clothing or whatever looks cute. I understand that clothes do not equal gender, but personally I feel like they matter to my self expression. My face and hair look very feminine, so people always assume I'm a girl no matter what I wear. I've never been called by they/them or he/him pronouns because of this, so I haven't been able to test them out to see if they work for me. I try to imagine how I'd feel if someone used different pronouns on me, and I think I'd be okay with any?? But I'm not sure. And I already have a gender neutral nickname, so thankfully I don't have to worry about that!

So, what do you think? I know only I can define my gender, but do these sound like the feelings and experiences of a nonbinary person? If so, I'd really appreciate help with labels! While some people reject labels, I need them to feel comfortable with myself. Otherwise, I feel like I don't know who I am and it's very frustrating!

So, hi. I feel like I may fit somewhere into the non-binary side of life, though most specifically I feel like I'm in a gender fluid category. The term demi-girl/demi-woman has made the most sense to me, but unfortunately it's not a widely known or understood term and I've had people be very critical of the classification, so I struggle to say it out loud. I'm afab and to some degree feel rooted in that, but I have full on periods of time where I feel like it doesn't fit quite right, and I get pretty notable gender dysphoria in women's spaces (but that said, I don't feel comfortable in men's spaces, I'm just not a masc person really). I feel solidarity with women, and yet, I feel like I don't fully fit the bill. Like some days it's fine, but so much of the time I feel like I'm in a woman-shaped suit and just going through the motions. I sometimes get a bit dysphoric about my body too, like I don't feel like it's womanly enough to be a real woman... but generally, I like and cherish my body. In the last year maybe, when people ask for my pronouns, I truthfully say that I mostly use she/her, but I also use they/them. I'm still MOST comfortable with she/her, but it feels strange to admit that, because I almost feel like I'm not actually gender dysphoric if I prefer those pronouns. I like they/them as well, and they do fit, they just don't fit quite as well. I don't know. I apologize if this is word vomit. I'm able to articulate so many things about myself and my life, but this has existed for as long as I can remember, longer than I even had words to describe it with, and I still fumble horribly.  


Part of me has just stomached all this for years, specifically because of the pronoun thing. When people refer to me as she/her, it's totally fine! When they call me a woman or girl or any other feminine-noun, it's also fine I guess, but these things aren't specifically 'right' so much as they're not wrong. They/them doesn't necessarily fit better, but sometimes, some days, maybe even in just some specific sentences, I need it for myself. But I feel incredible GUILT, because I'm just here passing through life as female, and it's not incorrect but it's also not the full story.  


I guess if I can boil this down, do any other enby/genderqueer/flux/fluid people still default to she pronouns? Am I just trying to classify myself as something that I'm not, and is that harmful to other non-binary people?  


I really hope I'm not off base by asking all this. I don't really have people in my life who I know how to talk to these things about.",NonBinary,[ask] I'm an older person navigating gender things.

I feel solidarity with women, and yet, I feel like I don't fully fit the bill. Like some days it's fine, but so much of the time I feel like I'm in a woman-shaped suit and just going through the motions. I sometimes get a bit dysphoric about my body too, like I don't feel like it's womanly enough to be a real woman... but generally, I like and cherish my body. In the last year maybe, when people ask for my pronouns, I truthfully say that I mostly use she/her, but I also use they/them. I'm still MOST comfortable with she/her, but it feels strange to admit that, because I almost feel like I'm not actually gender dysphoric if I prefer those pronouns. I like they/them as well, and they do fit, they just don't fit quite as well. I don't know. I apologize if this is word vomit. I'm able to articulate so many things about myself and my life, but this has existed for as long as I can remember, longer than I even had words to describe it with, and I still fumble horribly.  \n\n\nPart of me has just stomached all this for years, specifically because of the pronoun thing. When people refer to me as she/her, it's totally fine! When they call me a woman or girl or any other feminine-noun, it's also fine I guess, but these things aren't specifically 'right' so much as they're not wrong. They/them doesn't necessarily fit better, but sometimes, some days, maybe even in just some specific sentences, I need it for myself. But I feel incredible GUILT, because I'm just here passing through life as female, and it's not incorrect but it's also not the full story.  \n\n\nI guess if I can boil this down, do any other enby/genderqueer/flux/fluid people still default to she pronouns? Am I just trying to classify myself as something that I'm not, and is that harmful to other non-binary people?  \n\n\nI really hope I'm not off base by asking all this. I don't really have people in my life who I know how to talk to these things about."", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': ""[ask] I'm an older person navigating gender things. I'm not out.

So I was named after my great-grandmothers. This has been a *Thing* for my family as long as I can remember, it‚Äôs always been a Big Deal‚Ñ¢. I am going to be changing my first name to Avery, and will be hypenating my other two names and making that my middle name.

I‚Äôm 20 so I don‚Äôt need my permission from my parents, but obviously I‚Äôm going to have to tell them. I‚Äôll be telling them one at a time, (my mom and then my dad). They don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm nonbinary, I don‚Äôt mind if my mom finds out but my dad probably Should Not Know that particular detail.

I‚Äôve been vocal for as long as I can remember about hating my name, and wanting to change it. I doubt they ever actually thought I would. I know they are going to take it personally, and my mom in particular is going to be heartbroken.

Did/Does anyone else have a situation like this?

2020-06-12 21:36:01,h7to90,5,9,"Hi all! This is my first post on this sub.

So basically, a couple of days ago I realized I was nonbinary and ever since I've been trying to more precisely figure out my gender identity. I decided to post my current gender situation here for two reasons:

1. I'm hoping you people can provide some insight into my situation. (It would be insanely appreciated!)

2. I've come out privately to two friends so far and I want them to read this in a way that's more organized than a discord DM. (Edit: just sent this to a third friend, completely out of context. If you're here, I just eanito let you know that you're awesome :D)

Here goes: (I guess it would be helpful to know that I'm AMAB.)

First, there's gender roles. I googled the term and found a really helpful site that listed a few different kinds of gender roles. So far (I constantly realize new things so this might change), except for my hobbies and occupations, which are male-dominated (speedsolving twisty puzzles such as the Rubik's cube, Magic: the Gathering, math, etc.), the gender roles I relate to are pretty much a 50/50 split between masculine and feminine. Make of that what you will.

Next up, there's pronouns. Since I can't exactly test any pronouns out with anyone other than myself, that's what I've been doing so far. I'm comfortable with he/him, not comfortable with she/her, and results for they/them have so far been inconclusive.

Finally, a few general thoughts. I guess in a way the idea of gender seems a bit weird to me. After all, it's my mind, so categorizing it based on this social construct seems odd. I don't know if I 100% resent it though (I don't especially feel weird being called a boy). This leads me to my next point: I don't believe in the existence of souls, but I feel like if I had one, it would (probably) be genderless. I don't ""think like a boy"" (or ""like a girl"" for that matter). I just think.

That's about it. Like I said earlier, I'd hugely appreciate any help or insight.

I'm nonbinary. Not out yet, but trying soon.My birth name is Jamie. Neutral, right?Maybe for everybody else.

I'm AMAB, and while my name is technically James (Hate it so bad), I've gone as Jamie since birth.I like to think of Jamie as my masculine side. It's interesting to put a name on my masculine qualities (I'm about as masculine as feminine). My feminine side is named Indigo (thank you reddit for that name!). It's nice to think about it as 2 sides in me.

This means that I need a new name.

For all of my life, I've loved space, astronomy, and science fiction.

I want to pick a heavenly body as my chosen name. I know that that would make me the biggest nerd, but names aren't permanent (I would like to keep it, but...whatever. I wouldn't change my legal name, but a nickname that everyone would call me).

My current list is short, and the reason I wrote this is to help me expand it, because none of them really stick.My list:

Sol

Jupiter

Luna

Mars

Trappist

Polaris

Of course, if another name really pops out at me, I would obviously use it. The other ones I'm considering are listed below:

Alex

Alec

Theo

Not long ago, I was reading on the debate of the Autistic ""Male-Brain"" theory, and while I don't necessarily agree with the theory, the term ""Male-Brain"" struck out to me. I've had instances of feeling like a ""man"", especially when I'm with other women. I've fantasized about women. I've had thoughts of wishing I had a penis, and being a shemale but other times i'm happy being how i am.

For example, when men talk about women, I don't feel excluded because I understand their sentiments (unless they're talking about something that's inherently sexist or stereotypical). I relate to men a lot but also I relate to women a lot too. 

For years I put it to being open-minded but now I'm a bit confused as I decided to research about the topic. So here's my questions:

1) I've understood biological sex =/= gender. But what are the basis of being non-binary? Like, how does it differentiate from being trans? (I get that there are intersex that might consider themselves as non-binary, but what about others who are not intersex?) 

2) Would it offend you if you were called by your biological sex instead of your gender? I get that transpeople would prefer being called by their chosen gender, but what about non-binary? 

For example, if I was non-binary and someone called me a girl - I wouldn't mind because they can't have known if I haven't told them.

2020-06-13 15:04:14,h89648,1,2,"This is gonna be a long one. I appreciate anyone who reads all of this :)

So currently I‚Äôm 17, 18 very soon and I‚Äôve been identifying as not cis since April 2016. I was 13 at the time. At this very Moment, I identify as FTM.

So to start off the story, I grew up as a Jehovah‚Äôs Witness. Majority for my family are homophobic and transphobic so when I wanted to come out to them I knew it was gonna be tough and it was hard for me too to accept that I couldn‚Äôt be in my religion. (Now I think it‚Äôs all bullshit now anyways). So I believe this has given me some internalized transphobia.

When I was 11, I hit puberty and my parents were also planning a divorce. I got insanely depressed and suicidal and it was a very bad time for me. I began developing female characteristics and all and I was pretty uncomfortable. I felt very ugly and disgusting and I really trying to uber-feminize myself. I could never find anything to wear. I remember being in middle school and having a break down because all my clothes made me feel gross. I had to wear makeup all the time to feel like a good looking person but I never felt okay. I was always uncomfortable and my insecurity made me much more suicidal then the divorce. I wasn‚Äôt a tom boy growing up. I had girl toys and clothes and it didn‚Äôt bother me ever until puberty hit and I felt repulsive to myself. 

Coincidentally, my 2 best friends in middle school 8th grade came out as trans FTMs. One of them now is on T and the other has detransitioned back to female. When they came out, it gave me a spark that this could be me. This could by why I was struggling with myself so much. Maybe I had gender dysphoria. After lots of research and digging, I came out as agender on March 2016. I started using they/them pronouns ,cut my hair, changed my name , and dressed androgynous. And In all honesty it was better. I started to improve slightly. But after a few months I felt like there was more. I wanted to be more masculine. So I came out as Bigender and a gender flux. I was 13 and didn‚Äôt know anything. June 2016, I came out as demiboy because I couldn‚Äôt imagine myself as a manly man but it eventually slowly turned into FTM. I changed my pronouns to he/him and changed my name to a masculine one. I got a binder and dressed masculine and i have to say that since then it has been easier on my depression. I have had constant battles of dysphoria and doubt. At the time tho, I was hanging out with a lot of boys and it felt amazing. They all accepted me and made me feel like one of them and I was very happy. 

February 2017, I began dating a straight boy. Why? Because I was stupid and wanted someone to love me because both my parents were not accepting and it made me feel awful. It was a very toxic relationship and I ended up going back in the closet. And my life was hell. I hated being misgendered all the time again and dressing more feminine so he would like me. But I was 14 and didn‚Äôt know what I was doing. It went on for 10 freaking months. I would cry when he wanted me to be his wife because I didn‚Äôt want to be his wife or A WIFE. I finally broke it off because I found a dude who liked me (I moved to a new school and I found him there) He was bi and very kind to me and I knew I would feel more comfortable.

I went to my new school as FTM but I didn‚Äôt know how to dress very masculine. It consisted of hoodies and skinny jeans left over from my emo phase. I still got misgendered a lot but the staff was really supportive. To asses my doubt, I did a little bit of feminine dressing but it made me just want to die. I continued to go through doubt and dysphoria that made me feel like I was in hell. And after 6 months, my bf came out to me as straight and I broke it off right away. 

Fast forward to today, I have been dating a straight girl for almost 2 years. She has been super supportive of me being trans but my doubt creeps in. 

So finally to get to the doubt, one of the biggest issues in my life. I have never had a lot of self confidence since puberty. After I came out as trans I really did see improvement. I often ask myself if this is really me or if I have enough dysphoria or if I can really see myself as a man but when I try to experiment I feel disgusting and gross. Some days I do feel very confident I‚Äôm myself as FTM and other days I do not. I recently talked to my therapist about wanting T and she doesn‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ready and that‚Äôs been weighing on me ALOT. T is something I‚Äôve been waiting for and I really want top surgery. So it killed me when she wouldn‚Äôt put me on T. But I probably am not ready. I‚Äôve been experimenting with he/they lately but I haven‚Äôt told a lot of
People for me to hear it out loud. T does sound great at times. I wish I had more build, a deeper T, and a different facial structure (I don‚Äôt pass very often) and bottom growth sounds great honestly but then when I really think about I get worried that it‚Äôs wrong for me and that I‚Äôll want to detransition. I gets lots of anxiety from my doubt and sometimes break downs. I have a lot of pressure on me since my gf is straight. She said she doesn‚Äôt mind me experimenting with feminine stuff but even when I want to it makes me uncomfortable. I wonder a lot what would have happened if my best friends didn‚Äôt come out as trans. I really don‚Äôt think I am cis. I clearly have some dysphoria and I don‚Äôt think a cis person obsesses with their gender that much. I can‚Äôt imagine myself in long hair, showing curves off. Just the thought makes me uncomfortable. Sometimes I just wanna be more feminine and I don‚Äôt like it. It‚Äôs hard for me to distinguish my identity from expression. Clearly I have self esteem issues. And I‚Äôm just over all tired of the doubt for the past 4 years. I obsess over my gender constantly and it‚Äôs so unhealthy. I‚Äôm not severely depressed anymore but this shit is hard to live with. 

I have trans friends who are very confident in themselves and that makes me really nervous because I‚Äôm not that way. 

When it comes to my body, most days I am able to look in the mirror naked and not feel too uncomfortable but I do see a disconnect. It took me a long time to be able to be fully naked in front of my gf. (Another thing to mention, having sex with my past boyfriends made me SUPER dysphoric after). But when we do stuff together I always wish I had a dick and I imagine myself with one. And it makes me feel better. I cried one time because she made me feel so masc and euphoric. Anyways, with my chest, I really would like top surgery, but I am able To be shirtless by myself or with my gf. I can‚Äôt stand not wearing a binder In public tho. I get dysphoric over a lot. My feet and hand size, my hair, my eyebrows, face structure, voice, etc. some days it‚Äôs really strong and other days not. It‚Äôs the not days that give me doubt. 

I‚Äôve been thinking of taking a low dose of T or so to really see if T is for me. And I can stop it soon enough if I don‚Äôt like it and then reanalyze myself. But damn this has been hella long and I really appreciate who ever reads my life story üòÇ. Hopefully everything makes sense and I‚Äôll make edits if needed.

If I had to choose to identify as a boy or a girl I would definitely rather call myself a boy. At the same time I still primarily identify as non-binary, and I prefer they/them pronouns. I also opt to use masculine terms to describe myself (dude, bro, boy, brother, etc.) 

The thing is, though, since I‚Äôm non-binary, my appearance doesn‚Äôt really match my cognition in terms of masculinity. In my brain, I already see myself and my body as masculine the way they are. In practice, people misgender me a lot, and I kind of wonder if it‚Äôs my fault. My friends have described my fashion as androgynous. 

Sometimes I feel pressured to change my appearance to try and ‚Äúpass‚Äù as more masculine or androgynous, and I blame myself for not looking masculine enough when I get misgendered. At the same time, I don‚Äôt think ‚Äúpassing‚Äù is something I actually ~want~ to do. After all, cognitively, I already see myself as masculine even if I look visibly AFAB to others (?).

I guess my question is, do I have to look more masculine/ make more of an effort to ‚Äúpass‚Äù to be valid as a transmasc enby? Or is it fine for me to cognitively see myself as masculine but present as androgynous/ even slightly femme? Also, how masculine would I have to look to justify using he/him pronouns?

I am nonbinary trans-masc and interested in starting HRT. I have a therapist who is helping me find providers who are experienced in HRT and trans health. My question is:

What are some questions that i should ask providers to make sure my HRT experience aligns with my nonbinary identity?

Some questions I have already thought of that might be the most obvious, but i am curious if you all have further ideas or maybe advice from your own experience (whether masc or fem)

- have you treated nonbinary patients before? Have you treated nonbinary patients specifically with HRT?

- do you feel informed about microdosing in HRT?

- what options do you have for nonbinary people who do not fit into a strictly binary transition process?

Any other ideas would be great appreciated!

2020-06-13 16:43:00,h8awlj,2,3,"Hi everyone, long post incoming. I'm posting this from a new account because there will be a lot of identifying information here. I'm not sure if this is more of an advice-seeking post or a rant post...I guess we'll see once I've typed it out.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been out as nonbinary since 2016. I started my social transition immediately, I legally changed my name in 2017, I had top surgery in 2018, and I started low dose testosterone 4 months after that. In my daily life, I can be pretty male-passing when I try, though not 100% - I kind of look like a teen boy. I have no desire to be completely male-passing, either; I prefer to look androgynous. I just moved to a new state and started a new job, and no one here knows I'm trans.

&amp;#x200B;

The state I just moved to (Arkansas) technically allows X gender markers on drivers' licenses, which I was really excited about at first, but now that I'm here, I don't know if it's a good idea. I've lived in the South my whole life, but since I left my small hometown for college before I came out, I never experienced being trans in a rural area - I've only ever been out in a college town, which, while still conservative, had a sizable trans community. I'm really in the heart of Trump country now, confederate flags and MAGA signs everywhere, and I think having an X would be too big of a risk. Not to mention, I wouldn't be able to put it on any of my other legal documents like my passport, so it would likely create problems down the road in that department.

&amp;#x200B;

I would be okay leaving my marker as an F, but at my new job, everyone thinks I'm a cis guy. I didn't mean to go stealth, it just kind of happened because I never corrected anyone, and I'm not really too keen on coming out. I prefer being treated as a guy versus being treated as a girl when those are the only two options, at least. (At my last job, I wasn't out and presented as a woman, and I hated it.) For the sake of safety and not being outed, I'm considering changing my gender marker to M. I spend a good portion of my days working way out in the forest with my small group of coworkers, all cis guys as far as I know, so if I'm outed and any of them end up having a problem with me, I worry it could end badly. I don't think it's terribly likely that it would come to that, but it's still a thought in the back of my mind. I'm not willing to leave this job, either; I love what I'm doing, and I've worked so hard to get here.

&amp;#x200B;

I know changing my gender maker to an M is probably the safest and most reasonable thing for me to do, and I probably will do it. Leaving it as an F means it's probably only a matter of time before I get outed. It just hurts so much to have put so much work into transitioning into my true self, only to have to go into hiding on the other side of the binary I tried so hard to escape. I'm not a man any more than I am a woman, and it's causing me a lot of turmoil to know that I have to make a choice between the two in order to be safe.

I‚Äôm 30 AFAB. I‚Äôm slowly accepting that I‚Äôm non binary, but it‚Äôs been hard for me. Not sure if it‚Äôs because I feel ‚Äútoo old‚Äù to be exploring this, or if it‚Äôs due to my conservative family being transphobic, or because I‚Äôm in a relationship with a guy who is cis and straight. But the longer I sit with it the more I realize non binary suits me.

I‚Äôm in this weird place where I‚Äôve accepted it, but sometimes try to convince myself I‚Äôm cis. Today I decided to try some makeup out to see how it felt. I was feeling good (I ran my 5k for the first time ever today so I was feeling myself!) and thought it would be a good time to experiment. I was never super femme, but I would wear makeup sometimes.

Y‚ÄôALL - I HATED THE WAY I LOOKED. It was that feeling of not recognizing yourself. I thought I would like it but I didn‚Äôt. Even though I felt weird, it sort of affirmed things for me a bit.

Note: I am fully supportive of wearing makeup of course if that‚Äôs what works for you!!!! I just found it to be e helpful experiment for me to realiZe that I am indeed following the right path. Just thought I‚Äôd share in case someone else might feel similarly.

Pretty means that you‚Äôre beautiful in a delicate way much like a flower is pretty.

Beautiful is much the same as pretty as it does not necessarily mean that someone is calling you female as beautiful means that you‚Äôre aesthetically pleasing.

While pretty and beautiful are generally seen as more feminine compliments, just because you are pretty like a delicate flower, or beautiful like a waterfall, does not mean when someone calls you such that they are denying your identity, these words are much along the lines of cute or attractive and should be taken in and embraced as compliments rather than as insults.",NonBinary,Pretty/beautiful,1592178606.0,"{'created_utc': 1592153406, 'id': 'h8x89q', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 2, 'selftext': 'I‚Äôm not sure if anyone needs to hear this or anything like that but just because someone says you are, or something about you, is pretty doesn‚Äôt mean necessarily they are saying you‚Äôre female.

2020-06-14 17:03:41,h8xgj3,3,6,"Hey all! So it's been quite the weekend for me. On Friday I finally came out officially as Non-Binary and yesterday I picked my new name (Ashe). It's been quite the ride, and honestly I've never felt better about my transition and future then I do now.


I've been living as a trans woman for the last 3 years, and it's been a struggle to say the least. When I first came out as trans I was still very focused on the binary. I knew I wasn't a man, so to me that meant I must be a woman. So I started the process of transitioning. After time though things didn't feel quite right. I just didn't feel like I identified as being a women either. I suppressed those thoughts for years, hoping that they would go away as I furthered my transition. But they never did. In a sense I was dealing with dysphoria all over again, but now from the other side. It was really hard. I ended up gaining a bunch of weight and became an alcoholic. I was super close to killing myself.


Everything changed about a month ago. I finally stopped drinking and I was able to focus on these feelings I've had for years. I'm not a man, but I'm also not a woman. I just am. And I'm ok with that now. For the first time in years I'm excited about my future. I feel like I can finally reach goals that are what I want, not what society demands of me. The feeling is super liberating. And despite all the terribleness in the world right now, I feel better than ever.

I have a hard time figuring out how I feel, but I know I'm definitely on the nonbinary spectrum.

2020-06-14 22:19:20,h932a7,4,2,"It's been two months (and one day) since my last T shot. I wanted to post here with some updates and observations, and also some questions, in case anyone else is thinking about going on T, stopping T, low dose T, etc.

***Some background***

* I was taking a low dose of .2ml (200mg/ml bottle) at the time I stopped. I started taking T in May 2018 at .25ml. My doctor pressured me to take .5ml so I did for a month or so, until I realized that was way too much for me and my levels were actually too high as well. I switched doctors after that and in the process, I was without T for a few months in summer 2019 until October 2019. I started T again in October at .25ml and eventually went down to .15ml and then up to .2ml, which is where I was when I stopped.
* The primary reasons for stopping T were not wanting more facial hair and not wanting any more hairline changes. I've never wanted to pass as male.
* I've had a lot of issues with chronic headaches (pretty much every day)  before going on T that going on T helped a lot. I still got headaches, but not as often as when I wasn't on T.
* Before T, my body type was small but curvy - very feminine.  I've always had a pretty masculine  face structure but it's been covered up by feminine fat distribution. Naturally I have very large cheeks and no jawline whatsoever when not on T,  and my voice was pretty high. These were some of my biggest reasons for going on T.
* I've always struggled with anxiety and depression and still struggled with both on T, but on T things seemed more high energy, anxiety-dominant and off T things seem more low energy anxiety-dominant with more depression.

***Observations***

* **4/28/20 - 5/5/20:** headaches, exhaustion, anxiety, lowered energy, weakness, fatigue. More dissosciative than normal. I was bloated and noticed tender and enlarged breasts. I thought I already noticed some fat redistribution towards my thighs and hips.
* **5/6/20:** period returned. Cramps, fatigue, bloating.
* **5/13/20:** Felt okay. Mind a little less chaotic feeling, less high-energy feeling. Noticed some fat depositing around jaw and upper thighs, which I'm pretty uncomfortable with. 
* **6/8/20:** Second period since being off T ended. I noted feeling like my jawline is seeing the most drastic change back to its previous fat distribution, which is a huge bummer for me. Feeling pretty dysphoric and have had even less sex drive than normal (even on T my sex drive was pretty low because of my mental illness). Been feeling really depressed and super fatigued. Not feeling very clearheaded and feeling very dissosciative, lots of headaches.
* **Today, 6/14/20:** I've had a headache every day since my period ended. I think some of them have been sinus headaches but allergy medicine hasn't really helped, not has ibuprofen, which usually does for me if it's sinus. Neck feels tense and I've still been feeling really lethargic. I think I might be anemic again, when I wasn't on T before I was constantly anemic, presumably due to blood loss during menstruation. Still been feeling really depressed. I feel bad because I want to exercise and know it would help, but it's really hard to muster up the energy. I can feel myself getting weaker. I notice my muscles disappearing and my cheeks getting bigger, noticing my jawline continue to disappear. Emotionally, I'm still going through a lot of the same issues with anxiety, but they just manifest a little differently now. My hips and upper legs are getting bigger as my arm muscles disappear and I feel like I look 'unbalanced'. My hair has gone back to its original texture which is very fine and straight - on T it was more wavy and a bit thicker. My hairline is actually growing bak some where it went back before, which I like.

***Personal takeaways***

* I'm still feeling frustrated. On one hand, I felt a lot better when I was on T. However, the idea of 'passing' as male with facial hair and a more masculine hairline is terrifying to me. I felt more 'me' on T but I don't know if I can handle more facial hair - it makes me super dysphoric. I'd be fine with just  a mustache but you can't really pick and choose and I know that. 
* I feel like I might like being off T better mentally and in not having to worry about becoming too 'masculine', but physically, I feel so much worse off T. Menstruation makes me super dysphoric and anemic, and I have significantly more headaches off T. 
* I'm still not sure of my next steps. I've considered going back on T and taking it with finasteride but I think I might want to wait a little longer to see how things go off T first.
* Being non-binary and transitioning is super hard. Neither hormone is a perfect fit for me and both end up making me feel more dysphoric in some ways. Trying to weigh the pros and cons of each is exhausting me.

***Questions***

* has anyone else stopped and started T here before? How did you weigh through the pros and cons and figure out what's right for you? I feel like I'm driving myself crazy trying to figure out what I need and what's best. It's extremely draining and frustrating.

Another thing that‚Äôs making it rlly difficult to understand my gender is the fact that I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôm probably a type of multigender (pangender sounds kinda nice) and I‚Äôd say one of my genders is definitely female or a feminine gender.

This along with the fact that we don‚Äôt even understand exactly what gender identity is or why ppl have the ones they do, is just rlly confusing me and making it rlly hard to explore my identity.

2020-06-15 09:51:15,h9d617,2,1,"A little over a year ago I came out as a lesbian. It was unexpected for me, I denied my queerness so much my whole life honestly because of trauma and homophobia. But once I did I finally felt hopeful about life, I felt safe/satisfied during sex, and more comfortable with my gender. I started to have more of a relationship with my gender and body and my self esteem started to get higher. As I start to like my gender any more, I start to feel less and less like a cis woman. But I'm really confused and scared and don't know who to talk to about this. It makes me tear up to think about. 

I have a lot of amazing NB friends that I love and that helped me come to terms with my sexuality. The intersectional queer/trans people in my life amaze me all the time and I have so much to thank them for. 

When I started to explore the identity lesbian I struggled with similar feelings of ""am I faking it?"" and ""aren't I too straight to be gay?"" and even ""am I just doing it for attention?"". And now I feel the same anxieties. ""Am I too cis to be trans?"" and ""Am I just trying to be like my friends"". 

I feel affirmed by the term girl or lady, but then the words woman makes me feel weird and I don't know if I feel like a woman. Yet everyone sees me as a woman. I also feel this weird pressure that if I want to be NB I have to change myself. I like who I am. I know all these thoughts aren't real or true they're just what is going through my head. 

I'm scared that if I ever came out, no one would see me as anything but a woman. And if I just accept that I won't have to deal with the pain of rejection and having everyone misunderstand me. 

It's also really hard because of all the BLM stuff going on. As the only black person in an all white family, I'm very used to being othered. I've so long dealt with micro racism from my family and all the people I am around all the time. I'm so used to having to either constantly educate and have conversations with people, or having to just listen to them be racist all the time. It's so hard for me now. And I feel that if I came out as NB I would be dealing with the exact same thing over again. I don't know if I can go through that with my family again because I'm still healing from all the racism from them in childhood. If I had to go through it twice I feel like I would lose so many people in my life. My mom has never used my trans friends pronouns no matter how I stress it's important to me that she does. Even the woman I have been interested in has said things that show me she has not done any research into transphobia. And it hurts me so much! How could I ever come out to these people? But still I'm scared to lose them, and I'm like is it worth it?

2020-06-15 12:01:10,h9ey4g,0,1,"I'm 31, AFAB, and have been using non-binary to discribe myself for about a year and a half. I've never had a conversation with anyone else who was NB before. I have no doubt that I am NB, but I want to get to know others better to see how many of my experiences are common, and how many aren't.

When I was younger I rejected all things feminine, as a rebellion against sexism I‚Äôd faced and because I didn‚Äôt feel the stereotypes associated with women represented me at all, I internalised a lot of misogyny. I disbelieved women‚Äôs experiences, because I was told I was a woman and, if what I was told I was was all bullshit, then everyone else must just be pretending.

Over the last 15 or so years I‚Äôve slowly learned to accept that feminine traits are not bad, it‚Äôs just not me. Or a least a lot of it isn‚Äôt me; I‚Äôve also accepted the parts of me that do fit the stereotypes. And I learned that women exist: and they‚Äôre great in so many under appreciated ways.

I‚Äôd heard vaguely about non-binary people for a few years, but hadn‚Äôt really thought about or recognised myself in it until the lead up to my wedding about a year ago.

But first some background, when I was a teen I would occasionally wear makeup; until there was a picture of me from my sixth form prom, with my hair straightened, and lots of makeup on. The picture looked nothing like me and I hated it! But everyone commented on how good I looked! I looked at it like; yeah that's a conveniently attractive woman in this picture I guess, but that's not me, and how can you as my friend/family look at that and say its a good picture of me?! I decided not to wear makeup again after that.

So then jump ahead 9 years and I‚Äôm engaged and my mum wants to pay for me and her to get our hair and makeup done before the wedding. I try to make a joke about the fact that I don‚Äôt have any hair (well a short back and sides lol) and try to fob her off. But she won‚Äôt have it; the conversation keeps coming up and she wants me to book someone to come to do it, and keeps nagging me even though I‚Äôm clearly not enthusiastic about it. I know it‚Äôs because she‚Äôs actually nervous about how she looks, she wants it to be a bonding thing and I feel guilty for trying to push her away.

I almost did book it, but I kept thinking of that picture from when I was younger. Thinking about an album of wedding photos where my husband is standing next to some woman I don‚Äôt recognise. I was so frustrated that this was something I had to spend my time worrying about, where as my husband‚Äôs face was apparently fine the way it was. He had his own battles though of course; he wanted to wear nail varnish on the day, but didn‚Äôt find the courage in the end.

That was what started me looking into what non-binary meant and it quickly became obvious that the term described my experiences. I outright told my mum that I didn‚Äôt want to get the makeup and she said it was ok. My wedding was amazing, I wore a leather jacket and boots with my dress, and I love how I look in the pictures. 

I‚Äôm still growing as an enby. At first I thought it was enough for me and my husband to know, and that has been empowering for me and my sense of self. Over time I‚Äôve told some people, but haven‚Äôt got around to it with others. At first I thought I wanted to keep she/her pronouns, but I think that‚Äôs just shyness and laziness, I think I want to start telling people to refer to me as they/them.

2020-06-15 22:23:55,h9qb22,4,1,"Hey, I'm not exactly sure what I'm asking, but basically I'm post-top surgery and I like wearing a packer, but because I still get gendered as female, I'm nervous to wear my packer in public or wear certain shirts. Like, at the gym, I would still wear a sports bra because my bro tanks would show my nips when I did planks. 

I guess I'm worried that because people assume I'm a girl (I'm not, I'm nonbinary and think of myself more as a guy with a good fashion sense), it'll be inappropriate if my packer shows a bit (which it does because I wear tight shorts/pants) or if my nipples show.

I've spent most days stressed and crying and agonizing over this whole change. Especially because it doesn't feel like I'm changing a lot since my appearance has always tended towards tomboy/simple and the only reason I've had more feminine necklines the past couple years is because of breastfeeding kids.

2020-06-17 02:35:43,haiccf,1,1,"Hi, this is my first post on this sub and I'm pretty nervous cuz this whole board is just gorgeous people being so gorgeous it's intimidating! &lt;3 Anyways I figured out I'm nonbinary early this year, but have still been struggling a lot with understanding myself. I'm amab, but have never really fit into traditional expectations of masculinity. I wasn't one of those kids who was obviously gay or trans, I still participated in a lot of boyish activities, watched boy shows, played with boy toys, etc. I just never really fit in as a Man. That's not to say I'm not confident, and I've been quite popular at different times in my life. So reading up on nonbinary genders in classes and online helped me understand myself and be able to put a name to my experience. I had spent several years from the ages of about 18-24 asking myself every few months ""am i a trans woman?"" but I could always tell that didn't feel quite right. Although I had enjoyed an ex referring to me as her gf and using she/her pronouns, meeting trans women irl made it clear to me that we were not the same. Not to say I thought I was above them or anything, I just didn't feel that we were cut from the same cloth, so to speak. So, now I'm proudly and comfortably nonbinary, and I use he/they pronouns. One of the few things I really like about my male biology or whatever is my facial hair, and while I continue to sport a lustrous beard &amp; mustache, most people will refer to me as a man, so continuing to use he/him is more of a survival technique than anything, cuz otherwise I'd be getting misgendered 50 times a day and that's obviously no good. 

So that's a lot of background info, but now comes to my remaining confusion and my call for help. I am really confused about the line between gender and sexuality. I know what the difference between the two concepts is, but the line is a little blurred for me in 2 ways. 1, I'm sexually submissive, something that is considered to be more typical of women. That breaking of stereotypes is part of the excitement, but also makes me feel weird, because isn't that just enforcing the binary in a different way? It should be noted that I'm turned on by dominant women, but don't think I would feel the same with another man. I've been calling myself pansexual for a while but the truth is im incredibly bicurious, never having gone past first base with a man, I just know I swoon when I look at certain men.

The 2nd weird thing to me is that I have enjoyed wearing women's clothing since middle school. It started out as a purely sexual thing, trying on women's underwear and getting immensely turned on, but in my later teen years i discovered skirts and dresses and crop tops, and now those are my favorite things to wear casually, like they just feel so affirming and freeing! And that element is absolutely nonsexual, and this is where the confusion arises. Contrapoints' video on autogynephilia really struck a nerve in me, and during my first viewing I had to take several breaks to cry and process. A lot of what Natalie talked about sounded really similar to how I've felt inside. I know that the concept has been debunked as a source of transgenderism, but I definitely am turned on at thinking of myself in the form or role of a woman. I question myself on this a lot, because the womanly ways I desire to be, are a projection of this very idealized version of womanhood, and of course I am thinking of the pretty parts I fantasize about, and not the reality of being a woman, which is much harsher than I could ever know. 

I think deep down, what I want is to be allowed to be vulnerable. So much of masculinity doctrine states that to be emotional is to be vulnerable, and to be vulnerable is to be weak. I have found a lot of solace in the work of Dr. Bren√© Brown, who talks about, among other things, the strength and courage it takes to be vulnerable. I have been able to break down the walls of toxic masculinity quite a bit, but there are certain things that are so private that I can't share with even my closest friends and family. Some things because they are my sexual secrets that only trusted partners should know, and some because most of my friends/family are cis and straight and just can't understand. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. If anyone has had similar experiences, I would really really appreciate if you share as much as you are comfortable with, in the hopes that it will help me understand myself.

I always felt like I wasn‚Äôt truly a boy or girl, but I knew that my physical body was Male and that I ‚Äúhad‚Äù to be a boy. So from the time I was in 4th grade until December of 2019, I told myself that I couldn‚Äôt be a girl. I was a boy, a man and I had to do guy things. It wasn‚Äôt until I met my girlfriend that things started to change. My girlfriend is pretty tomboyish and for the most part, way more masculine than I am. When we started dating she accepted that I wasn‚Äôt the most masculine guy in the world and accepted that I am more feminine. She accepted me when I told her I wanted to wear more female clothing and accepts me for who I am. It changed something in me. I was no longer afraid of the thoughts I‚Äôve had my entire life, that I didn‚Äôt feel like a guy or a girl. I stopped letting that fear dictate how I feel and act around her or my friends. I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about these things since we started dating in December 2019 and I finally understand what I‚Äôve been feeling and who I am. 

Today, I sat with my girlfriend and confessed all of these feelings to her. All of my anxiety and worries of her not accepting me or being afraid to be with me because I feel like both a man and a girl. That I don‚Äôt care what I am identified as, if it‚Äôs he/him or she/her. That I want to wear girl clothing just as much as I do guy clothing. That I hate my body hair and wish my skin was smooth. That some days I wish that I wasn‚Äôt a stuck in a man‚Äôs body. But that there are days where I want to go and play sports or video games with my guy friends. That I want to feel like a man and feel masculine. That I am confused and I don‚Äôt know what to feel or who I am or what I am. My girlfriend smiled at me and pulled me into a hug and told me that she loves me because of these things. That I am me and that she will continue love me regardless of what I am.

Yesterday night, I was talking to my mom privately. We had a really long conversation. She couldn't understand what Nonbinary meant exactly, doesn't understand dysphoria at all, says that she won't be able to use my pronouns.

Let's break that down:

1. Nonbinary is not very hard to understand. I'm not male, and I'm not female. Similar to Intersex, but you weren't born in that category.
2. I don't know how to explain dysphoria. I tried to explain dysphoria about pants like this ""imagine that your pants were the ugliest design ever, and you couldn't take them off. They are also a little too cold and make you really uncomfortable"". I know that this wasn't the best explanation, but I couldn't find the words.
3. I don't really understand why it's so hard to say ""He"" outside and ""They"" or ""She"" in the house? I don't get it.
4. She doesn't understand how serious I am about my identity. I KNOW FOR A FACT that I'm nonbinary. 99.999999999%. But she still thinks that I'll grow out of it, and that it's a faze. She thinks that it is unlikely that I will remain nonbinary. I will. I think that she thinks that I came to her because I was confused. No. This is the billionth step. I told you because i don't have access to clothes that reduce dysphoria, and I'm not able to choose my own haircut (I have the choice of short and really short). 

The weird part is that she is super liberal and accepting. This really was a big shock to me. Her boyfriend, who is also super accepting, understood a little more (I told him too, he's like a second father to me). He didn't understand the severity of dysphoria. It's bad. He tried to imagine it as something like being uncomfortable with your body during awkward growth stages. No! It is so much worse.

2020-06-18 02:51:56,hb67hr,0,1,"Hi
I'm afab non-binary or at least I'm pretty sure I am non-binary. 

I went off of the contraceptive pill a few months ago after realising that it was causing reflux which I also had been medicating. This was after being on the pill since my early teens. 

A little less than a year prior to this I had come to the conclusion that I am non-binary so this isn't a new revelation.

A couple of months ago my impulsive adhd brain decided to tell my parents about me being non-binary when a related topic came up and while they have somewhat come around since then, that didn't go the best. One of them also threw me into confusion and questioning myself by asking how it is different to me just accepting myself and how I know I'm non-binary and commenting that it is directionless and has no goal, which I couldn't really answer since it is a very internal thing that can't be explained properly. 

This threw me into a barely functioning depressed state for some time which I am mostly out of now due to working it out with them a bit but I don't think I'm out of it completely. My partner both helped with this in some ways and caused me new concerns in other ways. 

I reached a point afterwards where I felt dysphoric enough that I felt I had to do something and I shaved my head.

Off the pill I'm happier in general and feel healthier in general but I'm more dysphoric than before but while I strongly believe I'm non-binary and am not really questioning that, I don't know if the extra dysphoria is my hormones being wacky from adjusting to being off the pill after being on it for about a decade and a half, my hormones being my actual hormones and reflecting what would have actually happened earlier if I didn't suppress my hormones by chucking more on top with the pill, or if the dysphoria is remaining from being triggered by earlier interactions with my parents and with my partner or if I'm simply getting more dysphoria because I'm getting more dysphoria. I also have sensory issues which confuses things more and makes it harder to distinguish why I feel certain ways not when it comes to being non-binary but when it comes to specific areas that cause body dysphoria. I also have a history of depression and anxiety which doesn't help in working everything out either. And I am also at increased risk of pcos which probably confuses things even more. 

Has anyone been on the contraceptive pill and gone off it and noticed a change in terms of dysphoria? If so, what? 

Also has anyone else here dealt with sensory issues that occurred in relation to a part of your body that caused you dysphoria? How did you work out the difference?

Should I wait longer for my hormones to normalise after going off the pill before seeking any help for gender dysphoria?

What can I expect from trying to seek help working through gender dysphoria? I'm in Australia if anyone has info on the process for Australia specifically.

I have adhd and I'm also in the process of working with professionals to determine if I am autistic after my psychiatrist who treats my adhd said he believes I possibly am (but he can't do the assessment) after I went through burnout in a job.
Should I wait until I get the autism side of stuff worked out before seeking help for this? Will they have any major impact on each other? There does appear to be some overlap between neurodiversity and gender differences but idk how much treatment for one affects or informs the other.

I (afab) went off of the pill a few months ago and I overall feel happier and healthier off the pill but I think I have more dysphoria off the pill.  It is hard to work this out though as discussions with family have also undoubtedly contributed to having more dysphoria.  

Even if going off the pill is contributing I don't know if that is because my hormones are out of wack from adjusting to being off the pill or if it is because my normal hormones were suppressed by the pill and going off the pill just shows what would have been the case if I hadn't suppressed how my hormones normally are but putting female hormones on top of it.

2020-06-18 03:57:44,hb75lx,5,1,"Hello all! 

After doing a bit of deep thinking and research into gender terms, I‚Äôve realized that I fall on the non-binary spectrum. I specifically identify as libramasculine, but say non-binary most of the time because it‚Äôs just a bit easier to explain to people. I‚Äôm slowly starting to transition to they/them pronouns with those that I am close with and trust. But it‚Äôs a bit intimidating to announce and I‚Äôm kinda taking it step by step.

One of the steps I‚Äôve started to take is in my appearance. For example, I just got some new glasses that I feel make me look much more gender neutral, have started shaving my legs (which sucks by the way), and have been growing my hair out longer than it‚Äôs ever been. However, when it comes to clothes, I‚Äôve had a bit of a hard time.

I‚Äôm biologically male. And I‚Äôd like to start shifting towards a larger variety of both feminine and gender neutral clothing. However, I‚Äôm having trouble finding any that match my body type. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô 2‚Äù, my arms are a bit more muscular and my collar bones are relatively defined, which makes a lot women‚Äôs clothing not too flattering on me in my opinion and/or not in my size.

On top of that, I still am not 100% confident about being out and the open with my gender identity yet. The few more feminine pieces I do have rarely get worn because a lot of the time I‚Äôm a bit worried that I‚Äôll be started at or judged. This carries over to shopping for women‚Äôs clothing in the first place. I feel like all eyes are on me when I‚Äôm looking through the women‚Äôs section. I feel genuinely sexy and cute when I wear feminine clothes but worry others will judge me. 

So I guess, I‚Äôm wondering if anyone has any advice on ways to dress more gender neutral despite many physical characteristics of biological sex, what it‚Äôs like to be in public in a gender neutral outfit, and tips on starting to transition from a strictly male wardrobe to a much more varied one.

Really, any advice you could give on fashion and appearance would be very appreciated.\n\nThank you all ‚ù§Ô∏è', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'New to my gender identity; questions about fashion.', 'created': 1592477864.0}"

If so, this is your chance to tell me: What is school like for YOU? Is it good, bad or just ok? Is there anything that could make it better?

I want to hear all about it!

We already know a bit about how lesbian, gay and bisexual people experience school, but we don‚Äôt really know what school is like for those who identify as transgender or non-binary. I need your help to understand what school is like for transgender and non-binary students and whether there is anything that could be done to make school a better place. This comes at a time when many transgender and non-binary young people are going through particularly tough times in school and other areas of life. In doing this research whereby I will contact both transgender individuals and teachers, I hope to come up with some ways which could make school more inclusive and representative.

If you are interested in taking part in an interview, or if you want more information or have any questions about this then please contact me by email.

To take part you must:

¬∑ Identify as transgender or non-binary or have experienced gender transition in some way ‚Äì this can be during ***or after*** your time at secondary school (it isn‚Äôt a requirement that you were transgender or non-binary at secondary school to take part)

¬∑ Spent at least some time in secondary school in the UK

2020-06-18 20:46:50,hbmnu5,2,1,"Hi! I'm 15 years old, AFAB and I think I might be non binary? I thought for a couple years that I might be ftm, but me and my friend were talking and I realized recently that nb might be for me. I have a couple questions that I don't really know who to go to to get answers to, so I figured that here would be the best place :)

1 - Am I too young to know my gender identity yet? When I was 13 I was so sure I was ftm, but now I'm not so sure. I don't to feel like that again, where I think I know something for sure but then everything changes again - how probable is it that this is just a phase and I'll grow out of it?

2 - Does a lack of severe dysphoria mean you aren't trans? Some days I think I'm okay with my female biology, but I have this obsession with facial hair and having a flat chest - I would love to look more masculine but I don't know if that means I'm trans?? I know that I'm not comfortable being referred to as a female, but sometimes I'm okay with my female biology. Does this discontinuity mean I may not be eligible for testosterone if I wanted to possibly get hormone therapy?

3 - With my experience of the LGBTQ+ community so far, most of the people are lovely, understanding and always happy to help, however a small portion are not. If I were to identify as transgender but not get surgery/hormone therapy, would people think less of me? Would I be seen as 'not trans enough'? Would people gatekeep the community?

4 - My birth name is Jessica, though I dislike how gendered it is. I'm currently closeted, but I have a friend who will get me experiment with names/pronouns with her so I'd like to think about having a new name. I went by Josh for a while, but it's not something I really want to go by at the moment, it's more of a last resort. My parents said I could have been called Jack if I was a boy, so I guess that's something? Any masculine or androgynous names would be appreciated!

5 - I would really like to experiment with cutting my hair/binding etc, however I don't really know where to start. I can't think of any way to get a binder just yet as I don't have a debit card and I'm not out to my parents yet, so that might be out of the question. If there are any safe homemade ways to bind, I would really appreciate if if you let me know! I know some methods can be dangerous, so I tend to be wary about binding at home.

2020-06-19 01:31:48,hbrgqn,10,1,"quick disclaimer: I am autistic, lesbian, and I have PCOS

Hi everyone, I‚Äôm a 20 something person AFAB and I have always felt somewhat detached from my gender. I‚Äôm gonna try keep it simple but here is how I would explain my current feelings in regards to gender.

- growing up I‚Äôve always been androgynous in my clothes, my attitude, and I was interested in stereotypically girls things and stereotypically boys things.

- due to PCOS I didn‚Äôt have periods and had to take medication at 19 to induce them, when I did start having periods I then started to have them I had no feelings towards them. I doubt many people do but I thought they‚Äôd make me feel more like a woman but I still felt nothing and carried on life as normal.

- also due to PCOS I started growing facial hair which I HATED and I deffo felt like my body was turning me the wrong gender. Then when I started birth control my boobs started to grow a little and I felt uncomfortable. Not in the same way as the facial hair but still not overly positive. Since getting treatment for PCOS the only symptom I now struggle with is my weight. 

- Two years ago I decided to try wear a dress for the first time since I was a small child and I HATED it. I felt like a was dressing in drag. I was incredibly uncomfortable the whole time and that it wasn‚Äôt me. I feel horrible when I wear a skirt too. I only feel comfortable in baggy blouses, shirts, T-shirt‚Äôs, jumpers, and jeans. In the past I have always shopped in both the men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs since I was able to start choosing my own clothes as a child. 

- looking back I felt gender neutral on the inside as a child and I‚Äôve never cared for gender roles nor wanted them either. I‚Äôve always believed people should express themselves how they want and not follow societies rules on what you should and shouldn‚Äôt do in regards to how you dress and what job you have. 

- I do enjoy feminine things such as having nice hair, make up, sparkly things, and jewellery. But I also enjoy masculine things such as DIY, cars, gaming, and hanging out with beer around a BBQ. 

- I‚Äôve had moments in the past where I introspect and feel like I am not fully a woman for the past 3 years. 

- I don‚Äôt feel fully connected to my body and when I think about downstairs I sometimes wish there was nothing there at all. 

- I also sometimes catch myself thinking that I wished I was intersex so that there could be an explanation to how I feel. 

- however, I am perfectly happy with she/her pronouns. They/them and he/him don‚Äôt quite feel right. I am also happy with having long hair, wearing make up and bling and being seen as a woman despite how I feel internally. 

- I mostly feel like I am gender less and I would like to live a life not following gender norms and doing my own thing and expressing myself in a way that is comfortable for me. On the inside I am gender free. 

I understand that autistic people and lesbians can have a complicated relationship with gender. And I completely get how the symptoms of PCOS make you feel less like a woman. 

But when I tried talking to a nonbinary friend and they said I was cis... it didn‚Äôt feel right. 

I feel as though I could possible be a nonbinary femme or agender.

But I also enjoy masculine things such as DIY, cars, gaming, and hanging out with beer around a BBQ. \n\n- I‚Äôve had moments in the past where I introspect and feel like I am not fully a woman for the past 3 years. \n\n- I don‚Äôt feel fully connected to my body and when I think about downstairs I sometimes wish there was nothing there at all. \n\n- I also sometimes catch myself thinking that I wished I was intersex so that there could be an explanation to how I feel. \n\n- however, I am perfectly happy with she/her pronouns. They/them and he/him don‚Äôt quite feel right. I am also happy with having long hair, wearing make up and bling and being seen as a woman despite how I feel internally. \n\n- I mostly feel like I am gender less and I would like to live a life not following gender norms and doing my own thing and expressing myself in a way that is comfortable for me. On the inside I am gender free. \n\nI understand that autistic people and lesbians can have a complicated relationship with gender. And I completely get how the symptoms of PCOS make you feel less like a woman. \n\nBut when I tried talking to a nonbinary friend and they said I was cis... it didn‚Äôt feel right. \n\nI feel as though I could possible be a nonbinary femme or agender. But before I explore more I would like to hear what other nonbinary people aside from my friend had to say?', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Am I on the nonbinary spectrum?', 'created': 1592555508.0}"

Aryan (I like the sound of it, it sounds a little bit feminine but it's okay because its a cool name, idk ?)

Merle (it's cute and it's a bird name in french, but it also sounds like the french word for ""sh*t"" and I'm scared people will always make joke about it... Also I've been seeing a lot of those birds in my life in general)

I‚Äôm now two years out of college and while I still assert that I‚Äôm NB every now and then, I accept any pronouns, though of course people mostly use my assigned at birth pronouns. I present pretty in line with my assigned gender but am starting to explore clothing a lot more. I was very nervous to tell my boyfriend that but he has been supportive of my clothing expression.

recently I‚Äôve been realizing more and more that I have been treating myself as (I‚Äôm gonna let it loose now, I was AMAB) a fluid man rather than an NB - specifically in that I‚Äôve been accepting other people to treat me that way instead of asserting my pronouns.

I‚Äôm considering a name change. I‚Äôm considering freeing my clothing up in public spaces much more. I‚Äôm considering really asserting they/them pronouns. and I‚Äôm kind of terrified. (Mercury Retrograde probably isn‚Äôt helping am I right ladies?)

my boyfriend of 3 yrs has been so lovely. I‚Äôm terrified to tell him I‚Äôm currently in the starting pages of a Transition. I‚Äôm terrified to tell him I need new pronouns and perhaps a different ‚Äútitle‚Äù in his life (joyfriend, partner, something like that). especially bc he has not yet come out to his family that he‚Äôs in an LGBTQIA presenting relationship at all.

(of course, he‚Äôs been blocked and is no longer family in my eyes, but... nevertheless). I know I won‚Äôt be able to express fully around certain family members for reasons of financial support and stability, etc, but I am worried about my parents still. 

I guess I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm looking for.

For a while I felt like I was a mtf transgender but recently that doesn't fit anymore and I've been feeling very confused about who I am. I found a few sources of non-binary information and this feels like it fits now.

Having said that, I feel like I need some support with regards to decisions I want to start making about myself and the way I look. I've had short hair my entire life and I want to start growing it out. I spoke with my mom about it and she initially said that it would be fine but a few days ago she said that I wouldn't be allowed around her. She knows about the issues I've faced with regard to my gender and the dysphoria I've felt about it. She's said to me before that she can see I'm not happy and that I need to start chasing things that will make me happy.

How do I start a discussion where I want to say to her that I value your opinion and I want your advice but I'm going to do this anyway and there's not a damn thing that you can do to stop me?

I've struggled with my mental health my entire life because I was sexually abused by my brother when we were children and that experience has shaped so much of who I am and she knows that because of what happened I am still struggling to find out who I am and what that means to me. I can't remember a single day where I felt comfortable with saying this is who I am.

I've only recently felt safe enough to start exploring who I am and what I feel and to be supported initially and then soundly rejected by my own mother hurts like hell. I'm fucking 28 years old and I feel like I'm still a child to her. I want to tell her that I am done with people making decisions for me, especially about what I wear and how I look because those decisions were always made by her. She picked out the clothes I wore and when I got a haircut and basically ruled over my life and now all that is, is stifling.

I don't depend on her, I'm married and we're living on our own. Why should she get a say in how I look? To try and hold our relationship prisoner just because you're afraid of how I may look with a different hairstyle is crazy.

Anyway, in summary, I've never done this before, I need advice on how to start a conversation with a draconian overlord about my own choices and I would just generally like some support from someone else because I don't have anyone to turn to outside of the internet.

The problem is being AFAB femme I present as a woman, I deal with female reproductive issues, and I gave women's issues like harassment...so to a degree I feel like I have to identify as a woman. 

It makes it very difficult when discussing feminism and I say 'As a woman...' because I'm not but it's easier/more effective than explaining I'm an AFAB femme nonbinary, you know? If I have to fill out forms and there's no 'Mx' then I put 'Miss'. 

I'm percieved as a woman so I can so easily go along with that, but it also erases my identity...BUT as an AFAB femme being percieved as a woman means I have the experiences of a woman in society and deal with sexism as a woman. You know?

I *joke* with my (cis male) boyfriend about gender ideas eg. saying I don't pass gas as women folk don't do such things, that he has to deal with spiders as he's the man, etc. I know I don't have to worry about him being sexist or transphobic (nonbinary-phobic), but part of me still worries it will lead him to not take my gender seriously, because I play on these ideas because socially I am considered a woman. I told him I'm nonbinary and he was fine with it but sort of diminished that I consider myself as being under the trans umbrella and although I know he understands being nonbinary it still felt a little like he doesn't regard me as a real nonbinary person due to this. 

~sigh~ I'm not sure even how to explain this to you all right now, not sure if it's my struggles to communicate or the problems of trying to express my nonbinary identity in a binary gender world.  

IDK I just find it so difficult to navigate through a world where things are so gendered when I don't feel part of that whole gender binary...and I feel like due to this I stagger too close to being a woman to be taken seriously as nonbinary. Imposter syndrome.

2020-06-21 19:44:33,hdd5pi,2,1,"Disclaimer: I am cis, and I am slightly confused, hoping to get some trans perspectives on this topic.

On the topic of pronouns, which I‚Äôve seen more of in the last few years at school, on social media, and when looking into it on the internet, I‚Äôve heard multiple and often contradictory things about what trans people think or what best practices are. I have personal experience with this, having a transgender sibling.

I understand the first thing, which is that the correct pronouns are the ones someone wants you to use. No discussion. This seems like obvious, basic politeness, that intentionally misgendering someone is wrong.

Beyond that, it seems based on my research online, on trans subreddits, and in real life that there are conflicting opinions on stuff like:
- ‚Äúrespecting‚Äù people‚Äôs presentation/passing by assuming their gender
- passing is cisnormative and pronoun sharing should be normalized
- mandatory or optional pronoun sharing in introductions is good/bad
- asking ALL people for their pronouns because you shouldn‚Äôt assume gender or pronouns
- asking TRANS people for their pronouns in LGBT+ spaces
- asking for pronouns is dysphoric/I like when people assume my gender or are confused by my presentation (Contrapoints got cancelled for this or something like it  because it‚Äôs bad for non-binary people?)
- introducing yourself with your pronouns to set an inclusive tone
- asking for pronouns in public/private is good/bad
- pronoun discussion forces trans people to put themselves or be misgendered
- using only gender-neutral pronouns like ‚Äúthey‚Äù for all people
- better to ask than assume if you‚Äôre UNSURE about someone‚Äôs gender
And so on

Based on my experience in real life with my sibling and others, my current understanding is that pronoun sharing is good because it signals that people and institutions are trans-friendly, but in most day to day cases you should read a person‚Äôs gender presentation (masculine, feminine, androgynous) and infer their gender and pronouns out of respect for that. However, if you‚Äôre unsure or read conflicting signals (or see a pronoun button), it‚Äôs better to not make any assumptions and wait for more information, or else ask the person in a private and polite way.

2020-06-21 21:54:26,hdfecn,9,4,"Hi everyone, I've been lurking for a while, and made an account to introduce myself then never got around to it.
Anyway, I've learnt soooo much from y'all. And can I just say the positivity in here is amazing!

The thing that really got me was learning about dysphoria, and it was like a magnificent light bulb going off in my head. I didn't know that it was a thing, and it's helped me make so much sense of everything I've been feeling.

Due to the current lockdown, today was the first time I got dressed for the outside world (rather than general house clothes or pyjamas) and I had my usual meltdown with chosing what to wear. 
I am AFAB and chose a ""woman's"" top- that kicked off my meltdown. Or thats what I've always called my hatred and disgust at how I looked- a meltdown. 

That's when I realised its not a meltdown. It's dysphoria. And I was suddenly so happy to realise it was dysphoria causing all of my self hatred and zero confidence, that I was sobbing happy tears as I changed into a ""men's"" baggy tshirt.

I've always been unhappy being a girl/woman/lady, but never wanted to be a boy/man. And never knew until recently that nonbinary existed. As soon as I started reading more in to it, the happier I've become within myself.

I sincerely hope I haven't used the wrong words, or said them in an offensive way. I want to learn and be respectful so please correct me if I said something wrong.

2020-06-22 19:14:45,hdyqfb,4,1,"I'm so, so, so confused. I feel inside a man, and in my inner world and fantasy I am a man, I identify with male characters and so on... as long as the outside world is not involved I have no trouble being a man. By that I mean an androgynous man, a man who is freely effeminate, with long hair, a masculine voice, a flat chest and no extra focus on private parts. Basically a neuter-man with no emphasis on macho-hood but a he.

The biggest problem is that I see a man in the mirror. People says they see a woman and this trigger a crisis: I'm not, why they can't see? I truly see a guy in the mirror, exactly as I am. Ok, I ignore some female-like shapes, but I want to get rid of that. The other problem? I don't want to go the medical route, no hormones or surgeries. I weighted pros and cons and how I feel deep down, and I'm sure I don't want it. The only reason to be biologically male would be to have the lovers I dream of, because I like men and I get shunned as the ""lonely lesbian who is here by mistake"" at gay events. But I can't have that body in a safe, functional way with no side effects so I have decided not to go the surgery/T way. 

The other thing besides not wanting the medical transition is that I am not macho at all. If you want a pop-culture reference, think about Tolkien's Elves or K-pop androgynous artists. Long hair and everything. I want a supple lean body, more rhythmic gymnastics than judo (I did martial arts a lot, no bashing here). 

Aaaand... I am jealous of some female clothes. Part of it is because I'm bickering with male clothes a lot: the top part looks oversized, the lower part has given me varicose veins due to constriction. I feel gorgeous like nothing else in the male clothes that fit me well, but they are a rare thing. Most men's clothes are a depressing blu/black/grey/white plain items, that doesn't hug my figure. I am the leggings type, given a chance. So I see these colourful female clothes in all colours and soft fabrics and I feel that I am making a mistake. Probably the trousers feel better on my legs too, blood-circulation-wise. But that invalidates my gender a lot, I could pull off that or goth/emo makeup if I was on T or had surgeries, and I won't.

I have been toying with other gender identities, but the point is that people will see me as a type of girl, not of man. The thing: ""you can do/be what you want as a woman"" like Soldier Jane is just about the opposite of how I feel inside. 

So... who on Earth am I on the spectrum?",NonBinary,Can I be a man if I don't want medical interventions and sometimes I like more feminine clothes?,1592878485.0,"{'created_utc': 1592853285, 'id': 'hdyqfb', 'num_comments': 4, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'I\'m so, so, so confused. I feel inside a man, and in my inner world and fantasy I am a man, I identify with male characters and so on... as long as the outside world is not involved I have no trouble being a man. By that I mean an androgynous man, a man who is freely effeminate, with long hair, a masculine voice, a flat chest and no extra focus on private parts. Basically a neuter-man with no emphasis on macho-hood but a he.\n\nThe biggest problem is that I see a man in the mirror. People says they see a woman and this trigger a crisis: I\'m not, why they can\'t see? I truly see a guy in the mirror, exactly as I am. Ok, I ignore some female-like shapes, but I want to get rid of that. The other problem? I don\'t want to go the medical route, no hormones or surgeries. I weighted pros and cons and how I feel deep down, and I\'m sure I don\'t want it. The only reason to be biologically male would be to have the lovers I dream of, because I like men and I get shunned as the ""lonely lesbian who is here by mistake"" at gay events. But I can\'t have that body in a safe, functional way with no side effects so I have decided not to go the surgery/T way. \n\nThe other thing besides not wanting the medical transition is that I am not macho at all. If you want a pop-culture reference, think about Tolkien\'s Elves or K-pop androgynous artists. Long hair and everything. I want a supple lean body, more rhythmic gymnastics than judo (I did martial arts a lot, no bashing here). \n\nAaaand... I am jealous of some female clothes. Part of it is because I\'m bickering with male clothes a lot: the top part looks oversized, the lower part has given me varicose veins due to constriction. I feel gorgeous like nothing else in the male clothes that fit me well, but they are a rare thing. Most men\'s clothes are a depressing blu/black/grey/white plain items, that doesn\'t hug my figure. I am the leggings type, given a chance. So I see these colourful female clothes in all colours and soft fabrics and I feel that I am making a mistake.

And yes I know you can be feminine and be a boy and I'm in the subreddit's like ftmfemininity. I just never want to go on T and it feels like no one has similar experiences to mine sometimes.

Anyway, because I never wanna go on T I'm definitely doomed to being seen as a woman forever which already hurts a lot, but on top of that I have a ton of bottom dysphoria.

I recently found some makeup products I wanted to recommend to everyone, I‚Äôm AFAB and when I‚Äôm feeling more masc I like to darken/fill in my eyebrows. I feel like that little thing does wonders for smashing disphoria. 

So specifically I recommend Colourpop Cosmetics, Brow Boss and Brow Boss Gel. Either do the trick, but I do find myself using the basic brow boss more often cuz I feel I have a little more control compared to the gel. 

And a side note, Colourpop is a wonderful company, I really stand for what they believe in. I had an order in for these products before the pandemic shut down and I was more than happy to wait until they started production again. I just think they‚Äôre the best!

then my body dysphoria kind of... stopped? and i know you don't need dysphoria to be trans. but it was still a weird thing. i still id'd transmasc but... my dysphoria was gone. which is amazing, because dysphoria sucks hard, but also weird bc I had built a lot of my identity around it

so I've been floating in this weird space since then and my gender feelings have gotten much more feminine and idk what that means or what to do with it. like...i went thru a legal name change, i use they/them, everyone around me knows me as nb. but i feel much closer to my agab right now, and idk what that means.

2020-06-24 11:58:25,hezqr0,2,1,"Okay so this happened last year at a christmas party in the school that I go to; which I was looking forward to because I stylized and repurposed my own party/event outfits (been doing it since I came out.)

I got an old shirt and turned it into a crop top, Used some high waist shorts and combat boots to match (also with nets). I saved up money for having my makeup done by professional makeup artist since I really can't do make-up for nuts and I wanna look as pretty as possible.

A few hours before the event I got ready for the party. I ironed out my clothes, organized my accessories, and hid it in my secret space. Even though I came out way back in 2018, my family still isn't fond of the whole ""dressing up"" thing, so the clothes and the makeup session is done in secret. 

After all the prep is done, the outfit on my body and the makeup on my face (which, by the way, is done BEAUTIFULLY. Highlight to the gods, Electric blue glitter eyeshadow fantasy, all the biz.) , I went home to get my stuff. The whole family is there, which is NOT good for my anxiety. They had this LOOK. You know, *THE LOOK*. The look of Disapproval and resentment. THE LOOK. Lots of them had things to say like ""that's too much make-up."" ""you're still a boy."" ""Don't be too loud."" 

I felt really really small when my uncle asked if I really had to do this, like it was unnecessary for me to feel good about myself and feel valid. 

Then, this little bundle of joy named Elizabeth, youngest daughter of the said Uncle, age 4, just looked at me with sparkling eyes, looking up at me like I saved the world. With a grin, and amazement in her voice, she gleefully shouted ""Anon's so pretty!!!"" and I said to myself ""this is it. Those three words are the reason why I'm still fighting."" I never got so much adoration and acceptance, let alone from a child who lived in a world where elders say girls should wear pink skirts and boys, blue pants. 

and I loved Eliz for that. I might have held back tears so my eyeliner doesn't run.

For people with the same struggle, just know that I am here to be your Elizabeth. I am here-- adoring you and loving you. You are beautiful. Whatever you are, you're valid. I am here as a safe space for all the people who felt like their home isn't a safer place. I am here. I hear you. I feel you. I adore you for being so brave.

""Don\'t be too loud."" \n\nI felt really really small when my uncle asked if I really had to do this, like it was unnecessary for me to feel good about myself and feel valid. \n\nThen, this little bundle of joy named Elizabeth, youngest daughter of the said Uncle, age 4, just looked at me with sparkling eyes, looking up at me like I saved the world. With a grin, and amazement in her voice, she gleefully shouted ""Anon\'s so pretty!!!"" and I said to myself ""this is it. Those three words are the reason why I\'m still fighting."" I never got so much adoration and acceptance, let alone from a child who lived in a world where elders say girls should wear pink skirts and boys, blue pants. \n\nand I loved Eliz for that. I might have held back tears so my eyeliner doesn\'t run.\n\nFor people with the same struggle, just know that I am here to be your Elizabeth. I am here-- adoring you and loving you. You are beautiful. Whatever you are, you\'re valid. I am here as a safe space for all the people who felt like their home isn\'t a safer place. I am here. I hear you. I feel you. I adore you for being so brave. I love you all.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': ""My 4-year old cousin told me I'm pretty"", 'created': 1593025105.0}"

I am 20, AMAB, currently present male and always have. I went to an all boys secondary/high school and was on the receiving end of a lot of homophobic partly because that's what teenage boys do but also because I was more effeminate and less stereotypically manly than others, but I always chalked this down to just being more comfortable and less toxic (I hope), although this experience certianly inhibited  my social skills and mental health. 

Recently I have been consider my gender identity and expression. I don't think I have ever experienced  dysphoria with my body and I am basically very fearful as coming out to someone as being non-binary or questioning or something when I am kinda comfortable in my male presenting body and I am only interested in women sexually and I think also romantically. As I have said I am more effeminate and on several occasions I have experimented with how I present but never to a massively significant degree. I am also put off by my Dad who vehemently defended Rowling and took great offence to me calling her a TERF, I am not living at home for much longer but I don't know what to do. I fear that I am feeling other things and am reaching out to the community as something to latch onto but the more I think about it the more experiences I can remember not wanting to fit into the male expectations or with my male friends but is this just me overthinking it I do not know. I am hoping once I have moved out to be able to experiment with my presentation and identity more. 

One thing I do come back to, and I apologise for this pervyness, but when thinking about, reading, or viewing pornography, I identify and self insert into Lesbian or Gender nonspecific characters which I feel is more than just part of some kink or fetish, I cannot watch or read content where there is a male insert or a male sexual character. I wish I could compare this to how I have felt in relationships with women but I have not had a particularly healthy track record of relationships but I actively dislike many of the expectations had upon me as a man and do feel some sort of sense of disassociation with being a man in a sexual situation. I cannot vouch for this, but I also have been told by a couple of partners that I do not act like other men in bed and I do not find things like bjs or handjobs at all appealing because I really dislike that dynamic in general but particularly in bed but this is all much more sexual than part of my gender I really don't know.  I apologise if this is too personal or TMI I am kinda just venting here trying to make sense of how I feel.

I have had battles with my mental health but I haven't really felt alienated from my body itself and I don;t want to coopt a term that doesn't apply to me. I don't know how to figure out what counts as 'enough' dysphoria for me to be Enby in this way. I had asked a MTF Trans friend of mine how important dysphoria was to them and the people they knew and they said that 'if you aren't dysphoric why would you want to change your gender?'

Timeline

Cliche ""wHEn i wAS a LiTtLE bOY i lOVEd pLaYIng wItH DOLLS"":

When I was little I never really understood gender's place in society. I never got why it was that girls couldn't do X because they were girls and the inverse. This was a pretty BASED position, but even more I never understood why I had to BE a boy. I never identified with being a boy as opposed to being myself around the age of 8-10, despite being super boyish (especially when I was a little kid). 

I got a little bit older and thought, ""I must be woman."" Mainly because I had the STRONGEST desire to not conform to my sex. However, I thought about it more and realized that I didn't desire to be a woman, I just didn't want to ""be a man"". I thought I wanted to live as a feminine guy, and that would be the end of that. The question ""Do you want to be a woman?"" was answered with uncertainty and became a no.

I then thought I wanted to present as the opposite sex, but I realized I didn't want that. I don't want lipstick and high heels all the time. Even if I did, being just ""a guy"" hurts me on the inside. The idea of being a ""woman"" hurts me the more I think about it. This may sound weird, but I want to present as ambigiously as possible. I'm reluctant to join the ""enby community"" because I HATE having exclusive labels. In the eyes of society I want to be a person. If you want to call me she/he/they, then cool. I just want to be seen to the point where they are interchangable. I hate that I'm a guy and my looks are masculine. I want to exist as myself.

I have a feeling people are gonna call me ""greedy"" or a ""transtrender"".

My desires are:

1. Complete androgyny in order for me to not hate my physical body.

2. Complete androgyny in order for me to fit societally as neither and have gender ambiguity.

TL;DR: I found out I don't want to be a ""man"" or ""woman"" because I geniunely hate the exclusivity.

2020-06-25 10:53:00,hfk1ww,1,1,"I am an androgynous afab men, and for the last 5 years I tried hard to prove that I am a real dude by wearing macho clothes and cutting my hair shirt (horrible, I'm slowly getting back my long hair). Unfortunately I gained 10 kg that I am still trying to shed, so there is nothing that can make me look good really. I don't really like the dime-a-dozen sport's clothes look but that's what is comfortable with my shapes now... I look like a kid or a particularly sporty butch lesbian, and I am very unhappy with that.

The point is that I also want a dainty ethereal look, like a refined elf or vampire or k-pop idol, something lithe. Yes, I need to lose weight. But I also missed something less aggressive, less ""construction worker"", something dainty and light so I thought that buying female clothes would be a good idea. Nothing girly, sports things, and underwear because the men's underpants have elastic bands that were creating a tourniquet on my hip joints that gave me varicose veins (I regret this hard).

The result is that I am buying and throwing away cheap clothes for both sexes, and it's expensive given the turnaround. I am not comfortable with female underwear because I'm not a Barbie doll down there and I need the space allowed by male underwear, but there is the elastic band problem. I refuse to wear XL sizes, it's too humiliating and I also want something with as little fabric as possible. This is one thing that I hate about men's underwear and swimwear, there is way way way too much fabric. But the female things flatten my private parts in a way that is too uncomfortable after 5 years of men's underwear. And the trousers too. I can't fit men's trousers because of my tights size, but female clothes have this problem of the crotch with no space.

I am also fighting hard against tops, because it gives me dysphoria having this extra fat in the chest... I went from being told by the doctor for breast checkups that I had almost no fat to be told that I have now 50/50 and it's starting to sag which gives me dysphoria to the sky. I don't want to wear bras, but the things I used that were from a brand that has closed shops in this country are not available anymore. I feel uncomfortable going around with nothing on and people stare, I'll do that when I'm flat-ish enough to do so, but everything I can wear screams ""you have boobs... woman"". And there is the heat problem (32 ¬∞C here) with binder-like bras.

I also feel especially uncomfortable because I like my armpit hair but I want to look gorgeous and people think I'm an unclean woman if I wear female swimsuits with no shaving. And I have no idea why, but I like my hair with female clothes but hates it hard with men's clothes: all of a sudden my hair is flat and dirty and weirdly cut (shoulders length).

For context, I am a biological male who identifies as non-binary (specifically libramasculine, but non-binary is more understood). I go by they/them pronouns. Sexually speaking, I am a switch. I enjoy taking the lead and dominating but I also really want to be seduced and submissive as well.

I only discovered my true gender identity relatively recently, so all of my precious sexual experiences were with cisgender females. And all of them preferred to be a sub. Which was fine. I saw it as normal at the time for me to be the one to take control as the male in the relationship. However, now that I‚Äôm much more open to how I feel about my sexuality, I am DYING to be pursued or dominated. 

It‚Äôs obvious to tell that I am biologically male. It‚Äôs not something I care too much about hiding in my day to day clothes. However, I am only sexually attracted to biological females (regardless of their gender identity. Is there a term for that?). But, as someone who appears male, I have found that there is NO WAY to cue that you want to be flirted with and the one who is pursued by them.

If I dress feminine, it‚Äôs generally assumed that I‚Äôm gay and not interested in cisgender females, and I don‚Äôt meet trans men very often. If I dress masculine, it‚Äôs assumed I‚Äôm just a normal guy and that I should take the lead on things.

I asked some people about this, but they got upset with me for it, because I use she/they pronouns and my outer appearance is still pretty feminine besides my clothing (the last time my hair was short was in middle school, when I was closeted lol my therapist said I was trying to push away from the feminine stereotype everyone had placed on me) 

Am I non-binary? Is there another term for what I‚Äôve described?? I‚Äôve looked at terms like gender queer before but I never really felt the connection to it. 

I don‚Äôt want to end up using the term non-binary if what I identify as is truly not non-binary (like people who say gay men can date/be attracted to women, it‚Äôs simply not true and is not the definition of the word gay)

Is this still under non binary or is it something else?? \n\nI asked some people about this, but they got upset with me for it, because I use she/they pronouns and my outer appearance is still pretty feminine besides my clothing (the last time my hair was short was in middle school, when I was closeted lol my therapist said I was trying to push away from the feminine stereotype everyone had placed on me) \n\nAm I non-binary? Is there another term for what I‚Äôve described?? I‚Äôve looked at terms like gender queer before but I never really felt the connection to it. \n\nI don‚Äôt want to end up using the term non-binary if what I identify as is truly not non-binary (like people who say gay men can date/be attracted to women, it‚Äôs simply not true and is not the definition of the word gay) \n\nPlease let me know what you think. \n\nI love you all, lovely gorgeous people.

I identified as FtM for several years, and have been on testosterone for 4 of them. My main sources of dysphoria were my voice and chest. My voice is in a fairly androgynous range now and can be read as male or female depending on on who I‚Äôm talking to, and I have plans to get top surgery. However, since being at home with my thoughts during quarantine, I‚Äôve begun to think more seriously about my gender. 

I moved back to the nonbinary identity a little while back, but I‚Äôve recently been really wishing I were more feminine. I don‚Äôt look conventionally masculine in my presentation, but I‚Äôve been really bothered by stuff like my facial hair and slightly thinned hair. My skin is really uneven so I trim with clippers instead of shaving with razors, but that isn‚Äôt enough to completely get rid of my thick, dark facial hair. I still have the hair on my head, but my hairline has changed a lot and it‚Äôs not as thick as it used to be. I feel like I‚Äôll never read as feminine as I‚Äôd like to no matter what I do because of that. Stuff like my clothing and hairstyle affirm me, but I feel like it‚Äôs just a band-aid. 

I‚Äôve been wondering recently if I would‚Äôve been happier if I‚Äôd only pursued top surgery instead of also taking hormones. I could‚Äôve been more androgynous. I also feel like taking hormones really alienated me from the sapphic community as well, as it was a big part of my identity and I find myself preferring women again.

I'm AFAB and like being feminine, but I'd like to do so in such a way that makes me pass as either binary side. Kind of like I could be mistaken as male or female but still garner a double take. ""True androgyny"" as I call it.

But I'm having trouble with my hair. I've had short hair for a while now and I've grown tired of it, using the quarantine to grow it out. I cant decide if I want to stop at a sleek bob or if I want to grow it out even longer. But in any case, whenever I see AFAB people passing as androgynous inspiration, they usually have very short cropped hair like Rain Dove, Grace Jones, Ruby Rose, etc, whether they are leaning more on the masculine or feminine side. 

Does anyone have any suggestions or examples of hair styles from a chin-length bob or longer that can still look androgynous? I currently have an awkward haircut resembling a middle school boy who decided to stop cutting his hair. Thanks in advance! Also I'm really sorry if I said anything offensive.

It's untenable, I have been here for 3 years and counting and there is 7 of us in just enough space. I have my own room but I have to hide my laundry to avoid showing male underwear etc. I'm going to go now that job-wise I can (deposit to be paid plus permanent contract).

However, I cannot afford anything in this city (I work here) unless is 25 sq mt in a dirty dangerous periphery with run down buildings, nothing else. So I think I'll move either in a 130k city that is 15 minutes by train or in one of the many 20k towns at the same distance by subway.

My huge problem is the small-town mentality. I already feel terrified, like trying already to deny my gender identity or my passion for multiculturalism just to fit in in my future neighbourhood. I shouldn't give up on myself like this. I grew up in a 80k city where conservatism was rampant, 1 h from this big city. I hope that 130k and 15 min from the city will make for a better mentality, but the city has a reputation of rich-and-bigot inhabitants.

The 20k towns are places where there is nothing, and I would like to avoid that. At least the 130k city has kung fu, bharatanatyam, ballet for adults and swimming like the big city. But... can I go there as a man, dancing male roles in male clothes or swimming in trunks plus top? I don't know.

On the other hand, my best friends assume that I will live outwardly as a ""woman"" and I'm not sure I can deal with that. Even if to be honest here in the city my all neighbours and flatmates have no idea about my gender identity, so what gives?

I have synesthesia so the difference between the two is pretty sensory. Tuesday is bright, present, productive/aspirational and feels like a balmy ocean day. Deep mint green, bright yellow, and nautical blue come to mind. Tuesday feels like a cooling bath and humid day. Lovely surf pop feelings.

My current top choice at the moment is ""Luka"" (https://www.babynames.com/name/luka https://behindthename.com/name/luka).

My question is, what are your first impressions/thoughts on hearing this name, like if someone androgynous introduced themselves as it - more masculine? Feminine?

I want to start by coming out to my mom, but I don't know how. She's somewhat conservative, but generally accepting.

I remember being 3 or 4, watching the news with my parents, and there was an interview with a trans man. I was amazed and said I wanted to do that.

I have also heard my mom say she would be fine if I were gay.

I'm not as sure about what she thinks about it in general. She did tell me once that she accidentally misgendered a trans person and felt really guilty about it.

However, some things make me nervous. For example, my friend asked me to be a bridesmaid, and said I could wear a tux if I wanted, without me asking (I'm not out to her either!).

I mentioned it to my mom, but she got unexpectedly angry and said stuff like ""Would it be that hard to just wear a dress"". I said it didn't matter, I just was happy that my friend had already thought about it. My mom did apologize later, though, and I think she understood.

So, I'm just worried she'll get like that again. I kind of rely on her for support (much more emotionally than financially). My gut feeling is that she just might not understand at first, but she would accept me.

I don't even think she knows what nonbinary means, so should I start by asking her how she feels about it, or should I just tell her outright?

For example, my friend asked me to be a bridesmaid, and said I could wear a tux if I wanted, without me asking (I\'m not out to her either!).\n\nI mentioned it to my mom, but she got unexpectedly angry and said stuff like ""Would it be that hard to just wear a dress"". I said it didn\'t matter, I just was happy that my friend had already thought about it. My mom did apologize later, though, and I think she understood.\n\nSo, I\'m just worried she\'ll get like that again. I kind of rely on her for support (much more emotionally than financially). My gut feeling is that she just might not understand at first, but she would accept me.\n\nI don\'t even think she knows what nonbinary means, so should I start by asking her how she feels about it, or should I just tell her outright? Plus I don\'t know if I should wait for lockdown to be over so I can tell her in person, or just tell her over the phone instead.

Disclaimer, I am not critical of the discussion at all, I just hate feeling invalid. I stress though that this wasn't the intention

I identify as having a neutral gender but I get a lot of dysphoria from the idea of still having a ""male brain"". Whilst I know I can't change the structure of my brain, it feels invalidating for me both as nonbinary and an ace. 

The post outlines a few hypotheses for why there are more AFAB people who identify as nonbinary/ace. The general idea came down to differences in brain structure and societal opression.

Ultimately, the conclusion was that more AFAB people identity as ace and/or nb because of pressure of sexualisation from society and the fact that their biology is different.

This made me feel so invalidated. All that's going through my head is that because I have male biology, I must be hypersexual because the chemicals in my body tell me I should be. 
And conflating gender and sexuality in the way they did just made me feel bad too. Yes, I do get dysphoria from the idea that someone could be attracted to me physically based on my male anatomy but I actually discovered I was nb way before I was ace and whilst they aren't completely mutually exclusive, my identity of ace is simply because I don't have sexual attraction. 
The idea that we feel could feel sexual attraction based on the chemicals in our bodies got me quite hard. The unfortunate nature of my biology means that I have a high libido but that doesn't mean I should be hypersexual and be sexually attracted to people.
I guess that comes back to this idea of my male brain structure. 

TL;DR: My dysphoria comes from the fact that I will forever have a male brain structure and male chemicals  pumping around in my body which society says should make me exhibit typically male behaviours

I think that's the first time I've fully confronted my dysphoria like that. If you've got this far, thank you for reading, I hope you have/are having a good day.

Ps: I don't want to go on HRT because I feel that would make this whole ordeal worse because the idea that I should change what chemicals are in my blood to be accepted is a part of the problem.

But even though, something inside me feels like... like i'm actually neutral on the inside.

Event though, I'm satisfied with the way I look... I wouln't be comfortable with looking androgynous because It is just not esthetic style. I got used to looking feminine and I'm comfortable with it... or at least I think so... I haven't tried anything different.

I am not sure if this is an actual gender issue I have with myself or just some kind of insecurity about being a woman?

2020-06-29 00:48:37,hhq499,8,0,"Hi everyone!

As the title says I was wondering if anyone would be happy to help further my understanding of non-binary as a concept?

I learnt a bit about trans and body dysmorphia in psychology at school so have felt fairly comfortable with my understanding of one‚Äôs gender and sex not matching and wanting to change that with surgery and/or hormones but I find non-binary a lot more difficult to wrap my head around.

I‚Äôve seen a few lists of multiple different genders (such as this one https://images.app.goo.gl/HRNDWP6JbiUdTCuW7) and I just don‚Äôt get it or see what the need is for so many different genders. I‚Äôm not trying to be inflammatory but I just struggle to accept a concept that I can‚Äôt understand. 

I‚Äôm familiar with the idea that gender is a social construct but I‚Äôm just not sure why there need to be so many?

I think everyone should be able to do whatever they want and express themselves however they feel fit and to be happy, but the idea of dozens of genders just doesn‚Äôt make sense to me.

In terms of biological sex, you‚Äôre either born male or female right? (Or intersex which I hear is as common being ginger!) And then if you feel your sex does not correspond with who you are/how you feel you are then you should be able to change that. But then after that why do we even need gender? You have whichever sex organs and hormones you have and that‚Äôs your sex and then you just live your life however you want, no need for any labels. Wouldn‚Äôt that be simpler?

Before I sign off, pretty much everything I‚Äôve gathered about this has come from the internet/twitter and I often see people saying that it is not the burden of X group (I say X as I‚Äôve seen the same point made about racism and feminism, amongst other things) to teach other people about their situations, you should go out and find things out for yourself and do your own research... I‚Äôve tried to do this many times but still can‚Äôt fully grasp the idea of non-binary and the multitude of genders so thought I‚Äôd come here to ask.

2020-06-29 00:58:12,hhq9fl,7,6,"First, let me begin by addressing that yes, this is a throwaway. We have mutual friends on Reddit and I don't want to be outing anyone. Also, I apologize if this sub isn't the place for this, I'm just not sure of any better alternatives, and you all seem like kind folk.

Anyway, I've been in a relationship with someone for a few months now, and she is the most wonderful and remarkable person I've met in ages. I feel like we've connected so much in a relatively short time, more than I ever have with anyone else (even in *significantly* longer relationships).

The other day, she came out to me as preferring to go by they/them pronouns. She explained to me that she doesn't *always* prefer to go by those pronouns, and that most times she feels perfectly fine with she/her (which is why I've been using them here). She's even said that she doesn't mind me continuing to call her my girlfriend, and using my gendered pet names.

I let her know that it doesn't change anything about how I feel towards her, and that *is* the honest truth. I really care about her, and I want to support her and validate her in this. I'd never want to make her feel as though her identity isn't valid or that I don't respect it, but I *would* be lying if I said I completely understand it.

For context, I *am* a bisexual male who has never considered himself as anything other than a male. Maybe that has something to do with it. My gender identity is essentially meaningless to me, and I've always been prone to viewing sex and gender on rather binary terms. But even still, I don't feel like I'd have as hard of a time comprehending her feelings if she *did* insist upon me always using they/them. I'm not uncomfortable with the idea of switching gender identity around like that, but I am completely ignorant of what that's like and what it even *looks* like. I'm not sure why, but it gives me a feeling of anxiety, the root of which I can't really dig up.

But ultimately, I suppose that's irrelevant. She's already come to mean the world to me, and I don't see this as changing anything anytime soon. I really appreciate that she has enough faith and trust in me to come to me with this. I don't know what not being cisgender is like, but I know how terrifying coming out as bi was for me. If any of you want to dig into my anxieties and incomprehension, I'd appreciate it, but it's not really what I'm here to ask (I just felt as though I should give backstory).

What are some measures I can take to ensure she's comfortable, and not being invalidated by me in any way? She's already told me I shouldn't worry too much about this, and that she'll be sure to tell me if I ever do anything contrary to my intentions.

We have mutual friends on Reddit and I don't want to be outing anyone. Also, I apologize if this sub isn't the place for this, I'm just not sure of any better alternatives, and you all seem like kind folk.\n\nAnyway, I've been in a relationship with someone for a few months now, and she is the most wonderful and remarkable person I've met in ages. I feel like we've connected so much in a relatively short time, more than I ever have with anyone else (even in *significantly* longer relationships).\n\nThe other day, she came out to me as preferring to go by they/them pronouns. She explained to me that she doesn't *always* prefer to go by those pronouns, and that most times she feels perfectly fine with she/her (which is why I've been using them here). She's even said that she doesn't mind me continuing to call her my girlfriend, and using my gendered pet names.\n\nI let her know that it doesn't change anything about how I feel towards her, and that *is* the honest truth. I really care about her, and I want to support her and validate her in this. I'd never want to make her feel as though her identity isn't valid or that I don't respect it, but I *would* be lying if I said I completely understand it.\n\nFor context, I *am* a bisexual male who has never considered himself as anything other than a male. Maybe that has something to do with it. My gender identity is essentially meaningless to me, and I've always been prone to viewing sex and gender on rather binary terms. But even still, I don't feel like I'd have as hard of a time comprehending her feelings if she *did* insist upon me always using they/them. I'm not uncomfortable with the idea of switching gender identity around like that, but I am completely ignorant of what that's like and what it even *looks* like. I'm not sure why, but it gives me a feeling of anxiety, the root of which I can't really dig up.\n\nBut ultimately, I suppose that's irrelevant. She's already come to mean the world to me, and I don't see this as changing anything anytime soon. I really appreciate that she has enough faith and trust in me to come to me with this. I don't know what not being cisgender is like, but I know how terrifying coming out as bi was for me. If any of you want to dig into my anxieties and incomprehension, I'd appreciate it, but it's not really what I'm here to ask (I just felt as though I should give backstory).\n\nWhat are some measures I can take to ensure she's comfortable, and not being invalidated by me in any way? She's already told me I shouldn't worry too much about this, and that she'll be sure to tell me if I ever do anything contrary to my intentions. But I don't know, I'd like to prevent even needing to have such conversations if I can help it.

2020-06-29 17:36:43,hi4gat,7,3,"Hi! So some history with my gender identity before we get started. I was born a female, and I definitely had some signs pointing to me being non binary, but, in about April, someone called me ***handsome***. And **boy** that was when something happened. so a few weeks later i think of the label, bigender, and that fit! for about a day. I realized, that wasn't something that felt right. Then boom, genderfluid.

So this stayed longer! It stayed for about 2 months. But then at the starting of june. I again had doubts.

Something didn't feel right.

So for the rest of the month (until 2 days ago) I switched labels to see what one felt right.

None of them made me happy, and I was exhausted from this. I cried a lot, and my friend comforted me, and I cant thank her enough for that.

So i watched some videos, and looked at some non binary people ( I watched some non binary videos before and i always liked it but i was too dumb to realize) and ***BOY***

That was my label. Right there, and im not out to my parents about this, im only out to my friend and the person who made me realize.

So yep, my name is Jasper, im non binary, and my pronouns are they/them he/him

can i get some advice to appear more masculine on the days i want to?

but you know, sneakily, cause my family would be confused even tho they know im a bit masculine.

also when i have to go back to school, and when i tell some people, what do i do if they respond in a nasty way? my school is lgbt+ friendly all the way and i have friends who could back me up but im also super emotional so, how do i not cry on the spot?

He's very open to learning about new things within this community and always listen to what I have to say regarding it.

Ok so It started about 5 months ago - I was going through a rough breakup, I‚Äôd sworn off all men and decided to try dating women and enby people, anything but men. I was on a stupid dating app getting NOWHERE with anyone on the ‚Äúwomen‚Äù section of the site (f*ck gender roles), so I decided to go onto the ‚Äúmen‚Äù side. Instantly, because I present female and have tig ol‚Äô bitties, I started getting attention from a variety of people. I decided to take the piss out of them because none of them were my type and, you know, why not, when I came across the most beautiful person I‚Äôd ever seen. Now my underage, enby ass was convinced they wouldn‚Äôt even look my way, but some how they started talking back... We talked for ages, starting on the app then moving to snapchat, then moving to phone calls, and not even a month later he‚Äôd asked me to be his partner. We‚Äôve now been in a happy relationship for 4 months. He‚Äôs the most amazing thing to ever happen to me, I feel like a little 12 year old with a crush again, and it‚Äôs amazing!!!!!!
