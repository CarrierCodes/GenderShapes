I am 30 and realized I was bi about a year or so ago. It was a process, but I came out a year ago. Anywho, recently I‚Äôve been feeling confused about my gender identity. It‚Äôs extra confusing since I am still sort of embracing my bi identity, particularly since I‚Äôve never been with the same gender, and I‚Äôm in a long term relationship.

It‚Äôs been at the back of my head that maybe I‚Äôm non binary or some other term I‚Äôm not familiar with. Part of this I think was just ignorance on my part. I‚Äôm more femme, though not extreme. And in my head non binary folks didn‚Äôt present as a particular gender. I have learned a lot about it and have realized this is not the case.

I don‚Äôt want to be a man, but I feel like...maybe like being a woman is irrelevant? I mean don‚Äôt get my wrong - of course I am affected by being a woman because misogyny. But I‚Äôm terms of my personal identity it feels very...Gah! I don‚Äôt know! Just like I have been feeling like woman is restrictive or something?

I do think part of my confusion is relating to fear how others in my life will react to a change in my gender identity/expression. I know that‚Äôs putting the car before the horse a bit, but in general it‚Äôs very hardcore me to separate what I want from what others want from me, so I think it is affecting me.

Just so confused! I have a counselor who is well versed in LGBT stuff so I plan to discuss this with her. But I‚Äôm curious to hear from others. Posted this on the bi sub to but curious to hear from folks who have non binary gender identities.

2020-04-01 22:46:50,ftah74,7,1,"I understand that Nonbinary is an umbrella term, but also an identity. I have been contemplating my gender for about a year now. I first thought I was Gender Queer, then decided I was Non-Binary. I have been happy with this term for about 3-4 months. Recently I decided to look at different genders and sexual orientations so that I could become more informed on them and be able to recognize the terms if I meet someone who fits with them.

During my research, I encountered the demi-gender category. I had already known that the terms existed, but I never read into it too much. After reading, I felt that I fit into the demi-boy category. 

**Here's a Bit of Background:**

I was assigned female at birth, but growing up I always felt more attached to male things, and I always secretly wanted to be boy. I went through a dramatic tomboy phase and felt comfortable being with guys and asking like a guy. When I reached 6th or 7th grade I realized I was trying too much and tried to be more feminine like my parents wanted me to be. In 9th and 10th grade I began to explore my sexual orientation, since I was previously only an Ally and I wondered if I fit in somehow. When I discovered that I was Pansexual, I began to think more about my gender identity. If the gender of my partner doesn't affect how I feel about them, should I even care about my own gender? I decided that my gender didn't really matter. 

I have not come out to my parents, as they only consider binary genders valid (male, female). The first time I got an undercut and cut my hair short, my family members and father said that I looked like a boy. I noticed that I didn't mind that they mistook me for a boy, and in fact it made me kind of happy. My family is Mexican and speaks Spanish. Spanish has gendered words (there's really no they/them) and I switch between the feminine and masculine pronouns (I only use masculine ones when my parent's aren't paying too much attention).

This kickstarted my search to discover who I was. 

Back to what I said before, I am comfortable with being non-binary. I am just trying to discover if I fit more with the demi-boy category. I also understand that it's up to me to decided, but I was looking for advice. I don't necessarily mind being addressed as she/her - I have told everyone I've come out to that I have no preference of pronouns. However, I find myself leaning more towards he/they. I fluctuate between presenting as androgynous, feminine, and masculine, but I notice that I dress andro and masculine more. I also have a straight cis-male partner who accepts me as nonbinary and pan. I am trying to consider the position that it would put him in if I leaned more towards being male( demi-boy). I asked him how he would react if I came out as a trans-male. He's told me that he would not feel comfortable addressing me with he/him pronouns, but would continue to love me anyway and would use other pronouns (they/them) and my neutral name to make me feel comfortable.

I have little to no bottom dysphoria. I have severe chest dysphoria. My voice dyshporia varies. My height dysphoria is low key but not overwhelming. Then all the miscellaneous of course varies. I have this stuff figured out. I've lived with it for a while. Shouldn't i know by now what i am. But i kinda do.
I dont feel comfortable with stereotypical feminine things (dresses makeup pronouns) but  i dont know. Its hard to explain. He/him pronouns feel ok but somehow not perfect? But sometimes its perfectly fine. I like masculine hair cuts and style. But other than masculine look and pronouns im fine with some feminine things. I dont think im explaining this right at all.
I never really considered non binary as it never seemed like it would fit me. That i would never understand non binary completely. I still don't obviously as im confused. I would ask for people to use they/them so i could try to get a feel for it but we are in quarantine. My mother has clearly stated that non binary ""is not a thing and they/them is plural"" so theres no hope with that. I cant see my gender therapist (quarantine) 
I just feel very whatever, i dont care how people perceive me as long as it isnt female as that makes me hella dysphoric. Androgy doesnt bother me. I had planned to go on T and i will definitely get top sugery. Getting both would hinder androgy but i dont know if i care yet. I feel like im just existing at this point and i dont know what.
So basically
How did you know you were non binary?
Ideas of if im just a fool or if i could be non binary
What makes non binary dysphoria different/what is it like?

I am AFAB, I don't usually mind being seen as a woman or referred to by she/her pronouns (every once in a while it bothers me, but more often than not I feel either neutral about it or really feel a connection to it.) However, occasionally people I've just met/don't know vey well use they/them pronouns for me or ask for my pronouns (maybe I give off NB vibes? idk!) and it just... makes me feel warm and fuzzy for some reason. I've found myself dreading having to correct them because I liked being referred to as they/them. In online spaces, I've felt the urge to use gender-neutral nicknames and such (because my name is pretty feminine) and not disclose my gender in my profile unless there's no option not to, because I like the idea of appearing neutral and I want others to refer to me that way. 

When I was younger (like early teens) I would often get mistaken for a boy, and I remember just feeling a RUSH of adrenaline every time a store clerk or someone would refer to me as ""he,"" etc. I don't know if I'd feel that way now, though. 

Physically, I often wish I could look more androgynous/ambiguous, but my body shape/height/facial features are very obviously AFAB. I've done research on surgery/hormones, but I don't really feel the need for either.

2020-04-02 23:52:31,ftxgb8,0,1,"Hi everyone!

So, I took me a very long time before having the courage to post my question here. Not sure if it's because I was afraid of being judged or just scared that the answers might not please me.

I came out as trans like 9 month ago. At first, I was convinced I was a girl. Yet with time, some things got in my way and it made me think : do I really want to be a girl? I've always felt like I wasn't a boy, but not *really* a girl neither. Most I could imagine is being a masculine girl. But lately, I've been wondering about non-binarity. And the more I think of it, the more it seems like an answer.

I don't want to make any definitive choice here. I want to explore the possibility of being non binary, and if it isn't enough, I'll explore the possibility of being a woman. 

All this to say : I feel very uncomfortable in my skin right now. Beard, body hair, masculine facial features, no curves... It just doesn't feel *right*. So I'm thinking of HRT. I have an appointment with an endo, yet I don't know her and I'm afraid to not know what to say (I tend to be very anxious around people). So I wanted to know, if any of you is under a low dosage HRT and what does it bring to you? And more, if I think it isn't enough and want a higher dosage, would the fact I was under low dose before change anything? 

Right now, I want to aim for a more andro look, I've already started with clothes, shaving the beard, letting my hair grow. But is a low dose HRT really possible on the long term? Would the changes not be too drastic to not be seen only as a woman?

I'm sorry for the long post and I hope I did not offend anybody with this request - being awkward is my second nature üòÖ

So this further begs the question:\n\n""Even if my gender identity is due, at least in part, to internalized misogynistic standards, does that make it ANY LESS VALID?""\n\nSincerely,\n\nA Questioning Chronic Overthinker', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': '""Am I *really* NB, or is it just internalized misogyny?""', 'created': 1585904987.0}"

&amp;#x200B;

So the media is calling snowflake the first non-binary comic book character, from what i have seen they seem to be a forced stereotype of a non-binary person, but in 1989, the comic book Sandman had a character (Desire of the Endless) who identifies as male, female, both male &amp; female, and neither male nor female. 

&amp;#x200B;

and to any comic-book readers doesn't Desire seem like a better representation?

2020-04-04 04:17:32,fun7o4,6,1,"Hi! I am trying to write a book and one of my characters is non binary but i have some questions about being non binary before i write too much about them because I want to try to portray this character (and the nb community) as accurately as possible. If anyone doesn‚Äôt mind answering some questions i would super appreciate it but if you don‚Äôt want to I really understand. Please be honest with me if these questions upset you and i will take the post down.

First, do you ever wake up some days leaning
more towards one gender than the other? Like a specific day you feel more feminine though perhaps the day before you felt more masculine. Is every day a spectrum or do you usually feel the same every day (hope that makes sense) Also, jumping off of that, do you ever wake up feeling comfortable with a she or he pronoun if you usually go by they/them. I understand you are always non binary but do you ever randomly feel you are she/they, for example, rather than they/them.

Secondly, how do you like being introduced? Would you like people to, off the bat, say ‚Äúthis is ____, they use they/them pronouns‚Äù or something more smooth like ‚ÄúThis is ___. They are really cool‚Äù or would you rather just correct them if it comes up.

Lastly, my character happens to fall in love with a gay cis male. Would you, or have you ever, tried to accommodate someone‚Äôs sexual orientation by diminishing your own identity? I know this is not healthy, but unfortunately my character struggles with their identity and i‚Äôm not sure how realistic it would be if they tried to dress/look more manly around their crush because they assume that‚Äôs the only way he can fall in love with them.

I came out as genderfluid about a year ago, but I've always felt like it wasn't quite right. Like I know I'm nonbinary but genderfluid isn't it.

I was talking to my friend and I realized how I feel and I don't know if there's a word for it and I would really like to know if I'm alone in this so

I pretty much feel like the opposite of agender? Like, I don't flow between the genders, I feel like I am all of them, all the time.  I've struggled with my femininity, and I've struggled with my masculinity, and when I found out I could be bigender it changed my fucking life. Like, I didn't have to choose, and I could express myself however I wanted. But bigender is like, the two extremes. I feel like all the different shades on the spectrum are also me! And it doesn't change daily, like I prefer to roll my pronouns...

So: Is there a word to represent bigender, but that includes the whole spectrum? Genderfluid implies I move along the spectrum, and I don't. I feel like all of the grey areas, all the time.

First of all, I'm a transmasc enby AFAB, and although I'd like to have top surgery and T, I'm still pre everything. The thing is, I have a crush in a guy who live in the same building that me basically since I got here, almost 9 months ago, but always ignored it because he was gay, and I thought he wouldn't find my body attractive.

He lives with a transfem enby who happens to be my friend, and we recently began to talk a bit cause I visited her a lot. A few days ago, they decided to buy MD (drug, found in ecstasy), and asked if I wanted to join. I did, we took it, and had the most deep conversation I had ever manage to have with someone I barely knew. I even asked him if my body was a problem to him in the sexual way. The thing is... He said it wasn't, and I was completely shocked. We talked a lot more, and since then I think I might be in love with him.

The now problem is: things seem stuck. We spend time together, we watch TV series, we talk, we listen to music, but nothing really happens. I just gave him a necklace I made for him, which he said he loved, we were alone, and nothing. I don't know if he expects me to make the first move or what, I don't know what or how to do it, since I freeze when he's around, it's like I can't think straight (cause it's gay, ha ha) 

I'm planning on trying to kiss him tomorrow. My friend (who has already had a thing with him, but it didn't go forward) said to just go ahead and kiss him, but it's not my style, I always ask first.

I'm nonbinary. I like being nonbinary. As far as I'm aware I don't have a conscious desire to change my body - and I'm not sure I'd want to. I've heard from trans women oestrogen brought them more in touch with their emotions (&amp; from trans men they felt their emotions less intensely) and I really like feeling my emotions intensely. Also I don't get physical dysphoria I think - fairly sure I got gender euphoria when I started my period.

I don't wanna change my body in order to ""switch"" genders I think?? Like, I don't wanna start presenting as male. I don't think I want a penis. I think I like my breasts.

I just wish my body was that little bit more masculine. I don't want facial hair. I don't want a deeper voice. I just want lower body fat percentage, slightly harsher skin, maybe to be a bit skinnier &amp; have more muscle (tbf that's not just about gender though).

In terms of my gender presentation though - I just resent the types available for me as an AFAB!!!

At the moment, if I present feminine, I want it to feel like drag. I wanna be from an androgynous / more masculine (but not completely masculine) starting point, and then to look like a non-female dressed up in a female role.

But if I dress up as female people just gender me as female.

OTOH, when I dress genderqueer, I wanna look like JVN !!! I'm really not about the ""short hair, tuxedo and glasses"" andro style but it seems like the only option available as an AFAB.

When I started writing this post I thought it was maybe gender dysphoria (like maybe I want a masculine body), but honestly, I think it's more of a personality thing. I was to look ""loud"" and androgynous at the same time. I want to look slutty, I want to look bold, I want to sexualize my body and feel bold/confident - but I feel like this is (wrongly) associated with femininity.

I wanna look androgynous, feminine, and genderqueer at the same time - but I'm AFAB. I don't wanna look masculine:( But I really don't wanna look female or like a woman either:((((

2020-04-05 10:14:32,fvblsu,0,1,"Hello my wonderful community!   
As many of you, I‚Äòve been struggling with my gender all my life. I always wanted to be masculine, but I didn‚Äôt have the words to say it. Around six months ago, I  realized that my problem was not that I was not like other girls, but that I wasn‚Äôt like other boys. Since then I gained confidence in labelling as Nonbinary and expressing my masculine sides. I‚Äôve started to bind and work out and I‚Äôm dreaming of changing my names or pronouns. Sadly, as I live in Germany, there are no gender neutral pronouns, there‚Äôs almost no Nonbinary culture in general.

I have several friends that are completing their journey of transitioning right now. They‚Äôve had therapy, taken hormones, undergone surgery, the whole thing. But I feel like doing a whole transition to male isn‚Äôt right for me. I dont want the side effect of hormones, I‚Äôm in a very stressful phase at university and can‚Äôt handle going through second puberty right now. Also, I don‚Äôt want to be dependent on them my whole life. 

Another important factor is that I really want kids and don‚Äôt want to make this more complicated than it already is as a lesbian.

 I feel like I‚Äôm stuck. Dysphoria has really gotten to me, I can‚Äôt take looking into the mirror. Last night I finally had a long talk to myself to think about things I like about my female body. That‚Äôs why I made this post - it may help some of you asking the same questions. It needed to be things that are about my body, not my gender. You will not find ‚ÄûI like being able to wear pink dresses‚Äú on my list because I don‚Äôt and because it‚Äôs societys bullshit.

1. I like my muscles, my eyes and my curls. But those aren‚Äôt female things, I would also have and love them if I was AMAB.

2. I like the balance my menstrual cycle brings. It‚Äôs really reliable that my skin is clearest around the first and my mood starts to swing around the 7th of each month. I like how everything comes back in circles and that I can predict that bad mood will leave eventually. I try to think about that when I look at my chest.

I'm AFAB, and have generally been presenting as what most would categorize as ""nerdy tomboy"" for the majority of my adult life so far.

Is that because of how I've been socialized? Because I'm used to putting myself into my AGAB box? Because being a trans-man would be the end of my long term relationship (partner is a straight man)?

It's not like I feel entirely comfortable with my  ""equipment"" but I also go back and forth at the thought of having opposite top and bottom anatomy (current top is moreso an inconvenience, I just don't really feel connected to it but not repulsed by it as I either bind or just go braless. I do NOT like to emphasize it though. Bottom-swapping is sometimes an interesting idea like ""that might be neat"" but other times it's like ""errr, no, no thanks, I'll just pass"").

*but also in the end there is acceptance

The first time I tried to come out as NB was in December of 2017, I was a freshman in college and back home for winter break when I decided to open up to my boyfriend at the time (now an ex). At the time I didn‚Äôt want to use any pronouns, I just wanted to use my name because I wasn‚Äôt sure what felt right and he didn‚Äôt feel like he could do that. My boyfriend was awful, he refused completely and didn‚Äôt want me to be so ‚Äúgay‚Äù, my relationship with this man was insanely abusive and he was very manipulative. He refused to use just my name and refused to use the name I wanted which is actually my real name. Most people call me ‚ÄúGabbie‚Äù when I want to be called Gabrielle, my full name, because it feels much more right. But he ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt have enough time in the day to always say my full name‚Äù it was too much of burden. He also threatened to leave me if I kept being so dramatic and ‚Äúqueer‚Äù (in hindsight I should have let him leave). At this point I was already out as bisexual and the only reason he was okay with that is because he wanted us to sleep with other woman. After a year of being with him we finally broke up and I finally got out, I was free, but I didn‚Äôt feel right coming out again, I had just made new friends at college and didn‚Äôt want them to not accept me considering I had spent a year being isolated by my ex. 

I met my now boyfriend, through this new friend group an we‚Äôve been best friend for over a year, we started dating about 4 months ago and I came out to him about a month ago, I was so scared but it felt like something I just could hide any longer. He has been so accepting and supportive. He calls me by the right name (as he has always done), he has been using gender-neutral terms, using they/them pronouns, and he helped me measure for my binder. He‚Äôs also been so supportive of me coming out to my close friends in our friend group who have all been very supportive. The other day I was feeling really guilty for not being just being a woman (I‚Äôm AFAB) and I messaged him because I was upset and he was just so comforting, understanding, willing to listen to how I was feeling, and validating me completely. He explained to me that it‚Äôs okay that I was feeling this way and that no matter my identity and expression he supports me. He‚Äôs happy that I‚Äôm exploring myself and getting more comfortable being my true self and that all he wants is for me to be happy and to remember that things are different now, him and our friends will support me no matter what.

I came out as non binary about 3 weeks ago and it has been a fucking rollercoaster since. Due to the lockdown because of that fucking virus (massive ups to any medical worker reading this, you guys rock), I haven't been able to see any of my friends that actually accept me and use my correct pronouns. My whole family doesn't use my pronouns, despite me literally telling them and correcting them every time they misgender me, only to be met with mocking and excuses like ""oh I've known you for so long that I'm so used to using he"". Fuck you, dad (actually my mum but to get back at him I'm misgendering him until he fucking figures out they/them pronouns).

I really want to see a gender therapist about starting HRT and figuring out my identity, but I'm not sure in even trans??? Like I really enjoy thinking about having tits and looking more feminine but idk if it's just a sexual thing or not??

Yes, I have a sissy fetish. Hi r/itsafetish btw. It's not to the point where it affects my daily life, but I do think it could play a part in the way I feel. I don't experience any dysphoria as well, but when I put mascara and a choker on I feel way cuter than if I just dress cis, and 95% of the happiness I feel is not sexual, more just excited about how cute I look.

Also, my work, which is still open, doesn't let me have nails. That would be understandable, except for the fact that all the girls always have fake nails? And yet someone who is viewed as a cis male isn't even allowed fucking black nail polish?? I would be fine with it, but my nails are really helping me look more feminine for the meantime until I potentially start hrt.

The Department of Linguistics at University of Delaware is conducting a study on perception of gender of synthetic voices. If you would like to participate, please continue with the survey. Participating is voluntary. You may stop at any time. All responses are anonymous. You must be a native speaker of American English. 
 
If you participate, you will first answer some demographic questions and questions about your gender identity, then you will listen to various synthetically made voices and rate their perceived femininity, masculinity, and ""something other than femininity or masculinity"". These voices are best listened to over a pair of headphones.

Aunt Flo

The crimson wave

The shining

However you refer to it. Having a period every month can cause immense dysphoria, on top of physical discomfort and pain. But I've found that not a lot of cis women openly discuss periods, let alone nb individuals. Now, this is largely due to the stigma that periods are gross, uncleen, etc. But I digress.

Here, I'm going to be discussing a combination of personal experience as well as giving resources. Please note I am NOT affiliated with any of these brands.

**1) Naming your period.**

This may sound absolutely ridiculous, but it can be a lot of fun. I actually started doing this when my therapist told me that giving my PTSD and anxiety a name can make them seem less intimidating (I named the ptsd/anxiety Kevin. Fuckin Kevin). I wound up calling my period Igor, after a character in one of my favorite comedy sketches. You can also use neutral names, and you don't even have to give it a human name. I have a friend who refers to her period as ""Pennywise"" even.

**2) Products make a difference**

Despite presenting as somewhat fem, I find having to carry around pads and tampons to really am up the dysphoria. Instead, I switched to a Diva Cup. Some of you are going to be wondering ""wait, how does that help? You still have to fish around in something that doesn't match your gender"". Well, it's discreet. No bulky packaging that sounds like a bag of chips, no pad outlines through pants, and no tampon strings hanging out of shorts. Additionally, it lasts up to 12 hours depending on your flow, so I don't even have to run into a bathroom to change it.

If you do decide to use pads and tampons, packaging can make you feel a lot better. Brands like Cora have pretty minimal packaging, and aren't covered in flowers and butterflies. 

Lastly, period undergarments. Brands like Thinx and TomboyX have created period-proof underwear, ranging in all shapes and sizes, from thongs to boxers and trunks. These undergarments are created with an absorbent pad built-in, or an insertable pad. These have been popular among the FTM community for some time, however I think anyone of any identity can benefit from them.

**3) Period control**

Some medications can affect your period. Personally, I use birth control as a means of cycle control since it was so bad I was missing work and class. Some forms of birth control can virtually stop your periods. However, it is important to discuss all options with your doctor to determine if this is an option for you.

**Some triggers to look for involving disordered eating and sexual assault coming up. **

***


For a long time, I used to enjoy wearing bras that made my chest look smaller. I've always struggled a bit with having a feminine figure, and while I've enjoyed dressing up at times or emphasizing how I look, I've always had this sensation of wanting so desperately to be traditionally feminine and pretty, but hating to be looked at and noticed for it. I went through phases of wanting to have a flat chest or just feeling physically uncomfortable with both my bottom and top, but I've been through some pretty rough sexual assault/abuse experiences so I always put it down to not wanting the parts of me that had felt ""damaged"". I also had an eating disorder and thought some of it was dysmorphia.

I stopped experiencing this for a couple years as I dug myself out of depression, the ED became milder, and I started dating men. I had some occasional awful days every few months where I would feel the bottom and top dysphoria and desire to not be looked at or look feminine, but overall, I was happy wearing traditionally feminine/sexy clothing. 

However, after starting to untangle some of the abuse I went through, not being in a committed relationship with a man for the first time in a while, and relapsing with my eating habits, I feel it all again, so much more intensely this time. I hate my femininity. I don't want to have a feminine body. Looking in mirrors and seeing tits and a vagina is really displeasing to me. But I also don't see myself identifying with masculinity. I don't know if this is gender dysphoria or trauma I'm working through, and I don't want to minimize the experience of anyone going through one or another or say any one thing caused this feeling. But I don't know what I'm feeling now, and I don't know who I am, and I'm living with my extremely conservative family right now where I'm not free to open up to anyone about these feelings without ending up on the streets. I'm not sure if I don't actually feel dysphoric, or if I try to explain away the dysphoria with other things because I'm scared of the possibility that I might not be cis. 


**Tl;dr I don't know if I (a cis female as far as I know) am struggling with dysphoria or the combined effects of an eating disorder, sexual violence, and living in a world that hates women.

I've always felt like I was a boy, but at times I'm happy as a girl, and I never understood these feelings until I found out about the LGBTQ+ community back in my middle school years. I thought I was trans then, because I usually feel like a boy, but when I'm nearing my period and during it (I have a regular cycle of getting it only a few times a year), I feel comfortable and happy as a girl, but otherwise, I feel dysphoria about my entire body and as a result, I have tendencies to SH. But then later, I realized I was actually genderfluid and now, I know I'm bigender. But back to the topic:

I've told my girlfriend near the beginning of our relationship about how I felt like a boy a lot of times and how I freak out sometimes and have panic attacks because of this. I talked to her about the trans community last year, and the dicussion did not go very well. I understand that she doesn't quite understand it, and she has her own thoughts, but she's told me things like, ""They're just looking for attention"", ""Fake genders?"", ""I don't know if I'll love you the same if you transition""

But trust me,,, she's not transphobic,, or so she says. She's so open minded about e v e r y t h i n g, but it hurts me when she says all this crap about the trans and nb community.

She's the person who I always go to, but I feel like I can never truly be myself around her because of this, and it hurts me how if close-minded she is on this topic,,, She's admitted to me how she knows she's ignorant about it, but she ""just can't understand why and how people feel that way"".

I just feel so alone, because she's my best friend, too. And I know that she won't accept me, not now anyways.

2020-04-08 13:33:47,fx6jxk,0,1,"While I have been questioning my gender identity for quite some time, and sometimes I have wondered whether I am MtF transgender, after some long consideration, I feel that a non-binary gender identity fits me much better than does an MtF identity.  The rigidity of masculine gender expression, I believe, led me into believing that I was MtF rather than non-binary.  


Throughout this time, however, I have stressed over the dilemma of professional attire that is usually described in binary terms.  As an AMAB individual I am highly aware that my options are much more limited (that is, without coming out as non-binary or MtF) than someone who is AFAB.  Stressing over this matter, I feel, is keeping me from even applying to more professional jobs and holding back my career potential.  Ideally I would wear a suit and collared dress shirt as this combination is basically gender-neutral (acceptable to men and women when professional attire is described in binary terms), but if I am perceived as male (which will happen), then business professional norms require wearing a tie, and this keeps the outfit from being gender-neutral.  My career advisor also stated that business professional attire is usually the norm in most professional interview settings (though if you get the job attire can be more casual), and I am extremely stressed out by this.  


I am also thinking of ways that I could move a professional outfit away from an aggressively-masculine look while holding as closely as possible to male professional attire norms.  Some things I have thought of involve buying women's shirts and suits that resemble those seen in men's stores, and perhaps experimenting a bit more with fabrics (particularly shirt fabrics) and patterns.  I have asked about this a few times on r/asktransgender and while I have received some positive responses, many think that this will be perceived negatively.  I would like to have some of the options available to women but I realize that as long as I am perceived as male it may be seen as unprofessional (I just don't get why feminine = unprofessional, especially considering that this leads to the degrading and objectification of women), but I could easily settle for a few of these options (shirt fabrics/patterns, differently-shaped collars, etc.) that do not involve wearing skirts or dresses.  


And FYI: I do not care about things like button placements and the sort.  They seem like such a minor detail in the whole scheme of things, even though the buttons might make it noticeable that I am wearing women's clothes.  Eventually I do plan to come out, but only after I know the company I work for is accepting (and once this happens I might be able to expand my clothing options somewhat, and if they are not understanding of non-binary identities, but are understanding of binary transgender identities, I plan to fall back on the MtF description).",NonBinary,AMAB non-binary and professional attire,1586378027.0,"{'created_utc': 1586352827, 'id': 'fx6jxk', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""While I have been questioning my gender identity for quite some time, and sometimes I have wondered whether I am MtF transgender, after some long consideration, I feel that a non-binary gender identity fits me much better than does an MtF identity.

I have asked about this a few times on [r/asktransgender](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/)  and while I have received some positive responses, many think that this  will be perceived negatively if it is obvious that I am wearing women's clothes; I know from these previous discussions that jacket lengths on  women's suits are shorter than on men's suits, although there are women's suits with longer jacket lengths (the only issue would be a lack  of pockets I guess, but perhaps I could use a briefcase like a handbag  if people carry around briefcases often).  I would like to have some of  the options available to women but I realize that as long as I am perceived as male it may be seen as unprofessional (I just don't get why  feminine = unprofessional, especially considering that this leads to the degrading and objectification of women in the workplace), but I could easily settle for a few of these options (shirt fabrics/patterns,  differently-shaped collars, etc.) that do not involve wearing skirts or  dresses.

The rigidity of masculine gender  expression, I believe, led me into believing that I was MtF rather than  non-binary.\n\nThroughout this time, however, I have stressed over the dilemma of professional attire that is  usually described in binary terms.  As an AMAB individual I am highly  aware that my options are much more limited (that is, without coming out  as non-binary or MtF) than someone who is AFAB.  Stressing over this  matter, I feel, is keeping me from even applying to more professional jobs and holding back my career potential.  Ideally I would wear a suit and collared dress shirt as this combination is basically gender-neutral (acceptable to men and women when professional attire is described in  binary terms), but if I am perceived as male (which will happen), then business professional norms require wearing a tie, and this keeps the outfit from being gender-neutral.  My career advisor also stated that  business professional attire is usually the norm in most professional  interview settings (though if you get the job attire can be more  casual), and I am extremely stressed out by this.\n\nI  am also thinking of ways that I could move a professional outfit away from an aggressively-masculine look while holding as closely as possible  to male professional attire norms.

Like if you asked me my favorite color and I said blue you generally understand what I mean and you could probably follow me if I said specifically sky blue. But the truth is that sky blue encompasses so many different types of blue still and with in that range if I saw it I could pin point the exact blue I‚Äôm talking about and as a person with design experience tell you more specifically I like a tone between cerulean blue and teal with an opacity of about 55 to 70% and the brightens and contrast slightly adjust to compensate for possible dullness. And you might not understand exactly what I mean but you would still understand that it was a color. And if I just said blue that I wasn‚Äôt lying. 

Luckily with color I could just show you but gender is much more complicated than that.

2020-04-08 22:44:58,fxgmrc,2,2,"Hey there!
I'm Robin, 24 years old, now 8 days on T and planning top surgery at the end of the year. I'm trans  nonbinary. I want all the changes from T and the top surgery, so we don't have to discuss this. I call myself ftn (n for neutral).
My english isn't great, excuse my mistakes. 

Now my problem:
I came out to my family last year and told them, that I'm nonbinary and changed my name. They asked if I want some changes, and I said no, because it wasn't a thing for me in the past. Over the time, a lot of therapy and getting support, I decided that I really want T and top surgery, I just said no in the past because I was scared of the reactions. And still I am.
I don't really know how I tell my family my decisions. I'm really really scared. 
Most of them calling me by my new name, but not all of them. My boyfriend and me will get married next year, so we plan the day, write a guestlist, etc. I'm thinking about not inviting the people, who don't respect my identity until then and still call me by my old name. I tried to talk about this with my mum and sister, but they said, that it's my fault, when I feeling upset about get called by the old name. So there are not supportive and I'm lost at this moment. 
The first changes on T will come within the next weeks and month and I'm getting nervous.. Should I wait, 'til they ask me? Should I tell them about it? 
It's my body, my life, my decision. I can't withstand any more discussions about that and I think, These discussion will come when I tell them about T (and surgery). 
At least I' m afraid that they don't understand that I'm not a boy. I know, it would be easier to explain it this way, but it's not who I am.. 

I hope, you understand me and maybe can help me.

I apologize for this clunky wall of text, there's a TL;DR at the bottom, but it's currently 3am and I'm just trying to get this off my mind. Relevant info I guess I'm in my 20's and only started exploring these things a few years ago around age 17/18. I'm also in a long-term established relationship with a partner who is perfectly happy to support me through all of this, but isn't knowledgeable on the subject themselves so they are unable to give me advice. This has the Ask flair but I'm not sure if Support is better, sorry if it's not quite right.   


For reference, I am AMAB. Growing up I always had a deep desire to explore the other side of the coin, so to speak. I often attributed it to being the only XY child produced out of 5, growing up in a household of nothing but feminine figures and my father probably influenced me a lot. But as I grew older and started being more confident in who I was, I noticed two things. The feelings never went away; that curiosity was still there. But conversely, I was still comfortable with who I am.   


After talking to a close friend for a while about my precise feelings, they implored me to look into the Enby side of things instead of looking at is as more linear. I hadn't had much experience at this point but after doing my homework, Genderfluid seemed to fit the most. So I explored that, and for around 2 years now I've been using that term to apply to myself. I felt safe enough in online spaces to explore using feminine and neutral pronouns too, and for the most part I prefer She/Her to the He/Him I was used to.   


But it's never felt quite right. I'm sure there's a term for it, but I've never felt... unhappy? I've never really experienced any kind of dysphoria. I'm comfortable with the body I have, and it doesn't really hurt my feelings to still be called he/him, though I've come to dislike associating those terms with myself too much. I'm still extremely curious about the feminine side of things, and if I could have a chance to experience things from that perspective I would, but I don't want it to be permanent. I'm scared of being wrong. I never experienced dysphoria, I never truly felt like ""she/her"" was right, even though it felt the best. After 2 years of trying, I've felt more and more like an imposter and I don't know why. I don't think I'm trans, genderfluid still matches how I feel the best, but lately it's just been sitting wrong on my shoulders and I haven't been able to place it.   


I guess this is kind of a vent, but mostly I wanted advice. Has anyone else experienced this? Is there some experience I'm lacking that might help? I feel like it's somehow wrong to want these experiences and ask people to use she/her when I'm still comfortable with a masculine life; I'm not in any form of transition and I live in the Deep South of the US so I can't really go around trying on feminine clothing. Even my own father doesn't know about any of this.   


TL;DR I'm AMAB and feel like I'm genderfluid but I feel wrong asking people to use She/Her sometimes because it feels like I'm an imposter or I subconsciously worry that I'm somehow faking it.

2020-04-10 14:09:09,fyggfy,7,1,"I'm an asexual person (and maybe arromantic too) and I never truly cared about romantic relationships (even less sexual relationships), but lately I caught myself wondering about them.

I'm also assigned female at birth (I don't know my gender yet, but she/them pronouns are okay) but when I see a picture of a cute girl and then I see she's a lesbian I always think ""aw shoot, they wouldn't like me"" and I'm like... ""... wait""

BUT sometimes I dream about having a relationship with some of my friends and I don't feel that weird thinking I'm a woman, I even think ""I would be a woman in a relationship with a woman! That rocks!"" or ""I'm a woman in a relationship with a man!"" (In this last case I like to think I'm the top).

2020-04-11 05:52:48,fyxkn2,4,1,"dear dad, 
you‚Äôre probably confused by what that word means. defined, by the merriam-webster dictionary, in the sense that i mean it, it means, ‚Äúrelating to or being a person who identifies with or expresses a gender identity that is neither entirely male nor entirely female.‚Äù This means that while my sex (defined by chromosomes) is biologically female, it is not the same as my gender (defined by an individual‚Äôs brain). These are feelings i‚Äôve been having for a while, and have been dealing with for years. I remember first feeling different when i started noticing that i was physically growing up. As i went through puberty, i gradually felt less and less like myself. originally, i attributed it to being a chubby kid. But even after i lost weight, i realized i still hated my body. I‚Äôd always compare myself to others, specifically to those who‚Äôs gender seemed uncertain just by looking at them.

2020-04-12 00:34:19,fzmkn4,0,1,"So first off, I'm pretty new to a lot of gender stuff, I've been kinda transphobic for pretty much my whole life up to around two weeks ago. Once I realized the error of my ways, I started to cope with the fact that I've had thoughts on and off of ""I should be a woman"" for the past 10 years or so (I'm 17 and AMAB btw). I've been really thinking about it lately and I don't know if I'm agender or genderfluid. Lately I haven't been thinking specifically ""I should be a woman"" but that's what I recall going through my mind a lot when I was younger. Growing up my stepfather drilled it into me that I needed to be more manly and that I wasn't man enough, and then in middle school I was bullied because once I did something even remotely feminine I was called gay. This lead to me forcing myself to act as masculine as I possibly could and now I realize I don't have to anymore. I came out as bi/pan last summer, and it felt really good. Now, when I think about how I feel about myself the best thing that I come up with is ""I don't feel like a man, nor do I feel like a woman, I feel like a person."" But then at the same time when I look in the mirror I wish that I had a less masculine chin and I wish that I was more curvy and I hate having hair on my face and legs and it felt really good when I shaved it all off recently and like, I don't hate my body nor do I love it. Another thing, is that I would like breasts. I have memories of me at a young age stuffing my shirts when no one was around to make it look like I have breasts and I liked the feeling of it. I want to try feminine clothes and I don't have a problem with being feminine anymore but I don't feel like a woman. I also don't hate my genitals, I don't have a problem with looking down and seeing a penis there. A question that comes up when I've been researching stuff is ""if one day you woke up as the opposite sex how would you feel?"" I've wondered this to myself over time lately and the answer varies. If I could pick *anything* for what I have down there, it would be to be able to either switch inbetween the two or to have both at the same time. With neither being possible, I choose to keep what I've got 'cause I want to have kids someday. 

Also, I've taken around 5-6 or so different gender identity quizzes (and yes, I know, online quizzes are not very accurate) and I've gotten a mix between agender/gender-neutral and genderfluid. I've looked at what it means to be both and sometimes it's like, yeah I feel like this one but then at another time it's the other. I've thought about just feeling the feels and experimenting but now's not really a good time to do that seeing as I don't have crippling dysphoria and I'm comfortable with what I have at home, but I still want to talk to people and see other opinions and have that help me as well.

Once I realized the error of my ways, I started to cope with the fact that I\'ve had thoughts on and off of ""I should be a woman"" for the past 10 years or so (I\'m 17 and AMAB btw). I\'ve been really thinking about it lately and I don\'t know if I\'m agender or genderfluid. Lately I haven\'t been thinking specifically ""I should be a woman"" but that\'s what I recall going through my mind a lot when I was younger. Growing up my stepfather drilled it into me that I needed to be more manly and that I wasn\'t man enough, and then in middle school I was bullied because once I did something even remotely feminine I was called gay. This lead to me forcing myself to act as masculine as I possibly could and now I realize I don\'t have to anymore. I came out as bi/pan last summer, and it felt really good. Now, when I think about how I feel about myself the best thing that I come up with is ""I don\'t feel like a man, nor do I feel like a woman, I feel like a person."" But then at the same time when I look in the mirror I wish that I had a less masculine chin and I wish that I was more curvy and I hate having hair on my face and legs and it felt really good when I shaved it all off recently and like, I don\'t hate my body nor do I love it. Another thing, is that I would like breasts. I have memories of me at a young age stuffing my shirts when no one was around to make it look like I have breasts and I liked the feeling of it. I want to try feminine clothes and I don\'t have a problem with being feminine anymore but I don\'t feel like a woman. I also don\'t hate my genitals, I don\'t have a problem with looking down and seeing a penis there.

2020-04-13 10:30:09,g0geri,9,2,"Crossposted from r/genderfluid with some additional notes.

So I was pretty sure I'm genderfluid, however...

A lot of times people describe their gender fluidity as what sounds like a switch being turned off and on. I see this example a lot ""I'll wake up in the morning as a woman, put on a cute outfit, walk out the door and suddenly I'm uncomfortable cause I'm a man in a skirt.""

For me, I've never felt like that. When it comes to the idea of gender (and I admit I absolutely have fragmented and damaged pieces of my psyche that might contribute to that), I can't ever really firmly say ""I feel like a man"" or ""I feel like a woman"" or ""I feel like A or B.""

I feel like... I'm me. That's all I can describe it as.

I have times where I absolutely present as a woman and think in a way as a woman in terms of social, sexual, clothing and other avenues. There are other times where I feel masculine, and start thinking in different ways, in terms of social, sexual etc.

I never learned any of those hard lines of demarcation in terms of expression. I can't use makeup past extremely elementary basics. Because of a physical condition I do sprout longer hairs on the underside of my neck and sometimes I let these grow out just because it makes me more comfortable when my masculine side gets more prevalent.

But I don't know if that's the literal term of genderfluid, or if I'm just something else that enjoys wearing men and women's clothing. I thought I had an identity but I don't feel like so many other people describe it as so, call it a mild identity crisis.

If I'm not GF, any idea what I could be?

I see this example a lot ""I\'ll wake up in the morning as a woman, put on a cute outfit, walk out the door and suddenly I\'m uncomfortable cause I\'m a man in a skirt.""\n\nFor me, I\'ve never felt like that. When it comes to the idea of gender (and I admit I absolutely have fragmented and damaged pieces of my psyche that might contribute to that), I can\'t ever really firmly say ""I feel like a man"" or ""I feel like a woman"" or ""I feel like A or B.""\n\nI feel like... I\'m me. That\'s all I can describe it as.\n\nI have times where I absolutely present as a woman and think in a way as a woman in terms of social, sexual, clothing and other avenues. There are other times where I feel masculine, and start thinking in different ways, in terms of social, sexual etc.\n\nI never learned any of those hard lines of demarcation in terms of expression. I can\'t use makeup past extremely elementary basics. Because of a physical condition I do sprout longer hairs on the underside of my neck and sometimes I let these grow out just because it makes me more comfortable when my masculine side gets more prevalent.\n\nBut I don\'t know if that\'s the literal term of genderfluid, or if I\'m just something else that enjoys wearing men and women\'s clothing. I thought I had an identity but I don\'t feel like so many other people describe it as so, call it a mild identity crisis.\n\nIf I\'m not GF, any idea what I could be?\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this.\n\nEdit for NB and GQ subreddits: I was given the idea of possibly being agender from my original post.

2020-04-13 19:21:22,g0ppeg,6,17,"Hey y‚Äôall! I‚Äôm here to talk about something that gets overlooked: BODY MODS!!

Now, I love body mods. I‚Äôm just starting out, and I‚Äôm 7 piercings and 5 tattoos. Body‚Äôs mods are cool, trendy, personal, but they can also help with dysphoria. 

Some people get traditionally feminine motifs to help them feel feminine. Some masculine motifs. But most of all, tattoos and piercings can be gender less. They ARE genderless. 

AND THATS WHAT MAKES THEM GOOD FOR DYSPHORIA! at least in my own experience. 

It‚Äôs a cool way to alter yourself body in a way to make you more comfortable in your skin. I have some tattoos to hide scars, some to remind me of my faith, and some just for shits and giggles.

My issue is that my partner does not like my hair buzzed. Of course, he and I both know it‚Äôs my hair and I can ultimately do what I want. I‚Äôm not sure if the issue is our relationship has been a bit strained (due largely to my mental health issues which now are thankfully well managed since I got a proper diagnosis).

Or maybe I‚Äôm feeling nervous because when I buzzed my hair before I wasn‚Äôt confused about my gender identity. I ordered a binder recently (hasn‚Äôt come yet!) and feel pretty dumb. Like I can‚Äôt even cut my hair but think I‚Äôll be cool binding? I wonder if I am more nervous about the whole gender identity situation rather than the hair itself.

I know I feel more confident with my hair buzzed, which will ultimately make my anxiety and depression better since for some reason I am obsessing over this. I just am a people pleaser to the extreme and am very concerned that my partner and best friend think I look silly with buzzed hair.

Every year, O4U hosts a weekend-long professional development conference for high achieving, high potential LGBTQ+ undergraduate students who are studying engineering or interested in going into engineering. If you're not familiar with Out for Undergrad (O4U) or the O4U Engineering Conference, you can learn more about it on the website here: [https://www.outforundergrad.org/](https://www.outforundergrad.org/?fbclid=IwAR0VN_LN7V5Dsy-TF85ou45TkMXBI5mGns1aPZNomh-XjBTgNs8V-C1tbYs).

I attended O4U for the first time in 2016, and can quite honestly say it changed my entire life and career path. Without this conference space, I likely would have switched out of my major, missed out on an amazing full-time job after school, and taken much longer to figure out my identity (if at all). O4U has also given me a huge network of queer friends all over the place who I would never have met otherwise.

We understand that students are going through many transitions at this time. To ensure that we continue to recruit the most diverse and high achieving LGBTQ+ undergraduate student candidates, we're reaching out via as many chanels as possible. The student application deadlines are being extended from our previously announced dates. O4U is an amazing opportunity for students to meet recruiters from a variety of engineering firms and universities. To keep the conference accessible for all students, **flights and hotels are covered entirely by O4U**. This means that if students are admitted from your college/university, they will only have to pay the $90 registration fee. We also work with students‚Äô financial needs to make sure that if they are admitted to the conference, they are able to attend.

This year‚Äôs O4U Engineering Conference will be held in Minneapolis, Minnesota, from September 11-13th. The application deadline for round two admissions is currently May 10th, 2020, at 11:59 PM (EST).

I hope this info is helpful!

2020-04-14 00:44:17,g0vgt7,2,12,"Hi friends,

Felt like writing a post because the gender questioning has gotten a bit consuming mentally and thought I‚Äôd see if anyone can relate.

I'm AMAB, and as a young kid definitely remember wanting to do all the girly stuff. Makeup, nails, girls toys, mom's shoes, costume jewelry, etc. Was probably over the top more than most girls even ha. Was definitely like a baby drag queen in that way for lack of a better word. My dad made sure to shame the crap out of me. And after such an incident I remember staring in mirror wishing I was a girl. In elementary school definitely recognized myself as a boy but hated boy drag (like halloween, hated having to pick costumes from boy section), but always liked to play with other boys rather than girls. Loved my boy pack of friends. Actually just remember feeling somewhat different from the boys and girls since I liked hanging out with both. 

Puberty didn't hit me too hard, I remember it being a little weird but I also remember enjoying developing a manly chest, happy trail. When started to feel tingly down there definitely for boys. Watched a bit of straight porn, but always looked at guys, so started watching gay porn, reading gay erotica which was way more of a turn on. Even sometimes turned on by my boy self in the mirror.

Really butched-it-up in high school/college and became someone I'm not just to survive and fit in after dollying that hit in 9th grade really destroyed a more authentic version of me. Came out as gay at 22 and have lived a pretty fulfilling gay life. Multiple boyfriends (new one is amazing!), friends, enjoy the hilarity, play and the ""gender"" of being a gay man--for better or for worse our society doesn't view gay men as ""real men"" as Kate Bornstein would say. The biggest insult to me was always when people would say things like ""you don't seem gay"" or ""you seem normal."" I realize now that was more because I didn't feel like a normal guy at all (and some gay men definitely do!)

Flash forward to now (30's) and have built up the confidence not to run and to try to be my most authentic self and wanna put myself back together. Which I congratulate you all on working towards because its a real act of self-love. But really hard to untangle feelings, desires, previous stigmas and shame. There is a part of me that feels like super-duper gay boy: I'm super jealous of the young gay femmes on tiktok with their make up tutorials, crop-tops, lil Twink bodies, etc. But there is a part of me that feels more female than just a male that likes feminine things. At the same time, usually fluctuate between ok with an liking my body (which fortunately is a pretty well built but not overly hairless masculine body).  I also realized I spend way more time looking at f--&gt;nb or f--&gt;m bois than anything else and love that aesthetic. Sometimes I feel like a drag king who is doing a good job (which it doesn't hurt that many people have said I looked androgynous and questioned whether I was ftm based on my facial structure in the past). And I kinda like that male drag. Where when I look at m--&gt;f transitions not a lot resonates (but is this just externalizing transphobia since I'm amab?).

So I've come to understand some things about me:

1) I'm some form of trans

2) Enby really resonates with my gender philosophy and I love the more nb masc asthetic

3) Still have some connection to gay male culture

4) Still have memories of really wanting to be female that don't seem to integrate well

5) Much harder to integrate nb into my life as a professional in their 30s. Almost wish I was mtf but when I think about ""what I want"" if I woke up tomorrow with a woman's body I feel like I'd say wtf

6) Gender is f-ing weird and understanding that it's not always static is somewhat helpful to me (both fluid in time and changing through your life)

Still working through all this, but any insights could be helpful. Just looking for some inner peace and seems hard to find. Some of it feels like I swing between the binary poles because I haven't fully accepted the gender spectrum without shame. Thanks for reading!

So I've been going over my gender identity over the past few days, again, after the final prospect of getting to go on HRT in my life. For the record I'm male, body wise, since that's probably an important factor going in. I'm just questioning if there are other people like me here and what you identify as, and maybe how you came around?

I thought I was just neutral on gender for a while, in regards to myself, and I really don't have any preference for pronouns at all. I do realize I hate being always considered a man no matter what, and hate how masculine my body looks. After a lot of looking inward I realized my ideal body is (probably) possible, I just haven't ever met anyone feeling the same thing

I want to look androgynous, is probably the best terms. I always wear comfy clothes to me so those are fairly neutral looking on their own. I love the idea of being able to have boobs, but wear a binder some days when I'm not feeling them. I want to look cute, but almost tomboyish in a way. I still would like my downstairs area to function (which I know is possible on HRT). I'd be willing to answer anything else but that's all I can think of atm

I've just never met anyone out there who describes wanting to be like this/look like this. Finding a term for it (or what people like me would call it) would help me do soul-searching but if I knew the term I probably wouldn't be asking here. I've met just about everyone on the spectrum of genders (my line of work makes that easy, along with my new living area) but still, learn new stuff all the time.

As a side note I guess as anyone like this gone on HRT, and what were your experiences like? Would someone have advice on HRT like this?

I felt like a fake for a while, I knew about non binary identities but was sure I was ment to be either a man or a woman, however neither fit right.

My partner is a het man who understands my identity as well as I do- though that isnt much- and accepts me.


I dont experience dyysmorphia the way many people do, and for me it's an equal part euphoria at being perceived as masc/nb as it is dismorphia at looking female to most people.

2020-04-14 14:11:05,g167fb,6,11,"TDLR; why some days I feel comfortable in my skin, love my lady parts, and other days, wish nothing more to have a dick and no boobs ?

I am a 23 yo AFAB enby. 

Background: 

As a young child, I wore boys clothes often and was made fun of for it. I think this is how I became a rather feminine middle schooler and high schooler. My senior year however, I shaved my head and people would call me sir or he/him often‚Äîthis was totally new for me, having been very feminine in the past. I wanted to be a hot girl with a buzz cut, not be perceived as a man... 

Until I started to enjoy being perceived as a man. I never questioned my gender until this time in my life (around the same time I was beginning to realize I liked women) and I began questioning it HARD. I even at one point considered if I was a trans man, which I am not‚Äîbut all I knew is that I didn‚Äôt feel woman most the time, and didn‚Äôt quite feel man either. This is when I heard of non-binary people, which seemed to be the best fit for me. 

Today:

I am an AFAB enby that goes by she/her, enjoys when people use they/them, and is not offended whatsoever to people using he/him. I don‚Äôt shave my legs anymore, don‚Äôt wear much makeup, and my clothes and hair reflect my desire to look androgynous. Pronouns have become meaningless to me, personally‚Äîbut I am mostly viewed as a woman due to my rather large breasts and ass. 

There are times I feel very feminine, sexy, voluptuous‚Äîrunning my hands across my boobs and squeezing them because they are so cool. 

And other times, I don‚Äôt want my boobs at all. And it is during this time that I usually daydream of having a penis.

i right now identify as nonbinary because of these reasons

1. i have a strong hatred for my birth name (not because it's a bad name, it's just so feminine and i don't think it suits me)


2. i get uncomfortable when im referred to with female pronouns


3. i absolutely despise my voice because it's so soft and high pitched


4. i hate my chest and curves. my chest isnt even that big but i still get uncomfortable when i look at it. it doesn't look like it belongs on me and i want it gone


5. i feel extremely disconnected from women and womanhood. when i get paired up with girls in school i don't feel like i belong there, like im not one of them. this also happens when i use women restrooms, i get extremely anxious whenever im in there because i feel like im invading their space. i'm not sure how i would feel in a men's restroom though, ive never been in one


6. i feel most comfortable identifying as nonbinary and knowing i don't have to make myself fit into any gender binaries 


the reason im posting this on reddit is because i cant tell if this is genuine gender dysphoria or if its just symptoms coming from my self hatred and depression. i've never really felt confident about myself, i've always been a shy kid who was never able to make friends. i'm afraid that i only feel these things because i hate myself, and that if i do transition i'll regret it.

2020-04-14 23:38:26,g1gkzf,0,7,"So I want to start this off with a backstory.
I was never a girly person and even though I was a girl I never really felt comfortable being a girl, jeans and shirts are my fave and I never wanted to look girly or even really look like a girl growing up.
I would cry and become incredibly uncomfortable around feminine things like makeup and dresses.
People in my family did try and get me into dresses but it never happened as I hated wearing them.
(Please don‚Äôt hate my family for this as it‚Äôs not something I‚Äôm mad at them for)

I don‚Äôt think I ever really hid this as I never really knew that I was any different as I just figured I was me, and being me was awesome.
When my best friend came out as a trans man I did think I was a trans man for a short while as I didn‚Äôt really wanna be a girl.

That was until the beginning of last year when I REALLY wanted to try a binder and I didn‚Äôt want my boobs anymore, I started wearing baggy clothing and just left it at that.

Around 4 months ago I was at a friends and I put on a dress, it was a biker type dress with pleats (hopefully you know what I mean) and within 1 sec of having it on I burst into tears and tried to tear it off.
We took it off and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever felt so uncomfortable and disgusting in a while.

A couple of months ago I gave it some actual thought, and spoke to some people online and realised I‚Äôm probably not a male or a female and that‚Äôs pretty cool.

I‚Äôm moving house when quarantine is over and will be getting a binder so I can finally be me.

The thing is that I came out to my friends and none of them seemed to care or where shocked as they always knew me as the girl who wasn‚Äôt a girl, my roommate even said he never really saw me as a girl and didn‚Äôt care lol.


TMI....
It also makes sence to me as to why I went through a hyposexual phase for a year and then refused to even touch my downstairs, I actually have to force myself to clean down there cause I hate touching it.

I wasn‚Äôt allowed to get my hair cut as a kid and my long hair gave me so much dysphoria, though at the time I didn‚Äôt realize that‚Äôs what it was. I just thought that I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúgirly‚Äù and that‚Äôs why my hair gave me so much anxiety that I couldn‚Äôt even stand touching it. 

I cut it off in high school. Started researching gender. Realized that I didn‚Äôt really feel like a woman. Thought that must mean I was a trans man, but I quickly dismissed that. I didn‚Äôt feel like a man either.

For a couple years I tried to look like a ‚Äúgirl‚Äù because I thought that I was just bad at it. Makeup, blouses. I looked stupid and felt so uncomfortable and dysphoric. 

 I didn‚Äôt really know any queer people until well after I graduated college. I felt totally alone. 

For a while I just called myself androgynous. That‚Äôs how I looked, that‚Äôs how I dressed. I didn‚Äôt think too hard about it. Almost exactly half of the people I met thought I was a boy and the other half thought I was a girl. 

Eventually I came across the term non-binary and that was the only thing I could really click with. 

I started to accept it and open up about it with some friends. They didn‚Äôt really understand it and I didn‚Äôt know how to explain it to them. How do you explain feeling like ‚Äúsomething else‚Äù to people who have always felt comfortable in their assigned gender?

I started meeting other people who called themselves non-binary. They were all AFAB, except one who also identified as a trans woman. They all presented feminine and all used they/them pronouns. It made me very insecure, even though I know there‚Äôs no one way to be non-binary. But seemingly they were comfortable being feminine, but still identified as NB/trans and used neutral pronouns, whereas I identified as non-binary because I really could not fit into any other box. I wondered if I didn‚Äôt really understand what non-binary meant. I tried to talk to a couple of them about being non-binary, like mentioning some issues I have being NB (being judged in public, being afraid to use restrooms), hoping for solidarity, but they each acted like I didn‚Äôt know what I was talking about. It was very disheartening. 

I felt embarrassed that I still use she/her pronouns. I hate being called she/her, but I hate every other pronoun too. I‚Äôm used to being a she, I know I am definitely not a he, and the idea of being called a they or any other neutral term makes me feel incredibly alienated. I‚Äôm also not out to most people, even though I am obviously not cis.

I dated someone for a while who routinely encouraged me to change to they/them and to let them refer to me as their ‚Äúpartner‚Äù instead of their girlfriend. I had told them how I felt about the pronouns but they still seemed to want me to be ‚Äúmore‚Äù non-binary. And I liked being introduced as a ‚Äúgirlfriend‚Äù because it saved me the embarrassment of having to explain my pronouns to strangers. So that was also disheartening, to feel like I had misinterpreted NB yet again and that I wasn‚Äôt living up to someone‚Äôs expectations. I later realized they were the type to ‚Äúcollect‚Äù queer friends and any time they would mention a queer friend to someone new, they‚Äôd mention that person‚Äôs queerness for no reason. Like, ‚Äúoh, my coworker J.J. is pretty cool, she‚Äôs trans.‚Äù Needless to say, we didn‚Äôt last, but my self-esteem is still pretty low from not being a ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù non-binary ‚Äúpartner‚Äù.

I‚Äôve been thinking about this for over ten years and I still don‚Äôt feel comfortable or confident. I‚Äôm nearly 29 and I just want to feel like... myself. But I don‚Äôt feel like anything at all. If you were to call me a man or woman, it wouldn‚Äôt resonate with me. ‚ÄúNon-binary‚Äù does a little bit but sometimes it feels so vague. I‚Äôve tried to look into other genders but there‚Äôs so many that I get overwhelmed. I know I don‚Äôt need a label but I just feel so disconnected from everybody because I just don‚Äôt know what I am and it seems like everyone else does. Is this really what non-binary is?

One thing I very much want to do is get rid of my damned uterus. I've always hated it, both because I don't identify one bit with the childbearing aspect of femininity, and because it causes me excruciating pain every time it does its thing. I've talked to doctors about it from both angles. When I ask about it as an option to solve the pain problems, I'm told I'm too young and hystetectomy is too risky pre-menopause, so I should just take contraceptives to suppress things.

In order to complete my essay, I need to conduct a small study of non-binary folks who would be able to answer a few super easy questions; just basically to gauge the community's opinion and expectations of what would happen if the whole world were to legally recognize a non-binary gender.

Please comment or shoot me a message if you'd be at all interested, or if you have any reading suggestions! I can also provide my initial draft of the essay and a literature review of some texts if you'd like more information on what I've been researching on the subject.

2020-04-16 16:27:09,g2i6aq,3,9,"(TLDR at the bottom!)

Hi folks,

I came out to my parents as nonbinary just after Christmas last year. They didn't respond negatively - in fact, they didn't really respond at all. I asked them if they had any questions about it and they said 'not now, no', and that was the end of it. A few days after we had something of a conversation in which they expressed to me that they wanted me to be safe and happy, and that I should make sure to think hard about life-changing things (like top surgery) before committing to them, but that it was my body and they wouldn't stop me if I wanted to. So far so good, I figured. I asked them to start using they/them pronouns for me, and to let me know if they had any questions about nonbinary stuff (as they didn't really know about it at all until I came out).

Fast forward to now - it's been almost 5 months, and they still misgender me almost constantly. I really hope it just comes from a place of genuine forgetfulness, though my mother has complained a couple of times that it 'sounds weird' because that's 'not correct grammar' - as she's always been a stickler for grammar, so I can understand why she would feel that way. They have been almost silent about it otherwise, though not necessarily UNsupportive; my mother has suggested more androgynous looks I might look good in and seems to have accepted that I won't wear another dress in my life, and my dad basically just hasn't said anything at all.

My problem is that I have no idea where they stand on all this. They never ask me about it or want to talk about it at all (and when we do I'm always the one starting the dialogue). When I try to remind them that my pronouns are they/them they either just say nothing or go 'oh yeah, they' in an almost half-hearted manner, but I have yet to hear either of them call me 'they' entirely unprompted or without a reminder.

I guess it's just weird. I think they're a bit uncomfortable with it because they don't understand it, but they're also not making an effort to try and understand it better either, and I feel like it's putting distance between us. I love my parents and they're cool about pretty much everything else, so to feel so... walled off from them due to this subject is really odd. Unfortunately I'm extremely bad at standing up for myself around them and am also very bad at conflict, so I'm finding it hard to be assertive about my pronouns and my identity, because I don't want to make the gap between us larger.

If anyone has any advice on what I should do/say, and maybe how to get better at talking to my parents about emotional matters without getting overly emotional, that would be great, thank you! And thanks for reading this far, if you got here &lt;3

I currently identify as a cis het male, but I've also long suspected that I might be nonbinary, and I've always tried to brush it off as passing thoughts. However, lately, I've started accepting that maybe I shouldn't always chalk these feelings up to just thoughts.

I've always had issues when it comes to my masculinity, but not so much in an emasculated way? I don't *mind* being a boy, and I'm not very insecure about my penis. I've just always felt like I was never enough of a boy as I might have wanted. I ""came out"" to my best friend (a very supportive cis het male) last night, and he asked me how it was any different from feeling like I didn't live up to gender roles/standards, and I told him that ultimately, it just felt like sometimes I'm very happy with my penis, but other times, it doesn't feel like it should be there at all. There are just many days where it feels as though my penis is detached from how I feel towards my body.

I think one qualm I've always had about identifying as an enby is that it's kind of a pride thing for me, that I've always wanted to grow up to be a positive role model for cis het men. Except now, being a man just doesn't always feel like it's my truth.

All this said, I just wanted to ask if all of this is something anyone else has experienced? Did any of you AMABs come to terms with being NB after feeling like your penis wasn't always supposed to be there? What was the line for you when it came to admitting your identity? And if I do admit to myself that this is my identity, how do I start coming out?

My situation:

I'm an AFAB gender apathetic person and I don't remove any hair on my body except for my head, which I shave bald every few days. Since my bald-headedness is seen by everyone and I'm open about it being a choice as opposed to due to health issues it should be obvious that I'm gender non-conforming, but maybe people think I hate hair and am a naked mole rat. My hair is dark and my armpit hair is long, so it's very noticeable if I wear certain clothes (and I've been very into tank tops lately) or move my arms at all. And my ""fur"" is a wild thing with a fun new 'do every day based on how it lays pressed against my underwear and pants.

I prefer to leave my body hair ungroomed but I still feel some anxiety with strangers seeing my armpit hair at times. But my big thing is deciding whether or not to give a new partner a heads up before they see the hair. I know I don't owe them that. I know it's my body to do with what I want.

I have had many friends throughout the years who are trans, non-binary, etc. and speak of dysphoria but I never really dug into that concept until recently. I‚Äôm AFAB, but have always been a ‚Äútomboy‚Äù, and when sorted at school by boys/girls- I would always absent mindedly join the ‚Äúboys‚Äù line. Every. Single. Time. 

As a child, I wanted to be a boy, but not overtly masculine. I remember actually feeling like I had a phantom appendage, male anatomy. I would spend a lot of time thinking about what would be like to feel like to experience things from the male form. Seriously- TMI, but I even learned how to pee standing up, facing the toilet, just like the boys and would do so privately and in shame. I thought it was just phase all kids go through because as an adult- I haven‚Äôt really questioned my identity and presentation as classically female. *twirl*

EXCEPT: I still find comfort in having the phantom appendage. I‚Äôm an adult, and still have this feeling- but it‚Äôs been that way for so long I never stopped to think maybe that wasn‚Äôt normal. I thought maybe having an imaginary penis was just a power thing? 

I HATE the sexual stimulation associated with ‚Äúbeing female‚Äù- breast stimulation and getting oral-because I hate these body parts. I just hate them. I do. And I hate being reminded of them, especially during sex. But again, rationalized that too as low self-esteem, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a woman, just not a good enough one‚Äù. 

The more I say this stuff out loud to myself, the dumber I feel. And more and more confused. 

So maybe my questions are: 

-is it strange to exist and feel like a body part you DON‚ÄôT have is actually real and present, and you like it that way? Is that dysphoria? 

- Is that non-binary? Like seriously, what is going on?! What do I DO now?

When I got them....I realized we were going to have a problem.  Like pretty much all boxer briefs, they don't have a gusset.

I'm not really sure what to do now.  I've been looking around and it seems like most gender-neutral or men's boxer briefs don't have a gusset.

2020-04-22 19:25:40,g67kio,8,3,"Hi everyone, this is something that I‚Äôve been struggling with for years and I‚Äôd love some input. Sorry if this is long! 

I‚Äôm a 22 year old AFAB who has always identified as cis, as I have no physical dysphoria at all. I really like presenting in a very typically feminine way (my aesthetic has been described as ‚Äúsoft VSCO girl‚Äù much to my chagrin, but I guess it fits). I cut my hair into a very short pixie a few years ago and I was actually quite uncomfortable with not feeling feminine enough. 

Mentally and socially, though, it‚Äôs a different story. Since I was little, I‚Äôve spoken/acted in masculine-coded ways, and I‚Äôve always had very masculine interests. For example, growing up I was obsessed with historical wars and scary plagues, and my biggest interests today include forging metal (like swords and stuff) and making ancient weaponry (like bows, paleolithic spears, atlatls) and playing games like Europa Universalis. Obviously this could just be eccentricity and I‚Äôve tried to be okay with being a woman with gender-non conforming interests, but it goes beyond that. I just don‚Äôt really feel like a woman and I don‚Äôt understand the ‚Äúfemale‚Äù experience. sorry if this sounds uneducated, and I know there is no universal ‚Äúfemale‚Äù experience, but I hear the phrase during discussions and can‚Äôt relate to it, and I have always had a lot of trouble fitting into women/femme social dynamics. 

I‚Äôve always had an easier time being friends with men, ever since kindergarten. I do have friends who are women, but it‚Äôs difficult for me to get close. Starting in middle school, I would compensate for this by forcing myself to act more feminine and would force myself to like things that other girls liked (like shows, music, artists, etc) in order to try to relate, but it always feels like I‚Äôm ‚Äúperforming‚Äù or wearing a mask that hides who I really am and it‚Äôs very alienating. I really always wanted to be like other girls, but I could never understand how to do that. Most of my friends are men and they‚Äôre great, we share interests and banter, but I know that I‚Äôm always an ‚Äúother‚Äù in the friend group and I‚Äôm embarrassed to come off as a ‚Äúcool girl‚Äù/‚Äúnot like other girls‚Äù type. I‚Äôve worried that I just have internalized misogyny but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what this is: I always liked and trusted other girls and wanted to be like them, but I just couldn‚Äôt figure out how to do that. 

I do feel very psychologically androgynous/masculine and sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm a man internally, but I don‚Äôt feel like a man either. I toyed with the idea that maybe I‚Äôm trans, but since I have no physical dysphoria and actually feel dysphoria at the idea of transitioning, I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm not. I do have some feminine traits. Which leads to me wonder if I‚Äôm non-binary, but I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs the case, either. I‚Äôm not comfortable with using they/them pronouns or identifying as non-binary (at least right now), because I don‚Äôt really feel enby and I‚Äôd feel like an imposter. I don‚Äôt feel uncomfortable being referred to as she/her or being gendered as a girl, but I don‚Äôt *feel* like a girl. It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôd be scared to come out- I go to a very leftist liberal arts school and have many queer and trans friends and my family is very pro-LGBTQ+. I just seriously do not feel like any gender- man, woman, enby, or even agender. I‚Äôve scoured the internet and queer theory and the closest I‚Äôve come is Judith Butler saying gender is a performance, but even then, the only time I feel like I‚Äôm not performing is when I‚Äôm being myself, and I don‚Äôt know where I fit in there, gender-wise. I just feel like I don‚Äôt fit into any of these categories, like I‚Äôm totally devoid of all gender. 

Does anyone have any similar experiences or resources that go into this phenomenon? Am I non-binary, or agender, or just a confused cis girl? Is it normal to feel aesthetically like your assigned gender, but psychologically, socially, and mentally totally genderless? I just feel totally lost and I have no idea who I am or where I fit in.

About five years ago, I was able to go from 215 to 157 in about a years time. I admit it wasn't the healthiest plan that I followed. I usually would restrict myself to less than a 1000 calories a day and go to the gym and burn about 1500 a day.

But when I did that, I hadn't had any surgeries and had just started testosterone. 

Now, five years later, I've had a hysterectomy, gotten off of testosterone and switched to estrogen and now I'm back on testosterone as of about a month ago. 

Weight isn't coming off like it did before. Which I understand is affected by not only the hysterectomy (menopausal symptom), but eating habits, activity level, thyroid issues, stress and being on different hormones. 

Barring all of that, ive found a healthier diet plan, especially after tons of research on it. 

I know now I have to be on a low carb diet. That I have a low calorie allowance and that I have to stick to it in order to lose weight. In the past month, I've been able to lose 13 pounds eating 1300-1500 calories a day, intermittent fasting(I fast from approximately 8pm to 11am give or take) , eating a high (healthy) fat, moderate protein and low carb diet, as well as 1.5 to 2 hours of actual cardio a day ( I also work at a pet supply store and am constantly moving for about 5-6 hours of an 8 hour shift). 

So I have the diet and cardio down. 

However I know that muscle building will help as well but I'm not sure how to go about it. I understand how the body works in terms of male vs female, but I don't know how to tailor my work outs for a more androgynous look. 

I have had top surgery, but I have a large ribcage and wide hips so I still have an hourglass figure, enough that I can still pass 100% as female wearing a skin tight dress, even without breasts. I do not mind having curves at all, and I understand that one can't lose weight in certain spots. That I'm fine with. 

Does anyone have additional advice or work outs they do? I can't go to a gym because of the shelter in place so my work outs are done at home. 

So far I do a lot of squats, lunges and crab walks but that's about all ive got. 

Does anyone have further advice ? I know I can't target fat on certain areas, but does anyone have any advice or has had a similar experience with surgeries and diet ?

Had a hard discussion with my boyfriend. I'm nonbinary on T for 3 weeks now and will get top surgery at the end of this year. I told him from the beginning of my ideas of being trans (figured it out while we are in relationship) and all my wishes and needs. He was always supportive and helped me through my process to get on T etc. He also knows about top surgery and is supportive here, too. He proposed to me 2 months ago, I said yes.
Tonight I asked him what he thinks about bottom surgery and if he would support me if I want this. He stottered and was unsure about that. After aksing him a couple of questions, he mentioned that he is unsure about if this is really what he wants for his future and that he don't want to be labeld as gay because he isn't. I get very angry and asked him what he thinks will happen when we walk on the road after my top surgery and when T changes more.
He was very quiet. After a while He said, that he won't to be read as homosexuell when he isn't gay. And that he doesn't mentioned it yet because He is afraid of loosing ne. I Was very upset and answered that I get read heterosexuel with him but I'm not (I'm pan). I asked him what he thinks how all this shit bothered me and that I'm totally afraid of loosing him, too. Then I stand up and now I'm sitting in our living room watching TV..

There are times I'm happy as a man and there are times I wish I was a woman. Then there are times I wish I could blend aspects of both. 

How do I separate my real feelings from personal preservation thoughts? Like am I just considering the option of occasionally dressing up as an alter ego to ""satisfy"" my feminine desires/curiosity in order to keep my heterosexual marriage of 10 years? Or will that really make me happy? 

Am I kidding myself?

I‚Äôve been questioning and exploring my gender for about a year now, and I kind of don‚Äôt know what to make of it. I‚Äôll go long stretches of time without feeling really any dysphoria. I‚Äôll feel totally comfortable fully in boymode (I‚Äôm AMAB) and it‚Äôll be fine. Other days stuff like my body hair, facial hair, and slightly receding hairline drive me BONKERS. I can‚Äôt get over that feeling that I‚Äôm just a fucked up and horny cishet but it‚Äôs hard to square that with the overwhelming desire to be smooth and have a full head of hair and wear dresses and all that. Today I just had an awful dysphoria day. I didn‚Äôt eat much and then I worked out and smoked some weed. Up to that point things had been pretty normal. Weed must have made me anxious or something because I had a full breakdown staring at myself naked in the mirror while psyching myself up to shower. I dont think I‚Äôve ever hated my dick like that before. I usually kinda love it, I‚Äôm somewhat of a switch/verse top so like, sex using my dick is fine, etc, but I just fucking hated it in that moment. I feel stuck somewhere between wanting to be a girl, wanting to be completely androgynous, and hating myself for not feeling like a man.

- I hate my stupid chest bags 

- I wanna look like Tom Waits when he was younger kinda ( like the hair and the general badass rogue hobo look- if you Google a picture of younger him you'll get what I'm trying to say but also be able to pull off a femme look on my more femme days that I sometimes have and im torn between these two things AGhhhhHhhh

- is 15 to late to start testosterone?

I just have this voice in my head sometimes saying ""fake trans fake trans fake trans"" and I try to block it out but it gets to me sometimes and I wonder, am I just a really masc chick??

First time posting on this subreddit.

For the last 6 months I'm questioning my gender, I don't know if I'm non binary or if I'm just lying to myself or something (you probably heard that before).

I'm a AMAB and I'm quite comfortable with my assigned gender, but just hate almost everything that's expected by this gender.
Let's just say I hate how you're quickly labeled as ""too femme"" for a male.

I think my mind has a lot of femme as well as masc thoughts,but the way I act in real life is mostly masc.

Luckily I'm out as bi to almost everyone I know, so I can get away with it if I act a little femme that day.

Thanks for reading, English isn't my first language so I hope it's quite clear.
If it's too vague feel free to ask questions I'll try my best to answer them.

I‚Äôm very new to this questioning gender thing, but I‚Äôm just a little curious. I haven‚Äôt been questioning for long, maybe 4 months-ish. I‚Äôm AMAB currently identifying as male and have a lot of typically masculine hobbies, like video games watching sports etc., but have always wanted to relate more to girls. In a lot of ways I see myself being closer in some ways to a female identity. I‚Äôve looked a little (okay maybe a lot) into gender and I‚Äôve learned about dysphoria, which pretty much sums up my feelings towards a few things about my body. I have a lot of hair on my body, and growing up I was indifferent, but it always stood out to me. As I‚Äôve grown older, the hair has become more prevalent and I just hate it. I shave it off on my legs, chest, and arms what has become like almost 4 times a week. And when I go out I try to cover up my body hair, even when I just shaved. Plus, when I shave I love the feeling. Physically, clothes feel better, and in general I feel confident. I also have a bit of chest dysphoria I think. Not having boobs makes me anxious, and having hair around my chest is one of the worst feelings, like I look at it and feel a major wtf feeling in my stomach. Hearing my deeep ass voice makes me really uncomfortable bc I hate the fact that it‚Äôs not higher pitched. In my head I always sound a bit higher pitched, but when I hear a recording of me I just don‚Äôt hear me if that makes sense. I could go on, there is a little bit more but I don‚Äôt wanna get into it. Somethings I do like though! I have really good curly hair almost like an Afro and it‚Äôs the one thing I kinda like. I‚Äôm just confused about it all. I don‚Äôt think being a woman is 100% my speed, but idk.

Hello, I‚Äôm a bissexual girl and I‚Äôm here seeking help. 

I don‚Äôt really feel dysphoria. I‚Äôm pretty happy with my female body and I‚Äôm comfortable with female pronouns and, over all, being a girl. 
_But_ I also feel comfortable with masculine pronouns. Sometimes people think I‚Äôm a boy and call me he/him and I‚Äôm totally fine with it, I don‚Äôt even correct them. I do like dressing up more masculine sometimes. 

So I usually say I go by any pronouns but I don‚Äôt really put much thought into it. I still kinda consider myself cis but I feel so r/egg_irl. One day I was talking to a friend and she asked me ‚Äúare you non-binary?‚Äù And, without thinking, I said maybe. 

And I don‚Äôt feel that much comfortable with they/them pronouns, but it can be mostly because my mother language doesn‚Äôt have gender neutral pronouns so it‚Äôs just weird to me when I‚Äôm called by they/them. 

So yeah, I don‚Äôt know exactly what I‚Äôm asking here. What could I be? I‚Äôm just a cis girl who likes to go drag king sometimes? Am I non-binary? I honestly don‚Äôt know.

Hey y‚Äôall! I am a non-binary femme and have always felt very uncomfortable and distressed about the size and function of my genitals - it has taken me a long time to accept these feelings and to classify them as dysphoria, but one day while surfing reddit I came across a clit growth sub and I immediately saw the before &amp; after pictures and felt jealous and sad (for myself) that I didn‚Äôt have that. Since then I have been doing endless reasearch, but the reddit sub I‚Äôm on is mostly cis women without any hormonal syndromes, so they don‚Äôt have much advice for me. I recently got my levels checked and my T and DHEA are in the very high range. You would think that would make my clit naturally large - but NOPE. It is tiny and so small, that when I was a teen trying to find it I truly thought I wasn‚Äôt born with one and that something was wrong with me. I‚Äôve always had problems orgasming with my girlfriend and past partners, also I just don‚Äôt like the way it looks - it really sucks and has caused me a lot of distress. 

DHT creams have been successfully used on the reddit subs I‚Äôm on for specific clit growth. As far as I know, they are very hard to get a prescription for and aren‚Äôt even available in the US, you have to order from overseas pharmacies and sometimes the packages can be seized. The only time I have even heard of anyone getting prescribed DHT cream is from my trans masc friends after being on T for multiple years - so I feel that as a nb femme it would be extremely difficult for me to obtain.

Searching around for DHT cream online, one place I found has various percentages of 8%, 12%, 20%, and 35%. The 8% cream is marketed as being ‚Äúwomen safe‚Äù üôÑ whatever that means, but I‚Äôm concerned because if my T levels are already high, I‚Äôm worried that my body won‚Äôt react to it and will ‚Äúabsorb‚Äù it I guess. At the same time, I also don‚Äôt want to go too high because it could make my other characteristics like excess body &amp; facial hair enhanced. However, even though I wouldn‚Äôt want to exacerbate that, I would deal with it if it means getting the results I want. Before COVID hit, I was getting electrolysis for my facial hair dysphoria that was working pretty well.

2020-04-25 14:00:03,g7ty9o,4,1,"Hello, I'm new here :)
So I know yall are no psychologists, I know you all don't know me, but I was hoping you could maybe talk with me about it or talk about ur own experiences, or give me a Tipp or two.
SO for the start: I am female assigned at birth, and tbh I am compleeeeetely comfortable calling myself a girl, and with she her pronouns. But ever so often I Jus tfeel kinda off.
When I was a kid I did not differentiate between girls and boys at all. I skateboarded, played vidoe games, played war with the neighbor boys and stuff flike that, dressing in jeans and shirts and getting all dirty, I also had barbies, and wore dresses etc. All though traditionally girly stuff was more rare than traditionally boyish stuff. (I know gender is a social construct but you get what I mean) I was compleeeeetely comfortable Jus tbeing a kid. I can actually pin point every moment that has felt off for me for the first times, when being forced to do smth or act a certain way, because I was female.
For example: my mum telling me I have to walk more girly and not that sloppy/boyish, in school the separation of girls and boys was really annoying to me because I didn't get it. Then already at 10 yrs old my boobs started to grow, and I felt rrly gross... At 12 I was bullied by older kids because I didn't wear a bra. So I forced myself to wear a bra. Then at 14 I had a phase where I cut my hair short and wore boxershorts etc. After that I had a extreme feminine phase for a few years. Although I was always the ""cool"" girl, because I still acted kinda to boyish, and was a good buddy to a lot of male friends. I started to really hate my chest. Because it's really large around a Double D slightly bigger. Then at around 18 I came out to my best friend as gender fluid. As I sometimes felt really girly, and then sometimes extremely masc. Wearing 2 sportbras and a button up, beanie to hide my hair etc. (also tbh I phantasized a lot about having a D) Then I had a rlly girly phase again. Now I'm 24 and I'm still fucking confused.
Am I disphoric about my chest or am I dismorphic how do I know that??? Because I'm a bit chubby, or rather thicc/curvy not fat though, so I have an overall more feminine body (I have a perfect hourglass figure, small waist big chest wide hips) so idk if I hate my body in general or if I hate the femininity of it I seriously don't know!!! I am juggling with the thought of getting chest reduction to like an A cup for YEARS now, like 8 years or smth. But I'm so afraid that in the end I didn't like it :(

But ever so often I Jus tfeel kinda off.\nWhen I was a kid I did not differentiate between girls and boys at all. I skateboarded, played vidoe games, played war with the neighbor boys and stuff flike that, dressing in jeans and shirts and getting all dirty, I also had barbies, and wore dresses etc. All though traditionally girly stuff was more rare than traditionally boyish stuff. (I know gender is a social construct but you get what I mean) I was compleeeeetely comfortable Jus tbeing a kid. I can actually pin point every moment that has felt off for me for the first times, when being forced to do smth or act a certain way, because I was female.\nFor example: my mum telling me I have to walk more girly and not that sloppy/boyish, in school the separation of girls and boys was really annoying to me because I didn\'t get it. Then already at 10 yrs old my boobs started to grow, and I felt rrly gross... At 12 I was bullied by older kids because I didn\'t wear a bra. So I forced myself to wear a bra. Then at 14 I had a phase where I cut my hair short and wore boxershorts etc. After that I had a extreme feminine phase for a few years. Although I was always the ""cool"" girl, because I still acted kinda to boyish, and was a good buddy to a lot of male friends. I started to really hate my chest. Because it\'s really large around a Double D slightly bigger. Then at around 18 I came out to my best friend as gender fluid. As I sometimes felt really girly, and then sometimes extremely masc. Wearing 2 sportbras and a button up, beanie to hide my hair etc. (also tbh I phantasized a lot about having a D) Then I had a rlly girly phase again. Now I\'m 24 and I\'m still fucking confused.\nAm I disphoric about my chest or am I dismorphic how do I know that??? Because I\'m a bit chubby, or rather thicc/curvy not fat though, so I have an overall more feminine body (I have a perfect hourglass figure, small waist big chest wide hips) so idk if I hate my body in general or if I hate the femininity of it I seriously don\'t know!!! I am juggling with the thought of getting chest reduction to like an A cup for YEARS now, like 8 years or smth. But I\'m so afraid that in the end I didn\'t like it :(\nI buzzed all my hair off in February and I LOVE It, I have a short mullet going on rn and I feel so nice gender neutral üíïüíïüíï but thhen sometimes I wear a wig and a dress.

2020-04-26 01:31:33,g85lhr,2,1,"Hi! 

It's been some months since I felt confident enough to think myself as a nonbinary.

I always though being trans was an experience that others deserved because they could access to their real gender, and I wouldn't allow myself the chance to think if the gender I was assigned at birth felt good.

I've bough some clothes that made me euphoric, cut my hair in a way I felt euphoric, changed my name to one that made me feel I was getting closer to be myself in front of the others.

Quarantine has stopped my public presence. At home I feel like I don't perform, nobody is reading me or expecting from me. I'm just me.

It felt like I got stuck. I don't feel dysphoria because no one is misgendering me, and I don't feel euphoria because just being, existing, feels neutral.

I first thought this was the proof I actually wasn't trans, or that I wasn't transitioning right. This was because until now I didn't have the chance yet to simply be me, enjoying life in my conditions, even if quarantine isn't the best moment to do so. But gender is not a problem now. I thought being trans meant living a cycle of dysphoria and euphoria. But I think I kinda figured it out. 

It's weirdly chilling, there is no final step, no celebration. It's as everybody says: the only person who can know my gender is me! 

Does anyone there felt this? Any tips?

I'm a 21 AFAB, and like a huge swath of people my age I was - for a large part of my youth - swept up in the whole anti-sjw fervor for a few years. However, recently I've realised that my views were actively toxic to those around me. I had a friend come out as a transman, and that was a huge wake up call for me.

I had always dismissed enby people, mostly because I thought they were overanalysing emotions that everyone has.

I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs because the label non-binary doesn‚Äôt feel right, or if I don‚Äôt want it to feel right. I‚Äôve felt like a woman for pretty much my whole life. I prefer she/her pronouns but I‚Äôm also not opposed to using they/them. I just feel more disconnected than usual from my body and I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm disconnected from womanhood or just having kind of a rebellious phase where I don‚Äôt want to be trapped by femininity. Maybe it‚Äôs a little of both?

I don‚Äôt think I have dysphoria. I‚Äôm fine with the top - in fact I wish they were bigger- but sometimes I have confusing feelings about the bottom. I‚Äôm not in a position where I would ever wanna have surgery or hormones but sometimes...I honestly don‚Äôt know how to explain it. Something just feels *off* sometimes. But usually it feels fine. I understand that even for cis people gender can sometimes be complicated and it‚Äôs okay to explore and figure out what feels right. Maybe it‚Äôs more of a lesbian thing, and I just feel slightly more right now. I just started coming out as a lesbian last year.

Most of the reason I dress slightly masculine is because of deep-seeded weight/ED issues, so it‚Äôs possible that they are just getting in the way of me feeling ‚Äúfeminine enough.‚Äù I‚Äôm also having some issues with pcos/hormonal imbalance, and I‚Äôm wondering if that could possibly be contributing.

But at the same time, WHY do I need to feel ‚Äúfeminine enough?‚Äù Is it because I‚Äôm in denial about being non-binary, or is it because I am actually a cis woman who wants to feel more feminine but can‚Äôt because of body issues?

It could change at any moment. It has before. Honestly tomorrow I could feel totally different, and the next day completely different from that. If anyone has any website/subreddit recommendations I would also really appreciate  those. Thank you.

I‚Äôm gonna try to be as short and clear as possible but it MIGHT get messy so, sorry for that. I‚Äôm AFAB btw.

Also, I will mention abuse and internalized sexism, so take care of yourselves !

To put it in one sentence : I‚Äôm questioning my gender. And I‚Äôm really confused. 

Thing is : I was always a ¬´ tomboy ¬ª, kinda liked the ¬´ femme ¬ª aesthetic but when I put a dress on, I feel URH, and like I‚Äôm wearing a costume. Same goes with make-up. So many times, I wished I could be androgynous enough to put make-up on without looking so typically ¬´ ¬´ ¬´ girly ¬ª ¬ª ¬ª, and wear a dress without people being so sure about my gender. 
I always liked playing the androgynous card, and Halloween was often me trying to look as masc as possible, ¬´ for fun ¬ª.

I know for sure I‚Äôm not a guy, though. Masculine pronouns feel wrong. Feminine pronouns sometimes are ok and sometimes make me cringe. It depends. In English, they is great, but in my own language, none of the existing alternative pronouns feel right. 

All of this is pretty ¬´ non-binary ¬ª, right ? BUT I don‚Äôt know. 

There is several things that are making me doubt and doubt and doubt. 

First, I feel like I don‚Äôt want to give up my ¬´ woman ¬ª experience, the ¬´ Girl Power ¬ª stuff, and all that. And I don‚Äôt want to be fighting to look androgynous or more masc on a day to day basis, not enough energy for that. Also most of the time I‚Äôm ok with how I look ? And sometimes I feel REALLY ¬´ femme ¬ª ? 

Second, I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm feeling that way towards my gender, not because i‚Äôm NB but because of what happened to me. I was abused, I got PTSD from it, and my relationship with my body has been bad for so long. I‚Äôm scared I might be trying to escape my trauma by distanciating myself from ¬´ ¬´ ¬´ the cause ¬ª ¬ª ¬ª aka my femininity. Or that it would be internalized sexism that makes me want to not be a girl, instead of really being NB ?

I don‚Äôt know if I make sense. 
Anyway‚Ä¶ I was wondering if someone here had the same struggle, and/or tips to get past it ? 

Thank you all for being yourselves and giving me the strength to say all that out loud. 
Lots of Love !

Also being on Internet, where you don't know who's on the other side reading, I prefer to stick to gender-neutral when I don't know how the other person identifies. 

So another clarification, my native language is Spanish, not English.

In Spanish I would just say novie instead of novio/a or pareja (partner), but I think partner is not used in English in a romantic way as much in Spanish (I have seen partner to refer to a romantic partner in English, but in Spanish it's very used, so I'm not sure if it's as natural to say it in English as it is in Spanish, or if it has a connotation like a long-term relationship), and since the word would be boyfriend/girlfriend, I can't come up with a non-binary alternative.

At that point in my life, I believed firmly I was a woman with a liking of short hair. I go between boyish and girlish and don't feel a strong attachment to either. In my head, I was a normal woman with short hair.

Being misgendered wasn't a daily occurrence, but it happened, and shaving my head just made it happen more often. I still don't care about it. You can use male, female or neutral pronouns with me and I won't bat an eye.

A pizza delivery guy called me sir, then corrected themselves when they saw my face.

I told my group of friends, expecting a reaction similar to mine 'Omg that's funny. Poor dude was so awkward.' Instead I got one of them being so upset I was misgendered. 'He's such a moron for not knowing you're a woman. How can he not see you're clearly a woman?'. I replied to that 'My head is shaved and I wear baggy clothes. I look more like the image of a man than I woman from behind.' Her answer was 'He stills should have known. You clearly are a woman.'

This interaction really got me thinking. A few months later, a lot of my non binary and cis friends started this post trend on Facebook of asking everyone their preferred pronouns. Everyone, that included cis people that assume they shouldn't have to say it since they conform to the norm. I looked at those posts and seriously couldn't answer anything other 'Use whatever you want, just talk to me respectfully.'

I talked about this with a trans friend, since we often talk about gender norms and gender exploration. She said that maybe I was non-binary, but was closer to woman than man. It is a spectrum afterall.

I'm young compared to a lot of you, only a few years away from high school in my state (""high school"" being grades 10-12). My school just got the registration forms on the site, and I planned to ask about using my preferred name/pronouns either this year or once I'm actually in high school. I just don't really know how to go about it, if they'll let me, or if my parents will approve. 

Bit of info on my parents: They kind of just tolerate my gender identity. They won't use my name or pronouns unless they're teasing me, and my dad finds it unfair that ""he has to call me something other than my God-given name."" He also tells me I'm just confusing people by asking them to call me my preferred name and should stop.

Along with the name part, I'm a choir kid and don't feel comfortable being in the female choir. It's kind of made me think about just being in the male choir or trying for both, but I doubt my school would allow it even if my vocal range was that wide. I love singing, but I'm sick of having massive dysphoria and panic attacks each concert because of the group I'm with. 

I feel like anything I do is wrong in the situations. Quitting my hobby, something I want to use in my life, wouldn't be right.

If I ask to join male choir, it wouldn't do much for me currently because I don't have that wide vocal range and the others would probably mess with me constantly.

When I think about myself with different features, I feel euphoric, and when I see pictures of transfeminine folks I think to myself that I want to look like them.

2020-04-30 10:04:31,gaswbs,0,1,"A couple weeks ago, I was using the emoji keyboard and found that there was a third gender option! I got really excited. I feel like there's been a quick-moving wave of acknowledgement given to non-binary people since we've become more visible: from many states adding a third gender option to licenses, to the singular 'they' pronoun being declared word of the decade (by the American Dialect Society among others), to now a third gender being codified in the most universal dictionary in the world (the emoji dictionary!)

I think this is a big deal. And perhaps non-binary people aren't officially the motivation for this move, but I think we're definitely a piece of it. And really, it comes down to how words/emojis are used, not how they're intended. That's how language works, it evolves! Think of the word gay... Think of singular they/them... Think of the peach emoji...

Lol anyway, if you'd like, check out this video I made about it and feast your eyes on the 78 Apple and 55 Android non-binary emojis (shown in the center column in the video)!

I started on low dose for around 3-4 months (20mg a week I think, by injection). now I'm on about 50mg a week, having worked my way up from the 20. I took an unanticipated break in march 2020 for about 2-4 weeks due to havent having been to the doc and having picked up my last refill, and I have phone anxiety so calling the doc was tuff.



I really like how the fat (and muscle?) has redistributed in my face to make it more jawline-y, and if u look really close at my chin on the last photo u can see I havent shaved in a while haha.
