I can't change my legal name anytime soon for practical reasons, including that I'm not ready yet to come out to everyone else in my life, but I do prefer the gender-neutral name I've chosen (very close to my 'old' name) and they/he pronouns.

My ask is twofold. 

1) How do you handle asking people to use your preferred name when your deadname is still different? 

Example: if my family had to speak to the bank for me, they would have to refer to me as my deadname. Or if my doctor wrote a letter about me, using my preferred name, wouldn't that be confusing as it's not my legal one? I worry this would be too much to ask of anyone and would just cause problems.

2) How realistic should I be about getting family to use my pronouns/name?

I'm 25 and my parents are both near 70, my mom in particular has a lot of health conditions that mean her memory is impaired. They've been super supportive and we've had good open chats about my gender, but because of their age, my mom's memory, and the fact I've been their 'daughter' for so long, they've told me it's going to be really difficult to remember to refer to me differently. My mom is also confused by they/them as a pronoun, she said 'It's hard enough to remember to call you 'he' instead'.

I recently realized I’ve been Non-Binary for a lot of my life and am beginning the process of coming out to people in my personal life.

Besides my wife, my Dad is my biggest supporter who helped me when I was questioning religion, relationships, being a writer, and through all of it he was a champion and supporter of mine.

He married a woman recently who is very homophobic and even decided that my younger brother (her son with my Dad) can’t even wear dresses for fear of him being teased or bullied (her reasons).

We’ve become less essential parts of each other’s lives since then and I’m worried that since he hasn’t been there for all the discussions and talks we’d normally have before making a decision like this - my coming out will be a bit of a shock.

I’m about fifty fifty on whether he’ll accept or be supportive or not. It will be a big challenge to his world views even though he tends to be very liberal and is an atheist.

2020-03-02 21:25:12,fcjaem,5,1," 

Hello, so I am cis, and my partner recently came out as nonbinary, and I am having a really hard time understanding it, and coming to terms with it, and I would like some help. I have aspergers and OCD, and this is absolutely not an excuse for shitty behavior, but I have spent my whole life breaking everything down into categories, and numbers. I love statistics, order and anything of that nature. Effectively I am comforted by consistency and transparency, and stuff that breaks it stresses me out. I have spent a lot of time trying to midigate these tendencies, but there is still a lot of work to be done.   


So, admittedly one of my biggest issues is understanding/ being comfortable with trans people. Less so MtF, or FtM, but rather people who don’t fit into a clear category, or shift between them. I know this isn’t a good mindset to have, and I feel bad for having it, and I will continue to try to become more “woke” about it, but I have spent years trying to and progress has been minimal, and I am deeply sorry about this, for their sake, and for the sake of any trans person.

So, when they came out to me I was completely supportive, not in actuality, but I presented myself as such. I have always been a bit gender nonconforming, so I tried to view it from that perspective, and it seemed to be fine. However over the last few months they have started to float, and enact more and more “extreme” changes. They changed their name and started hormones, and have also gotten really involved with the local trans community. And now most drastically getting a double mastectomy, or “at the very least” getting extreme breast reduction surgery. Here I accept responsibility, as I did not react well to this, but it is such a drastic and permanent change, that for whatever reason just makes me skin crawl when I think about it. I feel like an asshole for that, and a few of my friends said that I am one for caring that much about breasts, which I guess is fair. So we tried to move past this, but it just hasn’t been successful.

I ended up confiding that I love my partner, because I really really do, and I will respect all their choices expect for that one, but I also deep down will always see them as their previous self, and on a personal level I do not genuinely believe they are nonbinary, and that I will be faking acceptance because despite this massive thing about them I don’t like, there is far more about them I do like. They, understandably, were furious and said that if I can’t love them for who they are then we shouldn't be together,and that they want stuff to be authentic. Further more, they said they would not even feel comfortable being my friend if I don't feel authentically, which is my absolute nightmare. They have been my best friend for almost a decade, and I cannot imagine a life without them. If I have to break up with them for their health then so be it, I don't want too, but I love them and want to help them. However there isn't a switch that automatically makes me get this, and I just so desprately don't want to loose the most important person in my life completely.

And furthermore, I understand and respect their position, but at the same time, I don’t care about authenticity, I never have, it is a concept that just makes no moral sense to me. I don't know if this stems from autism or what, but to me, as long as we are both benefiting, I don’t care about intentions. I really care about transparency though. 

So here is where I feel stuck. They can’t help their gender, and I cannot help how I feel, but both of us would be miserable separated because we have been such a good combo. I am willing to suppress how I feel because they matter more to me than some discomfort. However I am asking for them to set aside their desire for authenticity to have the same respect for the fact that I really am struggling, and trying, to adapt to this. I feel it is better that we both get most of what we want, than us both being miserable, or one of us getting something that the other’s expense. I also said that their body is their choice, but I also really would like if we could find a middle ground in regards to the breasts, or at least hold off till such a drastic choice is made.  
They said they would think about this, but have ghosted me since. I just really want this to work, because I cannot picture my life without them, and I am willing to make whatever sacrifice is needed to make it work, at least as friends, because I love them so much. However at the same time, and I know this is completely unfair, but I just need to vent this, but the whole world is set up in a way that doesn't make sense to me, and furthermore, my percieved lack of emotions (I am just as emotional as anyone, just differently) is vilified. No matter who I am with, no matter what I do, I will always have to act nuerotypical and do things that I find uncomfortable and work in a moral framework that upsets me. Because of this, I do feel hurt in a way as I will always be forced to compromise no matter what, even when stuff upsets me. To give an example of that, the reason the breast thing stresses me out so much is because my partner said their goal is to have ""their breasts be indistingusable from pecs"". I need to categorize everything I see, and if I can't distingiush if something is A or B it brings me a ton of horrible anxiety. I know that it shouldn't be between one or the other, but I am stressed by any form of andragony, and my partner knows this, so again, unjustifiably, it feels like a batryal.    


I just need time to try to adjust to this, and it is all just happening so fast and I don’t want it to be over, at the very least not our friendship. We were both happy when I was faking it and I just want to go back to that with maybe a bit of middle ground when it comes to breasts.

Also I am really sorry if anything in here was offensive or I misused words or anything. I really really don't mean this community harm.

TLDR: My partner came out as nonbinary and is going on hormones and also wants to get surgery.

I don’t like identifying as female. It doesn’t feel like me. I present masculine/androgynous, and I don’t like wearing female clothes, however I’ve tried to force myself, and I’ve hated it every time. I know I’m not ftm tho because I’ve gone through a time when I thought I was and that didn’t feel right either. Dysphoria is kind of a tough subject, because I’m not sure how to feel a lot. My boobs? Yeah they can screw off, but it’s different with my genitals. Sometimes I’m okay with it and other times I just wish there wasn’t anything there. I would like to start going by they/them, but my name, Isabella, which is feminine, I do like. Not sure why. Probably because I’ve had it my whole life. But if I were to use that name and they/them I feel like there would be confusion? There are times where I try to force myself to believe, “You are female! You were born one!

Yeah they can screw off, but it’s different with my genitals. Sometimes I’m okay with it and other times I just wish there wasn’t anything there.

2020-03-03 02:02:49,fcnblf,5,1,"hi folks! so, exciting news, I’ve been approved for top surgery (ok technically it’s getting billed as a radical reduction but who cares). I’m navigating how to tell my friends and get time off from work, but one thing I’m still stuck on is how to tell my family. Right now my gender presentation is def more on the side of “tomboy” for convenience/comfort, but top surgery will be a pretty drastic change to my appearance. I’m not out to my family at all, and am generally low contact/information diet with them. 

here’s kind of what I’m struggling with in terms of whether I should come out to my family about my identity and getting top surgery:

PROS:
- don’t have to figure out a lie about why my chest has suddenly disappeared 
- gives them the opportunity to be emergency contacts for the surgeon in case something were to go wrong
- there’s a small possibility they will be supportive, and may want to help me out with recovery, which would lessen the burden on my partner

CONS:
- they will probably not be supportive and will try to talk me out of it
- general “but you’re our little girl” dysphoria inducing comments
- have to do the work of explaining gender to them, likely a bunch of times
- tiny possibility they will do something drastic like show up at my house to try and prevent me from getting surgery

2020-03-03 05:05:01,fcpmer,2,1,"okay so. i've been questioning things about my gender for a bit now, and i wanted to get other people's advice.

im afab, but i think i might be nonbinary? i have had very vivid chest dysphoria and hair dysphoria (as in, having my hair longer than chin-ish length makes me sick to my stomach because i look too ""girly""), and every now and then i'll have a type of voice dysphoria where i just hear my voice and i immediately cringe because it sounds way too high and wrong. but other than that, that's about it for dysphoria. 

im not sure how i feel about pronouns, because nobody has ever really used ""they/them"" for me, and so right now being called ""she"" is not great, but its not awful. 

i don't think i'd go on T, mainly because body hair and all that stuff, but if i could find maybe a way to bind, i think i'd like that. 

anyways here's where my major issues come in. 1) my parents are super conservative and probably don't believe in this sort of thing. 2) my older brother is a transgender dude. 3) even though i act/dress very tomboyishly, i still look pretty girly, which i don't like. 

predicament 2 is really my major problem. i don't feel valid in any way, shape, or form, because what's the likelihood of there being 2 trans kids in a family? (very very verY UNLIKELY). my parents would think that i was just mirroring his behavior and wanting attention. my brother wouldn't believe me and call me a trender. and idk. 

like, yeah i feel really uncomfortable with these things about myself, but is it because im uncomfortable with my own body and dont want to be associated with female elements? or is it influences from my brother? or am i just trying to find a new label to stick on myself to give a bit more stability to my foggy self-image? once again, idk. sorry for ranting so long.

I couldn't find any threads for personal questions... Mods, forgive my poor wretched soul if this doesn't belong here. I feel a bit silly making a post just for this, but I had a conversation with my mother a little while ago that's got the gears going, and I have nobody to talk to about this, so I thought I'd ask you all. 

Anyway, we were talking about how fucking weird gender is (she's in biology, as am I), and the more I think about it, the weirder it feels. My sex is female, but if you asked me to describe myself, it'd feel weird calling myself a ""woman"". Honestly, I think I just don't understand gender. I mean, I know a bit about it in the scientific sense, but I don't ""get"" it. It's never been part of my life. I always just did what I wanted to do, and was whoever I wanted to be. I guess females doing stereotypically male things isn't looked at the same way as the reverse (ah, sexism!), so it wasn't mentioned much. Obviously gender is important to a lot of people, and it helps to form their identity, but I don't even know what that's supposed to feel like. I'm confused as all hell.

For example, if you told me that I was going to magically turn into a man tomorrow, it wouldn't make me uncomfortable. I'd be pretty damn happy about it, actually. It's not like I feel dysmorphic about the body I have... More like, ""Shit, it was a 50/50 on that one and I lost. Oh well"". But I wouldn't really say that I feel like a man either, though I sometimes wish I was born with the male sex. I just like the way males look better, like I'd rather have brown eyes than blue. Transitioning is not something I would consider doing.

Anyway, at the end of the day, I guess it doesn't matter much as it won't really affect my life, but I'm kind of curious as to whether I'm technically non-binary or if I'm misunderstanding what being non-binary entails.

i've been having intense gender issues and contemplations for probably 6 months now (i say intense because i've repressed it all these years and during the earlier years i didn't know anything about other genders, still don't know a lot but now i'm learning and actually contemplating) and i'm still confused.

i'm afab and i do not feel any sort of comfort being called she/her or any other feminine terms. they/them is definitely something i feel comfortable with (i cried the first time haha) but my feelings with he/him... i don't know?? i generally have preferred more masculine things but the idea of being called he/him and masculine terms, i can't describe the feeling. it's not the same as the discomfort of she/her/etc but it just feels really weird? it doesn't feel as comfortable as they/them but it's much better than she/her. one feeling i'm sure though (but still a bit afraid to admit) is that i want a male body (can't think about transitioning though because financial stuff and parents will never approve)

so like i cannot tell if i'm a confused and scared trans male (since throughout my life i've been denied of portraying myself as more masculine and participating in more masculine things, therefore being shoved into all things feminine with great reluctance. so a part of me speculates that maybe because of all this, i repressed all those feelings and now i'm scared???) or do i still fall in the spectrum of nonbinary? because i definitely do feel great comfort in being called they/them and things i know that relate to nonbinary. i've also always been attracted to things labelled as ""unisex"" but i'm also afraid if i subconsciously convinced myself that this attraction is just a fallback for my denied masculinity. if that makes sense.

tldr: not sure if i'm nb because i want a male body and i can't tell if my nb feelings are just because my masculinity feelings have been denied for most of my life. i feel comfy with the nb identity but is it valid to want a male body??? like is it possible to identify as a trans male but also being nonbinary???",NonBinary,confused? i think i'm nb but :(,1583269143.0,"{'created_utc': 1583243943, 'id': 'fcuxtk', 'num_comments': 10, 'score': 1, 'selftext': '(long(?) post with a tldr at the end)\n\ni\'ve been having intense gender issues and contemplations for probably 6 months now (i say intense because i\'ve repressed it all these years and during the earlier years i didn\'t know anything about other genders, still don\'t know a lot but now i\'m learning and actually contemplating) and i\'m still confused.\n\ni\'m afab and i do not feel any sort of comfort being called she/her or any other feminine terms. they/them is definitely something i feel comfortable with (i cried the first time haha) but my feelings with he/him... i don\'t know?? i generally have preferred more masculine things but the idea of being called he/him and masculine terms, i can\'t describe the feeling. it\'s not the same as the discomfort of she/her/etc but it just feels really weird? it doesn\'t feel as comfortable as they/them but it\'s much better than she/her. one feeling i\'m sure though (but still a bit afraid to admit) is that i want a male body (can\'t think about transitioning though because financial stuff and parents will never approve)\n\nso like i cannot tell if i\'m a confused and scared trans male (since throughout my life i\'ve been denied of portraying myself as more masculine and participating in more masculine things, therefore being shoved into all things feminine with great reluctance. so a part of me speculates that maybe because of all this, i repressed all those feelings and now i\'m scared???) or do i still fall in the spectrum of nonbinary? because i definitely do feel great comfort in being called they/them and things i know that relate to nonbinary. i\'ve also always been attracted to things labelled as ""unisex"" but i\'m also afraid if i subconsciously convinced myself that this attraction is just a fallback for my denied masculinity. if that makes sense.\n\ntldr: not sure if i\'m nb because i want a male body and i can\'t tell if my nb feelings are just because my masculinity feelings have been denied for most of my life. i feel comfy with the nb identity but is it valid to want a male body??? like is it possible to identify as a trans male but also being nonbinary???', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': ""confused? i think i'm nb but :("", 'created': 1583269143.0}"

2020-03-04 00:15:55,fd4b35,5,1,"thank god for the ""rant"" flair, bc this is gonna be a rambling mess of a post lmao. so as you can probably tell from my username, i'm a lesbian. and i've always had a nebulous relationship with gender, i think bc of my lesbian identity. it took me... a really, really long time to get to the point where i was comfortable calling myself a lesbian. i knew i liked girls since i was a kid, had crushes on girls in elementary school, very dramatically came out to my mom when i was ten and thought that my sister had read my diary where i'd talked about my crush, and then immediately went back in the closet when she was like, are you sure? are you sure you don't just want to be her best friend? in high school i decided i had to be pansexual, bc i found fictional guys attractive and the word ""lesbian"" made my stomach do funny things, but i didn't date anyone in high school bc i was an introverted nerd who was still coming to terms w all that. a very nice guy asked me on a date and kissed me in college and i immediately was like ""oh holy shit nope i'm a lesbian this is Wrong"" and i never looked back. 

so yeah, i'm definitely. comfortable as a lesbian. and i know that nonbinary lesbians exist, i'm acquaintances w more than one. so at least i'm confident that no matter what i decide for my gender identity, it doesn't have to impact my sexuality, i can still be a lesbian. 

but like. *gender.* god. when i was tiny, me and my siblings would play house, and i always wanted to be the three-year-old boy named peter. in fifth grade, same grade as when i came out for the first time (which, hysterically enough, neither my mother or my sister remember. like it's fuckin incredible how something can mess you up so bad for years and no one else even *remembers* it), i was an orphan in my school's production of annie, and i asked my mom if i could be a boy orphan. i really wanted to wear a jaunty lil newsboy cap and some trousers and suspenders and be a rough and tumble troublesome lil orphan kid instead of a girl in an old patchy dress. so there's that. and then like, not to go tmi, but big dick envy. lots of fantasies about having one, a packer was one of my first sex shop purchases. 

so yeah, genderweirdness has been a bit of a theme throughout my life. but i never really felt like doing anything about it or really questioning further bc like, butch lesbian (or i try to be. don't really have the facial structure or confident swagger to be the butch i dream of being lol). my full name's kirsten, but i love when people call me kirsty, even though it's like, a girlier diminutive, and for the most part, i'm chill w being viewed as a girl. 

except. i want to crawl out of my goddamn skin every time a man perceives me as a woman. like not even just catcalling and shit -- i don't like it when perfectly polite men call me ""ma'am"" or ""miss."" i don't like the knowledge that they view me as a woman. i'm fine w women perceiving me as a woman, as long as they view me as a gnc/butch woman who's attracted to other women, which is how i try to present myself. 

idk why, but for some reason lately i've just been feeling a pull to actually think deeper about this huge mess of gender feelings, even though i've never felt the need to delve into it deeper beyond ""my gender is lesbian"" or ""yeah i've got some genderweird feelings but i'm mostly cis"" in the past. i want to try out using ""she/they"" pronouns -- i feel like i wouldn't be a straight up ""they/them"" bc i do still identify as wlw? 

i asked my online friends, and two of my irl friends (who i don't get to see in person that often, rip), to use they/them as like a trial run, but... idk it's weird. no one online really uses they/them in reference to me, bc i don't really participate in any big group chats, all my discord servers that i'm active on are legit just two or three people including me. i could probably test it out better at work, i have a genderqueer coworker and a bisexual coworker in my department and they'd be down for testing out they/them (well, one of them would. funnily enough, the genderqueer coworker who uses any pronouns is the one who is dreadful with pronouns and never remembers to use they/them for coworkers who exclusively use they/them pronouns). but i don't wanna do that in my workplace and then down the line be like ""yeah psyche go back to she/her, turns out i'm just cis sorry bout that.""

i don't even wanna know how long this post is now lol, i just had to spew all this out i guess. how did you guys realize that your pronouns were right for you? i defs welcome any thoughts/advice on all of this.

in the german language many words imply a certain gender.  
If i don't want to imply any gender i have to rephrase the sentence.

in english ""I'm a teacher""   
in german you would either say ""Ich bin ein Lehrer"" or ""Ich bin eine Lehrerin"" depending on how you identify.   
If you don't want to identify you have to use ""Ich unterrichte in einer Schule"" -&gt; ""I teach at a school"".  


Sadly it is not really in my head right now, and sometimes i end  up starting a sentence in a way, so that i have to identify even if i don't want to or i have to restart. Is there any better way than just stopping what i said and to start again?

2020-03-04 04:58:33,fd7zfz,2,1,"Hi everyone.

So I've been questioning my gender for a fair bit now. I'm AFAB and first swung toward the FtM side, until I realized that didn't really fit. I'm in a bit of a conundrum-- I definitely have dysphoria, both physical and social. I've been through the whole process of questioning whether it may be dysmorphia, and it's really just my gendered characteristics I'm uncomfortable with. I want to essentially look male with a female base, if that makes sense, beyond just presenting masculinely. I think I actually feel comfortable with he/him pronouns... even if I don't feel like a guy or think of myself as one, it does provide a respite from dysphoria. I'd rather be seen as a guy than a girl.

However, I keep getting caught up on the idea of how gender ""feels."" I don't exactly feel a gender, I think, but I do feel some connection to femininity due to being raised that way and associating it positively due to good role models. Furthermore, I feel more comfortable with girls than boys, which I often see cited as evidence of a female identity (I think I like hanging out with boys more though in order to not be ""associated"" with femininity). Essentially, on the inside I don't feel much of any gender except for a very faint ""maybe female-ish,"" and yet I have dysphoria pointing more toward male. I don't think I feel any sort of male identity. When I think of myself, I just think of me, but whenever I'm in situations regarding how others see me I consistently think of myself as female.

2020-03-04 05:18:01,fd87ho,0,1,"So I have been through a lot not only during my
teenage years and early 20s, but especially this
past year and a half as well.  I’ve been asking
myself about myself in many ways, and for this
past month it’s been “am I even a woman?”
I have been seeking answers online, and feel
that I fit under non-binary.  I was leaning towards
Demi-girl, but I asked myself, “is it because of
your upbringing?”  I looked back at my upbringing,
and I never fit in with girls.  My mom always 
dressed me in dresses and bows, though I liked 
them, it always didn’t feel right to some extent.
I think she seen this at one point and insisted
that I try to dress in boy clothes to see how I feel.
It was awesome!  I felt like myself, but I never
made friends because I was the weird kid that
dressed like a boy, but I felt I couldn’t be as cute as
the other girls.  Not only that,but I always had a
different mindset than them, and was too busy
idolizing them, which I now realize they were little 
crushes.  

When I was a teen through my 20s, my mom
pushed me to be girly and convinced me it was 
not ok to be a Tom boy.  I was so used to the look,
it was super weird to be in women’s clothes, I felt
I didn’t deserve to be in them, because I didn’t have
what the rest of the females have.  It took about 
ten years to get the feminine look down, though I
feel it’s not all there, and now I’m questioning who
I really am.  Today I wore a boyish look today and
felt out of my element.  

I feel I was forced to act a certain way when it 
wasn’t truly me, and I’m so confused about gender
I just wanna say fuck it all, I just wanna dress what I
feel good in!  If I feel boyish, I wanna be able to show it!

May I add, since I’ve dressed a boyish over the past
few days, I felt out of my element, but at the same
time I felt freedom.  But not fully me.  Maybe I just
gotta find that in between and I’ll be good!

Right now, I feel like a woman with a mindset not
fully as one, I have days I fantasize having male
anatomy, but that occurrence is so rare, I fully 
embrace my female parts!  It doesn’t help that I have
PCOS either, I CAN NOT stand having body hair!
I have interests that are equally male and female,
 and I think it’s so dumb that society set it up as such.  

I guess I just wanted to get this down somewhere.

Only my tummy is in the way. When I try on pants that are a bit bigger it looks weird and too big around my legs.  I just wanna lose some tummy fat so I can wear the pants that fit around my legs and butt. Some dresses fit nicely around my waist but are way too big around my chest because they're designed for people with boobs. Also my shoulders and arms sometimes look weird in dresses.

I really love elegant clothes (although I mostly can't afford them because I'm broke) but I can't find anything that looks good on me. I do prefer suits because I look a bit better in them but I would wear a nice dress too. 

I can't really ask if anyone knows a place that sells cheap, elegant, fitting clothes tho because I'm European and we don't have the cool America stores.

At this point I'm just mad at this little tummy. I'm not overweight or chubby. My arms, my butt, my chest: everything is rather thin! It's literally just my tummy that's a bit bigger.

A few days ago, my mother also let me shop in the men's section at a store for the first time ever too! Got some really awesome shirts that fit my aesthetic so well and i love how they fit on my body ( That made me wayy happier than it probably should lol is this normal? ).

Im currently thinking of getting a second (better fitting) binder, and even though im still not all that sure about my identity ( been out as a lesbian for a few years now, but I'm starting to really think I'm NonBinary, haven't fully came out to mom about the enby thing though so yikes ), I've been feeling a lot more confident in myself and who i am, no matter what label(s) i choose to use in the end.

2020-03-05 17:18:34,fdyj04,5,1,"So, I (19M) have always been quite comfortable in my masculinity. I enjoy acting masculine and I don’t think I’ve ever really felt dysphoric. I had imagined what it would be like to dress as a girl before, but I never put on my mother’s clothes or anything (though I did often fantasize about having breasts).Then, I got iFunny in like middle school, and I don’t know how, but I got into the rp side of it. I started doing rp and went more and more dirty with them until I did dirty rp. I only played women though, never men, rarely non-binary characters. I didn’t think anything of it though and I told no one. I thought it was just some disgusting fetish I had. I did that off and on for years, and I tried dating some men, but in my small town it was hard. When I got to college, I started dating this really cute, masculine presenting, AMAB  NB. We were  in love. They were my partner. I called them my partner, but they called me their boyfriend. It was the first time I’d ever really had the word used on me to the point where I felt like it was an identifier on me. I thought I was just angry that we didn’t call each other the same thing. I was thinking that if I had to call them partner, then they should at least call me their partner as well, instead of making shit unequal and calling me their boyfriend while not letting me call them boyfriend (I never voiced this. I just felt weird every time they would call me their boyfriend). A while after we broke up, I met this girl off of Tinder. She was nice, though when we had sex, it felt weird and terrible and I didn’t like it at all, same whenever we tried to get cute and lovey dovey. I thought it was that I just didn’t like women as much as I thought I had (I’m bi), but I could easily watch straight porn and fantasize. I ended it after a week, because I just felt weird being with a girl that thought of me as some big man who she was supposed to serve in bed and it just felt very heteronormative. I think I just didn’t like the heteronormativity of it, but after some soul searching, I think I just didn’t like being referred to as a boyfriend or treated like a man, yet I had never felt anything really like this until I started actually dating people. I’ve browsed some r/egg_irl stuff and, while some of it is funny and relatable, I don’t know if it describes me. I’m just like, confused as to what my gender is, because I present very masculine, but I don’t always feel like a complete man. Should I like, start acting femme more? Should I just ignore this stuff? Should I talk to someone about this? Maybe it’s just like, a phase, because I’ve never felt this shit before. Also, this is sort of a side note, but I sort of realized this recently. My name is Jonathan, and I’m high school, I was called Krispy by everyone. I really liked this. Every time I hear this nickname, it feels nice, like home. Now that I’m in college, I go by John, because I thought I shouldn’t keep some childish nickname that I had now that I’m an adult. I don’t like that name though. I’d prefer to be Krispy. Also, I’m an actor, and I’ve literally been searching for a name that I like better and that fits me better for years. I thought I was just looking for a cool stage name, since that’s what all many actors go by, but I don’t know if that’s the case anymore. I know this post isn’t written the best, but I’ve just felt really weird about myself recently, and I’m pretty sure it has something to do with gender, and I don’t know why I’m here instead of in r/trans or whatever, but I just need some answers.

I did that off and on for years, and I tried dating some men, but in my small town it was hard. When I got to college, I started dating this really cute, masculine presenting, AMAB  NB. We were  in love. They were my partner. I called them my partner, but they called me their boyfriend. It was the first time I’d ever really had the word used on me to the point where I felt like it was an identifier on me. I thought I was just angry that we didn’t call each other the same thing. I was thinking that if I had to call them partner, then they should at least call me their partner as well, instead of making shit unequal and calling me their boyfriend while not letting me call them boyfriend (I never voiced this. I just felt weird every time they would call me their boyfriend). A while after we broke up, I met this girl off of Tinder. She was nice, though when we had sex, it felt weird and terrible and I didn’t like it at all, same whenever we tried to get cute and lovey dovey. I thought it was that I just didn’t like women as much as I thought I had (I’m bi), but I could easily watch straight porn and fantasize. I ended it after a week, because I just felt weird being with a girl that thought of me as some big man who she was supposed to serve in bed and it just felt very heteronormative. I think I just didn’t like the heteronormativity of it, but after some soul searching, I think I just didn’t like being referred to as a boyfriend or treated like a man, yet I had never felt anything really like this until I started actually dating people. I’ve browsed some r/egg_irl stuff and, while some of it is funny and relatable, I don’t know if it describes me. I’m just like, confused as to what my gender is, because I present very masculine, but I don’t always feel like a complete man. Should I like, start acting femme more? Should I just ignore this stuff? Should I talk to someone about this? Maybe it’s just like, a phase, because I’ve never felt this shit before. Also, this is sort of a side note, but I sort of realized this recently. My name is Jonathan, and I’m high school, I was called Krispy by everyone. I really liked this. Every time I hear this nickname, it feels nice, like home. Now that I’m in college, I go by John, because I thought I shouldn’t keep some childish nickname that I had now that I’m an adult. I don’t like that name though. I’d prefer to be Krispy. Also, I’m an actor, and I’ve literally been searching for a name that I like better and that fits me better for years. I thought I was just looking for a cool stage name, since that’s what all many actors go by, but I don’t know if that’s the case anymore. I know this post isn’t written the best, but I’ve just felt really weird about myself recently, and I’m pretty sure it has something to do with gender, and I don’t know why I’m here instead of in r/trans or whatever, but I just need some answers.

I played Minecraft with a childhood friend and his friends, and during the first voice chat they actually thought I was another boy (to be fair, it was like 2011 we were like 13, and I sound rather monotone).  
Sometimes at home I put my hair together and kinda flipped it over my head so it'd look like I had short hair. I always had long hair, so I had always wondered what that would look like.
So during my teenage years, I had many reasons to not feel as feminine - I had acne, I have excessive body hair (I'm dark haired so it's extra noticeable) and these are things I'm still dealing with.  
But even then I have considered myself a ""girl"" just more ""tomboyish"". I was happy to wear a dress at my sister's wedding, I was excited to wear a dress at my graduation party, and I have some skirts I loved and love to wear.  
I don't know when or how I first heard of the term ""nonbinary"", but I'm sure I hadn't thought of myself back then. I think I really started to question things more around 2017/18, I attended university (I live in Germany), one of the classes being Japanese. There I met people outside the gender-binary and I believe that's when I really got into thinking. But I was still confused, at first I thought I could be trans male, but didn't feel like that fitted completely.  
After some more browsing through the internet (and thanks to reddit), I've come to the conclusion (for now?) that I'm nonbinary.  

I'm still in some halftransparent closet. My twitter and instagram account have they/them in the bio, most of my friends know and have accepted me. However, I haven't come out to my family yet. Both my parents are literally boomers (age wise), and while they don't hate the lgbt, I feel they are highly skeptical of all that. When I first tried to 'sorta' refer to it to my mother, she reacted very negatively (not in a screaming but more 'interrogating' way) and I haven't tried to talk about it again since then. I have talked to my sister about many other things before, but for some reason I just feel nervous to talk about that.

Hey beautiful humans, reading this right now!

So.. The title basically already says it but i am wondering what it's like to be Nonbinary in New Zealand.  
My name is Lou, I'm from Germany and as you probably already guessed, i identify myself as NB (What a surprise xD). I will graduate from school this summer and i'm really thinking about living and maybe even studying abroad for a year. New Zealand is right at the top of my list of the places I want to visit and it has been fascinating me for a long time.

Now the thing is that I'm really worried that identifying as something that isn't male or female isn't generally accepted.. (like.. at all?) in NZ. I mean i know that you will never have a whole country of people that all accept you.. But maybe at least a few? Because one of the reasons i want to live abroad is so that i can start over. That people get to know me, already knowing my preferred name and pronouns (they/them). In german we don't have any gender neutral pronouns and most of the people that know me, know me as girl, call me my Birthname and use she/her.. And as you all probably know best, that really sucks :/

So.. Maybe if you live in New Zealand you could.. I don't know.. share your experience? Or if you know how it is like for other enbies who live there if you're not out? I would really appreciate it!

Thank you so much for your answers and have a great day! &lt;3

2020-03-06 23:00:57,felxn5,3,1,"I talk a lot abt ableism, trans/enbyphobia, &amp; mention loved ones' suicide a ton in this post so just a heads up. I'm also very irritable thanks to another sleepless bought thanks to my insomnia so I apologize if I'm rude or incoherent. I kind of just need a place to unload I guess.

I've only recently acknowledged my gender, so I'm fairly new to the whole nonbinary/trans thing. I'm not familiar with all the lingo and I'm still exploring my identity. But I've been very openly queer since I was a teen and I've always tried my utmost to support my communities. I'm by no means perfect but I'm happy to listen when someone tells me I've done something wrong and I make it a point to apologize, make amends, and rectify my behavior. All I really want is to live happily and see other people live happily as well. I don't EVER want to cause anyone the same pain I experienced growing up somewhere vehemently loathing of queers.

Anyways, that's beside the point.

What's always offended me more than anything else, including the rampant and violent queerphobic rhetoric I encountered from the LDS Church when I lived in Utah, is when people comment on trans and enby's top and/or bottom surgeries with anything less than jubilee.

Like, this isn't something that annoys me like some f*g comment I'll occasionally get from a troll. Calling someone slurs is absolutely wrong and I blame no one for being offended and enraged by it, but I've used social media for as long as I've been openly queer, and at this point, calling someone homophobic slurs just doesn't have the same effect as it used to. It feels more like a kid throwing a temper tantrum. I'm the oldest of three children and my husband has four younger siblings as well, so these kind of things just kind of roll off my back.

For some context, I'm following a medical gore subreddit. My mother was a nurse for years, and she still works in the medical industry as an administrator. She had a ton of anatomy books and medical journals laying around at home for years. I've always been curious so I ended up reading a lot of them and my fascination has continued well into adulthood. I'm by no means an expert in anything. What I know I've overheard from doctors my mother works with. I just liked seeing what everything looked like rather than what it was, how it worked, and what could go wrong.

Occasionally, medical gore will include pictures of top surgery. Top surgery is a wonderful, life-changing event that many trans and enby people have waited their whole lives, from what I've been told, and I believe it. I know a couple of transmen and transwomen who have undergone top surgery and they're more comfortable in their bodies, and that makes me genuinely happy to see them closer to how they picture themselves. One of my very best friends even told me his suicidal ideation decreased significantly once his breasts were removed. He even got to lower his antidepressant dosage and he's doing great.

As I mentioned, it's a huge step, and anything less than jubilee over this momentous occasion just feels wrong. It's very frustrating how many hoops trans and enby folks have to jump through to get surgery, when breast reductions, augmentations, and genital modifications including trimmings and implants are done daily across the world for cis people, but nobody bats an eye. I mean, the shit I've heard that's required for transitioning is ridiculous. Months, if not years of therapy, doctors visits, the struggle to get HRT alone. That's just from professionals. Living in Utah, I encountered dozens of people giving their two cents about how we need to ""respect God's creation"" and the whole biology schpeel I'm sure most of us have had the misfortune of hearing.

I'm sure some of it is necessary. Transitioning is a big deal. But I hear horror stories about how long it takes to get hormones, or crushing news that someone isn't eligible for reassignment surgery, despite the plethora of data showing undeniable correlation between improvement in livelihood after the cause of dysphoria is removed, and I wonder if too many people have their hand in the pot, so to speak. I knew one transwoman before we moved out of Utah who visited not one, not two, but five doctors, for at least six months each, trying to get hormones. She didn't want reassignment surgery. She just wanted breasts and less facial hair. I feel like that's less extreme than reassignment surgery and I still can't reconcile why she had to visit so many doctors for it. She completed suicide in 2018 or 2019 (it's very difficult for me to recall exactly when anything happens) and I wholeheartedly believe the difficulty getting the treatment she needed played a part in it.

It's worse for mentally ill transgender and nonbinary people.

Returning to the medical gore subreddit, which is actually the point of this entire post. Someone posted a picture of their top surgery, and I, like I always do when I encounter these posts, congratulate them. I make the rookie mistake of perusing the other comments and most of them are very kind, curious, and respectful.

And then some clown mentions the poster has a psychotic disorder.

The original poster very patiently explains they're stable, and their gender is in no way influenced by or comorbid with their illness. But, you know, this guy and a couple others can't resist making even bigger asses of themselves with a flurry of thinly veiled transphobic comments, more or less implying that the poster was in another episode, that he was a sideshow act, etc. I'm sure this individual was put through the wringer by doctors because of his completely irrelevant condition as well.

It's infuriating seeing this. Not only is it none of their business to begin with, but they go out of their way to make someone who's just trying to share something wonderful and interesting with people feel bad about themselves.

I had a very good friend not long ago who worked in a jail. There, they were met with all kinds of unsavory characters, including many, many abusive men. A lot of them would call or mail their girlfriends with gaslighting, threats, guilt-tripping, and more. I am astounded by the overlap between trans/enbyphobia and abusive behaviors.

Anyways. I'm done now. I apologize for going on so long. I really appreciate the community here and I hope all of you have a wonderful weekend.",NonBinary,Everyone's a Dr apparently,1583560857.0,"{'created_utc': 1583535657, 'id': 'felxn5', 'num_comments': 3, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'I talk a lot abt ableism, trans/enbyphobia, &amp; mention loved ones\' suicide a ton in this post so just a heads up. I\'m also very irritable thanks to another sleepless bought thanks to my insomnia so I apologize if I\'m rude or incoherent. I kind of just need a place to unload I guess.\n\nI\'ve only recently acknowledged my gender, so I\'m fairly new to the whole nonbinary/trans thing. I\'m not familiar with all the lingo and I\'m still exploring my identity. But I\'ve been very openly queer since I was a teen and I\'ve always tried my utmost to support my communities. I\'m by no means perfect but I\'m happy to listen when someone tells me I\'ve done something wrong and I make it a point to apologize, make amends, and rectify my behavior. All I really want is to live happily and see other people live happily as well. I don\'t EVER want to cause anyone the same pain I experienced growing up somewhere vehemently loathing of queers.\n\nAnyways, that\'s beside the point.\n\nWhat\'s always offended me more than anything else, including the rampant and violent queerphobic rhetoric I encountered from the LDS Church when I lived in Utah, is when people comment on trans and enby\'s top and/or bottom surgeries with anything less than jubilee.\n\nLike, this isn\'t something that annoys me like some f*g comment I\'ll occasionally get from a troll. Calling someone slurs is absolutely wrong and I blame no one for being offended and enraged by it, but I\'ve used social media for as long as I\'ve been openly queer, and at this point, calling someone homophobic slurs just doesn\'t have the same effect as it used to. It feels more like a kid throwing a temper tantrum. I\'m the oldest of three children and my husband has four younger siblings as well, so these kind of things just kind of roll off my back.\n\nFor some context, I\'m following a medical gore subreddit. My mother was a nurse for years, and she still works in the medical industry as an administrator. She had a ton of anatomy books and medical journals laying around at home for years. I\'ve always been curious so I ended up reading a lot of them and my fascination has continued well into adulthood. I\'m by no means an expert in anything. What I know I\'ve overheard from doctors my mother works with. I just liked seeing what everything looked like rather than what it was, how it worked, and what could go wrong.\n\nOccasionally, medical gore will include pictures of top surgery. Top surgery is a wonderful, life-changing event that many trans and enby people have waited their whole lives, from what I\'ve been told, and I believe it. I know a couple of transmen and transwomen who have undergone top surgery and they\'re more comfortable in their bodies, and that makes me genuinely happy to see them closer to how they picture themselves. One of my very best friends even told me his suicidal ideation decreased significantly once his breasts were removed. He even got to lower his antidepressant dosage and he\'s doing great.\n\nAs I mentioned, it\'s a huge step, and anything less than jubilee over this momentous occasion just feels wrong. It\'s very frustrating how many hoops trans and enby folks have to jump through to get surgery, when breast reductions, augmentations, and genital modifications including trimmings and implants are done daily across the world for cis people, but nobody bats an eye.

2020-03-07 05:35:08,feqtjg,0,1,"This is my 24 hour update of being on HRT as a non-binary person. 


• After only 24 hours on HRT although absolutely zero physical effects have taken place I have noticed emotional changes. 


• I have an urge to hug/hold things close to my chest


• and while playing OverWatch I got play of the game as my main, McCree, and called his highlight intro ""aggressive"" and instantly changed it. (mcrees coffin highlight intro) 


since this is my first update I should give a bit of information on myself so you guys get a better idea of who I am and why I'm on HRT. 

Hi, my name is Willow, I am 20 years old. I'm fully out with all of my friends but not with all of my family. I am queer and I am non-binary, AMAB. Before starting HRT I was already quite feminine in appearance. I have a four-year-old pupper and she's the cutest thing in the world, oh, and I started HRT 24 hours ago. 


The reason I started HRT is because I want a softer and less masculine physique and face, actually starting on HRT was surprisingly quick (not much therapy/counseling was needed as I already present and act androgynous or feminine most of the time, but also make the process quicker is that I had spent the last four months doing heavy research on this and so I had an educated answer for (almost) every question they asked) as the country I'm in is incredibly progressive on this. I seriously couldn't be happier with the amount of respect that I was given when I went in for the process of starting HRT. 

My occupation is quite physically demanding however thankfully this hasn't developed very masculine muscles. And if you can't tell by now I'm quite a feminine non binary hooman.

2020-03-07 12:29:30,feuipl,4,1,"i posted this on another sub and i realised its probably worth asking here too, since i’ve had a bit to properly lay out my thoughts so i hope it’s a bit more understandable and not just ramblings and i think it’s probably a good idea to ask nb folk anyway. 

okay so when i was 10 i kinda realised i didnt like being called ‘she’ but i knew at the time that i didn’t want to be a boy. i kinda ignored it for the past 4 years but i’ve now kinda started to really notice that i don’t like being called ‘she’ and it’s annoying me. i don’t really like to be referred to as ‘he’ either (there was a year where i cut my hair really short and i looked like a dude). on discord i’ve asked a couple of people to refer to me by ‘they’ and i feel a lot more comfortable now. 

i don’t know if i get dysphoria but i feel like i’d be more comfortable wearing a binder than not. it’s not a huge thing, i just don’t like my chest that much - in fact really at all. i don’t want to be a guy though. it’s not like i’m a tomboy or anything either - i wear skirts to school, i wear makeup, wear nail varnish, i quite like pastel colours and i have long - ish hair (i want to cut it though). i’m not saying guys can’t like those things, i’m just saying that i am pretty feminine normally (though i like video games, computers and programming). 

also, i don’t know if this is relevant but i’m pretty sure i’m a maladaptive daydreamer and in my daydreams i always prefer to dress more androgynous and i go by ‘they’ in them. just something i noticed but i’m not sure if it means anything. 

i’m going to sixth form (or college, i’m not sure yet) in a couple years and i’m hoping then i can be called by my middle name because i’ve never like my first name. so i think if there’s a time to think about this stuff, it’s now. but part of me feels like i’m just denying that i’m cis, but part of me thinks that i’m nonbinary or something similar. i’m not trying to not be cis, i’m already a lesbianromantic asexual (i’ve known i was attracted to girls since i was 11) so it’s not like i’m trying to be in a community i’m not a part of but it’s just a part of me feels that way. i don’t know. i just feel fake in general. sorry, this got depressing. 

so yeah hopefully this is more coherent than my last post, where i was just rambling and spilling out my thoughts (i mean i still am but it’s just more clear)also, if i am nonbinary, is it possible to still refer to myself as ‘lesbianromantic’?

My 21y/o sibling just came out over the phone to me this morning.

I've read a lot about non-binary people having HRT, and I finally ended up with a ""hormone cocktail"" that seems great to me, but I don't know anything about medicine except the things I read recently, so I would really appreciate the opinion about someone that knows how it works.(I live in France, so basically drugs are free to me :p)

I plan to take :

* Progesterone 200mg/day (every day, taken anally)
* Bicalutamide 25mg/day (one pill or 50mg every 2 days, orally)
* Raloxifene 60mg/day (every day, taken orally)
* Estradiol 0,75 mg/day (every day, transdermal cream)

My goal is partial or full feminisation and de-masculinisation but no breast development. Can I expect that from those drugs ? Is it *relatively* safe ?  
Also, since Bica is known to incluse breast developement and Raloxi blocks it, will it grow at the end ? Would CPA or Spiro be better to block testosterone ?

I really struggle with verbal and written communication, especially when I'm not wholly familiar with appropriate terminology (and I'm still learning.*) Please bring it up if I do so I can correct my words, attitudes and behaviour in future, but please do it a little gently.


I'm a cishet man (almost 29) and in a long term, happy, committed relationship with a nonbinary person born female. We have kids together, a great family life and a strong emotional bond.

However

I am now, and always have been, physically attracted almost exclusively to femme presenting ciswomen. For the longest time, I didn't know that that wasn't who my partner is, so when they came out to me it was a bit of an intellectual and emotional surprise. 

The state of surprise didn't last long, and I've done my best ever since to be as supportive as possible, but I've found that it's difficult to be physically attracted to them on more masculine days. The only way I can think to describe my feelings for my partner is that I love *them,* but I'm attracted to *her.*

I feel guilty as hell about this, like I shouldn't be less attracted to my partner just because it's ManDay. I know in my mind that they are no different now than she was when we met. My brain understands this. My heart understands this. My junk, apparently, does not.

This wouldn't be an issue at all, but I'm aware that I find it difficult to separate physical intimacy from emotional intimacy within a relationship. I find it difficult to be wholly available emotionally without physical intimacy, so if we have a prolonged period of time where my partner's in a more masculine groove then our sex life all but disappears, and as a result our emotional bond gets a little strained, and as my partner gets older they spend more of their time in a manly groove than a girly one - this has become more so since our son was born about seven months ago.

Am I right to feel guilty from y'all's perspective? Is it possible that my sexuality intrinsically precludes my being attracted to my partner's ""him"" or is it more likely to be latent internalised hatred from my time as a super homophobic, super transphobic, super conservative fundamentalist Christian?

2020-03-09 00:17:17,fflxrf,17,1,"Hi all, I'm an AFAB Non-Binary bisexual. My partner is a cis het man. He's only ever identified as such, never questioned it at all until recently. We've been together 7 years as of next month, and I came out as NB almost 2 years ago. He's supportive and happy for me, though suffers some cognitive dissonance on my male presenting days. If, as it is for him, your identified sexuality is based more upon biological equipment than presentation could a heteronormative man being with an AFAB NB still be classed as heteronormativity? 

Is it wrong for me to be angry at those that try to force him into the bisexual box simply because I don't conform to or identify as a binary gender? Why is it that the sexualities of LGBTQIA+ people are allowed a certain amount of fluidity, yet -any- even slight fluctuation (even if it's only temporarily or experimentally) on the part of a person who identifies as heteronormative, confiscates that label from them?

Surely, because I am the only NB person he has been with and it's the exception as opposed to the rule, he can't be gatekept out of the hetero box?

2020-03-09 01:29:44,ffmwxp,5,1,"(Not about sex, just mentions sexual organs so I got nervous and marked as NSFW)

Hi guys, I've never posted here before and just joined, I just wanted to talk a bit (sorry if I shouldn't!).

Recently, I learned that some people have had phalloplasty without getting rid of their vagina (namely chinchillameat), and immediately realized that... well, that's what I've always wanted.

I mean, since before I learned that it was possible, I've always felt dysphoria about missing things vs wanting to get rid of things, and knowing that what little me has randomly wished was possible- just replacing the clitoris with a penis- was... wow, amazing.

The problem is top surgery.

I've hated my breasts for a long time, until a few months ago, when I just... stopped wearing bras.

And immediately I hate them... less.

I mean, I still don't like their size, and it makes me feel... not great with how BIG they are, but... I don't want to get top surgery anymore.

I would rather get a reduction to make them smaller cup than completely get rid of them.

Like, without them being smushed up or held, I would feel like my chest was too flat if they were completely gone. But again, yikes, I hate their size now.

I have therapy in a couple days (and my therapist is transfeminine nonbinary, plus runs a sex/gender diverse help group, so I'll be asking them some questions), but I guess I wanted to see how other nonbinary people felt too, a bit.

Also, my insurance covers HRT and at least Top Surgery, not sure about bottom, so I was a bit sad when I figured out I don't actually want them fully gone and I won't be able to take advantage of my insurance.

I think insurance should cover reduction too, not just ""They're physically too big for your body and hurting your back, so okay fine, we'll pay for it"". Because what about nonbinary folk who don't want them gone, even trans men who want just a little bit left? I dunno.

2020-03-09 13:55:11,ffv08j,6,1,"I'm a (relatively recently discovered) nonbinary writer and I'd really like some opinions on something I've been thinking on regarding representation in stories. 

 When I make trans/nonbinary characters, I have a tendency to make it clear either out of canon (ie mentioning that my tech-y superhero transitioned as a kid, something that never really comes up in canon) or through little details in canon (ie using they/them and 'partner' rather than husband/wife for another important NPC); I think this is a pretty alright way to handle this because gender isn't really a big part of these characters plots. But my question comes with one of my more recent characters. Specifically because gender is a big thing for his plot, but... I don't necessarily want to explicitly state that he's nonbinary. 

He's a teen superhero (go figure, I have a genre) who presents in a pretty genderfuck style and uses he/him pronouns, and he fundamentally goes through an arc of self-doubt regarding whether he should ""pick a side"" and present as entirely masc or fem. Neither makes him happy and he settles on his original presentation. Now, the problem comes in that *I* know he's nonbinary (specifically, that he's bigender), but my cis sister seemed to interpret his arc as him being cis and gnc. Similarly, other trans people I've asked about it and let read about it seemed to get that he's not cis, but every cis person so far's been either confused or assuming the same as my sister. 

I suppose this is where I come to my question- is ambiguity okay? I know the frustration of unclear representation, of being 99% sure that someone *is* nonbinary/LGBT but lacking that 1% confirmation. But at the same time, it frustrates me that I wrote his arc as something (I and other trans people) clearly see as screamingly obvious, but that cis people can't pick up on. I think the core of the matter is that it annoys me that I *have* to state it in order for people to even see it as an option? It's like every character is presumed cis (and straight) until the author comes out and says in-story otherwise. It's the soul of writing, though- I can't control how people interpret my work.

 I'm not even particularly asking about my example- I'd just like to know how people feel about these concepts of representation.

I’ve just got my gc2b binder. It’s one of the half ones, in a medium. 

Tried it on and it feels mostly fine, I can breath alright in it etc. But it’s a little uncomfortable, although I know it is meant to be squishing ya bits down. 

I’m a bit paranoid about doing myself some damage so I’m wondering whether to go up a size. On the one hand, I won’t be wearing it all the time, but also that means that I don’t want it to do anything that’s gonna make it uncomfortable when I’m not wearing it, if you get me???

Does anyone know if going up a size will be worth it?? Obvs there’s no point if it doesn’t bind well and fits weirdly but also I wanna be as safe as I can. I know the binder will likely loosen over time but it’s hard to tell if that will help enough?

2020-03-10 13:01:02,fgdg5p,5,1,"So to start off, there are two things I know for certain:

1. Medically transitioning (MTF) has absolutely been the right thing for me.
2. I am not a boy.

The rest is a bit more up in the air...

I've always wished I'd been AFAB, but even after nearly 10 months on HRT I feel very hesitant to present as a woman. My style is very androgynous, but I don't know if that's because of dysphoria surrounding how things fit, or because that's actually my style. I'm trying to figure out if this is due to internalised transphobia, and fears of ostracisation due to my total inability to pass or if it's actually not right for me? I feel a strong affinity with women, but I don't know if I can ever see myself actually *being* one. Again, I'm not sure if this is due to my own hangups about how society/other women would perceive me or because it's simply not my gender.

I've gone by ""she/her"" pronouns in spaces where I feel comfortable for 6-ish months, but it still doesn't always sit right. Sometimes I'll take a second to realise people are referring to me and often I misgender myself as male in my head. ""He/him"" *definitely* doesn't suit me but I would totally be comfortable with ""they/them"". However, in an ideal world I'd definitely want people to assume my pronouns are ""she/her""?

I think if it turned out I was non-binary, it would feel like a lot of pressure lifted in terms of worrying about how to present myself. But I can't figure out *why* I feel that way. I think it's one of three things, I'm either:

A) a woman that likes to present androgynously. 

B) a woman that is struggling with internal transphobia and hasn't fully become comfortable with her gender yet.

C) a non-binary person that skews towards feminine.

I've felt this way for a while, but just told myself that since transitioning is clearly the right thing for me, my identity will eventually just present itself. But that's not really happening, and while I know it's not crucial to label yourself I would really just like to understand myself a bit better.

This was a spur of the moment ramble, so sorry if it's a bit poorly put together. If anyone's had a similar experience and come to the conclusion that they're NB I'd love to hear from them!

2020-03-10 19:05:02,fgj212,3,1,"First, a little about me. I am 25 years old, I live in the EU, and I was AFAB. However, I would describe myself as a woman (maybe female presenting is a better term?) and use she/her pronouns. Despite this, I have very feminine days and very masculine days. It depends on how I’m feeling in the morning. 

 For my whole life, I have been heavily floating between femininity and masculinity, and after some thorough research and a mind-blowing realization, I have come to the conclusion that I am non-binary....or at least I was until I read so many different definitions of what it means to be non-binary/genderqueer. So I’ve got some questions:

1) What does it mean to you to be non-binary? ( I have read so many different definitions of what it means to be non-binary/genderqueer. As soon as I read one definition and I’m like, “Hell yeah, this is me,” I read another one and go, “Hmmm but that doesn’t quite describe my feelings...” I prefer things to be very straightforward and defined, but this is way more dense than that.)

2) Have you ever worried that if you came out to your friends as non-binary/genderqueer, they would view it as a gimmick or say that, “It’s not real”? (The few friends my introverted self has managed to scrape up are extremely supportive and loving, but I still worry about what they will think.)

3) Attention Non-Binary/Genderqueer People Like Me (i.e. AFAB, female presenting): Have you had issues with people perceiving your non-binary/genderqueer identity as “not as valid” on days when you choose to present as female/femme?

I just had my first appointment with a plastic surgeon about chest/top surgery and it's bringing up feelings that are very hard to deal with. Since age 14, I've had really massive breasts, that fluctuate between 38DDD and 40F depending on my weight. Because of the size of them, my options for surgery are more limited. It kinda seems like there's no way to avoid a nipple graft because of the size of my breasts.

2020-03-12 06:23:53,fhbzfi,0,1,"TLDR; Couples counselor acted off put and questioned me being non-binary and said that I should be able to explain what being an enby means to me in a way that no one can argue that that is me, how do I find that kind of statement? 

I have a personal counselor who is very supportive, understanding, and respectful of me. My partner and I just started couples counseling and I explained that one thing I want to work on is my partner understanding my pronouns of they/them and of met being non-binary in general. 

The couples counselor very quickly said that She doesn’t think I know who am and I reassured her that I do know who I am. She asked what being non-binary meant to me and was taken off guard because I haven’t been asked this before. I explained that I’ve never felt like a female, that generally I’d taken a male gender role as a child but am not male either. I have been constantly discriminated against as well as objectified as my assigned gender, and that I had been gender fluid before I learned what non-binary was. 

I choose gender fluid because I am not a male or female but allowed society to continue to call me how they perceived me while knowing on the inside that I’m not what society says. I also did not know any other term. 

When I discovered what non-binary was, it aligned with exactly how I felt and learned that it is considered transgender. 

Although I knew I was neither of the binary gender, I’m a huge feminist as well as activist for males rights, and the LQBTQ community. This is when she disclosed that she is lesbian and that’s when I put the dots together that she probably wanted me to identify as a powerful woman like herself. I told her that I did know myself, I’m vegan, childfree, pan, and non-binary among other things I identify as. 

Something she did say that has really been getting at me is that “when” I find myself I’ll be able to explain it so that no one can argue with who I am. 

How do you all explain yourself in a way that can’t be question or is it just one of those things where someone will always question it? 

I told my personal counselor about it and that I have felt my identify is question by other because I’ve been growing my hair out (but don’t any more because this subreddit has help me validate that fem or masc presenting doesn’t change being non-binary) and that I felt some gay and lesbian people could be less accepting because I’m in a hetero passing relationship and that bi and pan people seem more accepting. The couple counselor at the end also said that I act the way I do because of my trauma and I felt that was under handed to my gender and sexual orientation.

My personal counselor said based on the little information they knew that it sounded judge-mental and could create a triangle in the couples sessions instead of finding equal ground. 

I agreed with my partner to give the couples counselor one more try and for us to each meet with the couple counselor individually to get to know us better and try a group session again. My partner and personal counselor said that it would be good to decide after the individual session if I would like to try a group session again. My partner really liked this counselor and I don’t so much but want to see if it could work and if the counselor can be accepting and understanding.

2020-03-12 12:45:58,fhfryf,5,1,"I'm several months in to all this questioning at least and in many ways it feels like I've made no progress.

I'm out to my gf as genderqueer and I'm in the process of changing my name. I haven't requested different pronouns from her. I feel unable to, and I doubt it would help anyway (see further down).

I've been triggering more and more male-centric euphoria as I work out my arms and collect what seems like increasing amounts of 'mistakes' from strangers.

I still contemplate taking T, either for say a month to know how it feels and finally know for certain what I would suspect I'd like, or long term. But at the same time, I know that taking it long term would cross a barrier at some point of no return. But the idea of never knowing, of never trying it, feels like a constant bruise that I can't seem to resist poking. There are flashes of euphoria where I catch myself planning post or pre-T vlogs or rants or all the songs I could sing with a lower range. But as I say, I don't have the dysphoria to justify it. To justify the health risks, the social cost. It would be easier if I never felt gender euphoria at all.

I still pack and bind often enough on my days off, even though I often feel hopeless about my gender and give it up. What difference does it really make for me, anyway? I can't even explain why I do it, strong discomfort just isn't a thing for my AGAB, so why? When I can be cis, why not be cis? 

Pronouns still do nothing for me. Well, it's complicated. They/he, when requested like I have with an LGBT group, just make me nervous and suddenly hyper aware of my gender presentation. I get no euphoria from it then, only fear, a desire to continue living and hiding as cis where I don't feel judged on my gender and I know which rules to live by. However, in my day to day life when strangers mistake me and call me 'he', I always feel pleased afterwards. Although in all honesty it has happened often enough that it also kinda just rolls off me as normal, giving me nothing to go on. This is not to say that I pass. I do not pass, certainly not enough for confidence purposes that would allow me to feel safely invisible in male spaces. It just happens now and then that I do get read as male. But if the truth is I'm not a he or a they or a she, what am I? 

What I see in the mirror varies between male (nice, though in reality at best androgynous to anyone else), ugly (in general or as a woman), or weird (nice looking but who is that?). There are days when I see male but I know from others' reactions I'm the only one to see it, so what's up with my brain or eyes? 

Many days I wish for something I don't have. Crippling dysphoria. A sense I am in fact a cis woman. Female euphoria. Peace with androgyny. Certainty. Clearer and more consistent euphoria. A history of noticeable dysphoria going back into childhood. A time before I ever looked into gender stuff online. I have none of these things. I know I'm invalid in this sense, and that it doesn't make sense to make such a big life change with so little to go on. The reality of transition is anything but a dream, and not seeing myself in the mirror barring the occasional trick of euphoria should be a small price to pay for a life of relative safety and ease. I try justify transition, and when others agree it feels too real and I cannot, but when I realise how others must perceive me as exclusively female, or butch female (double cringe) and how I must inevitably die as an old woman and be remembered that way, it feels somehow bizarre and I loop back around again. Transition still tempts me, despite everything. It is endlessly annoying.

They/he, when requested like I have with an LGBT group, just make me nervous and suddenly hyper aware of my gender presentation. I get no euphoria from it then, only fear, a desire to continue living and hiding as cis where I don't feel judged on my gender and I know which rules to live by. However, in my day to day life when strangers mistake me and call me 'he', I always feel pleased afterwards. Although in all honesty it has happened often enough that it also kinda just rolls off me as normal, giving me nothing to go on. This is not to say that I pass. I do not pass, certainly not enough for confidence purposes that would allow me to feel safely invisible in male spaces. It just happens now and then that I do get read as male. But if the truth is I'm not a he or a they or a she, what am I? \n\nWhat I see in the mirror varies between male (nice, though in reality at best androgynous to anyone else), ugly (in general or as a woman), or weird (nice looking but who is that?). There are days when I see male but I know from others' reactions I'm the only one to see it, so what's up with my brain or eyes? \n\nMany days I wish for something I don't have. Crippling dysphoria. A sense I am in fact a cis woman. Female euphoria. Peace with androgyny. Certainty. Clearer and more consistent euphoria. A history of noticeable dysphoria going back into childhood. A time before I ever looked into gender stuff online. I have none of these things. I know I'm invalid in this sense, and that it doesn't make sense to make such a big life change with so little to go on. The reality of transition is anything but a dream, and not seeing myself in the mirror barring the occasional trick of euphoria should be a small price to pay for a life of relative safety and ease. I try justify transition, and when others agree it feels too real and I cannot, but when I realise how others must perceive me as exclusively female, or butch female (double cringe) and how I must inevitably die as an old woman and be remembered that way, it feels somehow bizarre and I loop back around again. Transition still tempts me, despite everything. It is endlessly annoying. \n\nWhat the hell am I doing?"", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Updated thoughts: What am I doing?', 'created': 1584042358.0}"

I came across a tiktok recently, about someone who had been surprised for their birthday and all of their classmates raised money to get their name legally changed (if you know, you know, it was super sweet), and I just got really affected by it?

I've been dating my girlfriend for a few years now. She's just the sweetest person ever, and she's always wanted what's best for me. The thing is, when we first started dating, I identified as male, which has more recently changed to nonbinary. 

I still retain a lot of my previous masculine traits, though. I honestly don't think my identity changed much over the course of our relationship, as much as it was that I found a new way of describing what I felt.

But me and my girlfriend have recently had conversations about this, and she has brought up some concerns. She accepts me fully, and has always wanted me to be the person that I want to become. Still, she doesn't know if she can see herself with a nonbinary person as a lifelong partner, or continuing on with our relationship much longer in the future. Some of her values in life include wanting to marry and have a traditional husband-wife sort of thing, and she doesn't know if my identity really fits with how she sees her future. That's just one example, though.

I'm worried that it's the pronouns and labels that worry her. She doesn't have a lot of background in LGBTQ+ subjects because she comes from a place where it's not taught or talked about so much, and meanwhile I grew up in San Francisco. She has told me that it's kinda hard to understand a lot of the specifics of gender identity, as this is all new to her, which is perfectly understandable. 

I'm just kinda at a loss for what to do. We are still together while we work this out, but none of us really know how to make things better. I really care about her and I want to be able to reassure her that nothing has really changed, and to comfort her. I want to show her that it's okay for me to exist outside the gender binary and that we can still be happy together, which is something I truly believe. But I don't know how to make her believe that.

2020-03-17 02:57:11,fjxute,6,1,"Disclaimer: I'm writing this directly after my work shift while I'm slightly intoxicated. Sorry for bad grammar and such.

Background: I work a low-level retail gig.  I'm not out at work because I live in a state that's harsh on anyone that is even remotely considered trans. However, I am in the process of a name change, for which I thank anyone at my job who uses my correct name. Usually a simple, ""Thank you for remembering my name"" because it positively reinforces them to continue. This has become something of a reflex since I don't want to angrily correct someone at my job, especially anyone in management.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, after that reflexive statement, my nicest manager asked me, ""Are you ever going to tell us why"" I replied, ""Some of it is to heal from childhood trauma"" which is both true and my default answer to anyone I'm never coming out to. 

\- I also added, ""For the other reason, I'm not at liberty to say because of our current political climate.""  I only said this because my guard was down, as this manager is wonderfully nice to me. She's even corrected the other managers over calling me by the correct name. ... She hinted that she understood what I was talking about. She made an analogy that a bag we sell is ""blue,"" but if others found out the bag was ""blue,"" they'd gossip. I nearly cried at the level of acceptance she was giving me. Still, I asked her to keep it between us, ""I know what I just said could possibly answer why, and I ask for your digression"" She said the conversation will be kept between us. This is the first time I've ever breathed a word about being anything other than cis in my place of work. I hope it doesn't come back to haunt me.

Do you have any tips for getting it on and off without hurting your shoulder?

I might wait another month to actually wear it for my shoulder to heal more, but I'd just like to know if anyone's had that issue before, and if wearing a binder in general has made your shoulder worse/more painful from the compression. I think if I can get it on and off without putting pressure on it, it should be fine (I'm not planning on wearing it for long periods or anything right now, just want to try it on).

I tried on a compression bra a few weeks ago and I definitely hurt my shoulder trying to take it off, and my shoulder was a little more sore than usual for about a week.

It happened almost 6 months ago from now and it's only mildly annoying at this point, don't notice it much. Since I didn't get surgery for it (it was like a 2nd degree tear at most probably) I still experience a little bit of tightness/muscle pain around my shoulder and I was just wondering if anyone has dealt with this and also worn a binder.

Do you have any tips for getting it on and off without hurting your shoulder?

I might wait another month to actually wear it for my shoulder to heal more, but I'd just like to know if anyone's had that issue before, and if wearing a binder in general has made your shoulder worse/more painful from the compression. I think if I can get it on and off without putting pressure on it, it should be fine (I'm not planning on wearing it for long periods or anything right now, just want to try it on).

I tried on a compression bra a few weeks ago and I definitely hurt my shoulder trying to take it off, and my shoulder was a little more sore than usual for about a week. The straps on the binder actually look a bit easier to take off than that bra though (gc2b half binder).",NonBinary,Binder and Rotator Cuff Tear (from 6 months ago)?,1584482021.0,"{'created_utc': 1584456821, 'id': 'fk6kv8', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""I was just wondering if anyone has used a binder before after they had a rotator cuff tear?

I’m currently having a hard time deciding whether to stay here or go, since we might be enacting essentially a lockdown of the city. Our state governor is currently against that idea, but that also might change at any time.

I live independently in my own apartment as a grad student. I don’t mind being here by myself. I’m actually enjoying it, really. I’m allowed to work from home and have been doing so, so I have a steady income so far.

I’d feel horrible if I decide to stay here and not go though. My mom worries a lot, and I know she’d want me to go stay with her and my family.  I love my mom and my sisters and I do miss them and I know they miss me too. Problem is that they are the only ones that honestly call me by my pronouns and actual name. It doesn’t matter to my stepdad or extended family on his side. Everyone misgenders me and deadnames me constantly even though I’ve been out for 6 years. They are very conservative and are trump supporters, so I’m terrified to defend myself any time they start talking about anything trans related. I’m honestly tired of being expected to hide how by allowing people to treat me poorly just to make them more comfortable. Hell, my uncle even told my little sister (she’s 7) right in front of me that gender and sex are the same thing and that people who think differently are wrong as if he was trying to teach her to hate me. It’s not like I barely see these people: we are constantly around them. Even being home for a week for holidays just makes me feel like absolute garbage.

Before I’d just ignore it and try not to let it get to me personally. I’m tired of it though. It just makes me feel awful and sad and hurt because these people obviously don’t love or care about me enough to even call me the right name. I used to struggle with depression and anxiety and I have finally gotten to a good place about six months ago. I don’t want to start feeling that way again just because I’d be forced to be around people like that. I haven’t even told them I’m nonbinary. I only discovered that less than a year ago, since I used to think I was trans. I’m never going to tell them I’m nonbinary because getting the binary trans thing is already this difficult.

I think I might be either agender or a demiboy, so I'm trying to see what experience I relate to more.  I'm AFAB and always struggled with being a proper girl, never felt like that fit me, I went through some phases as a kid when I straight out said I was a boy and believed it because I didn't know of anything outside of the binary. 

Now I know I'm nonbinary (even if a small part of me is still in denial), and I prefer neutral pronouns and titles like they/them and Mx, but at the same time I get euphoria from some masc terms (like when someone calls me a boy I just get this surge of joy?) and I'd definitely prefer to be clocked as a guy than a girl, but like, a pretty guy instead of a hypermasculine one. I'm confused because I know I'm not a man, but I've always identified with the masculine side of things more, and since I was a kid I always said I wish I was AMAB instead, and a part of me wonders if I even would have had this gender crisis if I had or would instead have just been a more feminine boy.

I get that. This is a rough topic that hits close to home for a lot of people. I just had some stuff I wanna get off my chest.

So I'm AMAB, 22, and I've been lurking around here for a while. I posted some stuff a while ago about how I was wondering if I was nonbinary. I'm still wondering, but I'm pretty sure that I'm at least not cis, and probably nonbinary or agender or gender fluid or something. Nonbinary is nice I guess, I'm still working on it. But basically I've been realizing I'm not cis, and probably nonbinary, which has been weird, especially since I keep doubting myself, even though I think it's becoming more apparent that this is reality, yadda yadda yadda. I mean come on, I wanna wear punk rock outfits and cute dresses. And androgynous stuff is friggin cute I love it. I wanna be cute. It would be nice, now and then.

But to add a whole 'nother level of compleity on top of that, I am also a Mormon. Not like, forced to be a Mormon, or like I'm a half-hearted Mormon, no. I consider myself to be pretty invested in my religion, and stuff. (Not from Utah by the way. I'm from the east coast originally, and grew up in a pretty liberal family) It's part of me. It's foundational. I'm aware of the problems my church has, and I have kind of learned to just roll my eyes a little bit. Only so much I can do, right? I try to not let uninformed church policy get in the way of my relationship with God, or in the way of what I know to be good and true, like LGBTQ stuff, and the like. I've been an ally for a really long time, and all that, you know?

But now I realize that I'm one of the people my church doesn't acknowledge. And I know if I try to transition in any way, there will be some consequences. In some ways I've kind of accepted that. Like, it's not going to stop me, but it still doesn't feel great. It's depressing to know that my church doesn't think that what I'm going through is real, or worse, that it's a trial that will be washed clean in the afterlife. Like, no. I am what I am. Don't try to take that away from me.

Trying to work through that has been hard, but I don't feel like I'm alone. I know this might sound silly, but, there have been times during this period of soul searching where I've felt lots of comfort, love, and solidarity, from somewhere else. Maybe that sounds like spiritual nonsense and mumbo jumbo, but I know what I've felt. I've felt it many times before, asking for help and receiving answers and comfort. It's something I never want to abandon or dismiss. And I believe that being in my church has been what has helped me feel it most strongly. I know it to be true.

So, I'm going to try to stay in the church no matter what. Just as an act of defiance. To say I'm not going away or caving to what the church want from me. I'll do that until I can't anymore, which I hope is never. I wouldn't be ""kicked out,"" so to speak, not with the most recent change in church policy (which, while still problematic, is a *major* upgrade from what it used to be). But like... I don't know, it's hard. I don't know how to reconcile this. I feel like I'm going to need a lot of soul searching to figure this out.

I'll be quick, I was born a female but i've never conformed to social rules. I've always been a ""Tomboy""

But now It's time to question my gender.

I really like clothing of both genders (Altough to me clothes have no gender) And I like going by She/Them pronouns. I feel comfortable on the non-binary label and I would like to have the body of a twink while still having my female genitalia.

But I can't help but invalidate these feelings, I feel like I'm just a cis girl, but in reality I don't feel 100% cis.

I also don't experience hate torwards my body because I'm mostly ""OK"" with it. And that's what makes me doubt the most altough i'd like to have a male body form the genitals up.

If any of you happen to see this and either work for or know of some company that would be looking for these skills please feel free to comment on this post or dm me.

I'm AFAB, but I've never really strongly identified with my gender, or any gender. I didn't really realise some things though, until I deconverted from my religion in September, and began to take a more critical look at what I believed and how I felt about myself.

My problem is that I don't struggle with any kind if dysphoria, I just don't identify with anything other than being me. When I look in the mirror I see somebody who's passionate, loving, determined, etc. I've never had any body image issues. I've never searched out the flaws in my appearance or tried to change how I look to be more attractive, because I just don't see myself that way. I don't see a body I see a person. With myself and others. I've always seen people long before I pay attention to their appearance. 

I just feel like embracing the non-binary term would be taking away from people who's experience is harder than mine, who struggle, etc.

I'm also not sure I'm comfortable with they/them, or wanting to present differently. I'm fine with dressing conventionally(partially, anyway) and sticking with the feminine pronouns. But, that once again feels like I might invalidate others who have dysphoria and that can be triggering...

(CW: I’m going to talk a bit about self harm and dysphoria) 

For the past couple of days I’ve been kinda off, I have anxiety and it tends to build up over time and reach a tipping point where I usually experience panic attacks and that combined with my dysphoria at the moment has been difficult. I’m afab and my main source of dysphoria has always been my chest, usually I just feel distressed or disgusted by their... presence and I usually just feel shitty about it and try to ignore it but sometimes I get worried that I’m not dysphoric enough and I push it or I’m reaching my anxiety tipping point and it sets me off, either way I always get a panic attack and recently I’ve started cutting again. I cut for two years and then I had an incident where it went too far and it was a whole thing with my parents so I tried to quit and I was pretty clean for the next two years with maybe 3 or 4 minor relapses. This year, within the part 3 months I have had 4 relapses. I know that if I try to tell my friends or family or my therapist that it will cause others pain and I’ll be putting them through all of this shit again but I’m worried that if I don’t get it outside of my brain that it’s just going to get worse. I relapsed last night after I tried wearing a sports shirt in the shower to help with the heightened dysphoria, it made it so much worse and I just got out and did it but it wasn’t as mild as the last 3 and that scared me and I don’t know any other way to explain it but it felt like that my anxiety on tipping point was just vining in the point or extending it idk. I felt numb and shakey and I couldn’t stop thinking about how trapped I feel within this body and how fucking suffocating it is to have other people look at you like your someone else and when you try to get some sort of piece of mind like through binding or talking about medical transition, your name, your pronouns or having to try and fail to explain dysphoria in a way that they can understand the absolute fucking weight of the feeling, it just makes them uncomfortable and they don’t talk to you. I’m so scared that I’ll never be able to be myself or that when I do everyone I love will leave me. I skipped school today so that I could try to control my anxiety before everything gets bad again and it didn’t really work, I was home-alone for most of the day so I was able to feel comfortable as myself and I even felt good enough to wear some eyeliner and then my family got home and they knew I was not having a great time so they tried to make me feel better by saying the makeup suited me and the snow jumper I was wearing was like my new home but it just began to build everything up again. My dad got home and he’s not really on board with my name yet so he calls me by my old initials which used to be fine but it just reminds me that at one point the way I lived and the way other people saw me was wrong for lack of a better word, I can’t stand the thought of how I used to look and that name and just everything and every time he uses that reference to my name it reminds me of how much my transition has and will take.

I know my question sounds weird.

I always felt a bit like an outcast.
Two years ago I discovered, that I am pansexual.
And a few months ago I watched a series about a nonbinary person and I started questioning my own gender.
I never really liked it when someone said that I'm  a girl or referred to me as 'she' but I don't know if that are signs? I never had the feeling, that I was a girl but I don't feel like a boy either.

2020-03-21 08:35:11,fmby5a,0,1,"Dear R.,

There are approximately 1,010,300 words in the English language, but I could never string enough words together to properly explain how much I love you. I dislike it when people say, “I love you,” to a person they barely know, but I have the confidence to say that phrase to you and mean it with my heart and soul. Everytime I talk to you, your sweetness seems to melt my heart away as if it were a chocolate sculpture in the heat. I constantly worry about and miss you whenever I miss the chance to talk or when I see you looking down or sick or whatever. I wish I lived closer so I could run to you anytime you feel sad, but also give you all the space when you need it. Ever since I started talking to you, something felt different inside, I don’t know why, but I felt as if I could instantly trust you, even though I have major trust issues.

I know we haven’t been talking that long, but I want to know you better, as I’m sure you feel the same, and get to stand beside you and be there for you to lean and fall on when you feel weak. We will take it as slow or as fast as we need to, especially for you. I don’t want to rush it. I want you to be comfortable and be able to show me your weaknesses and strengths. I want you to be able to have freedom, I’d hate to constrict you. I want to see your comely smile, and stare deep into your eyes that twinkle like sparkling cyder. I want to hold you when you are down, and cuddle when times are up. I understand it’s a lot to process in a short period of time, and that there are reasons holding you back from going out with me, but you’ve touched me in a way that no one has ever before. 

Ever since I’ve met you, I’ve felt happier, giddy, and even flustered. I’ve felt tears for you, and tears of joy from talking to you. You make me have a little more faith in this cruel world.  At the moment I’m writing this I’m currently thinking about you and how I hope you’re safe in your bed, sleeping well, and having only the sweetest, happiest dreams. I know that it might have been tough for you that day, but I will always be here for you, and I know that you’ll make it through these tough times, and that you will come out with the biggest smile because of all the amazing achievements that you got from all the trials that you conquered. 

I felt instantly depleted of my strength when you answered the Tell saying that we were friends, I mean I love being friends with you because you are amazing, but I really yearn to be more. I know that there are reasons that you wouldn’t date me, mainly that you said that you can’t handle a long distance relationship anymore; however, I hate to see you cry and be unhappy, and I would travel as much as I can to see you, even if it’s just for a day. Sadly, it’s not a possibility yet, due to lack of transportation. Remember, “if you change your mind, I’m the first in line, honey, I’m still free, take a chance on me, if you need me let me, gonna be around, if you got no place to go, if you’re feeling down, take a chance on me, take a chance on me!” haha. Anyways, I just want to ask you one simple question. 

Will you, R.S., go out with me?

Sincerely and With Love,

Val K.

2020-03-21 14:03:01,fmff8e,12,1,"Hey everyone, 
Does anyone else feel that the trans/nb culture is scarily image obsessed? I know our body image is a big part of gender expression, and coupled with the current era of social media that's inevitably leading to hyperfocus on image. I just feel... Really uncomfortable about that. This is just my personal opinion. 

There's a difference between sharing the odd picture and spending time each day trying to achieve the perfect pose, and posting to social media and waiting for the validation in comments and likes. 

I have a person close to me that is like this, and it worries me. She focuses so much on what the internet says instead of me/friends telling her to her face she is beautiful and wonderful. She might complain that no one has responded to her latest outfit post, yet I've mentioned it multiple times in real life. That is just one example. As the validation or perceived invalidation continues, it just reinforces her belief that her image has to be perfect at all times and is the basis of her self worth. She was never like this when we met, but as she came out and transitioned, it grew and grew. Now she has a following and other online trans friends, it's become so important to her. They are all the same, relying heavily on social media for validation, and constantly posting selfies on multiple social media platforms, group chats and discord servers, and waiting for the attention. Aside from the person in my life, every single one of these other trans and nb people are the same. Gender is more than an attractive picture. Our lives and souls are more than a picture. 

This mindset really scares me. People ignoring the many complexities of life as a human, connection and relationships in favour of this one single thing. I understand, trust me I do understand the need to be perceived a certain way - I am nb and have big image problems - but the answer is not to do this. In my view, the answer is further away from that. I am more than my body, I'm more than my image, more than what people might desire of me sexually. I've been running away from beauty culture, body image perfection culture, diet culture, makeup/clothing/nails culture my whole life. Feeling like I had to be a certain way. But then I enter this world thinking were all finally allowed to be free, to be weird, to be unique and original. And I find image after image of people looking the same or trying to look the same. Very little discussion or text, just images.

On the one hand I want to come out, I want to be able to ask everyone to use they them pronouns, I want to be openly non binary and stop pretending to be a girl. On the other hand I am afraid, I'm going to have to explain my gender to people over and over again, I'm going to have to constantly correct people on pronouns, I'm going to have to face people confronting me about my gender and telling me I'm wrong and I'm afraid of all of that. 

As I mentioned previously I work in a very supportive environment and I'm expecting the reaction to be confusion and acceptance, they will all be fine I'm sure but it will take them some time to get used to they/them pronouns and gender neutral language. 

My biggest worry is coming out to my church. I am expecting a lot of them to have a similar reaction to my work colleagues, not know what it is and take some time to get used to pronouns ect but accepting. 

I'm also expecting a few to not really accept and understand it but still act loving towards me, they will think it wrong and pray for me to be 'saved' but be genuine in the attitude of loving everyone and will still treat me as part of the church family. I do have my issues with this mindset, but I think it's important to make the distinction between Christians who act like this in a genuine way and Christians who are abusive and antagonistic towards the LGBTQ community.

And of course there will be those that will not accept it or me in anyway. I'm expecting these people to be fairly passive aggressive with it and they will probably make some complaints to the higher ups.

The other interesting thing about this situation is that the my parents are the ministers at my church, this affects a few things. My parents are in a position where they love and accept me and are trying to understand it but are struggling to. The thing is that we are not sure what the reaction will be from above my parents and what they will be officially asked to do as church leaders, my mum is trying to find this out but it's taking a while. The other thing that worries me is that those that disapprove are likely to give my parents more grief than me and will complain about my parents to others, it could make their lives very difficult. 

If you made it though that, thank you. The point of this post is to ask if anyone has been in a similar situation and what happened if you came out?

2020-03-23 03:27:04,fnd4ik,12,1,"I recently started talking to an afab enby that I met at a local gaming store. We had met up as friends a few times and I felt like there was something more. So after talking to some of you I got the courage to ask them if our planned movie night/ sleepover at their place was a date. They got totally flustered but said it could be if I wanted it to be, if I was interested. So after talking about how we both felt we agreed to make it a date!

We started out the night keeping a friendly distance apart, buying junk food and getting high on the way back from the grocery store. We got back and started watching movies, both of us making timid movements towards each other until we touched and held hands. Which progressed into cuddling by the time we were into our second movie. Things were going amazing at this point, we were having a blast and both digging the physical closeness. 

The whole time I was thinking I'd never felt so comfortable being who I am with someone before. I don't feel like I have to play any sort of gender role around them, I'm able to express myself in a way that is true and real. 

By the third show it was 1AM and I was getting pretty sleepy, I let them know that I was ready to go to bed. So we shut off the TV and brushed our teeth then crawled into bed. I was about to turn off the lights when I remembered I needed to take my bra off. I had meant to take it do it in the bathroom and then put my shirt back on, but now I was already under the covers and didn't want to get out just for that. So I kinda turned away, slipped off my shirt and bra then laid down quickly trying to cover up. I HARD FAILED, my left boob close to them was showing when I looked down &gt;&lt;. By then it was too late so I looked over at them and saw they were looking. I made a bold move and uncovered the other then looked at them again. Oof, their eyes were wide hahahaha, So I moved onto my side and got closer to them moving in for our first kiss after which I said, ""You can explore if you want to"".

What ever doubt and trepidation about what was going on between us melted at that point. We kissed   a few times passionately before they pushed me back gently and put their hands on me. Running their fingers over me in a way that really solidified a lot of things about my body in my mind. It allowed me to be more confident about the changes I've been going through with HRT and experience sensations and feelings I'd be wondering about. I didn't expect that going into it but I love and appreciate my body even more now.

Things got pretty intense for an hour with kissing, touch and breast play but went no further. That felt like a good place to end at that night, and we were both more than happy. We fell asleep in each others arms and stayed that way until the morning light woke us up. Just when I thought this perfect time couldn't get better, we had some spontaneous gentle touching before they had to get ready to go to work. It was so perfect and it's all I could have ever hoped for and more. I know we didn't sleep more than 5-6 hours but I woke up feeling like I had gotten a full nights worth. 

I feel like I've come out of it refreshed and full of renewed confidence that I made the right choice transitioning. Saturday and Today have been the first days I really felt like I'm a Demi-girl. I really hope that this feeling doesn't go away because I'm loving it.

We both agreed we want to take it further from here and see how things are when we both aren't being so timid. We're making sure to found this relationship on things besides physical contact and sexual attraction. We're good friends and neither of us want to lose that if this romance doesn't work out.

2020-03-23 04:01:29,fndkvp,7,1,"I’ve been doing some self-exploration over the past few months and have begun heavily questioning whether or not I may be nonbinary. I guess it would be good to finally gather all my thoughts into one place. 

I was born female and I feel a significant disconnect with my sex. If I had the choice, I would have been born as something else, but I’m not sure what, because my ideal body does not align with what it’s possible to be born as. Ideally I could get sterilized then have a hysterectomy to remove my uterus and ovaries, then surgery to remove my breasts and possibly nipples as well. I have always felt terribly disgusted by my body’s capability to reproduce and am frequently uncomfortable with the presence of my sex organs. I also greatly dislike the shape of my hips, but that seems unalterable. I otherwise don’t think there’s anything wrong with my face or hairstyle, both of which are very feminine in appearance. In short, I wish I could have a pretty face with a sexless body. So I guess that would make me nonbinary.

Between the ages of 14 and 15 was when I began noticing that I felt like something was wrong with my sex. I would have random but frequent strong urges to cut my developing breasts off because I hated them and wanted to keep my flat chest. This feeling deteriorated over time, and I’m not sure if I naturally became used to my adult body or if I was forcing myself to enjoy being female. It was also around this time when I began thinking that it could be nice to start being referred to as gender neutral pronouns, something I never told anyone else about. It’s weird to look back on, seeing as at the time I was barely familiar with trans topics.

These days I occasionally feel some mild discomfort at being called “she”, and much more noticeable discomfort at being called a woman. Internally those words make me cringe. For a long time I worry that I’ve been forcing myself to be a woman because I thought I had no choice otherwise, and it’s becoming more and more exhausting. I think I’d prefer to be called “it” rather than “she” or “they”, and certainly not “he”. The thought brings me comfort.

I accept the possibility that I could be wrong, of course. The idea of making significant changes to my body is daunting, which is why I don’t think anything is set in stone yet. I’m also an abuse victim who would desperately like to move past several traumatic or painful experiences from different points throughout my life. I’ve faced an embarrassing amount of sexual harassment and misogyny since the age of about 10. I understand that these problems may have some influence over my feelings, and I don’t know if I should consider that they negate everything I said above or if they’re only accelerating the feelings that already existed.

I  have certain memories from when I was with my ex that cause me so much  unbearable dysphoria. He wasn't supportive at all when it came to me  identifying as nonbinary. Worst of all, he would pressure me to expose  my chest(I'm afab) to him during sex. This is really difficult for me to  even think about but the worst incident was a time when we included my  roommate in sexual activities. I don't regret involving my roommate  because he is my friend and I trust him. What I regret is letting my ex  pressure me into taking my binder and bra off during this. (Warning:  this will get a little explicit) My roommate was sitting next to us on  the couch touching himself as my ex was about to go down on me; at this  moment he started to pull off my sports bra. I kept pushing his hands  away and mumbling no. We were all pretty intoxicated and having fun and  stupidly, I didn't want to ruin the moment by making my roommate feel  uncomfortable. He had forced my bra off many times during sex before so I  eventually gave in and let him pull it off. I tried to just block out  my extreme discomfort. What bothered me the most was having my roommate  see my chest. The dysphoria was just killing me.

I  was so drunk that I can't even remember if I ever managed to put it  back on at on at any point. I told myself that I would never again make  sexual decisions like while intoxicated. Ever since this night I'll just  randomly get flashes of what happened and it just makes me want to die.  I have mild tourettes and whenever I get a flashback of that moment it  triggers tics. Sometimes I just have to scream while driving whenever I  think about it. I'm so angry at him and at myself. I feel so fucked up  about this. A couple weeks later I eventually was able to bring this up  to my roommate and to my relief he said that he noticed this too and  that it really bothered him. I don't blame him in any way for not  speaking up because at the time, I was pretending I was okay. It's not  his responsibility to speak for me. My roommate has one of the most  supportive people in my life when it comes to my gender identity. He was  also the first person to ever ask me my preferred pronouns and to use  them. Something my ex never did for me.

This all happened about a year ago and it's still killing me inside. I wish I could just forget this never happened but I can't.

We  were together for a year and a half. Throughout our relationship, my ex  would pretend that he supported me by saying vague things like ""I don't  understand it but you do you."" ; then he'd turn around and say that he  couldn't be with me if I got top surgery. I always reminded him that  it's not an ""if"" but a ""when"" I get my top surgery. He'd say that my  chest is what he found most attractive about me. He's bisexual and would  make remarks like ""I'm attracted to men who are masculine and women who  are feminine"" and would just ignore the fact that I was nonbinary. Not  only did I try to have open communication with him about what being  nonbinary means to me but I would also send him educational links on the  subject. Even though I kept reminding him how much it would mean to me  if he would just read some of the simple short articles that I sent to  him; he kept just nonchalantly saying that he never read them. I didn't  badger him about it but would just casually bring it up here and there.  I've beaten myself up time and time again for ignoring the warning signs  and putting up with this bullshit.

I've  been suicidal for most of my life but these memories are just making it  even harder to sleep at night and wake up everyday.

For me, part of being non-binary is feeling like I exist in the in-between and/or that I can move. Gender for me is this ever mutating blob.   Anyway....

I also am a death worker...Or death doula.  (I like death worker more, but death doula is much more commonly known).  I often feel that part of my gender magic is that I can move between the worlds, or support others as they move between. It has been the case for many years, and I have had the honor and privilege of being there for many at end of life. 

Anyway, I am wondering if there are any other enbies who do this work or feel called to this work?

2020-03-24 10:19:19,fo2ses,2,1,"So, I have four younger siblings. 2, 8, 10 and 14. Youngest is half sibling with dad and stepmum. 8 and 9 are stepsiblings and the 14 year old are 100% biological. Therefore only one who has to see bio mum. Thank god. 

The 14 year old came out the other day. I am so so so happy for them. They gave me preferred pronouns (they, them in English, de and hen in Norwegian) and new name (Robin) they want to try out.

Dad, me and stepmum must admit we weren't exactly very surprised. Both me and stepmum are pansexual and stepmum messes around with gender expression a bit so we sorta had already guessed. Was just waiting for them to say it. Dad was also really happy that they felt safe enough to come out. 

Bio mom will be a bit harder not cause she is technically a bigot but because she is very ""accepting"" and ""cool"" and ""good mother"" and ""supports LGBTQ+"" so ""it's fine to make jokes"". She pretends to be supportive depending on who she is with. Secretly a massive Swerf. Bit of a Terf as well but she doesn't speak about that around us cause we get so pissed off. Her Swerf news are a new discovery for us. Just sort of to give you humans an image of her. 

Also I sort of experimented with gender and identified as genderqueer a while at 14-16 but bio mum got mad when I wore a sportsbra (wasn't allowed to get a binder even if I was to pay for it myself), told me ""you already don't like how chubby you look, this just makes that worse"". Dad and stepmum called me their son from time to time and I enjoyed that a lot. 

To Mum's LGBTQ+ friends she acted super supportive and sort of showed me off. But when her not LGBTQ+ friends were there she made fun of me and the terms etc. Along with other behaviour at that time I gave up and now trying to identify as genderqueer or anything just gives me flashbacks and anxiety so I've given up. 
I'm really scared that's going to happen with Robin. I want this to be a positive experience for them and not something traumatizing. I don't want them to end up not feeling like they can identify as NB because of bio mum. I don't give a single fuck if they identify as a male, or female or genderqueer or something else in the future. Shit changes and sometimes one has to experiment but also wouldn't be surprised if they identified as NB forever. 

They have told me they are worried cause Robin remember how she treated me. I've gives some arguments for if/ when she does the ""it's a phase"" thing (That if it is or isn't is irrelevant, that's how they feel right now and it costs zero kr to respect their kid). 

Also their birthday is in a few months. I'm buying flag and pins and nail colour in NB colours+ their favourite colours. And have told my bf (after asking Robin ofc) so he doesn't use wrong name or pronouns. But all the NB merch in the world won't stop the trauma of bio mum being an ass. Any idea what I can do?

I am a non-binary fashion stylist and I'm working on a project to develop a workshop-style curriculum to help people working to explore their gender identity with the help of fashion and beauty professionals. If you've got time, I welcome any willing participants to take this survey! [https://forms.gle/4PvXiHgcRmEjcskU7](https://forms.gle/4PvXiHgcRmEjcskU7)

The answers from this survey will be analyzed to design resources and provide information for trans, non-binary, gender non-conforming, etc., individuals, to provide safe access to community-oriented support of gender exploration and expression processes, through free workshops (and hopefully someday a clothing bank) led by fashion and cosmetology professionals geared toward self-affirmation and empowerment through external signaling and presentation.

The aim is to be able to educate, inform, and demonstrate how a person may explore their gender with reference to their own proportion, features, desired state of being, etc. Some will want to stand out, some will want to blend in, some will want to appear more masculine, some for feminine, some without gender and some fluctuating in between. 

We want ALL of those people to be welcome and take away helpful information. 

I will preface this by saying, much of this may feel redundant. I encourage you to answer as many questions as you are able, with as much detail as possible. The questions are intentionally broad, there are no wrong answers and no required answers. If you're well along your journey to complete gender confirmation, but happen to be taking this survey, please impart your experiences both past and present.

Please be as specific and candid as you are able, if that includes indicating your ethnicity, physical characteristics, transition status, etc., please provide whatever information you feel comfortable sharing that may be relevant to your experiences.

I know I still have plenty of time, that's ok, but it's kinds frustrating not knowing certain stuff about yourself.
Lots of details in my life point out that I'm a trans guy, but I don't think so. I don't know. My whole life I was like ""I read some trans guy/nb person experience who is exactly like this! ...but I'm still a gal. Me? Trans? NB? How silly"" but. Wow. Sometimes.

For example, when I was a kid (like 5/6 years old) I was already sick of gender stereotypes and I thought that being a man would be so liberating, so I used to say ""When I grow up I'm gonna have an operation and I'll become a man!"" (I pictured myself as King Africa because I was obsessed with that man). I didn't want people to see me as weak, I hated pink, Barbies... 

I really REALLY liked the boy's section in clothing stores (2000s female fashion has always looked horrendous to me) and felt extremely uncomfortable with girl's clothing.

Then I was maybe 10? And my chest started to grow. I was terrified, I even remember myself feeling it was a traumatic experience. ""Fuck, I'm a girl, I didn't remember"" I used to think, ""Now the boys will treat me different, I won't be able to change clothes with them after gym"". My mom made me wear a top (sometimes I would ""forget"" to wear it) and I'd feel so SO EMBARRASSED when we went to buy them.

Years passed (I won't talk about my teenage years so this post doesn't look like an encyclopedia, I'll just say that I learn to love pink and more ""girly"" stuff), I'm now almost 23. When I think about romantic attraction and I think if girls would like me I always think ""nah, sapphics only like girls... Wait, I'm a girl, why did I forgot?"". It's so weird.

Also I've been thinking about reducing my chest for years now (they're huge and heavy, also they're a pain to find clothing sometimes and my back hurts). But, here's the thing, a body can't take two reduction operations, right? What if I'm ok with small chest now but in the future I want to remove them completely? 

Look, it's even weird for me to write ""I'm a gal"", but it's even weirder to write ""I'm a boy, I'm agender"". But some days I'm ok with she/her pronouns! Some people told me I could be genderfluid/genderflux and maybe it suits me but not completely? I don't know how to feel.

If you read all of this, my gosh thank you so much, you're an absolute angel!! And sorry for my English, is not my first language!

2020-03-25 00:16:07,fogh6m,2,1,"I am a 24M and I've recently begun to embrace my feminine side more directly, not only to bring those qualities out but to also enhance my more masculine qualities. The journey to getting here is a mix of the usual and unusual. Since I was young, the regular cultural fantasy of rescuing a damsel in distress never did much for me emotionally, I always thought the idea of being rescued by a strong woman to be more appealing. I have frequently crushed on tomboyish girls and women. I was not-infrequently slurred by idiots growing up about being perceived as not ""male"" enough. My mom also once half-joked that it might have been better if I had been born a  lesbian.

However, what led me to finally deal with this issue directly was a combination of two major factors. The first is my own spiritual journey and study of religion. I  have gravitated to a number of traditions, Taoism, Kabbalah, Advaita  Vedanta etc. that emphasize a balance between the masculine and feminine. This is a complex topic so I'll just say that this is a big part of what has pushed me into embracing my femininity. The other thread is Anime from, Avatar: The Last Airbender (yes I consider it anime) to Revolutionary Girl Utena which served as the tipping point for me.

After a brief time looking up gender concepts on the internet, I would be most comfortable describing myself as masculine leaning androgynous, though I'm perfectly comfortable sticking with male pronouns and identifying as male with most people unless further explanation was needed or I became close to them. I know the term demi-male exists but I tend to prefer Androgyne,  probably because like man or woman, it is an old concept that has an attached myth structure that helps orient me.

So what am I doing? Well, my first steps involve my exterior look, I'm growing my hair out a bit more, shoulder-length at most but we'll see.  I've tried shaving most of my body hair and while I like it, it is a  pain in a lot of ways so I am going to be trying Veet next, will try and look into similar products made for men, but my grocery store just had the stuff for women. I also want to take better care of my hair and skin to be as soft and smooth as possible, but I know next to nothing about this beyond ""use moisturizer"". I'm also thinking about how I dress, I  value comfort a lot, but that has led me to wear a lot of stuff that is rather drab. It comes off less like I'm mixing both masculine and feminine together and more like neither is there. Think lots of sweat pants and hoodies. I've also been working out a lot for the past year  and I've gotten a bit more muscular. I've decided though I don't want to focus on getting bigger and bigger but to try and get toned.

Not much else to say for now since I've said a lot, and my more internal emotional work is a lot more complicated. **Any advice, insight or general thoughts you can give are most welcome!**  I also apologize if I said anything upsetting, I am very new to all this and I know I am bound to make mistakes based out of ignorance but I  do want to learn.

Nonetheless there are a lot of times when I feel like I want to look, present, and feel more feminine.

Top surgery
Pros: no more chest dysphoria, could be shirtless in public/outdoors, not have to bind anymore! Cons: could regret it, and decide later in the future that something there could be nice. I’d look a lot younger which is an issue professionally, and be shown less social understanding for having the procedure.

So, I came out to pretty much everyone, including my grandmother, as pansexual a few weeks ago. I have also come out to some of my closer friends as genderfluid (AMAB) (I'm not certain exactly where I fit here, I usually settle somewhere non-binary, but with fluctuations between male and demi-girl). All people involved in both of these were supportive and amazing. Pretty much the only people I haven't told, however, are my parents.

My parents aren't homophobic, as far as I can tell, but they seem to misunderstand the concept of gender. I don't think they'd be phased by me being pan (though they may not see the differences to bisexuality), but revealing my genderfluidity seems more daunting. I've set myself semi-deadlines (semi because quarantine) for both, so I can't back out. The way I've done this is that some friends are going to take me shopping for some more feminine/androgynous expressing outfits once this situation dies down, and my parents will definitely question that (genderfluid deadline), and also the fact that I'll be bringing a boy to my senior prom (pan deadline).

With all of the pretext out of the way, what are some suggestions you guys may have about how I could come out to my parents? I kind of want to come out about both at once. I know to expect questions. What scenario should I try to construct?

2020-03-27 18:24:16,fq2fo9,8,2,"Hey everyone, I am finally actively trying to find a new name. I have been transitioning for several years now, and always avoided my name. But now, I kinda need a new name out of safety. I ""pass"" as ""not a woman,"" but then, my name outs me. I am about to graduate college and look for careers so getting a neutral name is important to me. 

It has taken me so long to consider changing my name because my name is special to me. I love it a lot, and in a perfect world I would keep it, but it is a feminine name. Likely no matter what I choose I will still let close friends and family call me my birth name. 

In some situations I go by Danny, which is a nickname.

   I'm  facing the problem of not wanting to 'section' myself off from  non-transgender people (and become a sort of transgender fascist) yet  feeling like I realize they don't respect me at all. Even if they do  acknowledge its validity, they would use my dysphoria as an easy target  to bring down my self esteem. It seems to be that a lot of left-leaning  cis people will simply publicly state they support transgender because  that's what they 'should' do, even if in reality they don't. Some cis  people seem to think 'Oh yea I, really identify as the opposite gender,  too, because we're really all one. I'm just not a slave to being called  that, therefore I'm superior to you. You just don't love yourself and I  do. That's your problem.' That's actually what one of my former 'cis  friends' said to me.

this is different from a trans girl because a trans girl identifies as a girl, not as a boy that wants to look like a girl and uses she/her pronouns, trans girls are girls regardless of how they choose to present, femboys are boys regardless of how feminine they are, some even take hormones

the same thing applies to trans guys and butch girls, there’s a difference between a girl that has body dysphoria, takes testosterone, gets top surgery, prefers he/him pronouns, and maybe even a masculine name, and feels happy when people mistake him for a guy but still identifies as a girl nonetheless and a trans guy, trans guys are guys regardless of how they present

I'm hoping for some help on choosing a binder.

So, I would like a binder that I can wear to work.  However, I have a relatively physical job. I work at a pet supply store, so I'm throwing around 30lb bags of dog food all day. So, comfort and breathability are key issues for me.
The other consideration for me is that I have a bit of a short torso. When I wear a bra, I need to have the straps on the shortest setting, and sometimes even then they're falling off my shoulders. 

I've been looking at gc2b and shapeshifters. It looks like gc2b might be more comfortable but shapeshifters might fit me better?

Do you guys have any thoughts?

\&gt;  Not all nonbinary people identify as trans... Sometimes (and increasingly), nonbinary can be used to describe the aesthetic/presentation/expression of a cisgender or transgender person.

I was wondering how many people here agree with this, or feels it describes themselves. I used to assume that non-binary people were a part of the transgender umbrella, and the NB people I have known all have dysphoria and/or are overtly gender nonconforming. So what made the least sense to me was a person identifying as non-binary while being perfectly happy with their body and gender-conforming in expression. To me, that's a person who's happy with their gender. A cis person may disagree with gender roles or expectations, which is cool, but in most trans circles I've been in, that has nothing to do with your gender identification. (I think there are messed up social expectations for women, but that's not why I identify as a man.)

I have read people say plenty of times that there's no \*requirement\* to have body dysphoria or be androgynous in order to be nonbinary, and I also understand that some people have fluctuating dysphoria or presentation and all that. (I also call everyone ""they"" who requests it regardless of details like presentation.) But if you're totally happy with your body and present in line with your AGAB (feminine AFAB, masculine AMAB), would you be offended to be called cis, or gender conforming? If I said, ""They are a cis non-binary person,"" would that be insensitive? Do you think you have cis privilege?

Hello reddit! This was my girlfriend's idea because she is supportive but also clueless. I am a pansexual college kid, born female, and I thought my 'coming out' thing was said and done with that. But over the summer, I was having a lot of what I *think* is dysphoria. I started questioning my body, not like weight or anything like that, more like shape. I've got an average chest and very feminine hips. For a whole minute, I could've convinced myself I was trans FTM with how I felt about my body. Like the genuine thought of being a man made me so happy for just a split second, and then it didn't. I like my name, I like being a girl, I like most feminine things (though I know that doesn't define gender). I was a tomboy growing up for sure, but I also flipped into a more feminine side (only girl who danced, played basketball, and could kick anyone's ass).

Anyways, I'm here now asking for some kind of advice? I don't have many gender-queer friends to ask for help, and I know everyone is different. I've been using a non-binary identity and they/them pronouns for a while now, and while I think it helps, there are still days where I feel really off. I cut my hair and it's not that weird short androgynous length where I look like a 15 year old boy most of the time. I like it, but man do I miss my long hair. Sometimes I think I could use a different preferred name (my name is quite girly, but not horribly), but I can't pick one. I've tried binding, but I haven't had a good quality one yet so my experiences are eh (recommendations for those?) My closet is still mostly feminine clothes, but on days where I do switch it up, I usually feel pretty good while simultaneously being really nervous? I like my men's or women's deodorant/perfume/cologne also.

2020-03-31 20:49:30,fsl0b5,1,3,"Okay so for the past few years, I’ve been using sports bras to bind. I’m not out to my parents. When my mom asked me why I’ve been wearing more sports bras, I told her it was because my chest ruined some shirts and that they were comfortable. She believed that explanation and it was never brought up again.

Yesterday, I received my very first real binder! Yay! I’ve been obsessed with it and wore it both yesterday and today.
