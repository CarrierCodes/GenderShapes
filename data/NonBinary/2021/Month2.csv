I have identified as non-binary for a few years now, but in the past year have started to question how I identify. I don't feel like I fall into a binary gender, but I'm becoming increasingly unsatisfied with the term non-binary.

I'm very grateful for the term as it provides so many people with ways to identify outside of binary genders and where I live it is also helpful for helping people understand what it means to be gender non-conforming. However, I think my issue is how broad it is - I understand that it can mean different things for different people, but I feel like saying I am non-binary is less about saying what I am but more signaling that I'm just not a man or a woman. My gender feels pretty constant, so I don't identify with genderqueer and other types of terms that imply fluidity either.

Does anyone else feel this way? I even feel the same way about a term like Third Gender, as I wish there were some specific way I could express myself that isn't as vague.

I thought about posting this because I spoke with a friend on the phone today about my feelings on this and was surprised to find out that they agree.

Additionally, if you know of any resources that might be helpful for learning about this dilemma, I am definitely open to it. I'm aware of specific third gender terms around the world, but don't feel it's appropriate to identify with many them because I'm don't have origins in some cultures that use them.

Info: I’m AMAB, 25 years old, engaged to a woman who I love whole heartedly.

Hello! New to Reddit, but just had a question. So for the past 3 years, I haven't exactly felt comfortable with he/him pronouns. I am not uncomfortable with he/him, but lately, they have been making me wince a little bit whenever I hear it in reference to me. I still think I identify as a guy, but I have also just been testing out they/them pronouns (entirely when I think of myself in my head). I have had a close friend use they/them pronouns with me and it felt right. I know this isn't a telltale sign of anything, but I also wouldn't mind exploring other fashion/accessories that wouldn't typically be masculine. 

I recently went grocery shopping today, with the intent to pretend I only use they/them pronouns (it never actually came up while I was at the store). But I did feel a little bit more...I don't know I guess confident (that isn't the right word, but it is the only one I can think of. Almost like a little weight was lifted off my shoulders).

soooooooooooooooooo, I am not sure where that leaves me. Are these typical signs of maybe being more gender fluid than I originally thought or felt when I was a kid (I mean even as a kid I could have not felt that entirely comfortable, I just do not remember)? Could it just be stress or other things in my life?

when my mum brought the package in, i was really happy since she doesn’t really know what it is inside (as far as she knows, it’s just a t-shirt). but as she was walking away, she said “haha, it says the name Raven on it. why’d you put that?! hahahaha”

\- I use they/them &amp; present super fem. I am AFAB, but I have no preference for pen pals

\- I'm currently in New England (North Eastern US) and would love to meet someone outside of New England or even outside of the states! 

\- I am in a committed monogamous relationship - any interactions would be **strictly platonic**  

\- Ideally someone 18-24ish who is still in their undergraduate, or very early masters

2021-02-01 21:41:45,laf0lz,0,1,"I was raised by a lesbian couple who got pregnant by sperm donation. At birth, I was technically assigned female, but given a completely gender neutral name. Growing up my parents put little to no weight on my gender besides using she/her pronouns when referring to me. Even if other people said thing like “oh what a cute little boy” they didn’t correct them.

I was dressed in gender neutral clothing until I was old enough to pick my own clothes. I was very tall and broad shouldered so I often picked a mix of boy an girl clothes because my parents and I were solely focused on finding things that fit me correctly. 

My parents never made me wear my hair long and in fact encouraged me to cut it short a few times so it would be easier to care for. I was also allowed to pick any toys I wanted besides toy guns and violent video games. 

Because of the way my parents treated me and the way I dressed I was treated as non-binary by my community as well. I don’t think it was intentional, but just a response to my appearance, name, and personality. For example I was really into theatre as a kid and was cast repeatedly as semi-gender neutral characters such as the Genie from Aladdin, the Mad Hatter, Peter Pan, Flotsam from the Little Mermaid and a variety of “professional” characters like Chef, Judge, Police Office etc. 

It wasn’t until I was in my mid-late teens and I started growing breasts that people treated me like a girl. Now I feel a little weird identifying as Non-binary because I only have dysphoria when I’m in extremely gender based situations. For example I have no issue checking “female” on forms or being referred to by she/her, but I felt really uncomfortable when my boss put me in charge of a “Women’s Wellbeing Seminar” because it just feels incorrect. I also don’t have an issue with my breasts as a part of my body, but I do have an issue with how people treat me because I have breasts and how I usually have to buy Women’s business clothes because Men’s clothes don’t fit me. 

I also feel like the less people care about my gender the less of an issue I have with them using words like “girl, daughter, sister, girlfriend” to refer to me.

For example I have no issue checking “female” on forms or being referred to by she/her, but I felt really uncomfortable when my boss put me in charge of a “Women’s Wellbeing Seminar” because it just feels incorrect. I also don’t have an issue with my breasts as a part of my body, but I do have an issue with how people treat me because I have breasts and how I usually have to buy Women’s business clothes because Men’s clothes don’t fit me. \n\nI also feel like the less people care about my gender the less of an issue I have with them using words like “girl, daughter, sister, girlfriend” to refer to me. \n\nDid anyone else have an experience like this growing up?

Hey guys. I thought this might be a sub that gets this struggle I've been having lately. 

The other day, triggered by an upcoming doc appointment, I had a full on crying jag about how much I hate my body, particularly my breasts, don't want anyone seeing them, wish I was just a shapeless void, etc etc etc. This led me to start thinking about top surgery. It's not the first time, at all, but it's definitely one of the first times I've realized how bad it's getting.

Cons: 

* I'm fat and afraid I'll run into BMI restrictions 
* I'm ADHD and afraid I'll do something wrong with aftercare (less likely, I've got a partner and a metamour to help),

Example of gender euphoria for me are:

* **Shaving my head every month!** I actually kinda like my face now and there's something very freeing about not having hair. Also the only hair I shave on my body is my head, so it feels kinda like a fuck you to society.
* **Wearing big, billowy, tunic-like dresses.** In my head their androgynous/genderless lol, or at least I feel that way when I wear them. Also known as toddler-fashion.
* **Being in nature**: going on a walk and feeling the sun and wind is another way for me to enjoy my body when it is often hard to. It's a sensory experience that grounds me and reminds me of all the nice things my body does for me and allows me to experience even if i'm sometimes at war with it or detached from it.
* **Listening to music and dancing!** The right song will make me super unselfconscious of my body and I can just exist and be free! Goofy, odd dancing is genderless, I tell ya. Also bonus points if I can pretend like i'm in a music video if I go on a walk while listening to music.
* **Playing in makeup**: maybe unconventional as an AFAB, but playing around and doing strange or otherworldly makeup looks is a lot of fun. A lot of gender euphoria for me is allowing myself to act and be like a kid again, because I feel like when I was super young I could just exist and not worry to much about performing this or that gender. 
* **As a fat enby, finding masc clothes that actually fit my body well and give it the silhouette I want**: there's always the duality of having to find clothes that fit and are tailored well to my body as a fat person, and also not exclusively feminine (since there's often pressure for fat AFAB's to be hyperfeminine and so clothes are oriented that way).

So I have some pretty horribly large chest lumps (36H) and have so far not bought a binder as assumed it would be painful and not very effective. I'm feeling pretty dysphoric over said chest lumps though and am wondering whether a binder would help.
A few questions I'd really appreciate input on:
Will a binder be effective to reduce said chest lumps, will they just become smaller when wearing or is there a way they could actually get smaller if I wear one regularly?
Will it be really painful to wear a binder due to horrifying size of chest lumps? - it hurts to lie on my front and squish them etc.

Hey friends! I wanted to check in and let you all know about my progress on low dose T. I posted a link to my 1 week update in case anyone wants to start there. So far not a lot of changes since my first post. 

Mental: I talked about how great it feels to have a better mind/body connection and I still feel that way but something strange happened at the beginning of week 2; my anxiety skyrocketed for a few days. I think it was a combo of extra energy on T/new feelings of being present in real time. I feel like even though I didn’t enjoy how things were pre-T I still had a safety net and knew what to expect. I’ve always been one to think 12 steps ahead just so I can prepare myself for every outcome, almost to the point of being able to predict things that will happen. When I started T I didn’t feel the need to be “on” all the time and that realization came with me having to find a new baseline. I didn’t feel the need to obsess over what was going to happen and my anxiety made me believe that the fact I didn’t feel the need to obsess was wrong somehow(the human mind is so bizarre) but I guess we are creatures of habit; even if those habits harm us. After I processed what was happening and also cut down on my caffeine intake I was able to become clear headed again. I still have moments of panic and feeling like things are surreal but this is a journey and there will be many bumps along the road. I’m willing to deal with those bumps because I finally feel like I’m headed in the right direction. 

Physical: Things are still uber slow on this front and I’m okay with that. I think if physical changes happened too fast my anxiety would ramp up more. My body hair is getting slightly longer on my arms but still light in color. I have more hair on my upper thighs but very patchy. I can tell I’m getting more muscle definition and I feel stronger. Last Friday I had horrible leg pain that felt similar to growing pains when I was a kid. I read that ligaments and tendons change when T is introduced so I’m thinking that was the reason. I was able to control it with Advil. Skin changes are the same, just a bit more oily and a few pimples. Bottom growth continues to happen but not terribly noticeable. My smell seems to be changing. I have less overall body softness/fat.

Hi, I'm a Musician/Motion graphic designer living in South Korea. also I'm androgyne.

In Korea, There's some queer community, too. but I have several bad experience about gender discrimination and sexual minority discrimination from there, so I decided to write this post on reddit.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday, I heard Spotify is launched in South Korea. I'm really excited because there's so many great artists and exclusive tracks on Spotify. So I installed app immediately and tapped on Sign up button.  After entering the email address and the password, and I saw this screen-

There's no option for me. Something is weird. So I turned on my desktop and entered the Spotify website.

&amp;#x200B;

There's Non-binary option in US Sign up page, but deleted in Korea Sign up page.

I really upset about this, so I commented about this on Spotify korea instagram page, but they're not answering anything and there are only malicious and mocking comments from korean users.

Honestly, there's almost no ""Non-binary"" or ""Custom"", ""Rather not to say"" options in Korean websites.  But they don't have to delete the existing options.

I googled with ""non-binary"", ""spotify"" keyword and I found one post on spotify community asking about deleted non-binary option on Spotify Korea. I think I need to write the post on there.

I'm AMAB. I have always preferred being around women, nbs, and trans (hell I'll even feel more comfortable being myself around my weird Asian Karen aunts than intimidating mansplaining older men). But ever since I entered the workforce and more general academic spaces (so like, not a specific artsy major full of like-minded mostly female/lgbt people) I've been socially forced into all-cishet male groups...and I've never felt such a huge disconnect.

2021-02-03 07:49:38,lbilqd,6,5,"Hello.

So, uh, as the title says, I’m feeling... a little lost, to put it delicately?

I’m AMAB, haven’t ever questioned my gender identity, which is (was?) man, until a few weeks ago a mutual friend (that sadly moved away) came out as non-binary and asked us, their cis(question mark here bc I’m now unsure if this term applies to me) friends, to consider our own gender identity.

Why exactly did we feel like we were men?

...this led me into a massive quest of introspection into my own gender identity. I like being referred to as “he/him.” I feel like it suits me. But then I started to consider that I might also be comfortable being referred to as, “they/them.”

I thought even further about my role when it came to my different relationships. 

I’m a brother to two sisters biologically, and a brother to many more emotionally speaking. I like being referred to as the “son” of my parents (who are a little clueless when it comes to LGBQTIA+ matters, but bc I’m gay they’re trying their hardest and it’s wholesome as shit, you guys).

But the titles of “man” and “boy” always made me feel a bit... off, I suppose. Especially after my friend asked me that particular question. 

It made me feel like a labels such as “ man”  and “boy” (or even “woman”) didn’t really convey who I really am.

And I’d think it’d be okay to still be non-binary even if I’m leaning more towards masculinity, utilize he/him pronouns, and love being referred to as people’s “brother,” but then my anxiety (which is never fun) trips me up and makes me doubt myself and put myself down.

Honestly, it’s making me feel guilty even writing this or posting this at all.

Many posts on here have been really helpful, inspiring, courageous, emotional, and beautiful. The general consensus is one of inclusivity, respect, empathy, consideration, and care.

Can any of y’all tell me if I’m being a massive, ignorant y clown and should stick to my cisgendered identity of “man,” or is it really, truthfully okay for me to refer to myself as non-binary despite what my anxiety may be telling me? Even if it feels as though there’s a certain amount of privilege in my particular situation given that I’m AMAB and enjoy “he/him” pronouns?

If the phrasing of any statement or question I made here is ignorant, misguided, or offensive, I am truly, truly sorry. I’m just looking for some help, I suppose, I’m navigating my place in something I had never previously considered before.

We were just discussing gender norms and roles last night and he brought up that he believes he was born trans. That led me to thinking about people who identify as non-binary. Do you believe that as a non binary person, you are acknowledging gender roles (defined here as expectations assigned by biological processes) and choosing to reject them/have grown to emotionally and intellectually reject them? I speculated that someone would have to arrive to the point of being non-binary by acknowledging the existence of gender roles and not subscribing to them. Also, what was the pivotal moment where you realized that you are rejecting these expectations? Does anyone feel that it is possible to be born non-binary, or is it a conscious choice? Also, because everything we know has been placed categorically to fit somewhere on the spectrum between male and female, what does expressing non-binary look/feel like to you? In a sense, because everything has been rigidly defined, wouldn’t you say that you still fall somewhere on the spectrum at any given day because you’re adapting a certain style, behavior, way of presenting (I.e one day you’re presenting feminine versus the next day, you are presenting more masculine) ? Since societally we haven’t defined any other gender but male or female, is it safe to say that all the “otherness” is simply someone who can move between the two points on the spectrum? Can a non-binary person truly fit the description of non-binary if all that exists rigidly are two defined genders? (What I refer to here is the person who got reassignment surgery to just have a pee-hole, with no resemblance of a reproductive organ and dresses quite alien-like, looking neither feminine nor masculine because of the level of outrageousness they have achieved in appearance. To me, this seems like the truest form of being non-binary, if you were sticking to definitions to the T.) 

No hate here, only acceptance and the desire to fully understand to the best of my ability.

Initially when I told my parents their response was generally accepting “whatever, you’re our weird kid, we love you for it, end of story”. Once they found out that I told more people than just them, their response changed drastically. They were no longer supportive, started yelling at me to remove my Facebook post (which received a lot of positivity), and compared my identity to pedophilia, saying that I shouldn’t be working with children. Once this happened I completely shut down and felt really uncomfortable being myself around them or anyone at all. I love being nonbinary but still have a lot of shame, self-doubt, and fear of being treated this way ever again.

I do present more femme most of the time, so perhaps my parents just assume I changed my mind or got out of this “phase”, but my mom especially ALWAYS refers to me in traditionally feminine terms (she/her, girl, princess, etc.). It feels like she believes that if she says it enough she can convince me that I am my gender assigned at birth. I’ve tolerated it for so long and I tend to respond passively or just shut down. But I hate that I do this and that I allow it to go unmentioned.

Current problem: My mom just sent me a text referring to me as a “girl”. It seems like the perfect time to address it in a way that won’t feel as threatening as talking in person. On one hand I am so afraid that I will be met with hurtful comments or that she will dismiss me which might be worse than saying nothing at all.

2021-02-03 23:25:56,lc1gu6,7,6,"Hello, I'm new haha 😅 Kind of serious rant incoming.

I've always struggled with identifying completely with a certain thing.
 I've identified as a lesbian for about 3.5 years now, and until recently, I've been fine with that. But these days, I'm kind of unsure if that's ""all"".
 Some days I like to say ""I'm a human before I'm a woman"" but some days, I don't really... connect with the word ""woman"".

 When I was younger (around 5 years ago), I used to identify as bigender and picked a new name too, but as nobody really respected it or tried to adapt, I let it be and went back to being ""just a girl"".
 Almost weekly, my sexuality and identity are doubted by my family and my friends.
 I already have problems with my sexual identity because people don't believe me. What would happen if I identified as non-binary too?

 I don't think people would get it or respect it at all. They would tell me it's all nonsense, just like they did back then.

 I live in a country where there are no gender neutral pronouns and I feel like if I used neopronouns, they wouldn't be respected or used either.
 I've put my pronouns as she/they on all social media platforms for about two months now, but people only ever seem to use she anyways. (These people seem to only accept the androgynous and or alt nb people as enbies, and if you ask me, that's kinda weird.)

 I think the label that fits me best would be demigirl, and I guess it's a good thing that I at least have a term for it and not just a stuttered explanation. 
But yeah. Being referred to with neutral pronouns or neopronouns gives me a really warm feeling in my chest. (So do female pronouns but if that was all I wouldn't be here) 

So, after all this ranting, here are a few questions I hope you can help with:

1. Is it worth it? The hassle, the frustration. Will I make myself more unhappy if I put this burden on myself? Or does the freedom override the bad feelings?

2. Should I come out to my friends now? Or should I do it later when it's more guaranteed that they'll respect my ""new"" identity? (Telling my family is absolutely out of question. Maybe when I've moved out. MAYBE.)

3. Am I trans if I identify as non-binary? If part of my identity is my agab, is it still trans?

4. Am I still a lesbian if I'm technically not (""just"") a woman (anymore)? What would the new ""label"" be if not?

5. What do I do if non-binary suddenly doesn't fit me anymore, and I ""go back"" to being a woman? Do I tell people? Or is that just pertaining (is that the right word?) to their stereotypes again?

If you read until here, thank you from the bottom of my heart. If you can answer a question or even just comment about the other things I've said, that would be so cool.

For my whole life, I have identified as female, only really learning about non binary people more in the last couple years. 
Recently, I have been having thoughts about my childhood and currently feelings about my current identification. For one, I remember always wanting to have a gender nuetral name, and I definitely identified as a tomboy. I really dislike my ultra feminine name. I also idolized another girl that I knew who was more masculine and I wanted to be like them. 
As I got older, I think I did have a shift to liking more feminine things, but I still didn't embrace traditional femininity. For one, I shaved my head and felt extremely happy. That was until I was relentlessly bullied for it. My mom said that it made me look like a boy, but that comment didn't bother me. She also gets upset when I refer to myself as a boy in a lighthearted manner (I can't remember an example of how right now). I sometimes also, as an adult, like having gender neutral clothing choices, but sometimes more fem.
I there are also some things about being afab that makes me extremely uncomfortable, namely pregnancy. The thought of getting pregnant, seeing the changes to my body makes me feel very scared and uncomfortable -- like that I could never see that for me at all.

I'm 21, afab, comfortably in a relationship of 2 years that never should have worked, out as pan to my immediate family and friends, and only like 6 people know about my gender, even less of that number accepts it.

I'm not really one for labels. Honestly I don't enjoy nonbinary or pansexual, they just happen to be words that people can semi relate to. What I really mean is ""I don't care"". Not about pronouns, not about the gender of people I think are beautiful, none of it. You wanna call me some obscure thing you found on one lonely corner of a forum? Go for it. You don't feel comfortable addressing me as anything other than what I pass to be? Okay. I know what I look like.

Then there's the fact that I have yet to run into a enby who experiences dysphoria the way I do. And maybe it's because one of those people decided 5 months later they were fully trans, and maybe its because I've only ever gotten to talk to maybe 4 enby people total in more than just a passing and probably slightly creepy ""i think you're beautiful, have a nice day"" kind of way. I'm not seeing anything in the rules about not being able to talk about genital stuff, but that's where this is going if you'd like to stop now.

Basically, I've never talked to an enby about their experience and found it to be anything like mine. I seem to sort of fall as a direct center of the scale, rather than lean any which way? I've never felt particularly masculine or feminine, but at the same time I feel like I ak both, and the parts of my body that don't give me dysphoria are the parts that are most androgynous. Like my calves? And my hands?

Unfortunately, wearing a US 34G as a bra size, binding isn't a thing. So I've spent years making peace with my chest. The other half... not so much. Any maybe if I didn't feel like a pervert and a nymphomaniac every time I've tried to describe what my issues are below the waist it might be easier.

Basically, it's always felt wrong that I didn't have both sets of genitalia. My breasts I'm fine with, I've learned to love. I can get behind my vagina sometimes, but boy is the lack of something else just an open sore. I can't wear tight jeans. Loose shorts don't feel right. I've tried packing before, and it helps, but I feel like everyone on Earth is judging me no matter how well I try and hide it.

And I've never met someone aside from my best friend and my partner who is okay with me packing, whether in public or just for myself at home. Not even my ex friends, who claimed their love and support no matter what, then told me ""thats not a gender, that's being fucked up"". Not even my fully trans male friend.

Hi everyone, I'm a 16-year-old almost-certainly-nonbinary. I've felt severe discomfort with my large chest for quite some time, but lately, I've explored binding and it's made a *world* of difference. The (emotional) discomfort was completely gone, but there was one large problem - the physical discomfort. 

Due to my chest size, I have to bind (with a sports bra, no less!) quite tightly to get anything *remotely* close to a flat chest. I quickly came to the realisation that unless I have surgery, the appearance I want is devastatingly unattainable.

Now comes the crux of my problem:

1. I'm not out to my parents as *trans*, although I am out to my mum as a lesbian (she's supportive).
2. When I brought up the idea of removing my breasts, my mum was shocked and said she would pay for a *reduction*, not removal. After some discussion, she said she would think about it. (Knowing how stubborn I can be, these damn lumps are coming *off*! I'll take her consideration as a win).
3. A requirement for top surgery where I live is to have well-documented gender dysphoria. In order to document this, I would have to come out to my mum as trans, which isn't happening (she's old school &amp; wouldn't understand)

**Could I get a mastectomy instead of top surgery?** Would results be similar? I *really* don't care about a ""masculine"" chest, I just want it to be flat. Shape be damned!

(Which only two are transgender and even then I came out way before them.) When I was in grade six I started feeling this way, and actually thought I only wanted to be a boy. Same for the year seven. However, after covid19 started, over that long period, I realized I was not always a boy, girl, or enby.

I tried to explain this to her (months after I realized my true feelings.) and her response was, ""Yeah, and you know what? That label is also most common in people who are confused."" ""It is also most common in females who fear the travel into womanhood."" I'm convinced she's getting all her, ""research"" from Wikipedia sites. She also rejects my pronouns, I even told her I'm fine with her using my birth name, I just told her I need my pronouns. But she won't even do that. She used multiple excuses not to use my real pronouns even one being, ""I have a three year old downstairs, she's going to be confused.""  She said that I don't think about how my decisions will effect other people, and called me selfish.

She said that I'm just trying to get involved in everything, and even made remarks about how she thinks polyamorus people are disgusting. Her excuse for this was that it was created by Mormons originally as an excuse for men to marry multiple woman? I don't understand where her information is coming from. She also tried to tell me they're rejected from the community, and they're not. She also stated that she, the cisgender heterosexual, knows more than I, the non-binary pansexual. She thinks that I have some sort of oh so godly prejudice over cishets. Which first of all, cishet is the societal norm, they're not oppressed for being cishet so even if I did for some reason, it shouldn't be a big deal if being homophobic/transphobic isn't.

When she outed me as transgender at the age of twelve I told her I wasn't ready to talk about it, however she forced me. I wasn't ready and didn't understand how I felt yet, and now she's using that as an excuse to say I'm confused now. Because, ""I thought I was transgender first now this."" She's blaming my feelings towards myself on hating my body, peer influence, social media, and a whole bunch of other stuff. I discovered the term for my feeling on the internet sure, but that doesn't mean that I'm just trying to copy people. People like me are killed in other con and she has the audacity to tell me it's for the fad? She told me when I was eleven that we'd wait til I was fourteen to start using pronouns and talk about a new name. I'm now fourteen and she's now saying she wont even use my pronouns until I'm eighteen. She says that she's not transphobic but I'm 100% sure purposefully misgendering is the most common transphobic action. 

She's the type of person who wont sit down to have conversations, and never listens to what I say to her. She even has multiple parental controls on each one of my electronic devices, and up until last year had a baby monitor in my room. She has now blocked the app tiktok from my phone so I can't use it until she goes through all my messages and my videos. When she gets mad at me she takes my door. Not even when I do something, just when she's mad at me. She can hear all of my calls and see all of my text messages from her phone. I can't even have many friends over because I can't stay up past 10:30 on the weekends. It used to be 9:30 until this year.

I haven't known her before the age of ten because I was adopted by her stepmother because she couldn't take care of me when I was born. (Because of finances) I am fourteen years of age and I need to have privacy and respect for my new pronouns.

Let’s see. So I work in education as an occupational therapy practitioner, and I’m non-binary. I started coming out earlier this year and it went great. Teachers have been super respectful and inclusive. Everyone started with the switch from Ms. to Mx. I was thrilled to finally feel myself. A principal asked me when I first announced my arrival what my expectations were and told me not to put a demand on the students. I completely understood as a lot of students I support haven’t grasped he-she. So fine whatever. I was hoping that as time went on they would hear my pronouns and either ask or just continue to be exposed without the direct addressing. Now I’m wondering how to I go about teachers using my pronouns. I’ve kind of let it slide because correcting people in front of other people and in front of children seems inappropriate to me.

I don't see a lot of text posts on here, so tell me if me posting this is out of line &amp; I'll remove it.

So, I'm 36, which makes me pretty late to the party. I was just wondering: could anyone tell me what dysphoria is, like, like? What does it feel like? How do you recognize it?

I've been sort of... sad? for about 20 years now. I've never been able to figure out why. But recently, I've been growing my hair out, and I also got this cute sweater which is ridiculously big for me. It's bright and silly and femme and I love it. It makes me feel better. And I've been experimenting with nail polish, off and on, for a while. It helps. In general, I feel better whenever I look less masc.

On the other hand, when I'm wearing an (uber-masc) company dress shirt for work, I feel like I could die. If we have to go back to the office at some point &amp; I have to be wearing that crap, keeping my hair short, looking like a... man... Ugh, I just dread it. Dread, dread, dread.

In general, I don't feel like I ""get"" gender at all. People have been telling me I'm a guy all my life, obviously, but I'm not sure I ever felt like they were quite right about that. I talked to a psychiatrist when I was 17 or so, but they essentially told me ""nah you're cis (though they didn't know to use that word at the time) because you don't want breasts &amp; the Big Operation Down There."" Which is true, I don't want that. So I went back into the cis box after that. But it was a different time &amp; I'm pretty sure the psychiatrists hadn't even heard of NB at the time.

(Side note, my real-life initials are NB, which I think is hilarious.)

So, long run up to this question:

How did you know, or how did you decide for yourself, that what you were feeling was gender dysphoria? Especially if it took you a while longer to figure out, like me – how do I even recognize dysphoria? I'm just so unsure about all of this. It doesn't help, I'm sure, that I grew up in a rural area way back when everything gender-related was generally invisible and misunderstood.

Im really not feeling okay right now and i hope you'll hear me out.

I commented on a Facebook post on a trans page and the post was ""cis gender people use 'learning pronouns' as an excuse to not change what they fundamentally think of a persons gender""

So my initial comment was ""Me and my partner are both NonBinary and misgender each other by accident all the time.
Lets only get mad at intentional misgendering and people that dont care to try please.""

This post might be long, too, so you truly have my thanks if you read it all.  


I'm 26, AMAB, and very recently (a few weeks ago) I had a massive revelation that I'm bisexual. It just kind of randomly hit me when I was kind of crushing on a dude in a show I was watching, and as soon as the thought occurred to me, it made perfect sense and instantly contextualized aspects of myself and feelings I'd had in the past that I didn't know how to explain otherwise. Coming to that realization has been great- I haven't told anyone about it, but it feels amazing to have that self affirmation about my sexuality that I had been so unclear about before.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, about 3 days ago, I started to have other questions come up about my identity. Someone referred to me as ""manly"" and, inwardly, I kind of wretched at that label. I don't feel ""manly"" at all, and the thought of being so is offputting. Now, the thing is, I appear very masculine- I am fairly handsome, bearded, and I'm into bodybuilding/ powerlifting so I'm pretty built. I truly love expressing myself physically this way- I don't desire to change my outward appearance at all- and yet, attributing these physical traits to ""manliness"" just feels wrong. The thing is, outside of my weightlifting/ fitness hobbies, my interests skew much more towards traditionally feminine things. I LOVE baking/ cake decorating, cooking, homemaking, cute crafts, scented candles, fruity cocktails, stuffed animals, cute pokemon, romance movies/ tv, ANYTHING pink colored or with hearts on it... I could go on, but you get the idea. 

I've loved these things for a long time, and never really knew why. I wondered for a while if I was trans and it was the female inside of me wanting to come out, but that never really rang true internally. Now, I'm thinking NB might make sense for me? Nothing about me is really androgynous or in-between- I have aspects of me that are extremely masculine, and ones that are extremely feminine. Somehow, the idea of being nonbinary seems like it might make sense as a way to bring those two things together into one identity, but I really don't know enough about this sort of thing to come to that conclusion, hence my post here.

What is the difference between hatred towards your body caused by sexual trauma and gender dysphoria? How do you know if they overlap?

——————————optional reading————————

I am 13 and I’ve been identifying as non-binary for about three months now. But now, I’m really not sure if I am. Because I found out about a buried memory of sexual abuse. The first one is when I was 10 when my own (biological) father touched my breast when I was naked (it happened 3 to 4 times). Another one is when I was between 10 or 11 when my trumpet teacher touched my back under my clothes and touched my thighs also. I never told anyone about the first experience, but I have told my best friend (who told my parents) about the second event months after it started. I really thought it was normal, so I never thought of it again and it was buried in my memory. 

My experience with “gender dysphoria” was my hatred towards my breast and my butt. Which kind of makes sense given the sexual abuse that I experienced. I never felt discomfort in pronouns but I just thought that it was because English is my second language and because I have Alexithymia and autism. I don’t want a curvy body (also known as “hourglass body”) that most women have in some extent. I wanted to chop off my breast and flatten my butt. I already told my parents about it to let me take puberty blockers (which they did not allow). 

But just because I have been sexually abused doesn’t mean that the possibility of both gender dysphoria and sexual abuse don’t exist. I analyzed myself a bit, and here’s what I think. 

Just one note that I have difficulty identifying my emotions because of Alexithymia and the emotion may be inaccurate. Also having alexithymia doesn’t mean that I don’t have emotions, it just means that I have hard time figuring out what I’m feeling. 

1. When you have gender dysphoria, you hate that you are in your own body. In my case, I hate every woman’s body. 

2. I only experience the “physical gender dysphoria” (I’m only putting quotations because I’m not sure whether this is gender Dysphoria or not. I’m not implying that gender dysphoria isn’t real.)

3. I don’t like women’s clothings because it tend to show my female body characteristics, not because they are for women. (Personally I prefer androgynous clothes because it looks nice though)

I may be wrong about my emotions, and my analysis could be totally wrong. Please let me know what you think about this. 

Another disclaimer: Please don’t pity me or anything. I haven’t thought about the traumas enough to know what I feel about it. Also, don’t tell me to go see a therapist or talk to my parents. 1) I don’t have authority and money to see a therapist and I dislike the school counselor. 2) other people on Reddit have mentioned that both my parents may be emotionally/verbally abusive but I dislike both of them regardless of whether they are abusive or not.

2021-02-09 17:50:27,lg8xyz,0,1,"I think this post is going to be just thoughs on a screen, I'm not totally sure what I'm looking for...

I'm AFAB and femme, I identify as a nonbinary woman because socially I'm perceived as a woman. I'm as close to being a cis woman as is possible to be, but I'm absolutely not a cis woman.

Being femme for me is very much performative, it feels like I've got to be femme to be accepted also as 'feminine' is...easier. Sure being feminine is more work, with the shaving and the heels and the makeup and the harassment from cis dudes, but at the same time it's easier for me to know what's expected from how I look when it comes to being feminine.

I used to live as a dude when I was younger, I'd have greasy hair and no makeup and just throw on comfy boots with baggy jeans and sweater. Being a dude was a lot easier but it also required less effort and that made me feel like I wasn't taking pride in my appearance. That thinking stays with me, then add body dysmorphic disorder/OCD around my looks, I feel I've got to be hyper feminine in order to be seen as taking care of my grooming and appearance. 

A gender neutral or androgynous look is even harder for me to wrap my head around.

I'd sort of like to explore presenting in a more mascule way. When I think about masculinity it's often a tad toxic, my mind goes to some sort of pimp where masculinity comes from misogyny and control of women or Peaky Blinders-esque male violence...or if I were a cis man I think I'd be a flamboyant femme gay man.

I just do not understand what “identifying with a gender” REALLY means. I see a lot of non binary people describe a dislike for societal gender roles, norms, and stereotypes and I completely agree. I feel like gender should be more of an Adjective than a defining trait. I think of myself as a person who just happens to be born female.  There is nothing more to it, just a descriptor, like the fact that I was born with brown eyes or blonde hair. I don’t understand why somebody would feel uncomfortable with identifying with something that just describes your outward appearance, especially when we are pushing for the breaking of gender norms.

I hear a lot about how gender is mental while sex is physical, and how gender is a human construct that isn’t biological. Is gender just referring to gender NORMS? For example, I do not live by stereotypical female gender norms. I wear masculine clothes, I am proud of being assertive rather than “ladylike” among other not-so-feminine things. I don’t see why not identifying with the gender roles of your sex would inherently make you not a member of that sex. If we are trying to break down gender roles, showing that women can do the same shit a man can because there is no real difference, why is it that when you don’t identify with these gender roles you then reject your assigned sex as a whole? Women can be masculine. Men can be feminine. I don’t understand why me being masculine would make me not a woman, if sex is only skin deep anyway.

I don’t want to just wait around for her to decide to finally understand what being non-binary is and if she’ll even find me attractive with no chest. I’m at a loss...I love her very very much.

She wears baggy hoodie and exclusively pants, short hair cut and generally presents as a type of ""tomboy"". All of her friends are girls and two of them have already ""come out"" as trans. She not into dresses or makeup or most ""feminine"" things and she definitely doesn't like sports or any ""masculine"" things. Her only real interests are horseback riding, anime, and horror movies.

As she is 12 and just starting puberty I have talked to a fair amount of CIS (another new acronym) women about their time at that age and they've voice a lot of the same issues that she mentioned during our talk.

So my question is: Does this sound like someone who has a handle on what she feels she is, or is it a case of a little girl feeling like she maybe doesn't belong to what the world tells her a girl is and is searching for something else?

Obviously I love and support her and want the best for her no matter what that is, but I can't help but feel like she's 12 and has no idea what road she's going down.

2021-02-10 23:14:03,lh6rzi,4,1,"I feel as if gender is just something created by culture. For example there are places where men wear skirts and make up, there are places where swearing is a feminine trait and politeness is a manly trait since it is used in politics. Pink was originally for boys etc. I think that our gender doesn't change what we are capable of (but sex does). 

{ by saying this I don't want to hurt any trans people. If they say that they are uncomfortable with their gender who am I to question that. I am just confused myself. Everyone can do whatever they want. }

I feel like gender is pretty meaningless for me. Any feminen trait I have could have been considered manly in another culture and vice versa. I don't feel any gender but doesn't most people? Does that make me non-binary? I feel as if gender traits are just prejudiced generalisation. 

I don't understand. When I made a post in trans subreddit asking about the culture thing someone said something like ""when you are born into the gender that you are asigned to, you don't feel that something is wrong. But if it's the other way around you feel trapped"".  Which made sense. I didn't feel any gender since I was already the gender of my sex. But then I saw this definition and I'm confused.

Like while buying stuff which are assigned to a gender I feel kinda annoyed since ""clothes are just clothes why does it have a gender?!"". I don't know what it means to feel a gender. 

Also we don't have gendered pronouns in my mother tongue so she/he/they thing doesn't make sense for me. Everyone is ""they"" in my language and maybe that's why I think this way. I am not reminded of gender while talking. I just feel as if everything gender related is unnecessary and can be applied to all genders.

Is this just the way that I think or does it fit the non-binary definition? I just don't understand how someone can feel a gender while gender definitions can change. Or maybe I don't understand what gender is. Can someone explain? I think that most people don't feel a gender. Most are just born into a sex and they go along with it.

Somehow I ended up with a lot of internet friends who are nonbinary, including one who recently came out and changed their name and pronouns and one who casually mentioned being a demigirl. 

It pretty much forced me to start learning more about gender stuff, especially as the topic used to make me deeply uncomfortable (whether it was scrolling through convos about experiences, or lobbing around headcanons and character ideas involving more esoteric concepts of gender), now it's kind of fascinating and in brief...I sort of *want* to be something other than cis.

At the same time, I know I can't. I was always very feminine growing up and still am, never had a hint of gender issues. Just occasional flashes of feeling distinctly neutral or even masculine, occasional and fairly recent discomfort with some labels, and curiosity about androgynous presentation. I feel though that I shouldn't touch it though, since it would basically be appropriating something for an aesthetic or to feel special. 

I still don't even understand what being nonbinary even *is* at its core: what actually makes one not a man or woman?

2021-02-11 02:11:16,lhad83,10,2,"Deciding to be brave today by reaching out in hopes of learning more. Please forgive me if I use the wrong terms, and let me know if there’s a more appropriate place to post this. Cross-posting to r/enby.

I’m trying to figure out whether I truly might identify as non-binary, or whether I might be improperly using that identity as a convenient excuse for failing womanhood. 

Background: AFAB, 41, raised Christian, homeschooled, rather neglected and alone in childhood, married to a man for almost 20 years, no kids, no body dysphoria, like 95% sure I’m only attracted to men. Generally bookish, badass, introvert, dog-lover.

I get misgendered almost every day when I’m working. I work in a traditionally male-dominated field, and I’m big and tall, bland features, no makeup, pixie cut. I’m almost always wearing men’s work clothes, because my employer provides bulky men’s shirts/hoodies, and I usually buy men’s pants/boots/accessories simply because they’re seemingly the only ones available in the entire universe that actually fit me, have POCKETS, and can stand up to the tough working conditions. (The #geargap is real, folks.) I sew a bit, so I can alter men’s clothes to my body as needed.

With my boots/helmet, I’m over 6’ tall, and almost always muddy. I love my job. On my good days, I feel like a warrior queen, strong and mighty, and I used to be glad to represent fierce women. If I stopped at the grocery store after work (still in my work clothes), people who aren’t really looking call me “Sir”. I used to relish looking them in the eye and correcting them “Ma’am” and watching them die a little inside. But then it got old. And then it got weird. Especially once we all started wearing masks. 

I don’t know how many times I’ve caused a panic by walking into a public women’s restroom. I hear people warning others, and complaining to managers (“There’s A MAN in there!!”) and generally clutching their pearls. I work outside, and lately I have given up on peeing inside like a human being, because it’s just too demoralizing to fight that restroom fight, to see people gasp when I enter. I get why Shrek lived in a swamp by himself. 

Here’s the thing: The more stridently I cried “I’M A LADY!!!”, the more it began to feel like I was fighting for an identity I didn’t even want. 

I thought about visual signals, but obvious things like a pink hat or a flowery rhinestone-blinged mask make me want to puke. I am not GIRLY. (I CAN, however, seriously rock a femme fatale pin-up look for special occasions.) I have invisible blond eyelashes and eyebrows, and I’ve begun dying my eyebrows to add some definition to my face without daily makeup. I often wear tinted sunblock too, which helps even out my complexion a bit. I sew my own masks, but still don’t want any that are too feminine. My day-off looks are cozy giant sweaters, comfy hiking pants, nerdy tshirts, and chucks, unless I particularly feel like twirling around in a skirt and a red lippy. Always black/gray/blue. Very vintage-inspired; I’m often called “timeless”.

The interesting thing is that I unearthed some “All About Me” projects I did around ages 5-9, and in those I said that my favorite colors were pink and purple, and that I hated black and gray. Little Me also loved “diamons” and was lonely when there was nobody around to play with. Little Me also used to dress up in Daddy’s clothes! I loved his boots as a toddler, and I wore his neckties and driving caps as a pre-teen. I remember that I liked feeling dapper. 

Being homeschooled, isolated, and introverted, and even commuting to college instead of dorming, meant that I never was traditionally socialized in the Art of Womanliness. My mom gave me some makeup for my 13th birthday, but Mom and I were far from close, so unwrapping it was all the instruction I got. I lived for a time amongst those strange creatures known as Southern Belles, and they infuriated me. Everything pink and dainty and monogrammed and artificial. The forced dichotomy of the genders made my blood boil.

Somehow I landed a magnificent specimen of a man who was attracted to my low-maintenance, nerdy energy, and he’s been surprisingly supportive as I process all of this. I’ve also told my sister and two close friends, and have had textbook-perfect responses of support. My new therapist thinks that gender identity = sexuality, and that since I’m attracted to men, I’m not enby, end of story. I’m trying to educate her. 

If I identify as female, then I need to reconcile the idea that I’m somehow “failing” womanhood by not presenting femme, by not being traditionally pretty, and by not valuing the things I’m told that women should value, and by not having kids.

If I identify as enby, then everything makes sense, EXCEPT the incontrovertible proof that Little Me did originally love pink and purple and “diamons”. 

What do YOU think? What should I consider as I process all of this? I am tremendously grateful to and inspired by each of you as I’ve watched from the wings.

I lived for a time amongst those strange creatures known as Southern Belles, and they infuriated me. Everything pink and dainty and monogrammed and artificial. The forced dichotomy of the genders made my blood boil.\n\nSomehow I landed a magnificent specimen of a man who was attracted to my low-maintenance, nerdy energy, and he’s been surprisingly supportive as I process all of this. I’ve also told my sister and two close friends, and have had textbook-perfect responses of support. My new therapist thinks that gender identity = sexuality, and that since I’m attracted to men, I’m not enby, end of story. I’m trying to educate her. \n\nIf I identify as female, then I need to reconcile the idea that I’m somehow “failing” womanhood by not presenting femme, by not being traditionally pretty, and by not valuing the things I’m told that women should value, and by not having kids.\n\nIf I identify as enby, then everything makes sense, EXCEPT the incontrovertible proof that Little Me did originally love pink and purple and “diamons”. \n\nWhat do YOU think? What should I consider as I process all of this? I am tremendously grateful to and inspired by each of you as I’ve watched from the wings.

2021-02-11 06:24:46,lhenr9,4,1,"Hey everyone, I was hoping to talk about something that's been on my mind. I have been really bothered by TERFs making this argument that people want to be Non-Binary because of internalized Misogyny for AFAB people. It bothers me because why does being a woman have to be what we have to be if we have trauma around misogyny?

I say this because after a lot of introspection what I have come to realize is I do have a lot of trauma due to being told all my life woman is this woman is that blah blah blah. I legit had to ask permission to get a job and was denied that permission in my 20s. I'm tired. Why is it some alarmist thing if I don't want to be this gender role that society invented? I adore strong women and women who are butch and women who are high femme boss bitches. I support all women! and I love the women who fight to make woman into something beyond these archaic gender roles! I want them to keep fighting to change this role into something more, but I don't want that role for me. I want something entirely else. I am genderfluid and sometimes I am feminine. When I am that I want to be feminine and my own gender identity that wasn't invented by someone else. I want it to be my gender identity. I hear the someone call me a woman and I feel so out of it just hearing it. Why is it a bad thing if I don't want to be a woman?

But the issue is if I say that people attack you for not being really trans, not being really non-binary, not being really anything. You're just a raving idiot, or a traumatize lunatic pushing your issues onto everyone and causing problems. It's why I don't like talking to anyone about any of this bc people flip their shit about the tiniest things. I experience gender dysphoria and yeah a lot of it is because of misogyny. A lot of it is bc I never was this. Why are AFAB people so demure and incapable that we're not allowed to know ourselves, and our own bodies, our own minds, and more? Why do we always need to be ""protected"" in a way that basically denies us agency? Why can't I say I want hormones and someone give it to m e bc that's what I want and I'm my own person. But the thing is if you are genderfluid like me and at any point you want to change back to feminine you can just take hormones again to be that. You can get breast implants if you want breasts again. Sure it's dramatic and I'm not going to do that myself, but all this concern trolling is just ridiculous because it's not like any of this is permanent. So many sexy amazing women have deep voices, it doesn't make you less of a woman if someone detransitions and they have a masculine appearance. You're just a boss bitch who had a genderfluid moment in your life. Why can't genderfluidity be beautiful instead of a horror story?

I realize this might sound crazy to folks, but am I wrong here? Why can't I reclaim femininity and be non-binary gender and maybe my desire for that be rooted in not wanting to associate with a gender which the role of being has been nothing but trauma for me. What if someone AFAB wants to be she/her but not a woman because they don't want that gender. Why can't that be enough?

so! for that purpose i’ve been looking around for and HEAVILY considering getting a binder! i’ve been doing research, and i’m pretty hopeful about it!

the problem is that i have other financial responsibilities that have to come first, and unfortunately getting a binder seems like almost a luxury/unnecessary item at this point. 

my question: is buying second hand binders a thing? is it a good idea? are there any lower price but still safe/good quality binder companies?

My family's favorite pic of me as a kid is of 4 y/o me coyly peeking out of a bush, but the backstory was I'd been hiding in there, crying, for 1-2hrs because I didn't want anyone to see me in my dress and they snapped the photo just as I was coaxed out. A lot of my childhood involved me doing things like hiding in my closet, sobbing ""god made a mistake, I'm not supposed to be a girl"", but all of that is a different story.

I spent my life until my teens presenting as masc and feeling happy about it...then the societal pressure of high school kicked in. I got a lot of ""nobody will ever love you unless you're a pretty young lady :)"" messaging and I could see my high femme chick friends being lavished with positive attention, so I started femme-ing it up like crazy too. This was then reinforced by the positive attention I got in turn. People were significantly nicer when I looked like a pretty girl. It felt/feels like a costume, like drag.

(Speaking of which, it turns out everybody else doesn't do drag king get ups when they're bored at home, how odd).

Anyway, I kept my short hair til my early-to-mid 20's, grew it out, got a lot of compliments aaaand...I hate it. So much. I 100% have hair dysphoria. Every day I think about cutting it off myself. I \*have\* butchered it on impulse before. It's always shoved up into a beanie or ponytail, to the point it gets matted. I despise it, but people tell me my face is too wide to pull off short hair/that my long hair is beautiful. To be (considered hot) or not to be (angry at my hair every day), that is the question.

I made a bit of an attempt to start reverting back to my androgynous look a few years ago; binding with ace bandages at home (I know, dangerous), wearing more masc clothes. I showed the guy I was dating that Ruby Rose video where they go from femme to masc, cried, told him ""I think I'm non-binary"", but he just made fun of me/seem repulsed, so I stopped. It set me back for years. I still worry it'll be hard to meet someone unless I look femme and pretty.

However, over quarantine, I've done a lot of thinking and talked with trans friends. I'm going to buy my first binder, I'm going to schedule a haircut, and I've been buying more androgynous/masc clothing. I'm gonna use the binder on a trial basis, just to see if it makes me feel better, if it does then I'll keep it up.

2021-02-12 20:41:52,lik8oe,0,1,"Hey everyone,

I'm writing this post because I'm in a sort of strange predicament. 

My partner is nonbinary, they've been out since 2015 (when we were in highschool together) and they used a binder I gave them, back then, pretty frequently. After high school, they went through a lot of bad things with their transphobic family, and they also had no choice but to live with transphobic and abusive partners who refused to acknowledge their gender identity, let alone validate it. While all this was happening, the binder I gave them got left behind- and they haven't really had the money or motivation to buy themself a new one since all those bad things happened to them. It also doesn't help that they spent years living with people who convinced them that they weren't trans, that being nonbinary isn't a real thing, that trans people in general don't actually deserve ""special treatment"" aka help for dysphoria.

Just recently, I finally convinced them to buy a GC2B binder for themself. A brand new, perfectly sized, expensive as f\*ck, GC2B. Only one problem - \*\*we got evicted by our transphobic landlord DAYS before it finally got delivered\*\*. So that was over $60cdn down the drain, and (from the looks of how they've been acting) a sign from god to my partner that they didn't actually deserve to experience gender euphoria.

How do I convince them that their dysphoria is real and valid enough to do something about? How do I convince them to stop considering it a ""waste of money"" if I were to buy them one? We're pretty poor, but I have enough in my minimal savings to buy them a new (obviously less great) binder from Amazon. Every time I bring it up, they just get mad at me, and I know for a fact that it's because they don't think they're worth the money, they don't think their mental health is important enough.

I don't know what to do. I just want to help, but it seems like I'm just making things worse. If anyone has any advice, it would be very much appreciated.

2021-02-13 03:24:39,lis3mf,1,1,"Okay so literally for as long as I can remember I've known I wasn't a boy. Like, idk, just KNEW.

Back when I was like, pre-15 I thought this meant I was a girl. Cus ya know, there's two options and if you one then...

This lead to what I might describe as ""hell"". This whole ""damn okay I'm a girl"" but also ""eww eww fuck that's gross nope"" leading to a meltdown of gross dysphoric shit.


Around age 15/16 I found out about being ""gender fluid"" (and other NB genders shortly after) and idk something just kinda... Clicked. I wasn't really sure tho, a large part of me didn't really believe this was a real thing people were so I kinda ignored it and stayed in dysphoria zone, if anything just cus id spent so long fighting myself thinking I wanted to be a girl and I was just in denial, an egg refusing to hatch (even if hatching felt completely not me and disgusting).

Very very slowly I started calling myself nonbinary. Mostly just to try it on. It didn't feel ""right"" but damn if I had to choose between being a dude and feeling wrong and being a girl and feeling gross, I'd take ""neutral"" any day.

I've kinda never understood what gender is. Idk. I don't feel a gender, but at the same time I really do its just... Not one of them. So I thought fuck it, and bought something purely femme, a pair of heels.

They came, and I put them on. O was so excited and nervous and I kinda knew inside of myself that this was it. My turning point. If I hate them then I'm a boy, if I love them I'm a girl. Idk why this just felt like, concrete. How it worked.

I put them on and they were okay

Just okay

""They're... Shoes"" I remember thinking. I kinda liked them, I kinda didn't like some parts.

No weird validation. No new feelings. Nothing masc or fem in my brain finally kicking into gear cus I don't think I can do that, the whole masc fem shit.

I have no clue why a pair of heels is what it took. But yeah. I finally tested my femme side to see if that's been there dormant and it wasn't.



It's going to sound bad but I'm so glad. The thought of being binary trans has always felt as wrong as being cis, it's had that gross ""nope please no"" feeling for as long as I can think. there's nothing wrong with being binary trans it's just... I mean it's just as dysphoric feeling for me as being binary-cis lol.

This whole ""damn okay I\'m a girl"" but also ""eww eww fuck that\'s gross nope"" leading to a meltdown of gross dysphoric shit.\n\n\nAround age 15/16 I found out about being ""gender fluid"" (and other NB genders shortly after) and idk something just kinda... Clicked. I wasn\'t really sure tho, a large part of me didn\'t really believe this was a real thing people were so I kinda ignored it and stayed in dysphoria zone, if anything just cus id spent so long fighting myself thinking I wanted to be a girl and I was just in denial, an egg refusing to hatch (even if hatching felt completely not me and disgusting).\n\nVery very slowly I started calling myself nonbinary. Mostly just to try it on. It didn\'t feel ""right"" but damn if I had to choose between being a dude and feeling wrong and being a girl and feeling gross, I\'d take ""neutral"" any day.\n\nI\'ve kinda never understood what gender is. Idk. I don\'t feel a gender, but at the same time I really do its just... Not one of them. So I thought fuck it, and bought something purely femme, a pair of heels.\n\nThey came, and I put them on. O was so excited and nervous and I kinda knew inside of myself that this was it. My turning point. If I hate them then I\'m a boy, if I love them I\'m a girl. Idk why this just felt like, concrete. How it worked.\n\nI put them on and they were okay\n\nJust okay\n\n""They\'re... Shoes"" I remember thinking. I kinda liked them, I kinda didn\'t like some parts.\n\nNo weird validation. No new feelings. Nothing masc or fem in my brain finally kicking into gear cus I don\'t think I can do that, the whole masc fem shit.\n\nI have no clue why a pair of heels is what it took. But yeah. I finally tested my femme side to see if that\'s been there dormant and it wasn\'t.\n\n\n\nIt\'s going to sound bad but I\'m so glad.

2021-02-13 06:53:53,live1b,5,1,"Hi all, I'm looking for advice in writing a non-binary character in a novel I'm working on. Namely, I'm hoping to avoid some pitfalls in misrepresenting the character.

As some background, Sam is a cinematographer for a production crew trying to get a film off the ground. They're an integral part of the crew and contribute a lot to the discussions regarding the film/story and interact with everyone in the book to some extent. Whilst they're not the main character, they do go through a character arc of becoming more assertive and not relying solely on others for positive affirmation.

Their non-binary identity is only highlighted in two sections. Some more characters join the film crew to help, and these new members misgender Sam twice - once as male, and then later as female. This isn't played for laughs, but instead more as a way of reinforcing the fact that these extra characters don't click with the original crew. When Sam is misgendered, they get first annoyed and then frustrated, but corrects them quickly on both points. The crew shares this sentiment.

Personally I feel pretty ok with the character, but I'm worried that I'm blindsided by things I don't know.

Good Morning all! I am a graduate student at Emerson College in Boston, MA studying Speech-Language Pathology. I am conducting a survey-based research project exploring client perceptions of gender affirming voice therapy to support voice feminization. The project seeks to explore which voice therapy methods clients find most helpful and how gender affirming voice therapy supports clients’ overall voice satisfaction. 

If you would consider participating and/or sharing my project with those in your networks who may be interested and eligible to participate, I would greatly appreciate it. More details about the research and the survey itself can be found at the link below. I thank you in advance for your time, support, and contributions to this project.

Eligibility and benefits. If you are transgender, non-binary, and/or gender non-conforming and have previously attended gender-affirming voice therapy to support voice feminization, you qualify to participate in this study. Participation is completely voluntary and you may discontinue at any time without consequence. Once the survey period has closed (March 2021), three participants will be chosen at random to receive a $100 gift card.

2021-02-13 17:10:06,lj4ibb,1,1,"Hi all. I'm 38 and it's been at least 7 years of gender questioning. I originally came out as a butch lesbian in college, and even in my 20s when trans men became to appear in public a bit more, I still didn't identify. The fact was that during my entire 20s it was 100% assumed that if you were genderqueer or as one would say now don't fit the binary you would not have surgery of be taking hormones. Then with representations on The L Word especially Shane sporting a way of embodying masculinity that still was pretty and for whom having breasts etc was no threat to her masculinity, it was an empowering image. Yet today, as a younger friend pointing out when watching the show for the first time this year, this person would be identified as trans, expected to consider top surgery hormones etc. At the time I got to a point of truly being comfortable in my body with all its gender contradictions and really owning that. In terms of my own journey.  In the last 7 or so years, I've experienced increased gender dysphoria that still hasn't resolved itself. It's my chest/breasts yes which over time have gotten somewhat bigger than they were but also it's just my overall sense that something isn't ""getting through"" in terms of how I look. In other words, I feel feminized in a way I never used to. The gender codes have changed, as they likely should, yet this puts me in an awkward position. I really like my breasts too and love how I look but then I also get many flashes of dysphoria and feel frustrated. Moreover I am non-binary and there's no one real body that fits me easily.  I find myself so jealous of people who are very clear on what they want in transition, and especially of binary trans people who just really know and have a very clear path of what to do.  I would love to ""figure it out""! I would do whatever my soul truly wants but frankly it feels like my soul wants multiple things. But in this world, we can't stop hormones in their tracks and freeze the results in the middle (if only! right? do yall feel me!) nor can a person have multiple bodies or even go back once a surgery has been performed. All the this puts incredibly pressure on this and leaves me in a state of stasis, so the process just goes on. I tried T for just a few weeks and it was ok but I also know it would only be a matter of time until it would get me passing or else id have to eventually go off. And I would only want about 50% of the changes, so for me that's not really a solution. I vacilate between wanting a breast reduction or traditional top surgery. I find this so hard and confusing. Is anyone else confused out there? It makes me nostalgic, frankly, for when bodies didn't seem to matter so much. And yet we are so much more trans friendly and informed these days and so trust me ethically and politically I don't regret that things have changed but damn this is hard. Does anyone feel me? Anyone my age witness the transition in queer culture I'm taking about: how the role of the body for non-binaries changed and now we have more options but also more frustration bc it's assumed we need to represent who we are on our body?

2021-02-13 22:49:20,ljbbxa,1,1,"Hi, so I’m writing this bc I’m almost certain I’m non binary but I just need reassurance from other queer people. I also haven’t came out to anyone yet so I think it will feel nice to tell someone. This might be tmi but also I just have a lot of things I need to tell someone.

I’ve always felt like there was something horribly wrong w me and I’ve kinda always chalked it up to depression and just ya know not being nerotypical. But I’ve herd a lot of trans people kinda describe having the same feelings witch always kinda stood out to me but I still didn’t really think I was trans. When I was a kid I saw myself as both a girly girl and a tomboy and was always super frustrated that most people assumed you could only be one and not the other. (I’m 23 and AFAB) I remember even as a seven year old being aware of sexism and misogyny even though I didn’t have the sophisticated words to explain it. Gender has always felt like something that’s constrained me rather than solidify my identity the way I guess it does for cis people. When I thought about it more, me being a women seemed like it was more for other peoples comfort than my own.  
 For most of my life I assumed I was just a gender non conforming woman but recently I’ve just been doing a lot of self reflection. The pandemic has sucked a lot but being alone w myself has sort of forced me to spend time unpacking my gender trauma. It’s also given me the space to experiment with the way I look without having to perceived and judged by others. This is gonna sound silly but I saw this tik tok 3 months ago where someone said “cis people don’t spend hours questioning their gender” and I was like “wait..they don’t???” And Ive always kinda wanted to be non binary but thought I couldn’t be bc my body is very fem and I just though I was too fem to ever be non-binary (witch I’m now realizing is actually pretty transphobic but I’m trying to not be so transphobic towards myself). So recently Ive started very seriously reading and watching non binary people tell their stories and the more a learn the more sure I become. I feel like when I come out to people they might be shocked or feel like its out of the blue but  the more I look back, the more I realized the signs have always been there I just wasn’t viewing my own feelings as valid.

There have been a few times were random men on the street mistook me for a man. Both times it weirdly felt good to not only be mistaken for a man but to actually have a man look at me and not see me as a women. I’ve always had feelings of wishing I wasn’t a women but I feel like most women feel that from time to time but this was different. I remember feeling so good and thinking... “wait, am I a trans man?” And then immediately dismissing it thinking “no, I man not a man. I don’t want to be a man everyday of my life.” I thought bc I knew I wasn’t a man that meant I couldn’t be trans. Then another time one of my coworkers who was no binary assumed I was non binary and that felt soooooo good. Once again I loved the feeling of someone not assume if I was a women. Yet I still didn’t think I was non binary lol. Thinking back on this I now understand that good feeling is gender euphoria and that feeling of being horribly wrong was probably partially gender dysphoria. 
In the past year I was dating a cis guy and even though I had real feelings for him and was very sexually attracted to him we couldn’t make it work. I generally prefer to date men but I’m always really aware that I’m “the girl” in the relationship and I hate it. This guy in particular didn’t treat me like that and I loved it but there was just a lot of other shit that got in the way. Being with him scared me a lot because everything I was shoving down and dismissing came right back up into the spotlight. I hadn’t dated anyone for YEARS before him so it was easier just to sweep my gender stuff under the rug. I had a really hard defining our relationship bc i didn’t want to use words like boyfriend and girlfriend. There was so much I wasn’t ready to tell him (or anyone) that I knew I needed to work though. Even though at some points I felt like he knew (ie. him complimenting my masc outfits and him telling me he thought Tilda Swinton was hot) I still couldn’t admit it to him.
I think even though I was experiencing these weird gender feelings I didn’t think I was non binary enough to be non binary. I thought me saying Im non binary when I’m not 100% certain would somehow undermine people who knew for sure they are non binary. I know that’s sounds stupid but I’m starting to realize all these weird transphobic things I’ll say to my self that'd I’d never say to another person and that I know is transphobic but I’ll still use it as a reason not to be myself. Like i remember years ago likening the way a compression sports bra felt on me and thinking “maybe I should try binding” and immediately thinking “what’s the point everyone will still be able to tell you have tits” and “you’re not gonna fool anyone” so I’m trying hard to reframe my way of thinking about my self. I’ve known about non binary people for a while and have had non binary friends. I guess I just never thought I was non binary because I was able to still embrace my masculinity as a women with out people (or even myself) really questioning it. But I also guess I never understood that I get a choice. Ive always have had such a problem with how people perceive me being so far off from who I truly feel I am. My assigned gender has always just made me feel so trapped and uncomfortable but I don’t think being a man would make me feel any less trapped. Ugh but it’s hard bc I don’t have a solid answer to my gender and I guess that’s why I think I am non binary. 
It’s also really hard for me to navigate because I’m still questioning my sexuality too. When I was younger i always had crushes on boys but a lot of the time I’d have a crush on someone then get to know them and realize I didn’t like them as much as I thought I would. I think a lot of my attrition to boys has do more with me wanting to be them rather than always wanting to be with them. After dating a few guys when I was a teenager thought I might be ace. But then I fell I love with my best friend (who was bi when we were together but then came out as non-binary when we where older and not dating but still close friends) and so I thought I was demisexual and I went w that for a while. When I was first meeting new people in my freshman year of collage I would tell people I was demi (yes everybody, even the gays, gave me weird looks) but that was like the closest thing to coming out I’ve ever had to do. Even though I am more acesexual then most people I honestly do want to experience being in love and having a partner at some point in my life especially now as adult. There were also a few other people that I was in flirtationships with but never actually dated both of whom came out as trans later so I was like hmm that might mean something. Ive read that trans people are very good at finding other trans people even before they transition. Ive alway had a lot of lgbtq friends and always felt most at home in lgbtq spaces but also always sort of felt alone bc of my lack of sexuality and a general aversion to romance. I’ve never really met a women I wanted to date/ fuck but I defiantly wouldn’t say it could never happen (I went to senior prom with a lesbian who is a straight trans guy now so I don’t think that counts lol). As an AFAB loving women in a romantic or sexual way has never been part of my identity and in that way I felt disconnected to queerness. I’m think I’m starting to realize my queerness has a lot more to do with my own gender expression than the gender of my partners.
 I’m really realizing that the life I’m going to live and the family I’m going to build is going to look very different then what I was told your life should look like. I’ve never wanted to use my body to have a kid. People always told me I’d probably change my mind when I got older but I don’t really see that happening. This is probably the thing I’m most afraid to tell my mom bc I’m afraid she’ll be disappointed even though I defiantly see myself adopting or fostering. Since realizing I’m non-binary I’ve felt the best about my body that a have in my entire life. All non binary bodies are different and that’s been really empowering to me. As a non binary person I can love my boobs but also love my body hair. There’s no wrong or right way for a non binary body to look and that’s the best part. We are who we are despite the assumptions about our bodies.

 I hope once I’m out as non binary It will be easier for me to understand my sexuality and I guess just my identity overall. I’m wondering if there are other non-binary or trans people who can relate to feeling ace but not wanting to be ace? Dose anyone have any insight on how your sexuality might change once you’re actually living as you’re true gender? Hopefully I’ll be more comfortable in emotional and physically intimate relationships when I don’t have to repress this huge part of myself. Sorry this rant is so long and honestly this ain’t even the half of it. I just really needed to come out to someone and put these feeling into words. Most of the things I’ve talked about in this post I’ve never talked about with anyone but I want that to change and I think this is a good first step. I also hope this might help other people like me that feel very alone. My 2021 goal is to get into therapy so I can talks to someone about all this. I will come out to my friends and family eventually and I know they’ll support me but I feel like it’s still really new to me and I’m still remembering things from my past that I haven’t quite dealt with.

2021-02-14 00:19:39,ljd0n8,3,1,"""Gender is a social construct"" is a sentence I see thrown around a lot in the nonbinary community. It seems that those who write or say it have 2 particlar meanings in mind:

1) Gender roles are a social construct.

or

2) Gender in the sense of gender identity is a social construct, meaning that every diiference between men amd women is contributed to nurture instead of nature.

&amp;#x200B;

Many mean the first meaning, and inarguably, gender roles are socially conatructed - unless you believe that biology dictates a woman to wear makeup, etc. And I think in this community we can all agree that gender roles succ ass.

The problems arise when, due to this inprecise use of language, people come to believe that your intended meaning was the second.

Problem no. 1 is the following: The statement that gender is socially constructed is factually incorrect. Scientific evidence and statistical averages show differences in female and male brains and behaviors that cannot be explained by anyting but innately biological differences. Women and men are not blank slates at birth and differences that show themselves are therefore not socially constructed, but biological. I don't deny however that upbringing and social expectations have now effect at all, but they do now outweigh biology.

Problem no. 2: That gender is a social construct was put forth by TERFs (Trans-exclusionary radical feminists) in order to discriminate against binary trans people, in particular trans women. It is used to devalidate their gender experience, because as you may know, it has in fact been shown that trans women are born in male bodies with a female typical brain and vice versa. The ""gender is a social construct"" card is thus used as an attempt to refute the argument that trans people are born trans and it is not a choice.

Problem no. 3: People skeptical of nonbinary like to look at our (perhaps only apparent) belief of gender being a social construct. Because, as mentioned above, gender is proven to be in fact partially biological they throw all enbies into the ""irrational science denier that places their own belief above facts"" pot, which is not true for many of us and certainly doesn't help us and our identity in being accepted.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been seeing all these posts on Tik Tok from plus size creators (I'm plus size) of ""when I hated my body I dressed like"" and it's more baggy, non-feminine, modest clothes, and then it transitions to ""verus how I dressed when I loved my body"" and it's ultra-feminine, low cut, tight, revealing clothes. 

This trend specifically has really been affecting me (not the creators fault it just has). I only recently have come to realize that I don't believe I'm cis, and I was only dressing ultra feminine and revealing and such because I thought as a plus size person that was the only way I could be perceived as anything other than dirty and lazy.

I only recently have started to reject that and now show no cleavage and don't wear very many tight things as it really makes me uncomfortable with how feminine I get perceived when I do so My ideal presentation is I'd say right now is fluid on the spectrum between feminine and nothing, never reaching either point fully but fluctuating in between (never masculine though) and always having balance.

I'm back to feeling gross and sloppy though after seeing this trend, and I wonder if anyone had any thoughts on it? I feel stuck because the way I want to dress (more feminine) doesn't match with my very ""curvy"" body, so instead I have to dress less feminine to feel more comfortable in my body, but then sometimes I think people see me as sloppy or lazy or insecure. It's like because of my shape I wear oversized men's t shirts with bike shorts or huge pants and a high necekd t shirt I tie to crop. But if I wasn't shaped this way I'd wear things like florals and maybe even dressed (it's been years lol) and such without feeling I'm too far on the spectrum.

My whole life I've self identified as a straight cis dude, and I was pretty confortable living like that. I never questioned my sexuality or gender, I came as cishet as they come. The ""problem"" started after I started attending therapy (Turns out that a decade of abuse from a family member and from a group of ""friends"" does some shit to someones psiche).

During my sessions, I had for the first time the opportunity to do some actual reflection about  myself, the world around me and my place in it without the without being clouded by social anxiety. And I came out it different in a couple of ways: I was able to mostly let go of past traumas: And I began expressing myself in a way that felt authentic to me, and thats where the confusion started. I started being more confortable in being less masculine than my country expects of men, I expressed my emontions without the fear of being perceived as weak. This may sound like common sense, but in my country this is usually frowned upon by most men.

At some point I realized that when someone called me a man, It didn't feel right. I wasn't uncomfortable or anything, It just sounded strange, like ""Huh... that doesn't sound like it should be referring to me"". And only then I started to connect the dots with the NB community. 

I've been immersed in the LBTQIA+ community my whole life (Aside from my cringy 2014 ""Feminist owned compilation #3074). I was lucky enough to have very progressive parents, so I was pretty familiar with the concept of non-binary folks, and I made connections between my own feelings and the experiences of some members of the community. For a short while, I asked some of online friends to refer to me with gender neutral pronouns (They don't exist in my mother tongue so this was the best I could do). That experience taught me two thing, that it feels right when someone calls me a ""they"", and that male pronouns don't bother me, so the my ideal pronouns would be He/they. 

But at some point, I began to think, do I, a AMAB, masculine presenting. He/they person deserve call myself a part of the community? My life would be unaffected, since I would be to afraid to correct someone when they refer to me as a men. The most ""radical"" things that I've got going on for me are my painted nails and my long-ish hair (which even in my backwards ass country have been mostly normalized in more progressive circles). Can I really stand beside the people that normalized those things to begin with? How do I know that I'm just a cishet dude trying to infiltrate a warm, and friendly  community ?

The ""problem"" started after I started attending therapy (Turns out that a decade of abuse from a family member and from a group of ""friends"" does some shit to someones psiche).\n\nDuring my sessions, I had for the first time the opportunity to do some actual reflection about  myself, the world around me and my place in it without the without being clouded by social anxiety. And I came out it different in a couple of ways: I was able to mostly let go of past traumas: And I began expressing myself in a way that felt authentic to me, and thats where the confusion started. I started being more confortable in being less masculine than my country expects of men, I expressed my emontions without the fear of being perceived as weak. This may sound like common sense, but in my country this is usually frowned upon by most men.\n\nAt some point I realized that when someone called me a man, It didn\'t feel right. I wasn\'t uncomfortable or anything, It just sounded strange, like ""Huh... that doesn\'t sound like it should be referring to me"". And only then I started to connect the dots with the NB community. \n\nI\'ve been immersed in the LBTQIA+ community my whole life (Aside from my cringy 2014 ""Feminist owned compilation #3074). I was lucky enough to have very progressive parents, so I was pretty familiar with the concept of non-binary folks, and I made connections between my own feelings and the experiences of some members of the community. For a short while, I asked some of online friends to refer to me with gender neutral pronouns (They don\'t exist in my mother tongue so this was the best I could do). That experience taught me two thing, that it feels right when someone calls me a ""they"", and that male pronouns don\'t bother me, so the my ideal pronouns would be He/they. \n\nBut at some point, I began to think, do I, a AMAB, masculine presenting. He/they person deserve call myself a part of the community? My life would be unaffected, since I would be to afraid to correct someone when they refer to me as a men. The most ""radical"" things that I\'ve got going on for me are my painted nails and my long-ish hair (which even in my backwards ass country have been mostly normalized in more progressive circles). Can I really stand beside the people that normalized those things to begin with? How do I know that I\'m just a cishet dude trying to infiltrate a warm, and friendly  community ?\n\nI\'m so f\\*\\*\\*ing tired of doubting myself.

2021-02-15 04:42:29,lk5w4k,2,1,"I'm (was?) female, 212. I have recently come out as asexual and (pan??) but I'm still figuring out those identities, I sort of am really fluid with that stuff so what fits one day may not fit another but those are the identities that fit the best spectrum that I sit on. 

Recently I've realised that I may be non binary. The things that make me think that are:

I've always hated, HATED my breasts. Ever since puberty I've always thought they looked horrible in the mirror and I kept the nipples covered all the time no matter what, even so I couldn't see them, because they made me feel depressed and disgusted. Breastfeeding has improved that feeling of disgust when seeing them somewhat but I still don't like them outside of that. I'm borderline obsessed with getting a binder. 

When I pictured the ideal version of myself in my head I couldn't actually pinpoint what my face would look like. I know what my body would look like - tiny, slim, smooth, hairless, featureless, no or very little breasts. 

My hair causes me torment often. Some days I want long, waist length hair, other days very short or shaved. 

I changed my name legally because I hated my birth name. All the names sounded weird except the ones that were gender neutral. My name is now gender neutral but my middle names are feminine. 

I hate my voice. I don't know what about it I hate but I just hate it. It doesn't sound like me. 

I have days where I wear dresses and dress up in makeup. I'm uncomfortable in dresses but I like how they make me look. I have days where I keep my hair tied back and wear boots and jeans and tshirts. 

I am already using she/they pronouns. I really like the idea of being a they. 

When considering being non-binary I cried a bit because it would make sense and also because it meant I'm a little less of a weirdo and am able to describe myself better.

Things that make me conflicted and make me think I'm not non-binary and being stupid: 

I also like being a she. 

I like how people treat me nicely because I'm clearly a girl, and also non threatening/small (e.g. strangers going out of their way to help me, calling me endearing terms)

I really enjoy getting dressed up and doing over the top makeup. 

I'd say I feel feminine 70% of the time, andro 29% and masc 1% of the time. Like, barely masc if at all. Basically just a cis female.

I flip flop on sexuality and I know that's okay but inside I feel like it isn't okay and that's a sign that I'm faking being ace/pan. It makes me feel horrible. I feel like adding gender to that will make it worse and is also disrespectful to trans and nbi people. 

I'm scared of how people would react and ridicule me. I don't want to deal with that. It would destroy me if people I looked up to laughed or treated me differently. I feel like that in itself is a sign that I clearly couldn't be *that* nonbinary if I even am because I'm so scared of how people would react that I'd rather not say it. I feel that people who are legitimately non binary come out because they need to even if they are treated differently because of it.

2021-02-15 17:49:54,lkiumk,5,1,"Hello! I apologize if I am disrupting anyone's day but I feel like I need to ask questions, I have so many of them and it's causing me to lose my mind. I also apologize if I am putting this in the wrong subreddit, place or anything. I am not on reddit too often. So, here we go. For a few months now I have been starting to feel disconnected with my gender (I am afab) It's nothing strong, I am fine with my body, but I tend to wear more neutral things, though I will wear feminine stuff occasionally. Sometimes I feel fine, just going along with my day and other times I feel like I am having a gender crisis and I have no clue what's happening. I feel like I'm faking it, trying to find a way to justify these confusing feelings. Because I've never questioned my gender before. Until I started using she/they pronouns last year. Ever since then it's been a slow build up to getting more and more disconnected to my gender. I feel like if I just wait long enough answers would come. But it's almost every day now where I question this, where something happens and it sets off a chain of events in my head of me wondering who I am. Everytime someone uses the pronouns she/her for me, I just don't feel like myself anymore, like they still fit, somewhat but it doesn't feel as natural as they/them. So I have grown to use they/them more for me. But I don't know if that's me just trying to be different, or me genuinely feeling uncomfortable. But the confusing thing for me is other than my pronouns I feel mostly fine with my body, other than I don't really like to wear anything too utterly feminine. Sometimes I feel fine wearing more of a feminine neutral look, and sometimes I want to wear more neutral clothes. They/them just brings me happiness, like pure bliss whenever someone uses them for me, and once again I don't know if that's just me loving being different or getting gender euphoria. I found the term demi-girl after having one of the worst crisis I've had yet. It felt like it justified everything I was feeling. But a lot of the definitions are ""having a small, barely, weak connection to your assigned gender"" but I'm not entirely sure that's me, because other than the occasional body thing and being disconnected from she/her pronouns I'm not sure if it fits. It's all so confusing, I've looked at basically every site, question, etc to try to see if it fits me, and I feel like it does. I've scoured this subreddit and it's helped with a lot of questions, but they don't answer all of my questions and I feel like I need to post my story to get some sort of answers. This is also one of those things where I feel like I am making all of this up, that I'm faking it. Because this is so new to me, and I don't know how to go about it. This all probably sounds all over the place, and so confusing, I am so sorry for anyone reading this I just need answers.

The people who I'm not out to accept me for ""me"" without knowing the nonbinary thing (parents, my religious friends). Until a few weeks ago I didn't feel uncomfortable about my name. But now I suddenly do; big bummer. 

I maybe want to change my name and have a couple of options. I have three given names and use the second one because even my parents hate the first one (long story). I could use my third name, which is an (uncommon) girl's name and also the name of a tree. I like it a lot but my family will never accept me using that name because it's the name of a very good friend of my parents, who died a few months before I was born. 

The second option is to use a variation on the name I currently use. There's a very straightforward variation on my name that's a boy's name in a very specific part of the country, where I'm partially from, in the rest of the country it's a girl's name. Some people already call me this name because it's very similar and they're confused. Telling people, who I've yelled at that my name isn't ---e but ---a that my name is now ---e is going to be very difficult. 

Third option is the name Sef. I like how simple it is and how it sounds. I'm not sure how to test out names because most of my friends who've come out come out in the ""Hey I'm a \[gender\], my pronouns are \[   \] and my name is \[name\] kthxbai"" way.

1. Would it be okay to be non-binary but still dress somewhat feminine and not look what you would say gender non-conforming? I am afab by the way. There are surprisingly not enough good resources out there about this question. I feel like if I were to still dress how I dress now it would confuse people. I dress mostly neutral, with occasionally wearing feminine clothing. But I don't know, this is all still so new to me.

2. Would it be okay to just use non-binary as a umbrella term? Kind of like how I use Queer as an umbrella term for my sexuality? From what I have read, it seems to be put that way but I just want to make sure. I feel as though none of the gender labels fit me quite correctly, and as the same as my sexuality worrying about it too much stressed me out.

3. Are there any good resources you guys could give to help me read more about non-binary or other things?

2021-02-16 20:30:32,llcv6n,4,1,"Hi everyone!

I'm writing a fantasy story and my protagonist's father is a masculine enby. 

This character's arc will not center on his gender identity, I don't yet know if it will come up in a way that cis people will even recognize, but it *is* going to be an aspect of his character. 

Personally, I'm a cis asexual woman, but I know the term ""enby"" is possibly even more diverse than the ace umbrella, and I understand there is no *one* correct way to write an enby. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, is this a reasonable way to experience one's gender, or are there any mutually exclusive things going on here?

· Doesn’t mind male pronouns (though he feels a little disconnected from them) but he gets little kicks out of being referred to in neutral ways, such as the “the Crown” (which happens, because he is also the King).

· Feels weird about his own likeness in mirrors and pictures. That can’t be accurate—though he couldn’t point out the flaw to save his own life. 

· In public he has to present strictly male, but in private family settings, he prefers to keep his hair in a tight braid (cutting it is out of the question; keeping it away is the next best thing (and it’s not that he dislikes his long hair, it’s just that it's the mark of an adult, and adults are gendered in a way that children are not, but the King cannot outright present himself as a child)). He keeps it free of both metal beads (which are masculine) and ribbons (which are feminine), but sometimes puts in glass ornaments or colourful flowers (which are not weird things for anyone to have in their hair, if the occasion is fancy enough). 

· Likes tight clothing and tries to give himself a bit of a feminine waist. Otherwise very happy with his height and very masculine face and form. There is no way he’s ever passing for a woman, or even a little androgenous, nor would he want to. 

· He has no outright dysphoria, but he kind of wishes he didn’t have any nipples. He’s almost never fully naked, and he usually has sex more or less half-dressed or with his nightshirt on. 

· When he was a kid, he used to be such an unruly brat, but then he had to grow up and assume his office. 

&amp;#x200B;

Would you recognize this as an enby?

Would you relate to this character?

I need some help.
My little sibling (12yo)
Just told us they want to be referred to as They/He from now on. (more They then He)

My sibling is only 12 and is Autistic so the situation is difficult. Not at all because we don't love and respect Them, of course as a trans man my sibling is being listened to and loved and we are working on using the correct pronouns. They are aware this is a safe loving home for Them to be Themselves. 

But I need some help, They don't fully understand Nonbinary/Gender fluid/trans. I'm trying to find interesting videos on YouTube that can help Them better understand these genders. But because They're autistic these videos need to hold their attention.

The videos being funny would really really help. Like someone reading reddit memes and stuff like that would really really help.

I've already found some 'One Topic' videos that will help but I need more and I'm a little overwhelmed. So if any of you have any videos or YouTubers you would recommend for a young autistic trans child that would really really help us!

(Oh I completely forgot to add, They've show a lot of interest in breast reduction surgery. (not full top surgery but we don't think They fully understand either yet) Their breasts are currently 32F but They've been 32J before. I'll remind you They are only 12yo.

I’m a 20-something AFAB. I’ve never really felt like a ‘woman’ in the broad sense but at the same time, I’ve always shirked from feeling like a ‘man’. I just see myself as me, and even then I’ve been struggling with things as simple as my sexual orientation. I call myself ‘queer’ only because I can’t see myself as any specific label.

I usually wear more feminine coding clothing at work (dresses) but in a casual setting I wear more masc geared stuff like button-ups and binders. I’ve worn binders for a couple years now, and have generally always seen them as nice to wear for t-shirts and button-ups.

I use she/her pronouns because that’s what I’ve always used, but sometimes I think about the possibility of using they/them. I’ve also recently caught myself fantasizing about what it would be like to go by a more masculine version of my name and finding the idea really appealing.

All of my close long term friends are trans and I’m the only cis person in our group, so I feel this irrational sense of anxiety that I’m only feeling like this in an attempt to ‘fit in’I- like I’m an imposter. know that sounds really childish, but it’s just a fear I have that I’m not sure how to overcome. Sadly, I don’t have access to therapy either.

I feel confused and scared and would love any kind of resources, books or whatnot, to try and help me suss out what I think I’ve been feeling for a while not without really processing it.

I'm 14 AFAB questioning my gender. Ive posted on the Demigirl and (I think) Bigender spaces before, but I was in a pretty tough time then. Now, I think I'm nonbinary. Or at least I /feel/ nonbinary; I want to be nonbinary, if that makes sense. I'd be happier if I wasn't cis (which... is a big clue that I'm nonbinary I think, but I still doubt myself a lot). 

The thing is, it feels like I'm faking it, because sometimes I don't notice gendered terms at all. Just oh cool, okay, moving on. And other times, like right now, terms and pronouns stick out to me-- anything gendered is in like, BIG bolded letters, and it really rubs me the wrong way. I just wanna say ""fuck you"" to gender, y'know? Sometimes, I can't care less about how I look, and other times I look in the mirror and think ""Wow, I hate that"", but that's practically it. No extreme body dysphoria, I think. I just want to be my own identity, no gender; a fluid moving flesh ball with a brain and leave it at that. 

I'm not too sure what to do with my pronouns either because I have no one to try ""they/them"" with, even though I want to. It feels kinda wrong doing so as if I'm not ""nonbinary enough"" (which obviously makes no sense and is problematic on its own terms). 

Problem is I want to be nonbinary, but I don't want to deal with any of the consequences on being nonbinary.

2021-02-18 09:49:57,lmj51y,5,1,"The idea of a ""creative nothing"" comes from the 19th-century philosopher Max Stirner in his magnum opus, ""The Unique and its Property"".

What does the creative nothing describe? It describes not a literal nothingness or a void, but this ""nothing"" is *your* nothing. Stirner believes that, although determinations of individuals (Man, Woman, Gay, Black, Chinese, American, etc. etc.) can describe a part of the individual, they fall far short. They can never fully describe what that individual is. So, then, if no word or set of words can ever conceptually describe you, what are you? To Stirner, you are ""nothing"".

""You aren't a word, you aren't a concept, you aren't an idea. You're more than all of this. You are Unique""^(1). A word is merely a word, it is not you, and as such, it can never define you in your entirety. 

Stirner points out that when people are *given* a conceptual identity, they are then expected to abide by the social functions and conditions that are associated with that conceptual identity - a huge error in the individual's ability to be their genuine selves, as we already established, you aren't a concept.

Words act as descriptors of your Self, but should never be substituted for your Self. It is you that commands your descriptors and not the other way around. Think of the common enby adage ""You don't owe anyone androgyny"", as this is the clearest form of rejecting the social baggage that comes with ""being non-binary"". People; society, expect you to be this and that way for having ""non-binary"" as a descriptor of your Self, but it is in the rejection of their keen expectation to exist in such and such way that you become a more genuine you - unique.

""If we are to go “towards the Creative Nothing”, as Novatore wrote, then we merely need to realize that we are already the creative nothing, that each of us, in our unique, lived and experienced existences, is creating ourselves from the creative nothing at every moment, and that all concepts and ideas are nothing but words to us, which we may use and destroy at our will.""^(2)

Being non-binary is a harsh rejection of gender descriptors, instantaneously from the outset defying and obliterating every social expectation that comes of you for merely being born. It's a rejection of upholding femininity or masculinity for the sake of being born as a socially feminine or masculine empty canvas, but for enjoying feminity and masculinity because you have decided it's what you want to enjoy. You needn't a textbook, nor social pressures, to inform you of your favourite colour, clothes, mannerisms, hobbies, or household role.

I am curious as to why do some people prefer to use neopronouns over ""they/them""? 
I have read somewhere that it might be because ""they"" started as a plural pronoun and it might not be grammatically correct or accepted in formal settings. If this is the reason, wouldn't it just be easier to just try to push they into this settings. In fact, there are a lot of companies/institutions that already accept this, for instance. 
It is quite obvious that neopronouns are being used as a way to mock the lgbtq+ community, specifically the non binary community. And a lot of lgbtq+ people are excluding themselves from this fight and a lot of division is happening. What are your thoughts on this?

Had the epiphany that I was Nonbinary 2.5 months ago and have been thinking about it constantly since.

Here is how I know:

My girlfriend in highschool asked me if I thought I might be transgender. I remember not being able to figure out the gender issue and just giving up and calling myself queer.

Years of working out a lot and gaining muscle and losing fat liking how it made me look more masculine/androgynous and shrank my chest. My spouse commented that it did not look like I had a female body from that angle when I was doing pull-ups and that felt good! At least since late middle/highschool liked being seen as strong and masculine. 

Convinced my mom to let me cut my hair short at a young age, pre-middle school - beginning of puberty? Shaved it in middle school and have had it shaved off and on for years since. Prefer to keep it shaved. Had it longer as an adult for nearly the past 10 years because I felt like I needed to to be professional at work. Although I have gauges in my ears and that was ostensibly out of a desire to keep those covered. Shaved again over the summer (pandemic started and didn’t have to go in to the office as much) and I have no desire to ever go back. 

I remember being asked by a classmate pre- middle school if I was a girl or a boy - I hit them. I don’t remember giving them an answer. I think my hair was cut short, oversized T-shirt.

Often struggled to find clothing that I liked and felt comfortable in, changing outfits many times before leaving home. Sometimes giving up and staying home because I felt too uncomfortable/ anxious - on at least a couple of occasions missing out on times with friends. Felt so uncomfortable on some occasions that I cried. No trouble dressing myself since I realized I was nonbinary and started presenting masculine. Have not felt uncomfortable with my appearance since I started presenting masculine and binding my chest; I have struggled with social anxiety since at least highschool - I have had very little since I started presenting masculine.

Pre- middle school I would wear stretch pants and oversized t-shirts. was I uncomfortable with my body when puberty started?

I remember developing earlier than a lot of my classmates. I enjoyed beating the boys in arm wrestling.

I was the only girl on the wrestling team in middle school. Was only on the team briefly, don’t remember why I quit.

For at least the past year I have been watching YouTube videos about/from transmasculine people about their transitions.

NSFW content now, if you know me in real life, please do not read any further.

Have you stopped reading now? Thank you for respecting my boundaries. &lt;3

For years, when dressing/ undressing/ getting in or out of the shower I would press my chest flat or manipulate it to see what it would look like if I did not have breasts.

I told my mom it was okay to call me by my birth name and use the pronouns she felt most comfortable using for me. Fast forward to today.
I now have a girlfriend and my family is being more supportive than I thought they would be. Only when I told my grandma, my mom yelled at me for telling her that. Apparently she had a full mental breakdown when i thought i was trans and nobody's told her that I'm still not cis and I hate that she can't handle the thought of me being with a girl. Honestly I love being feminine but lately I've felt more masculine and part of me wants to start on t. I just know my mom has told me point blank she cannot live with me while I transition and I really want my dad's approval, which I would lose if I went on t.

Hey folks,
Just wondering if anyone has had a similar experience and could chat. 
When I started questioning my gender identity I identified as genderfluid. I went on testosterone because I had a lot of dysphoria with my chest and had to do HRT for a year before they’d give me a letter for top surgery. I feel like I tried to conform to ftm identity within the first five years after starting T, but the older I get it just still doesn’t feel right and I want to embrace my enby identity. I feel like I’m returning to my roots. I think I may have taken T too far. I miss being androgynous, but curling my eyelashes and chapstick are as far as I like to take make-up. I definitely am masc leaning. I want to be a pretty boy and now I just look rugged. Losing my hair is not helping. It was always a big part of my identity. I’m struggling finding a balance and words to describe what’s happening. If anyone has felt something similar and can just share some about their experience I think it would be comforting to me. 
Side note- when I first came out as trans I used they/them pronouns and it was really hard for people. It seemed it would be easier for others to use he/him and I was exited about presenting more masc so I switched. Now it just doesn’t feel right and I want to get back to they/them but I’m scared!

for a long time now i've been considering the possibility that i may be nonbinary. when i was younger, the idea that i was a girl wasn't really a concept i cared/thought about. fortunately ive never really experienced dysphoria, the closest ive had is being ***very*** uncomfortable with my chest every so often and with more feminine clothes (dresses, heels) sometimes. I would love to look into binders/top surgery in the future. im most familiar with she/her, i want to be called they/them more and more, and ive gotten really happy from being called he, dude, or man in public. my name is unisex, and i would hate being called anything more feminine or masculine. i want to be known as just me, but idk what that is yet.

i don't know if this is similar to what any other nb people have experienced or if it's just me being weird. i don't live in an accepting environment, so if anybody has advice for figuring myself out i would very much appreciate it! thank u so much for ur help",NonBinary,questioning gender,1613817079.0,"{'created_utc': 1613791879, 'id': 'lny5be', 'num_comments': 8, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""so, im afab and i really need some help.\n\nfor a long time now i've been considering the possibility that i may be nonbinary. when i was younger, the idea that i was a girl wasn't really a concept i cared/thought about. fortunately ive never really experienced dysphoria, the closest ive had is being ***very*** uncomfortable with my chest every so often and with more feminine clothes (dresses, heels) sometimes.

2021-02-20 06:11:38,lo0uz2,2,1,"I woke up to horrible dysphoria this morning, after a horror movie nightmare. Going back to sleep, I dreamt of being rejected by the beautiful women that I fetishized seemingly all my life. It ended seeing myself sat a park table, bearded and sad. Waking up, I felt a powerful lust for these women again. Lust that made me feel like a man again.

My friends (bless them) called me to play some games. “I know you like (game), why don’t we play that?” He said. It felt great playing with him, but I cut things off at 11 for my therapy call. Which turned out to start at 3, giving my friend enough time to fall asleep after his night shift. 

I sat for 4 hours stewing in myself, waiting to explain to my therapist why I had asked for an extra appointment this week. The truth was I was impatient, but I know that if you say “no, I can’t wait” that therapists will try to make extra time.

I’ve felt triggered by seeing people I know on YouTube announce their transition. It makes me doubt myself for sharing their interests. My therapist asked what I thought of them, and I said I pity them. 

To feel so uncomfortable, to be in so much pain that you feel compelled to... harm themselves. That’s how I’ve seen it. I haven’t really accepted transition as a means to anything, just a stopgap measure for someone who is unwell. 

These people ARE unwell. The ones I see are depressed, labored in their speech, going on and on about things they can’t possibly care about, like video games, movies, and so many other things that just don’t warrant the time needed to write, edit, and record hour-long videos. They are obsessed with... something, and they are undoubtedly avoiding it by focusing on art.

They conclude by saying “I’m opening up now, and it feels so good!” And go on the usual spiel about how they’ve only been open with a few people, but now a huge weight is off their shoulders. I don’t want to hear it, any of it. 

“So you feel they’re doing wrong by themselves.” My therapist interprets from my scattered mumbles. “Yes. No. I just don’t want to be like them.” 

“Do you feel superior to trans people?” She asks. I do. I truly, truly do. I’m going to have kids, I’m going to be conventionally attractive, I’m going to be accepted no matter what I do. 

“No” I lie. “Not anymore.” I try to correct. 

We go over a list of triggers she has been BEGGING me for weeks to offer, and we make plans to meet again and discuss exposure plans. 

I can barely eat for the rest of the day. I’ve cried into my moms arms and she begs me to exercise, go for a walk, eat, SOMETHING. I don’t want to. I want to call my ex girlfriend and apologize for dumping her in as cruel a way as possible. 

I know that I did so because I was ashamed of feelings, and was tired of her not being able to make me feel better. Accepting my feelings now is no excuse to intrude on her life without me. She said “my love for you is unconditional” and “if you leave I’ll never love anyone again” and bull fucking shit. She was wrong then I’m terrified to call and find she’s come to her senses, and just tell me “Yeah, good for you, do what you’re avoiding doing by calling me”. 

To imagine her rejection crumples me up like paper, and I agree to get dressed and go for a walk with my mom.

We walk past a little old lady, and I envy her small frame. It takes reaching the end of our housing block and walking on the side of the main road before I agree to eat some food we can buy at the supermarket. Chicken wraps. 

I cry some more hugging my mom, begging to hear about times I’ve been a good person. She tells me to take a shower to give her time to think. As the water heaps upon me, I pray, really PRAY to God and Jesus. It’s not an old habit, so I mix in some allah just in case. 

Rather than see my friends as people dealing with my bullshit, I thank my God for their company, for their patience. I thank him for making me, so that I might live. Out of the shower, I read a devotional about forgiving myself, meant to hype me up for un upcoming bible verse, and I read it out loud. Corinthians 1:3-7, and onward until my app doesn’t offer me anymore to read.

I turn over my womanhood, worn smooth like a stone turned over and over in worried hands. Manhood seems to be expected. I am on T, I take the traditional medical path of a trans man. But it feels like I'm lying. I'm more than a man, I'm also a woman. \n\nI don't actively identify as nonbinary personally, and many gender labels don't fit. My gender slips through my fingers like sane. It sits heavy on my tongue. I'm trans. Or am I? I feel adrift at sea. I am happy with my medical transition, I love my name, I love my dual pronouns. My gender escapes me. A concept so deep and wide I get lost in it. Womanhood is everything manhood isn't; manhood is everything womanhood isn't. What are they? I don't know but I somehow find comfort in them both. \n\nSchrodingers transgender."", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Schrodingers Transgender', 'created': 1613837955.0}"

Most people don’t understand being non-binary and may not ever get it. That has nothing to do with me and doesn’t change my validity or my gender. I don’t put up with disrespect but I also don’t have to make everyone agree with me and understand me to be valid. My validity does not come from others’ opinions and views. It comes from inside me. 

I am not here to prove the validity of non-binary genders. I am not here to force my gender into others. Just like the meme that is the comment or tweet about how whether a person understands the Korean language or not does not change the fact that it exists, whether someone understands or accepts my gender does not change the fact that I am non-binary. 

This is the realization I came to a little over a year ago. With it I have been able to accept the many aspects of myself that emphasize my AGAB. I’m AMAB and I look really good with a beard. But in the past it has been a source of huge dysphoria. Now I can have a beard and not deal with the dysphoria. I can do and wear and present however I want, even if it comes off as male, and be just fine because I am still non-binary and whatever anyone else thinks does not change that. 

This being said, I still will have the thoughts and feel the pressure to present in a way that feels more androgynous or femme to combat my AGAB. I still will feel dysphoria over things of my AGAB- including my top two sources, which are wearing a suit and tie and having a beard. But I am able to work through these feelings and thoughts better by reminding myself of these ideas

These ideas aren’t magically there and I’m now good all the time. They are a constant thing to remind myself. It’s like doing the dishes, you don’t just reach a point where they are done and you don’t ever have to do them again. It’s a constant thing. Maybe one day in the future when all this gender stuff is no longer a thing and people can just be who they are and not have it tied to a gender system then it may be done with but we are far from that. So I just keep reminding myself of these thoughts. 

My identity is valid and it has nothing to do with the views of others. I don’t have to fit myself into the oppressive gender binary system that is out there to be valid. I am simply me and that is enough.

another question is it okay if someone refer to themselves as only non binary without any other label (like demigirl, agender etc) as if it's a gender itself? or is nonbinary a gender itself and I can't use it for myself? I'm really confused

2021-02-20 23:18:17,loje4y,5,2,"Hey all,

I'm new to this subreddit and I really love the positivity here (I'm also new to Reddit in general).

So for a long while, I've known that I didn't identify as a cisgender woman. I've been dating my (now) fiance for 6 years going on 7, and we started dating in high school before I really had any queer friends. 

Since I've gone to college and come back, we not live together. I see myself as more of a liberal, open person, and he's kind of more of the angry gamer sort of person if you feel me. I love him dearly and I couldn't imagine my life without him, and I know he loves me very very much.

For the most part everything is fine, but when it comes to me expressing my gender, he gets kind of ""anti-sjw"" about it. I think it's some internalized transphobia. He just always seems to make a joke out of the gender spectrum and I can't seem to explain it in any way that makes sense to him. 

I know for a fact that if I ever wanted to pursue physical changes like top surgery or T, I would lose him.

I'm just stressing a lot because we're getting married in October and I just want to know I have his full support, not just most of it, for our lives together. 

Do any of y'all have any success stories with explaining nb and trans issues in general to someone who initally didn't get it or want to understand? Any support would be extremely helpful &lt;3

2021-02-21 06:19:50,loqqmm,0,1,"I woke up from a dream feeling like maybe I could be happy. I tried to tell my mom how I was just denying myself, but I had to go back to my bedroom, maybe my old room, to get my lamotrigine and my Zoloft.

Lamotrigine goes down anyway you want, but Zoloft wants a pillow to land on, food in the stomach. My mom brought me breakfast in bed, her bed, and asked me to eat the pancakes. They’re somewhere between crepes and flapjacks, soaked in maple and butter. They’re probably better than any breakfast I can buy, certainly now.

She cuts one bite for herself, then one for me, seeing me barely able to look at the most lovingly prepared breakfast in the world. We take turns, her feeling like she’s eating what’s meant for me, me feeling compelled by basic courtesy and the knowledge that I will decline even further if I don’t raise my blood sugar. I’m ready for the pill split in half two rooms away. She doesn’t know about it, and grabs the bottle to split another. Doesn’t matter. Just like the food. Swallow.

At some point, I finish my devotional to Jesus. Psalms 23:1-6 and Matthew 6:25-27. It feels REAL, it feels RIGHT. I’m almost glad that I can’t remember the exact words and had to reread that the lord prepares me a table for me before my enemies, anoints my head with oil, and asks if my worries will add a single day to my life. 

Making google searches for churches with trans acceptance isn’t hard, they’re desperate for butts in zoom calls, but I’m forced to pause when I remember my very first act of religious devotion: calling people at an anti abortion rally at my school fascists for five hours before COVID. 

Threats against LGBTQ churches will be investigated as hate crimes, so people keep their mouthes shut about that, but they have no trouble plastering up pictures of fetuses in sinks and talking about “in Japan you have to marry a Japanese...” when they think no one is listening. 

I’m torn up about not letting go of my old self and embracing Christ completely. I haven’t had any fight in me since that angry day, and if there were a clergy member who could speak just the right words, I’d be ready to grab some their picket signs and make some pro-life molotovs for planned parenthood. Progress stalls as I see the consensus between every church for a hundred miles that my mother murdered my siblings. 

Morning is over, and so is my mom’s patience for my treating her house like a padded room. **REDACTED** wild life area is her agenda for me; go take some pictures, get some fresh air, just come honey, I’ll drive. We can’t. We’re getting new internet installed, and it’s of the utmost importance we supervise the process. “Between 12 and 4?! We’d like to reschedule, thank you. Thursday?” Fine, we’re already used to it being slow. Clean my body, and wait for her to pull out of the garage; I’m too big to fit into the passenger side otherwise.

Just getting out of **REDACTED** and driving **REDACTED** down the highway instead of our usual route we take feels amazing. We get to our exit, and after a few miles of orchards? Farms? We get to the end of the pavement: Levee road, starting at a yellow gate that could stop the car, but it’s open. Good! We can keep going. 

A sign proclaims NO MOTOR VEHICLES ON LEVEE. We should be fine, if we weren’t supposed to be here, wouldn’t the gate be closed? Another sign reiterates the point, then another. We drive a little further up a hill THIS IS A LEVEE! THIS IS A LEVEE! HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT!? DON’T YOU REMEMBER KATRINA?! THE LED ZEPPLIN SONG?! GO BACK!

We laugh at ourselves and the sheep dog chasing our car on the other side of the fence, and it feels amazing. We reorient the GPS to a bend in the river closer to the road, and stop to take some pictures. I get some messages on discord, thinking “man, I’m not going to play any games today and it’s fine”. 

The cable guy calls, never getting the call from dispatch to not come to our house, and happy that he might get to eat a cheeseburger while waiting for us. “I’m pretty satisfied with these pictures, we can go back.” Going back home I feel fine, I join my friends playing games, and I feel fine. He says he needs to disconnect my internet for a while and

Oh god

Oh god

I could barely stand still in my house, I couldn’t let myself cry in front of the cable guy because like, dude, come on. I wait in agony for his little box to say “I’m internet now” as he goes back and forth between positions obviously meant for two people and not one guy slapping on slippers every time he walks in the door. 

It takes forever, and when he’s gone, my blood sugar is down and my body is messed up. But I’m not hungry. I choke down the taco so I can go on a walk. My body goes from feeling wrong to right as my mom holds my arm and tells me I’m going through hell. It makes me feel manly to think about it that way. I like it.

Back home, I choke down some antihistamine and start writing this journal.

I’m almost glad that I can’t remember the exact words and had to reread that the lord prepares me a table for me before my enemies, anoints my head with oil, and asks if my worries will add a single day to my life. \n\nMaking google searches for churches with trans acceptance isn’t hard, they’re desperate for butts in zoom calls, but I’m forced to pause when I remember my very first act of religious devotion: calling people at an anti abortion rally at my school fascists for five hours before COVID. \n\nThreats against LGBTQ churches will be investigated as hate crimes, so people keep their mouthes shut about that, but they have no trouble plastering up pictures of fetuses in sinks and talking about “in Japan you have to marry a Japanese...” when they think no one is listening. \n\nI’m torn up about not letting go of my old self and embracing Christ completely. I haven’t had any fight in me since that angry day, and if there were a clergy member who could speak just the right words, I’d be ready to grab some their picket signs and make some pro-life molotovs for planned parenthood. Progress stalls as I see the consensus between every church for a hundred miles that my mother murdered my siblings. \n\nMorning is over, and so is my mom’s patience for my treating her house like a padded room. **REDACTED** wild life area is her agenda for me; go take some pictures, get some fresh air, just come honey, I’ll drive. We can’t. We’re getting new internet installed, and it’s of the utmost importance we supervise the process. “Between 12 and 4?! We’d like to reschedule, thank you. Thursday?” Fine, we’re already used to it being slow. Clean my body, and wait for her to pull out of the garage; I’m too big to fit into the passenger side otherwise.\n\nJust getting out of **REDACTED** and driving **REDACTED** down the highway instead of our usual route we take feels amazing. We get to our exit, and after a few miles of orchards? Farms? We get to the end of the pavement: Levee road, starting at a yellow gate that could stop the car, but it’s open. Good! We can keep going. \n\nA sign proclaims NO MOTOR VEHICLES ON LEVEE. We should be fine, if we weren’t supposed to be here, wouldn’t the gate be closed? Another sign reiterates the point, then another. We drive a little further up a hill THIS IS A LEVEE! THIS IS A LEVEE! HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT!? DON’T YOU REMEMBER KATRINA?! THE LED ZEPPLIN SONG?! GO BACK!\n\nWe laugh at ourselves and the sheep dog chasing our car on the other side of the fence, and it feels amazing. We reorient the GPS to a bend in the river closer to the road, and stop to take some pictures. I get some messages on discord, thinking “man, I’m not going to play any games today and it’s fine”. \n\nThe cable guy calls, never getting the call from dispatch to not come to our house, and happy that he might get to eat a cheeseburger while waiting for us. “I’m pretty satisfied with these pictures, we can go back.” Going back home I feel fine, I join my friends playing games, and I feel fine. He says he needs to disconnect my internet for a while and\n\nOh god\n\nOh god\n\nI could barely stand still in my house, I couldn’t let myself cry in front of the cable guy because like, dude, come on. I wait in agony for his little box to say “I’m internet now” as he goes back and forth between positions obviously meant for two people and not one guy slapping on slippers every time he walks in the door. \n\nIt takes forever, and when he’s gone, my blood sugar is down and my body is messed up. But I’m not hungry. I choke down the taco so I can go on a walk. My body goes from feeling wrong to right as my mom holds my arm and tells me I’m going through hell. It makes me feel manly to think about it that way. I like it.\n\nBack home, I choke down some antihistamine and start writing this journal. I feel better now than when I started.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Real time diary: out of the house, into the egg?', 'created': 1613913590.0}"

Atm  I'm not really sure about my gender identity at all. I just know, that I  never felt comfortable as a woman (I'm afab) but I don't think I'd feel  comfortable describing myself as a man. I think right now nonbinary is  what really feels best to me. I'm just not sure about how to talk to my  family, my flat mates and my friends. My friends would probably be the  most accepting and would probably even try to accommodate me when I  wouldn't even ask for it. My flat mates and my parents on the other hand  probably won't. I feel like the existence of nonbinary people is still  something new to them :(

Another  thing I'm thinking about is my pronouns. I'm super happy with they/them  in English, but I live in Germany. We don't have a good, widespread  equivalent to they/them. Only it and that sounds extremely  condescending. I'm kind of scared of neo pronouns. Partly because I  didn't really get warm with any of them, partly because I don't think  anyone who isn't extremely into gender issues would understand it or use  them (properly).

If any of you  guys have any experiences, especially in German speaking places, please  let me know. I guess, I don't really know what I wanted to do with this  post.

Hello! I thought this may fit in here considering I’m a super queer nonbinary individual, seeking a hair style that represents that.

Until I finally realised my body belonged to me, I had long hair all my life. I took the liberty of getting it buzz cut two years ago and I’ve had that style ever sense. Absolutely love it. But when I had long hair, it was dead, matted, greasy and overall lifeless. It’s not that I didn’t take care of it- it just existed that way.

So I’ve got about half an inch of hair on my head and I want something like a pixie cut super bad. I’m just not sure if that’s even achievable considering my hairs “history” if that even makes sense 😂

Here’s a picture of what I want-

I have always been rather androgynous but identified as a cis het man. There have been times where I have been identified by strangers as a woman, when I was younger and thinner I was much more androgynous, and have dealt with a lot of harassment by cis het men, slurs, threats etc. Last summer I started dating a NB AFAB person. I was immediately confronted with the fact that since I was not dating a woman that I was not in a straight relationship. I discussed this with my, now former, partner a lot. They present rather feminine, but when I met them years ago, they didn’t and I was just as attracted to them. But in general I am attracted to femininity. My NB partner asked me once “if I had a penis would you still want to be with me?” And at the time I couldn’t say. This didn’t make them very happy, so I spent a lot of energy confronting this, and this is basically where I’ve landed. 

I am sometimes attracted to cis women. I am sometimes attracted to trans women. I am sometimes attracted to NB AFAB and NB AMAB people. I am never attracted to men, cis or trans. And the sexual trauma I have dealt with because of cis men makes my attraction to NB AMAB and trans women uncomfy because I was forced to interact with penises extensively as a child. I do not see trans women or NB AMAB people as men and I hate feeling like I am reducing people to what their genitals look like but I can’t really get over not wanting to interact with someone’s “penis” even if it belongs to a woman or NB AMAB person. 

I also have begun to feel uncomfortable being identified as a man. I know I’d definitely like a safe space to express greater femininity in a sexual context. I think I’d very much like to have beautiful pink fingernails in a public context. I have very long hair and wearing it in braids makes me feel cute. I’m also generally happy with my gender presentation though I am experimenting more and I know when people look at me now, they see a cis man. I also find it very difficult to relate to cis men and in the past few years find myself drawn socially and otherwise to more and more NB people. My ex told me that they suspect I am somewhere on the trans spectrum and I’m inclined to agree. But I find myself asking “Am I trans? Am I trans enough? Am I queer? Am I queer enough?”

I honestly don't mind for pronouns, personally speaking, although whenever someone has used the ""incorrect"" pronoun on me I've felt something to what I think is gender euphoria. 

I don't know how to correctly express myself on these matters because I am new in the self-discovery journey myself, so I hope I don't offend anyone. 

I have the body of what is traditionally considered a man. But I've always been called a ""sus"" because through out all my life I would do certain mannerism that were not expected to be seen from a man. Many people called me gay. Even though I was not. But now in the present time, I've come to realize that most of my crushes gravitate towards people that behave/seem androgynously. This has lead me to most times fall for lesbians. 

I remember a specific time in which I met this one girl that was gay, but we did not know at the time. When I would be near her she would make me feel what I thought at the time was to feel like a woman. I really enjoyed the fact that when I was in her company I felt like I could just let go and ""act"" as girly as I wanted. 

Now the reason why I am posting here is because from just looks I am actually a 6'4'' person, and to top it of Ive been told I have an intimidating presences ( when in fact if people knew me they would say other wise.) 

My issues lie on the fact that I do consider myself not just a ""man"" there is definitely a mix of feelings when it comes to how I perceive myself. But because of my physical traits there is a huge load of expectations placed on me by outsiders and if I am to cross one of them I am seen as weird. (this has been my experience) one time a person told me to man up, that because of how big I am I should not be acting x way. 

My question is: have anyone out there experience something similar to this? I've been socialized as a cis man all my life and I believe that because of this linear way of being which is not how I really wanted to live life like, Ive developed certain anxieties. Like stress eating.

My sibling (they/them) recently told me they are getting top surgery. I'm happy they told me, but I also worry about their getting surgery now, while covid is still a significant concern. They do have other medical conditions that could exacerbate a covid infection. 

I'm a cis man, and while I am not questioning their choice, I worry that expressing concern will make them uncomfortable. This is the kind of thing I would normally not think twice talking to them about, but I feel like they're putting distance between us lately. They have not told me they're nb; I found out about a month ago from a friend who follows them on social media. Because they are not being open with our family, I don't feel like I have anyone to talk to.

I'm hoping the good people of r/nonbinary can offer guidance on how to communicate with them. I feel like I am the only person in their life that would both readily accept their choice, and also express concern about their safety.

2021-02-22 21:05:12,lpzvrt,2,1,"Summary: a new student at my school, who I have two classes with, does not use the pronouns typical to the gender binary.

Most of my day today was pretty uneventful––until I got to my second-to-last class. I noticed someone there who hadn't been there before, and sure enough, my teacher introduced this kid to the class. You know, the usual ""Class, this is \[Name\]"" spiel. Anyway, I start paying less attention to the class and more to the new kid. And lemme tell you. This kid gave off so many ""F\*ck your gender binary, I let my subscription to it end for a reason"" and just gay vibes that I think said vibes were visible in outer space. 

After that class was my (thankfully) last class of the day. This is the other class that I have with this person. I walk into class a bit late as I had stayed behind after my previous class to talk with that teacher. I sit down at my seat, and the next thing I hear is ""Hi, I'm \[Name\], or \[Nickname\]. I use they/them pronouns."" So I'm just sitting there, (I'm seated at a desk behind my best friend's spot, which I am slightly envious of as my friend gets an entire table.) pretty shocked, and also admiring the *hell* out of this wonderful person who is able to just get up and announce their pronouns like that. 

In my third good idea of the year (I typically have about 5 per year. Rough estimate, however), I had decided to wear the non-binary ring my friend made me. I don't think they noticed it, but to me it was a stroke of luck.

I got to talk to them at the end of class, but I had to keep it short and sweet as I needed to leave. I didn't want to push them out of their comfort zone so I just said something along the lines of ""It was great to meet you."" I don't remember if I said anything else. If so, it wasn't that important. Yes, this happened today, and yes, I have both faulty short-term memory and faulty long-term memory.

&amp;#x200B;

Just wanted to share on here. I hope it's appropriate to post this here and just post this in general. I did not ask if I could mention them in a post, however I feel that I have done the best I can to create a post that does not give any specifics or details that could be used to identify this person. I left out names, nicknames, class names, etc.

I'm just super happy to find another person who doesn't use normal pronouns\*! :D

I noticed someone there who hadn\'t been there before, and sure enough, my teacher introduced this kid to the class. You know, the usual ""Class, this is \\[Name\\]"" spiel. Anyway, I start paying less attention to the class and more to the new kid. And lemme tell you. This kid gave off so many ""F\\*ck your gender binary, I let my subscription to it end for a reason"" and just gay vibes that I think said vibes were visible in outer space. \n\nAfter that class was my (thankfully) last class of the day. This is the other class that I have with this person. I walk into class a bit late as I had stayed behind after my previous class to talk with that teacher. I sit down at my seat, and the next thing I hear is ""Hi, I\'m \\[Name\\], or \\[Nickname\\]. I use they/them pronouns."" So I\'m just sitting there, (I\'m seated at a desk behind my best friend\'s spot, which I am slightly envious of as my friend gets an entire table.) pretty shocked, and also admiring the *hell* out of this wonderful person who is able to just get up and announce their pronouns like that. \n\nIn my third good idea of the year (I typically have about 5 per year. Rough estimate, however), I had decided to wear the non-binary ring my friend made me. I don\'t think they noticed it, but to me it was a stroke of luck.\n\nI got to talk to them at the end of class, but I had to keep it short and sweet as I needed to leave. I didn\'t want to push them out of their comfort zone so I just said something along the lines of ""It was great to meet you."" I don\'t remember if I said anything else. If so, it wasn\'t that important. Yes, this happened today, and yes, I have both faulty short-term memory and faulty long-term memory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust wanted to share on here. I hope it\'s appropriate to post this here and just post this in general. I did not ask if I could mention them in a post, however I feel that I have done the best I can to create a post that does not give any specifics or details that could be used to identify this person. I left out names, nicknames, class names, etc.\n\nI\'m just super happy to find another person who doesn\'t use normal pronouns\\*! :D \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*I\'m certainly one to talk about normal pronouns.

something that i held onto throughout this experience was that i get these moments of clarity sometimes where i feel like a girl again. it makes me feel so happy and excited. however, my dumbass ocd brain has me convinced that i only feel happy/euphoric because being cis is the norm so i’m relieved to feel female because it’s easier in society and it isn’t what truly makes me happy.

I've moved out and I'm at university now. As such I'm trying to define myself. I grew up in an all-girls catholic school, sooo sex and gender ed wasn't really a thing other than ""don't do it until you get married""

I've since found myself to be asexual, I've never felt romantically or sexually attracted to anyone. But I'm still questioning myself gender-wise. I don't think I'm trans; I'm ok with she/her pronouns. I've always used the female bathrooms. I don't wear makeup because I don't like how it feels and  I tend to wear plain clothing, trousers, t-shirts, that kinda thing. I don't like wearing skirts or dresses. The big thing is that I don't like my body particularly; I have fairly big boobs, and I don't like that they get in the way.

2021-02-23 06:12:47,lqb3or,6,3,"Howdy y'all. I'm cis, and my partner recently came out to me as nonbinary. It wasn't entirely unexpected or anything, as they had been touch-n'-go questioning their gender for a bit, and I've had sneaking suspicions since pretty early on in our relationship. As long as they're comfortable with themselves, I'm happy for them. 

Anywho, I'm just looking for advice on how I can be there for them when they're dealing with dysphoria. It really makes me upset to hear how uncomfortable they are in their own skin from time to time. I tried some of the same stuff that helped when they realized they were bisexual (we've been there for one another through a lot of self realizations), some of it has helped and some of it hasn't. 

If it helps any, they were AMAB, are currently most comfortable with they/them and I'm their first partner. Like I said, I'm cis, and I'm also demisexual. My partner is really sweet, and I want to do as much as I can to help them be comfortable. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

Also, I know my partner frequents this community, so buddy if you see this I love you and you're beautiful.

2021-02-23 08:00:11,lqcx7b,0,2,"So I’ve been antagonizing over this for a while. My problem is that I have always had really bad body image issues and it’s making anything regarding trans identity hard to explore. The same goes for my depression, I am apathetic 99% of the time, so how do I tell if I’m actually upset or distressed by my sex assigned at birth? 

Lately, my largest point of contention is with my chest, (I’m afab, but I identify as agender). I really want top surgery and feel like I’d be a lot more happy and confident if I had a flat chest, but at the same time, the most ill experience is discomfort when I see my chest. I was a lot more comfortable about my chest before I’d realized I was trans because I’d internalized femininity so badly I thought I had to be happy about it. When I research dysphoria, it’s always portrayed as someone feeling constantly uncomfortable and depressed about their gender assigned at birth. I feel like I don’t fit this category as I have no problem being called any pronoun and only feel uncomfortable with my chest when I realize it’s there or look in a mirror. I wish I was flat but I don’t hate my chest either. At most I’d say I mildly dislike it. 

I also think I might have dysphoria about periods, probably more so than with my chest. I remember the first time id gotten my period I had cried and either I’d gotten uterus cancer so I could just remove it. I don’t feel like I have any particular reason for this, though I do have pcos so that could be a contributing factor given how painful and irregular periods are really common with it. 

I feel like saying I have gender dysphoria or bringing it up with my therapist isn’t going to work out and kinda detracts from the experiences of people with actual and extreme dysphoria. I also feel like I might be searching for reasons that I might have dysphoria to get top surgery criteria wise, but wouldn’t that be a pretty good reason to think I do have dysphoria if I want top surgery that bad? It is also an extreme possibility I have body dysmorphia about my weight since it has been a constant and pervasive factor in my life since I was 10.

I just had an anxiety attack over it, I was messaging my friend at that time and she referred to my chest as 'boobs' which, although obviously she didn't mean it, made it much worse because that's the dreaded word that makes my dysphoria worse.

It doesn't help that I was reading a comment section FULL of transphobes earlier today, I know that I should stay away from them comment sections because it makes me feel a lot worse and so angry. They're so ignorant, and they don't understand the harm they cause to a lot of trans and nonbinary people. It's really sad that transphobia seems to be accepted as 'logic' to a lot of people, judging by the comment sections, most people.

I just hope one day I can have top surgery and I reach a point where I have more gender euphoria than dysphoria, and that I learn to keep away from transphobes.

I did measure but I don't trust myself to do things correctly.\n\nI just had an anxiety attack over it, I was messaging my friend at that time and she referred to my chest as 'boobs' which, although obviously she didn't mean it, made it much worse because that's the dreaded word that makes my dysphoria worse.\n\nIt doesn't help that I was reading a comment section FULL of transphobes earlier today, I know that I should stay away from them comment sections because it makes me feel a lot worse and so angry. They're so ignorant, and they don't understand the harm they cause to a lot of trans and nonbinary people. It's really sad that transphobia seems to be accepted as 'logic' to a lot of people, judging by the comment sections, most people.\n\nI just hope one day I can have top surgery and I reach a point where I have more gender euphoria than dysphoria, and that I learn to keep away from transphobes. I know now their 'opinions' will never change. I still live with my mum who is far from accepting, maybe when I move out I can be more myself."", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Just had anxiety attack because of dysphoria ://', 'created': 1614107309.0}"

**Top surgery**

_Double Incision_ : probably what you imagine top surgery to be. Two scars under the breasts extending to your armpits.
Both scars meet in the middle for very big breasts.
Most breast tissue is removed and the surgeon creates a masculine shape. 

[top surgery experience [sfw] ](https://youtu.be/LbraIM0bSc0)

[surgery video (warning VERY graphic)](https://youtu.be/9GFYPcmPqFA)

_T-anchor/inverted T anchor_ : a type of DI surgery which leaves the nipple stalk intakt in most cases. It leaves a slightly bigger scar. It is criticised by some surgeons, so do your own research and wager the pros and cons. 

_Periareolar (short, Peri)_ : only available for very small chest sizes. A and B cups.
Only possible if you have your nipples are small and at an angle of 90° or higher.
Only possible if you have very good skin elasticity.
The incision is done around the nipple. 
Leaves almost no visible scar and scars can fade completely.

[explanation of the surgery [sfw] ](https://youtu.be/EKs9f2pWejo)

[surgery experience vlog [sfw] ](https://youtu.be/1Su0CbtprcI)

_Keyhole_ : very similar to peri and often mixxed up. Even less scars. Only one small incision under the nipple is used.
Same requirements as for Peri and very similar results.

[surgery video [graphic] ](https://youtu.be/4b_0GwA0d_Y)

[explanation [sfw] ](https://youtu.be/32XnuAK9WDQ)

_Fishmouth_ : mostly used for non-binary patients.
Leaves 2 visible scars across your chest, some people like that. Leaves the nipple stalk in takt, which DI does not.

Didn't find a surgery video since it's a rare one. 

[explanation [sfw] ](https://youtu.be/vu_iYjdfXpg)

**bottom surgery**

For all bottom surgeries you can leave your original parts in takt or bury them under the new genitalia.
There are two types Metoidioplasty (Meta) and Phalloplasty (phallo). You have to be on T for a while for both of those. Some surgeon say 1 year, some 2. In some countries you need a psychologist to write you a letter allowing you to pursue bottom surgery, in America you don't need that. 

You can choose to have balls or not in both surgeries.
You can choose to keep your original urethra or lengthen it into the new genitals.
You can have meta first and Phallo later.

**Metoidioplasty**

Your enlarged glitoris will be formed into a mirco penis. 
You will have all cis dick qualities exept producing sperm. 
You can get hard on your own through being aroused. 
Lengh depends on your size, but simple release (cutting the part that holds your clitoris down) can get you an extra inch. 

r/metoidioplasty is a good resource 

[surgery video [very graphic, watch at your own risk] ](https://youtu.be/ZGCscj8RXZs)

[healed results [nsfw, it's a collection of dicks] ](https://cranects.com/metoidioplasty-photos/)

**phalloplasty**

r/phalloplasty is really amazing 

The creation of a phallus (dick) out of skin taken from elsewhere on your body. Will leave a relatively big scar. 
This one has several types that all give you very different looking results.
Plus different options to customise your dick depending on how many surgeries you want/can afford.
You can't get hard on your own, but you can use different kinds of erectile devices. 
Medical tattooing is also an option here, but I will talk about this more later on.

[good pictures for many procedures [nsfw] ](https://cranects.com/ftm-phalloplasty/)

[all the pics you'll ever need [nsfw] ](https://www.gurecon.com/photos)

_radial forearm flap phalloplasty (RFF)_ : takes your arm as a donor site.
Has full erotic and tactile sensation in most cases.
Girth and lengh depends on your arm size and how much fat you have there.
Your arm scar will be numb forever because the nerve is taken out of your arm and used in your penis to give you sensation.
The ability to use your arm/hand won't be impacted at all and the scar can be tattooed over in some cases.

_Abdominal phallo_ : takes your public area as your donor site.
Skin isn't separated, only flapped over to form your phallus.
Less sensation then with RFF, but also less scarring.

_MLD phallo_ : takes your back as a donor site. Best looking dicks in my opinion, but also the least sensation because no nerves are connected.
The scar fades a lot and is the least visible one.

_Alt (alterolateral) phalloplasty_ : second most common phalloplasty. Takes your legs as a donor site.
A lot of sensation, but generally gives you a more girth dick.

_Glansplasty_ : can be performed on every kind of phallo. It's the formation of glands (the tip of your dick).

**other surgeries**

_facial masculinasation surgery_ : some guys don't get good results from T. FMS can give you a more masculine face shape.

_Body masculinization surgery_ : exactly what the name says. A series of procedures that can make you look more masculine.
This includes hip and butt liposuction.

_Medical tattooing_ : your phallo dick can be tattooed to maje it look like it has veins and is a more cis colour. Those are extremely realistic.

**please rember that surgery experiences and results vary from person to person and one guys results might not be your results.
This includes sensitivity, how much scars fade and if you will be able to cover them with tatoos plus lots more.
Ask your surgeon about any risks and do your own research aswell!**",NonBinary,I feel like there is tons of misinformation about ftm/ftn surgeries out there.

So I really need help and see what you guys think (I know no one can tell my gender for me but I really need to know which one describes me best as I dont want to incorrectly label myself).

So I as of right now I feel genderless.
I don't feel male nor female.
I also don't exactly feel non-binary but I feel like that actually describes me best out of all the genders I know of and I have a stronger connection to being non-binary than being male or female(if that makes sense).

But I don't feel offended if someone called me a girl or a boy.

I'm a 15 year old AFAB. I identify as a demigirl or non-binary woman and i'm an ace lesbian. For the most part I label myself as a non-binary ace lesbian, using non-binary as an umbrella term for my identity. 

I always end up doubting myself and it sucks. I hate it and I just want to be happy with the labels I choose. I am happy. I am. I just am scared that people in the community are going to tell me, I don't count. Which is stupid! I know! But I'll explain why. 

I use they/them pronouns and have been for a couple months now. Well I used to use she/they, then they/she and now just they/them. I don't mind she/her though and I still use it with extended family. I don't feel like explaining they/them pronouns and I'm not sure if I'll stick with it for forever or go back to she/they/they/she for convenience. 

I call myself a girl, a woman and I actually prefer female terms over masculine or neutral. I don't experience gender dysphoria and I'm okay with stereotypical female things and I pass as cis and don't correct people or say ""well actually i'm non-binary."" I don't feel the need, because I feel like if I said I was non-binary I'd make things more confusing if I said ""oh you can call me a girl, or I like female terms."" 

I know it's all about preference. I know there's so many non-binary people who are comfortable being called a girl/woman or a boy/man. I know non-binary people use gendered pronouns. 

I just feel like I don't fit in...or more so I'm afraid of taking someone's spot. I don't understand the struggle of dysphoria, I don't understand the struggle of having to say ""Actually I'm-"" 

I'm fine being perceived as a girl/woman. I'm fine with everyone thinking I'm a cis girl. It's whatever, because I know that I don't feel like a full female. 

I just feel like me...and even though I love the label. I like demigirl, non-binary woman and just non-binary. I'm just scared I still don't count. It's all very new to me. I have been identifying as a cis girl for fifteen years and now I'm just realizing. I don't feel like I completely fit that identity. 

Yes I call myself a girl. Yes I'm okay with being called a girl. Yes I actually love and prefer female terms. 

But I feel disconnected from femininity. I don't feel like that's me. I don't want to be in that box of just female. I feel trapped there...I just want to express and call myself whatever I want. 

Saying all this makes me scared I just sound like a cis girl trying to be ""cool &amp; quirky."" Maybe I am just trying to be cool and stick out? I genuinely don't know! Everything feels so confusing and scary. I don't want to offend people, I don't want to be alienated and I don't want to be just female. 

I'm really lost and scared that I'm not allowed to be non-binary. Would me identifying as non-binary hurt you guys? Would I mess up the meaning of non-binary?

TLDR: AMAB feverishly desires to be more of a woman inside, but not entirely a woman outside. Assuming to be NB for now. Wants to start HRT but Is afraid of forming boobies and losing “I workout sometimes” physique. 

Long story short, femme man discovers he’s bi, then realizes he’s never really liked what it means to be a man anyways, and the more “comfortable with his masculinity” he became, the more he was rejecting his masculinity. 

I don’t feel at home as a man. My issues of dysphoria mostly stem from social prescriptions and how my current hormones affect me, rather than a repulsion at my own body. (Though, my body hair and square frame are pretty uncool). 

I feel uncomfortable with being looked at, then expected to be, a man. Or worse, someone is afraid of or apprehensive in my presence because of the stigma surrounding my masculinity. 

I hate that my man brain makes me feel so much of what testosterone brings. From my temper to my sex drive, I never really felt like i should feel the ways that I do. It never felt like “me”. As if I was being controlled by these micro-harbingers of masculinity. 

But... I don’t think I’m a full fledged woman? I don’t want breasts. I like my penis, it’s pretty nice. I *would* be down for some degree of FFS, but I believe that stems from some vapid, repressed clinging to conventional beauty standards. I like my “manly” facial features, but not the ugly ones. 

^Which ^happen ^to ^be ^the ^manly ^parts, ^I ^guess. 

Anyways, I want to start taking HRT, but I’m slightly afraid of the effects of it. I want to blur the lines between my masc/fem sides, and definitely want to have a “mentality” and sex drive more akin to that of a woman. 

I guess I’ll stop beating around the Bush, I don’t want to grow titties. I work out, I like being strong and toned, and I do like my “masculine” flat, (semi)toned pecs. I want the softer skin, the restored hairline, the fuller hips and legs. But I don’t want to lose my strength and definition. 

Is breast growth avoidable? If I continue to work out could I counteract the effects of HRT causing breast growth?

Tw: dysphoria

I'm afab NB and got my first binder (that fit well!) a couple of weeks ago. I got such a rush of euphoria when I first put it on and that part was great! Then my feelings quickly turned to shame and frustration.

Suddenly my hips were too big and my body looked too soft and nothing looked right even though I was so happy to be binding. I felt like a clown and every time I wear the binder I get more and more upset because I like the way it feels, but then a few hours later I can't breathe super well (I take it off at this point) or I see the bumps that are still visible and feel stupid for trying.

I didn't think I could feel worse than I did before but wearing a binder makes it so obvious to me how weird I feel in my skin and I hate it. I wish I could go back to not knowing.

What's weird is that when I see you all in binders you look so good! I don't feel this way about anyone but myself.

My aunt and I don't exactly have the best relationship. We never talk, text, or see each other unless it's family get togethers (pre-covid) and I make it a point not to talk with her alone as much as I can. She's a cis lesbian, a Boomer/Gen-X cuspie, and she's not always been supportive of my trans girlfriend (now wife) due to some weird TERF-like views. Like she says the toilet in her bedroom can only be used by ""girls"" but wouldn't let my then-gf use it even after she came out as a trans woman. 


I can tell she wants to connect on the ""liking girls"" level. She was the one who made the first strides in my family to make my grandparents more accepting, and because of that I was able to bring home my first girlfriend to meet them when I was 16. She was very supportive then, and tried connecting by objectifying famous women with me, like ""isn't Scarlett Johansson so hot?"" and talking to me about how her own love life was going. 


But since I came out as genderqueer and asked to stop being called [DEAD-NAME] or go by any words that are associated with my AGAB, she doesn't even try to approach me or talk with me. Or like, she actively avoids talking to me when we're on family zoom calls. Walks out of the room after an initial ""hi"" and that's it. 


When I was very very little, she used to tell me how much she always wanted a [kid] like me (she has no kids) and how much fun we had when I was a wee one. Then we had a trip together with my cousin, and things didn't go so well. She was controlling and manipulative, guilt-trippy and told me I was just like my mom, as if it were derogatory. They have an okay relationship now but we still don't.

is it worth it to pursue a relationship with her at this point?

2021-02-24 10:48:20,lr9ybs,8,5,"So within the last 5 years or so, I have been growing more comfortable with the enby label.

Currently, I would identify as an androphilic AMAB intersex enby. (my intersex variation wasn't discovered until I was 33, and explained a lot of medical manifestations I have had since childhood). 

I have been trying to find more precise language to describe myself. Proxvir works since I certainly feel comfortable with masculinity, especially socially, but I have never felt ""male,"" even when I was a child. And I know some within the community feel uncomfortable with the term androphilic - so viramoric works. But, in regards to proxvir and viramoric, I really can't find much evidence that these terms are used outside a very specific community on the internet. So are these terms widely used within the enby community? Because I have definitely not experienced them outside of the internet, even among other queer and enby folk irl.

Now, I do experience gender dysphoria concerning my body (and have been working with medical professionals to possibly obtain non-binary gender affirmation surgery). I do not experience much dysphoria concerning how others perceive my gender. If people read me as male, I am perfectly fine with that. I know that some enbies talk about gender euphoria - and there are things that cause me to experience gender euphoria, but I feel extremely guilty doing/requesting them. Let me explain with an example. 

When asked for my pronouns, I tell others he/him/they/them is fine, these pronouns do not cause gender dysphoria. They are acceptable pronouns for me, but they are not my *preferred* pronouns. My preferred pronouns cause gender euphoria, but I understand that my preferred pronouns are actually quite triggering and traumatic for other trans, gnc, queer, and enby folk - so I rarely request people use them unless I am in safe company.  What are your thoughts on this? I guess for me, the harm that I would cause to my peers by requesting my preferred pronouns would probably outweigh the euphoria I would experience if others used my preferred pronouns. Does that make sense? 

The other issue I have is I feel like I am probably not welcome in the enby community. My experiences really don't align with most other enbies, but it is certainly something that I feel ""fits"" my gender identity. I am in another community that does share my experiences, and while some of them identify as neutrois, enby, agender, or even trans - many more just identify as cis men.

Is the non-binary umbrella wide enough for me?",NonBinary,"Getting more comfortable identifying as enby, but I have some questions",1614188900.0,"{'created_utc': 1614163700, 'id': 'lr9ybs', 'num_comments': 8, 'score': 5, 'selftext': 'So within the last 5 years or so, I have been growing more comfortable with the enby label.\n\nCurrently, I would identify as an androphilic AMAB intersex enby.

But, in regards to proxvir and viramoric, I really can\'t find much evidence that these terms are used outside a very specific community on the internet. So are these terms widely used within the enby community? Because I have definitely not experienced them outside of the internet, even among other queer and enby folk irl.\n\nNow, I do experience gender dysphoria concerning my body (and have been working with medical professionals to possibly obtain non-binary gender affirmation surgery). I do not experience much dysphoria concerning how others perceive my gender. If people read me as male, I am perfectly fine with that. I know that some enbies talk about gender euphoria - and there are things that cause me to experience gender euphoria, but I feel extremely guilty doing/requesting them. Let me explain with an example. \n\nWhen asked for my pronouns, I tell others he/him/they/them is fine, these pronouns do not cause gender dysphoria. They are acceptable pronouns for me, but they are not my *preferred* pronouns. My preferred pronouns cause gender euphoria, but I understand that my preferred pronouns are actually quite triggering and traumatic for other trans, gnc, queer, and enby folk - so I rarely request people use them unless I am in safe company.  What are your thoughts on this? I guess for me, the harm that I would cause to my peers by requesting my preferred pronouns would probably outweigh the euphoria I would experience if others used my preferred pronouns. Does that make sense? \n\nThe other issue I have is I feel like I am probably not welcome in the enby community. My experiences really don\'t align with most other enbies, but it is certainly something that I feel ""fits"" my gender identity. I am in another community that does share my experiences, and while some of them identify as neutrois, enby, agender, or even trans - many more just identify as cis men.\n\nIs the non-binary umbrella wide enough for me?', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Getting more comfortable identifying as enby, but I have some questions', 'created': 1614188900.0}"

I’ve never felt connections or ties to any gender, and I never felt or saw myself or the world in an inherently binary way - only acknowledging things as gendered just because of the social norm. For example: I know that in \[western\] society, makeup is seen as ‘feminine’, but I’ve never inherently seen that myself. Masculine and feminine don’t really exist to me. I mean, part of it is the awareness that gender is a social construct and a personal expression, but I feel as though it’s beyond that awareness. It’s just simply not existent for me at all. I’m not sure how else to explain it. For a while, I attributed this to the language my parents speak to me on a daily basis- Filipino languages (specifically my dialect, Capiznon), despite having borrowed Spanish words from colonisation, are gender neutral with only one pronoun. Maybe that is the case, but I think there’s a lot more to it.

I recently came out as non-binary for the reasons I have mentioned, and I now go by they/them pronouns. I felt really happy because of it, but I just feel some overwhelming guilt and nervousness around it, particularly because I’m scared of having to explain myself to and being invalidated by other non-binary or genderqueer people. I don’t necessarily experience gender dysphoria or euphoria because as I mentioned, there is a complete void of inherent gender or binary in the way I experience the world. Although, I guess I do feel discomfort with being gendered and I do feel empowered when my identity is accepted and respected. I’m also AMAB and I’m seen as masculine cis presenting to other people, but that’s not how I see myself. I’m not denying that I have cis male-presenting privilege, but I do not view myself as male presenting because for me there is no gender to how I present myself. I know there’s discourse surrounding whether ‘non-binary people should owe others androgyny’ (spoiler alert, they don’t), and I think this is exactly that. In a sense, any way I present myself, regardless of if it’s viewed as masculine or feminine, is genderless in the way I experience it. My presentation just skews more ‘masculine looking’ because of the style I like to wear in clothing, hair, etc. but is not related to my gender experience in any way. 

I guess I just wanted to vomit out how I felt to this thread to see if I’m valid in what I’m experiencing even though I’m deathly scared of being invalidated.

2021-02-24 13:53:55,lrdemc,4,5,"First post here, I just wanted somewhere I could rant/vent. 

Over the course of the pandemic, like many people I think, I've had the chance to look at myself properly and really think about who I am. I've pretty much always considered myself a tomboy, but after recentlg getting out of a relationship, I realised a great part of my discomfort was being called a 'girlfriend'. I don't feel like a girl. In an ideal world, I'd just be this genderless flat chested androgynous blob that could just go about their business. 

Last summer, after wearing a swimsuit that made me look a lot flatter, I was honestly really happy. I started researching binders, binding, anything that could make me look that flat again. I suggested it to my mother, and she asked if I wanted to transition to a man. I didn't, I don't, so I dropped it, and the whole idea of binding or minimising just kind of faded into the background noise of everything else going on.

Please feel free to just answer one of the questions rather than all of them, I know it's a lot. Or not, I know this is meant to be a space for connection and comfort, and I'm sort of the stranger who wandered in. I get that you folks deal with these questions all the time, totally understand if you just want to step in and step out. 

Also, it seems like everyone's views on the subject may differ (which is part of my confusion), so I will take responses with a grain of salt and not as the spokesperson of all nonbinary folks. 

&amp;#x200B;

Questions/Clarifications: 

My understanding is that nonbinary rejects the idea that gender exists on binary, and posits that gender is better expressed as a spectrum on which an individual's position may change. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Part of the issue seems to be the conflict of fitting into a particular box. Being on the spectrum doesn't eliminate the idea of the box, but rather creates more boxes. So is it more the ability to choose and switch between boxes? 
2. Is the spectrum based on Masculinity/Femininity? Or in other words, what is on the two polar ends of the gender spectrum? 
3. What happens when there's a societal shift in the definition of gender? For example, let's say down the line a larger part of society accepts that gender is not binary and is a spectrum (Note: I understand this is not likely to happen). 
   1. Is non-binary only relevant when used in comparison to the gender binary because the position of where an individual lies is more apparent when looked at from the spectrum? Or would it convert to a temporary-neutral-holding space for people who feel like they don't fit in/haven't figured out where they fit in on the spectrum?
4. What happens to people who identify as trans? Trans is defined by the binary, so isn't this a conflict? Or is the (assumed) larger conflict that people were limited to trans because of the binary and now there are more options? 
5. Why not expand or change the definition of what it means to be a man or woman? If we assume gender binary as being part of the M/F spectrum, then the female is a fixed bandwidth on the feminine side of the spectrum with specific roles, and the male is a fixed bandwidth on the masculine side with specific roles. The issue to me, in this case, is the rigidity of this bandwidth relative to gender. Couldn't we just expand the bandwidth so that male has the feminine side of the spectrum (e.g. you can be a man and wear makeup, and heels, a dress, and false nails AND be valid as a man), and expand female to include masculine aspects (e.g. you can be a butch who wears custom-tailored men's suits and 9-inch dildo around AND you're still valid as female and different from someone who is trans). That's how we've resolved the issue in the LGBT community where you see there's a wide array of gender expressions that are valid while straying from the traditional expectations of gender roles and expressions. Do nonbinary people feel like the system can't be changed and thus we have to opt for a different system? Or is nonbinary a solution for a different problem that I'm not conceptualising? 
6. Is this a relativist or absolute idea? Absolute meaning all cultures should do this and it should be universal, relativist meaning it's ok if other cultures don't but we happen to be one that does because there was a need for it, and that's ok
Edit 7. Is the issue more self perception or societal perception of self?

2021-02-24 17:40:14,lrikv2,13,3,"Hey everyone! 

I'm looking for someone to talk to, maybe to get some advice or some insight or something!

I am part of the LGBTQ and my partner who I have been with for a year now has recently come out as non binary, I am totally fine with that, I love everyone, but they are going through the process of changing their name and everything is really overwhelming, I've never been through this and I don't know anyone who has, so I am looking for some support in how to deal with this situation because it's overwhelming.

I know that bottom growth is more or less permanent but does the physical growth change the way you orgasm for good? Like I know for some people it goes from a rubbing motion to an up and down kind of thing but idk if that stays forever. I honestly don't really want bottom growth (I'm on fin) but I want to be prepared just in case. Below is a more concise list of Qs

- do you still get erections (if you did before)
- do you stimulate yourself the same way as you did on t 
- does it feel the same to actually cum when on t vs after t
- is the bottom growth still as sensitive post t
- if you still got erections did you find them to be less frequent if after t you were less horny?

2021-02-25 05:50:16,lrzhsl,2,1,"This is all relatively new to me, I lived in innocent afab cis bisexual bliss for years until a meme of all things decided to bitchslap me right in the gender feels. Still coming to terms with everything. Need to spew feelings into the void to sort myself out, so here goes.


First of all, the label that I currently think is fitting is demiflux. I think part of the problem is that this is a relatively obscure label (there’s all of twelve people in the subreddit) and so I’m feeling a bit of disconnect from some of the more common labels I see around here. To explain what I mean by demiflux, there’s always a small part of me that says that I’m female, sort of like a “core self” if you will, and then the rest of me says “but I really like how I look presenting masc”, some days more than others. Some days the masc feeling is gone, and I only feel femme, then other days the masc is so strong I want nothing to do with femme. So the other part of the problem is that by the very nature of my gender there are days I feel like I fit here and days I feel like I’m faking everything.


Maybe I’m just not quite used to accepting the fluctuations? But either way the imposter syndrome hits pretty hard some days. Another prt is my pronouns. I’m... not really attached to pronouns? I don’t care? So I like she/he/they or even it or whatever else people feel inclined to use. There’s no pronoun dysphoria to be had... which adds another point to the “nah you’re faking it” in my brain whenever it does that. I know it’s wrong, but aren’t we all just happy bundles of self doubt over here.


What I do know is that I started a teaching job recently and I really don’t like “Miss” as a title, and much prefer “Teacher” (Mx just really doesn’t sound right either). However, the little voice makes me question if that’s actually because I want it, or if I just feel the need to “be seen” - because if I go by Miss, then there’s no difference from being cis. (Really accepting school, by the way, super happy to be working there with my wife). 


Another thing I know is that I do dislike my voice being relatively high pitched, but solely for the reason that I can’t pass on masc days the moment I open my mouth. Little voice says “you don’t need to pass as male, you’re enby right, you just want a lower voice to make it more obvious to people you’re not cis, because that’s not allowed at all, is it? Just be a guy with a high voice and help break gender norms.” Shut up, little voice.


Point three (not that I’m counting) - I want to keep my long hair because I adore long hair, it’s soft and I dye it fun colors (it’s currently a super subtle green/blue/purple) but that makes it much harder to pass as masc... and as I start listing off ways I want to be able to pass masc, it adds to the confusion, because I don’t think I’m binary trans but everything I’ve been focusing on for weeks is being able to pass as a male, and I know I want to microdose T for a lower voice, and I think I’ll want top surgery eventually as part of passing, but what about femme days? Guess I can just pad a bra, but now I’m questioning if the femme days are all a lie my brain has made up because I’m scared of being ftm trans, and because I’ve never had very strong dysphoria, it’s all about “theoretically I’d like this” and “well this is sort of euphoric”.


And there are days I still like femme presenting and feel fabulous and amazing that way! But I don’t know if that’s just general body confidence and nice clothes or if it’s the actual femme aspect I like. Not to shoot anyone else down but I almost wish I had crippling dysphoria so that I could at least figure out “this is a no”, but everything I try is “this is chill” with occasional small “oh this is extra nice” that’s very vague. Guess I’m still an enby for now, just a very confused one under the very large and vague umbrella of “not strictly within the gender binary”. I’m cisn’t, that’s all I’ve got.


It’s just frustrating because I don’t know where to experiment next? I got a binder, I got mens clothes, my wardrobe looks great. I have no attachment at all to pronouns so there’s not much experimenting to do over there. I have no clue what I want in a name but I’m not incredibly dysphoric over my feminine birth name (yet?) so I’m putting up with it for now til I figure something else out over there. Appearance, check. Pronouns, check. Name, getting there. Hormones, on the way (prescribed but haven’t started). What next? I feel like I’m missing something still, but I don’t know what. My mind won’t stop turning. I feel like I have all the answers but at the same time I don’t have any of them. I guess “sit tight and wait a few months” is probably the best answer, especially as the T will take time to do anything, but as patient as I am with other people, sitting and doing absolutely nothing for myself right now feels uncomfortable.

Still coming to terms with everything. Need to spew feelings into the void to sort myself out, so here goes.\n\n\nFirst of all, the label that I currently think is fitting is demiflux. I think part of the problem is that this is a relatively obscure label (there’s all of twelve people in the subreddit) and so I’m feeling a bit of disconnect from some of the more common labels I see around here. To explain what I mean by demiflux, there’s always a small part of me that says that I’m female, sort of like a “core self” if you will, and then the rest of me says “but I really like how I look presenting masc”, some days more than others. Some days the masc feeling is gone, and I only feel femme, then other days the masc is so strong I want nothing to do with femme. So the other part of the problem is that by the very nature of my gender there are days I feel like I fit here and days I feel like I’m faking everything.\n\n\nMaybe I’m just not quite used to accepting the fluctuations? But either way the imposter syndrome hits pretty hard some days. Another prt is my pronouns. I’m... not really attached to pronouns? I don’t care? So I like she/he/they or even it or whatever else people feel inclined to use. There’s no pronoun dysphoria to be had... which adds another point to the “nah you’re faking it” in my brain whenever it does that. I know it’s wrong, but aren’t we all just happy bundles of self doubt over here.\n\n\nWhat I do know is that I started a teaching job recently and I really don’t like “Miss” as a title, and much prefer “Teacher” (Mx just really doesn’t sound right either). However, the little voice makes me question if that’s actually because I want it, or if I just feel the need to “be seen” - because if I go by Miss, then there’s no difference from being cis. (Really accepting school, by the way, super happy to be working there with my wife). \n\n\nAnother thing I know is that I do dislike my voice being relatively high pitched, but solely for the reason that I can’t pass on masc days the moment I open my mouth. Little voice says “you don’t need to pass as male, you’re enby right, you just want a lower voice to make it more obvious to people you’re not cis, because that’s not allowed at all, is it? Just be a guy with a high voice and help break gender norms.” Shut up, little voice.\n\n\nPoint three (not that I’m counting) - I want to keep my long hair because I adore long hair, it’s soft and I dye it fun colors (it’s currently a super subtle green/blue/purple) but that makes it much harder to pass as masc... and as I start listing off ways I want to be able to pass masc, it adds to the confusion, because I don’t think I’m binary trans but everything I’ve been focusing on for weeks is being able to pass as a male, and I know I want to microdose T for a lower voice, and I think I’ll want top surgery eventually as part of passing, but what about femme days? Guess I can just pad a bra, but now I’m questioning if the femme days are all a lie my brain has made up because I’m scared of being ftm trans, and because I’ve never had very strong dysphoria, it’s all about “theoretically I’d like this” and “well this is sort of euphoric”.\n\n\nAnd there are days I still like femme presenting and feel fabulous and amazing that way! But I don’t know if that’s just general body confidence and nice clothes or if it’s the actual femme aspect I like. Not to shoot anyone else down but I almost wish I had crippling dysphoria so that I could at least figure out “this is a no”, but everything I try is “this is chill” with occasional small “oh this is extra nice” that’s very vague. Guess I’m still an enby for now, just a very confused one under the very large and vague umbrella of “not strictly within the gender binary”. I’m cisn’t, that’s all I’ve got.\n\n\nIt’s just frustrating because I don’t know where to experiment next? I got a binder, I got mens clothes, my wardrobe looks great. I have no attachment at all to pronouns so there’s not much experimenting to do over there. I have no clue what I want in a name but I’m not incredibly dysphoric over my feminine birth name (yet?) so I’m putting up with it for now til I figure something else out over there. Appearance, check. Pronouns, check. Name, getting there. Hormones, on the way (prescribed but haven’t started). What next? I feel like I’m missing something still, but I don’t know what. My mind won’t stop turning. I feel like I have all the answers but at the same time I don’t have any of them. I guess “sit tight and wait a few months” is probably the best answer, especially as the T will take time to do anything, but as patient as I am with other people, sitting and doing absolutely nothing for myself right now feels uncomfortable.

2021-02-25 10:42:50,ls3the,12,1,"Dramatic title aside, I need help haha.

First off, I'm 16, AFAB. As young child, I didn't give a flying donkey's arsehole about gender stuff- I was your typical ""girly girl"" dresses, dolls- the lot. Got to about 8, hated skirts above the knee- had to wear shorts under school skirts and despised this frilly thing I used to have.

Anyway- skip forward to when I was in year 8, realising that I may be asexual, cutting my hair short and not identify as anything other than a furry goth. I moved schools, stopped being goth because I didn't want to get bullied, hid being a furry, and these feelings of dysphoria got worse- by year 9, i was having mental breakdowns all too often. I thought i was trans ftm- for about 6 months, until I realised I thought I was trans for the wrong reasons.

So lets skip forward to 2 days ago (tuesday), where I was speaking with my therapist. She asked me about what I feel about gender, and  I realised, once again, that I feel non binary- and that the feelings never really changed.

But my dilemma is that I feel non binary (androgynous), but I still want long hair. (Currently growing out a pixie cut from when I thought I was trans)
I get top dysphoria, (I want a flat chest with no nips) and I wish there was a surgery for afab which essentially gave you a hole to pee out of, and a hysterectomy.

As young child, I didn\'t give a flying donkey\'s arsehole about gender stuff- I was your typical ""girly girl"" dresses, dolls- the lot. Got to about 8, hated skirts above the knee- had to wear shorts under school skirts and despised this frilly thing I used to have.\n\nAnyway- skip forward to when I was in year 8, realising that I may be asexual, cutting my hair short and not identify as anything other than a furry goth. I moved schools, stopped being goth because I didn\'t want to get bullied, hid being a furry, and these feelings of dysphoria got worse- by year 9, i was having mental breakdowns all too often. I thought i was trans ftm- for about 6 months, until I realised I thought I was trans for the wrong reasons.\n\nSo lets skip forward to 2 days ago (tuesday), where I was speaking with my therapist. She asked me about what I feel about gender, and  I realised, once again, that I feel non binary- and that the feelings never really changed.\n\nBut my dilemma is that I feel non binary (androgynous), but I still want long hair. (Currently growing out a pixie cut from when I thought I was trans)\nI get top dysphoria, (I want a flat chest with no nips) and I wish there was a surgery for afab which essentially gave you a hole to pee out of, and a hysterectomy.\nSo question is, what the actual fuck am I?\n\nIf you\'ve got this far, have my poor mans gold 🏅\nAdvice would be very helpful, thanks :)', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Help with my Gender delusions', 'created': 1614274970.0}"

2021-02-25 15:38:05,ls9ah3,16,0,"Hi everyone,

I'm a cis male and I'm trying to make an effort to learn more about trans people, particularly those who are non-binary. Let me start by saying, I am a bit ignorant, and really don't want to make anyone feel bad. If anything I say here is problematic, I welcome being called out, honestly! I hope this is the right place to ask, and I get that this subreddit is not for the cis dudes of the world, so if I'm out of line I trust that the moderators will take this down, and if so, I'm sorry! 

Personally, I feel like I have a decent understanding of trans in the binary sense. But when it comes to non-binary people, they/them pronouns, etc, I find myself having difficulty wrapping my head around it. I have no issues with using people's preferred pronouns, despite not always ""getting it."" My general ethos is that if someone is saying, ""hey, I feel respected if you refer to me in the following way,"" it doesn't really matter if it ""get it"" or not-- I want the people I meet in life to feel respected and comfortable when interacting with me. Using a different pronoun is no skin off my back, so I really don't understand why someone would dig their heels in and refuse. If I meet someone named Michael, and I call them Mike, and they say, ""actually, it's Michael,"" I don't argue or throw a fit... a pronoun doesn't seem any different to me.

That being said, I WANT to understand!! Unfortunately I have never been close enough to any non-binary people to really delve into a deep discussion, so I am limited to things I read. And from what I've read, I gather that choosing they/them pronouns is often because the person doesn't want to be beholden to gender expectations based on their genitals. Fair enough. However, I don't quite understand why that requires a different pronoun. 

Why not simply go by traditional pronouns and live your life in a way that challenges society's expectations of gender performance? Despite being a cis gay male, I DESPISE the moment at a hetero wedding where the gals catch a bouquet and the guys catch a garter. I don't want to do either of those things! As a little boy, I wanted to wear a pearl necklace like my grandma. My family never discouraged that. I suppose what I'm saying is that personally, I sometimes choose to defy gender expectations, yet am quite comfortable with being perceived as a ""male."" If someone has an expectation that I should or shouldn't do something because of my gender, then-- that's their problem, not mine. 

So for those of you who sail somewhere between the poles on the sea of gender-- what do you get out of choosing they/them pronouns? Do you feel that frees you from social expectations related to gender? If so, do you feel it frees you from social expectations MORE than if you were to simply defy them?

I came out to my girlfriend today. We have a long distance relationship and we've been talking for months now even though we've never seen each other since I'm living on a different continent (we facetime like 3 times a week for at least 3 or 4 hours). Our plan was to make it through covid and see if we connect in real life so we can eventually move together. She's the sweetest girl and we connect in so many different ways. Our bond is extremely deep even though there are a couple differences.

There was always something that felt weird and yesterday for some reason everything clicked so I tried to communicate my feelings. I talked about feeling agender/androgynous my whole life, how I feel about clothes and gender expression and the signs I've seen over the years. She's actually the first person to hear these things from me.
We both struggled with mental health for years and recently it got worse again because of financial and personal issues. Our plan was to live alone for the rest of our lives (before we met). The only thing she said was that she needs time to think and that it's a lot to digest and that she loves me. I expected those words even though they just didn't feel right. All this happiness and freedom I experienced the last 24 hours before telling her kind of disappeared and I'm experiencing extreme gender dysphoria again when I see myself in the mirror. It's probably going to be temporary but I just want to be free once and for all, without losing the people I love. We connect in so many ways but I just don't want to keep hurting people.

If you are a **non-binary video game player**  you are invited to participate in a short survey and a short interview  that will investigate avatar choice and creation in video games. As you  are likely very aware, avatar options in video games typically follow  the gender binary and offer little to no non-binary or customizable  gender options. **This study seeks  to understand how non-binary players navigate avatar options and their  desires for gender identification and expression options in video games.**

The  interviews will be conducted by Xan Smith (Ph.D. student) and Dr.  Nicole Martins of the Media School at Indiana University, Bloomington.  Nicole has previously conducted research on video games and Xan herself  is an avid gamer and an advocate for gender inclusivity and LGBTQIA  rights. Participation involves an in-take survey to collect contact  information and confirm eligibility for the study and a **single interview** via Zoom or phone. All participants will be given one $20 Amazon gift card following the interview.

If  you are at least 18 years old, identify as non-binary, play multiplayer  online video games at least once every other week for the last 6  months, and would like more information about participating, please  contact: Xan Smith (me) at [alesmit@indiana.edu](mailto:alesmit@indiana.edu) or Nicole Martins at [nicomart@indiana.edu](mailto:nicomart@indiana.edu). **Interviews will last approximately 1 hour to 1 hour and 30 minutes.** Feel free to DM me if you have any questions.",NonBinary,Non-Binary Video Game Avatar Study - Call for Applicants,1614298328.0,"{'created_utc': 1614273128, 'id': 'lsbhq3', 'num_comments': 4, 'score': 2, 'selftext': 'Non-Binary Video Game Avatar Study\n\nIf you are a **non-binary video game player**  you are invited to participate in a short survey and a short interview  that will investigate avatar choice and creation in video games.

So, I’m bi, I’ve known that for years now. And this has - as one would expect - involved fantasies about having a girlfriend and about having a boyfriend.

But since I’ve been seriously gender questioning, my role in these fantasies changes. If I’m with a girl, I’m a girl (I’m AFAB), but generally an androgynous one and almost always the more feminine/sub of the pair. If I’m with a guy, I’m transmasc (and generally but not always, he is also trans) or I’m a more masc/domineering woman (think r/RoleReversal). As funny as it sounds, it seems like “whichever is gay” determines my gender in these fantasies. Or more accurately, the gender dynamic of my fantasy relationship determines what I’m most comfortable with.

I don’t know what’s going on. I’m pretty sure this isn’t right; my gender is supposed to feel right even when I’m alone. But “having” a partner gives me an anchor. FYI- my label at the moment is “transmasc nonbinary.” 

And of course, there’s the fact that I can’t tell (in real life) the difference between “do I just like it,” “do I want to be that,” “do I want to look like that”, and “do I want to be with someone like that?” Just - ugh.

I have always presented as M (AMAB) but since puberty I have always felt there was a strong F side to me. Since then I’ve felt good wearing F clothes sometimes and fantasised about being a girl in a sex situation (but with a F top). But have always been straight-M publicly.

I go through periods in my life where I will embrace the F side more and more (always in private) but then will feel such shame and purge and live wholly M for a while, but it always creeps back. I had some medical issues earlier in life which has left me with low T, but still developed (lower voice, body hair etc). I have issues with body hair, I don’t like it but have tolerated it, occasionally will hate it and pull some of it out.

I’m confused and think I sit under NB, probably GF because of the ebb and flow, but struggle with sexuality (or maybe none apply and I’m just weird).

She has no idea I’ve hidden this for 20 years (I think) and am terrified of her finding out, because I don’t know how she would then view our relationship, romantically and sexually - and I wouldn’t want to challenge her.

2021-02-25 19:19:35,lsegqq,8,6,"Hi everyone ! 

Its my first time posting here.

I recently ""discovered"" that I was non-binary and its just confusing. I have all these mixed feelings about myself and I don't feel valid at all. It seems like I can't figure out what I want for myself and it's starting to be so overwhelming.

First of all, I'm AFAB and I prefer go for the they/them pronouns but I don't mind if ***sometimes*** i get refered as a she. But like no more than one sentence... It's just so weird. 

I'm in a relationship and my girlfriend supports me a 100% and I'm really grateful for that. I like when I get called ""baby girl"" or ""girlfriend"" or ""future wife"" by her, but I don't like being refered as a woman by anyone else. 

I also would like to change my name at some point for a more neutral one but I don't feel like I deserve it because of all the questions I have about myself.

It's just so hard because I've never felt more comfortable with myself than since I came out to my girlfriend and close friends, but also all the changes are getting overwhelming and I'm scared it's gonna be overwhelming for them too and ending up leaving me.

&amp;#x200B;

And How did you overcame it?",NonBinary,I'm confused.,1614305975.0,"{'created_utc': 1614280775, 'id': 'lsegqq', 'num_comments': 8, 'score': 6, 'selftext': 'Hi everyone ! \n\nIts my first time posting here.\n\nI recently ""discovered"" that I was non-binary and its just confusing.

2021-02-25 23:37:51,lsk8nu,12,5,"Hello all!

I had a look through several search pages on this sub, but I couldn't quite find the sort of 'writing help' situation that I am in.

I'm a trans female writer who is working on a book with an NB protagonist. While a key part of their backstory does relate to leaving home due to their parents not approving of their gender identity, the bulk of the book is a mystery novel mixed with drama and romantic elements, with essentially nothing outside of the backstory having to do with the protagonist being NB.

It is mentioned that they are casually/accidentally misgendered off-screen by strangers, but they are never misgendered at any place in the book itself and no 'hints' are dropped as to what gender they were assigned at birth, for fear that readers might see such things as 'hints' to 'what they REALLY are'.

However: after reading Noelle Stevenson's touching comic 'The Top 2' around the same time I was working on a chapter that feature's the protagonist's romantic interest (at this point, still a friend) suffering due to her having really heavy periods (included in this book due to an extreme lack of representation in fiction of this unpleasant part of life that all women having to go through, and written in consultation with a close friend who suffers in such a manner)...

It occurred to me that it would be perfectly natural for the love interest to ask the protagonist, who I will say here is AFAB (or else this post will get very confusing), how they feel/cope with having their period, due to the added complication of them being NB and thus the potential for gender dysphoria to kick in.

The conversation, in private and between close friends, would be relatively brief (half a page or a page at most), and touch upon how it affects the protagonist (which I would write after reading through various different experiences by NB people who have periods and how it affects them, so I can make the protagonist's response appropriate and feel authentic; not just something that I've made up).

This could lead into a tangent about whether or not the protagonist is considering top surgery (which, if the protagonist IS considering it [and I imagine they would be], they know such things would have to be postponed for the meantime due to story and financial reasons).

My question is: in this novel (and the two planned sequels), do you think the protagonist should:

A - Remain completely free from any 'hints' as to the gender they were assigned at birth (taking the She-Ra and Steven Universe route), while avoiding the 'mystery androgyny' clichés that crop up often in LGBTQ+ fiction (although done flawlessly in the aforementioned animated series).

or B - Permit a private conversation and a related scene or two later on where their assigned-at-birth gender is discussed (while avoiding completely free of misgenderings and all the stereotypical bullying clichés that comes with a lot of LGBTQ+ fiction), as part of depicting a realistic and authentic NB character, along with struggles such as gender dysphoria (with such things still being an incredibly small part of the character and the story as a whole).

2021-02-26 00:50:11,lslp5g,4,1,"Hello everyone! I am a fashion student and am currently working on a project involving marketing towards people who identify outside the gender binary.

The project is a simulation exercise about designing a collection launch and promotional campaign for the store Monki which is a member of the H&amp;M group. The collection will be for the autumn/winter season and is aimed at those identifying outside the gender binary. In order to complete the project I am required to conduct discussion-based research into the relationship between fashion marketing and the target demographic. This information will then be used to come up with the promotional campaign and launch event.

I have created a discord server for the research portion of the project where hopefully I can host a focus group over voice chat at some point in the near future. This would take maximum an hour and can be arranged to suit any time zone. If people aren’t comfortable with voice chat then it can also be done via text chat and I could arrange the channels by topic. I will post the project brief and mood board for the collection on the discord for reference if you want more information. All information will remain completely anonymous.

2021-02-26 16:56:45,lt1y2c,0,1," Hello everyone! I am a fashion student and am currently working on a project involving marketing towards people who identify outside the gender binary.

The project is a simulation exercise about designing a collection launch and promotional campaign for the store Monki which is a member of the H&amp;M group. The collection will be for the autumn/winter season and is aimed at those identifying outside the gender binary. In order to complete the project I am required to conduct discussion-based research into the relationship between fashion marketing and the target demographic. This information will then be used to come up with the promotional campaign and launch event.

I have created a discord server for the research portion of the project where hopefully I can host a focus group over voice chat at some point in the near future. This would take maximum an hour and can be arranged to suit any time zone. If people aren’t comfortable with voice chat then it can also be done via text chat and I could arrange the channels by topic. I will post the project brief and mood board for the collection on the discord for reference if you want more information. All information will remain completely anonymous.

I would really appreciate any and all participation you are willing to offer. Please do not hesitate to DM me if you require more information. Thank you!

some background: i am black and indian (blindian for short), 21, 5’5 and 170 lbs. i am not on T. i’ve been wanting top surgery my entire life, but it was not feasible till now.

1. for any black ppl/POCs: how was your healing/scarring process? i’ve mainly seen white folks, so it would be nice to hear about your personal experiences.

2. I am getting the Inverted-T procedure. does anyone have any advice/tips about this specific surgery?

3. I’m getting it done overseas (i really trust the doctor and i don’t have insurance). Will i be able to sit on a 7-hour flight 16 days post op? it’s really worrying me.

4. I am a student, how long should i take off from my classes post op? i have a pretty high pain tolerance and all of my classes are online, but i want to let my professors know beforehand what i’m capable of.

5. i am overweight (i have a fat stomach). how did y’all deal with the body dysmorphia post op? i’m scared that i will hate how i look bc my stomach will be protruding out more.

6. i love running and cardio, but boobs/winter/being broke have made it really hard to stay in shape. i’m really looking forward to exercising post op. to anyone who has lost a lot of weight post op, what was your experience like? does your chest look any different?

7. has anyone had any issues with bigots/assholes post surgery? i’m usually not afraid of going off on people, but when it comes to my body i’m very self-conscious.

8. i know i want this surgery, but i’m scared i will regret it. my anxiety keeps telling me i’ll hate how i look. can y’all just drop some advice for this feeling or explain how much euphoria you’re feeling post op?

2021-02-26 18:13:21,lt3y94,3,2,"[TW because of (maybe???) descriminating comments and mentions of mental health issues] 

It happened yesterday and I feel like I am slowly going crazy about it. I don't know if I experienced something descriminating or if I am overreacting. Please, if you have a little time, let me explain the situation and tell me honestly what you think about it. It would be very helpful.

I am currently in training at a place where I get help to find a job again after having quit my previous one due to mental health issues. There are trainers, but also psychologists who I talk a lot about work and the struggles I face at work, but besides of the training I am in therapy with a different psychologist (Private).

For a while now, I thought about coming out as nonbinary at the training place and see, how I feel with it. It is supposed to be a safe place, so I figured it would be a better first step than doing it later at a real job. I also talked to my private psychologist about it beforhand and she was really encouraging to do this.

So last Monday, I talked to the staff at the training place as well as the people I do the training with about it and asked them, if they could refer gender neutral to me from now on. It was a bit hard to explain to some of them, but overall the reactions varied from neutral to very supportive, so I was happy. Some of the staff still struggles with it, but I can totally understand that after just one week. I know how long my wife took until she got used to it, so I expected other people to take even longer.

I even expected people, who don't understand it and have a problem with it, but I was ready to take this as a little challenge to stand up for myself.

But as I said, all people are pretty fine with it. All, except the psychologist at the training place. They said they struggle a little, but try their best. But they refused to use a gender neutral form when addressing me and call me by my first and last name now, what is kinda as uncomfortable as being called 'Mrs' because my official first name is obviously a very feminine one. But this alone wouldn't bother me. It is not to only thing though. 

Yesterday we talked, it was about some organasitory stuff actually, but than they put the topic on my gender identity again. I try to make it short and sum up the things they said that made me uncomfortable:

- when I said being called with my first and last name is still uncomfortable, they did not understand even when I explained them the reason and refused to use the prefix similiar to the english ""Mx"" which other of the staff have no problem in using when talking or writing Mails to me

- they asked if I was intersexual by directly asking what my genitalia is like

- they said if it is nothing physical but a choice, I should better not tell anyone at a job I am nonbinary because I won't be able to work there then and I can't deal with negative reactions anyway 

- they asked if it was a trans thing and if I take it serious enough to get surgery and my gender changed in my official documents, stressing the point that it is very hard to do that in my country and asking if this is really worth it, when I am not really trans (even though I talked about the dysphoria I have) 

- they asked if I talked with my private psychologist about being nonbinary, because it is important to find out, what in my past caused me to be like that

- they refused to write my gender identity into any of the documents they have to write about me, because ""it would be bad for me"" if they did

- they often said how hard it for everyone is to get used to addressing to me gender neutrally

- they filled out a form where they had to tick a box for my gender and there only were the options ""male"" and ""female"" they commented with something like ""See, it's even to much for our computer programs""

... It may very a bit, because I had to translate it into english now, but this kinda was the essence of what they said. But after every statement they said stuff like ""But you get one I am saying, right? I don't mean it in a harmful way"" and stuff like that...

So...I didn't know what to say and simply wanted to get out of the situation as fast as possible, but realised I had to talk to them again today, because, as I said, they are my psychologist at this place. I have to trust them, but I just can't because I feel so uncomfortable now after being open about my gender identity. They were not there today, so I hope I can talk to them next week.

But, as I said, I am slowly going nuts over what happened. I have problems with respecting myself and my personal needs aswell as opening up to others, so the feeling that I wish I had never talked about this topic at all is a major setback for me. Even around other people I felt a lot more uncomfortable suddenly again. But I am so afraid I am overreacting and making a big fuss about something that maybe should have stayed a personal thing.

I really don't know... So... Please, any kind of opinion would me helpful right now.

2021-02-26 18:48:54,lt4rd2,2,12,"I've been out as NB for about a year now.  Up to this point I've not really experienced that much hate.  Some nasty comments here or there, but nothing that I would consider that terrible.

Today I was brigaded relentlessly.  I responded to a question on r/TooAfraidToAsk about sex, and casually mentioned that I'm NB with a penis.  My inbox was absolutely flooded with assholes maliciously misgendering me and making nasty comments.  I reported them to the mods of the sub, but they did nothing.  It was so bad that I wound up deleting all of my posts just to stop the notifications.

That wasn't the worst part, though.  An hour goes by and I get a message from Reddit saying that somebody flagged my comment as a suicide risk and included links to suicide prevention resources.  I have never posted anything on Reddit suggesting that I wanted to kill myself.  Somebody thought it would be cute to use Reddit to tell me to kill myself.

My feelings aren't really hurt.  I've dealt with bullying since I was a kid.  I'm just disappointed with people.  There was a part of me that hoped that I wouldn't personally experience harassment like this, but clearly I was wrong.

Why does my lack of gender offend you?  How does it affect you personally?  I just don't understand why someone is so concerned with this one aspect of my identity.  It feels like attacking me because I'm a musician.  It just doesn't affect you, not even tacitly.  If you don't like playing music, then don't identify as a musician.  If you're not NB, then identify with a binary gender.  I don't care what you do because I have *so many* more important things to worry about than how someone else presents themselves to the world.  I truly could not imagine spending that much time, effort, and energy to harass someone for no benefit to me.  It must be nice going through life with that much time on your hands.

2021-02-27 04:12:54,ltfyku,32,45,"Ok so to be fair this happened a year ago so I should probably be over it by now but I'm NOT so here we go.

So I was dating a trans girl and about a year into our relationship  I told her that I was thinking of identifying as nonbinary. it was something that I thought about a lot. At first she was very supportive, but it kind of went downhill.

She was very obsessed with physical appearances. She once told me that she wouldn't have children because she wasn't able to love them if they turned out to be ugly. By her own admission she was only nice to people who she thought were attractive.

I started doing little things to express myself differently. I bought a binder and I would wear my hair inside my hats and hoods to see what it would look like shorter, but nothing too crazy. I was really confused because she would tell me how cute I was and how happy I looked and then five minutes later yell at me for some unrelated reason. One time she yelled at me because the wind messed up her hair, my god I wish I was kidding. To rationalize this I assumed she was being cruel to me because she no longer found me pretty.

One night  I took my binder off in front of her. She looked at my chest and very sadly  said ""Oh your breasts changed shape because of your binder"" and I will never forget the look of disgust and disappointment on her face. I was mortified. I don't even think they changed shape???

She also supports youtubers like blaire white, even when they say shitty things about nonbinary people or misgender them on purpose. She told me that she doesn't consider nonbinary people to be transgender, and I felt like I didn't have the authority to argue with a trans person about who is allowed to ID as trans so I just sort of said ""ok"" and tried not to worry about it.

She was also maybe emotionally abusive but that's another topic lol

I guess it still bothers me now. I present more feminine these days because if I try to present myself in an androgynous way I worry that I am ugly. I should probably go to therapy.

I’d like to preface this by apologizing if this is the wrong subreddit to post this to (if it is, please let me know!). I am a cis person who has a couple questions for and about enbies, and I didn’t find anything while looking through the archives that answered them:

-On alternating dual pronouns: I’ve heard a lot of complaints from people who use dual pronouns that others only use one pronoun, and it makes them feel like their identity is being erased. I want to make any environment a comfortable one for all included, so what would be the best way to alternate pronouns? Every day? In the same sentence? Should I ask them which one they prefer in any given interaction, or is that too often?

-on sexuality: I was told awhile ago that ‘because NB people are not male or female, it was invalidating to them if a heterosexual or homosexual person dated them while maintaining that identity’. However, I also recently encountered a post that said that it was enbyphobic to suggest that gay men couldn’t date or be attracted to NB people.

2021-02-27 14:51:21,ltpo3f,0,2,"Hello beautiful people:

I myself do not identify as nonbinary, but I have close people who do, which is part of the reason why I'm here.

As someone who is not, I've found that being able to have a framework helped my understanding of the phenomenon. Furthermore, I think that although gender is a spectrum, the colour spectrum is not the best way to explain as the metaphor breaks down and gets confusing at parts.

Why is this important: Let me first make this clear that the existence ""workable model"" doesn't validate or invalidate anyone (that's innate and automatic). However, I think that having a model is important in terms of being able to have a conversation because at least we're pulling from the same framework in our respective minds. This may not be able to explain everything, but I think it explains enough to progress the conversation on a larger scale.

I was wondering if I could get feedback to hear thoughts on this explanation, and also potential concerns that I may not being seeing.

So I present to you an alternate model as a means to explain: Primary Colours of Light

[https://imgur.com/a/HdOxD41](https://imgur.com/a/HdOxD41)

I chose the primary colour of light for a few reasons:

1. There are no hard borders
2. Primary colours in different ratio combinations can create the full spectrum of the rainbow (if you own a Bluetooth led colour light bulb, you'll notice that the entire colour wheel is made up of these 3 colours).
3. To me, it seems like cultural and societal definitions of gender (gender roles, gender expression, other gender normalities) seems to play an important role. This can be accounted for by the shifting of the lights which would, in turn, create different types of overlap.
4. The overlap (and more specifically, the amount of overlap) is constantly shifting based on time and place. When all 3 are overlapped like the above-linked image, you see there's a white light in the middle which I would take as non-binary (\* non-binary is still under the umbrella of trans when this overlap isn't there overall 3, but I think it makes complete sense to put nonbinary there.

Quick note: When the 3 are overlapped, it makes sense to put agender at the very centre of the entire thing.

&amp;#x200B;

Model in action:

Red light = female

Blue light = male

Green light = trans.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Example of information you could pull from this/how to use model:

\*note, you can tailor the lights to help highlight specific things at a given time/space.

1. In societies with a recognised third gender, it was exclusively (or almost exclusively) male to female and not female to male, so that would be seen with the trans light and female light overlapped completely or trans light and female light overlapped but not completely, and none of the green trans light touching the male light.
2. With this, you can also see how a female and male could encompass the same space (overlap red and blue) and still maintain separate identities. This could be a more feminine man and a gender-nonconforming female for example.
3. You could ask relevant questions like why is there a lack of integration/overlap between two lights at a point in time/space? What would be the consequences of shifting the light in x way, and where and how much would overlap?
4. You could make statements like any area the blue light encompasses is a man (so trans is man and male is a man) but any place with overlap the individual may opt-out (so non-conforming female does not identify as a male, but you also see why a society could confuse her for such if she fell here)
5. You can see and pinpoint a trans, non-binary, nonconforming woman.

Masculinity and feminity are not accounted for, but instead, at the overlap, you have similarities which *could* be roles or expression based of feminine/masculine qualities, **but** it is not exclusively so as this changes as a society changes, and consequently the definition changes as well. Thus Mas/Fem may not be stable variable at that point in time/space.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to keep this short and to the point, but can answer or clarify anything if some parts are confusing or feel inaccurate (could be a wording issue on my part).

Any comments would be super appreciated. Does this feel like it explains it accurately? What are your concerns? Do you guys know of a better model?

Added side note:

You could, if you wanted, also flip it and make it multiaxis and denote colour nuances at the overlaps (since different amounts of colours mixed to produce a different array of colours as mentioned earlier).  But I feel like the 3D only makes sense if you understand the 2D, which I think people are having a hard time visualising and/or interpreting if they have no connection to the community.",NonBinary,Better Model to Explain Gender: Primary Colours of Light,1614462681.0,"{'created_utc': 1614437481, 'id': 'ltpo3f', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 2, 'selftext': 'Hello beautiful people:\n\nI myself do not identify as nonbinary, but I have close people who do, which is part of the reason why I\'m here.\n\nAs someone who is not, I\'ve found that being able to have a framework helped my understanding of the phenomenon.

When all 3 are overlapped like the above-linked image, you see there\'s a white light in the middle which I would take as non-binary (\\* non-binary is still under the umbrella of trans when this overlap isn\'t there overall 3, but I think it makes complete sense to put nonbinary there.\n\nQuick note: When the 3 are overlapped, it makes sense to put agender at the very centre of the entire thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nModel in action:\n\nRed light = female\n\nBlue light = male\n\nGreen light = trans.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExample of information you could pull from this/how to use model:\n\n\\*note, you can tailor the lights to help highlight specific things at a given time/space.\n\n1. In societies with a recognised third gender, it was exclusively (or almost exclusively) male to female and not female to male, so that would be seen with the trans light and female light overlapped completely or trans light and female light overlapped but not completely, and none of the green trans light touching the male light.\n2. With this, you can also see how a female and male could encompass the same space (overlap red and blue) and still maintain separate identities. This could be a more feminine man and a gender-nonconforming female for example.\n3. You could ask relevant questions like why is there a lack of integration/overlap between two lights at a point in time/space? What would be the consequences of shifting the light in x way, and where and how much would overlap?\n4. You could make statements like any area the blue light encompasses is a man (so trans is man and male is a man) but any place with overlap the individual may opt-out (so non-conforming female does not identify as a male, but you also see why a society could confuse her for such if she fell here)\n5. You can see and pinpoint a trans, non-binary, nonconforming woman.\n\nMasculinity and feminity are not accounted for, but instead, at the overlap, you have similarities which *could* be roles or expression based of feminine/masculine qualities, **but** it is not exclusively so as this changes as a society changes, and consequently the definition changes as well. Thus Mas/Fem may not be stable variable at that point in time/space.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to keep this short and to the point, but can answer or clarify anything if some parts are confusing or feel inaccurate (could be a wording issue on my part).\n\nAny comments would be super appreciated. Does this feel like it explains it accurately? What are your concerns? Do you guys know of a better model?\n\nAdded side note:\n\nYou could, if you wanted, also flip it and make it multiaxis and denote colour nuances at the overlaps (since different amounts of colours mixed to produce a different array of colours as mentioned earlier).  But I feel like the 3D only makes sense if you understand the 2D, which I think people are having a hard time visualising and/or interpreting if they have no connection to the community.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Better Model to Explain Gender: Primary Colours of Light', 'created': 1614462681.0}"

P.s. this might be long and feels like a rant (I hope it isn't), but I just have so much background information that needs to be added in order to make this clear. 

P.P.S. I am autistic so these things are really hard for me to talk about and recognize for myself, and I would really appreciate it for people to be kind with me (please know that I am trying my best to understand myself). I want to also add a trigger warning for unhealthy relationships and denial of the existence of trans people. 

I have been asking the question about my gender, it took me a while to even ask the question to myself. I come from a culture where it is mandatory to be cis and straight. It also doesn't help that I am on the spectrum, where it is really hard for me to realize things about myself and the world. I never felt like I belong anywhere, so I decided to leave. I finally left my home country and came to Canada, I started my life as who I am. I chose Canada because it is a safer place for queer people compared to other places I have looked at. I've always known my sexuality isn't straight, so I started experimenting with the title Bi which then shifted to Pan after a few years of exploration, and now I am very comfortable with that. 

I was very gullible and young when I came to a far away country on my own, and I saw Canada as this safe haven where everyone is accepting. But I ended up in an unhealthy relationship with a cis-straight man who doesn't believe in genders unless they are cis (But says that he supports his enby/trans friends, but only based on his attraction towards them? You know what I mean.). He instilled in on me on ""how happy he is that I am cis but always trying to break the gender roles and gender rules"" and ""how I showed those asian international students that you can be a woman who acts with no care about society's standard."" (I am asian). It's like he is preaching a form of feminism that isn't the most inclusive towards trans people, and kind of racist too. This has made me feel a little scared about the possibility of being trans. 

My now-ex has a brother whose partner is a nonbinary person. My ex firmly believed that his brother's partner is just faking it at being nonbinary, because to him, they are just doing it because his brother is Pan (idk it doesn't make any sense to me either at that time). I remember being pretty close to them, and I remember feeling like.. ""man, it must be so nice to be nonbinary."" but I also remember feeling... ""but If i am nonbinary, I am scared that no one will accept me."". So I remember brushing off that feeling, and acted as if I have never felt that way. 

Thankfully, I noticed that after 2 years that it wasn't a healthy relationship. I broke up with him and left. I felt better, but somehow those thoughts that was instilled in me that you are lying if you are trans was still in my head. Not in a way that is mean towards trans people, but in a way that makes me scared to think that I am trans. 

It also doesn't really help that since I am autistic, I never understood gender roles in society anyway. So I have always come off as weird, and acted in a non-feminine way (I am AFAB). But I am passionate about feminine fashion. I also have always loved the idea of male fashion too, but I just felt like I look too top heavy and made me feel uncomfortable wearing those clothes because it doesn't feel like I have the right body for it. I never got to explore it properly because of my anxiety and lack of confidence. I am planning to invest in a binder too to see if this could fix this. 

The best way to describe the way I feel is that ""I simply do not vibe with gender and I would rather be a bread."" if that makes sense. 

Then, I decided to cut my hair super short. At work, a customer referred to me as 'they', I don't know why but it made me so happy, I remember my hands being cold and clammy and my heart was beating hard. I think it was excitement. 

Now the question is, I feel like I might be nonbinary/genderqueer, because I just do not vibe with genders in general, and I just do whatever the heck with myself and never cared much. But also, I am AFAB and I do enjoy feminine things such as makeup and skirts and dresses. Does that make me not nonbinary? Or do I think that I cannot be nonbinary because I also enjoy feminine things because of the unhealthy ideas that are instilled in me? I personally have never met a nonbinary person who also enjoys feminine things while being AFAB. And I find it hard to feel validated or even real. I dunno. These feelings have been making me want to yeet myself into the depths of the ocean, and be an oyster. 

Thanks for reading btw, I apologize if this is hard to read.

I also have always loved the idea of male fashion too, but I just felt like I look too top heavy and made me feel uncomfortable wearing those clothes because it doesn\'t feel like I have the right body for it. I never got to explore it properly because of my anxiety and lack of confidence. I am planning to invest in a binder too to see if this could fix this. \n\nThe best way to describe the way I feel is that ""I simply do not vibe with gender and I would rather be a bread."" if that makes sense. \n\nThen, I decided to cut my hair super short. At work, a customer referred to me as \'they\', I don\'t know why but it made me so happy, I remember my hands being cold and clammy and my heart was beating hard. I think it was excitement. \n\nNow the question is, I feel like I might be nonbinary/genderqueer, because I just do not vibe with genders in general, and I just do whatever the heck with myself and never cared much. But also, I am AFAB and I do enjoy feminine things such as makeup and skirts and dresses. Does that make me not nonbinary? Or do I think that I cannot be nonbinary because I also enjoy feminine things because of the unhealthy ideas that are instilled in me? I personally have never met a nonbinary person who also enjoys feminine things while being AFAB. And I find it hard to feel validated or even real. I dunno. These feelings have been making me want to yeet myself into the depths of the ocean, and be an oyster. \n\nThanks for reading btw, I apologize if this is hard to read.\n\nTL;DR unsure if I am trans because of the thoughts that society and people around me in the past has instilled on me\n\nEDIT: Added TLDR', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Am I non-binary?', 'created': 1614494117.0}"
