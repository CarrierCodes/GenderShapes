So I’m a non binary genderqueer person (they/them), and I’m working right now to convert to like mostly gender neutral language. 
I use the words “brah” and “bro” all the time, like to refer to people and also as expressions of like frustration and stuff. I’m wondering if there is a word that I can use in place of this that kind of works similarly? 
I like the word “bestie” like “hey bestie” but I’m struggling to find a word that really feels as kind of neutral to me as “bro.” Also, I can’t really use “bestie” with random people I meet, whereas bro is more flexible.

I’ve been supportive of him since he came out, and I’m very vocal about societal issues etc so me talking about specific lgbtq+ issues shouldn’t come as a surprise to them at this point. but he comes to me and just says “are you non binary” and because I’m not ready to come out I frantically say no and then he even goes on to ask if I’m sure with a look that’s like “I know you’re lying” and his voice is almost playful but serious. I again frantically say no and then look the other way because I was close to tears. I ask why and he says him and my mom had been discussing it and she thinks I am. 

I’m so hurt. I’m crying whilst writing this and it’s been a while since that happened. I’m hurt because he just asks me in front of my mom and when I say no, he pushes more even though he can clearly see I’m very uncomfortable and nervous. and I’m also hurt because my mom and him discussed my gender identity behind my back. I would have never said to my mom that I think he is trans if he isn’t out. I feel so betrayed and hurt, especially to think that because he’s trans he would understand and not just blatantly ask me. I was even going to come out to him because I felt comfortable as he is trans but now I’ve just been pushed back further. what’s more is that our dad knew he is trans, but he never said anything to any one because he knew that would be disrespectful, and when my brother came out and he told him he knew, he was thankful he didn’t say anything.

2021-01-01 18:31:58,kog8t8,8,1,"Hi everyone. I want to start by saying that I don't personally have any friends or family who are NB so I have no one to ask and I don't think google will be very helpful to me.

My question: If you're a NB parent what do you refer to yourself as? I guess my example would be instead of saying to your child ""One moment, mommy/daddy is busy"" what would you replace mommy/daddy with? Or do you replace it at all?

I have a friend who has a cousin who is with someone who decided they are now NB after getting pregnant and having a baby but they still refer to themselves as mommy. However they are very, very, aggressive when people even remotely mess up and refer to them as any form of female terminology. In order to better understand NB and gender fluid people and make sure I am properly informed, I just want to know if that is normal? To be aggressive but then continue referring to yourself as a gendered name for a parent. 

I am really hoping nothing I wrote is offensive. I really just want to receive some education and be properly informed. I have a child myself and would like to properly educate them eventually in turn when they are at the appropriate age for it. And please please if I did say anything offensive let me know what it is so I can correct myself.

My [transphobic uncle](https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/knauzb/my_transphobic_uncle_gave_me_a_phone_call/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) called me in the afternoon and like before we talked about various things. Eventuatlly he and my aunt (she was on the phone with us, presumably in a car) eventually brought up the LGBTQ community like before, and things were not good. He not only called this beloved community ""strange,"" but also demonic and against the ways of God. He even gone as far as to say, ""YOUR SCREWED UO IN THE HEAD!!! YOU NEED TO FIND A CHRISTIAN THERAPIST TO TALK TO!!!!"" 

As you can imagine I wasn't pleased by what they had to say. I told them about a gay Christian friend I met at college and this guy told me that homosexuality was added in the Bible during the 50s. I explained this to my aunt and uncle. They were baffled and said that they will only follow what the Bible says. They do not think my friend is a true Christian because he practices homosexuality. 

They believe that we have been brainwashed. They think we are very strange asked why I should advertise I am queer for wanting to wear slight makeup or something. I argued that straight people advertise it all the time, yet my aunt and uncle believe that it's because it's ""normal"" behavior. They are very concerned about me being queer. They think it's my depression that caused me to be this way. But the current reason im so depressed is because of the way my family has been treating me because I'm asexual and nonbinary. I have been having suicidal thoughts and even attempted suicide multiple times because of it. They claim to love and accept me but to them gender and sexuality is a big red flag for them.

After the phone call I was feeling very bad. I talked to my dad (who really isn't any better than them) about how insecure my relatives were to me. My dad seemed like he really cares for me but in a different way. He is very worried that if I put on make up, take estrogen etc. I wouldn't be able to find a job, I may lose my current job, or have customers or coworkers get uncomfortable around me. He thinks I will undergo an insane amount of discrimination (ironic since my family is very anti LGBTQ) from others. In order to prevent this he believes I should go through conversion therapy. However not like the ones wear they beat and rape victims, but like a supposedly civilized way wear I talk to a christian therapist on how and why I'm uncomfortable with my body, and how the therapist would help me get comfortable in my body and try to accept to me that im a man when I'm an enby.

I argued that straight people advertise it all the time, yet my aunt and uncle believe that it\'s because it\'s ""normal"" behavior. They are very concerned about me being queer. They think it\'s my depression that caused me to be this way. But the current reason im so depressed is because of the way my family has been treating me because I\'m asexual and nonbinary. I have been having suicidal thoughts and even attempted suicide multiple times because of it. They claim to love and accept me but to them gender and sexuality is a big red flag for them.\n\nAfter the phone call I was feeling very bad. I talked to my dad (who really isn\'t any better than them) about how insecure my relatives were to me. My dad seemed like he really cares for me but in a different way. He is very worried that if I put on make up, take estrogen etc. I wouldn\'t be able to find a job, I may lose my current job, or have customers or coworkers get uncomfortable around me. He thinks I will undergo an insane amount of discrimination (ironic since my family is very anti LGBTQ) from others. In order to prevent this he believes I should go through conversion therapy. However not like the ones wear they beat and rape victims, but like a supposedly civilized way wear I talk to a christian therapist on how and why I\'m uncomfortable with my body, and how the therapist would help me get comfortable in my body and try to accept to me that im a man when I\'m an enby. My dad even said that if he was nonbinary or trans he would go through this type of therapy.

I used to have issues with clothing. I would have a hard time dressing myself to go to work or to have a night out. I would put on an outfit, feel uncomfortable, take it off, put on another outfit etc. I had a hard time finding something I liked or was comfortable wearing in stores or online. Getting dressed would sometimes make me anxious and upset. Some nights I would feel too uncomfortable and just give up and stay home.

I recently come out to myself as Non Binary (AFAB).

I started dressing in a more masculine way this summer. I haven’t had any problems dressing myself since then. No more anxiety or discomfort.

Part of what that meant for me was to come out to all of my friends and family.

I managed to fully come out to all of them within the first day of the year!

It was terrible nerve wracking trying all day to find a good time to come out to my family, whom I live with. Despite knowing that they would totally be supportive, I still had these irrational fears that they would think I'm just confused or that they would have a bunch of intrusive questions.

I totally worked myself up for nothing.

I told my family (mom, dad, and sibling) on a car ride home from a little sight seeing trip and they all basically said ""That's awesome! Thanks for telling us. Wow what a cool suprise."" 10000% on board with me! All of my friends basically reacted the same way too! I am beyond privileged to be able to have that kind of reception and I couldn't be happier for it.

The only bad note was my mom being really intrusive asking if I had any boy crushes right away, which I shut down pretty quick. It's annoying, but mom's gotta mom, right? She's just excited for me.

2021-01-02 10:12:03,kov699,6,1,"Hi all! I tried looking for a similar question being asked before but couldn't find it so excuse me if this is something that's already been answered. 

For context, I'm currently organising an online youth camp (on discord) in my country which will happen next week around the theme of identity. We're mostly focusing on ethnic identity (basically how our understanding and society's understanding of ethnicity leads to racism), but of course, we're opening discourse on other parts of identity including gender identity. The kids (15-16 y/o) needed to send a short essay to apply for our camp, which we reviewed to let them in. The goal is to have kids from many backgrounds so we can expose them to new perspectives than what they, but that also means quite a few of them aren't as exposed to the LGBTQ+ related concepts, including gender and all its forms of expressions. Another important piece of information is my country is very heavily anti-LGBT, so for many of these kids, this is either one of their first safe spaces to express themselves or one of the first spaces for them to meet queer teens. 

On to the actual question, we have 2 kids who stated their pronoun as other, so I'm assuming they're non-binary (one goes by she/they pronouns, the other goes by every pronoun).

 I'm keen on ensuring this is a safe space where they feel their identity is respected, so I'd love tips on how to do that, as this is my first time working with genderqueer youth. I've already created pronoun roles in the server, and am planning to norm introducing ourselves with our pronouns. I'll also keep an eye out to ensure the other participants don't misgender/disrespect the two I'm talking about.

Something I'm especially struggling with are ""dorm"" sessions. We noticed that during in person camps, most students tend to feel comfortable in sharing some things with other members of their gender. We wanted to emulate this in an online setting, and I wanted to ask the two NB participants which group they wanted to join, if any, but I'm unsure on how I could go about this question in a sensitive manner.

is 'person' the correct GN version of boy/girl/man/woman? bc i feel like its a little impersonal, but i also feel as if using 'enby' would be a little too informal.  

how common is 'mx' to see in the wild? ive heard it used in trans-friendly circles, but never outside. would it be generally understood by young-ish people as to what i was on about?

this one is probably quite personal, but i'd like others' opinions on it: is 'guys' okay to use in dialogue to refer to a group with the nb character in? i use it colloquially to refer to like, everyone but idk if thats typical or not. i really don't want it to feel like i'm misgendering the character though.

potentially helpful note, my story isn't set in a 100% realistic world. it's a light-hearted comedy and i really don't delve into their identity at all, or any misgendering or enbyphobia.

I know it may be annoying that that gets asked a lot but I wanted to ask something in a somewhat similar vein, but different context. 

I feel that I identify with being nonbinary. I dont like people perceiving me as a female (nor a male) and I feel some discomfort about my secondary sex characteristics. 

Im wondering if this is coming from a ""truly actualized"" or what the fuck ever idea of nonbinary, or if I'm simply wanting to disguise myself so as not to have the unwanted attention of random men, have my body appraised, be lumped in with the traditional idea of what it means to be a woman etc etc. I am very distrustful of men and have zero problem getting in someone's face if they're catcalling me or whatever. I feel like most random Joe's on the street see me as a piece of meat or just some feeble, incompetent woman or whatever. If a random man approaches or tries to talk to me I tense up immediately and prepare my verbal or physical (never gotten there lol) reaction. 

I am in therapy, and know this is a result of my sexual assault history and PTSD, but I have mostly worked through the PTSD at this point (relatively, idk you might read this and think different)

At the same time I just feel more like myself with short hair and androgynous clothes, etc. 

In case it's relevant I live with my boyfriend of two years who I adore.

This is just oxymoronic to me. You have a person who expressly says ""I am genderless"" and reporters/writers are basically saying ""yeah sure, but also you're not"".

2021-01-03 16:02:50,kpn10y,4,1,"Me M 20.  Her F 23
My ex and I got into it nearly 2 years ago. She beat me up pretty good left a gash across my chest, bite marks and bruises, she had like 2 bruises from me trying to get her off of me. We both have pictures of the abuse. My mom tried reporting her to my ""mandated reporter"" social worker WHEN IT HAPPENED who did nothing about it. She also has video of another time when she was beating me up and I also tried to push her off of me and pin her and I was screaming at her, but obviously the video is cut to only where I start dominating the fight. The videos delete after so long, so she must've recorded on her phone from where I start getting her off of me. So the police cannot get the original video most likely unless they talk to the company who does the security footage as the original deleted. 

She reported me for Domestic Violence, Aggravated Assault, DV in the presence of a child, and criminal mischief all felonies, 2-3 weeks ago, and I got arrested and spent Christmas and a little over a week after that in jail before I was able to finally bail out. This all took place about 1.5-2 years ago. Her and I have been broken up for the last 6 months bc she cheated on me. She also filed a protective order, and SIGNED MY DAUGHTERS NAME ON IT😡 idc about her anymore but don't infringe on my relationship with my daughter. 

Couple questions with my new charges
1. Why didn't she report it 2 years ago?    2. Why didn't she report me 6 months ago when we broke up, why wait tell a couple days before Christmas??    3. Would the Aggravated Assault fall off seeing as I didnt have a weapon, and I genuinely believe I was acting in self defense (though the way she cut the videos doesn't make it seem like that)    4. She put she was scared that I would come to her house after being served the protective order which just kept me in jail for longer, how is she scared if she waited almost 2 years to report it?    5. HOW DO I BEST PROCEED WITH HAVING SPENT ALL MY MONEY ON BAIL AND NO LONGER BEING ABLE TO AFFORD A LAWYER? public defender is the best i can do. Is that going to be sufficient to prove my innocence? Especially seeing as the court system favors girls. 

(You know if she reported ME to my social worker instead of my mom on HER 2 years ago that they wouldve taken action) 

Also I was never read my rights when I was arrested.


But I was kinda being dumb at the start and not shutting up bc they were saying they had video and I didnt deny anything which probably doesn't look the best on me, I just took the ride😔 

Also my mom remembers when I was walking into my moms garage and my ex punched me, then when I walked inside I was carrying my daughter inside, and the ex punched me in the dick and my mom told her to knock it off.    6.

I have been assigned female at birth, and while I don't necessarily not identify with this gender, I don't particularly identify with it either. I feel very uncomfortable wearing clothes generally seen as girly, like skirts and dresses, and I feel like I don't fit in with other girls or have interests typically seen as girly.

 On the other hand I tend to be much more interested in things typically seen as ""boyish"" and quite like passing off as one. However, I do not want to be a boy.

  When i first found out what being non-binary meant, I felt really positively about it, and, after I started questioning my gender identity a few days ago, it seemed like it would fit me better than my current one. Furthermore, I really enjoy the idea of not being any of the two traditional genders, because I get to choose the parts I like most about each.

2021-01-04 03:28:25,kq05dv,20,1,"Hey friends. 

I’m a 38yo AFAB and recently realized I’m NB. But I also feel this intense sense of imposter syndrome...like this little voice in my head saying “dude, you’ve been watching too many Tiktoks”.

Context: I’ve always known I wasn’t “like the other girls”. At 11 I told my mom (Polish catholic) that I was attracted to women and she promptly said it was a “disease” I’d grow out of and started dressing me in wool and lace Laura Ashley dresses. My mom was an abusive, alcoholic narcissist but the only time I ever stood up to her was when I had finally had enough of the dresses and threw a fit.

For me growing up “lesbian”, I was mostly exposed to either butch or femmes. But I really never found my place in either presentation. Sometimes I like to let down my long hair and prance around in my Victoria secret Brazilians, but other times I relish being called sir at the grocery store.

At uni, I was a big fan of Judith Butler and gained an understanding of gender as a social construct and performance. It was the first time I felt that I was getting closer to something deep inside of me.

Recently I’ve started reading more about the non-binary experience and it just feels like it clicks....like it’s that missing puzzle piece. When I experiment using they/them or even he/they pronouns I get a distinct feeling of excitement and joy. It just feels like YES.

In the past, I understood the non-binary identity was one ONLY for androgynous people. But recently I have come to understand that it truly is about fluidity. a beautiful analogy I heard on Tiktok was that gender is like murmuring birds....which made me weep. This is exactly the feeling I’ve always had.

But, you know, I’m 38 and part of me is like “you’re just having a midlife crisis”, “you just want to stay relevant, you old fart”. 

I guess I’m reaching out here for some support to help me quell those voices, that insidious imposter syndrome that makes me so nervous to finally wear my identity with pride.

On that note, how do yʻall talk about yourselves/other enbies in gendered languages? This question is mostly for my Spanish, Portuguese, and Mandarin speaking enbies bc those are the languages Iʻm learning.

Personally in Spanish if Iʻm talking about my nb friends Iʻll say *elle* for the nominative (e.g. *tendrás que hablar con elle* for youʻll have to talk to them), *li(s)* for the accusative (e.g. *yo li(s) amaba* for I loved them), and *une(s)* for the indefinte article (e.g. *unes maestres* for some teachers). Iʻm pretty sure those are relatively standard, but Iʻve been using *il* and *iles/les* for the definte article (e.g. *il(es) niñes* or *les niñes* for the children) and I know that's not half as standard. Pretty much the same deal for Portuguese but I don't know the accepted pronouns for any part of the sentence.

For Mandarin it's a different problem: how do you write the right character? Bc we can't easily make new ones (CURSE YOU ZHOU HOUKUN) we're pretty much stuck with 他 (masculine) 她 (feminine) 它 (neuter) 祂 (deïties) and 牠 (animals) for the third person singular pronouns. It's not a problem in spoken Mandarin as they're all pronounced *tā* but in written mandarin it's annoying when I'm trying to describe someone and there's no good way to do it. For now I'm using 祂 (for deïties) but I'm curious to know how y'all do it.

Again, not looking to overrule anything that's established within the community; I'm just trying to get more educated.

Hello, I am Asher, just call me Ash, 13 years old. Afab.

So,, I have been questioning this for multiple months. I always knew I was LGBT, but never exactly knew where. I used to think I was a lesbian, then pansexual, then lesbian again, then ace, and now I just stick to Demisexual. But that's besides the point. My gender identity. I always wore male or androgynous clothing, but sometimes wore things considered feminine. This year, being stuck inside is what made me question if I am cis or not. At first I thought I was trans, FtM, and I went by he/him pronouns, but after a lot of thinking, because I knew I wanted the body parts of a male and wanted to dress feminine, I might be non-binary. I know go by they/them pronouns. But I have been having doubts. Sometimes I completely forget I'm Non-Binary, or think I am. I have no problem with people misgendering me as female or calling me my dead name (My name right now is Ash). I want to do super girly things sometimes and be feminine. Wear more feminine clothing. I also don't feel dysphoria at all with my body, though I hate how I look, but that's just in general. I think about myself with female genitalia all the time, and even masturbate, but it has me questioning if I am Enby. If I'm not, what would I be?

2021-01-05 01:10:52,kqmxfz,0,1,"I've literally been thinking about what to write/tell y'all for about 3 or 4 days, so bear with me on this rant... or not.

I'm amab btw, finding my non binary identity rn.

Not very active in Reddit, in fact, not active at all, maybe too old for it; I'm a 35 years old Argentinian person, I've been thinking about my identity for about a year; around September/October last year I decided to ""come out"" to her and start trying different pronouns and what not.

So I started with ""elle/le"" (they/them equivalent but neopronouns in Spanish) by the way f\*\*k Spanish, everything has a gender, pronouns, names, adjectives, etc... So I instantly felt more comfortable, also tried feminine pronouns it was better than masculine ones, but not that much, I guess the comfortable part was that they weren't masculine.

at the beginning of December I started coming out to friends, testing the waters ""I'm thinking about this"" or ""I'm suspecting I'm not a man"" and it was kinda ok, I ""came out"" to my mother, and that was awkward but ok, like it was all about ""your generation has this possibilities"" ""everything is so different now"" ""my generation opened the road for yours"" and it really feels kinda gas-lighting, she's not denying it, just is not a thing that happens to me/her/us, it happens to a whole generation, and we are supposed to be grateful? F\*\*k that, she and my orangutan of a father raised me denying my expressions and I grew up as a ""sensitive"" boy who cried a lot, and never played with a lot of boys, preferred to read/write or watch cartoons... cartoons were I always ""liked"" (I wanted to be) Sailor Jupiter or Xena or Priss, you get the drill, big strong lesbians... I didn't want football or tae kwon do I wanted dancing and acrobatic gym... so yeah, I grew up forgetting all that, and now I'm 35 years old, and I have a lot of questions and/or doubts.

Oh! BTW at the beginning of everything I started investigating and reading and for a moment I was so lost, everything was politics and history and such, but then I talked with a friend and they told me to spot studying, first of all it was about my experience and my feelings, so I retook my own way...

And then, the ""hard"" part I am a semi-public person, I teach at 3 universities and work for a local foundation/ONG, so people in the industry I'm involved with follow me on social media and I have done some works as a consultant and such. One of the institutions I teach at is quite conservative, mostly because the directives are old af and scared of what the conservative students (the big part of the revenue of the campus) can think about gender related discussions, I teach a philosophy class and had to change some parts of the program because reasons.

the first 2 or 3 times I told a someone I cried, I've been quite sensitive, I had learnt how not to cry so much... and let me tell you I was so behind my due tears, everything's been so freeing I think I'm crying from ""happiness"" for the first time in my life.

I don't think I have dysphoria per se... not sure what dysphoria is, but I recognize some situations where I'm not completely comfortable with how my body works/feels/is; like after adult fun times I get ""confused"" and I never really liked my face in the mirror, but that's not new.

Now, tips, tricks and insights (?)

1. Not related, but AMABs out there, peeing siting down is the best.
2. F\*\*k clothes with no pockets, I want to use more ""women's"" jeans.
3. you do you and f\*\*k everyone else's opinion.
4. I still ask myself Am I faking it? am I too old? who am I really? is it all politics?
5. For all Spanish speakers out there, please be aware that the ""X"" and the ""@"" are not the best option for inclusive language, they create a lot of problems for screen readers and dyslexics, so try to use the ""E"" also, the E and the inclusive language is supported by linguistics and such; and for words were ""E"" is the masculine normative, you can use ""I"" if you see fit, so: Pibes, Pibas, Pibis (dudes, dudettes, thudes), cómodo, cómoda, cómode (comfortable... Yay gendered adjectives).

BTW at the beginning of everything I started investigating and reading and for a moment I was so lost, everything was politics and history and such, but then I talked with a friend and they told me to spot studying, first of all it was about my experience and my feelings, so I retook my own way...\n\nAnd then, the ""hard"" part I am a semi-public person, I teach at 3 universities and work for a local foundation/ONG, so people in the industry I\'m involved with follow me on social media and I have done some works as a consultant and such. One of the institutions I teach at is quite conservative, mostly because the directives are old af and scared of what the conservative students (the big part of the revenue of the campus) can think about gender related discussions, I teach a philosophy class and had to change some parts of the program because reasons.\n\nthe first 2 or 3 times I told a someone I cried, I\'ve been quite sensitive, I had learnt how not to cry so much... and let me tell you I was so behind my due tears, everything\'s been so freeing I think I\'m crying from ""happiness"" for the first time in my life.\n\nI don\'t think I have dysphoria per se... not sure what dysphoria is, but I recognize some situations where I\'m not completely comfortable with how my body works/feels/is; like after adult fun times I get ""confused"" and I never really liked my face in the mirror, but that\'s not new.\n\nNow, tips, tricks and insights (?)\n\n1. Not related, but AMABs out there, peeing siting down is the best.\n2. F\\*\\*k clothes with no pockets, I want to use more ""women\'s"" jeans.\n3. you do you and f\\*\\*k everyone else\'s opinion.\n4. I still ask myself Am I faking it? am I too old? who am I really? is it all politics?\n5. For all Spanish speakers out there, please be aware that the ""X"" and the ""@"" are not the best option for inclusive language, they create a lot of problems for screen readers and dyslexics, so try to use the ""E"" also, the E and the inclusive language is supported by linguistics and such; and for words were ""E"" is the masculine normative, you can use ""I"" if you see fit, so: Pibes, Pibas, Pibis (dudes, dudettes, thudes), cómodo, cómoda, cómode (comfortable... Yay gendered adjectives).\n6.

Several years ago I identified as non-binary, used he/they for awhile. Eventually this began to fill ill-fitting, and I related heavily to being a woman, and still do. I went back to she/her and said I considered myself a woman. I've always been a tad gender nonconforming, depending how you define it, (gender roles and my relation to them and such).

But a big part of me just really wants to use they/them... but I am so afraid of what everyone will think of me.

And, I know this is a very toxic way of thinking, but I am even afraid that if I use they/them pronouns, people will be put off by being romantically interested in me.

I know that my family would never understand what non binary is, and would never use they/them pronouns. 

I know that most of my teachers wouldn’t use my pronouns. 

And I especially know that nobody in my career industry would use them or take me seriously if they found out I use they/them. 


And there is still even a part of me that is scared of the change of using they/them and stopping using she/her... I’m not too sure why. Maybe it feels like apart of who I am will no longer be there anymore?

I was thinking on it and I don't know if this is using the word right so correct me if I'm wrong, but I feel that I have dysphoria towards my inner workings. Not my genitalia, that's kinda just there and doesn't bother me, but the bits like my ovaries and uterus bother me.

The thought of them being in there makes me feel icky, I've felt this way since I started menstruating when I was 11. (Tbh I didn't even think I had those parts until then) Since I was 11 I've felt that part of me isn't really part of me?

2021-01-05 19:28:46,kr5oom,7,1,"Incoming rant... TL:DR at bottom

Idk how to even start this but I guess I've been questioning my gender for a while (I'm amab, 21), but am just too scared to open up to someone about it. That, combined with my unwillingness to be vulnerable with people has been the cause of a lot of pain and struggle for me for a while, and I just need to get all of it off my chest and talk with people who understand and won't judge me. Living in Texas has made it that much harder, I've literally never talked with anyone about gender ever.

Let me start off by saying I HATE toxic masculinity, I have no desire to be masculine or dominant, it just all feels so fake and like everyone guy is in some grand competition to see who can beat their chest the hardest and the loudest. It's just not me at all, I'm a caring, loving, sensitive guy and hate that I feel like I have to hide it. There are some male gender norms I feel fine with, but others I just don't identify with at all. I haven't talked with any of my friends or family about this because I just hate feeling like a burden. I'm such a people pleaser and hate the feeling of conflict, and hate the idea that some people just straight up won't like me because I'm being honest with myself. As a result I feel as though I've internalized a lot of these struggles and done some things I'm extremely ashamed of...

This is where it gets really hard for me to open up, and I feel like I'll neveerrr be able to tell anyone I know in real life about this. I'm very sexually submissive, and because I'm not able to open up to anyone about this (as I'm scared of conflict and being seen as not masculine), I've been very lonely recently. As a result I've gone and gotten myself addicted to financial domination. If you don't know what it is, essentially I've thrown away thousands of my own hard earned dollars towards girls that literally just bully me and take advantage of me at my most vulnerable points. I'm so ashamed and disappointed in myself because of it and just feel so trapped with no way out. And to make me feel worse is that I know I'm a catch, like I'm an attractive, smart, funny sensitive guy that I know a lot of people would be happy to date, I've just been too scared/socially anxious/introverted to ever go for it.

So that's why I've come here, I don't know if I'm non-binary, I feel like gender non-conforming is a better label?? Idk. But I just need some advice or maybe just some people to talk to because I need to get out this rut and I have got to stop sending money to people who don't give a shit about me. There are some people at my college who are openly gender fluid that I'm mutuals with on Twitter lol, I've thought about reaching out to them to start to build friendships with like-minded people, it's still just scary and idk if that's the best place to start. Thanks for reading if you made it this far, any and all help would be greatly appreciated.

    Though I'm AFAB, I've recently started identifying as a nonbinary person, specifically demigender, as I feel I'm partially connected to femininity and enjoy presenting feminine , but feel more like a ""consciousness"", just a person. At the time I did not have a dissatisfaction with my body, other than the occasional episode of hating my weight and curves, which i figured was not related to gender. I chose to identify as a demigirl because I relate to no gender really, and feel like I dont identify with any group. I've never thought of myself as a girl really, just a brain that was put in this body by default, if that makes sense. I dont want to be a man, most definitely not. I dont necessarily feel like I'm agender. I just feel like this third gender that doesnt exist, which i know sounds weird and may be hard to relate to.
     Androgyny (I havent tried a lot of androgyny, I plan on cutting my hair short and thats about it) seems like it might be too masculine for me. I actually enjoy presenting femininely, and I know I dont owe androgyny to anybody.
I just keep having this feeling of ""somethings not right. Somethings uncomfortable"". I feel like this cant be fixed because I have no wish to become the opposite gender. I became uncomfortable with my breasts at one point tonite and put on a sports bra and that seemed to help, but im not sure if im ashamed of my breasts because I simply don't like them, or if its related to weight, or in fact it is my gender. 
     I've never explored much with gender before and presenting in different ways. As someone else online in an article described it, ""i feel like a side character in my own story"". I have this constant feeling of not being able to match how I feel on the inside, and no matter if I dress a certain way, or talk a certain way, nothing feels right, because I'm not sure what goal I have in mind. He,they,she, nothing sounds right. Its been causing me extreme distress. Is this dysphoria?
     I'm not sure if I should try out being more androgynous or not. I just feel like people will think im a flat chested woman or something. I feel this pressure to be eye candy for other people and its not comfortable. But I dont know how to BE comfortable in my skin.
     I know its long and confusing, but any advice you have would be helpful. Thank you guys.

I have a very large chest and small waist. My binder compresses my chest a lot (it’s not super flat but that’s another issue), but there’s so much extra room in the waist that my boobs basically fall out of it if I move wrong. They do NOT stay in the same place. Is that normal? 

I’ve watched videos and read how to put it on, but I don’t really know how tight it’s supposed to fit.

I don’t think I could go down more than one size without it crushing me, and I’m worried about spending more money on another binder just to have the same issue. Even with the size I bought (XL) my breast tissue pops out the arm holes if I pull them all the way up.

2021-01-06 13:58:40,kroclc,10,1,"Far as I know, my parents think I'm either closeted lesbian or closeted trans guy. In reality, I'm aroace and questioning nb. Since I moved out and had my own place, I became more confident exploring things such as my style and behavior and who I actually am. I represented way more feminine when I lived at my parents place, not necessarily because they denied me doing otherwise, but I was simply aphatic towards myself and didn't even think there would be a way I'd feel any kind of connection with my appearance, so I didn't know why to try anyway. I just did what I was expected since it was the easiest socially and I didn't have to face the difficult feelings I had towards myself. 

Anyhow, nowadays I represent pretty androgynous/sporty, cut my hair short-ish (still a huge difference compared to my past appearance), don't wear makeup, practically avoid anything that can be seen exclusively feminine. I feel a lot more in touch with myself, and I'm even capable of being genuinely internally happy with my reflection occasionally. I feel like there's a lot less contradiction between my appearance and inner self,  I feel more confident and content nowadays.

However, there's something that makes me feel uncomfortable. Practically my whole life, my mum have been the most feminine woman I've ever known. She wears the pastels and laces, always has some pins and stuff on her hair, she loves to wear makeup, and her mannerism is very feminine. She has ""the women's worries"" such as her weight and shapes and stuff. She always talks about ""us ladies"" and likes to emphasize her womanhood. Until recently, when she noticed I've changed my style. She have started to buy noticeably less feminine clothes, she jokes about who of us two has more masculine style, and she also seems to act more masculine in a way that just feels very pushy to me, knowing her for over two decades. I can tell any of it doesn't come naturally to her, yet she pushes it to ""vibe"" with me or something. Whenever any stereotypically masculine trait of mine from the past comes into discussion, she rushes to say something like ""yeah, some _women_ are more masculine, but it doesn't make them men"" or ""you're a strong independent _woman""_ or something. 

I've tried to make it clear that me exploring my expression does not mean I looked down on feminine style or people who preferred it. I've tried to make it clear that being emotional and nurturing and ""tidy"" are positive traits in her and in people in generall, even if I couldn't relate to those traits myself. I've tried to tell my mum that this is my personal journey I have to make, am ready to make and want to make, by myself. But it feels like she ignores all of that and reduces it to a mere competition of ""which one of us can better do this new trendy tomboy thing"". 

I don't need ""a new hip mum"", I just need one who can accept me and see me as an individual. I feel really bad for feeling this way, I feel like she's really trying her best but she's going about it all the wrong way. I feel like by mimicing me, she prevents me to be seen as an individual, she makes my attemp to finally express what I've so long felt inside, empty, I feel like she's trying to mute me. 

I don't know what to do. It's stupid but this single thing makes me so frustrated any time I meet her. I want to try to be understanding, like she's probably having a traumatic experience seeing me change. But I feel I'm just too tired to see her side. Has any of you went trough similar experiences?

2021-01-06 17:52:55,krt2xf,0,1,"Hello! This is my first post in this group so sorry if I break any rules. I just wanted to share my excitement and hopefully start a dialogue with others. 

I’ve wanted a breast reduction ever since I became aware of my chest and realized in 2019 that it was partially related to gender dysphoria. I rarely see discussion of non binary people getting breast reductions so I always questioned my reasoning and was worried only top surgery would be covered by my insurance. I finally spoke with a gender therapist at Kaiser yesterday who was extremely affirming and I was so happy to find out that they can cover a breast reduction for gender affirmation! 

We also talked about coming out to my parents. We have a good relationship and they are generally accepting of me and my decisions. I’ve been hesitant to share this part of my identity with them because I don’t want to add a burden to their lives...I realize how codependent this is and am struggling with it.

So I bought an Underworks Binder ([https://www.amazon.co.uk/Underworks-Extreme-Tri-Top-Chest-Binder/dp/B004SPU4L8?th=1&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Underworks-Extreme-Tri-Top-Chest-Binder/dp/B004SPU4L8?th=1&amp;psc=1)) here. According to the measurements I should be on the smaller end of large. It came today and it compresses my breasts (which is great!) but there's tons of empty space under it. The gap underneath in between my compressed breasts and my stomach is enough to fit two hands in with the palms on top of one another. It's also super easy to get on and off, which makes me think it's too big.

As I have large breasts it's hard to figure out whether this is how binders fit on people with my frame.

Chest Measurements:

Underarm Measurement- 89cm, 35 inches

Largest part of the chest: 96cm, 37.7 inches

Under-bust measurement: 74cm, 29 inches

Shoulder Measurements:

Point to point: 39cm, 15.4 inches

I'm still figuring things out, so would appreciate some advice. Thanks!

I honestly had no clue about the controversy surrounding it before making my purchase, and I was head over heels for the game. It was right up my alley: cute, pixelated, steeped in Japanese and Chinese culture, even hints of LGBT positivity, not to mention a relaxing atmosphere and a kick ass OST.

All the good vibes I had gotten from playing the game have completely reversed, and now I feel fucking sick. I legit feel like crying, and that was after feeling like nothing could ruin my evening.

And the fact that this happens often enough. When a creator I respect, when the people behind a work of art I love, would never have the decency to see me as who I am, as a fucking human being, and even as someone who just wants to live in peace.

2021-01-07 01:48:19,ks2qh8,7,4,"i’m 13 years old and have only known i’m nonbinary since the start of september last year. part of that is probably due to the fact that i was completely sheltered from the lgbtq+ community by my dad until i discovered it at the start of lockdown last year. but that’s besides the point.

my chest makes me really sad and frustrated, and i’m not sure if what i feel is dysphoria since i hate it, but it’s less like a strong hatred than like a dark cloud swirling over me and ruining my mood. every time i’m comfy and suddenly feel my chest, i feel really grossed out and have to hold something close to me and pretend i just felt my shirt brush against the blanket.

i would really like a binder but my parents would notice that i have one, and i’m not ready to come out yet. i want one, and don’t really know how much longer i can go on like this. it really drags down my life and i end up snapping at my mum from the redirected anger, which is really unfair on both of us but especially her.

i don’t doubt my feelings, but i just feel silly since so many people go YEARS with dysphoria and i’m thinking of getting a binder already. i know i shouldn’t judge my trans-ness on how much dysphoria i have, but it still makes me feel like i’m a bit of a weak trans person for not braving through it for as long as they had to.

My friends are totally fine with it (a lot of them are also queer anyway), and so is my sister, but my parents are... struggling to come to terms with it, and my mum especially is quite upset about it all, but I think she's trying to understand... and my friends so far are the only ones who have actually been using they/them for me, but right now I'm ok with that, I honestly don't know if my family will ever get to that point...

Anyway, the point of this post is that I'm thinkinggg of changing my name (just my first name), but I'm really not sure about it for a few reasons, and I just wanted to see if anyone had any advice about it all I guess?? My birthname is Rachael, and I've felt a little off about my name for as long as I can remember tbh, and have always kind of fantasised about changing it, asking people what other names they would give me or what they'd name me if I was a boy etc. But at the same time... I do like it?? Like, I'm fond of it, it's *my* name, it's special to me. I especially like the kind of unique spelling of it with the added ""a"", because although it's annoying that people always get it wrong, I'm kind of fond of that at this point too you know? But it's just... so feminine... like no one would ever see/hear the name Rachael and think of anyone other than a woman, and that makes me uncomfortable tbh, because I'm just not a woman... I personally don't really see it as that womanly/feminine, but I think that's because it's my name and I've never seen myself as womanly/a woman, if that makes sense? Like if people were to commonly view it as not exclusively a woman's name then I don't think I'd have a problem with it, but unfornuately they do... There's also the issue that my parents really don't want me to change my name, and my mom even started crying when  I just suggested having a slightly more gender neutral nickname (like not a different name, just a nickname), and I really don't want to upset them... Like, they chose my name and now I'm trying to change that, idk I feel bad about it... But ahh yeah... 

I've thought about just going by ""Rach"" as a nickname because my family and some friends have called me that all my life so it makes sense and I am fond of that too, and to me it seems quite neutral, but I guess it's not actually neutral and idk if anyone else would ever really see it that way... do you think it sounds gender neutral...?? If anyone does have any other gender neutral nicknames for Rachael that'd be great!! The only other nickname I've looked at is Rae, but I'm not sure how I feel about that tbh like I'm not sure it suits me, plus that's the nickname that made my mum cry when I very casually brought it up soo yeah... :(

I also have no idea what name I would choose if I were to change it completely, even though I've spent years thinking about what I'd change it to if I could... I like the idea of having a neutral name that's similar to Rachael but none of the ones I've seen so far really fit, and I guess it's not the end of the world if it's totally different... I also like the idea of having a Christian/Biblical name too, because I'm Christian and Rachael is also Biblical, so I'd really like that... so umm if anyone has any name ideas that fit or fit somewhere around these criteria that'd be helpful too??

Anyhoo this got long wow haha, I really appreciate it if you've read this far and thank you so much in advance to anyone that gives advice, name or nickname ideas etc. :) I truly hope you have a wonderful day !! xx",NonBinary,changing my name...??,1610061078.0,"{'created_utc': 1610035878, 'id': 'ksgdp1', 'num_comments': 8, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Hi!! :) So to give you some context here, after quite a few years of questioning and a lottt of emotions and confusion, over these past couple of months I\'v realised I\'m nonbinary!!

2021-01-07 22:07:16,kso397,4,2,"Hello everyone! 

I hope I can talk about this here.

Long story short: I just joined reddit a few weeks back to share my journey to self-love also through erotism. For this particular purpose, I wanted to share some nsfw here and there, but I am (I shouldn't, but still) surprised that most of the nsfw subreddits aren't welcoming at all to the enby community: most of them ask for ""women"", ""females"" or ""men"" and ""males"", some of them ask for Trans people to label themselves with a generic ""\[T\]"".

I feel really good that there are many nsfw subreddits created specifically for enbys or queers, but... I am really astonished that, for example, the subreddit ""*fishnets*"" (like, stockings) is **only** for women. 

I hope I am not breaking any rule here but... I am very new and I don't really have connections, neither I know how to do stuff in here or if this is only perceived by me, so I have a question: should we create more nsfw subreddits for the enby community?

I also had a ""not like other girls"" attitude for most of my childhood up until I started high school since I started to think about others in a less patronizing way lmao. I also used to wish I was born as a guy when I was younger for two reasons and I'm not sure if this is relevant to anything: 1. I wanted to date girls and didn't know being gay was a thing and 2. I hated that I would have to suffer through periods for a good portion of my life.

I have previously considered myself to be gender non-conforming since I don't like conforming to the standards placed upon women. For example, I don't like wearing feminine things, I prefer a more neutral or androgynous gender expression. However, I'm not sure if this term is right for me and if this a gender issue rather than just a clothing preference.

I thought of some questions relating to me and things associated with gender since I do not know what classifies as dysphoria. I got some inspiration from some online quizzes but I explain my answers to get opinions on what my identity may be:

* Would I be okay with bigger tits? No, I would rather have no tits than bigger tits and I lowkey want smaller tits already.
* Would I want more noticeable curves? God no, I hate showing the curves I have. There are a few days where I can tolerate knowing I have them though. Otherwise, thinking about them makes me uncomfortable, which then makes me expand my ribs to minimize them.
* Would I want a dick? Ehh, I'm fine with what I have but periods are really annoying. I do think about what if would be like to have one somewhat often but I don't think this is a bottom dysphoria thing.
* Am I okay with being called a woman? No, this makes me uncomfortable and same with ""daughter,"" but I am somewhat okay with ""girl"" for some reason.
* Am I okay with being called a man? Yeah but only in a ""hey man!"" greeting kind of way. I'll understand if someone calls me a man from just looking at me but I'm not seeking for people to call me a man if they know me.
* Am I okay with being referred to only with neutral terms (adult instead of woman)? Yes, it doesn't make me uncomfy like ""woman"" does.
* Am I okay with they/them pronouns? Yes, I view they/them pronouns as what you would use for a person unless specified otherwise and last time I checked, I am in fact a person so they/them fits. 
* Am I okay with she/her pronouns? I think I like they/them better but I'm indifferent towards she/her. I'm kinda indifferent towards both I guess but I definitely don't like he/him.

When I think of myself, I've been noticing that I often just call myself a person instead of using specific gendered language.

These time are harder and harder. I have a appetite loss and  I'm insomniac so I'm just randomly blacking out sometimes and I don't have any memories when I'm ""waking up"", sometime the whole day or the hour before and I need to ask people. 

And, I'm almost totally closeted and waiting for a binder I'm supposed to have soon in secret so it's painful to hear everyone calling my by my agab. I know I can't do anything cause I don't think that's safe especially with my mother, conspiracy type, you know, anti vaccine and stuff, but that's still difficult to hear. I try to ask them discreetly to use more neutral term but eh.

2021-01-08 08:02:57,ksy3rd,13,1,"Hi! Sorry, this is incredibly confusing and hard for me, and I don't know how to talk about it with anyone else so here I am. I will be incredibly thankful for any input on this.

First of all, I am an afab with some internalized misogyny still. I used to be more misogynistic because I never got along with other girls. I was always nonemotional, I never cared about looks and celebrities (mind you, not that there are no girls who also are like this but I'm talking about my own experiences). Now, I know it doesn't matter but I still struggle with showing any feminine (or emotional) interests.

I don't mind being afab. I don't mind my body at all. When I was younger, I hated my breasts, now I do still want binders sometimes. But I like the aesthetic of being small and curvy. I wouldn't wish any other genitals. But I also don't care about being chubbier or having a bigger nose - which is to say, I don't mind my body. I don't love it but I do accept it. I genuinely think of my body just being a secondary thing to my brain and I do not worry myself about the things I can't change. So no dice about understanding myself better here. I also don't care about the ""gender"" of clothes as long as I like them.

I keep thinking, why am I so uncomfortable with really being labeled as ""she"" when eating people irl? I don't like being called a woman, a sister, I'm partially uncomfortable with it. But I don't want to be confused to be a man, though I also don't know why. Is it just my gender identity, or is it just the fact that I was raised to believe that a ""woman looking like a man"" is inherently ugly? 

I also hate my name, which is feminine. But I don't mind my friends calling me masculine nicknames. I wish it sounded different but I don't know why.

When I was younger, I used to pretend that I was a boy online. Now I just avoid using any gender pronouns to myself and let others assign those to me. I'm not uncomfortable when I'm being called a ""he"" online. I don't care when I'm being called ""they"" or ""she"" based on my speech patterns, or a person's believes or whatever.

I was thinking about it for months - whenever I just don't like that we assign inherent meaning and characteristics to gender, or the gender itself. Moreover, I just... Don't feel like gender matters at all and don't care about it, and the social construct of gender. I am just a human, not a she, not a he. 

I want to say, isn't not fitting/believing in a gender construct being agender on itself? But I don't know if I would be disrespectful by it. And again, I don't have (such?) dysphoria associated with being afab so I feel it's kind of disrespectful to assign the ""nonbinary"" gender to myself whilst there are people who feel... More valid than me I guess.

2021-01-08 17:29:18,kt76lg,8,1,"Hi, so this is me being confused lol.

Im AFAB and its true that im more masculin than fem but when i was smalller i didnt give it any thought because i didnt care but when i realized i was part of the lgtb+ community i started to investigate more about gender identitys because it was interesting to me. I then started to think i was genderfluid? but that didnt really fit me since i realized i prefer he/him and they/them pronouns. I searched for more info and found the Demiboy/guy tag and i tried that one but that doesnt really feel like me.

I just go by nb for now but i dont feel okay using that since i like he/him pronouns but i dont think im trans?   
Most of the time i dont care what pronouns people use? But like sometimes she/her pronouns make me really uncomfortable and i just wish people would use he/him pronouns.  
My birthname gives somewhat dysphoria so i go by Nova and i feel so much better when people use that name.

But im also scared that i may be faking it without realizing? Idk

&amp;#x200B;

Could you guys tell me some gender that fit with my description? I know that i dont need a tag but i just kinda want to find one that represents me like when i found out i was pansexual it took a huge weight of my shoulders.

2021-01-08 20:59:54,ktbndt,2,2,"I’m an illustrator/artist and have been slowly coming out as non-binary to people close to me over the past year. In December I decided to publicly share my pronouns for the first time by putting them in my insta bio. I had been contemplating for a while how to ‘announce’ it on social media but in the end decided to take a more subtle approach, which feels more comfortable, as it allows me to gradually adjust to being more open about this aspect of myself.

So I simply put ‘they/them’ in my insta bio and referred to myself using they/them in an artist bio I had to write for a collaboration with a clothing print company. The collaboration launched today, and the company also wrote a few sentences about my work - using they/them - and when I read it I felt a wave of happiness come over me, all warm ’n fuzzy :) (which I’m guessing is euphoria)

Though I’ve come out to my family last summer, and am grateful for their overall love and support, they haven’t put much effort in changing their language when referring to me and I haven’t had the gut to correct them. Which is something I will work on this year!

I am a born-female person who has been struggling more and more with feeling distant from that word. Female. Its been at least 3 years now of me consciously having thoughts about gender deviance, and I'm  afraid it's really starting to hit it's peak for me. I am becoming upset about how far I feel from something I can call ""home"" in terms of gender, and I just wanted to reach out and see what thoughts other people who have had a similar journey might have about the whole thing.

I have been wanting to go by a more gender-neutral name, Marty, for a few months now. I have been wanting a binder, and even had a dream the other night that I just... taped them down. It felt so freeing, and then I woke up depressed and disappointed. I am going to try and make one using a pattern I bought online, but I can't until I return home (I've been staying with family for a while).

I have also been experiencing gender envy with gay men. I am queer myself, and I have a very loving and supportive partner that I am grateful for. The thing is, though, that I feel like I only relate to feminine or twink-like gay men? And I gender-envy drag queens. I feel more like a gay feminine man that anything related to being female itself. But that seems so confusing and invalidating because of my birth gender. Is it still valid to feel like a non-binary or feminine man being born female? I don't feel 100% in either camp (male or female), and I experience anxiety for not knowing how I feel in it's entirety. In turn, that anxiety is leading to some serious body dysphoria.

I also wanted to say that I am very new to all of this, and I sincerely apologize if anything I've said comes across as tone-deaf or offensive. As someone who grew up in a very conservative, very tiny Midwestern town, I've had to push to learn about any of these communities. I have been gay for a while now, but I don't have much experience with the genderqueer community.

My ex and I just broke up about a week ago, on very good terms, and they told me they’re non-binary while we were hanging out one day.

I am so happy for them and support them 100%, which I why I’m coming here for help instead of asking them directly.

Basically, I’m straight and cis, and because I’ve had sex with this person it’s hard to change their gender from what it was to non-binary in my head. 

It’s hard for me to replace what I already think of them. Like of course I would never purposefully misgender them, but I’m worried it will happen on accident because it’s hard to get into my head. 

When I think about them in my head I automatically use their old pronouns, and I have to correct myself.

And, I have questions for them now because I feel like I don’t even know them. There was a whole side of them that I didn’t know about, and now that I do, I want to know more. 

Is it appropriate for me to ask things I’m wondering about now that there’s this new side of them? For example, is it okay to ask if they like wearing makeup? Or what clothes they like? Just because as a friend I want to know what my friend is into.

So, how do I get over this? Will it go away if I just keep practicing and reiterating that they’re non-binary now? Are there any tricks for changing the image I have of them in my head?
Should I hold back on asking questions about what new interests they have that they might not have told me about?

I'm currently in the process of plotting a book which main characters consist of various kinds of people that kind of save the world (classic, I know, but there is more to it of course ;P).   
One character I imaged to be of the non-binary type. While I want this book to also teach the reader about the different struggles every person goes through and to be open minded and loving, I'm really not sure if what I imagined is okay and non offensive for nonbinary people.   


One situation would be that I would like the main character (from whose POV this story is written) to falsely identify the non binary character as a boy first, only to be later corrected that 'he' is in fact nonbinary. MC would be deeply sorry of course, but also interested to learn more. So from then on, the pronoun in the book would also be changed to they/them. First question - would that situation be acceptable?

Second question - I'm originally german and would also like to write a german version of this story. Unfortunately, I'm really not sure as what to use since we don't really have fitting pronouns? How can I  best proceed in this situation?

I also already saw a lot of threads about life and experiences as a nonbinary person, which I will read with much interest to hopefully built a representable character.   
If you, however, would like to tell me your story or experiences, or just want to talk in general, I would love to hear it! I would love to learn as much as possible. Hit me up in the DMs, I would be happy!

She often makes comments saying, “I won’t kiss you until you shave.” \n\nShe recently made a comment saying that she absolutely hates facial hair and that her dislike of it is, “one of the main reasons that she knew she was gay.” Implying that she only likes people who identify as girls. \n\nHer comments really hurt me and make me feel pretty insecure about transitioning. I understand that the facial hair affects her attraction towards me, but I don’t feel like it’s fair for me to have to shave in seeing that the facial hair helps with my dysphoria and overall confidence. \n\nAm I being too sensitive about the whole thing, or should I address these comments with her? I try to let the comments go and ignore them, but they really do hurt. \n\nThanks for any input!

2021-01-09 12:37:02,ktq7t2,9,1,"Ok so I'm not really sure if any of this makes any sense or not. I've been thinking about my gender for a while now and honestly really confused at this point. I'm kinda tired rn, I've been up all night so I'm really sorry if this is a incoherent mess. I'm gonna be splitting this into two categories, my label and my physique.  


When it comes to labels, I've never really been to bothered by people referring to my as my birthgender (male) and I've never really paid much thought to it. Even now I don't really mind if someone were to refer to me as male but I'm not 100% happy with the term. My parents have always told me I need to be more of man, but I've never really wanted that nor would I like it. They're pretty conservative so it might be just their teachings giving me the wrong idea of what a man is, but I don't like it. I think its too restricting, I've never fulfilled the criteria of being a traditional ""man"" and, now more than ever, embrace my femininity. I just don't like all the connotations of term ""male"" and like the freedom I get, from accepting both sides of me. But at the same time, I know I'm not female, I've never felt that way in my life, I just don't really know what to think right now. 

I'm ok with people referring to me as male but I'm not 100% content with it. I don't really know if it's because a legitimate gender identity or if it's because I've always felt like my parents indirectly invalidate me as man because I'm feminine.

Now, my body. I'm 100% ok with genitals, I've never been uncomfortable with that. What I am comfortable with is the other things that come with being male. Muscle, ""bigness"", hair, etc. I despise all of it, I enjoy being smaller, more feminine looking and I would feel widely uncomfortable otherwise.  I just don't like the image of what a ""man"" is. I am currently ok with my body but I do wish it was more feminine rather than masculine. I also wouldn't really mind what I would wear as long as I like it and it looks good in my opinion, I just can't currently because of my parents. But I'd love to wear clothes that aren't ""for guys"". To summarize, I'm ok with my body but I'm not content with it. I would love to appear more androgynous, and I don't mind how I style myself as long as I'm happy.

Other than there isn't really anything else. There are smaller things like, preferring my middle name to my first name. It just sounds to masculine in my opinion and my middle name is already a neutral name (I absolutely adore my middle and would much rather have just been named that). I also used to ""RP"" a lot when I was younger, as strange as RPs are, I really enjoyed them as a kid and I never had a problem roleplaying as a female character and sometimes enjoyed the role. Playing with my sisters was also never a problem since I didn't care about dolls being ""girly"". Idk, I just never really thought that toys were gendered and by playing with them I was suddenly a girl.  


All of this has been in the back of my mind for a few months now and I've thinking about it pretty heavily this week in particular. I've basically been up all night questioning whether what I feel is really valid or if I'm just making this up to make myself feel better somehow.

So I kind of felt not-cis for a lot of my teenage years and basically all adulthood. I even thought I might be a trans woman, and I actually ""dressed myself"" in that identity for a couple of times, but I ultimately decided that I won't transition, because I lack the energy, support, and the most important thing - money.

But I have so much fear about actually taking steps that involve talking to other people. My best friend and partner know I've been questioning and the friend knows I want a binder.

I desperately want to talk to my partner more, especially because he's trans and is therefore literally the best person to talk to about things like binders and exploring 'masculine' expression. But I just can't bring myself to. All I need to say is 'hey so I actually wanted to see how I'd feel wearing a binder and I wanted to get this one - what do you think?' But I'm SO SCARED.

I feel the same about pronouns. Even my name sometimes. Ever since I started questioning, I notice ever single ""she"" I hear. I've experimented with they/them online and with my best friend but again, I'm so scared to actually ask for them or tell my partner. 

It overwhelms me so much. I start to feel like an imposter. It doesn't help that old pictures have started feeling like a different person to me, for a lot of reasons but this included.

2021-01-09 19:22:38,ktxfkc,10,2,"I'm not sure I know what dysphoria is """"""supposed"""""" to feel like or typically feels like. But yesterday I had a really weird experience where I felt like I kind of hated my body but in a nondiscrimate way? Like there are definitely parts of my body that trigger dysphoria more than others (looking at you, tiddies) but this time it didn't feel like that particular part of my by body was what I was having issues with. It just felt like my *entire* body, especially when I actively looked at it in the mirror, wasn't mine and just was kind of wrong? I felt really disconnected to it. Like on someone else it might look good but on me it just looks like it doesn't belong to me. And the reason why I'm wondering whether this is unusual is because it wasn't like I had an idea in my head of what I want my body to look like (that would be facilitated by hormones, surgery and other gender affirming care - other than maybe top surgery or a breast reduction lol). I wasn't like 'My body would look more like me if it looked like X'. I don't have a concrete sense of 'if I had X body/body part and could remove Y body part I would feel better' like so many trans people seem to. Just a feeling of wrong ness and a lack of knowledge as to what rightness would look like. I know it was a gender related feeling though because thinking about how most people see me as a girl and the general discomfort I always feel about this is what triggered it. 

I think the reason why I didn't have an idea of what I wanted my body to look like especially when I was feeling that disconnection super intensely is because, apart from my massive chest, I don't have an issue with my body. My dysphoria is mostly social, and intensely so, so much that just looking at myself in the mirror and coming to the conclusions that other people come to about my gender because of my body made me feel gross. I'm agender and subsequently, when I'm in the right headspace, see my body as also not gendered. But gender is violently pushed upon body parts, and knowing that I am curvy and that people feminize me because of it is really hard. Getting 'masculine' gendered features would just mean I would be misgendered in the opposite way. I just want my body to be intensely neutral but I also wish I didn't need to change it because at my very core (apart from the chest) I don't see my body as gendered, it's the *perception* of it and not the actually body that is the problem. This is an issue that is inevitably worsened by the fact that I'm in a transphobic environment and can't really leave soon, and being out is not really an option. I guess I felt abnormal because most of the time I see people talk about dysphoria, they have an idea of what they WANT to look like, and it's because they want their body gendered in a DIFFERENT way, not not-gendered at all.

I'm just getting acquainted with being nonbinary I haven't known for too long but I'm just wondering if some things are normal. I feel I'm a person that needs attention a lot of the time. I don't know if I just think that I'm nonbinary to get attention or if I actually am. I also feel just so happy inside when I do an androgynous voice or act androgynous, I don't know if that's a me-being-obsessed-with-roleplaying-thing or a nonbinary thing. Because I do love roleplay and I do love acting and voice acting but how do I know if this is a me being happy or my nonbinary being happy.

Another thing. I live in a very republican and non accepting household so this could just be me subconsciously making up excuses that ""Yes I'm a girl my parents aren't going to kick me out"" or are they real? I'm aware that this probably makes zero sense and is probably a very specific issue but I just need to know the answers to these issues because they're eating me up inside. 

Also quick disclaimer I only come to reddit when I'm kind of going insane and shaken from a bad experience and just start rambling out of stupid places in my mind. So just aware that I was in a different mindset while I was writing this and that's why it might be very dramatic and chaotic.

I am super new to moderating but I made this account specifically because I felt like there is a lack of community for people my age if I’m being honest.

I thought it may be a nice niche to fill to have a space for those of us navigating gender between those two age brackets. One of my friends said it my not be necessary because mostly the people that need support are the people new to these experiences but I figured I’d start it and see if it had any traction.

As I’ve said! I have never been a mod of any forum before so if people would like to help or have any suggestions as to how I can make it as welcoming and helpful as possible/how to reach out to people would be very welcome.

2021-01-10 12:18:49,kudizc,2,1,"Hi all! Apologies for how choppy this is, hope you’ll bear with me!

I’ve been questioning my gender and I’m super turned around. I know that however I want to present and whatever pronouns I use can change whenever I want them to and that’s ok! But I’m still terrified of being ‘wrong’

I’m (23) AFAB, and I’ve been getting more and more uncomfortable with my body. I’m relatively athletic but I’ve got wide hips and am fairly busty for my frame. I love so much about my body because it’s gotten me through so much, and I’m grateful for its strength and resiliency. And I think I’ve got great breasts, but they also make me sad quite a bit. My chest doesn’t look IRL how it does in my head, which becomes all the more evident when I put on masculine clothing. And my hips are so much wider than I wish they were, making my outline look way more stereotypically feminine than I want it to and screwing up how I want my clothes to look on me. When I don’t look in a mirror too often, I feel pretty good about myself. In my mind’s eye, I’m a masculine-leaning androgynous person, with a sharp jawline and an easy smile. But then I catch my reflection, and it all comes crashing down. And I feel super guilty because I want to love my body for what it is, and womanhood has generally been pretty comfortable for me - or at least I thought it was. Not anymore, though.

My rabbi uses they/them pronouns for me (at my request) and it feels SO wonderful when she does. But there are parts of my life where I have no choice but to remain closeted, so I wonder how worth it it is to try to explore pronouns when there’s a big chunk of my life where I’ll have to use my assigned gender anyway. I don’t know what would hurt more - to ignore it completely, or to live what feels like two different lives.

And then there’s my family. My sister is super supportive and on board, which is awesome. I guess our parents think gender-expansiveness is more a fad than anything, which isn’t wonderful. The rest of the fam... most are pretty conservative and I don’t have super high hopes. So again, I keep wondering how worth it really exploring myself would be.

But then - I read Noelle Stevenson’s comic “The Weight of Them” and related to just about every panel. And watching Theo’s transition storyline in the Sabrina show on Netflix just makes me smile from ear to ear as he continues to figure himself out. I get a lot of joy when someone calls me “sir” in public, being called “them” makes me smile, and she/her pronouns give me mostly apathy but with a small cringe.

But there are parts of my life where I have no choice but to remain closeted, so I wonder how worth it it is to try to explore pronouns when there’s a big chunk of my life where I’ll have to use my assigned gender anyway. I don’t know what would hurt more - to ignore it completely, or to live what feels like two different lives.\n\nAnd then there’s my family. My sister is super supportive and on board, which is awesome. I guess our parents think gender-expansiveness is more a fad than anything, which isn’t wonderful. The rest of the fam... most are pretty conservative and I don’t have super high hopes. So again, I keep wondering how worth it really exploring myself would be.\n\nBut then - I read Noelle Stevenson’s comic “The Weight of Them” and related to just about every panel. And watching Theo’s transition storyline in the Sabrina show on Netflix just makes me smile from ear to ear as he continues to figure himself out. I get a lot of joy when someone calls me “sir” in public, being called “them” makes me smile, and she/her pronouns give me mostly apathy but with a small cringe.\n\nI don’t know what I’m hoping for here. Venting? Encouragement? Affirmations? Guidance?

I am an amateur seamstress currently teaching myself how to draft my own patterns and am looking for a project to work on.

I've noticed that there seems to be a lack of femme clothing options that have been designed for AMAB bodies. Most ""feminine"" clothing is designed for an AFAB body, which can cause fit issues, especially if its a fitted garment. The ones that I have found seem to be pretty costume-esque, which is cool but may not be very functional for everyday life.

If you could have clothing that was designed for an AMAB body, what styles/types of clothing would you choose, especially clothing that you could wear in everyday situations and feel comfortable in?  I'm AFAB and present pretty masculine so I'm out of my league idea wise.

Any suggestions are greatly appreciated!",NonBinary,A fashion question for my AMAB femme peeps,1610329393.0,"{'created_utc': 1610304193, 'id': 'kuk0f1', 'num_comments': 6, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Howdy!\n\nI am an amateur seamstress currently teaching myself how to draft my own patterns and am looking for a project to work on.\n\nI\'ve noticed that there seems to be a lack of femme clothing options that have been designed for AMAB bodies.

2021-01-10 23:11:49,kupl1k,7,4,"I'll preface this by saying I think every person has the right to use whatever pronouns they want and that's their decision and their decision alone. So I have absolutely no problem referring to someone as ""it"" if it asks me to! I don't think any pronoun is more valid than another so I hope this doesn't come off as judgemental, I just genuinely want to learn more about different perspectives in the GSM community. 

My question arises from the fact that I've seen ""it"" used in a hurtful derogatory way to degrade and dehumanize queer/GSM people, especially trans people in response to asking someone (usually a cis bigot) to use the pronouns they want. I've been called and ""it"" in a purposefully hurtful way before so I was kind of shocked the first time I saw someone on this subreddit asking others to use ""it/its"".

  My child is 13 years old, and has informed us that they identify as nonbinary.  While they have not asked us to not use specific pronouns, they have asked that we not use the term ""girl"" or ""daughter"".

  How else can I support them?  If I'm being completely honest, referring to them as 'my child' and 'them' instead of my 'daughter' and 'little girl' seems so very impersonal.

I’m still discerning whether I myself am Nonbinary or just a Cis Bi woman who is very gender non conformative, loves crossplay/drag, &amp; wants to remove her boobs. (I don’t really care about pronouns so I just go by She/Her usually cause that’s low maintenance) but I strongly identify with most Nonbinary posts/content I see, so I thought this was worth a shot. 

I have always just not really enjoyed my boobs, &amp; found them to be in the way &amp; not worth the hassle except once in a while when they looked nice in a particular dress. I love the ‘femboy’ aesthetic &amp; have for years wished I could have that nice flat look under my shirts without having to wear a binder. But I have no problem with my feminine shoulders, hips or genitals (other than finding all genitals gross in general because I’m on the Ace spectrum lol)

So I tried to brush it off as “oh all women have body image issues &amp; hate their boobs. This is totally normal.”

Then it suddenly occurred to me about 6 months ago that top surgery WAS a thing, &amp; there are enby folks out there who just get that, without hormones or other transitioning steps....&amp; realizing that was a viable (if expensive &amp; complicated) option immediately made me SO HAPPY. 

That excitement every time I think of removing these stupid unnecessary lumps has not gone away &amp; I have no idea how I’ll ever save up that $8,000 MINIMUM to get an elective surgery (especially with a kid on the way now) but I have hope &amp; the thought of that was keeping me going but.....

NOW I’M PREGNANT. &amp; the first thing that happened was that my boobs went up a letter in like a month. 34B sucked &amp; was already giving me back pain, but it was manageable. Now I’m at least a C cup &amp; none of my boobcages fit right, I have even worse back pain, &amp; I’m always miserable &amp; exhausted.

There are way worse pregnancy side effects than your breasts LITERALLY DOING WHAT THEY’RE SUPPOSED TO &amp; FULFILLING THEIR PURPOSE I UNDERSTAND THAT. But that’s the one that’s bugging me the most. 

I’m so excited to be a mom &amp; start a family with the love of my life but also being pregnant is a horrible experience &amp; having to deal with these massive sacks of milk &amp; fat that just keep getting bigger is just the icing on the cake of shit. It’s really overwhelming &amp; I feel like my body is attacking me. 

I really need help so I can stop wishing I had breast cancer so there was a reason to remove them which I KNOW is a very unhealthy &amp; horrible coping mechanism but my brain keeps bringing it up anyway. 

I was wondering if anyone on here had gone through a similar experience &amp; had advice on something that might help, since top surgery obviously isn’t an option for a few years at least, &amp; not a lot of pregnancy sites cover these sort of struggles so I’m feeling very alone😅

(I’m so sorry for the long post)

2021-01-12 02:00:07,kvhqtu,12,1,"&gt;Dear Parents,  
&gt;  
&gt;	I am writing this letter to inform you and make a request about something truly important to me. I can never be completely ready to tell you this, but considering its significance, it is necessary. Instead of trying to box me into the norm and facing me with detest and loathing, I hope to receive love, affection, and acceptance.   
&gt;  
&gt;	Adolescence is often a difficult period for everyone. Personally, it has been a source of great distress ever since the age of 10. My body is constantly changing, and I cannot accept the changes that have occurred during puberty. No words can express the fear of turning into something that is not me. Simply the notion of myself growing up as a woman provokes disgust and loathing within me. For example, breast development has been one of my biggest source of anguish for me. I always try to hide it, but this contributes to bad posture. I want my body to have neither masculine nor feminine features. There are two possible explanations for this, 1. it’s only a phase and I am so immature, or 2. because I am non-binary specifically Agender. The first explanation seems unlikely because I have been struggling with this for years, so it cannot be just a phase. Through numerous research and thinking, I ended up with a conclusion that I am Agender, and I accepted it. Although my gender identity is not an issue, there is still one problem yet to be faced. My discomfort in my own body, also known as Gender Dysphoria, is a matter that needs to be solved. Gender Dysphoria is a huge issue that can lead to tremendous mental health problems.   
&gt;  
&gt;	The ultimate solution I have found is Puberty Blockers. They are medicines that temporarily stop puberty. You have a choice between a shot that is renewed every month or an implant that lasts one to two years. I hope you consider it with an open mind, acknowledging both pros and cons. Puberty blockers are beneficial because they provide time to think carefully about gender identity, preventing the irreversible change that occurs in puberty. They are reversible, puberty simply resumes when you stop using it. A side-effect of puberty-blockers that is also beneficial is taller adult height because of delayed growth plate closure. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the changes in puberty cannot be reversed, so the earlier you take it the better. However, there are two unfavorable sides of puberty blockers. Puberty blockers can lead to lower bone density, which can be prevented by taking more calcium. Another unfavorable part is how expensive it is, although the price depends on each individual.   
&gt;  
&gt;	Now, I would like to make a note about researching transgender-related topics, to use a credible source. Especially if the resource is produced by TERF (Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminist) because they are very manipulative.   
&gt;  
&gt;	Lastly, I would like to reinforce the intensity of my struggles with gender identity. This is a struggle that has taken over me over years. It is difficult to imagine myself growing up as a woman, and I imagine the anguish would aggravate as I get older. Without the use of Puberty Blockers, I would most likely get a top-surgery to feel a sense of identity as an adult. However, please ask yourself if I deserve to go through that excessive torment and anguish, and have such a lack of identity that can be prevented now. I beseech you to allow me to take Puberty Blockers. It would change my entire life for the better, and it will be because of you. I understand that this is a fact that's difficult to accept right away, but I hope that you will accept me, and agree to this request.

Hey, I’m AFAB and have been questioning for about 3 years. It’s basically a constant back and forth of wondering if I’m just cis or if I’m nonbinary. I’m pretty certain I’m not a guy, as I kinda just hate the concept of masculinity. I’m really sure how to explain that, but nothing about what makes being a “man” a “man” seems appealing.  But as much as I dislike masculinity, I’m not sure about my feelings on femininity. I’ve always been quite a tomboy, but I can’t recall seeing myself as not a girl. Whenever I actually cut my hair short was when I started questioning my gender. I think it was partially just because I started to learn more about LGBTQ stuff, but also because I would occasionally start getting referred to as “sir” and such. Eventually, I came to the conclusion that I was cis, and it was being referred to/and viewing myself in masculine ways that made me uncomfortable.

I was more than happy and reassured with this revelation, until one day I started questioning again. I really don’t know what happened, I knew who I was, knew wanted to be and look like, and was comfortable with my body... until I didn’t. At this point I had grown my hair about to shoulder length and began to view myself more femininely, but I can’t tell if I liked it. I went out somewhere one night and felt like I had reached the epitome of the e-girl-esque look I wanted, but I couldn’t really tell if I liked it. Recently, I’ve looked more into androgynous looks, but once again, I can’t tell if I would actually like it on me.

With also questioning my sexuality, I think the biggest issue I face is not being able to tell if I wanna look like someone or if I’m attracted to them. I can’t seem to find the key in differentiating the two. For example, I said earlier that I randomly started questioning my gender again. This happened in nearly an instant. I was looking at this skirt on Amazon that I considered buying when I thought about the fact that I’d probably be attracted to a boy wearing that same skirt. Then I thought, “What if I was that boy?” and it just went downhill from there.

A final thought (apologies for the very not organized format): I saw a TikTok about how people should stop saying that people who question there gender are inherently trans, as cis people can and should do the same. One of the comments said something along the lines of how women often don’t feel comfortable being viewed as women.

First in English, since that's the language of the sub, then in Spanish.

Primero en inglés, debido a que ése es el idioma de esta sub, después en español.

I'm an NB who's been studying Spanish (Argentina Spanish specifically) quite seriously for the past several months, and of course, there's the issue in Spanish that the grammar itself is gendered. I've done a little bit of research into how nonbinary language is approached in the Spanish-speaking world, but I'm finding that it's definitely not as straight-forward as it is in English for a few reasons. I tried to find a subreddit or other online forum like this one, but I wasn't able to. I've also found that my language learning partners I talk to through the app Tandem (which I recommend highly) generally seem very confounded by the concept. Even the most LGBTQ+-friendly person I've met on there so far was supportive but said they'd never met anyone nonbinary before, so I'm gathering the impression that the concept hasn't taken off in the Spanish-speaking world at large as much as it has in the English-speaking world, or at least the US, UK, and maybe Australia (not sure, would be curious, if any Australians have read this far).

So I have a few questions:

* Is there a sub or online forum that I've missed for Spanish-speaking NBs? Or maybe one that's all-encompassing LGBTQ+?
* I'm aware of two linguistic options in Spanish, the use of -x or -e as gender-neutral endings for nouns and adjectives. I've tried to use -e a little bit, since it's more straight-forward in its pronunciation and reflects the existing language better, but my language learning partners have thought that I was just making a mistake each time. What linguistic choices do you make in referring to yourself and other NBs? Is one choice leading over others? Where can I learn more?
* Am I correct that the nonbinary movement in the Spanish-speaking world is very young and the average person is not yet familiar with it?
* What is the culture surrounding NB issues like in your culture, including Spanish-speaking communities within English-speaking countries?
* Any other advice that comes to mind for an NB newcomer to Spanish?

Thanks very much for your help! ✌️

Soy un NB quien ha estado estudiando español (español rioplatense en particular) bastante seriamente por las últimas pocas meses, y por supuesto, en español hay el problema que la gramática misma usa los dos géneros binarios. Yo he hecho algunas investigaciones sobre cómo se trata la lengua no binaria en el mundo hispanohablante, pero estoy encontrado que definitivamente no es tan sencillo como en inglés por unos pocos razones. Intenté encontrar otra subreddit o otro foro en línea como ésta, pero no tenía éxito. También he encontrado que mis socios de aprendizaje de idiomas con los que hablo a través de la app Tandem (que recomiendo fuertemente) generalmente parecen muy confundidos por el concepto. Incluso la persona más amigable con LGBTQ+ que yo he conocido allí me mostró apoyo pero dijo que nunca antes había conocido otra persona no binaria, así que tengo la impresión que el concepto no ha despegado en el mundo hispanohablante tanto como en el mundo de habla inglesa, o al menos en los EE.UU., el R.U., o Australia (no estoy seguro, tengo curiosidad, si algún australiano ha leído hasta aquí).

Así que tengo unas pocas preguntas:

* ¿Hay una sub o un foro en línea para hispanohablantes no binarios que yo he perdido? O podría ser una que abarca toda la comunidad LGBTQ+?
* Conozco dos opciones lingüísticas en español, los usos de -x y de -e como terminaciones sin género de los sustantivos y los adjetivos. He intentado usar -e un poco, debido a que es más sencillo en su pronunciación y refleja mejor el idioma existente, pero mis socios de aprendizaje de idiomas han pensado que yo solamente estuviera cometiendo un error cada vez. ¿Qué elecciones lingüísticas toma Usted al referirse a sí mismo y a otros no binarios? ¿Hay una opción por delante de las demás?
* ¿Estoy en lo cierto al pensar que el movimiento no binario en el mundo hispanohablante sea muy jóven y que la persona promedia aún no lo conozca?
* ¿Cómo es la cultura sobre cuestiones no binarias en su cultura, incluso comunidades hispanohablantes dentro de países de habla inglesa?
* ¿Le viene a la mente a Usted otro consejo para un recién llegado al español no binario?

2021-01-12 17:24:36,kvw31o,1,2,"Hello! Im 23 and afab agender (she/her pronouns). My whole life i was raised gender neutral pretty much, despite my father being kind of insistant that i was your average girl (eg being told a womans hair was her beauty wheni wanted to cut it). Sometimes i wore dresses but sometimes i just walked around looking like a skater dude. I think he eventually got it because he got me batman and superman boxers one year completely unprompted. My gender at the time was neither defined or in flux. I just kind of existed and wore what I felt looking like at the time. 


Flash forward 7 years and I've tried all the things: short hair, they/them pronouns, binders, etc. I was trying to see if my gender was more masc or neutrois and it wasn't that either. I had brief moments of euphoria but it wasn't connected to any one thing or any sort of trend. 


When I look in the mirror nowadays, I feel as if i look very masculine despite being afab (i have never taken hormones). I often find myself thinking, ""I want to look like a pretty girl"" but have no gender attached to that thought. Like its more of a costume I would like to wear for the day. The same goes for i want to look masc or more butch today. 


What spurned this post was the thought i had : ""i want to transition into a pretty girl"". Transitioning has never came up in my mind before. 
I still dont really identify with having any gender but why would the thought come across like that if im already afab? I dont need to transition into anything! Unless i am so deeply agender/gender neutral that my unconscious doesnt even see myself as afab. I certainly don't see it myself when i look in the mirror unless i try really hard. I dont see any of my body parts as necessarily female either unless im dressing up as femme for the day. 



The vision of myself i have in my head for the future is a long haired and heavily tatted me with a lot less chest. Its totally obtainable, but isnt any more feminine than it is masculine. 


Is what im experiencing a disconnect between what society has ingrained in me to be like (pretty girl) vs what i actually am (nothing)? Has anyone else noticed this about themselves? Or the more that you consume media with a certain demographic (eg femme, masc, punk etc) does it make you want to look like that more?

Im 23 and afab agender (she/her pronouns). My whole life i was raised gender neutral pretty much, despite my father being kind of insistant that i was your average girl (eg being told a womans hair was her beauty wheni wanted to cut it). Sometimes i wore dresses but sometimes i just walked around looking like a skater dude. I think he eventually got it because he got me batman and superman boxers one year completely unprompted. My gender at the time was neither defined or in flux. I just kind of existed and wore what I felt looking like at the time. \n\n\nFlash forward 7 years and I\'ve tried all the things: short hair, they/them pronouns, binders, etc. I was trying to see if my gender was more masc or neutrois and it wasn\'t that either. I had brief moments of euphoria but it wasn\'t connected to any one thing or any sort of trend. \n\n\nWhen I look in the mirror nowadays, I feel as if i look very masculine despite being afab (i have never taken hormones). I often find myself thinking, ""I want to look like a pretty girl"" but have no gender attached to that thought. Like its more of a costume I would like to wear for the day. The same goes for i want to look masc or more butch today. \n\n\nWhat spurned this post was the thought i had : ""i want to transition into a pretty girl"".

I went with demigirl because for 70-80% of the time I either don't think about my gender or are perfectly fine with being afab. I just want to know other's opinions. 

Earliest memory of gender related stress was when I was maybe around 9 years old when I learnt that when I grew up I would get a bigger chest, I will get my period and that I don't have the same genitals as males do. This lead to an almost daily questions to my mum for around half a year ""why wasn't I born a boy? Can I be a boy when in older?"" Etc. I had no concept of anything to do with transgender people, all I knew is that I did not want to be a girl when I grew up.

After a while I had to stop asking that and internalise all the dread that came with growing up. I often wished to be a boy through primary school and even into secondary school. 

Now I am more accepting that I look feminine and even enjoy dressing as such since I recently got my first dress. 

However even in recent years I've had mental breakdowns about my body and how I wasn't born male. My biggest one was a school camp when I saw all the boys just standing there changing their shirts.

Although I've more accepted things now and embrace it, I still get bouts of heavy.... Dysphoria ig. Like this body isn't right, it's not mine and I should've been born a boy. 

I know I would've been happier as male, the male body and way of think just makes more sense to me. I hadn't even started being remotely girly until I did make my first best ever, when I was 14. 

I now have a big group of girlfriends and one of my best friends is gender fluid.

It's a fight between whether I'm female and get episodes of dysphoria or am I male but have grown to better live with my body I was born with.

2021-01-13 10:15:16,kwdnwt,10,1,"*""...you look like a man?""* Hahaha. Which man, in your life and not on TV, looks like this?

*""...you don't look androgynous?""* Androgyny isn't non-binary. Both are valid, but not the same thing. I'm not trying to be.

*""...you don't mix and match men's and women's clothes?""* Non-binary isn't always being in between two established points on the scale in your head. That's one way (totes valid) to do it, but I'm off the scale. Quite literally. Lines extend outwards too.

&amp;#x200B;

My answer to ""how are you non-binary when you look like that?"" is this:

*Inside.*

Inside where a label that fits me (and now wearing what the devil I like) means I no longer have impostor syndrome about passing for male. I'm not trying to pass unnoticed as ""one of"" men. Inside I'm comfortable I'm outside the group and outside onlookers going ""what the.."" means I don't have to worry what will happen when I'm found out.

I realised I was trans &amp; non-binary in the 1990s, mistakenly thought it also meant 'need to be skinny &amp; androgynous', tried those, failed at them, felt ashamed, squashed it all back down into denial, had a realization &amp; came back out two years ago. 

One time I half jokingly and said to someone, ""My gender is boffin, and my pronoun is sir"" But the more I think about it the more I feel that coming off of a 2D scale (that places everyone at M or F or only inbetween)  and into a 3D space means gender doesn't have to be all about combining masculinity and femininity at all. And that M and F don't have to be end-points. And how male you are isn't always how female you aren't.

My aesthetic may be ""uncle who's secretly a wizard from an 80s Disney kids movie"" (and hey I'm fine with that and yes it's deliberate). *But that's non-binary too, if a non-binary person is doing it.*

So yeah - mask wearing is dicking with my usual daily dose of ""who the fuck does that guy think he is?"" stares but:

2021-01-14 07:34:10,kx10np,4,1,"Heya! Soo, I came out to most people like a month ago. Told them that I use a new name and different pronouns, and that I really dislike it when people use my deadname/ old pronouns.
Some people were really accepting, one of them even helped me look for more neutral terms in my native language (we don't really have they/them and we gender litterally everything. Stone? Has a gender. Tree? Has a gender. Your blue shirt with a stain on it? Yuuup, that has a gender. The stain too), some people told me that they are accepting of it but their behaviour doesn' t show it.
To clarify that, I mostly used a gender neutral nickname (which is a short version of my deadname) around friends. Some of them have apparently decided that using that is fine. One even messaged me and asked ""is it still okay if i use your nickname?"" aand i didnt want to spend ten years explaining stuff, so i told her that I'd prefer my new name, but i'll survive if she uses my old nickname.
Another one of my friends actually used a more masculine version of that nickname pretty much since she knew me, and was now reaaally proud of the fact that she ""was right"" or sth. Anyway, she insists on using that since ""its neutral anyways"" and ""thats who you'll always be to me"".
Add to that the fact that I have yet to come out to some of my more conservative friends (they were raised in a really reaaally transphobic and homophobic environment, and while they will usually become more accepting and understanding if you explain things properly and give them time, i don't feel like doing that right now) it's been a very fun month of being constantly misgendered and deadnamed by everyone but four people - even though every single person I came out to told me that they would support me and all that..

One even messaged me and asked ""is it still okay if i use your nickname?"" aand i didnt want to spend ten years explaining stuff, so i told her that I\'d prefer my new name, but i\'ll survive if she uses my old nickname.\nAnother one of my friends actually used a more masculine version of that nickname pretty much since she knew me, and was now reaaally proud of the fact that she ""was right"" or sth. Anyway, she insists on using that since ""its neutral anyways"" and ""thats who you\'ll always be to me"".\nAdd to that the fact that I have yet to come out to some of my more conservative friends (they were raised in a really reaaally transphobic and homophobic environment, and while they will usually become more accepting and understanding if you explain things properly and give them time, i don\'t feel like doing that right now) it\'s been a very fun month of being constantly misgendered and deadnamed by everyone but four people - even though every single person I came out to told me that they would support me and all that..\nYeaa, I think i\'m done ranting for now, thanks for reading through that wall of text 💜 hope you have a nice day 🐢\nTl;dr: my ""supportive"" friends keep permanently deadnaming and misgendering me while also telling me that its okay since  theyre using a neutral name.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Just needed to talk about this..', 'created': 1610634850.0}"

frog/froggy - my fav animal is a frog and i think it’d be cool. also no gendered ties which is pog

mars - i’m a quiet person, i’m kind of interested in a more strong name, i want to push myself to fit the name and become stronger!!

ari/adri/adrien - somewhat gender neutral, probably the most socially acceptable on the list. also i like having a capital A in the name because i can write them to look like stars. but... i don’t know if i like it as much as the others, i don’t want to choose a normal name just to appease my parents...

knives - yes this is stolen from scott pilgrim i don’t want to have people always associate me with that though i just think knives is a sick as hell name

nico - another normalish one but this one just gives me better vibes but also if anybody compares me to the anime character i will probably have to change names or just die

pen - androgynous and comfy bc people already call me this on the internet. but if anyone compares it to penis ill kill someone i’m worried about it

I unintentionally started to wear exclusivelly binder-like bras about four years ago. It's kind of an elastic sports-brelette? It basically has no shape and it slightly compresses my chest.

I don't want one my size because I dont really need my chest to be completely flat, i just want the tiddies out of my peripheral vision and I dont want them to move. I also worry that the full compression might be too much for my sensory issues.

2021-01-15 09:44:41,kxrdgi,5,1,"I've considered myself non-binary for a few years now but recently I've been wondering if I'm actually just a transgender man. I was wondering if anyone here has any advice to distinguish one from another? Part of the issue is the I have OCD so it can be difficult to distinguish between thoughts that are occurring naturally and those that stem from the OCD.

My main reasons for thinking I'm a man are that I like being perceived as male, prefer to present in as masculine a way as possible most of the time, would strongly like to have male secondary sex characteristics (this causes quite a bit of dysphoria) and often have a desire to look and, to some extent, be like male characters on TV but not female ones. I started noticing this when I was about eight or nine (before this I dont think I was very aware of gender being a thing) after discovering that once I got a haircut and some kids though I was a boy that it made me happy. Around the same time (possibly before) I also started trying to change my name a lot and would try and convince people to call me more masculine names (Alex, Louie and Charlie). I also found the idea of being seen as a girl deeply uncomfortable but couldn't work out why since I quite like most girls.

Another possibly relevant point is that my mother has asked me if I'm transgender several times (I think initially when I was thirteen). I have told her I am not, mostly because I would prefer not to make a major life decision without ensuring I have completely thought it through and the idea of getting bottom surgery doesn't really appeal to me as my bottom dysphoria is mild and the results don't sound good enough to be worth a major surgery.

Two aspects of this that are somewhat strange and that I haven't seen online are that it was always a case of wanting to be a man rather than thinking I was one and that when I'm not thinking about it I can actually forget that my body is female. The first one is probably self explanatory, the second one is difficult to describe though. An easy example is that I'll forget that I have breasts and occasionally it feels like they aren't actually there and that my chest is just flat. I have considered the possibility that this is a hallucination but do not think so after doing research.

My main reasons for thinking I'm not a man are that I don't usually experience much bottom dysphoria, didn't (as far as I can remember) feel dysphoria at an extreamly young age and have some doubts as to weather I'd be making the right decision by trying to transition. The lack of dysphoria when I was very young  is the main thing that concerns me as most transgender people seem to know when they're four or five and at that age I didn't. I also enjoyed trying both traditionally masculine and feminine things and would flip from being an extreme 'tomboy' to much more traditionally feminine. While when I was young I did have a lot of male friends that also hasn't consistently been the case although this was mostly because I wasn't able to join in properly when they discovered sports (due to dyspraxia). I also have some fears that if I come out I could regret it or that I could be wrong and fuck up massively.

I'm interested in wearing some basic makeup casually, lipstick/gloss, nail polish, but not much more than that. The big things I need to change are my weight (I'm 5'7 and 195 pounds) I've been working to lower that for a long time, made some progress but a lot more to go. The other thing I need to do something about is my body hair. I don't have a crazy amount, but definitely a masculine amount of hair all over my legs, arms, chest and stomach. It grows pretty fast, and I just don't know if shaving or waxing is gonna be a viable option for me, but I don't really know what else I could do. I've also thought about messing with my eyebrows, which are somewhat thick and bushy, but not really sure on how that would work. I'm generally comfortable with myself, and I'm okay with looking more masculine, but I do want to be able to be as androgynous as reasonably possible and any tips that could help me with that would be greatly appreciated."", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'How to look androgynous (amab)', 'created': 1610735516.0}"

2021-01-16 19:53:08,kypzna,3,1,"Hey everyone! I'm just gonna put my past experiences and ask my question in the end.
So, several years ago i questioned my gender and thought i was ftm trans. I also presented male and used he/him pronouns. After some time though, i realised i'm not a boy and started presenting female again.
I got to know all my internet friends at that time and they still use he/him, which is fine for me.
I rlly miss my short hair btw.
When i started using she/her online again (i'm saying online cause nobody really uses pronouns irl often anyways) it felt off and weird and i stopped it.
Of course i knew about nonbinary people and they/them pronouns but because i watched kalvin garrah for some time (gladly stopped that long time ago) it was always kinda in my head that nonbinary people are weird (which i of course DONT think!!) 
I have since seen a lot of different beautiful nonbinary people and suddenly some days ago, when i randomly saw they/them pronouns in someones bio, it kinda clicked? I feel very comfortable using them and like the really fit me.
However, i'm scared that i'm faking it and should just use she/her to make it easier, and secondly i don't know if i can identify as nonbinary bc its still somewhere in my head that they're weird (and i'm weird too but i hope you know what i mean)

2021-01-17 04:34:02,kyzfyw,1,1,"Hi there. I had a question for anyone who's transitioned AMAB to nonbinary. I just came out a few months ago and have just recently had the money and space to start transitioning for real. I'm starting to figure out things I like. I still think I want to present on the masc side of things, still only wear black clothing, still prioritize comfort...  but there's a couple of things about my body that are just so hyper masculine they really bother me now and I was wondering if y'all had any advice. I'm broke af so surgeries are probably off the table or at least not going to happen anytime soon.

Voice - It's super deep and gravely. I know there's nothing that can really be done about it other than voice training. I really don't want to walk through my life giving a vocal performance 24 hours a day and from the videos I've watched that seems to pretty much be the reality of it. I've kind of given up on this one and am just trying to tell myself that I don't owe it to anyone to have a voice that matches my appearance or whatever, but if I'm being honest it still bugs me. Any options I've missed?

Huge Rib Cage - I think I would actually already have a pretty nice curve if not for this gigantic rib cage. I'm not looking for a hyper-feminine shape, but it would be nice if there was enough curve to hold a skirt up. Do corsets work? Are they healthy? 

Body Hair - I guess this is something most women deal with cis or trans, but ffs shaving is time consuming and painful. I feel like my skin is always red and irritated now, but if I don't shave at least a few times a week it feels gross and dysphoric.

I've read a little bit about micro-dosing HRT but there doesn't really seem to be much information on it, plus I probably can't afford it right away. Some of the effects of HRT seem really appealing, but I like my penis so erectile dysfunction and shrinkage seem like a really high price to pay for the benefits-primarily hair, skin, and weight distribution. Is MTF (MTNB?) HRT a thing if you're trying to keep use of your penis? Would micro-dosing have the same effect on genitalia? Or just taking the E without the T-blockers?

My best friend came out as non-binary about six months ago, after seeing Gigi Goode and Nico Tortorella on Drag Rage. I think they were newer to the concept because they started with calling themself “gender neutral” and “gender non conforming” before seeming to learn the word “non-binary”. 

My best friend has never given a fuck about gender norms and has always enjoyed playing with fashion and shopping in the women’s section and wearing some makeup. When they finally figured out the might not just be gay, but also non-binary, it made perfect sense. They started using they/them but I have never heard them correctly use their own pronouns. When speaking in the third person they always say he/him and sometime go back to correct themself, but not always. They often still refer to themself as a boy or gay man, but other times, when speaking purposefully about gender, they remark how they are not a man. 

Anyway, I get the sense that they do often still identify as he/him, a man, a boy, a gay man, a son— because they naturally still call themselves these things. I worry they found this other box that isn’t man or woman and felt like they had to dive in fully and abandon every gendered word, even if some of them still feel fine. I think they should be able to define non-binary however they would like and not exist in some rigid system that’s just a replacement for the rigid system you just got out of. 

I don’t know if this is an appropriate conversation to begin with my best friend and I don’t want to be insensitive about anything they are going through. I also respect this is a journey they need to go on for themself. Also I could be completely wrong and maybe this is normal!

2021-01-17 09:41:15,kz3kk1,7,1,"Am I being an asshole? I really don’t know how to sort out my feelings. 

Context: I’m AFAB/agender/demigirl that’s attracted to femininity/people with femme energy/women. For simplicity’s sake, let’s say I’m a cisgender lesbian. 
My partner is AFAB/non-binary/genderqueer and pansexual. 

As a sapphic person, I can’t help but be attracted to feminine people and body figures. I love my partner and am physically/emotionally attracted to them for many reasons, one reason being their body type. My partner naturally has a feminine body structure and large chest, which they eventually want to remove via top surgery. 

I understand large chests can be painful and uncomfortable, which is one reason why my partner wants top surgery. I want them to be comfortable in their body. At the same time, I have a strong feeling my feelings towards them will be negatively impacted because of their reduced chest size. 

I have past trauma with cisgender men that make me feel extremely uncomfortable and unsafe when I’m alone with masculine-leaning people. I associate flat chests with masculinity, and the prospect of having a partner that’s flat chested is borderline trauma inducing and not emotionally appealing. Not to mention that I’m not attracted to masculine bodies. 

My partner is hurt because as a pansexual person, their attraction towards others doesn’t hinge on physical appearance at all. For me, a sapphic, my attraction towards others is based off perceived femininity (emotional and physical). We can’t seem to find common ground between the different ways we experience attraction. I end up feeling selfish and shallow because (1) I’m not pansexual, (2) I can’t be attracted to non-feminine people, and (3) being a lesbian means my attraction is inherently based on physical appearance. 

I want to support my partner, but I can’t seem to get over this mental hurdle. I know my feelings towards top surgery are hurting them, but I don’t want to feel uncomfortable and unsafe around their presence because of the surgery. I know they’ll still be the same person no matter what, but my lesbian brain just doesn’t want to accept it.

2021-01-17 10:04:16,kz3u87,6,1,"I apologize if this isn't the proper place to put this as I am still very new to reddit and this is my first post. I am a 20 year old and I am AFAB. I figured out I was a lesbian by the time I was 14, but just recently I am truly questioning my gender. I don't remember feeling any sort of way about my gender growing up, just that I was more of a tomboy, but I know that really doesn't have anything to do with gender. The only thing that truly bothered me growing up was my name. It's a very stereotypical feminine name, and I have never liked it. So, when I was around 10 I gave myself a name that was androgynous, and I would call myself that in my head and I didn't tell anyone. (Is that weird? Cause in my head, I still call myself that name, and I still find it way more comforting then my birth name).

However, recently it has definitely changed. I get very uncomfortable with my chest for a period of time, while other times it doesn't bother me at all. The times where my chest became uncomfortable got so bad that I chose to get myself a binder to see if it helped, and it did, a lot. I never really thought about my gender growing up, but lately I feel disconnected with my body, like, some parts are fine while others I wish were different or were more masculine. I know that I don't want to be a man, but there are times I don't exactly want to be a woman either. These feelings fluctuate where I feel fine in my body, then I don't feel like I'm in the right body at all. With that, and the fact that I'm only having these feelings as an adult, I feel like I'm just faking it or something, even though I've literally told no one about this. From what I knew, people would question their gender as kids or teens, and maybe would figure it out as quickly or later on. Is it normal for some to only start questioning their gender as an adult?

2021-01-17 14:18:10,kz7705,4,1,"Sorry this got so long, also sorry you probably get a ton of these questions here. TL;DR at the bottom. 

Hello beautiful people, I am a 16 year old cis (i hope) female. For the past several months, I have been really struggling with a gender-related theme of OCD - basically, i have been obsessing and ruminating over my gender for months. I’ve had a few other themes of OCD in the past (fear that i was a pedophile, constant fear of throwing up, weird shit) but this one has been by far the worst for me. 

This was triggered by seeing something online about a person who realized they were nonbinary because they don’t mind they/them pronouns and they never felt comfortable in girls’ clothes. i also don’t really mind they/them pronouns and have never dressed really girly, so instantly this fear shot through me. 

Here’s some stuff about how i’ve been feeling:

- my constant rumination and overthinking about gender has made me feel very disconnected with my femininity and honestly just with myself.

- My entire life I have been proud to be a girl. i remember wanting boobs so bad in elementary school lol.

-  i still wish my body and face were more feminine as i don’t really have much in the way of boobs or hips.

- I had heard of nonbinary people before all this too and even had my pronouns (she/her at the time but now i feel detached from even that) in my bio on social media. So this wasn’t the first time i had heard of nb people i just didn’t really think much of the idea before i guess.

- I’ve just always been so happy in my female body and I know I still would be if i had never seen that thing online. 

- i am bi (although honestly the more time goes by the more i think i’m a lesbian lol) and i have heard that gay women often struggle with gender identity so that probably doesn’t help

- as i said before, i’m pretty flat and don’t really have the curves that women are supposed to have, so i guess sometimes i’ve had trouble feeling like a real “woman”. i know that’s dumb and you don’t need curves to be a woman, but i do feel like if i was curvier i might be more confident and feel more feminine which i would like to. 

- i really miss feeling confident in my gender and being proud of my womanhood. now it’s all clouded by this anxiety and i barely see myself in the mirror anymore. i just wanna go back to how i felt before all this

- all i really want to be is a cis girl. i don’t necessarily want to be nb. i swear it’s not because i don’t accept you all because that is so not the case i’ve actually become a lot more understanding of nb people throughout this whole thing so i’m really grateful for that. i just don’t really want it for myself??? but i’m scared i’m just in denial 

My question to you is - if i have been female my entire life and really liked being female, is it really possible to just become nonbinary out of the blue? 3 months ago I was happy and fine with my gender, could I really just all of a sudden be nb?? 

If you read this far thank you so much. I am going to therapy btw, although my therapist seems to focus on managing the anxiety this causes rather than the problem itself (she is older though and i don’t think she really understands what nonbinary is lol). 

Anyway I hope you all have a good day, I’m working on it and hopefully it’ll get better.

2021-01-18 15:59:14,kzxd03,6,1,"Hello everyone. I'm a guitar player of 20 years and ive had an idea as of recent. I went googling on the interwebs for LGBTQ guitar teachers/online courses for mainly beginners but couldn't seem to find any. My question for you all is this....

As a member of the LGBTQ community yourself, would you find a guitar course specifically designed and geared towards LGBTQ people to be beneficial? Would it also be something you would be willing to pay $5-10 a month for saying there was consistently new content by 1 LGBTQ teacher at first but adding more as the company grows? 

I'm thinking of starting up my own business on this as from the research ive done so far shows there is a market for it. 

I'm talking about a 0 to hero course. All the way from buying your first beginner guitar, all the way up to learning modes, and understanding theory in complex chord changes. 

The main selling point is this. Ive found with most online guitar courses that if your struggling to make it work you ask a question in the forum and if you don't get an answer from the teacher you out of luck. Instead i'm thinking of a platform where if the student is struggling then they get a 1on1 video call with the teacher. I know as a member of the LGBTQ community we are always worried about being ourselves, sometimes even in the comfort of our own home on a video call with a teacher. This would be a judgment free platform where you can come on the call as you are (obviously no nudity or profane content on the call) and get the help you need on whichever specific lesson your stuck on! 

This would be geared towards beginner guitar players at first and become more complex as the video series goes on.

Would it also be something you would be willing to pay $5-10 a month for saying there was consistently new content by 1 LGBTQ teacher at first but adding more as the company grows? \n\nI'm thinking of starting up my own business on this as from the research ive done so far shows there is a market for it. \n\nI'm talking about a 0 to hero course. All the way from buying your first beginner guitar, all the way up to learning modes, and understanding theory in complex chord changes. \n\nThe main selling point is this. Ive found with most online guitar courses that if your struggling to make it work you ask a question in the forum and if you don't get an answer from the teacher you out of luck. Instead i'm thinking of a platform where if the student is struggling then they get a 1on1 video call with the teacher. I know as a member of the LGBTQ community we are always worried about being ourselves, sometimes even in the comfort of our own home on a video call with a teacher. This would be a judgment free platform where you can come on the call as you are (obviously no nudity or profane content on the call) and get the help you need on whichever specific lesson your stuck on! \n\nThis would be geared towards beginner guitar players at first and become more complex as the video series goes on. \n\nWould anyone here be interested?"", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Question for all my LGBTQ musicians, specifically people who are looking to learn guitar', 'created': 1611010754.0}"

I’m so sad this morning.

I just met with the surgeon and she was so condescending, repeatedly told me that I would regret not getting a mastectomy (traditional top surgery) and that I’m going to come back to her disappointed and asking for another surgery. I told her very clearly that I am not binary trans and that I want to be able to present androgynously, which for me means both binding and sometimes accentuating my boobs. she said that a b cup (which i’m shooting for) will not make me look androgynous, it will look feminine. meanwhile, she incorrectly used she/her pronouns for me the whole time.

TW: I'm about to start talking about my body, body shape, trying to appear for masc. 

I knew I was non-binary more than ten years ago but have kinda just skated by not really talking about it, giving it a name, or trying to appear any specific way. Over the past year I've started to call myself non-binary, talked to people about it, and specified my pronouns as they/them in more spaces. I've had the talk with my boyfriend about what I am to him - a companion, not a girlfriend so that was massive for me. I feel like I found it easier to appear more masc before, but that might just be because I've been slowly adding more from elements to my style over the years (because of the positive reinforcement of friends and family) but I'm starting to reclaim a lot of the mascness of my style before and now realise that wearing beanies and big woolly jumpers was actually how I managed to do it before. 

I'm looking at binders because I want to sometimes appear for masc and sometimes more androgynous. I am the bustiest person I know, though, and don't know how to pick a size with regards to that. I'm worried that if I choose a size based on my chest that it will be ridiculously loose around my rib cage because I essentially have a 42"" bust and 32"" rib cage. 

Does anyone have any experience with this or advice? 

I'm going to kee googling and stuff like that but I'm finding it really hard to navigate, because most of the people I find have more manageable chests. I'm part of a group locally that I could ask but I'm also embarrassed to ask people and also there's a person in the group who has made me feel very invalidated before, though being open and honest might mend our relationship I think I'm not ready for that.

**tl;dr: how do I come out as a non-binary queer person who avoids drawing attention to themselves or having uncomfortable conversations?** 

I still occasionally have doubts, but am pretty comfortable and confident being non-binary after years of questioning and a few months of serious self-reflection. I've been gradually changing my pronouns on bios, Zoom, etc. over the past year (from she/her to she/they to they/she to they/them), and I've spoken to a few friends and one sibling about it. But, unless I'm on a Zoom call with them where they see my pronouns, my wider friends, colleagues, classmates, etc. don't realize that I really prefer they/them and gender-neutral language. I also haven't spoken to my parents or most of my siblings about gender at all, but they know I'm queer.

For the sake of not being misgendered quite as often, I've been thinking about tweeting from my professional/public account explaining my pronouns and that I'm non-binary. But I also don't want to make this a big deal, and the whole ""coming out"" narrative feels not great? Like I never came out as cis and I shouldn't have to come out as trans? But I also can't expect people to know without saying anything? I've been presenting in ways that feel comfortable to me for a while (besides a major haircut scheduled for Friday!) so I don't really have a way to visually cue without saying something. 

Beyond Twitter, my family follows me on all other social media platforms, so I  should probably speak to them before coming out publicly elsewhere? But I don't know how to do that either? 

&amp;#x200B;

2021-01-18 22:54:25,l060nf,2,1,"Hi! I've always identified as a girl but recently I've felt really inclined to start using she/they pronouns. I know that my family and friends will be supportive of it for the most part, but I just don't really know how to bring it up. I'm worried that they'd just be confused because 'it's come out of nowhere' or just keep referring to me as 'she' even if I make it clear to them that I have a preference for they/them. 

Another issue I've been having is with my clothes. I've been wanting to try more of an androgynous style because I love how it looks so much but I don't really know where to start. My boobs are something that makes me really self-conscious since wearing loose clothing usually makes me look a lot bigger than I am so I usually go for tighter-fitting clothes just to stop that, but I don't really know what to do to make that look more masculine. And I've tried wearing tighter bras to make them appear smaller but it just hurts and leaves marks on my skin. 

But this also causes another issue - most of the time I prefer looking more masculine, but then there are also times where I love looking feminine. When hairdressers open again, I'm going to get a haircut that I've been wanting for quite a while that will help me look more masculine, but then I'm really worried that I'll regret it because I can't look feminine when I'm feeling more feminine. I'm not sure if that's just because I'm overthinking everything but I don't really have anyone to talk about these things with.

I don't know - this is all just overwhelming me a lot since it's just a lot of change in a small amount of time, but I really want to find something that makes me feel more comfortable in my own skin, starting with the clothes that I wear. 

So if anyone has any advice as to how to bring this up to my family and where to start in terms of feeling more masculine, that would be really appreciated.

I have an appointment with a doctor to go over the possibility of top surgery. This is incredibly validating and I've been met with acceptance from the medical world - and I'm so grateful for that. However. Since my teen years, I've been struggling with an eating disorder. Through years of therapy, I'm in a WAY better place, but I'm not without of that ""ED voice"" in my head. Most days are good and it's been getting even better with wearing a binder and accepting my sexuality and gender). With that being said...I am nervous about top surgery. I am self conscious of my stomach (which has grown and gotten softer thanks to a healthier relationship with food :3). I'm a chubby enby and have small breasts (small Bs). I worry if I get rid of them, there's nothing to ""hide"" my stomach.

Has anyone else had to work through those feelings? My breasts make me feel dysphoric some days, but so does my stomach while healing from an eating disorder (and moving towards body neutrality). My binder does not make me entirely flat, so it's tricky.

Any chubby enbies out there with advice or words of wisdom? This may seem silly, but it's super real to me.

I had always considered myself a cis-het male and had never really actively explored my sexuality or gender beyond that. I fit the box, so I never felt any need, I think. So when my wife came out to me as non-binary, that was a pretty difficult experience. I had nearly zero knowledge on the subject, and found myself trying to be supportive, while also processing what this meant for me.

They asked me if it would change anything for our relationship, and I didn't feel I was able to authentically assure them in that moment, so I tried to explain that I was not attracted to men, and that it worried me that if they started to express themselves in a more masculine way, I was worried that I might not be attracted. 

From my perspective, there's a reality to attraction, and it's complicated. All bodies change in relationships, appearances change, and like any other relationship, ours could survive that. They haven't come to any conclusions about what they want to look like, as far as they've communicated to me, so it's hard for me to predict how that is going to make me feel. I don't know how to address that for myself.

The subsequent weeks were difficult for both of us, and I did my best to research, learn, affirm, support, but the damage of that initial interaction had already been done, and it has caused them a lot of concern about coming out to others, which I can understand. I think there's a major difference between coming out to a supportive friend and your partner -- the reality is that my reaction would have been much supportive if they were a friend or a family member -- but I don't really know how to communicate that without hurting them again.

I continue to find myself resistant to the idea, deep down, despite not wanting these feelings -- wishing it not to be true, or wishing it to be limited to labels or clothes. I am doing my best to keep these reactions to myself and just show support, but I also wish I could be honest about how I am feeling--without it being hurtful.

I've apologized as much as I can, and done my best to be supportive, enthusiastic even. From my perspective, if embracing this idea makes them happier, then that in and of itself would be a great thing for our relationship. I'm not really sure what I'm asking for here, but I'm looking for guidance on how I might be able to process this for myself, and how we might be able to move forward, perhaps stories from people who have gone through this themselves.

but the thing is, i’m not out to her yet.

i know for 100000000000% that i’m nonbinary and want a binder, but i’m not sure if i’m ready to come out yet. with the pandemic, i can’t just say that it’s for a friend, since it’s not like i could actually buy something for someone and send it over to them at a time like this.

i have already asked her for bits and bobs of help, but she’s been offering to buy it from her account and check the invoice to send it back.

this is a lovely gesture, but the parcel has my new name on, and the actual thing is a chest binder. so i can’t show her any of it without her finding out.

because of this, i’ve been hiding A LOT from her, and it’s been causing a larger and larger wedge between us. she has even started to think that there is someone grooming me or something, so that’s not good..

considering we are so close and she does so much for me, i don’t want our relationship to be worsened. i just don’t know how i can manage this and stay closeted at the same time.

and, dysphoria is getting so bad that i can’t just continue to be so uncomfortable with my body every day. i do need this binder, but i’ve kinda messed everything up.

so, yeah. i’m in desperate need of advise! if you see this, please help! i don’t know if it would just be better to come out to her or not. she is very accepting of the lgbt+ community and would almost defo support me, but she might just say i’m confused and too young :(

I'm a freshmen in high school, and I'm 14. 

I've been questioning my gender identity since 4th grade. For most of that time I identified as genderfluid. Over the summer of 2020 I came to the conclusion that I'm non-binary. The first person I told is my best friend, Iz (that's just what I'm calling him). Then I told my other best friend Kat (again just what I'm calling her).   
I'm beginning to feel like it's time to have a sit down with my mom about me being enby. I tried coming out to her in November, but she didn't exactly- get it. I feel like she thinks it's just a phase. I don't really know what to do about it. On top of that my step dad is extremely homophobic, and transphobic. I don't know what to do about that situation. Plus, my dad can read my messages with my friends and he already technically knows I'm non-binary, but he thinks I ""focus too much on it"". I'm actually just dysphoric and confused as to what the hell is happening most of the time.  
On top of that I feel like I can't count my self as non-binary cause of how feminine I am.. I don't mind my chest or how feminine my body is.. it feels wrong that I'm like that though ?  
If anyone has any tips on how to handle this please comment them- I'm so lost.

2021-01-19 22:30:05,l0v0wt,0,1,"**[TW: severe transphobia later on, will mark where it is in the post.]

So for context, I’m 15, identify as non-binary male, use he/they pronouns and am AFAB (sadly). I’ve been identifying as trans since I was 10 or 11. Though I have some memories of discomfort beforehand, I’ve mostly forgotten my life before then. My parents claim I never mentioned having dysphoria until I began puberty. I’ve socially transitioned to male and everyone refers to me by my chosed name and male pronouns, which feels much more comfortable and authentic.

However, recently I’ve began questioning my gender again. I’ve come to the conclusion, given my dysphoria and how much more at peace I feel living as male, that I’m unlikely to be female. But I don’t know if I’m non-binary or male. I genuinely can’t tell if I prefer he/him or they/them, they legitimately just both work fine with me. My dysphoria fluctuates, so I think that sometimes I lean male but sometimes I lean non-binary. But I never feel not male, just sometimes also non-binary.

Honestly... I don’t think I’m masculine enough to be binary male? I have pretty much every feminine trait that you can name and consider myself gender non-conforming. I’ve been told by people that I should want to be as much like a cis male as possible, rather than a soft, hairless, pretty anime boy (which I tend to envision myself as). So can I really be a transsexual male? I don’t want facial hair, body hair, large muscles... I don’t want to be what’s deemed “masculine”... I’d be so uncomfortable...

I wish I was cis male, then I’d be able to be as feminine or GNC as I’d like without being accused of being a trender or experiencing dysphoria. I legit just want to be a pretty boy. I want a male body, as in I’d really like to have a flat chest and penis but I’d also like slight curves, but in an androgynous male way, rather than having no gender? Though I think a genderless body would be cool, I feel most comfortable with a packer, so I think I’d be most comfortable with a penis, but just not... manly.

And I’m not sure I belong in male spaces either? **[TRANSPHOBIA]** I feel as if... I don’t belong there because I’m not *’really’* a guy, right? I’m a female-bodied person who *identifies* as male, and not even entirely male. How will they react, well, when they find out... I’m not “really” one of them? I feel like an imposter, a faker, someone hiding a serious secret from the rest of the group, as if I’m infiltrating male spaces and shouldn’t be accepted in them. I can’t tell if this means I’m NB or internally transphobic.

I’ve been seeing gender therapists at GIDS for around a year now but haven’t had the chance to mention this to them. And I wonder... is this really a medical issue? Could I not just be internally misogynistic? Am I just a gender non-conforming girl? Am I having my natural feelings pathologized?Why don’t I feel like I truly belong in male, female or enby spaces? I’m not planning on anything irreversible until I’m 18... not that I had any choice anyways. Is gender critical ideology getting to me?

I don’t know my gender... so I just identify as non-binary male because I consider myself to be between non-binary and male on a gender spectrum. I don’t know who I am, what I want, what I should do, how I should feel, what I want to identify as... I’m so lost. What should I do? I feel like if I don’t get on T soon, I won’t get the best results. I don’t want to be stuck in a female body... I’m scared to tell anyone... although some friends do... I don’t know what to do anymore. Plesse someone help me.",NonBinary,Do I sound non-binary?

(I’ve broken hair ties, brushes, combs, etc. And my hair flies sky high when it’s humid, like adding inches to my height high). For the majority of my life, I’ve never really taken the best care of my hair so it was always frizzy, not curly. In the past year or so, I’ve tried to take better care of my hair, mainly bc one of my closest friends is now a certified hairdresser and would actually kill me if I let it get super wild and damaged lol. My point is, I’m trying to take better care of it but all the advice and posts on social media surrounding curly hair are done by and for very VERY femme people, and mostly cis women. Hair care in general gives me major dysphoria now because I’m hyper aware of the hyper feminity attached to such an intricate hair care routine that my head would require. I mean, I already sleep with a bonnet to protect my curls overnight and that in and of itself took me like 3 days to feel neutral with and even still I’m not feeling great with it yet. Are there any other curly headed enby peeps out there who have any suggestions for ways to reduce the dysphoria around this or anything like that?

But last night, they told me something which I'm not quite sure what to feel about.

We talked about their non-binary identity and they admitted to me that they're thinking of having a total breast removal.

As a straight man, this brought up a lot of fears and worries within me.

It's a bit pointless to ask these questions now (afterall, I don't know whether it'll go anywhere or not), but I can't help but to think forwards. Would I still be attracted to them? Would it be harder to love them for it? I want to be supportive since it seems important to them, but at the same time, I cannot lie about my feelings.

2021-01-20 22:30:13,l1k9ta,8,2,"Long story short: I was harassed online in the comments of a youtube video.  

I made a comment making a joke regarding me being nonbinary, and someone kept commenting on that comment with absolutely hateful things along the lines of ""I don't support your lifestyle, biologically you will always be a boy or a girl, stop asking for special treatment, etc."", despite claiming that they were pro-LGBTQ.  I chose not to interact with any of their comments, though that didn't at all stop them from being worked into a frenzy by other's backlash to their comments. 

 I eventually decided to delete the parent comment altogether, but the damage was done.

I’m fat, and have been for most of my life, and most of my weight goes to my stomach and chest. My only issue is, outside of the dysphoria, I don’t have a super great relationship with my body. I have a lot of internalised fatphobia and a not-great relationship with food. For this reason, I’m aware that focusing on weight loss could be negative for me in regards to mental health, because currently I’m battling with the part of the that wants to lose weight because I hate my body (mostly because of its fatness) and not because I love it and want to be more comfortable in it. And every time I look into weight loss resources or journeys, there’s a lot of things that I find personally triggering – a focus on calorie counting, strict unsustainable diets, moulding your body to look like someone else’s/’body goals’, and just the overemphasis on appearance over health and sustainability. These things may work for some, but not for me. I also have depression, and have a lot of shame connected to exercise because I can’t do super intense workouts or ‘push myself’ as much as I seem to need to (barely any energy) and the very all-or-nothing approach to working out is just super discouraging to me. A strict regime of working out is never going to work for me because my mental health and ability to function fluctuates so often. Sometimes I can work out on a consistent schedule weekly, sometimes I can’t get out of bed.

With all that said, I’d really prefer advice on how to approach this in a flexible, forgiving, but still challenging way. I want to accept that my dysphoria is not something I can ‘self love and body positivity’ my way out of, and that it’s okay for me to want to feel more comfortable in my body via weight loss. But I also want to learn to deal with the self-loathing that doesn’t come from dysphoria and is instead internalized fatphobia – that part of me that says I can only be affirmed in my gender if I’m rail thin (because so much rep. of enbies is of the thin ones, which is a conversation in and of itself).

As I’m on this journey to become healthier and lose weight, how can I be more comfortable in my body now? If this is a journey you’ve been on, or something you struggle with, how do you do this? I don’t want to create an association between being thin and being happy/euphoric, because knowing how fucked my mental health already is, I don’t want to add disordered thinking about weight to the mix.

Here's the personal context I guess! I only recently came to the realization (haha summer 2020) that I was anything other than cisgendered, and it kind of, just a tad, made me reconsider everything about my life. I'm currently studying in a very conservative academic field, and I know that authority figures in the administration are TERFs. Being read as cis all the time is exhausting as heck, but it's not the safest space to come out in, or present more visibly queer, and I've been holding off. 

All this to say, I've been wrestling with the idea that to live out in the open as a nonbinary trans person, to avoid being misgendered constantly, I would have to come out in just about every new space I enter. There doesn't seem to be a way for nonbinary people to have their gender validated, and to be ""passing"" at the same time. Existing outside of the gender binary, and ""passing"" as cisgendered, frankly, seem inherently contradictory.

2021-01-21 15:43:14,l20vk2,10,1,"Hi everyone! I have some questions, please correct me if I say anything wrong here. I’m here to listen.

I’ve recently been questioning whether I’m gay after identifying as bi for a few years now. I think I am a lesbian but I’m also attracted to some non-binary people. This is my reasoning...

‘I’m attracted to cis and trans women and AFAB non-binary people, usually those who are on the more femme side but also more androgynous. I don’t think I’m attracted to AMAB non-binary people or those more masc presenting. Therefore I feel more comfortable identifying as gay/lesbian, because it communicates that I’m not attracted to masculine people.’

But at the same time I want to be sensitive and not being an asshole to people I don’t know everything about. I know there are non-binary lesbians and that nb covers a HUGE spectrum of gender expression. But I have a few questions and I’m going to ask them very broadly just to open the floor for a range of answers.

QUESTIONS:
-Generally, would a non-binary person feel it invalidates their gender for me to be attracted to them and call myself a lesbian? 
-If it does, how can I approach the subject to make them more comfortable and feel understood? 
-I feel it’s ok to id as lesbian for being attracted to femme people, despite some considering this to be bi. Do you feel this is right?

-Looking at a picture or video and being like “damn that’s really me like that’s me” or “I don’t look like me in that picture” or just like “I’m living and I’m so small and like there is a whole universe out there.” 

-Once a teacher wrote my name on the board (spelt it right) and I like zoned out and it took me a hot minute to realise that- that was my name. I like my name tho. I respond to it. I don’t want to change my name. Some people call me my full name and other my nick name, it only feels weird when someone that uses my nickname uses my full name. I had a weird obsession with the name Sam from iCarly lol.

-I used to look at my friends and seriously think like what it would be like to see from your eyes. I would be so fascinated by how they would see me and what it would be like in their body and how it feels to look through their lenses. I am a philosophical person.

They wanted to put their pronouns on their name tag, but asked if everyone would do they same out of solidarity and so that it wouldn’t “look weird” that only one person is doing it.

I am at a point in my life that I have felt heavily gender dysphoric after going through therapy and coming to grips with a traumatic childhood.  I am realizing I have never identified truly as male, even though I come off to many simply as a cis white male.  I have constant, complex feeling regarding my sexuality and gender identity that I am only just now questioning and coming to grips with.  I am only recently understanding the parts of myself I have hidden and tried to ignore for my entire life.

I don’t feel comfortable putting any sort of pronoun on my name tag because, I don’t want to make any sort of statement to the general public and my coworkers because I don’t even know how I feel yet.  The problem is, I am really afraid of coming across as not supportive or understanding.  It’s not that at all.

2021-01-22 18:01:50,l2t6yk,1,1,"Hi everyone, welcome to my ted talk ""Waking up scared and/or confused, and how to NOT deal with it""  
A lot of rambling ahead, so: sorry for that.

I've been out of the closet and confident about some things for the last 3 months or so.

Those things are: ""Spanish sucks"" (pretty gendered language), ""I am Enby"", ""I am stuck"".

So I came out to a lot of people both in my professional and personal life (I am 35 yo) and it's been quite a ride, not a lot of rejection, mostly people who don't know what to do/say and just don't talk to me unless necessary.

I am currently identifying as NB, and was looking into the mixture inside, if you point a gun to my head I'd said I'm agender, but really the ""Enby"" idea is just more comfortable, or instead of ""neutrois"" I'd go with the ""trois"" part only, like a third gender or something.

I´m thinking about changing my name, and it's been hellish, I'm thinking of getting a name that is more gender neutral/agedner and surprise, surprise: Spanish doesn't have any (or almost any) that fits; so I started to think about my family and where my parents come from, and my greatparents, and I've found that I don't know shit about my families past, and that sucks; it's mostly for political and/or cultural assimilation [r](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps)easons, I'm from Argentina, my fathers family is a circus/originary culture, and my mothers comes from a comunist/anarchist background that was prosecuted in the 60s and in the late 70s early 80s so a lot of what happened and such is a mystery, or the people that could tell me was ""vanished"" during the 80s military coup; but still I thought: ""maybe I can look up originary names and or italian/russian names"" but entered a neverending spiral of my name shouldn't be the first thing I recover from my cultural backgroud, I should investigate some other stuff, and also I don't identify as any of those things, and I don't want to end up feeding or justifying the cultural appropriation bullshit that is going around here so strongly (makes me so mad!!).  
So I am lost, I need a name, mine is characteristically male; and quite frankly never liked it that much.  
Where/how do you find names?  
As I write this I see how ridiculous my question is; I'm a scriptwriter that has also been playing tabletop RGP games for more than 2/3 of their life, why am I so insecure about this?

Now the bad part, I'm doign a lot of revisiting my life, and I had a quite dark/toxic phase for about 7 years, riding on a macho front on twitter, I still use that account but quite frankly I was ashamed back then and more so now, should I delete past posts? should I make a thread saying ""hey, I was a shitty macho, because I was so insecure, so yeah, I am battling my demons, sorry."" or should I just keep going and if something comes up in the future just own it and improvise on the fly there?

I'm kinda in a hurry looking for my name, I want to make a ""statement"" when I come back to work on middle feb, I want my name on the website and all the pronouns and stuff changed, and I don't care if I get fired (wich is a strong possibility) I have a back up or two, and also would go lawyering so hard, not so much for me but for my students, I teach at a university; I'll go swinging for them so hard, even for my shitty toxic masc tech students, they are just a reflection of the system, not the cause.

I am a bit confused and thinking about if I might be on the non-binary spectrum. But also maybe I'm not and it derives from something else? So I just wanted to ask if any of you share similiar experiences.  
I do not have body dysphoria and I have no problem with stereotipicaly female roles like being a stay at home mom or stuff.  
But I feel werid about some words? Also I'm Polish so english is my second launguage.

\- both english and polish words for woman feel weird

\- I don't really like the word girl in both either

\- now, I really like the word female, but unfortunately the closest word to it in polish can be only used for animals so it doesn't sound good anymore.

\- I don't have a problem with the word mom tho

And now I don't know if these are signs of being a bit on the non-binary spectrum (more towards female tho, like a demi girl or something) or maybe I have some problem with growing up? Because ""woman"" is a grown up. Maybe it has something to do with me being depressed, and I had a good childhood so maybe like I don't want to be an adult and maybe it's because of that? Or maybe because I'm on the autism spectrum and I dislike some words for no reason idk.

So because of this I've been considering using she/her and they/them pronounces in english (in Polish everything is gendered and there isn't really a neutral form that would be easy to use and I'm on with the femminine form)

One more note. I do like my femminine body and I like my clothes showing my shape. Tho also I do dress somewhat androgynously. And I have long hair, I was thinking about cuting it of but I'm too scared and too attached xD

So, I've recently figured out that I am nonbinary, agender in particular. Reading other posts here I'm starting to wonder if that is the perfect word for me, because many describe their being agender in a way I don't relate to. I know that each one lives this in a unique way, but still. Maybe agender is not the best word for me.

That being said, I am AFAB and I've always been mildly satisfied with that. I felt just fine with my being female and I never questioned my gender in any way. Until I asked myself ""how would I feel about being male?"" And the answer was ""quite the same as I feel about being female"".

Gender is not part of my identity and the way I see myself. So the point is not that I am neither M nor F, but that my gender doesn't say something about my identity, if that makes sense. That's why I am more comfortable with the term ""demigirl"" that with ""agender"", because I'm generally fine dressing and behaving like a girl, as I've always done. But even that one doesn't feel completely right.

I got a binder because I'd been looking forward to experimenting with gender expression since realizing I'm nonbinary. I'd very rarely if ever felt gender dysphoria. Up till recently, I'd never felt any chest dysphoria.

The moment I tried it on, I had two thoughts/feelings: ""It's not flat enough,"" and when I took it off, ""that doesn't look right.""

The first part is sort of something that's apparently somewhat common with plenty of other people who are new to binding, (especially for anyone with a larger chest that is difficult to flatten) and several of my friends assured me that nobody- not even cis men- are flat as a board. It may just be an issue that I got a half tank binder instead of a full tank. Looking forward to saving up for one in that style.

More importantly, I was much more surprised to suddenly not like what my chest looked like without a binder. I'd never really felt one way or another about my chest, it was just another part of me. I used to think ""why would someone want to bind for more than the recommended 8 hrs, or when sleeping, since it's unsafe and uncomfortable?""

She does make an effort to say “hey friend” in texts instead of “hey girl” so that’s nice. The other friend I haven’t seen in awhile, and I told her ahead of our get together that I am nonbinary and my pronouns are they/them.

2021-01-23 16:52:26,l3foo7,3,1,"Hi all! I'm a gender non-conforming she/they with BIG chest melons - we're talking 34I (yes, that's I, as in Ice cream or Icthyosaurus or the letter after H). I despise wearing bras. Despite extensive efforts to get the best fit possible, any bra that gives me any kind of meaningful support also causes me pain around either the chest band or the shoulder straps.

When I'm at home (cause pandemic) or doing a grocery run etc, I've gotten fairly comfortable with letting the fun bags fly free. Yes, the jiggle is noticeable, and I dgaf.  But there are situations (mostly work) where I need *some* level of control in order to make everyone else comfortable.

I'd like to try something tank top-shaped with sort of compression lite. Nowhere near enough to make my melons vanish (nothing short of surgery is going to do that), just enough so they don't wiggle so much as to draw every Karen's judgy gaze.

2021-01-23 18:08:22,l3h2ul,2,1,"A six months into our relationship, I told my boyfriend that I might be genderfluid. He said that he was okay with it. 

My hair used to be super long. However, during quarantine, I chopped it off to my shoulders. My boyfriend begged me not to cut it any shorter. I didn't do it until I broke up with him in November. On the one hand, it felt liberating. On the other hand, I had this awful, sinking feeling that having that swapping my boyfriend for androgyny (though that wasn't the reason that I broke up with him) hadn't been worth it, and I hated myself. 

We got back together the next week.

Over winter break, I told my writing club that I wanted to try ""they/he"" pronouns, because even though I was fine with ""she"", I didn't hear the other ones very often. Later, I added she/they/he to my instagram profile. 

A few days ago, my gender feelings jumped from a combination of ""vaguely not-woman"" and ""raging imposter syndrome"" straight into dysphoria territory. It's been pretty heavy. I have a sort of unofficial ""What if I'm trans?"" playlist, and that's been all I've been listening to in between aggressively projecting onto some of my more genderqueer OCs (as you do). 

Last summer, my boyfriend gave me a pair of jeans that were too tight for him. They fit me great, and though I wear them for different outfits, they become my go-to during dysphoric days like this. I sent him a meme, thanking him for the pants. He responded by starting a small discussion about me being open with him, and hinted that me being masc makes him uncomfortable. 

It kind of bothered me, and because I'm stupid, I decided to ""come clean"" about my pronouns. It's as honest as I can get. Basically, he is ok with ""they"" as long as he doesn't have to use it. He's not okay with ""he"" at all, even after I explained that it mostly exists because I typically prefer the masculine versions of things with no neutral alternative (ex. ma'am/sir, I prefer sir), and overall my stance is that descriptors are more about the energy than the gender. He didn't say it, but to me, it's clear that he's not even ok with me doing that, even if I keep it as far away from him as possible. Plus, he said that he doesn't like it when I dress masc. It kills me because 1) sometimes it be like that and 2) baggy jeans and a big sweater are comfortable and now I'm worried that this will be conflated with me being masc (which is what I was wearing yesterday).

It kills me, because even if some of this gets resolved, I can't be completely open. I can't joke about my gender the way I do with my close friends. I work to hide myself and redefine myself in ways that reassure him. I don't want to break up with him because otherwise, everything's great. However, I'm worried that this attitude may lead me to break off other parts of myself (like quitting my job or my apprehension toward giving birth). I don't understand why he can't just bury his discomfort with me like I do with his being religious (I grew up in a series of cult-like situations and have actual trauma from it). 

But I don't want to leave him again. The goal is to avoid depression. Either way, I'm screwed. And if I were to be fully out and start digging into identities more distant from my AFAB expectations, I risk losing friends, losing internships and career options, a relationship with my parents, and real potential for further romance in my life (more in part to already having deep trust issues after losing two close friends in 2019).

Little background info: I’m 30, transmac, on low dose T gel (20.25) daily. Hx of anxiety and PMDD (basically PMS on steroids) but no other health conditions to my knowledge. I’ve been gender nonconforming most of my life but due to growing up in a small town I never explored my identity until later in life. Decided I was non-binary and wanted to try low dose T to help alleviate some dysphoria/emotional imbalances. So far I’ve been on T for 1 week and here are some changes I’ve noticed: 

Mental: This has been the biggest change I’ve noticed and my favorite so far. I feel more calm and connected to my emotions than I did before I started. I used to let little things ruin my whole day but now I can separate myself from the emotion and change my mood pretty quickly. I feel a mind/body connect that I didn’t previously feel; I was chronically clumsy and felt like a floating head more than anything. Now I feel like a person with a physical and mental presence. 

Physical: I think the first thing I noticed here was my skin feeling slightly rougher/thicker and a little more oily. It’s not noticeable to others but I can feel it. No acne so far and I hope I can avoid that with my current skin care routine. My skin/muscles feel a little more firm. Body hair hasn’t really changed but I think my eyebrows seem a little thicker. I haven’t noticed any sweating and if anything I’ve been colder than usual but it’s freezing where I live so that could be contributing. My appetite has increased slightly and I can definitely eat more in one sitting. No voice changes but my throat does get dry and scratchy more easily. I believe bottom growth happened on day 2 and increase a small bit each day, nothing crazy though.

2021-01-24 03:45:22,l3rr9o,3,1,"Long post warning!

I'm totally new to Reddit and joined because I've been questioning my gender identity and wanted to learn more. 

I questioned my sexuality and gender identity for the first time when I was 22 (6 years ago) and pretty easily figured out I was bi, and began experimenting with my gender representation. 

Trying to present more masc/andro made me upset because the person in the mirror (to me) didn't look like a masc or andro person, they just looked like a girl playing dress up and I hated it. 

I never really had body dysphoria growing up (although I was upset to learn I'd grow up to be a woman as a kid) and always tried to just look like an attractive female person because I was female-shaped and that was easiest. Trying to be something else and not looking how I wanted made me feel worse, so I decided to ""commit"" to being female and got breast implants. 

I was happy with them for several years, but quarantine forced me to spend a lot more time on myself, mentally and physically, and after losing a bunch of weight I decided I preferred my more ""athletic"" look and wanted to get them removed, so I made an appointment with a doc. Basically at the same time all those same gender feelings started reemerging. 

 After a lot of thinking and stressing and journaling, I think I'm either nonbinary or trans, probably nonbinary but who knows, that could change. 

Long story short, in addition to the physical discomfort/proportion reasons, I also want them removed so I can bind and see how I feel with an actually fairly flat chest...

And surgery is the day after tomorrow!

I'm super excited but also it's weird because the recovery (drains, etc.) is very similar to top surgery and I feel like \*that's\* what I should be having, instead of a whole surgery just to get me back to what I started with. 

But either way, it's progress and change and I'm super excited to get reacquainted with my body.

When I first noticed that my boobs were big enough for my shadow to look feminine, I freaked. I was 13 and it was such a weird thing.  


For my high school graduation this summer I wore my suit. It's from the women's department but it's a bit big since I bought it when I was like 7kg heavier. I thought I looked androgynous, but when I looked at the pictures of me receiving my diploma, I looked like a woman. An attractive woman, the suit really makes me look wonderful if what you're looking for is a feminine silhouette.   


Someone asked a close friend of mine with whom I sometimes make out/flirt what she likes most about my body and she said it was my butt. I was very confused for a second. Which butt? I feel like a fat boy when I wear men's shorts because when men have a butt/hips like mine society looks down on them. Then I realized she looks at it from the other perspective. From the perspective of someone who is attracted to women. From that perspective, I am definitely attractive. It's just hard to look at myself that way on some days.

There are no good gender-neutral pronouns in our language and I already feel free to dress/wear my hair however I want. What would I gain from coming out as nb?

Am I still a valid nb person if only a handful of my closest friends know? I have one friend who is pretty much in the exact same position as me, they also got their hair cut short recently and they also feel like they are nb but like there is no point in coming out to anyone but our small group of LGBT+ friends who are kind and understanding.

Where I'm working off the baseline and I've already in this script draft: 

That ""trans"" and ""cis"" are both ✨Adjectives✨

What ""trans women"" and ""trans man"" means(because me and my sister has met trans people who were confused)

Given a baseline on what ""nonbinary"" is: an identity and an umbrella term, 
That it's common for them to use transmasculine/transfeminine When referring to their personal transition,
That some don't because it's not androgynous or unisex enough for them to feel comfy,
That's some don't even use the word trans Because they don't like it 😎 or they don't feel like they're welcomed to 💔

I have it written down in 1 of my notes but not yet in this script draft:

To briefly talk about ""transmedicalism"" and that it had good intentions but proved Toxic for the trans community.

Talk about ""Non-dysphoric"" and How they're valid.(might make a different video)

and that ""Gender identity"" ""Gender expression"" and ""pronouns"" Although usually Correlated, Don't have to and aren't defined by each other💕


So what do you think? Anything you think I need to add?

2021-01-24 22:06:29,l48vh8,0,1,"Hello everyone! 

This is a sincere question and I hoped this would be a good place to ask...

I was surfing YouTube when I stumbled upon a clip from ""Good Morning Britain"" called ""Should There Be a Limit to Gender Identities?"" Obviously, the whole topic gets ridiculed here and there is no real discussion. (I also did not watch the whole clip tbh)

I would consider myself a very tolerant and liberal person, but in the end I realised that I really don't know a lot about the concept of non-binary genders and I should educate myself more...

And that is why I want to ask you a few questions :)

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that sex and gender are different things. Sex is a biological concept whereas gender refers to social/psychological identity. 

I also have no trouble to understand transgender, it's still a binary system. Born as biological man, identifying as a woman (or the other way round) -&gt; transgender, easy (the concept, not he transition)!

&amp;#x200B;

So, ""non-binary"" literally means, there are not only two options for the gender to choose from. But what does it mean then? Are there many different ""categories"", e. g. multiple genders like the YouTube clip suggests? Or is it more like that there is not only black or white but a continuum of many shades of grey in between and no real ""categories""?

&amp;#x200B;

Both cases lead to more questions:  
Let's say there are multiple genders, what are examples of other genders than male or female? When I perform a Google search on that, I find lists of terms which I can simply not understand. 

For example (don't even know if it's a good example; from [https://www.healthline.com/health/different-genders#a-d](https://www.healthline.com/health/different-genders#a-d)) :   
\- **Aliagender** \- a nonbinary gender identity that doesn't fit into existing gender schemas or constructs  
\- **Aporagender** \-Both an umbrella term and nonbinary gender identity that describes the experience of having a specific gender that's different from male, female, or any combination of the two

First of all, for me both definitions are just paraphrasing each other!?! I cannot see any difference there! What am I missing?

Secondly, in my opinion, both of these terms don't even describe a gender either... This is why I ask for examples of different genders. Because I can understand, ""I identify as male"", ""I identify as female"", ""I identify as X or Y or Z or whatever"", but I don't get the ""I identify as SOMETHING SPECIFIC (but not clearly specified, also not male or female)"". Could this be anything? Like the stupid ""apache helicopter""!? I guess not!  

&amp;#x200B;

Let's assume the other option: the grey continuum between male and female.   
What determines how you identify?

I mean, I could be born as a biological male but really like to wear dresses or lipstick (or any other activity usually attributed to females). Would that be a non-binary identification? I assume, I would still identify as a man, but just also happen to like ""female things""?! 

At this point, I feel the need to repeat myself here: This is a genuine question. It's tough to grasp the feelings and challenges if you are not affected yourself. I don't want to ridicule anyone or anything. On the contrary, I want to get a understanding!

&amp;#x200B;

Agender is another term I usually read. To my understanding this refers to identifying neither as male nor female. Like the question before: How do you determine this? You don't apply typical male and female attributes to you, therefore you don't identify as any of these?

&amp;#x200B;

Which role does sexuality play in all of this? Does it play any role at all? 

&amp;#x200B;

And at last:  
What do you as a person or you as a community wish for? What can I do for you to feel more accepted? Is this mostly a matter of language (correct use of pronouns)? Other than that, I cannot think of any difference in how I would even notice a difference between a non-binary and binary person...   
Gender correct language would of course be a whole new point... I am not a native English speaker as you might have guessed ;) This should not really be discussed here...

Cheers!",NonBinary,[Serious] What does non-binary really mean?,1611551189.0,"{'created_utc': 1611525989, 'id': 'l48vh8', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Hello everyone! \n\nThis is a sincere question and I hoped this would be a good place to ask...\n\nI was surfing YouTube when I stumbled upon a clip from ""Good Morning Britain"" called ""Should There Be a Limit to Gender Identities?"" Obviously, the whole topic gets ridiculed here and there is no real discussion. (I also did not watch the whole clip tbh)\n\nI would consider myself a very tolerant and liberal person, but in the end I realised that I really don\'t know a lot about the concept of non-binary genders and I should educate myself more...\n\nAnd that is why I want to ask you a few questions :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand that sex and gender are different things. Sex is a biological concept whereas gender refers to social/psychological identity. \n\nI also have no trouble to understand transgender, it\'s still a binary system. Born as biological man, identifying as a woman (or the other way round) -&gt; transgender, easy (the concept, not he transition)!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, ""non-binary"" literally means, there are not only two options for the gender to choose from. But what does it mean then? Are there many different ""categories"", e. g. multiple genders like the YouTube clip suggests? Or is it more like that there is not only black or white but a continuum of many shades of grey in between and no real ""categories""?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoth cases lead to more questions:  \nLet\'s say there are multiple genders, what are examples of other genders than male or female? When I perform a Google search on that, I find lists of terms which I can simply not understand. \n\nFor example (don\'t even know if it\'s a good example; from [https://www.healthline.com/health/different-genders#a-d](https://www.healthline.com/health/different-genders#a-d)) :   \n\\- **Aliagender** \\- a nonbinary gender identity that doesn\'t fit into existing gender schemas or constructs  \n\\- **Aporagender** \\-Both an umbrella term and nonbinary gender identity that describes the experience of having a specific gender that\'s different from male, female, or any combination of the two\n\nFirst of all, for me both definitions are just paraphrasing each other!?! I cannot see any difference there! What am I missing?\n\nSecondly, in my opinion, both of these terms don\'t even describe a gender either... This is why I ask for examples of different genders. Because I can understand, ""I identify as male"", ""I identify as female"", ""I identify as X or Y or Z or whatever"", but I don\'t get the ""I identify as SOMETHING SPECIFIC (but not clearly specified, also not male or female)"". Could this be anything? Like the stupid ""apache helicopter""!? I guess not!  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet\'s assume the other option: the grey continuum between male and female.   \nWhat determines how you identify?\n\nI mean, I could be born as a biological male but really like to wear dresses or lipstick (or any other activity usually attributed to females). Would that be a non-binary identification? I assume, I would still identify as a man, but just also happen to like ""female things""?! \n\nAt this point, I feel the need to repeat myself here: This is a genuine question. It\'s tough to grasp the feelings and challenges if you are not affected yourself. I don\'t want to ridicule anyone or anything.

So, i am female, or at least afab...

Also, I've always tried to hide my breasts with some slimming bras, hoddies and so on. And again, it just feels uncomfortable.

QueerSome Isle is a new Discord server for all 18+ years old individuals that do not identify as cisgender. We intend to create a friendly and safe community for non-cis folx, foster political and social justice related debate, and offer peer support for gender related issues. Peer support is aimed at helping people who are questioning their gender or in any stage of their gender journey. You can share your experience with people who are just starting out their transition and get advice from peers who are already further ahead on the path. Our goal is to remain a small and off-grid server, and invite new members through personal invites only, so that we can create a united and active community. 

Considering the server is brand new, we are looking for folx who are interested in joining our staff team. We are very flexible regarding time commitment, if you’re passionate about helping non-cis people and interested in being a central part of a new, kind and supportive community we’d love to have you onboard!

I would so much rather do the boys one with the hanging rings and pummel horse things. I absolutely would have done gymnastics if I could’ve don’t the boys one. 
It should be divided as “Gymanstics 1” and “Gymanstics 2” or something. Not girls and boys. 

And Lacrosse. Boys lacrosse have helmets and shoulder pads and things because they take into each other. Girls Lacrosse is short skirts and tank tops with small goggles for the eyes because they don’t ram into each other and have physical contact like that. 


Sports like those are completely ridiculous to be divided by gender when the gender ones are so different. 


But then sports like soccer, basketball, etc. I kind of get because traditionally women and men have different body types and it’s kind of not fair to have a dozen people with a dozen different body types competed for the same thing against each other. But it’s still stupid.

Good Afternoon all! 

I am questioning if I am Nonbinary or not. Here are the facts.

- I am Pansexual, this is something i find comfort in but struggled with in the past

- I am a “masculine looking” male, albeit a bit on the short and skinny side.

- I do not fit into the “Alpha Male” persona at all. As a matter of fact, I do not solely identify with “masculinity” at all outside of my looks.

- I am in a a traditionally hetero relationship. However, my girlfriend and I have a very fluid dynamic in the relationship where the roles change frequently. She is also bi and has questioned using they/them pronouns in the past 

- I don’t particularly identify as solely feminine either.

---

I was a tomboy growing up, secretly wishing to be a real boy. My family and friends thought that meant I was a lesbian, even though I was never attracted to girls. I guess that's not an unfamiliar story to this community. Especially among us who are older and/or raised conservatively.

At 23 I married my first love. He was tall, strong, hairy, a real masculine bear of a man. When he held me in his arms, I felt like a woman, in a way that felt right. In a way that I never felt in any other interaction with people, or clothing, or interests. I learned to love myself, to accept and be happy in the body I had.

When I became more aware of trans people and other rainbow topics, I wondered if I was a trans man. Or if I had been born ten years later, would I have identified that way as I came of age. I had a good life though, and no need to rock the boat. Life's easier as an odd cis het woman married to a cis man right?

Some years later, with more awareness and education, and better skills at examining myself, I ventured into the topic again. My husband was incredibly supportive, telling me he'd love me no matter what I decided was right for me. I tried on some different labels, read stories here and on r/ainbow and so on. 

I settled into NonBinary being the right label for me. I didn't care what pronouns people used. Or the masculine or feminine form of my name. It was all me, and I was happy in who I was. It felt right wearing boxers and a bra, living fully in the grey area between man and woman.

And then my world crashed. My husband was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and passed away in our home last summer. He was my person I talked to about everything. My childhood trauma. My office politics. My gender struggles. Everything going on in the news. And even his impending death. 

---

And now I'm back to figuring out who I am and what I do with my life. I'll still be working through my grief for some time, but I'm also lonely. I live in the moment now, because long term planning is impossible. 

I met someone through friends a couple months ago. It's early, and we're having a casual fling. He's very different than my husband, but I feel comfortable and safe with him too. I right away felt like a carefree teenager, able to forget the rest of the world and be happy, but there's more than that. When I'm with him, I feel like a boy too. Like how I was an honorary boy in elementary school, catching frogs and playing football. It feels right.

And I don't know where to begin on sharing any of this with him. Or even if I should. I know he's open-minded and unconventional, in contrast to most of our friend group being accepting yet not understanding of any rainbow things. When it came up that he's bi and dates guys too, I was unphased but other friends had that awkward curiosity like he was a zoo animal or alien.

Also, AMAB here.

So I think the biggest example is that if I told someone that I like wearing dresses, it's difficult to predict what they will picture. It was only 60 to 70 years ago that lots of wives at least in the media I'll wore the same style of dress so if you say I want to wear dresses to some people they're going to picture that kind of a dress right away. 

so I guess for me personally I should just pick one style that I like and say that I like that.

Like if I say oh I really like wearing sheath dresses or but I dress professionally I might wear a pencil skirt or when I dress casually I might wear a sweater dress. I found some pretty comfortable boots with heels. I own a pair of pink yoga pants (okay that's one might be TMI for anyone). 

so at this point as I'm talking through it I know it might sound like I'm trying to make it seem like these things can be masculine which if you want to take it that way that's no problem.

Lately I've seriously been thinking about coming out to my mom. She has never expressed transphobic or homophobic sentiments for as long as I can remember. But she is 65 and considering how much terminology and trans/non-binary identity has evolved and changed in the past couple decades, I don't know that she'll fully understand what I mean when I say ""I'm non-binary; my pronouns are they/them."" I think her conceptions and terminology will be more reflective of what was in vogue during the 70's 80's and 90's and that she won't be fully aware of contemporary 21st century terms and concepts. 

I'm not worried that she will reject me. I'm almost certain she will accept me with open arms. I just worry she won't fully understand my identity. In particular, I worry she may struggle with they/them pronouns. 

I'm going to do my best to explain it to her. But I know there are much smarter people out there who can explain things far better than me.

Monday my best friend came over to cut off my super long quarantine hair and gave me a quintessential short masc haircut and I am reveling in how androgynous I look. I'd been feel pretty down about my appearance but apparently I just needed less hair. 

I pretty much live out of a comfortable sports bra and only where a ""real"" bra when I specifically want to ""look like a girl"".

I talked to my therapist about having gender feelings and she pointed out that the things I described could just be Preferances rather than gender indicators. I agree; there's a lot to unpack. But she seemed kind of dismissive.

I'm turning 30 this year and my whole life I've assumed I was just bad at being a girl. In my early 20s I did experiment a little with my gender presentation but nothing came of it- not that I didn't enjoy looking masc/andro sometimes. I was just too busy surviving my early 20s.

I am so glad you find comfort and strength in being a woman. For me, though, the label of woman has always felt like an impossible standard that I could never meet. You’re graceful, impossibly naturally elegant, and beautiful; I’m homely, awkward, and loud. My testosterone levels are closer to a biological male than female. I grow a beard, a mustache, and chest hair. The threat of balding constantly lurks at the back of my mind. 

I acknowledge that I am biologically female. I agree with the post that you shared saying that doesn’t mean long hair and all things traditionally feminine. If our society didn’t have expectations on people based on their assigned sex at birth I wouldn’t have to consider myself non-binary to gain more self acceptance. The societal expectations are definitely diminishing, but they haven’t disappeared. Would you ever consider switching the twins’ wardrobes? Would you make judgements if one of your male friends showed up in a cocktail dress for a night out on the town? Even if you wouldn’t personally have an issue lots of people in society would. 

Until those societal expectations are abolished and we make no suppositions about a person’s preferred activities, colors, fashion, and lifestyle based upon their chromosomes or genitals there has to be a place for the outliers to exist comfortably. For those with hormonal imbalances like me. For those who are genetically or physically intersex. For those who for whatever reason feel confined or less than by a gender binary. 

A world that allows for more identity, at least in my eyes, can only help the marginalized and disenfranchised. You are free to be proud to be a woman. Embrace the power your womb has to create life! I never want to take that away from you if you draw strength from it. The only thing I found in it was judgement. That I wasn’t enough. 

A few years ago I found out about non-binary identity. It was a label that didn’t have suppositions on appearance or behavior. Suddenly I found an identity where how I am is totally okay. I can be non-binary and wear a tiara. Or grow out my mustache. Or be hairless from head to toe. I can relish in a good MMA beat down and geek out about sexy cars. It’s made such a difference in how I relate to myself and the comfort I feel in my own skin. 

If I would never want to take away your feeling of power in your identity, why would you want to take mine?",NonBinary,I am trying to work up the courage to send this to someone who shared a hurtful post on FB.

So, I  am somewhat older (30s -- I mean ""older"" for online communities, at  least in my experience), and in my community coming up, there was no  such thing as talking about gender, so be gentle, I'm still learning  about this stuff.

I was assigned  male at birth, and assumed I was a cis man all my life until recently.  As I've become more active online, I've gotten to know people who are  trans.

I watched a recent video from a Trans influencer named Arrows. He talked about how he went to go get a root canal and the dentist did not know how to address him. This prompted a question I want to ask...

A dentist office has a patient registry with each patient’s name, address, and known dental history. Would there be value in that registry also having two additional data points: preferred gender pronouns &amp; gender? For the gender column, would these categories: FTM, MTF, Intersex, Cis Female, Cis Male, Nonbinary be appropriate or would you have a different list? Of course I know the dentist doesn’t need to know your gender but I’m wondering if adding those two extra data points would be helpful in terms of going to a doctor to do a physical check up for instance?",NonBinary,Ally here!

Hey everyone :) I’m a trans woman who has been with my partner for about five years. I transitioned with them and recently they have been sharing with me some questions, doubts and experiences regarding their experience of their gender, specifically that they feel they are gravitating towards “non binary” as a category they feel comfortable with.

They are a bit confused because they’re not sure whether they don’t feel related to their assigned gender and in general cis experiences because of their proximity with my experience as a trans woman. They don’t experience physical dysphoria but sometimes some slight social dysphoria when being gendered as a girl by other people, at some other times they are fine with it. No body dysphoria either but they do experience body euphoria, especially when packing and when we explore sexual experiences together where they have a penis. 

Ive told them that cis people don’t consistently question their gender, but I think that they are a bit confused because there is not a lot of representation of non binary people who may feel euphoria from packing and such but without that experience being understood as a “trans masculine” experience. They also experience euphoria when someone says they’re a handsome boy, or that they are giving enby hottie vibes etc. 

I’m mainly trying to show them others peoples experiences and affirming comments that will help in their experience of exploring their gender Identity.",NonBinary,"Partner exploring gender identity, looking for supportive and affirming experiences for them",1611888484.0,"{'created_utc': 1611863284, 'id': 'l76nyj', 'num_comments': 3, 'score': 2, 'selftext': '\nHey everyone :) I’m a trans woman who has been with my partner for about five years.

I’m just so sick of not being understood or respected. Nobody understands how awful dysphoria can really be. From the minute I wake up until the minute I finally collapse I feel awful, my skin is loose and baggy yet suffocatingly tight at the same time, my long hair is strangling me every time I see it, I can barely even function. I mean, I’m here ranting to strangers just to cope. When I found out I couldn’t earlier today I waited until I was alone and basically broke down to the damn dog weeping and sharing all of my problems. Yes, I know that a binder isn’t a permanent solution and yes I know it can be unsafe if not used carefully, but that goes for any helpful treatment! It feels like my family (the two damn people I’m out to, my dad is horrifically transphobic) think that I just want a binder to fit in with other non binary people or something. I can’t keep dealing with this.

My partner is there for me thank god, but emotional support can only do so much.

I can’t just not ever bind, it’s impossible for me, I’ll end up grabbing a belt or something. I’ve done it before. She seems to think that denying me something I need just to feel semi okay in my body sometimes is just going to be totally okay.

I can’t get a binder from friends since the only people I’m out to have parents who would see it. Even if they didn’t, there’s a fucking pandemic so I can’t even get my hair cut. I know she just wants the best for me, but it sure as hell feels as though she doesn’t support me. She deadnames me a lot and uses the wrong pronouns even when my dad isn’t around, I know it’s just her forgetting but these little things add up. It’s hard.

I contemplate opening a line of pharmaceuticals targeted at anybody, especially young males, who desire ""de-masculinization"".

\-- A de-masculinizing product!

Is it a feminizing product?

Not really.

Feminizing product, to me, says more like estrogen, which leads to feminine body fat allocation and gynecomastia.

Not everybody wanting to de-masculinize wants to chance gynecomastia.

So is it an antiandrogen?

It's more than an antiandrogen!

I'm talking about dihydrotestosterone inhibitors, namely finasteride and dutasteride.

D.H.T.-inhibitors not only block androgens (albeit to a lesser extent compared to other antiandrogens such as spironolactone), but D.H.T.-inhibitors work by blocking the body's conversion of the hormone testosterone into its more potent and more masculinizing metabolite, D.H.T.. These D.H.T.-inhibitors also have a minute feminizing effect in the same manner as estrogen, but to a much lesser extent. Thus, gynecomastia is mitigated if not absent. Additionally, D.H.T.-inhibitors are known to have permanent de-masculinizing effects when taken for long enough.

Put simply, imagine a highly effective and efficient pharmaceutical product that will permanently make you less masculine -- without wiping out your T-levels, without unwanted side-effects, without feminization, and with little chance of gynecomastia.

Such is dutasteride, I know. I've been taking dutasteride at least every week for months, now, and, as predicted, I've observed in myself appreciable de-masculinization, minimal feminization, and a complete absence of side-effects.

This stuff is safe, and I have a lot of experience with pharmaceuticals. I checked and it's not easy to overdo it, and it's potent enough to not worry about underdoing it.

How magnificent!

Again, it's a very safe pharmaceutical that can be taken over time to \*permanently\* de-masculinize oneself so they can be who they want to be.

I haven't tried finasteride, but it's so similar to dutasteride, I imagine it must be very similar. I believe finasteride is less potent and less efficient, however, which still could have uses, say, as a de-masculinization ""trial"" item.

Currently, these particular substances have applications in mitigating prostate cancer and male pattern hair loss. They have also been used in transgender hormone therapy as antiandrogens.

Now I have discovered this new purpose that some people could desire.

Disclaimer: I am not advocating people go out and try something that could harm them or cause regret. Restrictions apply, results may vary.

But I just wanted to let you lot know about this and my experience with it.

2021-01-30 02:21:30,l8bej3,1,1,"My whole facebook feed exploded in joy, I thought you might enjoy a bit of good news.

My province, a heavily catholic province (Quebec), passed a law that trans people and non-binary people can now change all of their documentation to match their gender identity. Documents includes, changing the gender on the birth certificate, medical card or whatever documents you have to the identity you identify as.

It includes M, F and X.

Non-binary parents can also mention themselves as 'parent' instead of 'mother' or 'father' on their kids' birth certificate.

Teenagers also do not require a letter from a medical/psychological professional anymore to apply for changing their gender officially. Parents can still deny a name change though.

This law also applies to non-Canadian citizens, like refugees, permanent residents and people without status.

The argument was that not including those rights was removing rights to trans and non-binary people and would only cause harm to citizens that are as important and valid as anyone else.

2021-01-30 05:01:29,l8ece7,2,1,"Hello! I am new to Reddit and identifying as non-binary and just looking for some support. I guess it’s more of a rant so apologies in advance.

I’ve always felt some sort of “off” about my gender, or rather, my presentation/expression. I am AFAB and in general haven’t minded using she/her or being called a woman. I have identified as a lesbian for the last 7 years and feel pretty comfortable with that community. 

For years I couldn’t quite find my footing. I dressed fairly feminine in hs, a mix in college before slowly skewing more towards masculine clothes, but that didn’t feel right either. In the last few years, I’ve been more comfortable in the middle, dressing slightly more androgynous. I am definitely read as a cis woman, maybe a lesbian if anything. 

I’ve had thoughts and quirks for years that I either didn’t notice or thought they were crazy. Every time I try on an outfit or a new piece of clothing for many years I instinctively compress my boobs to my chest to see what it would look like flat chested, and immediately feel relieved. I am so envious of men with flat chests and women with small boobs. I recently bought a compression bra that has felt amazing, but I think I’ve resisted wearing only binders/sports bras because it doesn’t make me feel sexy and also maybe makes me feel less desirable as a lesbian (?). I can’t tell if my desire to be feminine is genuine or because it’s how I’ve seen myself and wanted to be seen by partners.

But when I would see boys who dressed feminine, that was when I felt the strongest desire and admiration, but not in a romantic way necessarily. But I thought it was crazy to be a woman who wanted to be a feminine boy/andro person. And I was confused because I thought to myself, “if I like looking feminine, why does it feel so goddamn uncomfortable when I do it now? Why do I want to wear a bra with a flat chest but hate wearing one now?” I came to the conclusion (helped immensely after reading posts where others felt the same) that when I dress feminine now, I’m read and see myself as a cis woman, whereas I’m most comfortable being seen as an androgynous, non binary person who can embody masculinity and femininity at different times to different degrees. 

The thing I have been most stuck on right now is the thought of top surgery. The only reason I’ve come to all these realizations in the first place is I let myself imagine getting a breast reduction, and the thought of top surgery crept into my head, and I frantically googled things like “lesbians getting top surgery” to try to figure things out. But if I got a breast reduction all I could imagine was the doctor telling me how small they could make my boobs and feeling disappointed that my chest wouldn’t be flat.

When I came out as a lesbian, I actually came out as bi. Not because I was attracted to boys, but because I felt like it gave me some remnant of heteronormativity and I was scared of just being a full-blown lesbian and the shame associated with it. Later, I couldn’t even imagine why I did that, I was so comfortable and grateful to be gay. I’m worried I’m doing the same thing now— I’m fighting the idea that I could actually be non-binary and might want top surgery because it just feels too overwhelming, even though it also feels right. I never have overwhelming chest dysphoria— on good days I can recognize that I look beautiful, but they still just feel like they’re just “there”, not a part of me. But while i don’t hate my boobs all the time, when I get dressed, I’ve really never once enjoyed how I look with my boobs showing even the slightest. There are so many things, including feminine things, I think I would love to wear with a flat chest. Also, in a weird way, top surgery just feels like it would restore my body to “neutral”, like a blank canvas I could do anything with. I think I would even love having longer hair more with a flat chest. 

I think part of my issue is the trans narrative that is perpetuated that you have to hate your body to want surgery. I don’t mean to dismiss anyone who feels extreme dysphoria, but I think a part of my brain feels like I’m not trans enough for it, or that I have to despise myself to want change, which I know logically isn’t true. But I guess a tiny part of me is worried about regret? But when I think about it, I’ve spent so much more time being envious and fantasizing about a flat chest than I have really genuinely loving my boobs (probably a sign that I used to wish I had a medical reason to get a mastectomy bc then I could get the surgery without explaining anything).

I know it’s nothing I have to decide right now, but I’m feeling overwhelmed thinking about it, and the fact that I haven’t really come out to anyone. I’m lucky in that I know everyone who I care about will support me, but I think I’m most worried about telling my gf. Even telling her about a breast reduction was difficult, and she said she’d support me but (half jokingly) as long as I didn’t go all the way and remove them. I think she was worried (speaking generally) about a partner transitioning to a trans man (which I’m not), so I’m not sure how she’d feel about me being NB, but I’m worried it won’t align with her lesbian identity. It’s hard bc I still want to ID as a lesbian, or soft butch or whatever, which I know I can, but it’s more complicated in a relationship.

If you’ve read this far, I’m very impressed, this is the first time I’ve put all these thoughts down. All I can say is, after finding a few non binary people on Instagram and desperately searching for people who looked the way I imagined myself, and found this Reddit and the beautiful pictures people post and the words written I thought only existed in my head and the support people give each other, my heart has swelled immensely.

So I'm not a big reddit user but I'm hoping this is okay to post here/hoping I'm doing this right. Apologies if I'm not.

I'm a 30 yr old afab being and I think I'm agender and/or nonbinary. 
I have struggled with mental illness, regular panic attacks and anxiety, and chronic depression for a long time. I've never been thin, always a little chubby, have the boobs and the tum, and I'm really struggling with my self hatred and low self worth when it comes to just simply not looking like who I think I am. Who I feel I am. I have no idea who I am or what would make me comfortable.
I've been wearing the same clothes for like 15 years, t-shirts hoodies and jeans, and I'm the heaviest I've ever been. 
I'm at a point where I don't want to be seen at all, I'm ashamed and embarrassed to know that people see me. I haven't been able to share a selfie online in over a year because I just hate them all and it just doesn't look like how I feel. 
""Mens"" clothes appeal but don't fit right cause of my bumpy body and ""womens"" clothes are too feminine/tight, so I don't know what I should be wearing or how to wear it or how I can feel less dysphoria and dysmorphia. The weight just makes all my clothes too tight so I'm constantly uncomfortable, and I just feel ugly and gross in my skin.

Sorry for the downer post, just trying to give context. I'm really just looking for advice and resources for someone that's not skinny that wants to wear non form fitting /non gendered clothes.
Thin people wearing non form fitting clothes look cool but I look out of proportion and wonky.

Also, always looking for new queer folks to follow for inspiration.

So, I've recently discovered that I'm Nonbinary, I've only come out to a few close friends and they're all very supportive thankfully. But after my discovery of me being Nonbinary, I've started to want to cover up my chest more. 

I've never really been the kind of person to be shirtless, even at the local swimming pool I'd wear a rashguard. But its never been anything I've been insecure about until I discovered I was an enby. I'm AMAB and I was born without any breasts but I still feel very exposed and try to cover my chest whenever I'm shirtless. I don't feel Dysphoric about my chest I just feel the need to cover it.

Does anyone else have this? It doesn't bother me, I'm willing to adapt to this new change but I just wanna know if any other enby feels this way. I feel more feminine btw if that helps, I feel like that could contribute.

Thank you so much!

I just have a lot of Thoughts right now and would like to throw them into the void and maybe see if anybody else has had similar thoughts and what conclusions they came to.

I've been out to myself for about four years now, and out to other people for a year, and am now considering more of a medical transition. I am like 95% sure this is what I want to do, but I'm so worried about that 5% of uncertainty.

I'd say 2.5% is the fear of regret. So many binary trans people say they have known since they were very young, like 5 years old, that they were trans, but I've only been out to myself for like 4 years. I can totally look back into my childhood and note some obviously trans/non-binary feelings too, but for the majority of it I guess I was fine presenting as my AGAB, so I'm worried that this want to transition further is something I might grow out of?

The other 2.5% of doubt is that I want to do this to be perceived differently by other people. Not that there's anything wrong with wanting to alleviate social dysphoria this way, but I'm just worried medically transitioning bc of what other people think of me could be a bad reason. I am just so Tired™️ of being perceived as my AGAB and not being taken seriously after coming out to (some) people. 

But on the other hand, I want to do this so I can actually look at my body in the mirror. And not freak out when I look down in the shower. And so I feel comfortable singing in front of other people. And so I can actually enjoy exercising again. And so I don't just immediately crawl in bed and shut myself off from the rest of the world when it's time to take my binder off.

That's it, idk what to make of all this, but thank you for listening.

the problem arose last night, when my friend introduced me to some of HIS queer circle in person, and he was introducing me as the new name, and it just felt weird, it never felt like people were talking to ME. i don’t know if that means the new name i tried out just isn’t the right name, OR if it means i like my original name and want to keep it. my roommate doesn’t know about my identity yet, so i still hear my original name a lot and it doesn’t make me uncomfortable??

i also hear she/her pronouns a lot which don’t make me uncomfortable. in fact, whenever people refer to me as “they” (which IS what i requested) it, again, feels like they’re not referring to me at all...

and i’ve seen on other posts people say that if i want to be non-binary, i am, and i don’t have to prove my identity by preferring they/them pronouns or preferring androgynous looks or preferring a new name, but it just seems like there’s a running tally of things counting AGAINST me for this identity.

Basically the title, wondering where to go from here. 

Backstory: So, I’ve been considering a reduction for a very long while. I never considered top surgery, because masculinization of the chest always felt a little weird to me. I’ve already consulted a doctor, and I found out that the lowest I can go through a reduction is a B or C. That really triggered a lot of dysphoria, and I wasn’t sure how to name why I was feeling that way. 

After someone on here responded to my ask for YouTube recommendations, I started watching copshatemoe. I just (right now loll) looked into top surgery like seriously, and I think that actually may be the best option for me. I actually felt a sense of euphoria thinking about a flat chest, which I never thought I would feel. I honestly am realizing that I’m more masc aligned than I thought, and that’s so scary for me! 

I’m wondering: what now? How can I get to a place where top surgery is possible? Do I need to get diagnosed with dysphoria? I’m so lost... I never considered “transitioning” before.

Their response to constant misgendering was essentially that they got over it, accepted their body as 'female', realized that most people don't know what genderqueer is and understandably see them as female and therefore didn't deserve frequent correcting about pronouns (including close people like family). A lot of people in the comments agreed by saying they felt the same way. None of that in and of itself really bothered me but there seemed to be this consensus that asking people to use your correct pronouns and correcting them and actually feeling hurt or caring about being misgendered was being 'demanding?'. Or like social dysphoria, which is the kind of dysphoria I primarily experience, is equivalent to being insecure and whiny and that you just need to get over it and stop putting so much pressure on people. That somehow being AFAB and feminine means that you just have to accept that most people will call you 'she' and stop feeling bad about it because you obviously place too much value in what others think of you and you aren't owed the respect of using the correct pronouns if you look feminine and are AFAB - it's too confusing for cis people to see someone who looks like a woman not using female pronouns.  

And the thing is - on a certain level, in certain situations, that may be something you have to accept. If you are feminine and AFAB most people will call you she or misgender you. Even androgynous nonbinary people deal with this. Coping with being misgendered long term is just a part of being nonbinary, unfortunately. But to me there's a ginormous difference between acknowledging that society is like this as a result of misunderstanding, ignorance and transphobia, and that it is something you have to cope with vs. framing it in a way that makes nonbinary people seem immature or demanding for wanting to be seen and understood as what they actually are. Cis people receive that understanding, heck even binary trans people can get that because a lot of people can wrap their head around binary genders. So how the fuck is it demanding or unfair for nonbinary people to want this too?? Is it our fault society just doesn't understand us?? 

It's not my fucking fault I have a gender that's so strange and bizarre to so many people. It's not my fucking fault that there is no visual way to present as my gender, and that transition into a body that will get me acknowledged as what I actually am seems impossible. I didn't choose to be this way. And some days I'd kill to be a cis woman who could just take this shit for granted, or even a nonbinary person who just didn't care, or even a nonbinary person who had only body dysphoria and pursued gender affirming healthcare for themselves and not because they wanted people to percieve them in a particular way. But I'm not that. I'm *this*. And hearing that correcting people on pronouns, or feeling hurt, is somehow immaturity or insecurity or whatever other bullshit personality flaw they made it out to be, hurt so much. ESPECIALLY today. Like it already hurts enough to have cis people treat you like you're demanding and like you don't make sense just for being the way you naturally are. But to hear that rhetoric coming out of other nonbinary people's mouths really fucked me up. It made me feel like I wasn't allowed to exist the way I am, with all the emotions I have about my situation and not being gendered correctly. It made me feel oversensitive and stupid for what is ultimately me just wanting people to address me correctly. It made me feel irrational for being an AFAB who looks feminine and doesn't like being called a woman. Like because I'm too complex to make sense to cis people, I just don't make sense at all.

Yes I understand that we need to be understanding and patient of others when they get it wrong. And I understand that over time, it might be productive to find better ways to express these emotions or find ways to become more resilient and thick skinned about  being misgendered. Lots of nonbinary people choose to pick their battles and are just out to people close to them or don't even change their pronouns. That's fair. Not everyone wants to invest all their energy into correcting and teaching people. But some of us can't do that (because dysphoria, etc), don't want to, and just feel it is worth it to push for nonbinary visibility or to have the right to live as openly as any other gender. Like I said cis people get their gender respected and acknowledged, so why they fuck shouldn't we? How is it demanding too much when *we* do it? How else does change come about? (Not directed at all people who do this, I'm in the same situation but) Stay closeted or keep your pronouns if you want, but don't fucking tell other nonbinary people that they are being demanding or whiny because they struggle with something you don't or want to live openly.

To end - I didn't need to hear that when I was already hurting. Gaslighting today of all days. And that's what it is - being gaslighted into thinking that because I'm too 'complicated' for cis people to understand, I'm simply not allowed to have those emotions. That it's *unreasonable*. Like a binary trans person who is cis passing can ask for their correct pronouns, and have them respected no problem, but I can't because that's too """"""confusing""""""?

I just need someone to tell me I'm not insane for being angry or struggling so much with social dysphoria and a disconnect between my gender and my body that can't be majorly solved by transition. I need someone to say that I make sense even if I'm AFAB and wear feminine clothing and don't like being seen as a woman. That that *isn't* unreasonable, that cis people need to expand their understanding of gender instead of me having to shrink to fit it. That as a trans nonbinary person I'm *allowed* to take up space.
