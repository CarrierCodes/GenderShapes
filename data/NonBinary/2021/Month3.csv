so yesterday I came out to my mum (I didn't expect to do it, it was very impulsive hahsadfj) and she was very nice and accepting. Thing is, now that I've done that, I can finally start to think about transitioning and I am very overwhelmed. I'm an amab enby, and if I had to give myself a more specific label it would be bigender. (but I dont really like going by that, usually just ""enby""). Eitherway my point is that id like to be transfem. However I feel very overwhelmed about making a choice like that, I mean, taking hormones (which will be my ""main"" transition, that is to say, I wont be doing bottom surgery or anything) is a huge thing and im really worried I will regret it. I dont feel much dysphoria, only sometimes and I feel euphoria when I present more fem or andro, and also a lot of disassociation (like, **alot** of disassociation). I just feel like my gender is so,, muddy, so unclear and so on and as such im worried that I will regret transitioning. Im a rather impulsive person so maybe im jumping into it too fast? Im not sure. I know this was a little rambly but I just kind of need to vent and hear yalls advice. Did any of you guys medically transition?

(Please don't take these the wrong way, my intentions are genuine)

Doesn't the concept of non-binary kind of reinforce the current gender paradigm, in that if non-binary people become nb because they don't feel they fit into those rigid stereotypical definitions of male/female, aren't they necessarily perpetuating those stereotypes? If I am a male and don't identify as nb, do you believe that I must then be a stereotypical male? 

Does this do a disservice to ""abolishing toxic masculinity"" because it instead suggests that the traits absent from a toxically masculine man (eg emotional expression, compassion etc) aren't something that can be masculine at all? Because if you do exhibit those traits, then you wouldn't be a male by your definition, instead non-binary?

So, to start this off I'd just like to say that I'm afab but recently came out to my close friends that I'm non binary and would love if they called me Finn (my preferred name) and used they/them pronouns when referring to me or just speaking about me both in and out my presence. And luckily for me, my friends as a whole picked this up pretty quickly and have been referring to me as Finn and using my preferred pronouns, but if there wasn't a problem I wouldn't be ranting here to you all!

For a heads up, the majority of my friends (99% of them) are part of the lgbtqia+ community and they *obviously* understand the importance of making everyone comfortable and respecting everyone's pronouns and preferred names.

But, the main reason I'm here...may seem small and silly.

I didn't see the messages until yesterday, but I'm upset.

2021-03-03 11:11:57,lwrf61,6,3,"Ello peeps, 25 she/they, I have been public out to friends and family as she/they for a few months now (born female). In college, I had a small friend group that used those pronouns for me I never told anyone else, my last year of college was stressful due to 3 roommates/ex-friends that started lies and bs, anyways.

I always felt weird about my gender identity but didn't know how my mom would feel. I know my siblings and bf wouldn't care. While my family (besides some of the grand and great grandparents) are for LGBTQ+, I didn't know how much my mom would approve of me. I am pan/demisexual so adding nonbinary would confuse her. It didn't really and I told her that even when I prefer ""they/them"" she can still call me by ""she/her"".

I just wondered if anyone is like me and sort of straddling the old and new identity? It feels uncomfortable sometimes. I can be freely me online but in real life I'm all tense and squashed.

I am writing a paper on gender-neutral names and their relation to trans and gender non-conforming identities. So if you're trans or enby and have changed your name I'd love it if you would answer a couple questions for me :)

1) What did you change your name to?
2) Why did you choose it?
3) Did you consider other names?
4) Was your assigned name/deadname ""clearly indicative"" of a gender and if you're comfortable with it, what was it? You don't have to name your deadname if you don't want to!
5) Did you get your name legally changed (yet)?
6) What country are you from?

2021-03-05 02:03:05,ly1d6r,9,3,"CW: discussion of a past ab\*sive relationship, queerphobia

This is a long post sorry! Hey all, I'm stuck in lockdown again and as always forced to sit with myself... I'm AFAB, demisexual bisexual, and 29yo. I apologise in advance if my language is clunky or if I mispeak, this is all still very new to me...

A friend recently introduced me to Dorian Electra's music (i know I know, late to the party) and watching their videos and hearing them sing reinforced what I've known since I was a child - that I'm not cis. I don't really know where I sit genderwise, but the best I can tell is some flavour of enby &lt;3 I came out as bi several years ago, but have never really been able to process my feelings around gender identity properly. I have started using she/they pronouns, but only a few close friends know about this.

Looking back, I have always felt euphoria when seeing openly out nonbinary and genderqueer people (not that there's a specific ""look"" of course) who mirror how I wish I could present myself gender expression-wise. As a child, I always felt most aligned with genderqueer people, although I didn't know what that concept was at the time - I just knew it felt right and that I wanted to be like them. Now that I'm older, I now know that I have had moments of dysphoria in the past - I've had dysmorphia for years due to other reasons, but I didn't pick up on this until recently. I was always a ""tomboy"", and when I present as traditionally femme I feel like I'm putting on a costume rather than showing my true gender expression. But at the same time sometimes I do feel like a woman, and I don't know whether that makes all this invalid or not!

The most ""me"" I've felt was several years ago when I was unknowingly binding using sports bras (I didn't know what it was at the time lol), and dressing somewhat more masculine and androgynously. Unfortunately, I then found myself in a relationship for a few years with someone who was very queerphobic. It was an emotionally abusive relationship and I suppressed a lot of myself to get by... I thought that my feelings towards myself were just internalised misogyny and fear of being seen by men in a certain light, or rebellion against societal ideas around womanhood and AFAB bodies. But after years of reflecting, I know that it's much more than that.

I'm in my late 20s, which I still think is comparably young, but I just feel so out of place. All my queer friends figured this kind of thing out about themselves in their late teens - meanwhile, growing up in a liberal but relatively conservative household, I didn't even know what Queer is/could look like until my early 20s... There was no one who I related to around this or could talk to, and I didn't know what to look for elsewhere.

Recently, I've tried bringing the topic up in conversation with friends along the lines of ""oh hey, I found \[insert genderqueer artist/performer/writer/etc\]'s work the other day, I'm really enjoying it"", and the general response has been ""lol you're like 4 years behind keep up""... I just feel really discouraged from coming out knowing that I'm behind everyone around me in terms of figuring themselves out, and I'm coming into this as a noob compared to them :( I'm incredibly lucky to be going to art school where I have many queer friends, but as much as I am grateful to be able to talk to them about this (something I'm still only just starting to do) I want to be able to come out properly.

TLDR: after years of gender questioning and suppression, I can finally accept that I'm nonbinary. But I don't know how to come out, and I'm scared of being laughed at for being too late to the party. I'm scared that because I don't have a defined gender identity, that I sometimes align with my assigned gender, and that I don't often feel dysphoria that I'm not valid. 

Any perspectives from other people who've gone through this or could share their insights would be really appreciated &lt;3",NonBinary,Feeling lost and too late to the party :(,1614934985.0,"{'created_utc': 1614909785, 'id': 'ly1d6r', 'num_comments': 9, 'score': 3, 'selftext': 'CW: discussion of a past ab\\*sive relationship, queerphobia\n\nThis is a long post sorry!

TW: will discuss transphobic micro aggressions and menstruation

So I started to befriend someone in my town that I met through my local Buddhist community. We seemed to just click right away! She felt very open, understanding, and nonjudgmental. 

Then I started following the spiritual coaching business she runs with her sister on IG. They preach freedom from “controlling your cycle” (against hormonal BC) and they also keep speaking as if only women menstruate or have uteri, etc. I don’t think they’re intentionally excluding trans people. I more get the feeling that they don’t know many and therefore haven’t had to think about the way they talk about biology? I dunno. 

They’re always having these “women’s circles” where they talk about nurturing your womb space and leaning into your menstrual cycle... 

I’m trying to decide if I should reach out and express to this friend of mine that this is exclusive of people with my experience on many levels. 

I’m a non-binary person that menstruates but also has endometriosis that I gladly treat with hormonal birth control pills. 

I’ve also never seen them acknowledge their privilege as middle-class, white, cisgender women when they talk about things like the law of attraction, manifesting...

So, thanks for reading my rant. What are your thoughts? Any other enbies that menstruate getting sick of all this divine womyn womb talk within spirituality?

2021-03-08 21:03:50,m0q1b4,4,1,"Not sure if I’m looking for advice or just want to vent my fears.

I’ve only recently started doing research into gender theory and realized that I feel like a demiboy. I’m AMAB but never quite liked the box I was put into and I want to soon publicly go by He/They.
I (along with my partner) are in a group chat with recently-reconnected college friends who all identify as queer and one as NB. This is the group I wanted to come out to first because they’re the most likely to “get it”, but at the same time I’m scared of being seen as an imposter. I worry they see me as the “token straight guy” or something and would feel like I’m not really enby or whatever.
I was literally going to come out to my partner TONIGHT (at our anniversary dinner), but in a weird twist of fate she said this in the group text today: “...I see people write their pronouns as “she/they” and Im like no you’re straight and you don’t go by both you just think it’s cool!!”

I jumped in trying to explain why it’s okay to use both pronouns, without revealing how horrible seeing that message made me feel! And everyone else seems more or less ambivalent about it.

Anyway now I’m afraid to come out to my partner because I think she’ll see me the exact same way she mentioned seeing other people. I’m also afraid to come out to this group, or publicly, because I don’t have enough queer bonafides.

I’m AMAB but never quite liked the box I was put into and I want to soon publicly go by He/They.\nI (along with my partner) are in a group chat with recently-reconnected college friends who all identify as queer and one as NB. This is the group I wanted to come out to first because they’re the most likely to “get it”, but at the same time I’m scared of being seen as an imposter. I worry they see me as the “token straight guy” or something and would feel like I’m not really enby or whatever.\nI was literally going to come out to my partner TONIGHT (at our anniversary dinner), but in a weird twist of fate she said this in the group text today: “...I see people write their pronouns as “she/they” and Im like no you’re straight and you don’t go by both you just think it’s cool!!”\n\nI jumped in trying to explain why it’s okay to use both pronouns, without revealing how horrible seeing that message made me feel! And everyone else seems more or less ambivalent about it.\n\nAnyway now I’m afraid to come out to my partner because I think she’ll see me the exact same way she mentioned seeing other people.

The thing is... I don’t know? I used tumblr throughout my preteens and in high school and that’s how I discovered the gender spectrum. I saw something that said “if you’re questioning your gender that means you’re not cis” and I then started using they/them and she/her pronouns interchangeably. My first years of college I cut my hair and dyed it and got nose piercings and really experimented with my body and presentation and I loved the feeling of being androgynous. When I moved back home I grew my hair long again and I guess i present femininely now. I understand that gender is not the same as your presentation and it isn’t the same as your pronouns. I’m just really confused. I acknowledge that I have a “female” body and that I’m representative of women in my field (military musician) but I just don’t... feel like a “woman”... am I Cis and just don’t submit to gender roles?

2021-03-09 23:40:41,m1jpei,7,1," 

**Summary**: Questioned myself for over a decade and finally admitted I want to start HRT for masculinization. Current boyfriend has already stated he isn't comfortable with the relationship if I do so. I need time to figure out my finances but when to tell him is stressing me out so much due to several deadlines. I'm not sure where to start or how to feel. 

**Me**: He/They , transmasculine / nonbinary, Pansexual

**Past**: Several occasions as a teenager I expressed interest in transitioning and being more masculine. I was usually talked out of it, terrified, and pushed it down. 

For the past 10 years, I've identified as nonbinary gender. I've thought about starting T before but always talked myself out or had other life crises going on. 

I've even been looking at top surgery since 19.

**Discovery**: Realizing and admitting to myself last night I want to start T was liberating. Suddenly looking at myself wasn't as difficult because I know it's a work in progress and had a direction for once. Before I was just wallowing in misery feeling trapped and confused. I can literal visual myself now in the kind of roles and places I want to be in the future which is a absolute first. 

**Current Relationship:** My boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years. It is the most stable and healthy relationship I've ever had. 

He's been with me when I first started getting help for my ADHD, my name change (to a nickname he already knew me by), and getting my ID marker changed to X.  I've even spoken to him about wanting top surgery and he's heard me complain about my struggle to afford it. 

His main concern was if I wanted to ""fully"" transition and he wasn't comfortable with that. 

It has come up a few times with discussing other things and he asked if I wanted T in a worried tone. I kept justifying a ""no"" thinking maybe I just want to be more toned or something. 

His last serious relationship ended weeks before their wedding because she had slept with another woman and wanted to come out as lesbian. He said it wasn't as “bad” as his friend though, who was dating someone for 4 years before they came out as wanting to be a man…..

Obviously, it seems that despite loving him if I choose this he will no longer want to be in the relationship. It's complicated, sure, but I'm still heart broken. 

**$ / Living Situation:**  Since COVID, my finances have really taken a hit but I'm doing what I can to improve that as we speak. 

We are both in an expensive lease that would be costly to break. It doesn't end till August.

We have two cats. Both have my name on the adoption paper and we're my idea. He may want the younger one but I am feeling guilty over the idea of him missing the pets but also separating them. 

The place he works at is shutting down (cuz COVID) in July. I don't want him to turn down jobs or keep planning things as a couple since he won't likely want to be with me.  He has a lot of options out of state if he didn’t want to stay with me.

Current boyfriend has already stated he isn\'t comfortable with the relationship if I do so. I need time to figure out my finances but when to tell him is stressing me out so much due to several deadlines. I\'m not sure where to start or how to feel. \n\n**Me**: He/They , transmasculine / nonbinary, Pansexual\n\n**Past**: Several occasions as a teenager I expressed interest in transitioning and being more masculine. I was usually talked out of it, terrified, and pushed it down. \n\nFor the past 10 years, I\'ve identified as nonbinary gender. I\'ve thought about starting T before but always talked myself out or had other life crises going on. \n\nI\'ve even been looking at top surgery since 19.\n\n**Discovery**: Realizing and admitting to myself last night I want to start T was liberating. Suddenly looking at myself wasn\'t as difficult because I know it\'s a work in progress and had a direction for once. Before I was just wallowing in misery feeling trapped and confused. I can literal visual myself now in the kind of roles and places I want to be in the future which is a absolute first. \n\n**Current Relationship:** My boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years. It is the most stable and healthy relationship I\'ve ever had. \n\nHe\'s been with me when I first started getting help for my ADHD, my name change (to a nickname he already knew me by), and getting my ID marker changed to X.  I\'ve even spoken to him about wanting top surgery and he\'s heard me complain about my struggle to afford it. \n\nHis main concern was if I wanted to ""fully"" transition and he wasn\'t comfortable with that. \n\nIt has come up a few times with discussing other things and he asked if I wanted T in a worried tone. I kept justifying a ""no"" thinking maybe I just want to be more toned or something. \n\nHis last serious relationship ended weeks before their wedding because she had slept with another woman and wanted to come out as lesbian. He said it wasn\'t as “bad” as his friend though, who was dating someone for 4 years before they came out as wanting to be a man…..\n\nObviously, it seems that despite loving him if I choose this he will no longer want to be in the relationship. It\'s complicated, sure, but I\'m still heart broken. \n\n**$ / Living Situation:**  Since COVID, my finances have really taken a hit but I\'m doing what I can to improve that as we speak. \n\nWe are both in an expensive lease that would be costly to break. It doesn\'t end till August.\n\nWe have two cats. Both have my name on the adoption paper and we\'re my idea. He may want the younger one but I am feeling guilty over the idea of him missing the pets but also separating them. \n\nThe place he works at is shutting down (cuz COVID) in July. I don\'t want him to turn down jobs or keep planning things as a couple since he won\'t likely want to be with me.  He has a lot of options out of state if he didn’t want to stay with me. \n\nBut...I also need time. I don\'t want to slam this down and then not even have the $ for my own place.

2021-03-11 04:24:20,m2hozd,0,1,"Hello!
For over a year now, I've been in a bit of a gender crisis. Long story short, I've come to the loose conclusion that I would like to identify as non-binary. Also I guess a disclaimer to give more context, yes, I am a minor, but this is something very important to me that I have done my research about. And also laid in bed for hours wondering why I was feeling the way that I was.
So then the big question is, how do I come out? My friends are very open minded and are in/very welcoming to the lgbtq+ community, I'm not too worried about them. The problem is my parents. No, not in regards to my safety or anything like that. I'm lucky to have parents that I can trust to love me even if I'm not always what they expect. But I feel like they aren't going to take me seriously. I don't know how to convey my feelings and explain why this is so important to me while also telling them that it doesn't have to be a big deal. I'm so scared that they'll just brush it off as 'just another weird teenage phase'.
I'm sorry, there are probably posts like this all the time but I'm just really lost.

2021-03-11 14:10:17,m2qvk8,9,1,"Hey everyone, 

I (she/they 22) have been having some issues with some of the feelings I’ve been having this past week. Monday was my birthday, which is also international women’s day. I love celebrating feminism and embrace it as someone who is about to graduate with a Gender and Sexuality Studies minor. I had a “friend” who said to me “I don’t know why you’re so hype about international women’s day when you’re NB, woman does not apply to you anymore... right?” 

At first I was hurt and found it to be messed up, and here is why: 1) I am AFAB which inherently does not make me a woman, but I have been socialized my entire life as a woman and have not realized I was NB or even given myself the label until a couple of months ago 2) gender is fluid and so I believe non-binary women exist because we should not expect ppl to be 100% NB. Forcing people into a category like that is problematic and isolates ppl who have intragroup differences. People who identify as NB can also be NB women/ NB men because they feel partly woman/man. 

Does this make sense? I am really just open minded at this point to hearing either argument, my friend just obviously had this rude tone and way of going about it that really hurt my feelings.

I've heard arguments saying Super Straight people want a term to describe their attraction to only cisgender men/women. I can understand that, but making an entire sexuality and flag surrounding their preference is fundamentally flawed for the following reason:

The difference between the Super Straight community and other sexualities is that the Super Straight label is used to describe their attraction to a specific physical trait that's more specific than just gender. In this case, Super Straights are not attracted to just women or men, but rather a physical aspect that is more specific than just gender. No sexuality in the LGBTQ+ community (as far as I know of, at least) focuses on a specific physical trait within a gender group. There's no sexuality for those attracted to specific skin colors, hair color, height, etc.

The problem with the Super Straight community is their choice to define a sexuality based on attraction to someone's natural genitalia matching their gender presentation invalidates trans people by refusing to see trans women as ""real"" women (and trans men as ""real"" men). No sexuality in the LGBTQ+ community has anything purely focused on physical traits within a gender group, and therefore the Super Straight community has no place in the LGBTQ+ community.

2021-03-11 22:10:20,m3259c,2,1,"   Okay so I just came out to my partner of 7 years about being enby. I tried to explain to him how I felt and what I was going through best I could but I'm so new to all of this despite being 23 yo. He was very stoic and wouldn't really talk much or ask questions. When he finally did it was when I mentioned that I was not happy with my chest size and would like at the very least to get a reduction to feel more comfortable with myself. Also that I might want to be put on t in the future though I'm pretty sure now that's not what I want. He asked what all would happen to me if I did and I explained what little I knew. Immediately he wouldn't look at me and said ""I'm not attracted to that. I wouldn't be attracted to you anymore if you did that."" 

  Idk why but despite not really wanting to go on t, I still felt overwhelmingly hurt/crushed by that...it's been a little while since and I can't seem to let go of it despite Knowing that I enjoy both my feminine and masculine self expression and don't want t.

2021-03-11 23:15:21,m33ijj,0,1,"Hi! 👋 Lurker here and this is where I’m at: 

So I’ve struggled with gender basically all my life. Grew up in a household and state where gender assigned roles and birth order (at home) were very important. I hated being a girl and I binded in HS and college. And the feeling of euphoria not being recognized as a gender was amazing! At it made me so happy when my mom scolded me because some random person thought I was a guy. I mostly thought I was asexual then but realized I’m repressed. 

I get depressed when I grow out my hair. I don’t feel like me and I feel like I’m trying to be someone I’m not. I’ve looked into transitioning on and off for months at a time for years but I realized I don’t really see myself as a guy either and most days I can’t imagine having a package between my legs or stubble on my face. 

I just turned 30 and realized I default to ‘they’ pronouns. Even my SO who is very much a guy, I leave as ambiguous. Many times ‘She’ makes me uncomfortable. It reminds me of all the things I couldn’t do which sometimes makes me feel ashamed like I should be shouting I’m a woman and look what I’ve done! 

Some days I wear a dress and I channel that fuck ya I’m a woman energy. Other days, I fantasize and dream about being a guy with a 5oclock shadow and plowing my bf in the ass. I fantasize about owning a large library with wood furnishings, art on the walls, a gigantic desk with odd assortments of skulls and measuring devices. Sitting down with scotch and a cigar stroking my beard. 

I’ve had long term crushes on both sexes and have kissed girls but I’ve never been in a relationship with them mostly because I think I’m scared. Im not comfortable with my body (though I’m getting there) and it took years of life drawing of nude models to feel ok around naked people. And now I’ve been in a long term 4 year long relationship, it doesn’t seem to matter much. 

But most days, I’m neither. I’m just me. Braless, sometimes hairy, androgynous with no gender. 
My friends used to call me by a masculine nickname but now everyone calls me by my shortened name which can be ambiguous. I want kids and I want to carry them in my body but it also freaks me out and I don’t want my boobs to get any bigger and they’re pretty flat to begin with. 

So I’m trying out ‘they/them’ for myself. I’m not out. I don’t even know if it’ll make a difference. I feel like I’ve danced between faking being a woman and faking being a guy for a long time. I’m not sure what I’m even looking to find or why it keeps coming up. 

But that’s where I’m at and I just wanted to say Hi 👋 and I really love seeing everyone here expressing themselves. Please don’t get mad if I’ve said something offensive. I don’t have a clue what I’m doing. But I think you all are beautiful 🥰

We’re lucky, though. My dad needed time to adjust, but he was perfectly accepting of him being trans. Since my brother was in middle school, my dad wanted some time to make sure this was what he said it was, but my dad was ready to bring my brother to therapy and find a doctor for HRT after the right amount of time. He’s watching his own language and everybody else’s to make sure nobody’s hurting my brother or attacking his gender.    
    
We’re both transmasc. But he’s a trans man; I’m not. I like he/him pronouns, but I prefer them with they/them pronouns. I don’t think my dad will get that as easily. He supports all GSRMs,* but there are some he doesn’t understand, and it frustrates him. The most questionable conversations he’s ever had about this are about how “gender doesn’t exist anymore,” or just today, “gender’s being taken from people who care about it,” etc. He doesn’t understand all the changes in languages, he feels lost about what is and isn’t offensive now, and he doesn’t think he understands how we’re supposed to see gender anymore. We were just talking about it today, and he says he doesn’t blame trans or nonbinary people for it. Still, he always gets a little riled up when this comes up. It’s just enough that it worries me.    
    
I’m not out. I don’t know how to come out. I don’t want my identity to be a hot-topic debate or some confusing mess. I just wish it was as easy for me to come out as it was for my brother. I’m not saying that to be like “bInArY tRaNs PeOpLe HaVe PrIvIlEgE oVeR uS” because they don’t—but in this one household, I’m still really jealous that when my brother says what he is, our dad always understands. I want to be called my name and both of my pronouns; I want to see a therapist and start my own transition; I want to be able to joke with my dad about all the stupid stuff that I’ve noticed or that’s started happening since I began transitioning online, like how kids at my school got more excited to talk to me when I became the only trans/NB person in the room, or the memes and the little social circles I’ve found for people like me, or hell—I want to talk about how confusing this is with him as an NB. To be honest, I completely get his confusion. Before I started exploring my gender, I couldn’t wrap my head around what being nonbinary meant at all. I feel like it makes a little more sense from a first-person POV, but there’s still a lot I want to work through. I just don’t know if any of those conversations would go like I’d want them to.    
    
I know it’s a really common experience, our parents not understanding us. A lot of us have it worse, and get straight-up rejected by our parents. I’m so grateful I have a dad who is accepting, and is trying to understand everything, even if he doesn’t yet.

I want to be called my name and both of my pronouns; I want to see a therapist and start my own transition; I want to be able to joke with my dad about all the stupid stuff that I’ve noticed or that’s started happening since I began transitioning online, like how kids at my school got more excited to talk to me when I became the only trans/NB person in the room, or the memes and the little social circles I’ve found for people like me, or hell—I want to talk about how confusing this is with him as an NB. To be honest, I completely get his confusion. Before I started exploring my gender, I couldn’t wrap my head around what being nonbinary meant at all. I feel like it makes a little more sense from a first-person POV, but there’s still a lot I want to work through. I just don’t know if any of those conversations would go like I’d want them to.    \n    \nI know it’s a really common experience, our parents not understanding us. A lot of us have it worse, and get straight-up rejected by our parents. I’m so grateful I have a dad who is accepting, and is trying to understand everything, even if he doesn’t yet. Part of me just really hurts when I get to watch my younger brother go through his transition journey without any problems at home, but if I said anything about myself, my dad would just be completely lost.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'My brother showed us what a lucky deal we got with our dad, but...', 'created': 1615532922.0}"

So I figured out that I (afab and lesbian) am nonbinary at the end of last year. I still have a lot to figure out about it, and I still have my moments of “you’re not really nonbinary though, womanhood is just alienating for you and your bpd is messing with you”. Especially in terms of gender presentation I still have a lot to figure out for myself. I didn’t think I could feel gender euphoria because mostly I just feel alienated from everything if that makes sense. But I have been thinking about choosing a different name for months now because my given one is very traditionally associated with women/girls. For several reasons the concept of a dead name isn’t working for me personally, and today I realised that the chosen name I’ve been pondering over, which has connections to my given name, doesn’t have to mean that the given name is dead, it’s like a pokemon evolution, with the given name being the name of the basic form? That realisation helped for things to fall into place for me.

I talked to my gf about it and told her which names I thought about and which of them is my favourite and they asked me if I want to try that name from now on. Then they used it for me for the first time and I’m just. Really happy?

First post on here.

[TW: talk of menstruation]

I came out as non binary just over a year ago and began the process of starting HRT and am now awaiting top surgery in July.

Initially I felt a lot of pressure to identity as a trans man when I came out because I knew I didn’t want breasts, I wanted a more masculine/gender ambiguous body and I had a quite bad gender dysphoria. I never felt like a man, just a non woman?

I began puberty blockers to stop my monthly bleeds (big area of dysphoria for me) and they stopped almost immediately, which was AMAZING 🤩 at the same time I was put on a normal dose of testosterone for a trans man which, I was happy about as it was giving me more muscle and helping to ease my dysphoria but in the back of my mind I’ve been worried that I’m going to look too much like a man?

So basically, I’m wondering now that I’ve had a slight voice drop, bottom growth and I’m happy with my body could I stop taking T or at least lower my dose of T and stay on blockers or would that be dangerous for my health?

I have felt very comfortable since I've accepted myself as non-binary.


I have managed to make most of my wardrobe comfortable for how I want to present myself in most occasions, but I have a problem with bras specifically.


I don't know how to explain, but... I feel like my genitals don't bother me (although I wish I could be some sort of shapeshifter), but my breasts do sometimes bother me actively by just being there.


There are some days where I like regular bras and like to have a distinct bust, but I mostly just want to flatten and ""protect"" them. I'm looking for something that is healthy, cause I would like to breastfeed some day as a parent (even though pregnancy and my body changing for breastfeeding and such feels kinda wrong for my body, but that's another topic). I also like to hide the presence of nipples, so something with a thick front fabric or something like that.


What can I buy to feel comfortable physically and that it's also wearable under any type of shirt?
Are there things I need to be aware of, can I cause myself physical damage by buying the wrong thing?

Typically I think myself as trans masc non-binary (Demi-boy) but I’ve recently come to the realization that I’m much more fluid than I originally thought. 

Most of the time I’m fine or indifferent with my body and I’ll experience dysphoria and be uncomfortable on and off however it’s very mild most of the time. I’ve kind of realized that every day it’s different for me and sometimes the dysphoria is worse at different moments. I still think I’m Demiboy but I’ve just come to the realization that I’m a lot more fluid. I honestly just wish I could choose everyday how I looked and it just be an option. Sometimes I feel I’d be comfortable in both “stereotypical bodies,” neither, or one over the other. Most of the time I see myself as trans masculine and feminine in presentation but occasionally it will be a lot more fluid than that (gender wise).

Cheers to self acceptance I guess lmao. Not joking, I have gone through another life crises from this. 

Simple summary of my life crises (I feel like there are way too many tbh and I’m not entirely sure if this is the right word for this) Also including a TW here for suicidal thoughts and unwanted thoughts.

1. 5th-6th grade i started feeling immensely uncomfortable with puberty and dealt with suicidal ideation and really really really bad unwanted thoughts. All I can remember is that I physically couldn’t look in the mirror and be happy with how I looked and would dissociate every day for a period of time on and off. Very bad anxiety would literally have an anxiety attack every night when anything went slightly wrong. 7th grade: puberty was fine to handle then got worse. On and off suicidal thoughts and heavy unwanted thoughts. 

2. 8th grade-9th grade: realized I liked girls and guys. Heavy suicidal ideation and heavy unwanted thoughts. Dissociating every day. Very close to death (I do not recommend it lmao. Also I know it’s not funny and it’s serious ok. I’m just laughing at my own awful experiences). When I didn’t feel numb and dissociating I dealt with very very very bad anxiety. I also hated myself soooo much so there’s that. 

3. 9th grade: I realized I was trans. Dissociation every day and felt extremely empty and numb, felt extremely uncomfortable with by body, on and off suicidal ideation and heavy unwanted thoughts. Anxiety rampant. 

4.  10th grade (now): Unwanted thoughts (on and off but intense), occasional suicidal ideation. Gender crises again. Bad anxiety most days but it’s getting slightly better maybe? Tbh idk. No dissociation so that’s great!! :)

Tbh I think I’m doing a lot better now compared to my last “identity crises” I’ve gone through. 

Honestly I probably should get help for these issues but I’m 16, probably couldn’t afford it, don’t know the process, and don’t have enough courage to tell my mom the shit that my mind goes through. :)

I guess I could say this is self acceptance and me getting slightly better?? 

Also, I know what all these things are and feel like and I know I probably should get help for these things. I also know that self diagnosis is bad but trust me I know what dissociation feels like, anxiety feels like, and what depression feels like because I’ve felt it. I’m not diagnosed and eventually want to but rn I don’t have the time and can’t deal with telling my mom I need help. Especially since it’s getting slightly better rn (which means it will probably crash again so I’m just waiting for that to happen which is always wonderful *sarcasm). So if you had any comments that you were going to say about that, don’t. I already know. Thank you. You don’t have to tell me.

I met the trans and nb community when I was 13, and have felt uncomfortable with my gender assigned at birth since even before. 
I never said anything to anyone because my friends were always making fun of lgbt people, and i thought they would hate me.
I have been trying to make myself feel comfortable with my gender assigned at birth, and for one year or so left my hair grow and dressed up in ""girly"" clothes as I was obsessed with magical girls. My best friend told me ""I knew it was a phase"".
 I met my bf that year, and we broke up for another year where I went trough really harsh things and I cut my hair and got back into dressing more androginously. Then we got back together, last year, and I told him how i felt about my gender, he just looked at me so i assumed it was ok. Lately he has been expressing how he dislikes nb people. I got very sad and i think he noticed it but i don't know. I'm very nervous to tell him. I don't care about the pronouns others use on me so it's ok if he wants to keep using the ones he used all this time so idk, but i don't want him to hate me.
Also my dad, whom i told this a few years back, has been saying very transphobic things lately bc he got into a shitty politic who says things like that. And he says this things in my face.
Also I'm not really sure. i'm pretty sure i am non binary, but by changing names every few months I feel like...not valid enough? I tought about asking two friends to call me Ren to see if it feels right, but i didn't had the courage to do so since they're  the ones that maked fun of nb people when we were younger...(they have changed since then i think)
I do have friends who know. They're the ones I knew would accept me since they also struggle with their gender.

2021-03-13 03:56:29,m3yjxf,1,1,"I'm really confused lol

Lately I've been seriously questioning my gender. I don't really know if i have a reason why - I was busy trying to figure out my sexuality (still not sure) and it kind of morphed into gender. I don't think I feel uncomfortable when people use she/her pronouns (I'm afab), but when people call me a 'lady' or 'woman' it doesn't feel exactly right.  I'm not sure if its just because I have negative associations with those words or if I actually am not a girl. I've never felt a huge connection to being a 'girl' but at the same time idk what thats supposed to feel like. I was really uncomfortable in a dress the last time I wore it (excluding my school uniform) and when I caught myself in the mirror it didn't exactly feel like I was looking at myself.

I also have really low self-esteem and have always wanted a flatter chest, but I genuinely cant tell if its dysphoria or a bad self image. I don't know if its that I don't want to be a girl or I just don't want to be me. I've always wanted a flatter chest but I think I'm pretty comfortable with my genitals. I saw a post where it said something like 'I just want to be a skinny white guy with dark hair who can do feminine things like wear makeup but still look masculine' and I related to that but now idk if I want to be like that or if I'm attracted to that type of person? It really doesn't help that I don't even know who I'm attracted to lol. I sometimes see people like that and I have no clue if its 'gender envy' or I just find them attractive.

When I was younger I vaguely remember 'wanting' to be a guy. I guess that feeling faded for a bit but lately I've caught myself wondering if I'd like myself better if I was amab. A few times I've been playing video games and people have assumed I was a guy, but I wasn't overly bothered by it - idk if I just didn't want to come across as a 'pick me'. 

Basically I have no idea whats going on. I'm worried that I'm faking or exaggerating to be 'different'. This was mostly a vent but if anyone has had a similar experience it would be really great if they could maybe help me out a bit. Sorry if this is really confusing, I just needed to get this out somewhere. Also if this is offensive in any way I won't hesitate to take it down.

2021-03-13 14:16:48,m474mg,14,1,"So, I (18) am a non-binary person. I know that I own a penis. I like to call myself ""penis-owner"" so when people tell me to be a man I just say I am not a man but a penis-owner and don't want their gender roles on me. So yes, I am not angry for people misgendering me, but I rather want them to slowly learn how I hate the gender roles they put on people.

The worst example is my girlfriend. Once I was talking to her about the feeling I have that I don't feel like associating myself with men, and I absolutely relate to people like Sam Smith. Sam Smith is my absolute non-binary role model. So the conversation goes on and on. And to something I said about feeling more feminine than many other males so I dont like being called a man or a boy, my gf answered ""You are not as feminine as you think you are."" And: ""I know many more feminine boys than you."" 

It felt like she was not thinking that me wanting to get away from all this manliness-nonsense is valid. She is LGBTQ+ supporter and somewhat a bisexual herself so I do not know if I present myself wrong, or if she does not understand.

Getting people to understand that I am non-binary and dont want gender related stuff attached to me is becoming a pain and I dont feel valid and I feel that I am wrong. When I can not for example find something and my gf finds it in 5 seconds and she says ""Men are blind"" I always tell her I am not a man but a penis-owner and she tends to say ""Oh you are a little eh?"" I mean yes I kinda feel like both and neither. Man and woman. I have all those sides in me. But because I hate gender roles I want to be outside of all that sh*t.

And my gf is not the only one who has somehow told me my feelings about this are not valid, or always keep associating stuff with genders which drives me crazy. The worst one is not my gf, and she has begun to get all of this. But on the other hand, sometimes when a more conservative person tells me my gender is what I have in my pants not what I think and I got to be something, I lose all my will and just start to call myself a boy.

 I'm 27 AMAB and recently came to the realization that I am non-binary. I've become quite comfortable with my sexuality (gay), but I honestly just never thought about my gender or gender identity. I've been an ally and advocate for the trans community and through that I was asked to present and discuss gender in a corporate environment because their original speaker backed out and they needed someone last minute (I've led discussions about the LGB but as we know the TQ+ have historically been left behind)

They said if I was comfortable, to make it personal, so I wrote my speech. When I get to anatomical sex and gender identity I keep getting stuck on the sentence, ""I am a man."" It just doesn't seem, right? And while I like and will probably continue to use he/him pronouns, I started to think about getting called they/them and it felt good also (I tried she/her too, not so much)

I've never been that concerned about my gender or thought about it but I express myself in a pretty masculine way, from voice, dress, activities etc. I lean masculine but I'm not opposed to expressing femininity or doing ""feminine"" activities.

The presentation is making me think about my identity more. The more I'm leaning into this and even as I am writing this I'm accepting that I am non-binary but express masculine. I'm afraid though that if I come out, I'm not going to be accepted by anyone because of how I like to express myself. I'm worried my masculinity is going to hinder what people see as my identity and I'm scared I'm not going to be accepted in the nb community too.

I’m AFAB and I cut my hair short in November. Y’all, the euphoria is real; I barely even recognize myself in photos where I have long hair.

But... Ever since I cut my hair, I’ve found that the dresses and floofy skirts I previously really enjoyed wearing give me dysphoria. This feeling of “this isn’t right, this isn’t me.” The same goes for makeup and painting my nails - I tried some winged eyeliner today and ended up scrubbing it off because it made my skin crawl to look in the mirror. I painted my nails black last night hoping to feel a bit goth, and my small hands looks far to feminine.

When I first came out as non-binary, I used my legal/birth/dead name for several months. Then I picked Em (my first initial was M anyway, so it wasn't much of a leap for most people).

There's one silver lining. The new name that I've been drawn to lately could still use Em as a nickname.

2021-03-16 06:40:51,m62vnb,3,1,"TW dysphoria.

It makes me dysphoric and annoyed that many masc bodied people can put on a dress and immediately be seen as andro but it feels like no matter what I do I'll always be seen as female even if I wear fully men's clothes. I know this is kinda just a part of life rn but was wondering if anyone has any tips. Most of my head is shaved except for some full length hair on top so I can still wear it down sometimes. I'm short and thin, I hope that some weight and muscle will help but can't get on T for mental health reasons. Are there any andro looks people with similar bodies have found help with dysphoria? 

How I'm perceived is starting to effect my mental health because I'm actually dangerously unstable (no I don't want to be; yes I'm working on it and isolating until it's better). I'm like, legit scared for people to continue assuming I'm a harmless woman. My closest ""true form"" is a 12 ft telepathic centipede that does nothing but protect the vulnerable, eat harmful people and constructs for breakfast, and shapeshift into a cat for stealth purposes... So as you can imagine, I have great difficulty with being perceived and interacted with as a 5'3"" fleshlight, and my history with that has already almost ended me up dead, in jail, or hospitalized multiple times.

2021-03-16 07:19:14,m63eag,2,1,"Hi!

Baby enby here! :)

Gender has been this awful, scary, humongous void for as long as I can remember. I spent a fair amount of time over on r/egg_irl before finally accepting that *maybe* the binary wasn't for me.

After many months and lots of internal strife, I finally came out as nonbinary this weekend! (not to my family tho lol not tryna poke that nest)

Buuuut immediately after I started getting hit with this fear that I'd done something I couldn't take back (even though I know that's not true), and started questioning myself INTENSELY. I basically ended up falling right back into the beginning of my self-acceptance journey t.t 

""What if I'm not *really* nonbinary?""  
""What if I just subconsciously want to be special, and I'm hurting actual nonbinary people by doing this?""  
""What if I'm not.... nonbinary enough?"" 

&amp;#x200B;

I've always kind of struggled because I swing pretty far across the gender identity spectrum. At times, I'm extremely comfortable being afab, and at other times the dysphoria is almost unbearable and I have to hide every feminine part of my body just to get through the day. Expressions -- including ones that have nothing to do with the imposed binary-- of gender can either give me intense euphoria or repulse me at different times. 

There's basically nothing binary about my expression, at all.

BUT whenever I'm feeling like my assigned gender, I get the intense sense that I'm faking and the rest goes out of the window. Part of it is almost definitely my BPD (object impermanence dictates that whatever I feel right now, is the only thing I've ever felt &lt;3), but gosh it SUCKS.

2021-03-16 07:21:45,m63fjd,5,1,"Figuring out I was queer felt so much easier (and less permanent) than exploring my gender identity... I'm a bit of a late bloomer on the NB train. I'm AFAB and feel like I've been overperforming femininity my whole life to hide my queerness and hide everything I am, and have only recently been realizing that might encompass my gender. I don't really have the obvious signs that seem to be in damn near every article about being trans since I feel like I've been overperforming femininity my whole life to live up to expectations as someone AFAB while also hating femininity due to the expectations. I just wish I could click a button and know if I was NB, FTM, or what.

Also, when I say femininity I def think gender is a social construct on many levels and stuff like makeup, shaving, etc. don't have a gender. However, I also struggle with the idea that gender is a social construct and that our bodies and behaviors are pointlessly gendered while also understanding WHY I feel so strongly about not being female.

I'm kind of struggling with this concept too, because I feel very strongly ""not female"" and am not ready to accept possibly being male, but at the same time, why does me binding or considering HRT have to mean anything about my gender if these things aren't inherent to gender?

Sorry, this is kind of all over the place, but I'd appreciate thoughts from others who are/have struggled with this.

2021-03-16 14:14:59,m6a0li,1,1," I realized something that was always on my mind: I've always wanted to have a penis. I mean, I like my vagina and I really enjoy it. But ever since I was 15 I've fantasized about having a penis. I've even had dreams where I'm a ""man"" with a penis and I'm getting oral sex from a girl with a cock. 

I'm a 25 F  and I like to flow between the genders but people usually perceive me as a girl old the time (even when I'm in a masculine phase)

Many times, when I have been with men (as I have had male boyfriends before I assumed I was a lesbian), I have had to close my eyes to imagine that they were a girl and that I had a penis (that was the only way I could have an orgasm). 

I feel strange. I like many aspects of being female. I don't want to see myself as a man. I love that my breasts are so small and that I look like I ""don't have"" breasts, while my face and hair are feminine (which I love). I often try to wear very tight bras to hide my breasts even more. And I would love to have a penis. I don't know, I just realized that I always fantasized about it but was always afraid of it. I want to be a woman with a penis, it's the kind of girl I'm attracted to and the kind of girl I want to be. But I'm scared. 

I remember that to some cis boyfriends and a cis girlfriend, I've made the ""hypothetical""  question of what would happen if I were exactly the way I am but with a penis. And I remember the response from the guys was negative and for me it was very disappointing. Deep down I have this fear of ""Ok, but if I were a girl with a penis, who would want me?"" and on the other hand ""it's impossible to have a really functional penis"", it frustrates me so much that I will never be able to have a penis. But I feel like I just hide this.

When I used a strapon for the first time with my girlfriend (she is MTF) it was magical. I wore it the whole time because I wanted to imagine I had a penis. And just watching her sucking it or penetrating it was pleasurable. That day I understood why my sex life was so unsatisfying in the past, I had never been able to be myself during sex. And suddenly I was with a girl just like in my dreams, and I was wearing a strapon. That was my real me.

I feel really weird. I don't know, I would love to choose and be able to have a vagina and a penis, so I don't have to lose anything in the process. Maybe this is absurd. Maybe I'm a stupid cis girl but sometimes I just feel stupid. I feel like I don't know where I belong. I don't want to be a man and I don't want to be a woman. I just want to continue to have a female face, flat chests and have a penis (although a strapon I can settle for).",NonBinary,I need catharsis and someone's opinion,1615929299.0,"{'created_utc': 1615904099, 'id': 'm6a0li', 'num_comments': 1, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ' I realized something that was always on my mind: I\'ve always wanted to have a penis.

2021-03-16 14:59:31,m6az3l,1,1,"Okay, so this is kinda what has been in mind for a long time.

Firstly, I am afab and do not like my body at all. When I was younger the idea of having boobs seemed gr8 and all since the person I was into at that time wouldn't shut up about it, and puberty hit (late), and Istg, I have never felt more uncomfortable in my life. I used to even pass as a guy most of the time and it made me happy when I saw people be like, ""Is that a guy or a girl?"" but now for the past year or so my parents have been making me wear more ""girly"" clothes and my pronouns are he/they, so when I hear everyone uses she/her, it makes me more aware of the fact that at least until I am in a different country, I will not be able to medically or socially transition and all those scenarios I made in my head are just that, made up and most probably not going to come true.

I know who I am, but that doesn't mean I have the courage to tell anyone. My sis already outed me as pan to my mom, and she gave me a long lecture on how this is the result of the internet. I mean, to her the internet is the root cause of everything. So since then, my parents are wary of me and I am wary of my sister, who got to know I am pan by snooping on my laptop. I hate it here and I really can't wait to go somewhere. 

Don't get me wrong, I love my family, but I know if I stay here I am going to be forced into being who they (or at least my mom) want me to be. It is bearable for the most part but sometimes it is so suffocating. They tell me they love me and will support me, only if I am who they want me to be. I hate it when they say, ""This is not you!"" Like how will they know? I have been forced by fear into doing what I have been told and emotionally suppressing myself just because they keep saying they like the me who is always happy and not giving them problems.  FOR YEARS.

The worst part is, I can't get myself to hate them because in my head I am the one who is different and confusing them. I know they will most likely disown me, seeing how weak my mental and emotional state is now, I might act cis and straight just to please them.

Someone, please tell me I am not crazy for still wanting my family, who has made me the most miserable, to still love and support me as a Nonbinary Pansexual.

And honestly it kind of confuses me, because I just can’t imagine factoring things like that into my identity *at all*. I don’t want any label for my gender presentation (be it masc, femme, gender-conforming, GNC, etc.), or any label for my gender identity based in any way on society’s norms or stereotypes regarding gender. I’d rather label myself based on my genitals, thanks (although I’d still rather not do that either).

I currently think I’m probably agender (although I’ve sort of flip flopped between identifying as agender, cis and anywhere in between for a while now). However, there’s a part of me that’s been resisting identifying that way for a bit, and I’m trying to figure out if this is a gender thing or not. Specifically, I’ve found that I’m most likely to call myself a guy (I’m AMAB) and be most uncomfortable being perceived as a woman when I’m doing something traditionally seen as feminine.

For instance, if someone questions why I’m wearing a dress, I’d rather justify myself with “men can wear dresses too”, even though it implies that I’m a man (and I might phrase it more explicitly, say as “I’m a guy and I wear dresses, so what?”), than with ""I'm nonbinary"", because I feel the latter suggests there’s some connection between wearing a dress and being nonbinary; perhaps I identify that way because I don’t fit society’s stereotypes for what a man is, or perhaps I’m dressing that way because I want to be perceived as nonbinary. But neither of those are true; the way I dress isn’t a part of my identity, and I dress for myself, not for others to see me in a particular way.

Basically, it feels deeply wrong to change how I identify because I don’t fit society’s stereotypes, and my brain has been resisting identifying as nonbinary for that reason, because it seems convinced that that’s why I’m doing it. Even though the only reason I identified as a man in the first place was because society told me I was one.

So, I’m wondering if any of this is an indication that I’m cis or have at least a partial connection to manhood, or if I’m agender. (My reason for potentially identifying as agender is simply that I’ve failed to identify any part of me that I’m prepared to call a gender; either I don’t have one, or I do, and maybe it's even staring me in the face, but the label’s worn off so I can’t tell what it is.)",NonBinary,How I feel about gender norms (is this a gender thing or no?),1615977223.0,"{'created_utc': 1615952023, 'id': 'm6r75i', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'I’ve noticed a lot of people when posting “questioning their gender” posts start by explaining what traditionally masculine or feminine things they like, dislike, do or feel uncomfortable doing.

I don't know if I ask y'all this but on this last week i was questioning my identity a lot, ever since I heard of the ""gender casual"" label.

I'm AMAB, but i didn't really care much about my gender until now, i never thought of myself as masculine or feminine, but as some sort of androgynous blob, so I would define myself as a "" different brand of man"".

But even then i didn't even care about thinking of myself as a man and all, it's kinda complicated, but i only thought of myself as ""me"", so when other guys where saying what makes them a man, and i tried to do the same to define myself, i just noticed that the characteristics i mentioned on myself don't have a gender, at least on my opinion.

So I wanted to ask your opinion on this, i did find some labels that would kinda of fit, but i want to give this more thought, just so I can understand it better.

2021-03-17 08:22:00,m6vlsx,1,1,"I’ve been struggling a lot with my identity lately. My mental health is already in the toilet and this isn’t helping.

Just two weeks ago I was so sure I was non binary. I was so happy I found a way to describe myself. I think I accepted it too soon and now I feel like I’ve betrayed myself and the people I’ve told. 

I’ve never felt like I fit it with girls. I didn’t like dressing like one, doing makeup or nails, anything like that. Didn’t like doing my hair, except on rare occasions. I remember feeling pretty though, the few times I did dress up. 

I thought I might be a Demi girl at first. Then I feel maybe like I started to get so desperate to be non-binary that I started to reject femininity. I got a haircut, got more masculine clothes. But now I’m starting to feel more comfortable being feminine again, a little, maybe and I’m so confused. Is this because that’s what it feels like to be a girl, or because that’s just like what *I* feel like? What does it even mean to be a girl? What the fuck am I?

My mom tricked me into coming out to her and it made me feel even worse. I don’t know what to do.

Am I just a girl that wants to be a ‘special snowflake?’ One of those assholes that insults the whole LGBTQ population? Am I a girl that just doesn’t like dressing up super feminine? 

Sometimes I feel like I could be non-binary and others I feel like I’m faking it all, and I’m getting so turned around in my own head it’s making me afraid of my own gender. I get so confused I can’t actually remember if I ever felt neutral in the first place, or feminine, or what. What does it mean if I’m okay with people I’m a girl, even if I dress like a boy. Do I even want to dress like a boy, or at least more neutral? Does that mean I’m just gender non-conforming? What does it mean if someday I want to wear more feminine clothes again? Would that mean it was all ‘just a phase’? Sometimes I wanna look neutral and I remember that I feel more neutral and other times I think I would be okay with being a girl. Or not? I can never actually tell. Is that what it feels like to be genderflux? Do I feel more neutral sometimes because I have depression? To my knowledge nobody feels particularly feminine or masculine when they’re depressed. Did I just overthink my depression and confuse it with my gender?

The first thing my mom asked me when I ‘came out’ to her is if I was just confused and I used to be mad at her for that but she’s right. I am confused. I get more and more confused every time I think about it, but I can never tell her that. She’s one of those people that accuses people of lying or deceit if they change their minds or aren’t sure, especially if they sounded so sure like I did. If I tell her I’m not sure, it’ll just be more shade for her to throw at me later. I don’t want to tell her anyway, because it might turn out I actually AM non-binary. *I just don’t know.* I don’t know and it’s making me really upset.

If you’re still here after all that, I’m sorry. I’m a very disorganized, confused and I know none of it makes sense.

occasionally I feel like, maybe I'm not trans since i'm not feeling it is right but then i look at old pictures of myself and I'm like, OK, I definitely like the changes. 

So i've been thinking about what is wrong, and maybe its the fact that I don't quite feel fully like a woman either? Like I'd be an imposter trying to be a woman, since my brain isn't quite the same and it's starting to feel the same as trying to be male

Further, I do like my boobs, but I don't necessarily want to make them even bigger or show them off in a big way. When i'm wearing a pushup bra it feels a bit strange. 

As for bottom dysphoria, I didn't think I had much, but the more I transition, the more I realize I just want it all gone and it looks wrong.

Facial hair is the same, I love what hormones do for it and i wish laser + hormones worked faster, since it really helps my dysphoria a lot of having it gone. 

Body hair is the same, I really don't like it and shave pretty frequently(way less on hormones now thankfully)

As for hair, I've been wanting to dye it Lilac purple for a while now and grow it longer. But i'm not quite sure on the longer part. 

As for she/her pronouns, they've felt nice, but my chosen name has sometimes felt too gendered?

I also told my partner of 19+ years. That discussion went better than I thought it would, yet didn't end in an optimal result. Understandably, it will take time to adjust to my admission.

I have been going by 'he' all my life, but one thing is sure: I'm no man. All the rest is unsure (and may be so for a long time still)...
Am I NB? Probably. Am I a transwoman? Likely not. Am I demigirl? Maybe. Anyway I present feminine and have chosen a feminine name.

Now, I would like people to use genderneutral words when referring to me (including pronouns), but I get that that is awkward in everyday speech and with the current limitations of gender neutral vocabulary. I'm also dutch-speaking and the die/diens or hen/hun genderneutral pronouns are not as current as they/them (I find them a little awkward myself). So since I present femme, I'd allow feminine words and pronouns too. I don't mind to be referred to as a woman, I even like it, but I'd prefer gender neutral as much as possible.

Yet I am afraid ppl will consistently go to the she/her pronouns and avoid the gender neutral words altogether, when given the option. Because people's brains like to see things binary and can't cope with neutral words. 
That would be a disappointment... And I would honestly think, what's the point of having they/she and not just she/her if ppl are not going to choose to use the they. They/them, I would also not prefer, since I like to be referred to as a woman from time to time and I present femme.

2021-03-28 10:52:47,mez7yh,0,1,"TL;DR; 
Please may i have suggestions for coming out to a large conservative workplace?

Hello friends!

So i’ve known i was non binary for over a year and been out with my partner, close friends and family for almost 6 months, but have yet to come out to my workplace in its entirety. My partner and friends nailed their acceptance of me pretty much immediately and i love them for that. My family and the few coworkers i am out too, however,  are struggling to prove that they accept me as they say they do. They have done little to no work understanding genders outside the binary and barely scrape together correct pronoun usage unless i call them out on it... Which isn’t often enough because i never have the spoons for it. Ive sent resources, answered questions, plastered my pronouns on literally everything i can.

For context, i live in rural Australia in a very conservative boomer town with christian origins, so “this whole queer thing” is just so hard for them to understand, you know?

Anyway, in an attempt to lower my stress levels while just existing at work i wanted to officially come out to my colleagues.

I work in a public hospital in the admin department and we have somewhere between 50-60 staff that come under our admin umbrella. The work culture is very basic, white, cis heteronormative. I am certainly not subtle with my existence as the office queer. I wear a pride badge, pronoun badge, non binary badge. My coffee cup is a heckin pride flag. My pronouns are in my email signature. I’ve done my best to spell it out for them. 

My current plan is talk to my immediate boss, talk to our dept manager, talk to HR, draft an email, send said email, hide under my desk for a week. 

Either that or just stroll into the morning meeting in my most flamboyant outfit and announce it loudly to everyone and dare them to question me as i chug my fourth coffee in two hours.

Those of you that have done this? How did it go? How did you do it? Would you have done things differently? 

Can you psyche me up for it? Because i’ll just keep putting it off otherwise.
