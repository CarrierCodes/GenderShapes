I am a person who was born male, like my male appearance and male features such as body structure(well kinda chubby), facial hair etc but always felt that my genitals didnt really fit me, i just considered myself somekind of exclusive bottom but it still didnt feel quite right.
Since i took this thing more seriously and decided to be more open about wanting to be a man with a vagina everything felt right and started considering surgery more seriously, already got a referral letter from a more known online therapist since I am from Greece which doesnt have many gender therapist, let alone ones that would consider suggesting someone for srs if they are not binary transgender.

2018-01-03 22:43:29,7nyed4,3,20,"One year ago today I finally figured out I'm transgender: nonbinary: bi-gender AFAB. The most amazing thing is that once I figured out I'm not cis, it took me all of an hour to figure out *exactly* where I fit in the transgender spectrum. I am both female and male. Even though I was 47, there was no adjustment for me, no upset or doubt. It was immediately liberating, a relief to finally have an answer to why I'd felt so out of place from childhood. My identity settled into my bones easily. Perhaps because I never knew it was there to hide it. I've just gone with it, never knowing what it was. When I started coming out to family and friends, a common response was ""yeah, that makes sense"" or ""I didn't have a name for it, but I knew it."" Sometimes I think I was the last to know.

Over the last year that led me to explore exactly what I wanted to do with this knowledge. Did I want to make any kind of transition? Presentation (clothes, hair, etc)? Hormonal? Medical/surgical? I experimented a bit. I tried testosterone, and it was right, until it wasn't. I bought some men's clothes. Got my hair cut short.

For a while I was kinda stuck in the middle, situationally one or the other for short periods of time, but usually both, not really a mix in the middle like an androgyne person, but able to see/feel/be both sides more or less equally. Then I went on the strongest masc swing of my life. I felt like I was a transguy, completely. I couldn't see the girl in me at all, except for my continued love of all things girly and sparkly. I loved my testosterone, and began to consider a full physical transition. It lasted several months. Then I went on the first *totally girl* swing of my life. It was my dearest wish from the time I hit puberty to really FEEL like a girl. I would much rather be cis female than any other option. And I loved it. I quit testosterone and went *full girly* and it felt as amazing as I imagined it would. I'm still on that swing. At the moment I feel like I'm cis female, but I know my guy side will eventually come back.

I've also figured out that while my guy side is a guy, and wants to be a guy, for the most part, I don't want to look like a guy, I want to be a guy. I like my outer girly appearance (perhaps my guy side is okay with it because I'm not particularly naturally feminine in build) and love girly clothes and sparkly things. But I also get an odd dual pleasure out of wearing all guy clothes - and making them look totally femme.

2018-01-06 17:36:48,7okl5e,6,22,"Hi. 

I've questioned my gender identity since I was 4/5. When I was 14/15 I discovered the concept of being transgender and came out as genderfluid. I thought about this for a while and realised I might actually be a 100% binary trans man. It was too overwhelming to deal with so I went back into the closet.

A few months ago I came out again, but as a trans man. I asked people to use he/him pronouns and use a new name for me, for christmas I got male gendered presents and I started living as male for a month or so. It was great. Then something happened (I met my boyfriends family) and I realised that I won't be able to transition for the foreseeable future so I became ""okay"" with that. I'm not sure if I'm in denial or not. Now when I think about presenting as male, I feel weird, almost dysphoric. 

I started dressing overly girly and wearing makeup and wigs like I've done several times in the past. I have a history of trauma and mainly like appearing as a girl to get attention from men. (I know, it's awful.) I like the way I look in female clothes because I get complimented and think of myself as attractive. I feel more confident and sexy as a girl but it feels like an overly-dramatised version of myself, like it's just acting and eventually i'll stop pretending and be ""me"" again. I do enjoy acting like a girl though. I have dysphoria but it comes and goes, sometimes it's severe and sometimes it's not there at all. 

When I present as male, I feel more ""me"" but I don't feel attractive at all. I don't know if me switching between these girl and guy phases means I'm genderfluid or whether I'm just in serious denial about my gender and seeking validation by dressing as a woman. If a cis guy cross-dresses for sexual reasons, they're not trans, so wouldn't it be the same for a trans guy? (Only it would mean they were infact male)

Any input? Thanks.

A little bit of background: I’m a 27yo AMAB and I’ve low-key been questioning my gender and sexuality since roughly the end of puberty - so for about 10 years. As a child/teen I’ve been totally fine with being a boy and the prospect of only dating girls. At 17 I came out to myself as bi, triggered by the fact that i had developed a crush on a male friend of mine. In the years ~5 years after that I continued to question my sexuality as I went through the “bi-cycle” and got some practical experience. Result: I’m predominantly attracted to women but also to men, to a lesser degree though. 

On to the gender part: I wasn’t fully comfortable with the male role for that same period of time but until recently didn’t put a label onto it. I’ve mainly played women in video games for about 10 years, I’ve been given a female nickname by at one point of which I approved, so it stuck, and I first acknowledged feminine aspects of my identity in a non-playful/joking when I stumbled upon the “Genderbread Person”. But to me all of that wasn’t a denial of masculinity so much as something extra. I thought of my masculinity as just being somewhat more sensitive and non-macho. That changed last year when one of my favorite YouTubers ContraPoints (if you don’t know her, srsly check her out, she’s amazing) came out as genderqueer. I guess seeing you respect adopt a non-binary identity makes it less scary to see yourself that way. I thought of **agender** as a term that could fit me but so far hadn’t committed to it. 

Enter the worst sex of my life. Yesterday I had a one-night stand with a women and it was terrible. What really got to me is that other than all my previous partners she didn’t treat me like a person, she treated me like a **man**. Everything she did was done with the assumption that I am a man: Foreplay? Not needed. Erogenous zone? Just the dick. Body that is meant to be desired? Just hers, never mine. Dirty talk? Meant to boost my masculinity (god, that was irritating). Throughout the whole process I had to steer her away from that.

I had never realized this before but everything that I had ever enjoyed about sex was not explicitly gendered. The sex I had with women could have been either straight or lesbian (if we consider the social roles involved). The sex with men could have been gay or straight. For years while trying to figure out my sexuality I’ve only considered the other persons gender and never my own. “What portion of me is gay, what portion is straight?” Surprise motherfucker, some part is actually lesbian!

Since I live in a large city in a western country surrounded by progressive minded people the issue of gender doesn’t come up in the rest of my life that often but I think the pattern just described applies. I’m fine with the way I’m treated as long I’m not expected to be a man. 

And now I’m sitting here with the unavoidable conclusion that I’m not in fact a man. I don’t know what I am. Agender, genderfluid, maybe even trans women (I really hope not, that would have some uncomfortable consequences in terms of transitioning)? Outside the occasional societal pressure I don’t feel that uncomfortable with myself. I accept my body, i just don’t like how hairy it is. I don’t have a desire to be seen as a woman, even though I feel good if things about me are feminine. I’ve realized a while ago that the sentence “I am a man” feels like a lie.

I am AFAB, but since I was introduced to the concept of gender beyond cis female and cis male (about 17/18) I have questioned my cis gender 'status', as it were, on and off.

I have gone through a few ""AHA!"" moments, thinking I'd resolved my confusion, only to have myself revisit the same shit over and over and over.   

I have come to the conclusion that I'm cis female, but I am gender non-conforming twice now, only to self doubt all over again when something triggers the topic within me. 

A big thing that I am grappling with is that I have Borderline Personality Disorder and Asperger's, which makes me worried that I'm forcefully trying to take on a new persona to avoid who I am currently; that I'm grasping to TRY TO be Enby/Demi, instead of ACTUALLY being Enby/Demi .  

The last month or so I've had the repeated thought of ""I don't WANT to be a cis woman!"" and I am trying to figure out if that's because I'm legitimately NOT or because again, I am desperately trying to be something else and just don't want to be ME; if that makes sense?

I feel like, if someone said to me ""Okay tomorrow you will be a ""passable"" man""  I wouldn't be upset about losing my identity as a woman.  I identify with being a woman, I am a woman, but I always feel like there's more to me than JUST being a woman? 

I am heavily into the hardcore/punk/metal scene and I always feel really jealous of the men in pits, because I love the masculine energy, and wish I was more part of it.  

I also found that growing up as a teen, and now as an adult, I mimic traditionally masculine behaviours more than feminine behaviours. I distinctly recall mimicking Renton from Trainspotting's [pose](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/e5/ae/db/e5aedb63e0f8b65dc67c5f85215ea5b4--trainspotting-poster-renton-trainspotting.jpg) and purposefully lowering my voice around male peers to break out of the ""like other girls"" mould.  

I look at all male hardcore bands and wish I looked more like them, [aesthetically](http://www.fearlessrecords.com/fearlessrecords/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/movements_10000.jpg) but also ROCK a dress and love getting made up.  

Basically, around women I feel out of place and not feminine/pretty enough, and awkward, and around men I feel tiny and too femme and I envy them.

I am so confused and wish there was a way to tell if I don't like being cis because I am NOT CIS, or because I am so desperate to be ~different~ and NOT ME.   It might be fruitful to mention that my best friend is MTF Trans; but I met them AFTER I started questioning at 18 (1.5 years later-ish?) so I am not sure that is a factor here.

2018-01-07 22:56:08,7ou2nq,5,13,"So, a bit of background

When I was growing up, there was very little discussion of sexuality, gender, identity, etc. As a result, I didn't do much questioning and there wasn't really anyone I could ask. So, when I went to the bathroom or showered, and was kinda grossed out by my genitals, I figured that was completely normal. Or, when I saw a woman in a dress and wondered what I might look in it, I figured everybody had feelings like that. Come to find out, that is not really the case. But, nevertheless, I never thought that my feelings were strong enough to warrant any meaningful deviation from the norm.

Even after the increased in trans awareness over the past few years, I still did not see myself as a part of that group if only because many of the stories, and the way they were presented all seemed to come across in the same way. ""I always knew I was X despite constantly being told I was Y, but now, I am able to realise my true self."" But since I was not entirely certain, or did not feel as strongly about my identity growing up, I felt that I did not belong in said group. It seemed as though if I was a particular way, I would know it, or would at least have always suspected. Since I didn't, I figured I wasn't.

It's also hard to know whether or not my feelings ""qualify"" me as part of these groups because when asked what dysphoria or whatever else feels like, people find it hard to describe. So, here I am, wondering if what I'm feeling is similar to what others feel, and neither of us can describe what that feeling is.

Anyway, over the last few years I've been interrogating how I feel about certain things, and begun to suspect that I might be nonbinary. But, since the ""feelings"" that make me think this do not present all the time, when they are in remission, of sorts, I begin to doubt whether or not they were ever really there at all. I visit the LGBT Resource center where I go to school in the hopes that the environment might bring them about. But, all I see around me are people who feel completely certain in who they are. And all it reminds me of is how certain I am not. And let me just say that I understand there is no way of knowing how someone really feels based on their outward appearances, but still. I continue to feel out of place.

A while back, I watched [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_alNELGiHI) video and in the description was a link to [this](http://garote.bdmonkeys.net/bsri.html?A1=3&amp;B1=6&amp;C1=6&amp;A2=6&amp;B2=3&amp;C2=2&amp;A3=4&amp;B3=5&amp;C3=6&amp;A4=6&amp;B4=3&amp;C4=5&amp;A5=4&amp;B5=6&amp;C5=4&amp;A6=5&amp;B6=6&amp;C6=2&amp;A7=2&amp;B7=4&amp;C7=5&amp;A8=6&amp;B8=6&amp;C8=2&amp;A9=2&amp;B9=5&amp;C9=6&amp;A10=2&amp;B10=5&amp;C10=2&amp;A11=1&amp;B11=6&amp;C11=6&amp;A12=3&amp;B12=3&amp;C12=2&amp;A13=2&amp;B13=4&amp;C13=3&amp;A14=4&amp;B14=2&amp;C14=6&amp;A15=6&amp;B15=6&amp;C15=3&amp;A16=1&amp;B16=2&amp;C16=5&amp;A17=2&amp;B17=2&amp;C17=3&amp;A18=1&amp;B18=2&amp;C18=4&amp;A19=2&amp;B19=6&amp;C19=6&amp;A20=2&amp;B20=6&amp;C20=2) quiz. Upon its completion, I received this message

&gt;You scored 36.667 out of 100 masculine points, 56.667 out of 100 feminine points, and 50 out of 100 androgynous (neutral) points.

I bring all of this up because, following a long ""drought"" I was feeling particularly femme for longer than the few hours that I had previously been used to, and, it had been so long since those feelings had come about that I was confused at first when I noticed them. Anyway, they were really pleasant and, while they were there, I really wished I had a dress to put on or something. Unfortunately, the way things are, it would be deemed very inappropriate, and, even if it didn't, because of the way the binary is constructed, and ingrained, to dress in a way that deviates, or is deemed deviant (ie, be read as male and wear a dress) is to commit (ie claim that you now want to be perceived in a particular permanently.) I guess since I feel very nebulous about the situation, I do not want to dress a particular way, thus making a declaration of sorts, only to retract later.

In the short time that I have been on this sub, I have read about similar experiences others have had, which seem very similar to mine. I hope that maybe some who have, or are currently dealing with something similar might be able to provide me with insight or strategies they've used, or are trying, to navigate this...confusion? Uncertainty? Whatever. Thank you in advance to those who take the time to read this and to those who decide to respond. I appreciate it, and I appreciate you.

I do, however, have sexual desires for fictional characters, and even what I could hesitantly call love, a sort weird fluttery hot feeling in my chest when I see art of them, bringing me to my next point, the fact that I'm only truly attracted to 2D art, mostly furry stuff at that.

All in all I figured it was a pretty basic autochorrisexual experience, until gay furry porn, which very often features extremely feminine men, began to interest me, in such a way that it became my go to thing for sexual release instead of straight art.

 Now at first I thought it was simply because those boys were so girly and not even human to begin with that my brain couldn't tell the difference. But the more I browsed the more introspection I forced upon myself. I figured out rather early on that I didn't just like looking at girly furry dudes, I wanted to be one, I wanted to be someone's little sub, their toy, to be called a girl and thrown around. Only, I never could figure out if this was a desire that existed In real life or should stay in my head like most things of this nature.

I had heard a lot about sexual roleplay from my friends in the furry community, at first I was hesitant because there was still another person there, even if I couldn't see them, but eventually I got past my anxieties and loaded up Omegle one afternoon, ""18/yo,Bi, M, red fox"" I said when my partner asked for my species and orientation, my character had yet to take proper shape back then, my partner was a big, dominant bear.

My hands were so sweaty I felt I could Short my keyboard, but I had written some erotica privately before and it couldn't be too much different... and it really wasn't, I told him my preferences and he threw me on the bed and owned me. whispering into my fuzzy ears, about how I was such a good ""girl"". It was literally my first sexual experience of any kind with another human being and, slightly misanthropic, asexual-identifying me, had to admit... I really liked it.

In the weeks after that, I RP,d any moment I could, my character evolved and I woke up a latent crossdressing fetish i always suspected, I was put in miniskirts and on a leash, slapped and called all kinds of nasty names, and I loved it.

The still-growing problem I'm dealing with even today is, however, when I look up from that screen and into a mirror, there are no big, shiny eyes and sharp, soft ears, no deliciously androgynous body and cute fluffy tail. But instead a depressed-looking
Fellow who has recently started growing facial hair at a decent rate and who can't gain a single pound.

I've unfortunately grown to be shocked and disturbed by my own body in recent months, I can't reconcile my personality with this body, I remember once I tried to shave my legs just to help a little. But the blade was dull and I had prickly feelings all day instead of smoothness. I came to loathe the idea of masculine and feminine things being seperate even more than I already had, and for better or worse, nearly worshipping androgyny as a concept and the highest thing I could attain. One of my friends is beautifully androgynous and as much as Iove him, I do get pangs of jealousy.

I can't stop thinking about how I could possibly look more androgynous without worrying my family, they already suspect some kind of eating disorder because I'm just very skinny. I really don't think I count as transgender. I feel the opposite of a strong inclination towards one side or the other, I just hate having this hairy body and square-ish face structure, doesn't feel like me and is leaving me very, very confused.

Perhaps I've rambled, but I needed to get this internal struggle out somehow, I hope I don't come off as ignorant or unnecessary.

2018-01-10 06:20:41,7pdqnm,4,6,"Hey all! I'm AMAB and recently getting into femme clothing and presentation, and I really want to get some breast forms to wear until I can start on HRT. I have a model I'm interested in getting but the D cups are sold out everywhere, which is what I had initially been planning on getting because the rule of thumb I hear is ""if you're over 6 feet, D is about right"" so now I'm trying to choose between C or E cups. My inclination is towards C because I feel like going too large won't look the way I want, but I also want it to show up enough to look like boobs and not just big pecs. The problem is that I'm 6' 4"", 240 lbs and pretty lean (the weight I think comes from muscle built in the metal shop I work in, and also the fact that I am unfortunately broad shouldered which makes it harder for me to not get read as male) so I feel like C cups have a good chance of being too small on me, but I don't want to overdo it either. I also intend to do anaerobic workouts to keep on as much muscle as I can once I do start HRT since I do like my strength and it is useful for the job I currently do, so even after HRT I should hopefully not shrink too much, which should mean that the forms won't look too much bigger as HRT starts to kick in before I have my own natural breasts.

In any case, anyone have any opinions?

I am a biological female who loves women. I’ve been having confused thoughts about my gender since about 1 and a half year ago, although I always knew I wasn’t the classic girl/woman/whatever. I haven’t talked to anyone about this yet, please be kind, I need help.

At first it was my body, my very feminine hips especially. But now, now things have taken a weird turn. 

In the past 12 months I got my heart broken twice. The first time it was from a woman I was totally crazy for, who unfortunately for my “lesbian-presenting” self was straight, and kept teasing me while I was desperately lost for her. The second time, it was from a bi girl, who left me for totally different reasons. 

The point is: in both this relationships I felt that things would have been different if I was a man. With the first one I kept thinking to myself that if I was a man we would be dating for sure and happy, and all of the suffering that I was going through would have not happened. When I was with the second girl I used to think something like: “well she’s bi, so she can love me even if a become a man”.

Today, about a month after the second girl broke up with me, I saw a woman give birth at the hospital where I work. After the baby was born the nurse brought the baby to her face and you could fill the love in the room. The thing is: this girl reminded me so much of my ex, that is was painful to watch. I had to step away. At that moment a thought crossed my mind that I will never be able to get any girl pregnant, because I am not a man and I never will be. And this just augmented the pain. 

I don’t know what to make of all of this. I don’t know if I only have these thoughts because I am heartbroken, or because truly I am trans, or non binary or somewhere I still can identify in the gender spectrum. 

I am so scared of talking about this with anyone in my life, because I am not sure they will understand. I don’t live in a country where this is an argument of discussion at all.

2018-01-12 05:15:05,7puet7,21,9,"I am amab, have been on hrt for 14 months. I came out as a trans woman and started my transition about a year and half ago when I was 29, I will be 31 soon.

I thought that was it though, I am amab and grew up and was well into adult with everyone I knew, myself included, thinking I was, in fact, male.

I obviously realized that wasn't true, I realized that I am transgender.

**COOL**

Well now what? I thought at the time. I rushed into hrt, rushed into all of it and you know what? I love the changes. I recently changed my legal name and gender marker so even the govt recognized me as female even when my family doesn't.

**WEIRD**

But now here I am, questioning my gender again. I'll be honest, I don't understand nonbinary genders. I just don't. I respect it and I've known enbies and never had issue using gender neutral language and pronouns. That's easy but I still don't understand the gender.

And yet somehow I'm starting think that I might be nonbinary. I love that my body now has most of the qualities of a typical female body. I love my curves and my breasts and my softness. I love the changes in my facial features. I love that I smile more now. I love that I cry more now. When I get to have srs one day, I will love my new parts.
***
And that is what confuses me. How can I be nonbinary if I love the features of my body that are specific to a binary gender? But I remember the first time someone asked me my pronouns. I remember the conflict I felt. Sitting in a coffee shop at a bdsm munch, having been out to everyone in my life and no one questioning my femaleness ever.

And I think no one ever asked me my pronouns because I was obviously female...right? But I honestly hesitated after the question and very nearly said she/her they/them. But I didn't, just stuck to the female pronouns.

I was excited at first to pass as female to complete strangers. I was excited to wear things like skirts and dresses and see a very feminine figure in the mirror. But that wore off and now when I dress very femme, it just feels wrong.
***
I find myself most comfortable when wearing more androgynous clothing like jeans, a tank top, leather jacket, and chucks. Like everything I'm wearing but the shoes might be women's clothing but it's definitely not femme.

But when I dress like that I feel awesome and bad ass and confident. For a while, since I am also a lesbian, I thought that maybe I could give the whole butch aesthetic a try but the idea of wearing purposely masculine clothing makes me feel dysphoric.

I also almost kinda feel like it'd be cool be like a pre-pubescent person again. Like, that sounds weird I know and I hope this isn't creepy. I hope at least someone here might understand. I remember being very thin and baby-faced and having the features of an adolescent but not an adult...and I liked that. I still want to have sex and be sexual which is why the idea of being physically like someone who is pre-pubescent kinda creeps myself out.

But like, I wanna be an adult child...I guess? Fuck I don't even know. But aside from breasts, I like the idea of not having characteristics associated with either gender. I don't mind people seeing me as female even if that's inaccurate though.
***
So I guess the big question is: Can I be a nonbinary gender but still want a body that is visibly female? Can I be nonbinary and not have a strong desire for gender neutral pronouns?

I came out as a trans woman and started my transition about a year and half ago when I was 29, I will be 31 soon.\n\nI thought that was it though, I am amab and grew up and was well into adult with everyone I knew, myself included, thinking I was, in fact, male.\n\nI obviously realized that wasn't true, I realized that I am transgender.\n\n**COOL**\n\nWell now what? I thought at the time. I rushed into hrt, rushed into all of it and you know what? I love the changes. I recently changed my legal name and gender marker so even the govt recognized me as female even when my family doesn't.\n\n**WEIRD**\n\nBut now here I am, questioning my gender again. I'll be honest, I don't understand nonbinary genders. I just don't. I respect it and I've known enbies and never had issue using gender neutral language and pronouns. That's easy but I still don't understand the gender.\n\nAnd yet somehow I'm starting think that I might be nonbinary. I love that my body now has most of the qualities of a typical female body. I love my curves and my breasts and my softness. I love the changes in my facial features. I love that I smile more now. I love that I cry more now. When I get to have srs one day, I will love my new parts.\n***\nAnd that is what confuses me. How can I be nonbinary if I love the features of my body that are specific to a binary gender? But I remember the first time someone asked me my pronouns. I remember the conflict I felt. Sitting in a coffee shop at a bdsm munch, having been out to everyone in my life and no one questioning my femaleness ever.\n\nAnd I think no one ever asked me my pronouns because I was obviously female...right? But I honestly hesitated after the question and very nearly said she/her they/them. But I didn't, just stuck to the female pronouns.\n\nI was excited at first to pass as female to complete strangers. I was excited to wear things like skirts and dresses and see a very feminine figure in the mirror. But that wore off and now when I dress very femme, it just feels wrong.\n***\nI find myself most comfortable when wearing more androgynous clothing like jeans, a tank top, leather jacket, and chucks. Like everything I'm wearing but the shoes might be women's clothing but it's definitely not femme.\n\nBut when I dress like that I feel awesome and bad ass and confident. For a while, since I am also a lesbian, I thought that maybe I could give the whole butch aesthetic a try but the idea of wearing purposely masculine clothing makes me feel dysphoric.\n\nI also almost kinda feel like it'd be cool be like a pre-pubescent person again. Like, that sounds weird I know and I hope this isn't creepy. I hope at least someone here might understand. I remember being very thin and baby-faced and having the features of an adolescent but not an adult...and I liked that. I still want to have sex and be sexual which is why the idea of being physically like someone who is pre-pubescent kinda creeps myself out.\n\nBut like, I wanna be an adult child...I guess? Fuck I don't even know. But aside from breasts, I like the idea of not having characteristics associated with either gender. I don't mind people seeing me as female even if that's inaccurate though.\n***\nSo I guess the big question is: Can I be a nonbinary gender but still want a body that is visibly female? Can I be nonbinary and not have a strong desire for gender neutral pronouns?\n\nAnyway, for anyone who read all of that, I thank you. Even if you don't respond, thank you for reading it.

I was born AMAB, but I never really felt like ""one of the guys"". I only really hung out with the boys because that's what was expected, I guess. I was always shy, but I never really contributed to conversations unless it was about video games (cause I'm a nerd). Later, when I was a teenager, I started idolizing the LGBTQ+ community, and hung out with the gay and lesbian kids in the class. Also, I made friends with a lot of the girls, and while my friends mostly wanted to get with them, I really just liked talking to girls. I thought they were friendlier, but I also knew I wasn't a ""girl"" either.

I am a lot more attracted to girls than guys, (like 90/10 split) and I dress mostly in dark clothes, jeans, and a t shirt almost all the time, I'm a big person, with a big beard, and I am perfectly fine with that, not really any physical dysphoria. But also, I don't feel attached to that either. Like, if I really don't think I would feel any different if I were a AFAB. Idk why, but I don't like ""masculine"" words to describe me. I am fine with ""he"", just because I have grown up with it, but I dislike overtly masculine words like ""man"" and ""handsome"". I don't feel nothing when it comes to gender, I just feel... different. I have looked at stuff like Demi and Greygender, but I really don't know. 

my anxiety keeps telling me ""this is literally just what being Cisgender is"" and I would really like some outside opinions.

Obviously this one is correct for me, but feel free to re-use, change etc to match you.

***So, /u/Kuttle just told you they're non-binary!***

Some questions you might have:

**Q. What the heck does non-binary mean?**

A. From the Gender Wiki (gender.wikia.com):

*“Non-binary gender (see also genderqueer) describes any gender identity which does not fit the male and female binary.”*

All gender is a performance, so instead of following someone else’s script, I’m writing my own.

**Q. So what gender are you?**

A. I don’t feel comfortable identifying (or being identified) with any gender.

**Q. Since when?**

A. For many years now I’ve felt uncomfortable being referred to in terms of the gender binary. I’ve used the term non-binary when thinking about myself for about a year.

**Q. Does this change how I talk about you?**

A. Only a little. I use *they* pronouns, for example:
 
*“Is /u/Kuttle here yet?”*

*“I don’t think they’ve arrived yet. They’re not at their desk.”*

It also means you should use non-gendered language, such as “child” instead of son/daughter, “sibling” instead of brother/sister, etc.

**Q. But society categorises people into man or woman / but what about “biological sex” and chromosomes / but my religion says…**

A. I understand that western culture is really hung up on categorising people into either male or female (some other cultures not so much). Gender non-conformity is about stepping outside those things, saying “that isn’t me” and just being who you are without these societal expectations.

**Q. So this a just political thing?**

A. Any gender issue is considered political, so sure. But I didn’t think “You know what, I’m going to fight the patriarchy by changing my gender identity!” What I did think was “This is a thing I’ve been feeling for a really long time and now I’ve worked out what words I want to use to describe it.”

**Q. Are you changing anything about yourself?**

A. You might notice changes in my clothing and other things like hair or makeup.

**Q. Are you still gay?**

A. That one’s kind of complicated. Words like “gay” and “straight” only work within a gender binary.

2018-01-20 13:01:15,7rq95e,8,16,"Hey there, I’m struggling with something at the moment and I wondered if folks in this sub could shed some light on it - any advice or anecdote is appreciated.

Bit of background: 
I’m AMAB, NB, present (physically) entirely masculine/male - I even have a beard. I wear trousers. I don’t wear makeup. However I do not identify as male or female, and I prefer they/them/their pronouns.

Most of my friends and family are aware of this, however they continue to use male pronouns for me - this doesn’t tend to offend me as I know there is no malicious intent. 

My partner considers herself a heterosexual woman. The fact that she’s with me does challenge that somewhat, and it’s something we discuss from time to time, however she doesn’t think it makes any difference - it’s a “I’m with you, and that’s all that matters” kind of thing. 

So we present to the world as a heterosexual couple, one male, one female, but just to be clear - I am a non-binary person.

Now we come to the fun part: we are in our 30s and are now at the time of our lives when a lot of our friends are getting married. And time and time again, we are being invited to gendered events. 
I can’t help but feel a little offended, and even misgendered, by being invited to an all-male event, whilst at the same time I appreciate that my friends might have felt equally awkward about not inviting me. 
Meanwhile my SO is in a bind, because she doesn’t really want to go to an all-female event either, however feels immense pressure to go and be girly.

So... the most recent time I was invited on a stag weekend, I simply said that I wouldn’t be coming. I didn’t make any excuses up, I simply said I wouldn’t feel comfortable at an all-male event, thanks for the invite, nothing personal etc. I tried not to make it all about me - and tried not to offend him. He took it really well actually, although he was disappointed that I wouldn’t be attending, he totally appreciated my honesty.

And now, the weekend is upon us. My SO and I just had an impassioned discussion about it, but ultimately she chose to go and is at the girls event right now. (Needless to say, I was not invited to that).

I am sitting here feeling a whole load of things: I feel disappointed and let-down by my partner, whilst I respect her decision to go to this thing, I can’t help but feel unsupported by her.

So... apologies for the very long message. I have no NB friends in my life, so wondering if anyone out there can share how they have dealt with these tricky situations.

When I first met this person they mentioned in passing they might be non-binary, but female pronouns were fine. I tried to still refer to them as ""them"" as much as I could, just to be respectful. 

Some time passed and they expressed dysphoria over female pronouns and ranted about they wished all their friends wouldn't gender them female.

Addon: I'd probably replace the 'female, but!' with 'female, and!'

Edit: I'm fine with labels, and I'm trying to figure out which ones might fit. It was my therapist who has a vendetta against labels.
---
The long short of it is this; I've been questioning my gender for awhile, and I'm wavering between genderqueer/nonbinary and simply being a cis who's over thinking things.



I don't know where to begin with this. I think my main issue with figuring out my identity is that I am comfortable being seen/identified as a female; however there has been a 'but!' on the end of this sentence for a long time, probably since freshman year [I'm out of HS now]. 



For quite awhile I've had the thought of ""It would be nice if people could see me as female, but! also not"" or ""I want to be female, but! also not"". A convoluted internal conversation where I struggle with the fact that while I'm AFAB and I don't particularly fight against that, yet I do disagree. But not completely. If I was having a conversation with an other world entity and they were like, hey pass the sugar, also what's your gender? I'd say ""I'm female+, like, female but also not?""



A few years ago (like, age 16) I went through a sexual trauma that sent my life into a very weird place. I was 100% sure I wasn't cis. I bought a binder- and wore it- I dressed neutral as possible (I've always had a large chest and hips), and I even went so far as having some people refer to me with he/him or they/them.



But then it... changed?



I finally started processing my trauma, and the feelings just... calmed down. My feelings of 'female, and!' didn't go away completely, but I kind of invalidated myself and said my entire experience was because of my trauma, I'm 10p% cis, stop trying to be a special snowflake.



But the problem is back again? Again, after years of internal silence, I'm having these thoughts of being female+. Of wanting to be. Of wanting to be seen by other people as female, but!



I've reached out to my closest friend about this, and they have been very supportive. They're a binary trans person themself, which is part of why I went to them, thinking they would have some opinions? Maybe? 



They've pointed out that it doesn't really line up, to them, that I still want to be female. At least partially. And that I have 0 desires to me a man or be masculine. And just. Well, it's put a strain on things, and I regret bringing the topic up.



I tried speaking with an older therapist of mine, who's also a certified gender therapist. They're very against labels and essentially our entire conversation was them going ""Why do you think about these labels? Call yourself gender experimental! Call yourself 'Gender Weird'!"" and basically. TL;DR: I wanted help laying out the pieces of my puzzle, not be given bags to put the pieces in.



I'm just. I just spend my days flip flopping on myself. One day I'm confident that yes, I'm genderqueer! It is a relief to call myself that! Isn't it great that I've finally figured out part of the puzzle?



And then there are the days after, where I wake up feeling sick at the idea that I've actually told people I'm questioning my gender, feeling nothing but absolute guilt at opening this door because why would I? Aren't I Just A Girl? I'm cis, there's nothing else to it! I should never have started this conversation! What an embarrassing waste of peoples' time.



But there's. Just. Growing up, I wasn't particularly attached to either gender. I recognize that now. I was raised in a very accepting and welcoming home, with parents who have made mistakes from ignorance, not malice. Child me would wear dresses one day, and a shirt with bugs glued to it the next. Who cared? I was a small child. But I would also insist, fervently, that blue was my favorite color, because I knew that's a ~boy thing, and I wanted to be a bit more like a boy.



Skip ahead a few years, and now I'm at the age everyone else starts dressing up, getting training bras, and exploring makeup. I didn't care. At all. I had way more important things going on, and I remember being very uncomfortable with my body's developments. Makeup was something I thought was silly, felt gross, and looked wrong on me. But most of all, I disliked 'dressing nice'. Dress felt fake. I felt like a fraud. Like a mistake. Wearing heels made me feel panic. 'Makeup' was unnatural and anxiety inducing.



I avoided dressing up for quite a few years.



Skip ahead more time. Now I've begun to force myself to wear dresses, skirts, asking to be bought push up bras because obviously large breasts are what I should aspire to have. A bit of makeup, though I'm yet to get any good at it. Yet it still feels wrong. I feel panicky and gross when wearing dresses. 'Dressing up' isn't enjoyable, it makes me want to cry.



However, I am a girl, duh! Thus I should like this. I should wear these things. So I forced myself to.



More years ahead. I have a makeup collection, and have gotten pretty good at it! I dress extremely feminine some days. I own several heels. I've forced myself to dress up and warp my closet to the point it's not really an option anymore. And I think I made myself numb? I just made myself numb to the discomfort; I want to wear a straight cut jacket with nice pants and a stylish tie, but instead I wear fancy dresses and heels. Because. Just. It's how things ~should be, y'know?



I know part of me is female. I know that. I accept that. That is an important part of my identity. But something else feels... off. Not every day. But some days. Some days I get Dressed Up and put on fancy makeup and wear heels and feel good. And then some days I do that and I feel sick. I want nothing but to scrub my face raw, tear the clothes off and toss out all of the makeup and all of the dresses, and just hide in my bed.



Except that's just. A really dramatic and honest version of it, since I scold myself whenever I have those feelings. Whenever I feel like that I force myself to just get through it.



I don't really know what this post is anymore?

Just.



Does anyone else feel this way? Please. I've been trying to find forums and posts and threads and just someone else who talks about 'Female+' but it seems you have to feel masculine/male at some point to truly not be a cis woman, but it's never been that way. It's always female and. Female + neutral.



Am I just? A confused cis female who's maybe gender nonconforming, not gender queer?

2018-01-29 15:52:29,7tt6r2,6,12,"Hey guys.
A couple of days ago, it was my one-year anniversary of discovering I was trans-gendered and that though being AMAB, my traditional presentation no longer reflected my inner self. I wasn't comfortable wandering around as purely masculine anymore. 
However, a year on and I'm still having severe doubts as to my appearance. I could use some advice from the wonderful fonts of wisdom which are these subreddits. 

I identify as non-binary/androgynous. I once came across a label: 'masculine-androgen' and it resonated so beautifully in my understanding that I almost leaped to my feet and cheered at the time. To put numbers on it, I feel only 65% or so masculine if that makes sense, my feminine-self taking a less significant but undeniable chunk of space in my identity. The issue Ive been having is how to do justice to this new pillar of my identity. I am the only non-binary individual that I know of in my circle. All of my trans friends and family members are firmly in the binary. I've managed to cobble together core components to my appearance that make me feel comfortable but with no other NB people to speak to/compare notes with, I don't know if... I don't know whether I'm doing it wrong or not. Does that make sense? I suppose it doesn't when I come to think about it because everyone has their own unique outlook. But I really get uncomfortable wondering if everyone sees me as a circus.

A brief description may be in order. The biggest components of my look are my breast forms. They were the element I knew from the get-go that were non-negotiable and which I needed to feel like the real me. They're matched to my build (maybe a little smaller) so they're not over-the-top (at least I don't think so).

I try to wear more feminine colours, tones, and styles to try and dilute the masculinity out a bit but it's really tough.

I wasn\'t comfortable wandering around as purely masculine anymore. \nHowever, a year on and I\'m still having severe doubts as to my appearance. I could use some advice from the wonderful fonts of wisdom which are these subreddits. \n\nI identify as non-binary/androgynous. I once came across a label: \'masculine-androgen\' and it resonated so beautifully in my understanding that I almost leaped to my feet and cheered at the time. To put numbers on it, I feel only 65% or so masculine if that makes sense, my feminine-self taking a less significant but undeniable chunk of space in my identity. The issue Ive been having is how to do justice to this new pillar of my identity. I am the only non-binary individual that I know of in my circle. All of my trans friends and family members are firmly in the binary. I\'ve managed to cobble together core components to my appearance that make me feel comfortable but with no other NB people to speak to/compare notes with, I don\'t know if... I don\'t know whether I\'m doing it wrong or not. Does that make sense? I suppose it doesn\'t when I come to think about it because everyone has their own unique outlook. But I really get uncomfortable wondering if everyone sees me as a circus.\n\nA brief description may be in order. The biggest components of my look are my breast forms. They were the element I knew from the get-go that were non-negotiable and which I needed to feel like the real me. They\'re matched to my build (maybe a little smaller) so they\'re not over-the-top (at least I don\'t think so).

2018-01-31 22:18:12,7udt3w,6,3,"I'm AFAB, I consider myself transmasculine for the most part. If 10 was 100% male and 0 was 100% female, I tend to range between 8 and 6, sometimes going as high as 9 or as low as 5 or 4. Occasionally I can be a mix (like 8 and 4 at the same time) but that's pretty rare. Here's some of my ideas:

Genderflux: This seemed right if it meant I can range from male to andro, with varying intensity. The issue is some sources are saying because I'm AFAB it would mean I have to flux between feminine identities, so maybe not correct? Also might not be it because of the occasional 4

Genderfluid: I don't like how this implies that I'd be much more, well, fluid than I actually am. Like for me a 4 might look female but still have none of the primary sex characteristics and would still be on the andro leaning femme side.

Demiboy: Don't think it accounts for the fluidness, or the andro parts. Also I just don't really click with the name?

Genderqueer/non-binary/transmasculine: Technically accurate but hoping for something a bit more specific.

Anyone have any ideas, or want to correct me on my understanding on these ideas? I would really appreciate the help!

2018-01-31 22:39:10,7udynx,14,43,"I’ve come out to myself about 6 months ago. I’m a 22yo AFAB who is non binary. In my mind, I am sort of just in the middle. Personality tests told me I have a masculine thought process, and I’ve always considered myself being sort of male since childhood.

Anyway that’s just a fact that I know, and I’ve always known. Still, when I have tried to tell anyone they just don’t believe me. Nobody ever have. I’ve been told I’m just another chick who wants to hang out with the guys, or that I want to be a special snowflake. 

I live in a liberal country that is not educated enough about the trans community. So everyone think they are accepting while in reality they really aren’t. At least not in my case.

But I’m okay with feminine pronouns and I can accept having a female body. At least for the most part. My true dysphoria is socially. I can’t stand it when someone expects me to act feminine, or when other people gender me socially. I live in a male dominated world (I study computer science) and I have to prove myself twice as much to earn half the recognition. And if I don’t act modest and timid then a lot of men tend to be disrespectful towards me. Asshats. They expect me to be so freakin caring and bat my eyelashes at them when I really want to call them an effin dickbag for treating me like their secretary. I’m not sure if this is a problem for all genders, or if it’s even gender related. But I hear a lot of women complaint about similiar things, so I draw my conclusions.

So just because no one believes me I’ve considered just not coming out at all. The only thing I would REALLY want to change is my name, but I can’t really do that since the name I’d choose is 99.9% male name from Finland (I wonder who that 0,1% person was) and it would be weird for other people to call me that unless I transitioned completely. So I’m going to just do my own thing, then. I’m going to act and dress masculine when I feel like it, or even feminine if I want to. I don’t need to explain myself, as it’s nobody’s buisness. Tomorrow I am going to get that tie with pineapples on it that I really want.
