2018-07-02 06:16:42,8vgf4x,1,3,"So I would like to apologize in advance if this seems like a massive stream of consciousness thing, because it is.

Anyway, I have been thinking of how I identify lately and attempting to determine where I lie on the trans\* spectrum. Namely with regards to how I describe myself to others and to myself. You see I am undergoing HRT and my goal is to eventually undergo full genital reconstruction, hair removal except for head, et cetera. That is to say that I desire to, as much as is possible, transition to a place where I would be if I were AFAB as I have found that thus far the limited steps in that direction have made me feel far, far less dysphoric. While I at the same time do not intend to change my clothing style much, or become more stereotypically feminine in my interests. Basically I absolutely adore suits, hiking, and computer science.

In general I am of the opinion that the purpose of labels is to compress data and that the goal of a good label is to maximize compression while still being accurate and comprehensible to who you are talking to. So from this perspective it would indeed be accurate to describe myself as a woman assuming that definition is of the generally accepted inclusive variety and not one of the more exclusionary definitions supported by transphobes, etc. However, clearly simply having interests that may by cultural gender roles be defined as masculine does not make a person a man, just as feminine interests do not make a person a woman. While stereotypical actions may be gender affirming, I suspect it is very much a culturally related and not related to gender identity. Thus again, clearly by a modern, efficient definition of womanhood I would be a woman.

But at the same time I do not entirely feel that it is accurate to describe myself as a woman. I feel like I would be in a place where I have no particular reason to be in and would not really fit in. But at the same time I am arguably far further away from men than anything else, even if right now my transition may have been limited.

I'm afab bi-gender (binary male/masc and binary female/femme with no neutral middle), and all my life I've always known I'm bi-sexual (consciously repressed and closeted), but my sexuality has always puzzled me. I'm far more attracted to men (androsexual) than women (gynosexual), in that I'm strongly attracted to the idea of sex with a woman and always have, including some childhood experimentation with a friend, but I've yet to meet a woman in person whom I actually want to be intimate with.

But I totally missed a huge piece of my sexuality by concentrating on who I am attracted *to*.

I never thought about who I am attracted *as*.

This week I finally figured it out. Whether I am on a full fem swing, or a full masc swing, I am usually a gay guy with bi-interest. Even when I'm totally a girl in every other way, sexually I am having sex from the male POV. Occasionally I take on the girl role, but generally I have to imagine I have a penis (easier after a year on T, :D ), and I desire sex with men (and women) as a man.

Before I ""came out to myself"" as non-binary transgender, it was perhaps 70F/30M (which I really didn't want to admit to myself, but knew anyway), but once I acknowledged my guy side, my interest in receiving PIV sex as a woman waned, I'm sexually more 90M/10F now.

I actually came out to my mom and sister as trans* about six or seven months ago, and was pushed back into the closet (I was told, in an indirect way, that ""it's just a phase"").  I hadn't yet told them my pronouns and name I wanted to use, as I was closeted again. After that, I believed what they said and started presenting feminine to make them, and hopefully me, happy.

A month or two ago, I decided screw it. I got out my binder and started binding again, thinking I'd go by they pronouns after I move out. Name changing didn't cross my mind until recently. I have a very feminine name, and kind of decided to just accept it and keep it. A few weeks passed, and I got sick of it being so gendered, and started considering a genderless name change.

And then I remembered: my mom has my name tattooed on her.

If I were to change my name, I think I'd be A) Shunned by my family, B) Ignored and dead named, C) Disowned, or D) all of the above. 

So, my question is: should I keep my name, or change it?
I'm all for changing my name. I have several names picked out, but I'm not sure how I'd explain it to family. I've thought about changing my also gendered middle name and going by that, or just using a genderless nickname.
At the same time, my name has been used as far as I know by one male fictional character. This was partially why I had decided to start IDing as nb again. I could use my legal name, but I lie awake at night realizing that I'm addressed as she because of my name.

Thanks for reading my rant. Any advice is welcome.

But my presentation is not and will never be very masculine as it's not my thing.  I'm still strongly questioning who I am. I think I do experience gender dysphoria (both social and body dysphoria). I don't have diagnosis though. But I think I can deal with it without medical intervention at least for now.

Right now I'm wondering whether I'm (feminine) binary trans guy, nonbinary trans guy or even just a transvestite (with some extra issues). My main doubt about my identity revolves around dysphoria, because of 1. it doesn't seem to be as intense as the case is with some binary trans guys whose stories I've heard 2. it doesn't seem to be as coherent as the case with some binary trans guys (for example, quite weak bottom dysphoria, some secondary sex characteristics like facial hair doesn't seem necessary to me, but dysphoria around my feminine body shape and feminine face is noticeable). So I feel like I had no right to call myself binary trans guy. Especially without diagnosis and acute need for transitioning.

2018-07-03 23:30:25,8vwwmj,5,11,"AMAB, with gynecomastia. I sometimes feels like a boy and sometimes feels like a girl.   Like when I was a kid, I got bored and said to my mum ""mum, today I want to be a girl!"" My mum would give me some of her clothes, and then I would play like a girl.   

Later I sometimes also took my mum's clothes myself without asking her. But at puberty I found when I wore her clothes thinking I was a beautiful girl I got erections. I knew girls don't have erections and was confused and afraid. I was scared that my mum would find out. If she found out, what would she say to me?! I could not imagine. Probably she would see me as a pervert? It seemed to me that if I wanted to be a girl, I could not have my male part, and otherwise I could not be a girl. So I stopped playing the ""mum, today I want to be a girl"" game.   

I feel it's like losing some great fun, kind of a regret, but I do not have dysphoria and I'm OK with being a guy. Each time I want to play the ""mum today I want to be a girl"" game, I would go online search for sex-change information. It could be fantasy, practical information, or porn. I have learnt a lot and am still gaining more and more knowledge about sex change. Besides, I will fantasise that I have a flat crotch and a vagina, and was being taken care of, dominated, loved and penetrated by a tall and muscular guy. Or I was playing scissoring with a girl. Just by fantasising and playing with my boobs (remember, I have gynecomastia) I could achieve multiple small orgasms. Like sudden electricity flows from the tip of my penis, only lasting 1 second, but could come many times in a row. I don't even need to touch my penis. It's far less intense than a full blown male orgasm, but it still feels really good.

I used to have a room mate. I think I was in love with him and he was also in love with me. We use to do a lot things together and before we slept we used to talk with each until one of us felt into sleep. We even took showers together sometime, and he used to comment on my boobs and nipples. Like ""Wow, they are so big!"" In front of him, I think I exhibited my feminine side a lot more than usual. We kind of accepted each other the way we were. We didn't need to hide. But I couldn't physically get closer to him. I felt if I were a girl I would definitely want to have sex with him. I felt if I were to have sex with him, I was gonna offer him a vagina not a penis or anus. So we never had sex.   

Sometimes when I read success stories of post-op woman, or seeing their post-op bodies, not only the vagina folds, but also boobs, curvy hips and smooth skin, I am a bit jealous, because I couldn't have those. I am also jealous of those who have female voices. I've tried some ""voice therapy"" to sound more like a girl, so that it feels more real when I want to be a girl. My effort has not been successful. But anyway, I am happy for those transwomen, for they've got what they've been wanting so much. I think in the future if sex-change could be reversible, then I would definitely give it a try.   

For the rest of the time, I am just a guy. It's like 80&amp;#37; of the time I feel like a guy and 20&amp;#37; of the time I wish I were a girl. I had a girlfriend. When having sex, I was totally OK with being a guy. When I felt like being a girl, we would watch post-op transwoman porn and I would imagine I was the post-op transwoman. It's like they are my proxy, living a fantasy of mine. My ex-gf was fine with it and would sometimes tease me of being a girl. We broke up for other reasons.

Firstly: This person expressed that she was fine with all pronouns and doesn't mind gender-aligned descriptions, so me using female pronouns and calling her a ""girl"" isn't out of disrespect for her identity.

Secondly: I'm not trying to gatekeep or invalidate her. I just really need to get this off my chest.

So I'm AFAB nonbinary, have been for a long time. But I am not comfortable with being femme at all and I don't really enjoy androgyny. I'm on T and bind, planning on top surgery eventually. I don't use the term demiboy but for a quick explanation that's probably the closest estimation.

And one of my friends mentioned in facebook that she was non binary. And I don't want to sound like a gatekeeper but the way she has been handling it makes me very uncomfortable.

She explained to me that she basically doesn't believe gender exists, it's all social conditioning, and basically invoked the whole ""nothing's real and nothing matters"". She presents exclusively fem and is fine with any and all pronouns, because ""gender is a lie anyway"".

Which.....idk but I find the ""gender is fake"" stance to be really invalidating towards trans people in general, actually? Like by saying gender isn't real, you're saying that my identity isn't real and transwomen aren't women and etc. etc......it really rubs me the wrong way. My gender is an expensive exhausting pain in my ass I don't want you telling me it's not real.

Meanwhile, I had to unfollow her on facebook because multiple times a day she posts aggressive and accusatory messages about social issues that became too much for me. I have been accused by nearly everyone I know of being too much if an ""SJW"" and even I couldn't stand how viciously this person acts.

So I'm not trying to make any statements about her, not really. I'm trying to figure out something about myself. Why do I hate her so much? I think it's cause like, my dysphoria can be crippling and my dad stopped talking to me and everytime I interact with someone I'm anxious because I don't really pass as anything right now and I know they'll misgender and I'll be uncomfortable. Meanwhile, she basically just slapped the term on for the sake of perpetuating her social idea that ""gender isn't real"", and it hasn't affected her life at all. Really, I get upset at the idea of us having the same label. Our experiences are so completely different and I feel like she makes me look less valid.

2018-07-05 04:29:03,8w7olk,2,78,"So... Yeah. As the title says, I'm amab and have been going through the full transition process for almost two years now. I've been on a full dose of HRT (T-blockers + estrogen) for about a year and a half and have been loving the effects. I've got FFS scheduled to happen in about 3 months and I *just* got my bottom surgery scheduled for the very beginning of next year.

Anyways, I was going through my wardrobe tonight messing with new outfit combinations and found some of my old ""guy"" clothes that I haven't worn in a while. For whatever reason, I thought ""fuck it"" and threw on a pair of jeans, put on a sports bra to compress my (small) chest, threw on a t-shirt and then tied up my hair under a benie so that it looked short. 

When I saw myself at first there was an expected wave of dysohoria, I looked almost exactly the same as before I started transitioning (just better groomed and maybe a little prettier). Then, for the hell of it, I grabbed a jean vest that I had lying around and threw it on too. The vest was new, I never used to wear things like it before. This one was something I could never work into my more feminine styles though.

I don't know why or how, but when I saw myself with the vest on, it's like it kinda changed everything. I *really* liked how I looked (though I could feel myself terrified to admit it). Clearly boyish, but with this feminine flair or something. I don't know how to describe it, but it was *different*. I sent a picture to my friend who said I looked ""confident and hot"" and that's honestly how I felt.

I don't know. I definitely didn't feel like a guy/man and I still dont. But wearing the outfit and seeing myself, girl/woman also wasn't quite right. I didn't feel like a butch girl or anything. I know I still want bottom surgery (I hate that part of myself so much...) and I'm *pretty* sure I still want FFS too.

I'm like a dead in the middle both/neither, which meeeeeaaaaaannnnnnnnssssssss I get to deal daily with even binary trans people telling me that it's bullshit, that I don't exist, etc. etc. 

I prefer male titles (mr., sir, dad, etc.) and I'm somewhat pronoun indifferent (with a preference of he and they) and I love presenting as a mix. My ideal body is... Not very gendered. I don't want genitals (sounds weird I know, but I can't stand the idea of having either, I wish there was just nothing), and I hate having breasts and being shaped the way I am, despite being ""conventionally attractive"" in a female perspective. There are bits of me I want to transition, and bits of me I never want to change. Essentially, my experience being NB is like a shitty paint job; splotchy and inconsistent dysphoria, and I feel like everyone just wants to pretend they don't see me. 

I feel so pressured to try and conform in my day to day life. I'm ""female"" where my family and coworkers want me to be. I'm ""male"" with friends who don't get what nonbinary is, or say it's fake, because at least they can understand ""male"" and understand that I'm not female. I'm ""nonbinary,"" myself, only around 2 or 3 of my closest friends. It's been so fucking irritating. I feel like no matter where I turn I'll always just keep having to act out these roles for people. I don't get to dress how I want anymore because I'm so stressed out about binary people coming to the conclusion I'm just faking my struggles, in it for the attention, etc. I feel like shit all the time because life is just god damn exhausting. If I choose to be """"""fully trans"""""" and live as a man I'll probably be uncomfortable with what I put myself through to get there (i.e., hormone changes, I worked way too hard for my singing voice (singing helps me cope with depression) to change it and mess it up.) If I choose to live as a cis woman, I'll keep having to play out this shitty act that I'm content with what I was born into. I'll have to keep being called names I don't want, I'll have to keep being trapped in this stupid body, and I'll have to go back to being everything I forced myself to be before. 

I didn't ask for this and I hate it and it causes me so much distress on a daily basis.

Sorry for being such a downer, but I have no idea where else to turn with this. I feel like NB peoples' struggles get undermined way too much because we don't have this conventional image that people are used to like binary genders. Binary cis people are able to look at themselves and be comfortable from day 1, their gender matches what they have and they don't want it to be different. Binary trans people can look at themselves and know they want the \*other\*. But I feel like no matter what my binary options are I can't find comfort and it sucks. Some people just refuse to try and understand this, others aren't capable of understanding, and I'm so tired. 

I don't know what to do about it anymore. I don't even want to leave my house most days because it's just so mentally exhausting. Anyone have tips for coping with shit like this?

I\'m ""male"" with friends who don\'t get what nonbinary is, or say it\'s fake, because at least they can understand ""male"" and understand that I\'m not female. I\'m ""nonbinary,"" myself, only around 2 or 3 of my closest friends. It\'s been so fucking irritating. I feel like no matter where I turn I\'ll always just keep having to act out these roles for people. I don\'t get to dress how I want anymore because I\'m so stressed out about binary people coming to the conclusion I\'m just faking my struggles, in it for the attention, etc. I feel like shit all the time because life is just god damn exhausting. If I choose to be """"""fully trans"""""" and live as a man I\'ll probably be uncomfortable with what I put myself through to get there (i.e., hormone changes, I worked way too hard for my singing voice (singing helps me cope with depression) to change it and mess it up.) If I choose to live as a cis woman, I\'ll keep having to play out this shitty act that I\'m content with what I was born into. I\'ll have to keep being called names I don\'t want, I\'ll have to keep being trapped in this stupid body, and I\'ll have to go back to being everything I forced myself to be before. \n\nI didn\'t ask for this and I hate it and it causes me so much distress on a daily basis.\n\nSorry for being such a downer, but I have no idea where else to turn with this. I feel like NB peoples\' struggles get undermined way too much because we don\'t have this conventional image that people are used to like binary genders. Binary cis people are able to look at themselves and be comfortable from day 1, their gender matches what they have and they don\'t want it to be different. Binary trans people can look at themselves and know they want the \\*other\\*. But I feel like no matter what my binary options are I can\'t find comfort and it sucks. Some people just refuse to try and understand this, others aren\'t capable of understanding, and I\'m so tired. \n\nI don\'t know what to do about it anymore. I don\'t even want to leave my house most days because it\'s just so mentally exhausting. Anyone have tips for coping with shit like this?\n\nThanks for coming to my ted talk lmao', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': ""(Rant) I really hate being nonbinary, and I don't know what to do about it."", 'created': 1530840004.0}"

I am agender, but would prefer to be in a male body if I got to choose. I have some recurring issues about my identity, not super bad or anything more like ""Wow its annoying to be unsure about this.""

So some background, I have Autism Spectrum Disorder, when I was diagnosed they said it was Aspergers but apparently the term changed...? Anyway, I relate to my body in a weird way.

Not sure if my recurring depression numbed me or what.

So, I did the research and guess I'm transmasculine, and androromantic grey-ace. But, I don't know if that would make me gay or not? Do you need to be AMAB or a trans guy to be gay? And something I've been afraid of is what if I only think I'm trans-masc because I'm attracted to the male body and I'm not really trans?

(Note: this is a personal experience I'm trying to wrestle with, so please don't feel obligated to read and please, please don't be discouraged either...I'm just in a weird situation lol this is not the norm for these things)

I had my consultation with the plastic surgeon yesterday and it was a mix of feeling really prepared and really unprepared.

I was prepared to give myself over an hour to find the office which was 25 minutes away, but was not prepared to actually need that whole hour due to getting lost...showing up 3 minutes before my appointment was stressful as I've never been late to a medical appointment in my life and started panicking that I would miss this one as God's punishment or something lol... (sigh)

But I made it, and was brought to a room where I was told to take off my top and bra (didn't bother with a binder since it takes me thirty years to remove it), which I had been preparing myself for all week. It's top surgery...someone had to look at my chest at some point.

I was not, however, prepared to be informed that there was a resident shadowing my surgeon, so that would be two men looking at my chest and touching me, but I kept reminding myself that viewing my body from a clinical perspective was waaay different than from a sexual one.

I was prepared to discuss my history and why I wanted top surgery...I was not prepared to be told that as soon as we were done chatting, they'd run the insurance request and schedule a second appointment for right before the surgery. I was referred here by my primary care, but I guess....I don't know, I thought I'd have to fight for it or something, but the general vibe I got was, ""This is happening."".

I was not prepared to be measured. 

I was NOT prepared to be measured.

I kind of just turned my head to the wall and tuned everything out, waiting for it to be over. ((Both men were extremely professional and polite---the surgeon would not even move the folds of my gown away but waited for me to do it ----but regardless....I was not prepared to be measured)

They took pictures  (sans face), but only after asking if it was okay....I had signed the consent form to take photos and agreed again when they verbally asked but.....I don't know. Our generation has spent way too much time hearing about tech breaches, and having very specific tattoos didn't help me feel confident about my ongoing anonymity.......although, I don't think I could ever be prepared to have pictures taken of my body like that, even though obviously nothing bad had happened.

I cannot emphasize enough how incredibly wonderful my surgeon was....he was so polite, professional, friendly and easy to talk to, appropriate, everything you could ask for in a stranger that got to walk in and see what nobody except your spouse would ever see.

But then we started talking about the procedure  (the nurse assured me he would go over all the details and answer every single question I had), and I off-handedly laughed when he asked if keeping sensation was important to me, to which I replyed that I'd be fine if he left me with nothing but two scars on my chest. 

He laughed with me and dismissed it at first, but caught something in my response. He gently explained to me that a 100% flat chest is a mastectomy but a male chest is different  (something about the remaining tissue curving a bit to give the definition of muscles or something like that).....and he started asking me quietly (and very gently still), ""Do you want a flat chest or a male chest?""

And he repeated it in the silence as I mentally fought with myself, terrified that if I answered honestly I'd be denied and have my 38D monstrosity forever, and I couldn't risk messing this up when I was so close...

But I stubbornly repeated that I wanted a flat chest because it was the truth and realizing I didn't even want a male chest left me reeling and confused, which I think he picked up on but didn't say anything disparaging.....and he said I was more than welcome to try and push through for the insurance, but I might have a better case if I had gone through a breast surgeon and requested a cautionary mastectomy due to my medical chart being flagged at a high risk for cancer...

He assured me that if I did end up going through his office (with or without insurance), he'd be happy to give me the flat chest I wanted, but warned me it was unlikely insurance would cover since I hadn't socially transitioned yet.......but I explained to him that I can't ever fully socially transition without losing far too much, that hormone treatment was highly unlikely, if ever.....and he concluded that perhaps special circumstances could apply, but that it was up in the air.

I left and was prepared to get lost on the drive home (which I did), but wasn't prepared for the jumble of echoing emotions that were ghosting around me. I was stressed but not overtly so, angry but not feeling vindictive, exposed but not taken advantage of, and just a general sense of being overwhelmed even though I wasn't completely sure why. I felt fine and terrible simultaneously.

All in all, from getting in the car that morning to getting home took a total of four hours, and I more or less haven't stopped shoveling junk food into my mouth since, restlessly moving from one purchase to the next and hoping I can stay distracted. 


I know I need to sit down and talk this through with myself, figure out what's up.....not being able to freely discuss it with anyone around me has left me frustrated as well.......but my spouse does not support me at all and overtly mocks the whole demographic, so I've just been inwardly feing very overwhelmed and confused, wondering if I've been mistaken about things, or if there's any other factor(s) of which I'm not yet aware......but I guess that's a post for another time. 



TL;DR: Do I even want to be a guy? Is my dysphoria linked to gender issues or something else? Stay tuned and maybe we'll both get to find out lol

Now I'm the one asking myself questions. I'm an AFAB person who thought of herself as cis up to this point. I kind of had forgotten that I did heavily question my gender for a long time a few years ago - before I knew gender wasn't a binary. I think part of me wanted to be a trans man just so I could know what was up, but I never ever felt like a man. Back then I ended up thinking that not feeling like a man at all qualified me as a woman, enven though now I can't remember if I ever fully felt like one.

Then I sort of brushed it all under the rug, replaced gender angst with a lot of feminist activism, gender studies and the likes... I somehow even forgot how much I had questioned my gender. In the mean time, I was the one who told my trans woman best friend and my non-binary partner that they were, well, trans. So when I started wondering about myself all I could think was ""how could I just find out about myself NOW, after I've helped two people with that?"" It doesn't really make sense but having taken years to come out as bisexual and watching the youtube channel Contrapoints I now think you can be ""woke"" about something and still be in deep denial about yourself.

Anyway. I'm happy when people get confused about my gender, I'm very uncomfortable with performing feminity (I feel better looking androgynous though I enjoy the occasional sun dress), I honestly wonder if cis people even question their gender... On the other hand I have no body dysphoria and no problem with female pronouns.

More than anything I'm afraid that I've convinced myself I was a woman so deeply that I won't ever know if I really an one? And that I've mixed up the ""gender as an innate sense of identity"" and ""gender as a social construct"" (to me both exist but are very different things, aka gender itself and society-prescribed gender roles) schools of thought too much to be able to know where I'm at.

I saw one way to describe NB is ""some people don't neatly fit into the categories of man or woman, or male or female.‚Äù But I don't understand this.

2018-07-09 10:06:47,8xa7p2,4,21,"And that really fuckin sucks too, like when strangers suck its a small hit, it hurts for a moment, but hey theyre just a stranger with a stupid face and a stupid mouth which they use to spew stupid shit, so you can move forward, sure you might think about it again at some point, but it doesnt matter, theyre just a stupid stranger.

But when someone close to you sucks, youre fucked because when you see them and think about them, you think about the stupid shit they said, and theyre not a stupid stranger, you care about them and their opinions, their stupid fuckin opinions. 

And with some people you know right out they dont support you and that sucks, but yoi know what sucks more? Those people who make you think they support you but they dont. Like for instance my one friend who i first vented to after buying my first binder and how my dysphoria was like fuckin killing me and shit and i fuckin opened up and shit and i croed for like an hour on the phone to her because i just had so much hate for myself and my body and other shit. And i thought she supported me, but i should of fucking knew, the entire time she did ask me questions like ""are you absolutely sure, you might just like the size"" ""wait so you dont wanna be a girl or boy, are yoi sure yoi dont just wanna have smaller boobs?"" ""you really shouldnt spend so much money on a whim"" ""well i guess if youre really committed..."" 

And when i told another friend, whos fucking great by the way hes the fuckin best, my prefered name she got real pissy and shit and at firsr refused to call me it, and really she doesnt, the only time i am is on her fuckin onsta page or some fuckom shit, and i fuckong should of know or when she saod all those timss ""youre not trans"", ""youre not really nonbinary"" but all those times i excuses her, it was okay because she still ""supported me in spirt"" and all that jazz 

But then we had a 'conversation' which was less of me talking and more of ""her telling me what i really feel"" because apparently ""im just a confused girl who wants a flat chest, and the only reason why is because of the assults, its so sad i was assulted, and of course shes here for me now, but if i had never been assulted i wouldnt 'have dysphoria'and id be a perfectly fine girl"" and i just feel like the worlds biggest fuckin idiot that id believe for even a moment she supported me, for a moment i excused saying shed come around to certain aspects and she did support me. 

For a small moment i thought i had things sorted out with my mom, who was extremely upset when ever i tried to convey to her i didnt want afab. Then we finally sat down and actually talked and i explained i wanted to be neither male or female and she said that she waa okay with that, that she'd still love and accept me. 

I sincerely wish she had stopped talking there. She went on to state she was worried id want to get ""the surgery"" on day and how, even though she's ""super progressive and amazing"" and she believes trans people can desire to be the opposite gender, **but** changing your sex is to far, why cant they **keep pretending** to be the opposite gender? (also mom i might not get bottom surgery but I AM getting top surgery on day so youre not out of the field just cause i dont want a dick)I fought the urge to go into full blown argument by reminding myself of the fact she had at least said she was fine with me being nonbinary. 

I sincerely wish i didnt ""push it"" with ""my silly questions"" so i asked if shed use my pronouns, but nah shes already got it in grained to her brain and 'it would just feel weird to refer to you as they'. So i then informed her, not asked, that some of my friends already used they pronouns towards me, 'okay, as long as they dont use it around me, i would feel akward', hey since you accept me can i start binding again with out you yelling at me? ""you know how i feel about that, i just said i accepted you, dont push it"", welp how about hair i really wanna fuckim do something about fuckin dysphoria and shits, ""i have told you time and time again, my dad liked girls with long hair so when i was young it was ingrained to me that girls must have long hair"" BUT I JUST SAID I AM NOT A GIRL AND YOU SAID YOU ACCEPTED THAT. 

but apparently im a bully, im just trying to bully her into giving me what i want. By being depressed im bullying her, by mot leaving my room for days im bullying her, by having dysphoria im bullying her, by cutting myself im bullying her, by asking to see a therapist im bullying her, by trying to kill myself im bullying her, god im such a big bully, i dont do these things because i hate myself and hate livjng and because every day is a fucking chore and sometimes i just cant take it and i hate my bosy amd alllll that fun shit, no, no, no, i do these things to bully her, im such a big bully.

Then we finally sat down and actually talked and i explained i wanted to be neither male or female and she said that she waa okay with that, that she\'d still love and accept me. \n\nI sincerely wish she had stopped talking there. She went on to state she was worried id want to get ""the surgery"" on day and how, even though she\'s ""super progressive and amazing"" and she believes trans people can desire to be the opposite gender, **but** changing your sex is to far, why cant they **keep pretending** to be the opposite gender? (also mom i might not get bottom surgery but I AM getting top surgery on day so youre not out of the field just cause i dont want a dick)I fought the urge to go into full blown argument by reminding myself of the fact she had at least said she was fine with me being nonbinary. \n\nI sincerely wish i didnt ""push it"" with ""my silly questions"" so i asked if shed use my pronouns, but nah shes already got it in grained to her brain and \'it would just feel weird to refer to you as they\'. So i then informed her, not asked, that some of my friends already used they pronouns towards me, \'okay, as long as they dont use it around me, i would feel akward\', hey since you accept me can i start binding again with out you yelling at me? ""you know how i feel about that, i just said i accepted you, dont push it"", welp how about hair i really wanna fuckim do something about fuckin dysphoria and shits, ""i have told you time and time again, my dad liked girls with long hair so when i was young it was ingrained to me that girls must have long hair"" BUT I JUST SAID I AM NOT A GIRL AND YOU SAID YOU ACCEPTED THAT. \n\nbut apparently im a bully, im just trying to bully her into giving me what i want. By being depressed im bullying her, by mot leaving my room for days im bullying her, by having dysphoria im bullying her, by cutting myself im bullying her, by asking to see a therapist im bullying her, by trying to kill myself im bullying her, god im such a big bully, i dont do these things because i hate myself and hate livjng and because every day is a fucking chore and sometimes i just cant take it and i hate my bosy amd alllll that fun shit, no, no, no, i do these things to bully her, im such a big bully.

To cut to the chase, I'm an AFAB genderqueer person, and I've recently been heavily considering looking into taking low doses of T to try to feel more at home in my body. I prefer having a more androgynous look, but my face is so round and soft, as well as my body, that I have a very hard time achieving that through clothing and hair. I also go through periods of time where I just *feel* masc, I don't know how to explain it. However, I don't consider myself to be a trans person - just a genderless person who has a lot of traditionally feminine body traits (sans a big chest). My sex drive is even non-existent, which while I *do* identify as asexual, I can't help but wonder if it has to do with hormones and dysphoria.


I've been feeling very conflicted about attempting hormone therapy, however. It's not so much introspection on how I personally feel about it as it is ideological self-doubt. Things like, ""There are so many transgender people who desperately want to be on hormone treatment and aren't able to, why should I take it when my dysphoria isn't *that* bad?"" ""Do I really feel this way about myself, or am I trying to be ""T  R  E  N  D  Y?"""" 


I know some of this doubt is rooted in discussions in the LGBTQ community from less inclusive members, and some is internalized from my mother, who keeps insisting that she ""had a beautiful daughter and she doesn't make mistakes.""

2018-07-13 04:47:15,8yh1i3,4,23,"Dear /r/NonBinary,

I am a 35 year old AMAB enby.  Earlier this year, I came out to my life partner who is my wife and the mother of my daughter.

I told you about how hard it was for her to accept.  Some of you suggested to me that my wife is a bigot and I might be best off separated from her.  I believe and have faith that she loves me, but she's used to thinking of me as a man that I presented myself as, not some odd trans-non-binary something or another.  It is truly unfair to her that she married me presenting as what I thought I needed to present as instead of how I feel inside.  As a matter of fact, I denied to myself who and what I am.

I do not believe that my wife is a bigot.  I believe that she feels a bit cheated that she didn't get what she thought she was getting.  Time has healed some of the shock from the coming out, but there is more work to do.  She has reassured me that she loves me.  After all, regardless of whatever else I am, I am her loyal husband and the devoted father of our daughter.  She admires me for filling these roles even if my gender identity makes her uncomfortable.

My father, on the other hand, is a bigot.  I don't believe I will ever choose to be ""out"" to him in any sense of the word.  It is quite possible that I will eventually be outed to him, and that is something I dread.  On the other hand, keeping my gender identity a secret from him seems like a heavy burden to bear.  My father is a man who openly hates LGBT people, and the idea that I could be one disgusts him.  I honestly believe that if were to explain to him that I am trans-non-binary, he would likely insinuate that I chose to become something totally disgusting because I hate him and want to hurt him.  His head would explode. (and it would be my fault, at least in his mind)

As for my wife, in spite of her assurances that she loves me, which I do take at face value, it is clear to me that there is a long road ahead.

I love my wife very much.  She is a very devoted wife and she doesn't deserve to have to undertake a difficult personal journey to learn to love her husband as he truly is as opposed to as she wishes he were.  I want to make her happy, but I see her longing for me to be something that I am not, and honestly, it breaks my heart because I believe she deserves to be happy.  We deserve to be happy together.  We've never done anything wrong to hurt anyone.  We just want to enjoy our life together and raise our little daughter to grow into a wonderful person.

I hate to admit it, but it's still difficult for me to love this non-binary part of myself.  As I said in the past, I was taught growing up that transgender people are so disgusting as to be practically beyond words to properly describe how disgusting they are.  I know it's a cliche, but my heart is full of love and I feel disgusted that I had this bigotry drilled into my head.

But back to my wife... she's been saying things lately... It's almost like a passive-aggressive resistance to my gender identity, and it betrays her anxious longing for me to go back into the closet and stay there forever!  Friends, I can't do that.  I don't want to martyr myself for her sake.

The only way that I've seriously thought about permanently modifying my body is I've thought about having my facial hair removed.  I haven't grown a beard in years.  I visited a few places that provide that service and did research about it, and I eventually told my wife, and she wistfully said, ""Oh, but I like your facial hair"", referring to the stubble that I've come to see like a blemish on my skin as a result of gender dysphoria.  I've mentioned it numerous times, and the response is always the same.  It's like I'm threatening to take a favorite toy away from a child.  How could I do that?

I've been growing my hair out a bit.  It's still only several inches long.  For those of you who don't know, the average person's hair grows at a rate of about six inches per year, so if I want a head of hair reaching down to my shoulders, that will take \*years\*.  And yet, it's only been several months since I stopped regularly cutting it short, and she's already making remarks about how ""handsome"" I look with short hair.  Just a few hours ago, she pointed to a picture on the wall taken on our wedding day, telling me how handsome I am with short hair.  Friends, she wants to be married to a man, not an enby.

That doesn't even begin to cover how she feels about my mannerisms.

Honestly, if my wife were to decide that she doesn't like me the way I am, there are very few people out there who seem to like me as I am.  I am an introvert, not a socialite, and most of my friends are ""pen friends"" and ""internet friends"".

I believe then, that the two of us are at a point where she needs to understand that I am an enby and that I never will be (and never truly was) the man she wants me to be.  It is unfair to her that I presented myself to her as something I'm not, and it is unfair to me that I'm facing pressure to be something that I'm not.

I just don't know how to talk to her about it.

The only thing I know to do is to have a very frank talk about it.  Tell her ""This is what I am and I am powerless to change that."" and ""I love you, but you are pressuring me to something that I'm not and it's hurting me, so I need you to stop."" and perhaps, ""Darling, this is what I am and I know it's not what you want, so can you help me understand how I can make it easier for you because you deserve to be happy.""

Hey there. Ah this post is so hard to write. I already tried and deleted it. Anyway. 

I‚Äôm AFAB. (I almost just deleted this post again because this is hard to say and I‚Äôm not sure what to say and ahhh) However I feel like I‚Äôm nothing I guess? I‚Äôm uncomfortable with the assumptions brought along with gender. I feel best being referred to as they/them, and my chosen name (though I haven‚Äôt been able to ask anybody to do this yet). 
I don‚Äôt know if this general sense of unease is dysphoria, and I have this weird bottom dysphoria that comes out when I think about intercourse with women (I‚Äôm bisexual) in which I wish I had male genitalia/ male genitalia feels right at the time. I have no desire or feelings regarding my genitals otherwise. I wish my chest was flat, but I think this is maybe just a preference thing to do with my general unhappiness with my body. 

Spiritually, I feel like people are just people. While I understand that physical sex exists, I don‚Äôt think this should be of note or affect one‚Äôs view of the individual. I guess I see the soul and not the physical form, so gender expression is more just personal expression in my eyes. People should just be accepted for who they are at the base level, without uncontrollable factors being taken into account. However I‚Äôll always respect other‚Äôs pronouns, and understand the importance of using proper pronouns in regards to one‚Äôs well being. I take the way someone identifies as the truth. 

A lot of my hobbies are softer and ‚Äúgirly‚Äù, so that‚Äôs why I guess I ‚Äúdoubt‚Äù myself the most. However, logically I find this ridiculous because interests are genderless and perceived gendering is a condition of society. I also seem to put more weight on my traditionally feminine hobbies when questioning my gender, where as I‚Äôm quick to push aside my traditionally masculine hobbies as not meaningful enough in this context. Again, illogical. 

I just feel like a being of nothingness. Just a being that doesn‚Äôt desire or align with the visual, physical world. However I don‚Äôt really present androgynously, because I don‚Äôt put weight into physical appearance determining gender and many of my interests fall into the cutesy/ pastel category. I would find it fine and not at all ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù of a man to participate in cutesy or pastel things, so I‚Äôm not sure why I feel so negatively towards myself about this stuff.

I guess I‚Äôll end this here because I‚Äôm genuinely just rambling.

tl;dr : 
Gender identity primarily feels spiritual with minimal genital dysphoria, ‚Äúgirly‚Äù interests make me doubt myself despite my ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù hobbies, gender neutral pronouns/chosen name make me feel best. I don‚Äôt feel ‚Äúnonbinary‚Äù enough I guess, or I feel as though it‚Äôs coming from an odd place.

2018-07-14 01:49:56,8yprgi,0,1,"I've been trying to understand gender and gender identity and how it relates to myself, but I'm struggling to figure things out, getting stressed and giving myself a headache. If I google definitions of 'gender identity', here are some of the things I get:

&gt; Identity: our deeply held, internal sense of self as male, female, a blend of both, or neither; who we internally know ourselves to be.   
&gt;  
&gt;\-  
&gt;  
&gt; Gender identity is defined as a personal conception of oneself as male or female (or rarely, both or neither). This concept is intimately related to the concept of gender role, which is defined as the outward manifestations of personality that reflect the gender identity. 

The issue I'm having is that with the ""personal conception of oneself as \[gender\]"", ""deeply held internal sense of self as \[gender\]"", ""innermost concept of self as \[gender\], I feel personally like I have no clue what that means or what they're talking about. If I say ""I'm male"", that feels like a statement of physical observation about by body. Like ""I'm 6'4"""", or ""I have blue eyes"". I'm really struggling to see how my male-ness is any more a part of my identity or sense of self than any other physical trait, I don't ""identify"" as a blue eyed person, or identify as a tall person, those are just physical observations, similarly ""identifying"" as a male just seems weird to me.

What I've read then gets into masculine vs. feminine behaviors or likes, but those just feel like boxes or stereotypes? I like 'feminine' things and 'masculine' things, I like doing both stereotypically 'masculine' and 'feminine' things, but as I said those just seem like pointless boxes. I've been told I 'socialize like a girl' and I have no clue what that means, but pretty much everyone sees me as male since I'm a tall viking looking person. I don't mind male pronouns, but people trying to apply hyper-masculine traits to me, or trying to shame me for doing 'feminine' things bothers the fuck out of me. My friends all use ""they"" to refer to me, so that's just what I'm used to in general, idk if I'm *more* comfortable with it. I'm physically female in a good portion of my dreams, sometimes feel weird about my male-bodied-ness, but the dreams have never seriously bothered me and the latter is pretty mild anymore. 

Am I just overthinking things? Like gender makes sense in my mind for other people. It makes sense in my mind for my trans friends, when I think about them it feels just obvious that they're the gender that they are and I've never struggled with that.

I like \'feminine\' things and \'masculine\' things, I like doing both stereotypically \'masculine\' and \'feminine\' things, but as I said those just seem like pointless boxes. I\'ve been told I \'socialize like a girl\' and I have no clue what that means, but pretty much everyone sees me as male since I\'m a tall viking looking person. I don\'t mind male pronouns, but people trying to apply hyper-masculine traits to me, or trying to shame me for doing \'feminine\' things bothers the fuck out of me. My friends all use ""they"" to refer to me, so that\'s just what I\'m used to in general, idk if I\'m *more* comfortable with it. I\'m physically female in a good portion of my dreams, sometimes feel weird about my male-bodied-ness, but the dreams have never seriously bothered me and the latter is pretty mild anymore. \n\nAm I just overthinking things? Like gender makes sense in my mind for other people. It makes sense in my mind for my trans friends, when I think about them it feels just obvious that they\'re the gender that they are and I\'ve never struggled with that. When I think about gender and myself though I just get mixed up and get a headache, and I feel like I have no idea what people are talking about with ""internal senses"" or ""personal conceptions"" of gender when it comes to me.

I'm developing a much clearer understanding of what I look like, noticing how things fit me more, what my head/hair shape actually looks like from all angles, how to take care of my curly hair better, etc. It all feels affirming, and my relationship to my body has only grown healthier.

Clothes though. Clothes are so hard for me. 

I've been trying out a lot of new kinds of clothes in recent months. New colors, textures, silhouettes.

2018-07-14 04:53:46,8yqujg,25,18,"Hi! I couldn't find an answer in the archives, so hoping I can find a few answers here.

I am a hetero, cis-woman that supports, but is not very familiar with individuals that identify as non-binary.

I'm creating a platonic friendship app and want to include settings that allow people to set preferences on who shows up in their feed based on their gender identity.

I.e. someone can select ""I am a woman"" and the option for ""I'd like to meet - Only Women"" would become available.

I am going to include non-binary as an option because I don;t want sign up to be a frustrating experience.

My questions are:

1. For ""I am a"" - should the option read ""non-binary individual"" or is there better, preferred phrasing I can use?
2. Would adding the option for ""I'd like to meet only NB individuals"" if someone selects ""I am a NB Individual"" be a setting people are looking for? 
3. Am I missing anything key? I want to create an experience that's welcoming and not restrictive for anybody, so if I'm making any mistakes, please let me know!

After I showed her that, she felt safe mentioning that she identifies as genderfluid, but she has parents who she knows wouldn‚Äôt accept her. She told me she doesn‚Äôt plan to come out to them until she‚Äôs out of college because then she can shut them out entirely from her life. She also mentioned her parents being very intent on making sure everything about her appearance was explicitly feminine. \n\nI can‚Äôt contact her now, but I may (hopefully) see her eventually. Is there any way I could have helped/could still help her? I feel really sorry that she‚Äôs stuck in this situation.

For the past few days I've followed the same pattern--I just wake up in the morning and look down at my body and go, okay.

I feel kinda like I wanna name my body, like you would affectionately nickname a car Ol' Bessie or something. It gets me where I need to go and it can't help being what it is.

It's this weird acceptance thing. And I keep wondering if now that I'm acknowledging that I am NB, have I opened a floodgate of some kind, and is body dysphoria suddenly going to kick in? Or more accurately, am I going to suddenly realize that I had body dysphoria all along? It's like what the what.

But anyway. Right now is okay. Right now, it feels like this weird amount of self-acceptance that I've never had before.

Hello all! I'm FtX, 22, NY based. 

I realized I wasn't cis a few years back. At that time, I thought I was gender fluid, and wanted to start T more than anything. Experienced dysphoria almost daily. Now I consider myself just genderless/something else, but I still think I want to start T. The problem is that before, I was with a partner who wouldn't have accepted it. Due to that, I just learned to ignore how I felt and buried it. A few years later, my now fiancee and I have talked it over and we agree that if I start it will be a process to get used to, but it's something we will work on together and he won't leave me because of it. He supports me 100%. 

Now, I'm just sort of feeling lost, because for the longest time I felt stuck with the way I am now. I'm very feminine looking, and I feared that my partners would leave if I looked more masculine. But now that it's a complete possiblity that I could start, I don't know what to really make of it.

What if I regret it? What if my fiancee starts to not be attracted to me because I look more masculine? 

With that being said, I am actually relatively comfortable with how I look. I want to lose some weight however, and I have heavy bouts of jealousy(?), envy(?) when I see other ""masculine"" looking people, ESPECIALLY andro people. I also feel that this apathy is just a result of my foolishness in putting someone elses desires before my own. Even if my fiancee isn't attracted to me if I start T, I could still make it on my own. He's been the only constant in my life, however, and losing his security would be devastating for a while. But I could make it. I love myself enough to do what I need to do to be happy, but I'm just worried about the potential fallout of starting To and finding out it isn't for me after all.

I dunno. I just feel sort of stuck. Thanks for reading this far is you have.

I like my birth name just fine, it's unique and doesn't cause me dysphoria, but I do dislike that it causes people to read me as (more) feminine. I usually go by my birth name in professional settings (which is fine for now, but if I end up finding a new job in a year or so I'm going to go by a chosen name instead). 

Socially and on social media I've been introducing myself as ""Cas"". It's a shortened version of my birth name and I like that it's gender-neutral. HOWEVER people have a really hard time with it for some reason. They can't figure out if I'm saying ""Cat"" or ""Gas"" or whatever and they always spell it with two S unless I correct them. 

My initials are CJ. I've been thinking about trying that as a name and might be able to ask a few close friends to do it. 

My question is...

If you were to hear the name ""Cas"" and the name ""CJ"", what gender would you assume someone is based on those names? Which do you think is easier to say/remember?

My smile's bright when I come out tonight

I am more than just my genes

An amazing evolution,

I don't care if some are mean!

There's a cool enby deep inside,

Couldn't keep it in, glad I didn't try (alternative, if you did suppress your identity: Heaven knows I've tried)

Don't let them in, don't let them see

Be the good girl you always have to be

Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know

Well, now they know!

I'm NB

I'm NB

Can't hold it in anymore

I'm NB

I'm NB

The world is an open door

I'm stronger than what they can say

I know I'm not wrong‚Äî

""They/them"" always suited me anyway!

/

Feels like my soul just got a rinse

I then ripped down a wall

And the fear (alt: and the girl) that once controlled me

Isn't in here at all!

/

It's time to see what I will do

Test the limits and break through!

No ""girl,"" no ""she,"" no dress for me!

I'm free!

/

I'm NB, I'm NB

To that scared girl, I say goodbye.

I'm NB, I'm NB

You'll sometimes see me cry,

Yet here I stand

And here I'll stay!

I know I'm not wrong‚Äî

""They/them"" always suited me anyway!

/

This here is my identity that I have found

My soul is now growing into myself all around!

I can completely understand myself, at last!

I'm never going back, the past is in the past!

/

I'm NB, I'm NB

And I'll rise like the break of dawn

I'm NB, I'm NB

That so-called girl is gone

Here I stand with ""her"" thrown away

I recently made the step from questioning to accepting that I am NonBinary. I haven't told many people and I haven't changes much of my presentation yet (have a lot to figure out).

As my assigned gender is still rather visible, I get misgendered quite recently. Unfortunately I can't even insist on using proper pronouns (they/them/their), because there aren't neutral options in my mother tongue. Due to this, I was just rolling with whatever pronouns were used.

My questions are, if you care/would care about pronouns in a similar situation?

I am AFAB, 49, bi-gender, and fully aware of it for only the last 19 months. However, according to everyone around me, my gender fluctuations (between binary masc and binary femme, nearly no middle ground, and the brief periods of time I am both I am at my most dysphoric) have been happening and obvious to anyone who knows me at all at least since I was a teenager in the 1980s. When I came out to two people I hadn't seen since about 1989, the response was ""yep, that makes sense."" My adult kids also said, ""Yeah, mom, we've always known you were more than *just* female.""

It was actually easier before I knew/understood what/who I am. I had mild dysphoria when I was on a guy swing, which has mostly disappeared since I now acknowledge my guy side, chosen a name, and present as male part time while on guy swings. But I was always very happy and comfortable on girl swings, though they weren't as *complete* as they are now.

There are times when I love being bi-gender, and I kind-of feel sorry for cisgender people who have never had the experience of *being* the other gender. I love *being* a guy, in a completely different way than the way I love being a girl. When I'm fully guy I'm totally relaxed, chill, comfortable, but at the same time thrilled and excited to be there. When I'm fully girl I feel powerful, intense, happy/bubbly and happy to be me.

However, now that I'm completely conscious of what's happening, I just want it to stop. I would prefer to be fully cis female. As a girl I'm totally femme, I feel like a cis girl, I am disinterested anything associated with guys, I don't even like unisex shirts. I won't ride a men's bike! I begin to doubt I have a masc side, and that it's all in my head. However, the next best thing would to be fully binary masc - just be completely FTM, and make a full transition to be happy. When I'm on a guy swing I start to doubt my femme identity, and I really feel fully male/transguy.

As it is I'm stuck going back and forth and it's getting really old, really fast. Sometimes it's worse than the dysphoria I had when I was an egg. When I didn't know what was happening I was like, okay, this is just the way I am, but I'm a girl, just a confused, weird girl. Now I am constantly dealing with my partial transition, maintaining two wardrobes, balancing two gender identities, and I'm getting to the point where I don't know who I am anymore, even at the same time I understand myself better than ever before.

I'm on T (13 months) and loving most of the changes - when I'm totally on a guy swing. My worst dysphoria is physical - presence of breasts (when I'm on a guy swing) and lack of a penis (all the time). This dysphoria has been there since I was 12, but I never knew *why* until recently. But I have to moderate the changes I allow myself. I have to maintain enough guy when I'm on a girl swing, so that when I swing back I don't get an attack of dysphoria, and the reverse, as a guy I have to maintain something of being a girl so that I don't freak out when I swing back to girl.

I would prefer to be fully cis female. As a girl I\'m totally femme, I feel like a cis girl, I am disinterested anything associated with guys, I don\'t even like unisex shirts. I won\'t ride a men\'s bike! I begin to doubt I have a masc side, and that it\'s all in my head. However, the next best thing would to be fully binary masc - just be completely FTM, and make a full transition to be happy. When I\'m on a guy swing I start to doubt my femme identity, and I really feel fully male/transguy.\n\nAs it is I\'m stuck going back and forth and it\'s getting really old, really fast. Sometimes it\'s worse than the dysphoria I had when I was an egg. When I didn\'t know what was happening I was like, okay, this is just the way I am, but I\'m a girl, just a confused, weird girl. Now I am constantly dealing with my partial transition, maintaining two wardrobes, balancing two gender identities, and I\'m getting to the point where I don\'t know who I am anymore, even at the same time I understand myself better than ever before.\n\nI\'m on T (13 months) and loving most of the changes - when I\'m totally on a guy swing. My worst dysphoria is physical - presence of breasts (when I\'m on a guy swing) and lack of a penis (all the time). This dysphoria has been there since I was 12, but I never knew *why* until recently. But I have to moderate the changes I allow myself. I have to maintain enough guy when I\'m on a girl swing, so that when I swing back I don\'t get an attack of dysphoria, and the reverse, as a guy I have to maintain something of being a girl so that I don\'t freak out when I swing back to girl.\n\nIf I could burn one of them out of me forever, I would do it in a heartbeat.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Question for those with fluctuating genders (genderfluid, bi-gender, tri-gender) - if you could, would you want to be single-gendered?', 'created': 1531875714.0}"

We spent the whole night going from crying and talking, with him saying some pretty upsetting things as he worked it out in his head, to not talking for hours so he could process/research and then he left to go drive and clear his head for like an hour, and he came back and was SO supportive and loving. I couldn't have asked for a better result, honestly. He's terrified this means I won't want to be with him, which is NOT the case. It's a gender identity thing, not a sexual orientation thing. He wants me to focus on figuring out what this means for me, and then we'll see what that means for our relationship. 

What's ultimately scary for both of us is if I come to the conclusion that I'm transmale (which I told him is a door I'm not closing as of yet), he might not be able to stay in a relationship with me if I go a certain way in terms of how I present (e.g. going on T or having top surgery). He's like a 0 on the Kinsey scale, so it'd be hard for him to maintain attraction to me if I looked too masc. Which I fully understand. I wouldn't force him to stay with me.

So, here's the sitch: my spouse (S) has terrible dysphoria around their chest. S has been wearing a binder for a couple of years now, and has wanted top surgery for even longer. The physical repercussions of wearing a binder, as well as the fact that their chest is very large (to the point where even if there wasn't chest-related dysphoria, S would probably need a reduction) are really taking a toll. BUT when it comes to taking concrete action towards getting the surgery (scheduling consultations, etc.) S seems to just freeze up. Their main reason is not wanting take time off work to see doctors (and also not wanting to explain what the surgery is to bosses). I think I might understand the delay better if I didn't see the constant physical and emotional pain this situation has caused them for the past several years.

I want S to be happy, and I know that top surgery will be a huge help. Right now I'm struggling with being supportive without feeling like I'm being paternalistic / doing the thing for them.

When I was younger, even though my mum cut my hair into a bob every time, I got taken for a boy by countless strangers. And it didn't perturb me - I actually enjoyed that fact. One of my early memories is of when my mum put my hair in plaits when it was wet (I think I was reluctant) so it would go wavy once dry. When I saw the result, I cried. It was horrible. I looked like a *girl.*

I remember looking in the mirror and holding my hair back, imagining myself as a boy. I thought I might make a good one. But how embarrassing would that be? It's impossible. And I'm so short.

Secondary school was a bit more difficult, due to the oft-cried phrase, ""is that a boy or a girl?""... well, obviously it was embarrassing. When people ask me, I don't know how to answer. Partly because it feels like a jibe, but partly because I don't want to answer. Often I say I'm ""whatever"". When people ask my pronouns, I'm just like..  ""use what you want dude"".

Even now I get taken for a boy. I'm not sure if this makes me uncomfortable solely because they must also assume I am 15 at most, or just because that's not how I identify, or just because I'm embarrassed for them! I know that I've internalised a lot of transphobia/homophobia from my dad, and that I don't want to come out as anything just because of what he might say, how he might taunt me, that kind of thing. I also know that I want to present sort of masculine, and have always resented the arse that my dad made clear that I had. (nothing sexual there, just inappropriate jokes/comments)

Mostly I just feel like a person, and definitely don't want to be taken for a girl. Being called ""girl"", ""lady"", any of that crap, makes my intestines tighten. Being looked upon by a male partner as a girl makes me uncomfortable. Thinking about it, this is probably why sex has been kind of a problem.

Recently I was thinking along the lines of ""right well though I feel sort of agender I'm going to keep my pronouns as she/her because otherwise I'm giving in to gender norms"".. but I'm starting to realise that part of gender identity is to do with how you want people to treat you. I'm starting to realise what social dysphoria actually is, and that it exists, and that I have it. I always thought the only dysphoria was physical dysporia and being misgendered. And also, I may have physical dysphoria. I'm never sure what to think of my breasts. Fortunatlely they're small. I never wear dresses or skirts - because I hate how they make me feel.

2018-07-20 20:15:44,90jdfr,11,8,"Hey fellow EnBy's!!!
I am wondering if anyone has gotten married and if you have any tips and such for a non-binary wedding!!

My partner is AFAB and MostlyCis. I am AFAB Agender/NB.

My party will pretty much be a mix of genders and presentations. However hers will likely be all ciswomen. I have very strong feelings about not forcing anyone to dress a certain way and I feel having her party all in the same outfit is going to be really odd. any thoughts on that?

On a second note I do not think I will have a Best Person. I will simply be referring to my whole party as my Best People. Does anyone have experience in this aspect? I am looking for ways to explain this when I do ask my people to stand but cant seem to find anything to help navigate this kind of thing.

I'm 25, AMAB. I came out as gay about 5 years ago. For the longest time I have felt like I'm not a man. I never experienced dysphoria, but mentally, I have always felt in between. For instance, growing up I got in better with girls in many ways, I've always loved the subtle beauty of light make up, and the look of a loose fitting blouse. I crave the femininity of  those pretty girls that have long flowing hair, and flowing dresses. On the flip side, I look very masculine. I have a thick beard, lots of body hair, and broad shoulders. 

Now for my question. I'm happy with my body. There are some things that I would change but nothing drastic. I hate how I look without facial hair, whether that's a beard or a mustache. I feel confident when I look masculine. The thing is though, when I put on make up (red lipstick is my weakness) and wear feminine clothing I feel confident too.

2018-07-21 23:51:57,90tnwq,1,10,"Pluralgender is a term that (I assume) I coined a long time ago when I felt the need to and is a term I came to identify myself with. It's kinda sorta similar to genderfluid.

I actually coined it around the time I made [this old post](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/5xkb9y/neurogenders_and_internalized_ableism_read_this/) (and I think I posted it elsewhere first, so it's likely older than reddit says it is!), and indeed it is a kind of neurogender. It has to do with plurality and I feel like [these resources](http://areweplural.com/) would be better at explaining it because plurality is different for everyone.

For me, I am mostly median (see resources above), and different Is have different genders.

so uh, like, I consider myself pluralgender in terms of identity/brain sex/etc, but right now I am a woman in terms of gender. so that also means I'm currently going by she/her pronouns. however, if I switch to someone who isn't a woman, I'll probably want a different set of pronouns.

some ppl think sex and gender are the same, and that's fine - on an *individual* level. if you look at the full picture, you'll just... notice you're actually excluding genderfluid and pluralgender ppl... well I mean hopefully you'd notice.

I don't believe gender and sex are really the same, because of this. because I feel like it excludes/invalidates me.

Maybe just ask for a higher dose of estrogen patches?

2018-07-22 23:35:59,9124zz,15,16,"Hi all,

I'm I another phase of doubt again. I stopped questioning not long ago in favor of being non binary. Now I'm back to doubting and feeling fake.

My experience after learning about non binary identities around 1.5 years ago, resulted in an extended period of questioning my gender identity (AMAB). First I thought I was a Trans woman, but this doesn't fit my experience either, as I feel good or indifferent about my body. Sometimes I wished I had a female body, but not as often as I'd expect Trans women to wish and I don't feel like I would change my manners and thinking much. In retrospect I realized that I always was fascinated at the idea of shape-shifting/temporal gender swapping and that I'd consider that the perfect solution for me.

As I don't see a clear transition goal (at least medically), I don't think that I will do anything medically soon.

My questions are:

How do you feel valid?

Is my experience valid?

How do you distinguish between gender non conformity (not really sticking to gender roles and all that stuff) and being non binary?

How do you know that it's the right thing and not just an excuse for something else(issues with self worth, being bad at performing as male ) /wanting to be part of a group?

I guess this post somewhat degenerated into a rant, but it's an emotional topic for me. Therefore I thank everyone who read this post completely.

I don't feel comfortable writing a lot of female viewpoint characters, and when I do, they turn out stilted to me.

guys. it‚Äôs so frustrating. 
my dad is suportive of my being trans on the surface. uses my name and pronouns. but as soon as i express the desire to do anything physical he tries his darndest to dissuade me and poke holes in my reasoning. last year i started t behind his back after trying for weeks to explain to him why i needed to. i didnt Need his approval to start i just wanted him to be in my corner so bad. he was going to try and make me go to multiple doctors for 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th opinions and didnt understand the redundancy when i already had a therapist and various heathcare providers. he just wanted me to keep asking until someone told me HE was right, even though he‚Äôd never admit that. he compared hrt to cancer in that it would be insane of me to do any treatment without top specialists signing off on it.

now since then i‚Äôve expressed to him how much happier i am with hrt and he seems to believe me and does support me but now that i‚Äôm getting top surgery consultations its back to square one. he is absolutely infuriating me because even after the 7 years ive been out to him he keeps going in circles around the ‚Äúhow do you KNOW‚Äù and ‚Äúbut you don‚Äôt SEEM masculine to ME‚Äù questions that ive explained carefully and as effectively as i can manage 100s of times. 
he told me he hopes i decide not to do it, and that it‚Äôs keeping him up at night. 

that just hurt. he hopes i decide not to do something that has the potential to bring me so much happiness and i just can‚Äôt make him understand why its important to me. he is losing sleep in anxiety over something i see as a future of freedom and (overused joke) a weight of my chest. 

i need his financial support in order to go through with top surgery within the next couple years because i am a full time student and really can‚Äôt handle more than an occassional couple shifts at my min wage job. im going to have him visit my therapist to talk but he‚Äôs so stubborn i dont know if it will help.

2018-07-28 02:17:52,92imwb,6,8,"Hey everyone! 
I've been thinking of posting something like this on various social media/support groups but I'm worried about how it will be received. You all seem lovely in the responses I have read from the archived posts, so thanks in advance for any and all responses!

I read another post about a month ago regarding this topic (forestmango 's post) but it didn't answer all of my questions so I hope it's okay if I post this here?

I'm a cis(?) woman currently questioning my gender.

It has a lot to do with not understanding/feeling alienated from womanhood/femininity in one breath (and being okay with that, having the freedom of being andro-presenting, rejected girly things/never liked them in the first place) but also I feel ashamed because I am not ""feminine enough"" for my current gender.

Being currently identified as an adult woman, I feel constantly pressured to present fem all the time and to conform to the gender binary. I never did when I was a kid- but it's nice to look nice and get complimented for your efforts. (It takes so much energy out of me to present fem when I'm not feeling fem) But I'm not sure if that's because they think I look nice, or they like the fact that I'm presenting ""correctly"" to my assigned gender.

I have no idea what it means to be a woman (take away the female biology) truly but I really want to know. It's so hard for me to grasp. I feel like Ariel wanting to be a part of the 'pretty fem world' but never feeling welcome unless I bring the correct dress code and even then- I still feel left of center in women's spaces. It's a weird disconnect/connect situation that I haven't quite figured out yet. 

(I was thinking of opening a conversation with some of my trans-fem friends and ask how they would describe womanhood and how they feel it, but I'm not sure if that's a shitty question that I shouldn't ask.)

Some days I can really feel the fem energy very strongly but most days I just feel like a person and I want to be treated as such. I've come to terms with I might be genderqueer/genderfluid moreso than non-binary or cis but I don't want to take away from people who are really aligned with those labels. 

Whenever I look at my own face and it doesn't align with what I have in my head I can't recognize myself and I feel so sad that I can't just be the way I want to look, or accept myself as is.

I also feel a strong desire to express my truth (through music, I'm a musician in a lot of women//trans//GNC empowered spaces) -that you don't have to be feminine/fem presenting to be a valid woman. But how can I do that if I don't even believe it in myself? I want to be confident that you can be andro/masc + a woman, or feminine and Non-Binary but I haven't accepted myself as either of those when I know I should.

I don't want to invade any spaces or take any resources I'm just really lost and uncomfortable in my own skin.

I can't tell if I'm having trouble being myself (A GNC fem/andro cis woman) and accepting that that is okay!
OR
Actually a Non-binary person who feels different energies and has/wants a strong connection to womanhood and the women around me.

I'm so sorry if this came off as very rambly. My non-binary friend that I spoke to last year (amab) said that the feelings I have would still make me cis and I believe them to a degree but I still feel as if something is off.

I've been trying out She/her and they/them pronouns recently and it feels really nice! Rebecca Sugar one of my favorite creators just came out as a Non-Binary woman and that made me feel really at ease to know someone else might get it! But if I'm not Non-Binary, I don't want to incorrectly use the label.

Thanks again for reading this whole dang thing, I've been feeling very restless about this for so long. Part of me knows you can be an andro woman and be valid, but that doesn't feel quite right. Everything that comes with womanhood and femininity sucks in this world because it's perceived as ""lesser"" so that might add to it? Maybe some internalized misogyny in there? If anyone can relate or offer some advice, I'm open to any and all comments even if they are negative. Thanks again &lt;3

You all seem lovely in the responses I have read from the archived posts, so thanks in advance for any and all responses!\n\nI read another post about a month ago regarding this topic (forestmango \'s post) but it didn\'t answer all of my questions so I hope it\'s okay if I post this here?\n\nI\'m a cis(?) woman currently questioning my gender.\n\nIt has a lot to do with not understanding/feeling alienated from womanhood/femininity in one breath (and being okay with that, having the freedom of being andro-presenting, rejected girly things/never liked them in the first place) but also I feel ashamed because I am not ""feminine enough"" for my current gender.\n\nBeing currently identified as an adult woman, I feel constantly pressured to present fem all the time and to conform to the gender binary. I never did when I was a kid- but it\'s nice to look nice and get complimented for your efforts. (It takes so much energy out of me to present fem when I\'m not feeling fem) But I\'m not sure if that\'s because they think I look nice, or they like the fact that I\'m presenting ""correctly"" to my assigned gender.\n\nI have no idea what it means to be a woman (take away the female biology) truly but I really want to know. It\'s so hard for me to grasp. I feel like Ariel wanting to be a part of the \'pretty fem world\' but never feeling welcome unless I bring the correct dress code and even then- I still feel left of center in women\'s spaces. It\'s a weird disconnect/connect situation that I haven\'t quite figured out yet. \n\n(I was thinking of opening a conversation with some of my trans-fem friends and ask how they would describe womanhood and how they feel it, but I\'m not sure if that\'s a shitty question that I shouldn\'t ask.)\n\nSome days I can really feel the fem energy very strongly but most days I just feel like a person and I want to be treated as such. I\'ve come to terms with I might be genderqueer/genderfluid moreso than non-binary or cis but I don\'t want to take away from people who are really aligned with those labels. \n\nWhenever I look at my own face and it doesn\'t align with what I have in my head I can\'t recognize myself and I feel so sad that I can\'t just be the way I want to look, or accept myself as is.\n\nI also feel a strong desire to express my truth (through music, I\'m a musician in a lot of women//trans//GNC empowered spaces) -that you don\'t have to be feminine/fem presenting to be a valid woman. But how can I do that if I don\'t even believe it in myself? I want to be confident that you can be andro/masc + a woman, or feminine and Non-Binary but I haven\'t accepted myself as either of those when I know I should.\n\nI don\'t want to invade any spaces or take any resources I\'m just really lost and uncomfortable in my own skin.\n\nI can\'t tell if I\'m having trouble being myself (A GNC fem/andro cis woman) and accepting that that is okay!\nOR\nActually a Non-binary person who feels different energies and has/wants a strong connection to womanhood and the women around me.\n\nI\'m so sorry if this came off as very rambly. My non-binary friend that I spoke to last year (amab) said that the feelings I have would still make me cis and I believe them to a degree but I still feel as if something is off.\n\nI\'ve been trying out She/her and they/them pronouns recently and it feels really nice! Rebecca Sugar one of my favorite creators just came out as a Non-Binary woman and that made me feel really at ease to know someone else might get it! But if I\'m not Non-Binary, I don\'t want to incorrectly use the label.\n\nThanks again for reading this whole dang thing, I\'ve been feeling very restless about this for so long. Part of me knows you can be an andro woman and be valid, but that doesn\'t feel quite right. Everything that comes with womanhood and femininity sucks in this world because it\'s perceived as ""lesser"" so that might add to it? Maybe some internalized misogyny in there? If anyone can relate or offer some advice, I\'m open to any and all comments even if they are negative. Thanks again &lt;3\n\n\nTLDR: I (Cis? woman) am questioning my gender.

TBH, most people would have no idea that I feel like an enby because I live with such enormous pressure to conform.  My wife and I have come to an agreement that ""boundaries"" shall consist of me dressing and presenting masculinely when we go out together, but I can do as I please around the house.  (She says she is afraid that someone might do something to us.)

So... around the house, I wear a dress from time to time, and at first, it's like, ""Oh cool!  I can wear different clothes and see how they feel"", but after a bit, it's like, ""Okay, I'm wearing a dress.  Whatever...""

Trying to learn to express myself as an enby means far more to me than just wearing a dress or changing my hairstyle.

**The first time I felt a trifle of gender euphoria about not being cismale** was when my wife used to tease me by playfully insinuating that I am gay.  (I am strictly gynoromantic.)  Whenever she did this, I would smile and put on some excessively feminine body language and saying something like ""Oh really, Dear?  You think that I am gay?  I want to hear all about it, Sweetheart!"" and we would both laugh, and **I really enjoyed it**.

When I actually have a serious conversation and came out as trans-enby, this fun came to a screeching halt.  She is afraid of her husband becoming something she is no longer attracted to, and she won't even play about it anymore.

So, to me, being non-binary means exactly what the word means: ""not one or the other"".  So, I've been wondering if anyone here has had any success with presenting gender-fluid, gender-queer, androgynous, or agender behaviors and mannerism.

If so, what did it feel like?  How to people respond?

I'm a somewhat closeted transmasculine non binary person. I currently live in Asia for work and present as my cis gender to make life easier for myself socially essentially. Unfortunately I plan on living in Asia for about seven more years into the future to achieve some personal life goals of mine before returning to the states where I can probably transition medically via HRT to reach a more androgynous place in presentation and potentially in mindset as well. Anyway, I would describe myself as an effeminate (trans)man. I find androgyny to be the ultimate beauty ideal and find myself drawn to androgynous people. I feel like carving a life out in society as a non binary person though can be quite difficult and confusing at times. If someone is sure of their gender, that is if they identify as a binary gender such as male or female, that will reflect in their official documents, etc, but for those of us who don't identify as a binary gender neither of them feel completely right. This is the case for me anyway. I can manage living with the gender I was assigned at birth because I enjoy effeminate things. The rest I'll have to live with and stave off dysphoria with positivity and hope for the future. As much as I want to become androgynous at times there are moments for example when I'm wearing a skirt presenting as female (as usual) and I think about the future, and transitioning and if I appear male to people having to present as male to be socially accepted and that meaning I'd likely have to wear pants or shorts and then feeling a kind of sadness over the loss of being able to openly wear skirts without fear if I have more of a masculine form. I feel like approaching androgyny from the binary female side seems easier than the binary masculine side, in that femininity has more flexibility and freedom than masculinity, at least in American society. In Asia, ironically, in comparison to America, it seems more fluid and free. Men where I live would likely be considered metrosexual in America. Anyway, back to the point. Neither male or female feels right on official documents, so which do I chose? That's difficult. Dating as a non binary person or trans person seems relatively difficult as well and is honestly another part of the reason I suppress my trans identity at times, because navigating the dating world as a cis person (correct term?) is so much easier and the dating pool seems so much larger. That's such a discouraging thing about being trans, the inevitable rejection due to your plumbing situation, which as a transman you have little control over because none of the options, at least to me, end in satisfying results. Anyway (sorry I'm all over the place I have ADHD) I also think about getting married and having kids some day. I worry about raising kids as a non binary or trans person, though our generation seems more open to such things. I also have no idea what I would wear at my wedding. A dress? A suit? And then when it comes to kids I know I'd want to get pregnant and give birth to them myself, so if I do hormones I have to consider the effects of them on my body and have to go off of them in order to have kids.

I call myself a non-binary trans girl, for convenience's sake and a way of saying ‚Äúnot binary, not a guy‚Äù. But I don't know if that label really fits me. What‚Äôs actually happening is that I‚Äôm in flux between ""girl"" and ""none pizza"", with a lack of gender winning out most of the time.

I feel like I'm dealing with some DFAB trans issues in a DMAB body, and it confuses the hell out of me. I know agender DMAB folks are out there, and I know the term demigirl exists for those of us who still feel a connection to the ‚Äúgirl‚Äù category, but I still feel like a fake in most trans and even non-binary spaces.

But then I look at transfeminine spaces, and a lot of the things they list as positives ‚Äî yay boobs! yay skirts! ‚Äî don‚Äôt read as positive at all to me. I feel stuck because I can‚Äôt perform gender in a way that both feels good to me and is understood by others.

I'm slightly romantically and sexually interested in women, but I don't really consider myself a lesbian, or straight for that matter. Just a person who might maybe have a partner someday, but honestly isn't in a rush to start anything.

2018-07-30 22:11:05,938lax,2,2,"Hi everyone,

I'm new to this sub, and this explanation is going to be jumbled and messy, so buckle in. Apologies in advance if none of this makes sense. :/ 

So I've pretty much lived my whole life identifying as female; when I was a kid, though, I would idolize male characters in tv shows and movies. I proudly called myself a tomboy and vehemently rejected anything I deemed ""girly,"" sometimes even wishing I'd been born a boy. Most of the time, though, I didn't dislike that I was a girl, but it was more of the restrictions placed on me and what was expected from me. I didn't really feel like a girl, but I didn't really feel like a boy. As I grew up and became a teenager, I'd watch the way male characters in films would react to situations, even mundane mannerisms like body language and facial expressions; I almost always could only relate to male characters. But like I said before, I was always aware of gender roles (even if I didn't have the terms to articulate it then), so I'd watch these male characters and think, ""Why can't girls/women act like that?"" or ""Why can't I be like that?""

By college, I started learning more about gender studies and lgbtqa issues, and I chalked up my childhood feelings as being internalized misogyny--it's not that I wanted to be a male as a kid, I just idolized what those characters represented to me. That said, I've been thinking more and more about how I actually feel in regards to my own gender and identity. And I'm thoroughly confused (such a plot twist, I know). So overall, I feel like I mainly (maybe 55% of the time) identify as female, I think? I'll get more into that--but the other remaining time, I don't really identify as anything. I know for sure I don't want to be seen as male, so I suppose I'd label that other \~half as agender. I don't experience dysphoria, but I also don't really see my body and think, ""Yup, I feel feminine."" It's just kind of there, and I've lived my whole life in my body, so I'm fine with it. But I guess I'm trying to figure out, if I feel like I identify as female \~half the time, what does that even mean?

\-Besides concealer, I don't wear makeup anymore except for special occasions--same goes for things like dresses. I dress pretty casually and androgynously. But the thing is, that's gender expression. Makeup isn't inherently female; short hair isn't inherently male; etc. etc. you guys already know this.

\-Do I feel like I'm female because I act in certain ways? Do I feel like part of me is agender because some of my actions don't feel female? But obviously actions themselves aren't inherently female or male either; like I mentioned earlier, it's about how gender roles are presented in media and how we're conditioned to adhere to the binary, right?

\-And it can't be related to how I feel about my body because I know that body parts aren't inherently gendered. 

I don't know if any of this makes sense. I just feel like I'm trying to figure out a way to make sense and order of my feelings and perceptions but with hazy definitions based around abstract concepts. I know I can identify (or not identify) any way that I feel is comfortable to me, but I can't even make sense of what exactly I feel to begin with. :/ ",NonBinary,Figuring things out with definitions that make no sense to me,1533013865.0,"{'created_utc': 1532988665, 'id': '938lax', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 2, 'selftext': 'Hi everyone,\n\nI\'m new to this sub, and this explanation is going to be jumbled and messy, so buckle in. Apologies in advance if none of this makes sense. :/ \n\nSo I\'ve pretty much lived my whole life identifying as female; when I was a kid, though, I would idolize male characters in tv shows and movies. I proudly called myself a tomboy and vehemently rejected anything I deemed ""girly,"" sometimes even wishing I\'d been born a boy. Most of the time, though, I didn\'t dislike that I was a girl, but it was more of the restrictions placed on me and what was expected from me. I didn\'t really feel like a girl, but I didn\'t really feel like a boy. As I grew up and became a teenager, I\'d watch the way male characters in films would react to situations, even mundane mannerisms like body language and facial expressions; I almost always could only relate to male characters. But like I said before, I was always aware of gender roles (even if I didn\'t have the terms to articulate it then), so I\'d watch these male characters and think, ""Why can\'t girls/women act like that?"" or ""Why can\'t I be like that?""\n\nBy college, I started learning more about gender studies and lgbtqa issues, and I chalked up my childhood feelings as being internalized misogyny--it\'s not that I wanted to be a male as a kid, I just idolized what those characters represented to me. That said, I\'ve been thinking more and more about how I actually feel in regards to my own gender and identity. And I\'m thoroughly confused (such a plot twist, I know).

I am AMAB non-binary and trying to learn more about T. My levels are low for an AMAB person not currently undergoing any hormone treatments - 236. Hormone specialist said, based on that and my naturally elevated E (in 60s), that she would have expected someone who is AMAB with my hormone levels to experience gender dysphoria. I am not sure what that means, since my understanding is that hormones do not directly influence gender identity. 

My question in general is what T levels, pre any HRT, look like for AMAB people. Do AMAB people experiencing gender dysphoria have levels of T that vary in any consistent way from cis AMAB people? My gut intuition would be no, but I am curious. Also I am trying to figure out why my own hormones are so off from a typical cis AMAB person. Does what I am describing resonate with anyone here?
