My friend told me last night about an app he learned about at a game developing convention last year. It's called A Normal Lost Phone. He raved about how after he and his friends finished play-testing it, they were awestruck at how heavy it hit and it was all they could talk about the rest of the day.

The basic concept is the app creates an interface of a fictional person's cellphone that you have found. To play, you have to go through the phone to figure out how to get it back to the owner.

I just finished playing through it on a flight (took me about 2 hours) and it was SO amazing it made me cry. 

I'm hoping we can spread more word of this game, because it could really make such an amazing difference as a tool for education in people's lives.

It's $3, but I swear it is well worth it. If you play it, make sure you pour over every detail.

**I have received approval from mods to post this.‚Äã**

‚Äã

Hello!

For my university degree project at SAE Institute Glasgow I am creating an album expressing: people's experience being Queer; Queer theory; and my Queer experience.

Everyone's experience is extremely unique yet I want to see what themes arise across a variety of people outside of the cis/hetero-normative idenities.

I have created a survey (linked below) and it would be extremely helpful if you could spare some time to answer what you can! All questions are optional and you can answer as much as your comfortable with, however the more detail of thoughts and feelings the better!

‚Äã

I have a great response from the asexual community so far and I feel it's equally important to get the perspectives of those outside the gender binary as both are often misunderstood and overlooked. Additionally, as I'm having some gender trouble myself hearing your experiences would be personally beneficial haha!

‚Äã

If you have any questions let me know below!

Also, my university email is [94282uk@saeinstitute.edu](mailto:94282uk@saeinstitute.edu) if anyone has further enquiries.

Thank you!

Robert

I start work on Monday. I want to introduce myself as a nonbinary person and tell people that I use 'they' pronouns to refer to myself, and would like it if they did so as well. I want to do this right off the bat, so I won't have to ask people to change pronouns weeks or months into my job - that would be more confusing and difficult for everyone. I work at a growing company (500+ people), so there's also no way I will meet every person I will interact with on day one, so I may have to be introducing myself this way for a while.

This will be a first for me, I've always used the pronouns that I was ""born with"". I have been trying out dressing androgynous and genderfluid, and disregarding gender expectations with my actions and mannerisms, and both make me feel more like myself and make it easier to love myself! I have told my friends I am nonbinary, and my partner (who is super awesome and supportive!) but this will be my first time asking anyone other than my partner to use nonbinary pronouns to talk about me.

I'm really nervous that I'll scare people away and that I won't make any friends, and I'm a people person/extrovert and REALLY want to make friends in my new town.

I figured it was just my dysphoric brain screwing with me, and that things would be better after I started HRT. And, I was half right, actually. Going on HRT cleared my mind and made me feel like *me* for the first time since when I was a little kid.

But that weird nagging feeling remained. It was like there was this barrier between me and transgender women. Like, a lot of their experiences about discovering their femininity didn't resonate with me. I like presenting as androgynous, there are some stereotypically male things I like, and I never really felt comfortable considering myself as a ""woman"". 

I thought that it might be I'm just butch, or that I've got some form of internalized transphobia to overcome, but neither of those felt right. The more I thought about it, the more I realized I just want to be a cute, slightly androgynous soft-butch tomboy and not have to act womanly or be male.

I talked a bit with some NB people I knew, and I felt that sense of connection that I was failing to get with binary trans women (or with cis-men) and I kind of realized that...hey, maybe this works for me as well?

So I guess I'm some sort of mess of a transfemme non-binary demigirl wibbly wobbly...thingy. Though, I don't really care about the label so much as the fact that I realized I can be feminine without being female, and it's liberating. It's the same euphoria that I had when I realized I wasn't male.

2018-10-08 00:31:34,9ma8g4,2,1,"Hey all!       

I've been thinking about going on E for some time, but I have reservations, and I think talking it out and listening to the experience of other people would help me.         

Some things about me:
I'm 20, AMAB, use she/her or they/them, and am autistic and hella queer.       

Positive thoughts about HRT:
I'm pretty sure I'd love having boobs, as well as basically all of the other physical changes that hormones being about.

I am additionally very uncomfortable as being read as cis male.



Negative thoughts:

I'm somewhat scared of having things that happen while on e to make me dysphoric in the other direction. I, for instance, could imagine overly large beast development making me feel bad as well.           


I don't want to go sterile. I'm not sure that I want kids in the future, but I might. I am also autistic, and have this somewhat nonsensical fear/anxiety that I would be unable to communicate with/relate to children that I may raise (especially if they are not biologically related to me and are not as likely to communicate as I do). 
             
I like being able to get erections, and to penetrate, and would not want that to stop.     
      
I'm just starting to understand how to live with some somewhat serious mental illness, and I'm worried that going through puberty again could be damaging to my mental health.

I'm currently not out to my parents, and although I think everything would be fine, they make me uncomfortable, and used to be emotionally abusive, and I'd rather just not deal with them.          

Additionally, it's scary to think of no longer being able to pass as cis. Being trans around people is scary, and sometimes more than I can deal with (hell, being around people is sometimes more than I can deal with).
       


I think my big problem is that there are not very many research/statistics, and it is incredibly hard to make an informed decision/calculated risk when information doesn't exist.

Sometimes I wonder if it would be easier to be FTM as that is something more people understand. Saying I don't want to be a woman but also not a man seems to confuse the hell out of people.

Nobody cares and it‚Äôs what I‚Äôm most comfortable in. \n\nHowever, I don‚Äôt identify with any gender, but none of the labels or categories feel right to me either. Non-binary isn‚Äôt right, nor is agender, grey-gender, demi-girl, nothing. None of it is right for me. \n\nThis has caused a great deal of anxiety and confusion for me and I‚Äôm determined to make it stop and figure out what‚Äôs going on. \n\nI hope I can stay on this sub and keep making jokes about how there‚Äôs an unwritten law that everyone has to be beautiful here (there isn‚Äôt, by the way, it was just me being silly) and leave positive, genuine comments on photos and be part of this community. \n\nSo many of you have uplifted me and helped me and validated me and I‚Äôm truly grateful. If I can‚Äôt stay on this sub, then this is my swan song. \n\nThank you to all of you truly beautiful humans. You may only appear as text on a screen to me, but some of your comments have genuinely brightened my day, so thank you so much...\n\n\n', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'I‚Äôm not non-binary...', 'created': 1539486814.0}"

So, a few months ago, I stared questioning my gender. I‚Äôm just gonna list some facts about my gender expression and such.

- I chopped off a foot of hair and basically got a buzzcut.
- I feel uncomfortable with my chest (I have larger breasts) and wear baggy clothes, usually sweatshirts, to hide my chest.
- If I ever muster the courage to come out, I‚Äôd get a binder. And top surgery is something I‚Äôd be interested in.
- I‚Äôm perfectly fine with she/her, they/them, and only like to be called he/him when strangers misgender (?) me.
- I don‚Äôt shave my legs unless forced by outside forces.
- I feel unconnected from gender in general, I guess. 


I think why I‚Äôm doubting myself so much is because of my family. They dislike my haircuts, (‚ÄúNo, no. Don‚Äôt cut it!‚Äù).

When I had my surgery even my female side didn't miss my breasts, which were a deflated, floppy DD after massive weight loss. My girl side did want to wear bras though, to make me feel femme when I needed it.  
I'm beginning to suspect I have two things going on -- a previously diagnosed condition called macromastia (diagnosed when I was in my 20s and went from a DDD to an II in only a few months) and possible androgen insensitivity syndrome.   
At about 5-6 weeks post-surgery the swelling went down, and my chest was quite flat, a nice masculine shape. Then in the next week or so I noticed a change in the shape, evenly on both sides, I figured it was just my body working things out, but it kept changing, fast! The upper area, where I am pretty sure the doctor left some breast tissue for shaping, began to grow and become more cone-like. The new cone shape is also starting to expand below the incision lines/bottom of pects, toward my old inframammary line. They seem to be well on their way to filling the soft B cup bras I purchased after surgery, with intent to fill them using breast forms.   
In the last week I gained enough mass that now I can create a decent cleavage. I couldn't do that before, not even close. Now my chest skin is starting to feel uncomfortably stretched, the skin is definitely being expanded by this growth.  
Regarding the suspected testosterone insensitivity, I started T in June 2016, and immediately had a lot of good changes, including bottom growth, and increased hair growth and muscle tone, but my speaking voice never changed (though it wrecked my singing voice, which wasn't all that good anyway) and I never had acne (not complaining!) nor facial changes.   
For two months in late 2016 I quit T because my female side decided to take over, and it just felt wrong, I panicked. I started again because I was suffering without it. But when I restarted, the changes didn't return. Bottom growth did not continue, and even the hair growth didn't return, except for what remained from the first round of T. I had to quit T for a while for top-surgery, and I've been back on it for more than a month now, and I'm not feeling any of the relief effects of T that I initially had.

I've (AMAB 25) been unsure about my sexuality and gender identity since grade school  (played with my sister's toys as a kid because they had cool mechanics and was always frustrated that certain things that I thought were cool were pigeonholed as ""girly""). I only really came to terms with my pansexuality a few years ago while dating a trans girl who, for the first few dates until she came out to me, passed very convincingly. It was then that I realized I didn't give two shits what someone identifies as or what parts they've got, as long as they're a good person.

When I started dating my current GF, I was relieved to find out she was pan as well so no friction there! She began to express an interest in me crossdessing for her in bed sometimes, and I not-so-reluctantly agreed. I started to realize that - hey - I actually just plain enjoy *feeling* more femme once in a while, beyond just the sexual gratification for her and I. I had talked to her about these feelings almost a year ago and she was very accepting of it, but I had stressed that I was still confused about it. Fast forward to a couple months ago: I made a conscious decision to begin growing my hair out with the goal being shoulder length or just past, I began stealing my girlfriend's more andro clothing pieces like cardigans, sweatpants and jackets, but doing all of this without really acknowledging why it made me feel so cozy on the inside.

A few weeks ago, I stumbled blindly into r/traaa from an askreddit thread and was curious about whether I was an ""egg"" or not. Found my way to egg_irl and while there would be a point here or there I would agree with for me, I didn't really feel ""called out"" by it like some do. Since then I did some serious thinking about my body and what these feelings mean to me and have come to the conclusion that I don't hate, nor do I love all my body's features. I realized that I've been frustrated with my giant Adam's apple for well over a decade, that I wish my hips were wider and my butt was bigger, that maybe having small breasts could be nice. BUT I also realized that i really appreciate my ability to grow an ok beard (babyfaced af until 22), I love my voice (deep and resonating, but still having big falsetto range for singing), and I realized that I cherish and love my penis to no end. Real sure of that one because if I take a break from my ADHD meds and go back on them I can't get a boner for like 2 or 3 days and it's SO FRUSTRATING.

So for a while I was confused because I genuinely feel a certain new happiness that I haven't felt before when I feel femme, but there is no dysphoria about feeling masc. So today I decided to say ""Fuck all this confusion, I'm gonna accept my feelings for how they are and express myself more fluidly"" And layed down with my girlfriend to tell her. She had some questions but it was all in the pursuit of greater understanding and she didn't even hesitate with accepting it (she's a social work student so she's brimming with compassion) and when we were done I cried a little and thanked her. I realized how good it felt to finally be able to say these things with confidence so I wanted to come share good feels with y'all.

More detailed story/rant below.  I'm mainly looking for ""what questions should I be asking myself?"" sort of advice since I know no one can just give me an answer.

Long Rambling Story:
I've never really liked dresses/skirts and always prefered jeans/t-shirts/polos and other gender neutral clothing, but always considered that more of a presentation/look thing than anything to do with my identity.  For my hair I grew it out so I'd look less like a guy but hated it down so I kept it up in a ponytail except to shower/sleep.

A couple months ago I decided to try a bob cut because as I said I hated it long but I ended up feeling hugely dysphoric (like last male haircut I ever had dysphoric) but it was because it was way too feminine... not too masculine... and now I don't know what to think.  This is the first time I've ever felt flat out dysphoric because of looking too much like a girl... or maybe hating my long hair was the same and I just didn't realize it for what it was?

Now I'm re-evaluating everything, everything I've done for transitioning has been ""okay it doesn't make me look like a guy, good enough"".  Voice, got it to the point where I stopped being called sir on the phone, good enough.  Keep working till I get ma'am-ed on the phone? Too much work.  Face?  I have pretty androgynous features, I can get gendered female without makeup/FFS, so I wont bother.  Breasts? I've got them, they're small but surgery seems like a lot of work for something cosmetic.  I thought I was just lazy/not as dedicated to passing as some but between that and the dysphoria now I'm wondering if I never felt like trying because I didn't want it.

All that has me wondering if I'm nonbinary.  But at the same time I had huge genital dysphoria and got bottom surgery and I've never had second thoughts about that.  I'm getting to the point where other than a couple of masculine features I'm working on I can look at myself naked in the mirror and see a woman... and that doesn't bother me, but at the same time hormones haven't erased my semi-masculine skeletal structure... so...

2018-10-19 05:53:10,9ph178,1,1,"TL;DR  I know I want to be as flat as possible with my shirt on, but no idea what I want to look like with my shirt off. 

So recently I talked to a surgeon about top. I'm pretty set on not wanting D.I. I don't want my nipples to be free grafted.

 I thought that meant my only option was t anchor, like a traditional reduction, but when I went to my consult my surgeon threw me off with mentioning buttonhole. I heard of it, but since this was an insurance provided surgeon I didn't think she'd be willing to do it. I knew she did D.I, Peri, and keyhole, along with breast reductions for cis women. I knew I wouldn't qualify for peri or keyhole, and intended to ask how flat I could get with t-anchor.

 She said, why bother with the extra scar, and said buttonhole seems right for me. I didn't know anything about buttonhole so I feel like I didn't ask any questions I wanted. She said that unless I get D.I. Any surgery I get won't leave me flat, because 1.) I'm big, ""C+ or D"" she said. I have a really small rib cage so they just look so overwhelming. 2.) ""my tissue is like coconut meat, so dense"" üò≠  3.) because of sagging my ""pedicle"" is really long (I lost around 10 pounds a year or so ago) and that has to go somewhere if I'm not going to get the nips cut off and re attached.

If I do buttonhole, I can get down to a B, but it'll still look like a female chest. This is really disheartening. I wanted to be able to take my shirt off at the beach... 

She said a revision could be done later to lipo out any possible fat making them as small as possible, but couldn't guarantee they'd be much smaller.

Breast feeding, as much as I hate the concept, is kind of important to me. I have a killer immune system bc of my mom, and I want to be able to pass that along. Sensation is also important to me. Right now they're so sensitive they hurt when touched, but I think after surgery it'll be just... Normal possibly.

Whatever she asked (""where do you want the fullness? Like regular female breast? Like gynecomastia? Where do you want your nipples? How wide?"") I couldn't answer. I just didn't know. Because I was expecting the possibility of flatter results.

So my questions are... I guess

Did anyone get a reduction instead of complete flat?

What the fuck does a b cup even look like??  I thought I was close to a b cup but apparently not, and the Internet is very... Generous I think (hope?) with what they call a b cup, and most of the images I find are from porn anyway so I can't consider it realistic. 

Should I compromise with what I want? She said I could always just get DI later if I couldn't stand having something even if they're small, but would another surgery leave me more messed up? Would I have less feeling if I did it twice? Or would I just have to worry about healing twice and just the inconvenience of it?

2018-10-21 19:09:08,9q66m1,10,1,"So, I'm AMAB, and most people know me as being transgender, instead of non-binary, because it's a bit easier to explain.    


The way I think people perceive gender, I think, is by accessing ""files"" in their brain.  Due, largely to culture, I think just about everybody has a folder in their brain called ""gender,"" and 2 sub-folders for male and female, which each contain all the cultural assumptions associated with those genders such as: ""What is typical behavior for this gender?"" (someone can behave gender atypically, but it gets noticed (a man wearing makeup is a man wearing makeup, but a woman wearing makeup is just a woman)).  People basically make a series of assumptions about someone based on their gender, until proven otherwise.    


One of these assumptions in particular, is that most people (even though many won't admit it) see and treat men as being more of a potential threat than women (until shown otherwise).  Single fathers are often assumed to be pedophiles or rapists based on nothing but being alone with a child, while this doesn't cross anyone's mind when you see a woman alone with a child.  If a woman compliments another woman, it's seen as being genuinely nice, but if a man compliments anyone the first assumption is that he's trying to fuck.  


So, when people don't fall easily into one of those 2 categories, I think people sort of mentally create a new gender for that person, but also people try to do this with the minimum amount of mental work possible, so generally people are sorted as either a modified version of male or a modified version of female.  I think on the deepest level, most people perceive people AMAB nonbinary/transgender people as a modified version of male, and AFAB nonbinary/transgender people as a modified version of female.  


The modifications I think people make are mostly surface level.  The aspects of gender that are more often consciously thought about are modified to be in line with the gender wants to be perceived as (at best, although often not even that much).  I think the way people perceive me, who think of me as a transwoman, essentially attach me to the ""male"" folder in their brain, but it's a modified version, where they are trying to perceive me as a woman, so they rebuild the whole concept of womanhood, as much as they can into a modified version the ""male"" folder.  So, basically, in every way they can consciously think about it, I'm seen as a woman, but in all the subconscious ways that people don't talk about or want to openly admit, I'm seen as a man.  


So, the sort of way that men are seen as a bit more of a threat, I have that notion attached to me.  This makes seeking female friends a lot more difficult.  I think generally cishet people combat this by generally make other cishet friends of the same gender, at least at first.  A heterosexual man can approach another heterosexual man for friendship, without being seen as a threat because there is a balance of power, and then eventually prove to each other, and by extension each other's friend groups to not be a threat, and potentially make female friends by extension.  In the same sort of way, women can approach other women, because they don't see each other as threats in the first place.  In essence, it's a bit easier to make friends of one's own gender.  


The thing is, I don't really have that.  I have to prove to women that I'm not threatening, and because I'm not above any of the psychology here, I kinda need men to prove to me that they aren't threatening, and when it comes to other transgender/nonbinary people I have to deal with some sort of combination of those 2 things.

Currently, and for the last three months, I figured myself as non binary, demigender(woman). However I'm feeling myself change and I'm not sure why.   
AMAB, but do not want anything to do with male/masculine stuff. I'm on hrt to feminize, I try and hide masculine traits, and just be comfortable in my skin.   

However I know I'm not a woman. I don't feel like one, I don't want to be one, I don't want to be labeled as one... But my gender shifts very closely to that of one, so I felt demigender was pretty accurate. I'm very much andro/middle/none, and sometimes femme. It changes. Sometimes in the same day. Sometimes I'll be one for a few days. It hasn't caused too many issues because my style is that of comfy clothes and not really femme stuff like dresses, so I've been able to be comfortable.    

But something is not right and I don't know what. I'm beginning to doubt myself a lot. I'm getting a tiny bit dysphoric about thinking of where my breasts will grow to, yet a few hours later or the next day I'm happy and excited to see where they go. I'm happy about my body and then I'm hesitant.    

My shifts between femme and neutral are starting to become more noticeable and it feels like they are different things, instead of a bit of the two.     

Again, sorry. My brain is just a mess and I'm trying to think things through, but after reading this over it doesn't seem like I've thought much through at all.      

I guess I just don't know where I stand or what. Does *anyone* have experiences similar to this? I'm just so confused on how to feel about how I feel right now.     
I know genderflux is a term, but I don't really understand the percentages explanation so I don't know...

2018-10-24 15:57:06,9r0wuw,7,1,"Greetings my fellow gender non confirming friends,

I (AFAB) have been through a lot the past few months and am now seeking advice on my gender identity. I want to preface my post by saying that I grew up in a very conservative household. My parents are Russian and they don't believe in jomosexuality or in transgender people. Once I moved out I started exploring myself and my feelings more thoroughly. I knew I'm pansexual since puberty, but I have also been a tomboy since I was able to express my discomfort with dolls and everything with the colour pink. So since I moved out I have been experimenting with different kind of looks that I never could try out whilst living with my parents. I was not allowed to wear short dresses and didn't even think about binders and suits. But now I know that I feel very comfortable in boy mode. Of course I love to wear a dress once in while - they're comfortable as heck. 

However, I found the terms ""agender"" and ""non-binary"" on the internet and it seemed fitting. My parents would never know I identify as non binary and I don't have to come out, since I have always been kid of boyish and my language doesn't know any neutral pronouns. 

That's the story up until a few months ago. I began to remember episodes from my childhood, where I denied being a girl and where I felt humiliated when I was considered such. I began to realize that there is a reason I hate my breasts and therefore I should seek treatment, which wasn't easy to get in my city. The only help I received was a therapist who didn't even specialise in gender and sexuality, but she tried helping me find my identity nonetheless. She made me realize, that I have no fucking idea who I am. Considering my upbringing I could be a scared ftm who is afraid of social stigmata and hate as well as be a non binary person. I have been lurking in this subreddit as well as over there at r/ftm and I see myself in posts of both subreddits. 

So my question is, whether anybody here could help me find my peace regarding my gender. Is there anybody who felt similar and how did you find an answer? Is there such a thing as ""identifying as both agender and male, but not being gendefluid""? Are there any resources out there that I could read to get a better understanding of these issues? I know that my long term goal is transitioning. What I don't know is how far and what operations I want to get exactly. I'm afraid of T, but I am longing for top surgery. I am well aware that I need therapy, believe me, I'm on several waiting lists. The problem is that I am moving from city to city every few months to years and it is hard to find a therapist who would treat me longer than just a few months. If anybody is able to ease my mind until I get therapy, I would be very, very grateful. 

P.S. You are all lovely and beautiful people and it makes my day to look through the selfies posted here. Keep up the good spirit! I believe in you! üíï",NonBinary,Who even am I?,1540421826.0,"{'created_utc': 1540396626, 'id': '9r0wuw', 'num_comments': 7, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Greetings my fellow gender non confirming friends,\n\nI (AFAB) have been through a lot the past few months and am now seeking advice on my gender identity.

People that present clashing gendered cues of the kind that show the influence of both testosteron and estrogen (for example, a beard, deep voice, breasts, and hips at the same time) with the person not trying to hide the testosterone/estrogen side. Honestly, my ideal physical state is more important to me than pronouns, so even a binary woman that decided to proudly show off her beard or a binary guy who had gynecomastia and didn't care to hide it would feel more representative than the ""no gendered characteristics displayed"" or the binary-passing kind of nb. Not to dismiss those kinds of nb, or call binary people like that any less binary! It's just that kind of physical presentation is rare but important to me. Of course human, nonbinary-identity rep of this kind would be even more amazing.

Not to undervalue the nb representation that's been coming lately! Or nb youtubers! The rising positive/neutral representation lately is something I'm happy about, it's just not quite what I need, if that makes sense?

Gender fluidity and the concept of being non-binary has fascinated me for a while. Mainly because I have found it difficult to understand, and partly because I want to understand.

I'm always on the side of people following the path that makes them comfortable, with the usual caveat of it not causing harm to others, so I hope I'm not offending anyone with my upcoming thoughts and questions. Having given this issue a lot of thought I'd like to ask the following:

1) Why and how does the spectrum of gender, differ from the spectrum of character/traits/experience of being a male or female?

2) By identifying as non-binary, are you not by default defining what it is to be male or female, and therefore limiting the spectrum of male/female experience?

3) Would/could it be empowering to broaden the perception and expectation of what it means to be biologically male or female, rather than distancing yourself from what you feel society expects of those genders? Would your disassociation from those genders be lessened if a broader spectrum of each of those was more readily visible and accepted in society?

I've recently found out about this sub and after reading previous posts, I have a few questions, and if it doesn't go against the sub's rules, I would like you to answer

Firstly, I would like to start by congratulating all of you for this safe environment that you've created

Secondly, I'm a Spanish speaker and i have studied English for a few years. I've learned how to treat people in my first language, but I still need help with my second language, English.

Regarding the questions, if someone doesn't identity as a male/woman. Is it ok to use the adjectives beautiful/handsome with them? 

Also, is it rude to ask what gender someone identifies with? Is there a more polite way to ask it? Please, don't get me wrong here. As a not native speaker of the language, I'm in constant 'fear' of making mistakes by using it. And I don't want to offend someone by mistaking their identity.

Also, in Spanish I can talk to/about a person without saying any pronoun. In English it is more difficult to do it (at least for me). Is it rude if I start using the pronoun 'they' when addressing someone? (Bearing in mind that they could actually be a he or a she)

Finally, do you get offended when people refer to a group of people with 'guys'? I've learned that, for example, I could say 'good morning guys' even if there aren't only males. Would it be ok if I say 'thanks guys' in this sub?

Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm a freelance writer working with Teen Vogue and Broadly. 

For Teen Vogue I'm looking to interview non-binary people who are in a current \[or past\] relationship and have dating advice for other within the gender nonconforming community. 

For Broadly I'm looking for non-binary people who may have self-care tips or positive coping mechanisms as it pertains to transphobia, gender dysphoria, and the overall challenges of living as a non-binary person in general. 

For either, contact me [SerenaSonoma1@gmail.com](mailto:SerenaSonoma1@gmail.com) to set up an email or phone interview.

2018-10-29 22:08:55,9sht6m,9,1,"Hey everyone, 
As the title suggests, I‚Äôm confused about my gender identity and I was hoping you could give me some advice. Since I came to college just over a year ago I‚Äôve been able to grow as a person and become more myself. A part of this process has been having a better understanding of my gender. Though I have identified as a man, practically my entire life, I also felt like there was something off about the whole thing in my case. Thanks to a conversation I had with a friend who is also questioning their gender identity, I have been able to articulate this ‚Äòoff-ness‚Äô better. I do feel like I am partially male, but at the same time this feels restrictive and not entirely accurate. There is also a part of me which I would say is either neutral, or without gender at all.

There are a lot of things that I want to try out (like becoming more androgynous in my appearance) but at the same time am really scared to do. Though my university is very progressive and accepting, the same cannot necessarily be said about the town I live in, unfortunately. At the same time, I do feel like a bit of an impostor at moments; as of now I‚Äôm not even sure if I‚Äôm really not just male, or if I am just making things up. There is also a part of me that wonders if I should even bother, given that this will cause me a lot of hassle in terms of incomprehension from the people around me. I also don‚Äôt really have any dysphoria about my body, and I‚Äôm pretty ok with people using male pronouns for me (though I also like the idea of neutral pronouns, and I also wouldn‚Äôt mind if people used female ones). Even so, I feel like I would be happier if peoples‚Äô image of me was more in line with how I feel.

So, what do you think? Do you have any advice about what I could or should do?
