2018-11-01 13:11:25,9t9a1b,3,1,"I had posted this in r/androgynoushotties and someone recommended that I post it here.

When I was younger, I always found myself attracted to tomboyish women who were confident. This usually lead to me having crushes on lesbians more often than straight women.

Just for context- I am a genetic male and the world sees me that way. I am okay that people call me cisgendered even if nonbinary may seem like a more accurate definition. I sometimes feel like I want to be a girl and other times I like being a guy. I am an attractive guy to others but I'm also a masculine guy. I don't find that masculinity attractive. I would love to look androgynous. I think who I am as a person is both a guy and a girl's mind. That mentality. I don't care whether the world accepts that or uses any specific pronoun. I just want to be happy with myself.

My presence here also has much to do with satisfying my curiosity. I love having a better understanding of why people feel and behave the way they do. Understanding others helps me better understand myself. In the past few months I've picked up an interest in researching quantum computing, quantum mechanics, and quantum physics. Everything is quantum. There is so much I don't know about the subject but I try to learn as much as I can because I strongly believe that it's only a matter of time before quantum computing becomes mainstream. And when quantum computing becomes mainstream people will stop thinking binary. Classical computing operates on a binary system. Which has worked great for a long time. When people feel that qbits are common sense they will have a better foundation for understanding complicated gender identities and sexualities.

Binary thinking enforces this fallacy that if you aren't one thing then you are the opposite. That's a fallacy. If it isn't day time than it's nighttime completely disregards early morning and evening. Quantum physics makes it understandable that something can be YES and NO or 1 and 0 at the same time. When something is measured, it collapses into a state of 1 or 0. I encourage everyone, especially people who are interested in a more progressive world, to research this subject.

If you understand our universe, you will understand the humans in it and you will better understand yourself. You and I are the same. My right hand doesn't stab my left hand because it is different. Two parts of the same whole. Find someone who believes the opposite of you. Understanding someone who you disagree with will make you stronger and could possibly encourage them to better understand you. The right hand and the left hand can lift so much more together than they can independently of one another. 

I love reading about conservatives like Steven Crowder and Mark Rubio- not because I agree with them but because I disagree with them. I am a neutral person. It's hard for me to empathize with the right or left because I feel for both sides and wish both sides would aspire to be more tolerant of each other and better communicate with one another.

2018-11-02 03:20:13,9tgiiw,6,1,"Hello everyone, 

I haven't really posted here much, I'm mainly a lurker. But I know info on T+Fin is of interest and very hard to find especially from the nb angle.

Sorry I don't have a video. I am too self-conscious to do vid updates :S

Note that I am also on Wellbutrin (have been for a while) which is known to affect things like libido (though usually increases it, which I did not find to be the case for me) as well as other potential things T/Fin might have affected, so keep that in mind.

Some background: I started T and Fin at the same time. I'm on 50mg of T cypionate subq weekly and 1.25mg of Fin daily. I am 5'4"" and 120lbs, pretty petite and very ""cute"" in a way that has people vastly underestimate my age. I am 29 and have never passed as male no matter what my hair and clothes are. I have pretty wide hips and smallish chest, so I'm starting out here with a figure that'll never pass as male without some serious help. My starting voice is pretty high and pretty Californian and if I try to through it lower I just sound like ruby from steven universe lol.

What I wanted from T: voice, muscles, change in body shape, and a better self image, more energy

What I didn't want: body hair, facial hair, losing hair, bottom growth, high sex drive, the supposed thicker feeling skin? That's kind of whatever but I like my skin how it is so. Being smelly. Acne. 

Anyway so with all that in mind here is what has happened over 3 months on T+Fin.

&amp;#x200B;

Hair:

* No changes in body hair. The actual hairs haven't gotten thicker/darker, nor has more of it appeared.
* No facial hair at all.
* I feel like my head hair is thinner? Which it really shouldn't be... so I'm thinking it's just psychological or because I've bleached it too much lately. I have really thin and fine hair to begin with. My hair is not my glory lol.
* I haven't noticed a change in hairline, but I started with a pretty masculine hairline to begin with.

Voice

* I don't think my speaking voice has changed as no one has commented on it, but I can definitely sing several notes lower than I ever could before. So whatever changes there have been a gradual thing, no cracking, nothing sudden.

Body:

* I have noticeably larger arm muscles. I can feel them even when I am not flexing. 
* No bottom growth (I think?)
* Period is regular.
* Maybe libido increased a little? Nothing really dramatic. Some people on T say you get dramatic orgasms lol. This hasn't happened. I am ace and started with a low libido though.
* I don't know if I've had any changes in body shape. My pants fit the same. Maybe my shoulders have more muscle, but that I think is all if anything.
* Body smell hasn't changed. Pee smell maybe? But it isn't dramatically noticeable.
* Yeah pimples :( But I have struggled with them as an adult so much that I have been on low dose accutane on and off for a while, and was for the first month or two but ran out a few weeks ago and the pimples have come back nooo but so far have been manageable.
* No changes in hands or feet.
* Face looks the same I think.
* Skin feels the same.
* Energy level is the same.
* Appetite is the same.

Mental:

* I haven't noticed any significant changes in how I feel mentally or emotionally.
* I think I'm a little sleepier. I was really sleepy the first week but now it's leveled out, although when I hit my bedtime I'm really ready to sleep.

So I thiiiiink that's all I really have to say...

**TL;DR better arm muscles, can sing lower notes, no other significant changes yet.**

I will try to post an update again in a few months.

If you have any questions, you can ask, though I don't really have much more to add.

I hate this myth. I'm still hung up on it. I don't know what to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone else get feelings like? What do you tell yourself? How do you motivate or trick yourself into taking action / taking any direction at all even just for the sake of changing something rather than nothing?\n\nFor what it's worth I have ADHD-PI but feel more comfortable posting here than on an ADHD sub.\n\nThanks for reading.

2018-11-03 07:22:12,9ts90p,4,1,"I am AFAB. I identify as genderles but for years I've been telling everyone I'm a trans man. I did this because I knew this was the best way for people to take the fact that I'm transgender seriously and for them to use he/him pronouns for me which are one of my preferred pronouns.

Last year I met a trans men who, let's just say, hasn't got the nicest opinions when it comes to people who view themselves outside of the binary. We got into an argument and I told him I was genderqueer. I thought him actually knowing someone outside of the binary in person might help him realise that, yes, people like us exist and we're not just doing this for attention.

Yeah, that's not what happened. He's still against people like me and he outed me to my mom and the head of our LGBT support group. I did not want people to know, I was not ready to come out, and he knew this. 

I'm lucky that they took it well. The head of my group even said she thought I was non-binary when we first met. I have no idea who else he told and I'm still scared to be really open about it, even on the internet. It's only really non-binary specific spaces like this where I really feel like I can talk about it.

My therapist who's helping me transition is organising a picnic next month for all his trans patients to get together and get to know one another.

I basically dropped everything I was holding and stammered something about ""Yeah, of course, please do, everybody else does outside of here,"" and she said ""Great!"" and walked away.

2018-11-05 21:25:20,9uhs00,2,1,"Hi, I'm afab and have identified as cis ever since I learned the word. As I've grown as a person, become more accepting of others, and learned more and more terms, I've started wondering if maybe cis female isn't actually what I am. 

Why I might be:

I'm definitely more feminine than not, but being a girl has never been super important to me. In elementary school most, if not all my friends were boys. I rejected pink clothes, preferred ""boy toys"" like Transformers, and only asked for Barbies if they came with pets (I loved animals). I would toss the doll aside and play with the horse or dog instead. Sometimes I would use the Dolls as Pokemon trainers, but never played with them the way they were intended. 

My mother called me a tomboy, but this has the connotation of being sporty and masculine. I never liked sports. I'm the only person of any gender in my immediate family who doesn't, and I never considered myself masculine. Maybe ""boyish"" when I was a child. But that only referred to my interests. I was a nerd. Nowadays geek and nerd are gender neutral, but when I was a kid, I was strange for not liking the things girls should like, and liking the things boys should like.

My name is feminine, but not the most girly sounding thing I've ever heard, and while I don't particularly like the sound of it, I do appreciate that I wasn't named Macy like my father wanted. My mom told me some of the names she wanted before she knew what sex I was. Tristan if I was a boy, and Cameron for either a boy or a girl. I prefer both of those over my own name. But I'm not sure if what I like is the masculinity/androgyny, or if they're just more pleasant sounding to me than my actual name.

When I was in middle school, I would often imagine I was a girl dressed up as a boy, tricking everyone and only telling the people she trusted. I think I got this idea from the episode of Fairly Oddparents when Trixie disguises herself as a boy to hide the fact that she likes comic books. I thought the need to hide her interests was stupid, but found her ability to pass herself off as a boy very interesting. I had similar feelings about Mulan (actually, when I was *very* young, I didn't even realize the men didn't know she was a woman for most of the movie. Completely missed the main point lol).

I never wanted to be a boy though. I never had any problem with my body other than the type of dissatisfaction that comes with weight gain from puberty. I realized early on that I wasn't straight, but gender stuff that wasn't cis confused me, and nonbinary gender confused me even more at first. 

But the more I learned about nonbinary genders, the less confused I became. But the *more* confused I became about them in relation to myself. 

Why I might not be:

Many nonbinary people's stories sound something like ""I identified as ftm for a while and that was better than female, but I still hated it. And then I learned the word nonbinary and immediately started crying because everything fell into place.""

As you can probably guess, this is not me. All the gender problems I've ever had have been pretty vague. A lot of it was probably internalized misogyny (I'm not like other girls) and some of it was probably internalized homophobia (boys like girls, but I like girls and I'm a girl?)

I haven't found a term that fits me. I'm not agender or neutrois or anything like that. I'm definitely female-aligned if I'm nonbinary at all. The closest I've found is demigirl, but I hate how cutesie it sounds (and demiwoman is so many syllables), and I don't think the ""partially this, partially that"" idea works for me.

Juxera is also close. But it's so uncommon it's hard to find Juxeras who have told their story so that I may compare myself to them.

I'm torn between ""everyone should explore their gender identity at least once"" and ""even if I find out I'm not a cis woman, is it even worth it? Because I'd still be so close to female on the gender spectrum""

This is mostly just me dumping my thoughts and feelings into the void. But if anyone has any advice I welcome it.",NonBinary,Why I might be Nonbinary vs Why I might not be,1541478320.0,"{'created_utc': 1541453120, 'id': '9uhs00', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Hi, I\'m afab and have identified as cis ever since I learned the word.

I\'m not agender or neutrois or anything like that. I\'m definitely female-aligned if I\'m nonbinary at all. The closest I\'ve found is demigirl, but I hate how cutesie it sounds (and demiwoman is so many syllables), and I don\'t think the ""partially this, partially that"" idea works for me.\n\nJuxera is also close. But it\'s so uncommon it\'s hard to find Juxeras who have told their story so that I may compare myself to them.\n\nI\'m torn between ""everyone should explore their gender identity at least once"" and ""even if I find out I\'m not a cis woman, is it even worth it? Because I\'d still be so close to female on the gender spectrum""\n\nThis is mostly just me dumping my thoughts and feelings into the void. But if anyone has any advice I welcome it.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Why I might be Nonbinary vs Why I might not be', 'created': 1541478320.0}"

2018-11-06 11:02:03,9unej5,3,1,"Hi, I’m new in here but i’ve been a lurker for a while. 

Everything started because my partner began to identify as non binary not long after i first met them, 6 months ago. I was kind of freaked out at first, because I kind of felt the same? and it had always been a source of confusion and shame for me. 

Since then the non-binary “thing” has grown a lot in me.

But using they/them pronouns doesn’t feel right , and using she/her is beggining to bother me, which makes me feel now perpetually uncofortable. I am more in the male spectrum than the female one, and though i don’t feel male it is bothering me a lot that even if i bind my chest people still see me as she/her. It is not that I want to be seen as male but I’d really appreciate if I could at least generate some confusion.

I haven’t really tried using male pronouns to refer to myself because i’m afraid it will generate tension with my partner. I didn’t feel this uncofortable with myself before and I don’t really understand what’s happening to me. I’n beggining to not be confortable with my name? Dunno. I’m beggining to really feel that masculine part of myself pushing and pulling.

Any advice?

Yesterday I felt myself actually feeling “trapped in the wrong body” for the first time. I’ve experienced dysphoria for years but I’ve always resisted the “wrong body” narrative for myself because this IS my body, and even though it causes me discomfort, it’s what I have to work with. Its taken me awhile to realize how much dysphoria I have as a whole (vs just my chest or my voice) and it’s so... strange to look in the mirror and feel totally disconnected and resentful of what you see. And it’s making me hate myself. 

It’s like being on T and experiencing gradual changes has made me finally understand that I do want a “male” looking body. And it’s so hard for me to accept that still. And I get more and more confused about my gender, because I really don’t feel “male” and don’t want to be boxed into the opposite binary box — but why do I want/need(?) a clearly masculine body so badly? I’ve tried to tell myself to not worry “what it means” to have this type of dysphoria. But. I don’t know. I don’t feel at peace with myself at the moment.

I thought I had a solid grasp of what it meant to me to be nonbinary, but I’m not sure who I am anymore.

Having a full functional package? No. Having a half functional but full size package? No. But I wish I had a 2-3 inch wien. Why? No idea. It's not even practical for penetration, which is an ability I really wish I had. But I would feel so comfortable if I had a small dick instead of the vajene.

2018-11-08 17:11:40,9vbudo,3,1,"Ok so first of all, I’m pretty young (I’m a teenager) so I’m probably not entirely sure about everything. I was born a girl, and throughout pretty much all of my life I’ve “identified” as one, probably because everyone told me that I was one and I didn’t know that trans/nb people even existed. Recently in the past year or so I’ve began to come to terms with my sexuality after developing a crush on a girl, however I also learned about gender identity, and how people can be neither male or female.

I don’t think that I have any “sense” of gender. I don’t really have a feeling of “I am a girl” or “I am a boy”, I just feel like “me”, and have felt like this growing up, even before I started questioning. I’ve only talked to a few people (who are cis girls) about how I feel and they said they had a strong sense of gender. I don’t think I do. 

I don’t feel any significant dysphoria. I do feel a little strange/uncomfortable when people refer to me as “she” or call me a girl. I’m also not really a huge fan of my chest, but neither of these issues cause me any significant distress or upset, which makes me wonder if these issues are just kinda made up? However, the uncomfortable feeling I get when referred to as female especially seems pretty real, so this is a pretty good indicator that something’s going on. I also like to refer to myself as a “boy” as a half-joke, as it feels less awkward than referring to myself as a “girl”. I’d quite like to have a deeper voice as well (I once got jealous of a female voice actor who could voice a male with a deep voice).

I feel happy when I cut my hair short and I feel really happy and comfortable with shorter hair. I don’t know if this is just personal preference though. My clothing is pretty androgynous (I wear “whatever” and in formal occasions I feel a lot more “myself” wearing a suit than a dress. I like to wear makeup, but I don’t really see that as “gendered”. But then again, clothes/style don’t really matter too much as a girl can wear masculine things and vice versa.

I think that I might be agender or some other sort of non-binary gender, but I’m not sure, because although I can get by being seen as a girl, I would prefer a gender neutral name and pronouns. I’m not sure though as I’ve only really discovered these feelings recently.

Any advice on how I can know this for sure?

Some time ago I bought a binder from gc2b. It was a full tank-length style binder, and I liked it fine, except that when I sat while wearing it, the compression panel came down low enough that it cut into my tummy and made me look like I had the muffin top from hell. I later learned this is because the full-length tank styles were meant for people with more abundant breast tissue, which absolutely does not describe me. 

So recently I bought two more binders, in the half-length style. I like them quite a bit, the size is good, and for the most part, they're comfy. The problem is that now the bottoms roll/bunch up a lot, and at the end of a work day I've got bunched up material kind of digging into me, right around where the bottom bra band would sit. 

Turns out I've got a pretty short torso, all things considered; on top of that I'm very pear-shaped and that A-line flare (for lack of a better term) starts pretty high up. Is there anything I can do to help prevent binders from rolling or bunching up like this?

Basically, I'm really confident in my sexuality and presentation, I love being lesbian and acting feminine but aesthetically going for more masculine looks. I usually present pretty butch (and otherwise might be stone butch idk yet) and feel feminine and have no issues with that. But I still have dysphoria around my body and not wanting some actual physical organs (like, I love having boobs, but, if I didn't have junk downstairs and it could just not exist on me, that would be awesome)? And like, my gender presentation and pronouns match my birth gender so I'm pretty sure I'm cis?

But I kinda also want to be physically sexless?

Is there a word for that? I don't really feel like it changes anything identity wise, but I don't know how to classify this and if it goes into nonbinary/agender/physically androgynous territory? Particularly if I don't feel like, as far as my physical body goes, I want to be ""gendered"" (I don't have the right word there I think, b/c it isn't gender that is the problem?). Like, my gender isn't the issue (I hate being misgendered with male pronouns when I have short hair), so it's the physical stuff that is.

Mentally I feel like a woman and love that aspect of myself... So is this even a thing? B/c I don't feel like nb fits me either because physically I just want to be off the spectrum entirely, but I'm not sure if nb is only applied to gender expression anyway and I'm using the terms wrong...

So how do you define this stuff and does anyone have links to things that can answer this? Is there another sub I should ask this? Is this even a thing?

I don\'t really feel like it changes anything identity wise, but I don\'t know how to classify this and if it goes into nonbinary/agender/physically androgynous territory? Particularly if I don\'t feel like, as far as my physical body goes, I want to be ""gendered"" (I don\'t have the right word there I think, b/c it isn\'t gender that is the problem?). Like, my gender isn\'t the issue (I hate being misgendered with male pronouns when I have short hair), so it\'s the physical stuff that is.\n\nMentally I feel like a woman and love that aspect of myself... So is this even a thing? B/c I don\'t feel like nb fits me either because physically I just want to be off the spectrum entirely, but I\'m not sure if nb is only applied to gender expression anyway and I\'m using the terms wrong...\n\nSo how do you define this stuff and does anyone have links to things that can answer this? Is there another sub I should ask this? Is this even a thing?\n\nDoes this fall under the nb umbrella?', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': ""I'm looking for resources to get a way to personally label things for myself?

*Here's a bit of backstory if you're interested. If you've just come for the question, skip to the next paragraph.* The last few months has been a process. I've been slowly piecing things together and have come to realize I'm Non-Binary! Part of this process has obviously been about coming to terms with it myself and working out how I'd like other people to address it. I've been gearing my wardrobe toward a more androgynous appeal for a few years, so most of my physical appearance is already where I want (I just shaved my beard off this morning so hurray!). 

Now that I'm starting to come out to a few of my closer friends I feel like I have to figure out my pronouns. But here's the rub; I don't actually care. He, She, They you name it, I'll probably answer if I realize that you're address me. I've felt like this my whole life. I don't want to make this **more** difficult for those around me by not having a concrete answer. Everyone else seems very sure of their pronouns, and I don't want to take away from their experience/struggle by haphazardly suggesting it doesn't matter. 

So here's my question: *Does not choosing concrete pronouns hurt the community?*

I'm interested to hear the Reddit community's take on pronouns. Any suggestions for navigation this are also appreciated!

2018-11-12 18:20:13,9wghml,30,1,"Hello siblings!

So I got a bit of a backlash in a thread recently when questioning to myself whether I should use ""they is"" or ""they are."" I'm here to make the case for ""they is,"" both from a linguistic and a pride point of view. Obviously in the end do what you want and what feels right for you. I just want to make people think about it. Language is a tool defined by its usage, and there's no ""right"" way to do anything. Also I'm making the case for using the third person singular form of the verb in **all** cases, it just happens that ""is/are"" is more distinct and very common and easy to give clear examples for. 

A bit of background - I'm older than most people on this sub, 38, I teach 2 foreign languages for a living, have taken classes in linguistics (and have studied the topic on my own quite a bit), and am American. The last part is relevant because apparently schools here held onto plural-only they a lot longer than most places. It was beaten into our heads growing up that ""they"" is plural only and to use clunky constructions like ""he or she"" and ""his or hers"" as in ""He or she is going to be very upset when he or she sees his or her grade.""  I still occasionally have trouble parsing in my brain that they is being used for one specific person **despite preferring it myself**. It's happened a couple times specifically on a Gritty FB shitposting group where it will say something like ""they are fighting for the workers"" and I wonder what group ""they"" is referring to until I realize that Gritty is non-binary as well and amazing and wonderful. Anyway that lets you know where I'm coming from and I promise I'm making the point in good faith and am not attacking anyone (as noted above, I prefer ""they"" myself). I'm willing to accept a lot of this may be my personal hangups and existential crisis as someone who doesn't believe in a gender binary yet teaches languages where it's deeply ingrained. At least I've managed to make it a platform to bring up and reinforce the idea of non-binary-ness. 

First of all it's important to point out that yes, singular ""they"" has been in use for hundreds of years, and many of us, myself included, have been quick to point that out to others. However, in the vast majority of the cases it's been used to refer to a **non-specific** subject. The usage of ""they"" to refer to a **singular specific** person has only become common and widely understood and ""accepted"" of late, easily within the last decade (see Abadi, Mark (8 January 2016). ""'They' was just named 2015's Word of the Year"". Business Insider.). I think we should shift usage of the verb to fit the shifted usage of the pronoun. (I also think we need to stop with the ""singular 'they' has been used for hundreds of years!"" argument, as it's really not one made in good faith, frankly). 

""They is"" reinforces the singular, *specific* ""they"". Any other third person singular specific subject in a sentence uses ""is."" To say ""they are"" forces a verb change when the subject's name is replaced with the pronoun, which otherwise doesn't happen in any person. ""Avery is going to the mall."" - &gt; ""They *are* going to the mall"" vs. ""He/She/Ze/Etc. *is* going to the mall."" ""Alex and I are going to the mall. "" - &gt; ""We are going to the mall."" etc. It could be *interpreted* (not by me) as either dehumanizing or demanding to be referred to a way that acts like the ""royal we"" (using plural pronouns and verbs to refer to one's self as royalty does - see Chris Collins, Paul Martin Postal, Imposters: A Study of Pronominal Agreement (2012, ISBN 0262016885)). French has a similar case in the second person, where ""vous"" is historically a plural pronoun now used in the singular formal (a usage started with royalty that trickled down to all formal usage eventually). Using the third person plural form of the verb is simply different from any gendered person, and I think the goal for most of us is for us as individuals and as a group to be seen as ""normal"" with a different little part of us that doesn't define us. 

tl;dr - The part of one's brain that goes ""'they is' just sounds wrong"" is the same part that, for many people, says ""using 'they' for a singular specific person just sounds wrong."" Since we're changing one I think it's right to change the other to match.

I’m an AFAB enby and I wear a 30 i - even if I wasn’t trans, I doubt I’d be pleased with my bust because it’s just so disproportionately large on my small frame it’s comical. I want something small and neutral, like an a or a b cup that could easily just be pecs or some displaced fat on a masc person but also could just be very small tiddies on a femme person. So it’s not the fact that I have breasts that’s an issue, it’s the fact I have huge, unignorable breasts that’s lead many of my past partners to joke about me being an ancient goddess of fertility/femininity/whatever.

My bare chest has always made me violently dysphoric and these days seeing it makes me cry. I also can’t stand how it feels to go braless; I hate the feeling of weight pulling on my chest and the skin hitting that of my stomach. Unfortunately, I don’t have the time or money for top surgery right now. Plus, I have too much breast tissue and not enough other body fat for binders to work for me. They’re so uncomfortable and the shape they give me makes me feel even worse about my body. All I can do right now is put on a bra so I don’t have to feel or see my chest and go about my life. 

Which would be fine for the time being if every bra in my size wasn’t disgustingly feminine. It’s hard enough just finding a bra in my size at all, much less one that fits and feels right, and at that point, my options are so few I don’t get to be choosy about aesthetics. But now I’m seeing all these awesome masc/gender nonconforming/neutral bras and it hurts that I will never have that. Even if a bra happens to come in my size (which is a real if), it’s clearly not made for a chest my size.

2018-11-13 05:22:22,9wm6ja,4,1,"Howdy folks. I would greatly appreciate some feedback on my current situation. 

My presentation is all over the place. I was AFAB and some of my secondary sexual characteristics are very noticeable. More often than not people defer to she/her pronouns regardless of how I am presenting. This typically doesn’t particularly bother me and doesn’t cause any dysphoria. It does always cheer me up when folks use he/him or they/them or use more masculine language when referring to me. A few years ago I went by they/them pronouns exclusively. While the people closest to me did attempt to make an adjustment it never really felt genuine and asking for people to stop using she/her almost felt insincere? If that makes sense. It would sometimes feel as if I was asking for something I didn’t fully believe I needed. Nowadays I just roll with she/her but when asked what pronouns I prefer I find myself always hesitating to answer. I don’t have any attachment or connection to she/her but answering “I’m good with whatever” seems dismissive or even a bit snide? The last thing I want to do is treat pronouns as if they are something trivial. 

To further complicate things I recently lost 90 pounds. While I am happy with my weight loss it accentuates parts of my body a lot more than before. I’ve been getting unwanted attention and have felt so much more vulnerable. Before the weight loss I saw my body as something substantial and grounded. I felt strong and more secure in my space and gender identity. Now everything has shifted. I’m trying to rebalance myself and reconnect with my body. My hope is that being able to better articulate my pronoun preference and stop defaulting to she/her for the sake of convenience will help me find that balance/reconnect. 

I want to find a way to communicate I am open to any pronouns and have no attachment to any particular ones while still treating pronouns with respect. Has anyone else experienced something similar? Any insight or guidance would be greatly appreciated.

2018-11-13 18:55:11,9wrwdi,0,1,"Hey everyone, sorry if this gets lengthy but I feel the context is necessary- 

I’m a 28 yo AFAB enby who has been working for the same company for about 4.5 years. This company is a large corporate non profit that provides behavioral and mental health care. For the first 2.5-3 years of working there, I presented relatively femme due to societal pressures to conform to female professionalism. Around 1.5 years ago, I cut my hair short, started binding my large chest, and dressing significantly more masculine and androgynous. At this time, I shortened my traditionally feminine name to my nickname which is more androgynous and started asking to be referred to using they/them pronouns. I was honestly very naive in expecting that a non profit specializing in mental health care would be more receptive. There was some performative sort of respect for about two weeks, whereupon everyone then returned to using my female pronouns and name. This is hurtful and disappointing, but I can accept this. 

What I cannot accept however, is the reaction from two men in particular on my team. Both of these cis white males have expressed their “discomfort” and “issues” with the trans community, one of them calling us “unnatural” and the other saying it goes against his religious beliefs. Both of these individuals think they do a good job of separating these personal beliefs from their work and professionalism, however, I’ve experienced some subtle microaggressions from them ever since coming out and I don’t know what to do. Gendered comments, little put downs and scoffs, going out of their way to try to make uncomfortable small talk that is vaguely aggressive with me, complimenting me in gendered ways. One of the individuals followed me out to my car in the parking lot and was speaking to me in a dominating kind of way as I was clearly trying to not have conversation and get in my car to go home. All of these behaviors have been extremely subversive, so I feel like if I were to call them out directly or to a supervisor, I would not have solid ground to stand on and it would just hurt my professional reputation and connections. I feel sexually objectified, vaguely threatened and intimidated, and at the very least quite uncomfortable. I am already avoiding these men as much as possible. I am locked into a contract w my agency and otherwise love my job and work as well, so leaving the agency is not really an option.

2018-11-15 00:13:53,9x5txn,1,1,"One thing I keep hearing is that transpeople are (apparently) sometimes overly stereotypical of their chosen gender. This led me to think about how I heard that gender is better defined as a spectrum inside a triangle (hence title, pls don't shoot):  
So let's imagine we have an image of a triangle with a gradient inside: Pink in one corner, which would be female, blue in another corner, which would be male, and white for nonbinary (in this case used as an umbrella term for any gender that would be an extreme different from male and female instead of the actual color gradient of our triangle) in the third corner. As genderfluidity is a thing we'll allow anyone to either mark a specific spot or an entire area.

You'd think cisgender would be on the tip of either male or female, right? What if we put the average cisgender person on about 75% instead of 100% into their corner? That would leave some space for people to be overly male/female. If that just means stereotypically male/female is open for interpretation, but consider that a large amount of the population is rather apathetic towards questioning their gender is such a way to begin with as they simply accept their gender is the one matching their sex as assigned at birth. Meanwhile (just as an example!) a transperson (who is not nonbinary) will initially what to go to their chosen gender's extreme is far as possible - way beyond the average cisperson of that gender - or until reaching a point where they have beaten their dysphoric feelings and can accept their ""new"" spot/area on our theoretical triangle.

Next thing I was thinking about is where to place Agender and if I should at all. You could put them right in the middle because they'd be equally far away from all 3 extremes on our spectrum. But wouldn't they be placed more correctly outside the triangle, leaving a hole in that concept? Now if we consider that there are Agenderfluid people, who's area would be partially inside and partially the outside of the triangle I'm pretty much convinced that I can't describe gender on a 2D plane at all if we want the base to be a simply geometric shape. I wouldn't know where to place myself in what I thought up either.

**TL;DR**: Gender is a spectrum, but too complicated to visually describe based on a simple two-dimensional geometric shape like a triangle, because there are people outside that triangle. The point I wanted to originally make is that the average is not the extreme of their gender because some people are perceived as ""overly male/female"".

**PS**.: Wow this turned into quite a wall of text. I'd just like to clarify that I am merely overthinking an idea I got from reading various opinions online.

2018-11-15 18:30:54,9xdu8u,18,1,"Hi r/NonBinary! This is my first post.

I’ve come to realize that I have an extremely difficult time being sexually/romantically/etc attracted to people who aren’t somewhere on the spectrum of gender non-conformity (at least gender-apathetic).

I suppose that, for instance, if a cis man who mostly identifies as straight finds me attractive and wants to date me; I can’t shake the feeling that I’m “basically” a girl in their mind. Lots of people will eventually use the right pronouns/words for me, but I struggle to return their romantic or sexual inclinations even once they’ve started to gender me correctly 100% of the time.

Whereas, one of my partners now, is a bisexual “I don’t really care about gender” AMAB person who understood and gendered me correctly from the start. I think he’s called me “she” once in 5.5 years.

I don’t really know how to approach this realization or how to communicate to people who express interest in me *why* I’m not interested in them. I suppose much of it is my own insecurity, but I sort of feel it is a well-founded one.

I tend to agree with most of what the man has to say, even if i choose to ignore a large part of it later. but on explaining his thought process breaking down gender he quotes.. It all comes down to one center concept.

FASHION.

So i reflect on that... no.. i dont think so JP.. theres got to be more to gender then that.  BUT.. as I become less and less enamored with my gender, norms, expectations etc in this changing world.. non binary.. is starting to make sense to me. and frankly, for many other reasons, i see why it makes sense to many others.. as well.

So I come to this reddit to glean more information only to discover a subreddit over half full of all you pouges posting pictures of yourselves along with commentary on how you want other people to perceive you or how your looks make you feel.. and all I can think is .. ""seriously"" 'how fucking shallow'.. and also.. 'If i want to go non binary do i have to start dressing like these hacks!!?""

The way people dress or their expectations of others therefore mean very very little to me. and I dont really care how \*I\* look, with the occasional exceptions of going out in public so filthy people could not easily believe I am a brilliant creator and skilled artisan, but also my complete disreguard for personal asthetic represents a level of performance and accomplishment they have no chance of ever achieving. But none of them are paying me.. so I dont really care. Its like bro, I make ten times more then you as a strung out homeless tweaker so give me my change and eye fuck someone else.

When I look at pictures on this sub.. I 'see'... people trying to compensate. over compensate. but,... &gt;&gt;FOR WHAT REASON&lt;&lt;. is it lack of confidence. desire for recognition. trying to separate yourself from your homogeneous group by altering composition? or does compensation have nothing to do with it at all.?

WHY DOES IT MATTER WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE. &lt;&lt;&lt;please for the love of god.. in expanded paragraph form.. help me with this&lt;&lt;&lt;

IS NON-BINARY.. IS GENDER.. JUST FASHION? and if not.. what else is to this thing..? what do they them.. you.. you   
 people?&gt;? what do you stand for here. fashion breakthrough. or....?????????  I sure hope its the ability to explain things.

\*\*\*

And then as for your identity.. these god damn pronouns. the other solid remaining portion of this sub full of ... wellmy 'whoever' or 'what ever' wont use/respect/aknowledge my prounouns.

what the fuck with these pronouns, and why do you require them. again, lack of self confidence. you feel a need to be respected. force respect.. through acknowledgement..?

&amp;#x200B;

I AM AN OUTLIAR!  ...am I just lucky..? (cursed?)  IVE ALWAYS KNOWN WHO I AM. \*\*IM ME\*\* 

&amp;#x200B;

Call me 'she'. I dont give a fuck. If its not intentionally meant to mock and offend... then its just an honest mistake.. and who cares either way. For some reason... a ton of people have called me 'STEVE' on the job or when I show up to their house. Im horrible with names (thats why these pronouns scare the shit out of me too)If you want to call me Steve.. Im not going to correct you. My name is printed clearly on any correspondence you used to make contact with me. The only time I will correct people is right before theyre about to write me a check. sometimes I just ask to make it out to my brother..

Ive always been me. When I go through hard times: Im the confused Me. An audible noise people make.. does not define my identity. It has no ability to  categorize who and what I am on the etheral plains of existence

so.. wtf with you guys. is everyone here just so... (i keep thinking 'insecure..') so.. at a lack of their own identity.. that this suddenly becomes an impassible issue until solved? or is it because just dressing half queer doesnt take you all the way into new gender territory.

and why do my thoughts or judgement on YOUR LOOKS matter at all..??

I dont believe anyone can be 'right' or 'wrong' as far as this goes. so.. ill assk instead: Am i missing 'it' here? Am I putting myself in my own social disadvantage about not caring about this identity issue? and if i dont care about yours - is that disrespect? (i feel it could be if that is what you held important to yourself, regardless of its value to me)

If i am ME can i ever BECOME ONE OF YOU? if i say or or feel it. yes or no. what makes it so..?

I would hate to feel differently then I do. so i sympathize with anyone who struggles with their own identity. and I want to advocate for it,. and 'you people' (i love saying that). but i dont understand. can you help me?

I wish i could help and just end peoples confusion by being able to say 'dont worry about it. youre you. name, pronoun, gender, completely inconsequential. youre you. b cool. stop trippin."" and that was it. but it doesnt work like that. why..??

2018-11-17 22:39:20,9y0qi7,4,1," Hi,

I  once asked on AVEN how non-binary vs. cis vs. trans people dreamed and  what their bodies look like in their dreams and there seems to be some  differences, I'm curious about you guys. I am unsure as to whether I am  non-binary, agender or female.

I   only learnt relatively recently that most people don't know they are   dreaming during their dreams but I always do and always have. It's not   the same as a lucid dream because I've had those, they are regular dreams but I can control my actions and the environment to a degree.

I   also dream of myself in 3rd person (I see my body in 3rd person like I   am watching myself in a movie). Occasionally I swap between 1st and  3rd  person at will.

Here are some questions, I will reply to them below:

1. Do you know you are dreaming during your dreams?
2. What   POV/perspective do you dream on? (first person, third person, other    persons POV, not present/ feels like watching a movie, alternate    between perspectives, etc...)
3. Do you feel any physical sensations in your dreams?
4. Are your dreams usually realistic or surreal?
5. Do you have ""super powers"" in your dreams? (ie flying, breathing underwater, invulnerability, etc...)
6. Is your dream body different from your real one? If so, how so?
7. Do    you have any dreams where you start out as yourself (or someone else)  then swap into someone else's body and see the body you were     before  through their eyes, then swap back again, and so on, and do you     ever see  sometimes both people at the same time in 3rd person? Do  you    alternate  between controlling either?
8. Do you control your actions in your dreams? Do you have any degree of control over your dreams?
9. How fast does time go by in your dreams? Is it like waking life, faster, or like a movie?
10. What is your sexual orientation and gender identity? (I think this manifests itself in dreams)

My answers:

1. I always know I am dreaming.
2. Usually   3rd person (I see myself from outside of my body while still    controlling it), sometimes 1st person, occasionally alternate, rarely I    am not present and I am just an observer and I remember having at  least   once ""possessed"" another person's body and controlled them.
3. No, I don't feel anything.
4. They are quite surreal.
5. Yes,   I can fly/float in the air sometimes, breathe underwater and I am    usually invulnerable. I can also rewind and change the future sometimes    and change the scene when the dream takes a turn I don't like.
6. Usually   my body is the same, but I dream of myself often in the body of  other   women, in a male body, in the body of some videogame character, as  a   fictional character or actor, some animal, etc... I often alternate  in   the same dream.
7. Not that I remember. When I swap bodies my body usually disappears.
8. I can control my actions fully, and the environment to a degree.
9. In   my dreams time seems to go by faster than normal. My dreams are  usually  long and lots of things happen. I can fill 2+ pages just with  keywords  when I wake up (I keep a dream journal and when I wake up I  just write  down the keywords to help me remember)
10. Female, hetero-romantic asexual. Possibly non-binary. Idk, still figuring myself out.

2018-11-19 08:16:44,9yevhg,14,1,"Hi all! I'm new here, and I'm hoping to find some perspective on pronouns and see if anyone feels the way I do. 

I hate that people use any pronouns to refer to me. I strongly prefer my name be used instead of a pronoun if possible, but that's a big ask. Here's why pronouns bother me so much. 

If someone uses ""she"" or ""he"":
Ugh, instant dysphoria. That's *wrong*. Just *viscerally wrong*. I'm *not that thing*. Great now I'm thinking about how and why that person thinks of me as being that gender, and falling down a dysphoric rabbit hole. Plz no. 

If someone uses ""they"":
Oh god I feel so guilty and self centered for asking for that. Did I ask for that? Did they just assume? Oh fuck what *is* this person's model of my gender? Do they think I want to be a they? Do they think I have a gender? Fuck, dysphoria. ""They"" as a pronoun Means Things now and isn't just a null value. Plz. Plz no. 

There's no right answer. I don't in any way begrudge anyone else their gender identity. I just wish it wasn't such a dominant paradigm that people expect *me* to have one. I **don't**. 

At some point I was asking people to use ""they,"" but I'm not sure any more. I never had a preference for it so much as a dispreference for being thought of as gendered in any capacity. I want to be able to just opt out of gender. To leave that field blank. I thought ""they"" would be a good null entry. 

But then I got more involved in the nb scene and found that many enbies *identify with* ""they."" This is great for them. They've found an option that works for them. I don't begrudge it at all. But it does make ""they"" no longer work for me. Because now it's an Identity too, which is what I was trying to avoid. The issue isn't with enbies identifying with ""they,"" it's that we don't actually have a null value pronoun. 

The thing that's causing the dysphoria isn't that the pronoun is wrong; they're all wrong. It's that it reminds me that this person, and all the other people I meet, have gendered models of me in their heads. To them, I'm *(insert gender here)* and that will always be wrong. I ultimately don't have much control over it, just like I don't have much control over my secondary sex characteristics, and that's horrifying to realize every time. 

Sometimes this makes me feel really out of place, and like I don't belong even with my nb friends. Like I don't fit in any of the boxes, not even the box for people who don't fit in boxes.

I thought ""they"" would be a good null entry. \n\nBut then I got more involved in the nb scene and found that many enbies *identify with* ""they."" This is great for them. They\'ve found an option that works for them. I don\'t begrudge it at all. But it does make ""they"" no longer work for me. Because now it\'s an Identity too, which is what I was trying to avoid. The issue isn\'t with enbies identifying with ""they,"" it\'s that we don\'t actually have a null value pronoun. \n\nThe thing that\'s causing the dysphoria isn\'t that the pronoun is wrong; they\'re all wrong. It\'s that it reminds me that this person, and all the other people I meet, have gendered models of me in their heads. To them, I\'m *(insert gender here)* and that will always be wrong. I ultimately don\'t have much control over it, just like I don\'t have much control over my secondary sex characteristics, and that\'s horrifying to realize every time. \n\nSometimes this makes me feel really out of place, and like I don\'t belong even with my nb friends. Like I don\'t fit in any of the boxes, not even the box for people who don\'t fit in boxes. Maybe I\'m not alone?

While this post deals mainly with issues of trans masculine nonbinary dysphoria, of course trans feminine and binary people offering support or ideas is more than welcome.


I'd also like to apologize in advance if I don't make much sense. I hav lots of trouble describing particular aspects of my dysphoria so I use metaphors a lot. I'm also really really struggling. 


~ ~ ~ ~ ~  ~


Ok so I'm here today because I'm really struggling with dysphoria and depression. So my situation is I am an afab genderfluid person with severe fluctuating dysphoria.


I'm just gonna describe my dysphoria a bit before moving on. So some days I am fine with no dysphoria, other days I have intense dysphoria and still some days I fall in between. Generally my dysphoria switches in larger.... Chunks of time? It's not a daily thing but more biweekly maybe, and it tends to be like an underlying dysphoria with really bad spurts. Think of like a low humming sound that sometimes increases in volume momentarily. I get dysphoria about everything from my chest to my jawline. I have ""phantom dick"" syndrome. I also get this really weird feeling when dysphoria suddenly intensifies.... It's like something inside of me is bursting through my core? Like imagine a spirit leaving your body (without the death). It feels like how one may imagine that would feel. Not corporal, but still there.  Sometimes my dysphoria leaves me nauseous, etc etc.



You may be saying well it sounds like testosterone is for you! However as a genderfluid person I am putting emphasis on dysphoric *fluctuations*. It follows that if I were to go on t, I'd have girl days still, and would therefore have a sort of reverse dysphoria. That's one issue with that. This leads into the next issue, which is of course I am still feminine as well so being on t and dressing and appearing feminine may be dangerous in some situations and I am afraid of being harmed.


This leads into my issues surrounding hate and bigotry. People barely get binary trans people, not to mention us nonbinary folks. Transphobia in general hurts and scares me. Then there is the nonbinary specific Transphobia which I have to deal with as well, from both within and outside of the trans community. The hate is present and seems to be growing. It's taking a big toll on me. I'm technically out, but I'm scared of being visible in any way. Right now I appear like a masculine girl I suppose, so I haven't had to say much about my gender outside of my small social circle. All of this, the dysphoria and the hate, has led me to despair


I will never be able to live my truth. Hatred is everywhere. Dysphoria is atypical and I can't deal with it anymore. I am tired of being viewed as a joke and I'm tired of feeling I will never be free of dysphoria. I am worried. I have found over the last two years that I'm experiencing something that may be some kind of dissociation : periodically it feels as if I am not in the physical world, that nothing is real. It randomly feels like my clothes go missing so I have to touch my legs to make sure my pants are still there. Sounds silly but it is very distressing. Sometimes i can't feel the ground, it's like I'm on clouds. I'm not sure if this is related to my dysphoria and depression but it may be. I feel like i am going crazy.


Yes I am on the waiting list to see therapists. It is just a waiting game now


So I'm asking for advice. Particularly from trans masculine people in similar situations, though all support helps. Also please hold off the hate comments and PM's. I had someone from here message me telling me to kill myself for being nonbinary. That didn't help at all.


Has anyone else experienced anything like this?


How do I deal with the hate?


How can I deal with dysphoria in non medical ways?


I'm becoming filled with despair and having many thoughts of just ending it all

I count myself very fortunate to have a small circle of trans friends who I can periodically meet up with for dinner and drinks, share some laughs and good conversation.  As a closeted person, it helps my mental state to get out and be with other transfolk even if it's just every now and again.

So this last time, there was a new girl-like-us who attended and she brought her wife, a cis woman, who was really fun to be around. God she was sooo much fun!  Very accepting, curious and inquisitive... in a respectful way and even became comfortable enough to playfully poke fun and joke with us.

Throughout the evening she gave me a number of compliments and coming from a cis girl, it just meant soooo much UNTIL....

&amp;#x200B;

the last one she gave after a couple of glasses of wine.  She kind of rolled up all her compliments in one breath... you know, saying how she really liked my outfit, it showed off my figure really well, my makeup looked good as did my hair and then...

""I mean you just look so....   just so nice and cute.  And except for your voice, which *totally*  gives it away, you pass pretty well. ""

God, I thought I was going to cry.  I mean like lower lip quivering, heaving-chest, mascara blurring, heavy tears right then and there.  It was all I could do to keep from crying.  Ugh...

I mean I KNOW my voice isn't great and I KNOW  because of my broad shoulders and facial structure I get read as a boy dressing as a girl but after getting all those nice compliments from her throughout the night and then to hear her say that...

&amp;#x200B;

it just really hurt. :(     I mean, I know I don't necessarily pass but can you all just... I don't know, tell me I look pretty and make me feel better.  Feeling really down still.  This is a pic from that night after I left for the evening.

2018-11-20 21:46:21,9ywq76,0,1,"Hi all, kind of just looking to get some perspective/advice.

I’m an AFAB and I’ve identified as a woman my whole life pretty much without question.  I recently came out to my family and some of my friends as bisexual. It’s been really great, I feel like I can finally be myself and coming out to them was definitely worth the initial anxiety over what might happen. 

Interestingly, one of the things I’ve felt has been the most freeing about coming out has been this feeling that I don’t have to conform to being a traditionally feminine woman anymore, I cut my long hair down to a short bob and I’ve been wearing more masculine or androgynous clothing and I feel really amazing doing so.  I went to conservative catholic schools all through K-12, and my parents would pressure me to dress “more feminine” when I wore things like Doc Martens and t-shirts, and I subsequently went through several hyper-feminine phases but I never really felt totally comfortable wearing things like short girly dresses, but I always thought it was because I wasn’t “finding the right color” or “finding the right fit for my body type”, etc rather than thinking maybe I just wasn’t comfortable dressing that way altogether.  

The fact allowing myself to deviate from traditionally female expectations has felt so good has made me question whether I was repressing a desire to do this for some time, and maybe whether this could be indicative of perhaps being somewhere in the realm of non-binary?  When I started thinking this, sometimes I feel like maybe I fit somewhere in between non-binary and being a woman.  Pretty much for the first time ever (I normally really like my T&amp;A lol) I was wearing a baggy shirt and kind of felt like I wanted smaller boobs or just flatness.  Lately I feel like I sometimes want to bounce back between non-binary and woman, but I’ve never felt this way before or questioned my gender prior to coming out, so it makes me feel more confused.  I’m not sure if it’s just because it’s the first time in my life I’ve dressed not traditionally feminine or if maybe I really do feel like I could have a different gender identity other than just woman. 

I know that gender expression is different than gender identity, but I’ve been wondering if maybe it isn’t so much the new clothes that feel great, but maybe wearing things that align more with how i might identify internally, but I start to get really confused when I think too much about it though because I think then we’ll gender is a social construct and there’s nothing inherently in our biology that dictates what clothes we should wear...etc. 

I guess I’m very early on this journey of figuring out what’s going on inside and learning more about myself, and I’m just wondering did anyone have similar experiences?  Is there a word for this feeling?  What did you learn as a result of your soul-searching?  Is it normal to not at all question your gender identity until learning what non-binary was? 

Thanks in advance everyone! 💜💚

TLDR: Not sure if I’m questioning my gender identity or simply gender expression since coming out as bisexual, looking for folks who had similar experiences or perspectives on what they ended up figuring out.

2018-11-20 22:00:35,9ywusu,4,1,"Rant time, bear with me. 

So I'm starting out on my social/non-medical transition and it's been rocky. 

I've always identified as being ambivalent towards gender. I just didn't care about what was for boys and what was for girls, I did what I wanted. That said, I've always presented very feminine and prefer to wear skirts (pants are evil). My main beef with my AFAB has always been 1. My uterus, i hate that thing so much 2. That my genitalia should determine how I act and feel. 

For the most part, I am comfortable with my sex (the physical characteristics) but my gender does not line up with that sex. I mostly blame a binaty culture for this. If I could be a female sexed person in an androgynous role within society (that everyone accepted and understood that my physical characteristics did not determine my internal gender), that would be my dream.

Now that I' taking steps to look more androgynous, I sat down with my husband to revisit my gender. We've been talking about it regularly to make sure we're on the same page. After talking through the above info he mentioned that he would support me through this but would always see me as a girl who wasn't a ""girl"". 

I honestly just don't know how to feel. Part of me is worried that I really am a girl playing at being agender. Another part of me wishes I was a sexless genderless being so I didn't have to deal with thia crap. The final part is worried that when I get where I'm going I'll realise all of this is a mistake and that I was being a fake all along.

2018-11-21 02:54:21,9yz7cl,2,1,"Sorry this one got a bit long but it’s been really weighing on my mind 

I’m maybe questioning and I wanted to compare to see if anyone else has had similar experiences? 

Recently my partner came out as nonbinary and transmasculine and my sudden weight gain from birth control around my boobs and hips has stirred up something in me that I’m not sure is real or not.

I feel conflicted in any desire to think about or explore a nonbinary identity because my mind always circles round to “What makes your feelings and experiences different than any other woman? When I think things like “well I don’t enjoy womanhood” or “it’s hard for me to feel like and relate to depictions of women in media”, it makes a little voice in my head say, do you really think that all dis and trans women have a mystical innate enjoyment of everything that goes along with being a girl? 

I don’t know if it’s possible to separate my gender feelings from misogyny feelings. I don’t know if sometimes existing in the way I do is uncomfortable because existing as a woman in current day society fucking sucks or I’m you know, perhaps not as much of a girl as I thought. 

Like there’s nothing that really defines being a woman and it can mean so many things to different people from different cultures and places so like my shtick might just be a part of that - stuff like hating shaving body hair, long hair, tight gauzy clothing, bras that show and cling to the shape of my new and dreadful D cups, like that is all stuff that a woman could also dislike.

I would also feel a lot of guilt if I stopped IDing as a woman because I’ve spent my whole life fighting to prove that women can be crush it in a STEM major, can crush it in comedy and don’t have to be feminine. I was happy identifying as a butch lesbian for the longest time because I thought it spoke to my experiences of alienation from my straight peers and what society expects women to act like and be. But my partner no longer identifies as a woman so it seems I doesn’t really fit the description anymore. Before them, I had boyfriend who was straight but I don’t know if I wasn’t really feeling our relationship because I dislike guys or because I dislike the idea of being a guy’s girlfriend and being treated as such. I love my partner no matter what, so it’s no big deal. But I don’t know what my own sexuality is apart from probably not cis men.

It’s complicated to me because I feel that if I said I was NB, I’d just be copying them to deal with the fact I can’t in good faith call myself a lesbian anymore. It feels somehow facetious to me to be like “Oh yes I am nonbinary, because I don’t fit extreme and ridiculous gender stereotypes about women but I will never tell that to other people because I am deeply scared.” I’d feel like such a faker and a phoney to compare my experiences to that of other members of the trans community I know who have had such a hard time in their inner and professional lives due to actual transphobia. I’ve been bullied for being not living up to expectations of women in my adult life, but I had a girlhood and teenhood that was pretty unscathed apart from internalized homophobia because I was so repressed that no-one, not even me, knew I was gay. And like I - did - have a childhood of a girl that was really impacted by sexism but also by growing up as a girl, so take that as you will. 

I keep having these thoughts that I wouldn’t judge anyone else by but for myself I’m like: 

The medical, social, and governmental hoops would make your personal and professional lives hell, so you’re better off staying where you are. You have no idea if this will make it better. 

People go to great extremes to be seen as their real, internal gender so if you are this hesitant about it, it probably isn’t real.

You are an extremely timid person who bursts into tears easily, if the world perceived you as a man other people would absolutely not tolerate you - you would be destroyed. 

My parents are already extremely unsupportive of me being gay, and I know they won’t “get it” Or respect me if I say I’m gender neutral. If I ever pursued biomedical transition (which I’m not sure if I want or not) they will flip out and have a extreme transphobia heart attack. As silly as it is, I love my parents deeply and look to their guidance and often their financial support and I don’t want to lose them when they’ve sacrificed so much for me. My extended family will not be supportive either.  I would just feel like an idiot if I said I was nonbinary but continued receive the benefits of being a tall, presumably cis, somewhat skinny white woman for my entire life. Like am I just feeling this way because I think I can get away with calling myself nonbinary because I am skinny and white and AFAB and that’s like the stereotype/poster child?

My now ever present boobs make me miserable and my weight gain makes me upset, and I feel like I wouldn’t mind being referred to by “they” and the gender neutral spelling of my current name and having a full breast reduction if I could pay for it and not let my parents know but I don’t really mind if strangers call me she as they don’t know better. It makes me more anxious when my fellow LGBT people seemingly put all these assumptions of me being a hundred percent a girl and not having complicated gender feelings of my own.

I’m not really looking for a definite answer saying that I’m valid but wanted to see if anyone ever felt similarly? If there’s any part of this that you’ve ever felt? It’s hard for me to understand any of my own internal thoughts because my childhood has taught me that the only things that are real are like, externally validated through the opinions of others - as horrible as this is, I’m still struggling with it.

So since I was 14 I have saved up for a binder, something that I knew I wouldn't wear all the time but just when I felt like I really needed to (because of the health implications), and in the summer I finally bought one and got the hang of it.

My issue is that I now feel super guilty because I've hardly worn it. I am having a really hard time with mental health issues at the moment, the kind where I'm lucky if I brush my teeth in the morning or get up on time. This means I've not been in the best of places to bind and make sure I'm doing it safely while also trying to feel good about myself. I feel like perhaps I have wasted money and a binder on myself because I've just never been strong enough yet in a day to properly commit. It helps my dysphoria when I'm having masc leaning days, but when I'm having those days and I'm also super depressed and not wanting to get up or put any effort in at all, it stays in the drawer, and I stay in bed, and everything feels even worse.

2018-11-24 05:59:14,9zw20i,1,1,"These are phrases said by my mother that run through my brain every time I feel distressed about being closeted and could possibly open up to her. Perhaps I should give a dysphoria warning? &lt;—- Here that is. 

“If someone is lgbtq they were born that way and we would know from an early age.” I’ve never felt like I could identify with any gender. From a young age, I would seek friends of “both genders” because it fulfilled what I felt I was comfortable with socially. As I got older, the usual things would be said about hanging out with “girls” and hanging out with “boys”. Especially to other kids at school, these things were assumed. Me being branded as a girl, if I hung out with the girls, I was just one of them and we did “girly” things and were told “you ____ like a girl”. If I hung out with the boys, I was probably doing something sneaky and bad with them or looking for attention. I never understood why I was being pulled this and that way, expected to act “like a girl”. Yes, I am physically female, but how should this dictate my social upbringing and the expectation of my achievments? I had a very delicate view of myself because I was so impressionable, and so many people were trying to tell me what I should be like, even if it wasn’t directly being said to me. Until I got to college and finally realized that gender really means nothing but what your body form is, I was molded into a scared being that made a lot of mistakes and made decisions in other peoples’ interests. 

I felt empathy for almost everyone I had ever talked to, and wanted to do everything I could to care for them. However, because I “was a girl/woman”, it showed to others that I could be looking for attention or was trying to go against how I was taught to act, or was giving too much of myself away. If I was a boy, I might not have been targeted by others as emotional or physical relief and therefore not extruded as someone with weak will. 

“You’re still a girl, right?” Once you started to realize I sympathized with lgbtq+ people and culture, you started to ask me things like this. It felt to me like you were trying to affirm that the way you viewed me was true. That if I had any ounce of thought in my brain that I may be lgbtq, I would tell you then. I didn’t feel safe. I didn’t tell you. This is a phrase that pops up in my mind almost every day. Whenever you talk to me about lgbtq+ issues and say how you feel about the invalidation of these people, I remember you saying this. You were showing me a closed door, and all I was prepared to do was walk past it and deny that I identified as anything other than female. Almost every time you see me, you talk to me about the latest lgbtq+ issue in the news or about your friends at work and how they deal with lgbtq+ topics. I’m sure it would be no problem now if I told you how I identified, but I am so afraid of these things that you have said to me that I can’t bring myself to talk to you about it. I feel like Nitinol, and any lgbtq+ related conversation with you is the heat. Shouldn’t it be the other way around? I am so scared. 

“Your boyfriend would be uncomfortable if you were lgbtq+, right, because he is a straight man?” You have said this to me when you were against lgbtq+ people, as well as when you began to be sympathetic to lgbtq+ issues and people. My identity is one thing and conversation that our relationship improves on every day, and he has assured me every time that he loves me no matter my identity. My identity is something that deals with my mental wellbeing and this is something especially important in relationships. He recognizes this and we grow more supportive of eachother every day because I am warming up and opening up to him more and more about it. I am getting stronger emotionally because we are able to have these conversations. 

“I raised my daughters with good hygiene, and for them to shave their legs and armpits.” Humans naturally grow hair. I would much rather be in a practice room practicing early before a class or going out to get coffee or see friends instead of using the time to complete an unnecessary task that does not matter to me. Having hairy legs is something I do not care about. Having hairy armpits is something that I do not care about. There are more and more important woman on red carpets with unshaven armpits and legs, and the only people that make big deals about it are making money off of it. I take care of myself, and have great hygiene. Hair removal has nothing to do with hygiene, and sometimes even has a negative effect on hygiene. My anxiety skyrockets every time I come home for a vacation and I have to make time for something that makes me emotionally sick and anxious because of how I have been treated in regard to when I don’t remove it. 

Since my best friends are nonbinary as well - “You always want to do what your friends are doing, so I can’t believe you.” Have you ever experienced something, and then realized that everything happening up until then makes sense because of it? Once I moved away from home and made friends with so many new people and heard so many more views of the world, discussions about gender identity stood out to me. It’s not sexuality, which can be defined by sexual attraction, it is how someone sees themself and believes others should see them in their fullest confidence. This stood out to me because it is one of the first things I have to think of for myself. I can talk about it with other people, but ultimately I have to decide what makes me feel happy and what makes me feel like my truest self. When I get rid of gender expectations and presumptions and assumptions, I see a whole new world where I can be who I want to be and thrive without all these things swirling around in my head, worrying me. 

“You don’t present very femininely but you still identify as a woman, right?” You saying this, and pointing out the parallel of how you present yourself, were not the best ways of trying to clarify, if that is what you were trying to do. Even though you now say every day that you would love your children no matter their identity/sexuality, I am so afraid to try to get through to you about myself because of all these fears cramming my thoughts. When I want to look at the “men’s” clothing section of Goodwill or any store, I don’t care that the clothes are designed for “men”. I want to wear things I am happy to wear and look like Me. I just want to look like Me. 

All these times, in order that I remember them going on in my life, I didn’t feel I could really say what I felt or even put together what I really wanted to say to you. I don’t hold anything against you and love you no matter what. I am just stuck with these words in my mind and I am afraid. 

There is no reason that the world should be driven by gender or anything that has to do with someone’s reproductive capabilities or bodily makeup. I personally can’t thrive any longer in an environment where I am confined by my own mind and what other people believe I should look or act like. Isn’t experiencing life to its fullest what it means to be human? I can’t keep the face on anymore, but I also can’t tell you, Mom, how I truly feel.

With the tape my chest was relatively flat. Flatter than I've seen it since childhood. It looked amazing and I felt so good. But it also made me much more aware of them since I felt them squeezed so tightly.
It was difficult breathing, which wasn't too bad. But it also pinched and stung.
I swear I used half of a 10 meter roll.
I'm seriously considering using bandages now, which everyone suggests against. But the tape can get expensive.
I just need to do something until I get top surgery, which might be next year or the year after.
Is it possible for dysphoria to get worse and worse? Because it feels like it is. It feels like I'm getting more dysphoria.

Potential Tw: Eating disorder
.
Coming to terms with this is making me realize that this is what my eating disorder has been all about this whole time. Trying to lose all the fat. Trying to look like a prebubescent boy.
.
It's really difficult. Especially since I'm married and feel like I'm being unfair? Trying to figure this out all alone is disturbing me and now I am feeling depressed again.
I've been depressed for 14 years and it feels like life keeps throwing me these curveballs. Just when all my medications got sorted and I started to live a normal life without depression... It's like now I'm thinking clear and starting to remember parts of my life. And I keep thinking back to when I was a child and for some reason thought that I would somehow grow up a boy. Which didn't happen.
I've just been struggling with this for years, and now that I don't have all of the other things to worry about.. I'm just alone with this. With this body and how I know it doesn't fit me and that I have no clue who or what I am.
Which takes me back to depression and eating disorders.
I'm on a merry-go-round of mental illnesses.

I have a senior project due for my college work, and I decided to draft a website that helps with all kinds of trans issues!

I  wanted to do a survey to get the community involved, and get their input on what they would like to see. This is an extremely quick survey  with no required questions. Every single response helps!

This community truly is the greatest, and I want to work on something that will give back to the trans community as a whole. I hope once I graduate, I can begin to work on this website as a pet project, and give the community a truly comprehensive and easy to understand site that they can use for themselves and to help others.

Since discovering there was something you might call a ""third option"" (however inaccurately), I've wondered if there might be small changes I can make to my presentation/performance—so that it lines up a bit more with the deep ambiguity/ambivalence I feel toward gender in general, and the mild-to-moderate distaste I feel for masculinity in particular.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, it may seem like a small thing, but I think it would be really fun to get a septum piercing. It's way out of my historical comfort zone, but that would be sort of the point. I've always been really shy about this stuff, but kinda tired of being in the closet.

2018-11-26 02:11:26,a0ezt0,6,1,"Hey everybody.
I'm afab and agender.
Been on T for just over a year now.

The longer I'm on T though, the more I start to get dysphoric from the changes.
I know I'm not cis, and I've known that since childhood, but it almost seems like my dysphoria is incurable and I don't know what to do.

I started T mostly with the intention of changing my voice, and maybe getting some face/body changes. So far, I've had one VERY minor voice drop and nothing else as far as any of those changes go. 
I knew to expect other changes though, and that I couldn't pick and choose them. Even so, I was willing to deal with things I didn't want to deal with severe voice dysphoria. I was always fairly hairy pre-T, and very content with the amount of body hair I had. I had a MAJOR increase in growth almost immediately, and after awhile, I had so much hair that it caused dysphoria, but if I shaved, I also got dysphoria. There's a brief window of time between shaving and full growth where I'm comfortable though. Facial hair? Started growing it by about 2 1/2 months, and usually have to shave daily now. Hate it. Huge source of- you guessed it, dysphoria. I was neutral on bottom growth until about 8 or 9 months in, and out of nowhere, I started hating it too. I'd be willing to accept all of these things if my voice would actually fucking change, but it won't. My T levels are comfortably in the male ranges but not too high, and have been since very early on, not to mention I believe I was told in the past that I have naturally high testosterone levelz for someone afab. It really seems like the only positive thing I got out of this whole mess was the end to my monthly cycle (I had one maybe 3 or 4 days after I started T, and that was the last one Ive had). Im desperate for my voice to change but everything else is making me miserable. I'm debating stopping in 6 months at my next appointment, but I really don't know what to do. I look and sound exactly like a somewhat hairier, acne covered version of my pre-T self and it's incredibly discouraging. 

Another issues is my chest and bottom dysphoria. I'm so poor and my efforts at crowdfunding have been pathetic, so I don't see myself reasonanly affording top surgery for another 3-5 years. My family is poor too, so there's no chance of someone else paying for it. 
My bottom dysphoria is a confusing and complicated beast on it's own. I absolutely cannot stand my natal junk, but the idea of having a dick is only slightly better. Both cause me massive amounts of dysphoria. Honestly of metoidioplasty and phalloplasty, phallo is the one that I'd be most comfortable with, but even it just feels so wrong to me. I'm never going to be happy unless I quite literally have no genitals, and I'm not entirely sure that's possible right now, or ever in my lifetime.

I'm afab and I have very long hair, like down to my waist. I have had both long and short hair and everything in between throughout my life. When I was little, my mom mostly kept it short and out of the way; I didn't care because I was a kid and considered myself a tomboy and stuff. I was 11 when I started caring and decided to grow it out. It was pretty long by the time I was 14, and decided I wanted to try something new and cut it very short. I remember immediately hating it and literally crying out of regret. I didn't cut it again til I was 18 and it was once again really long. 

This time, I cut it short more out of pressure to prove to my gf-at-the-time that I wasn't gonna be her perfect ""femme"" (long story). I was young and confused and actually at the start of questioning myself gender-wise. I think I remember having some regret but it must have not hit me as hard because after breaking up with the gf, I did let my hair grow some, but I also kept playing around with hair dye and ""scene"" hairstyles so I wasn't that invested in getting it long again. 

About a year after that, I was 20, I started learning about non-binary identities and started id'ing as such. I tried a few different short styles and was ok with them but it seemed like I could never achieve the androgynous look or styles I was going for. 

Eventually I did start wanting long hair again though. This was actually one of the things that caused me to stop id'ing as non-binary, I thought wanting long hair as an afab person meant I couldn't be valid as non-binary. People would always see me as a regular cis girl with long hair so why bother saying I'm anything else? 

I started letting my hair grow. I tucked away that part of me that felt like I could be nb (though my hair choices were certainly not the singular reason for this, there were others). That was a few years ago. My hair is now very long! I've been so happy about it... until now. 

I find myself feeling once again like I can't be valid as an afab nb person if I keep my hair this long. At first I was thinking that, who cares what anyone thinks, I'll keep my hair long if I want? But now I'm feeling the pressure again.. I don't think that's it either. Part of me does like short hair too and kinda misses it. I'm fond of certain ""a-line"" haircuts and I do think I looked kinda cute with certain short styles. But... I feel stuck because I also love my long hair and the thought of cutting it actually really scares me. I'm afraid of feeling immediate regret again and it taking another 3+ years to get it back. 

I'm not sure what to do. I'm thinking I should probably not do anything hasty and just leave my hair alone unless these feelings continue for 6+ months. It's just hard because as much as I love my long hair, I'm kinda resenting it right now because I need to feel validated. I'm also still kinda figuring this stuff out. I think I'm probably genderfluid and would actually love to present as a boy at times but how do I do that with my hair being this long? Do I just get a short wig? Or maybe cutting my hair short and getting some long wigs would be the better way to go. I'm not sure. I still want to be seen as a valid nb person even with long hair...

I'm white, and I identify with being nonbinary. I don't identify as a man or a woman, but I also don't feel like I am lacking gender.

I feel solid in my gender; I don't feel fluid at all, and I want to reflect that in the word I use to describe myself. 

I am a whole human being, I'm not missing anything, and so I don't like words that come from 0: neutral, gender non-conforming, or identifying solely as non-binary, because it's like describing the negative space- the things I'm not, rather than the things I am.

In recent years I began crossdressing (MtF) and that satisfied me for quite some time, and for a while I viewed myself as a male who simply had a crossdressing kink.

Now, however, I'm not so sure.  I'm turning 30 in a few months.  I would love to live at least into my 90s, and I've been thinking about my remaining time on this planet, and for me, time has been moving at an accelerated pace.  I'm thinking about what I want to do/accomplish/feel, and I realize that I really like being feminine and how I interact with people when I present as femme.  I don't consider myself a woman or transwoman, but I feel that ""male"" simply isn't an accurate representation of my being.  I don't hate my penis or other masculine features, but it's just ""meh"" to me - nothing exciting or interesting about it, and I wouldn't miss them if they were gone.  With this in mind, expressing myself exclusively as a male moving forward will be a case of me not being true to myself - being male is just what biology gave me in terms of anatomy, and my mind and soul can't really be categorized.  So that brings me to this space - we're only here on this planet once, and I'm feeling a more and more pressing urge to express who I truly am and want to be.

There's a select crowd of people in my life who know, but it's an isolated group - most, including my family, don't know.  I kind of want to come out at a slow pace, ease into it, slowly meet other NB people, but not make a big coming out ceremony just yet.  I still need to figure out if this is me, though from everything I'm seeing this is the best fit.  I do sometimes worry though because I've seen some non-binary people get made fun of or called ""special snowflakes"" or other mean names (especially in the more toxic parts of the Internet), but I've met a lot of NB people and I never thought they were doing it for attention - they are truly being themselves.  

This is a bit of a rant, but have to get it off my chest.  This has taken literally years to figure out but I'm finally glad things are starting to make a bit more sense in my head.

- How hard will it be to get a prescription if I walk in a doctor's office looking like a regular ""girl"" and saying I don't intend to present as male? Should I exaggerate the truth and say my dysphoria is worse than it really is?

2018-11-28 09:22:52,a14o0e,3,1,"Long post, sorry. English is not my first language, so please correct me if I use any wrong terminology!

&amp;#x200B;

The other day, my office had a trans-nonbinary person come in for a workplace sensitivity training type thing. Which was honestly pretty awesome and I'm glad they did. But one of the first exercise they did was go around the room and ask for people's pronouns. Immediately, I started panicking at the thought of having to identify my pronouns.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically at this point in my life, I don't know if I'm cis. I might end up being so, but I'm not comfortable labelling myself as such right now. I'm AFAB, almost always presented as femme-ish at work and in my social life, and it's more likely than not people will assume I'm a cis female. However, I've never been comfortable with... I guess, straight up labelling myself as female in front of others. It feels like I'm shutting out parts of me that I don't really know how to identify right now. I have usually worn feminine clothes, mostly because of size and availability (I'm 4'11 and tiny). I have no problem with people referring to me as she / her. But at the same time, during my teen years all I wore were boy's clothes, since it was an option before breasts and butts were a thing. I didn't mind it when people who didn't know me referred to me as he / him during that point in my life. I want a penis sometimes, but I also want to be able to keep my vagina / boobs (Think Ranma 1/2 if you're familiar with anime).

&amp;#x200B;

So basically, I really don't have a preference for what pronouns people use for me. It makes me a little happy when people accidentally refer to me as ""he/him"" or ""they/them"", mostly because I feel like a neglected part of me is getting recognized. But I don't feel dysphoric when people assume I'm female either. I'm not trying to be dismissive, but I just... don't care for gender.

&amp;#x200B;

But during this presentation, the thought of having to identify myself with a pronoun in front of my co-workers nearly gave me a full blown panic attack. Thankfully they didn't get to me and moved on with the presentation, but I was so scared. Later in the presentation, the presenter talked about how if you say you don't care about your pronouns, you're being dismissive of gender minorities, and you're likely relying on your privilege of being assumed to be a gender you are comfortable with. Which makes sense, but it made me want to disappear. 

&amp;#x200B;

So right now I just feel confused and crappy. Is it wrong that I didn't want to identify a pronoun? I just want people to choose what feels natural to them. Am I taking advantage of my privilege? Do I need to feel dysphoric to not be a cis person? I don't know what I am yet, but I'm scared that what feels natural to me is hurtful and offensive to many.

2018-11-29 11:27:22,a1gjfo,11,1,"I’m a butch/androgynous bi woman and I’ve been questioning for a couple of months now. In my early 20s (I’m now 26) I considered myself very feminine, had long hair and wore these amazing 50s style swing dresses which was a lot of fun (you get so many random compliments if you wear a big poofy dress with underskirt out in public).

Over the past few years I’ve phased makeup out of my routine and started dressing for comfort and to express my queerness. I’m in a happy LTR with a straight guy who loves me and affirms my sexuality, but I often feel erased by outside parties when not actively dating or seeking women. I leaned hard into the short hair/plaid shirts/singular earring aesthetic and experienced what I can only describe as gender euphoria for the first time.

...Which leads on to my first major DYSphoric experience. I had to find an outfit for a friend’s “summer” wedding on limited time and budget. I don’t know shit all about fashion or formal wear and needed something smart but seasonally appropriate that also wasn’t too feminine. The stress of outfit hunting and the invalidation in going around women’s clothing stores and finding only clothes that were too delicate and femme for my presentation and (broad, plus size) bodytype threw me into a gender panic. I had a mini-melt down at work where I suddenly felt intensely like my gender was wrong, that everyone else’s perception of my gender was wrong...I felt physically light headed and queasy, it was like being hit with a bat.

Since then I’ve noticed a torrent of little things like the fact that I don’t mind family and close friends viewing me as female, but I feel deeply uncomfortable when people I come into contact with through my work, or store assistants in other businesses etc “assume” my gender and “treat me like a woman”. I’ve asked for male uniform items at work and feel I’m more comfortable, and I feel invalidated when I share selfies only for friends to make comments about me being “pretty”. (They’re only being nice, but I feel like I’ m fairly visibly trying to present masculinely so it feels like they’re forcing themselves to say it because “surely it’s what girls want to hear”).

I don’t really know what I’m meant to be feeling or looking for. I might just be a masculine-of-centre cis woman whose dysphoria comes not from any discomfort with being female, but from society expecting me to look/feel/be a certain way because of that. Or I could be enby, but it’s so hard as a female queer woman to separate what signs are my soul trying to tell me “this is the shape of my gender” and what’s just society/my conditioning trying to force something different on me than what I am.

This entire post is a mess but I guess that’s accurate to where my head’s at right now... If this is too big a mess to pick through I guess I have some more straightforward questions:

1) Can you be Enby and still favour the pronouns you’ve known your whole life? I’ve experimented a little with “they” but “she” feels most personal to me despite the fact I don’t like being “treated” as female.

2) What were your personal journeys like when it came to untangling your identity?

The survey will take about 5 minutes and the information you provide will be completely anonymised and collated with others to get an accurate representation of how the fashion industry can approach gender categorisation in the future.

My biggest source of dysphoria is my body. I have really large breasts, lose tummy skin and stretch marks from pregnancy. I gave birth almost two years ago. No matter how much I exercise I can’t get my stomach to go away. Looking in the mirror has been really painful lately.

I’m still not sure if hormones are the right path for me, because I don’t think I want my voice to change or deal with body hair. I know we don’t get to “pick and choose,” but I do wonder if T would help with the fat distribution from my curves. It will be a long while before I can make that decision. 

I live in a state with informed consent, and have Kaiser Permanete. Their gender health program is supposed to be pretty great, but I am wondering to what extent they are willing to help. I know I could get a breast reduction covered, but do you think they would cover something like a tummy tuck? Or would they view that as not “necessary”? To what extent would I have to go to show how significantly my stomach exacerbates my dysphoria? 

I feel grateful to have had the opportunity to carry my daughter, and my partner is MTF and is the most supportive. But I have this parent-guilt of being deeply ashamed of my body...  

Just wondering if any fellow AFAB have dealt with anything like this, and if they have experience with insurance covering/not covering surgeries.
