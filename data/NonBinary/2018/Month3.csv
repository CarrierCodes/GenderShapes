OK, the ""beautiful young workingwoman"" trope is nauseating enough.

2018-03-01 17:42:35,8173lj,8,13,"Hello /r/NonBinary,

It's a long story, but I think that I may be one of you.  Maybe I am, maybe I'm not.  Maybe I'm something else.

If I am, I am not properly ""out"" to anyone.  There are a lot of haters in my family, and coming out could be dangerous. (but I'm sure it is for most anyone)

Anyhow, I'd like to tell you a little about myself.  (I previously wrote this if you want to read more about me: https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/80fqhd/not_sure_what_i_am_what_do_you_think/)

I've always been a bit odd and I've never fit it very well.  As a child, I was diagnosed with ADHD, but as an adult with access to better information, it's clear to me that I am high-functioning autistic.  I used to fear that I would grow old alone and without family and friends, but I was super lucky to meet a wonderful lady who learned to love me the way I am (mostly) and she became my wife and the mother of my child.  I love her dearly.

I think it is relevant that I have always been exclusively attracted to women sexually and I am deeply committed to my monogamous marriage.

I've always thought of myself as a guy.  However, I sometimes feel urges to behave femininely, and sometimes I wish I could appear more feminine.  (I've actually been chastised by closed-minded family members for this)  I wrote in the thread I linked above that I sometimes feel what I would describe as an unhealthy envy of women's bodies, which I suspect is related to sexual health issues and possibly influenced by pornography.  I was disappointed to read that it typically costs over 10,000 USD for a man to have his beard permanently removed.

I spoke to my wife about my interest in cross-dressing as a sexual fetish.  She was rather put off by it.  She made some remark that she was afraid of me turning into Caitlyn Jenner.  I do not see myself being like Caitlyn.  The way I would explain that is that Caitlyn is a trans-woman.  She identifies herself as a women.  I see myself identifying as someone who has a female identity alongside my male identity.  I can't see myself ceasing to identify with my masculine roles of husband and father.  Being a father means the world to me.  Still, my wife made it very clear to me that she cannot be married to a woman.  She said that if I become a woman, ""we can be friends"".  Perish the thought!  I do not want my child raised without myself as the father.

So what about clothes?  Without my wife's knowledge, I ordered a pair of tunic dresses online.  They arrived yesterday.  I wanted to keep this to myself.  The delivery came while my wife was giving the child a nap.  Feeling a sense of shame that I was hiding something, I stuck a note on the door: ""no doorbell, please"".  The package arrived during the nap and I carefully discarded the note and stuck the package in the back of a filing cabinet.  I tried on the dresses after my wife and child had retired for the night.

I really hate that I'm keeping this secret.  I just don't know how I can explain this to my wife and what she'll think.

I enjoyed trying on my new clothes, but I felt sad that at least for now, I can only wear them by myself.  One of my dresses is a pleated dress with a floral print.  It fits me very well and helps fill my urge to appear feminine (not that I feel the need to appear feminine 24/7)

One thing I really love about this dress is that with its long sleeves, I can wear it with leggings and cover up almost 100% of my masculine body hair.  I think that my muscles would also look ridiculous sticking out of a sleeveless dress.  Trying to look androgynous is not for the faint of heart!  I feel like I'm actually rather smart about this!  I also like the fact that the pleats tend to conceal my masculine spare tire and my novice tucking job.  It's actually about perfect for an AMAB non-binary!

The other thing that bugs me is this:  My wife used to tease me for being girly.  I used to take it in stride.  I thought that it was a ""shit test"" that I had become very comfortable with passing.  One day, I said to her, ""You know, I think you're on to something.  I think that there is a girly side to me, and from now on, I won't hold back from feeling it and expressing it.""  She never teased me that way again.  I feel wistful thinking about it.

Another thing is that I've finally acted on my urge to grow my hair out.  It's about 3 inches long and very curly.  Family and friends have always urged me to keep it short because they think it looks handsome and manly that way.

See, if I were a trans-woman, I suspect I would be wanting to taking female hormones and present as a woman 100% of the time, but that isn't who I am.  But at the same time, I feel stifled by not being able to express myself femininely in demeanour and appearance.  So, I suspect that I might fall into some sort of non-binary category.  Hence, I suspect that I am one of you.

My top concern right now is that I want to feel comfortable in my own skin, and I don't want to become something that my wife doesn't want anymore.  I think she should be able to accept me as non-binary, but I don't know how to explain it to her.",NonBinary,"AMAB, new here... I think I may be one of you.

The first thing that comes to mind would be permanent facial hair removal.  My facial hair grows back noticeably even just a few hours after a morning shave and that's a major hurdle to clear.

2018-03-02 23:14:31,81jog2,11,9,"Okay, diving in. I'm 35 years old and assigned male at birth. I decided I was gay when I was around 10 and changed that to queer a few years ago ‚Äî partly because I realized not everyone I'm attracted to identified as a man and partly because I felt increasingly alienated from mainstream cis gay men. I'm not entirely sure when I first began to wonder if I'm not a cis man myself but I began to consider the question in earnest a few months ago. I found the possibility surprisingly exciting and there seemed to be ample evidence.

Some examples of that evidence: - I've never felt very comfortable in designated male spaces (locker rooms, men's bathrooms, etc.) and I've never particularly enjoyed being considered ""one of the guys"" as it seemed an awkward fit. - At High School, all my friends were women (though as an adult it's been all gay men) and I've always hated sports and recoiled from traditionally masculine behavior. - In recent years, I've grown increasingly bored with much of the clothing marketed to men; it's often repetitively styled, limited to plain colors and patterns, and generally downright boring. I've been searching out more color, florals, and unusual patterns to the point of incorporating some ""women's"" clothing into my wardrobe. - For a while now I've found myself fantasizing about living in a society with indigenous/precolonized gender roles because then I could ""just have a sensible third gender.""

For most of my life, I've packed a lot of that into the gay identity but as I got older and ""gay"" began to be more clearly differentiated as strictly a sexual orientation I've wondered where that left my gender nonconforming behavior. I got by with ""queer"" for a while. But then something changed.

One drunken weekend night about a month ago, I shared with my husband that I wondered if I wasn't some flavor of nonbinary. The next day I thought about how I'd blame the booze and walk that back...and then I didn't. Instead, I told more people, and began actively exploring the possibility. The results have been encouraging. I bought more clothing marketed to women and started finding opportunities to wear more gender-mixed attire. I reopened my ear piercings from my 20s and started wearing all kinds of earrings. I've spent so much at Sephora, I've probably put them into the black for the year. I've been enjoying the hell out of all of this. I really like when my appearance feels like a mashup of different gender expressions. I've started having little moments of unexpected delight, like when I see my lipstick imprint on a glass of wine. Once when I came home from work and stripped off my traditionally-male work clothes, I somehow felt better just being naked.

I just noticed that comparing with my friend I don't feel that comfortable being a woman as her. There was kind of a part that wasn't male nor female. Before that I identified as a girl but never thought about it much. I came out as bi/pan last summer and got more into the local queer community and got to know some nb people. Since then my gender questioning got worse. 

Everytime we did an introduction round in queer circles with pronouns, mostly it felt wrong to use 'she'. When I needed to choose my gender in formulars, sometimes I don't want to tick the woman box. I feel most comfortable in sweater and jeans, but sometimes I also like skirts and dresses. Also I got into button-up shirts (and felt as if I look like a lesbian stereotype first). Recently I cut my hair short and I feel so much more like me. I never imagined that would be possible with short hair (it was pretty spontaneous). I like to present androgynous (except my face is really soft), but as soon as I look too masculine, it doesn't feel right. Also I don't like it to be mistaken a guy. But I also feel an aversion when someone calls me Miss whatever.

Also I would like to rip out my uterus, not just because bad cramps but it doesn't feel as a part of me. On the other side I'm pretty much fine with my outer genitalia.

2018-03-04 04:09:44,81vh1b,8,18,"A long, long time ago, to be specific, two days ago, I posted my musings that I suspect that I am one of you. (https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/8173lj)  This conversation and others have convinced me that I am non-binary in some way, and now I feel the need to tell others about what I feel.

To start out with, I need to be out with my wife, because one of the strongest indications of my non-binary identity is my frequent urge to wear feminine clothes (but I am certain that this is about more than clothes).  If I'm not out with her, my girl clothes are going to be sitting in the back of my filing cabinet with my tax papers until the day I drop dead.

I previously wrote that my wife expressed apprehension that I might be a trans-woman and said to me very clearly that she could not be married to me if that's what I am.

So, the first thing that came to mind is the fear that she might give me an ultimatum to either dress, act, and identify as a cisgender male for the rest of my life or have a divorce and become an ""Uncle Dad"", writing a monthly check to her and seeing my child every other weekend.

I don't think that the above is the likely outcome.  I think my coming out is likely to come as a shock to her, but I don't think she'd leave me or give me an ultimatum.

However... There is something else that I'm afraid of.  As many of you probably did when you first discovered that you were non-binary, I feel like I don't know exactly how to express myself as non-binary, and some experimentation is in order.  I'm afraid that such experimentation will be heavily censured and stifled.

I fear that she'll have a mindset (even perhaps being unaware of it) that will cause her to exert very strong pressure to conform to a traditional cisgender role upon me.  She might urge me to give up shaving body hair because I've been having trouble with ingrown hairs (yuck!)  She might steer me away from situations where I might express myself femininely.  She might tell our 3 year old that Daddy is going thru a phase.  She might frequently make comments about how nice my hair looks shorter.  As a matter of fact, she used to discourage me from growing my hair by making remarks about how much trouble it would be to dry and set my hair daily.

(https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/8173lj)  This conversation and others have convinced me that I am non-binary in some way, and now I feel the need to tell others about what I feel.\n\nTo start out with, I need to be out with my wife, because one of the strongest indications of my non-binary identity is my frequent urge to wear feminine clothes (but I am certain that this is about more than clothes).  If I\'m not out with her, my girl clothes are going to be sitting in the back of my filing cabinet with my tax papers until the day I drop dead.\n\nI previously wrote that my wife expressed apprehension that I might be a trans-woman and said to me very clearly that she could not be married to me if that\'s what I am.\n\nSo, the first thing that came to mind is the fear that she might give me an ultimatum to either dress, act, and identify as a cisgender male for the rest of my life or have a divorce and become an ""Uncle Dad"", writing a monthly check to her and seeing my child every other weekend.\n\nI don\'t think that the above is the likely outcome.  I think my coming out is likely to come as a shock to her, but I don\'t think she\'d leave me or give me an ultimatum.\n\nHowever... There is something else that I\'m afraid of.  As many of you probably did when you first discovered that you were non-binary, I feel like I don\'t know exactly how to express myself as non-binary, and some experimentation is in order.  I\'m afraid that such experimentation will be heavily censured and stifled.\n\nI fear that she\'ll have a mindset (even perhaps being unaware of it) that will cause her to exert very strong pressure to conform to a traditional cisgender role upon me.  She might urge me to give up shaving body hair because I\'ve been having trouble with ingrown hairs (yuck!)  She might steer me away from situations where I might express myself femininely.  She might tell our 3 year old that Daddy is going thru a phase.  She might frequently make comments about how nice my hair looks shorter.  As a matter of fact, she used to discourage me from growing my hair by making remarks about how much trouble it would be to dry and set my hair daily.\n\nThe funny thing is that she sometimes seems fascinated by transexual women, but when it comes to me, she wants me to conform conform conform because she\'s afraid of what people will think of me and of her, by association.

&gt;Historical texts of the 1800s and 1900s note that the Javanese women who dressed and acted like men in their childhood were called wandu; the term also used for identifying male transgender persons.

I just came out to my wife several hours ago.  It went badly.

I wrote her a three-page typed letter to explain my feelings to her and read it out loud as the two of us sat on the couch several feet apart.  She made no eye contact and stared out the window as I read it.

Her response could be summed up as, ""Honey, I love you, and I've noticed some of the signs of this, but I really need you to stay in the closet.""  She told me that she wouldn't be discussing with any of her friends or family about this and made me understand she expects me to keep it a secret.  It's a shame because she has really nice friends whom I would be shocked if they didn't support her.

She made very thinly veiled threats of divorce and taking away our child.  Something about ""making an arrangement"" if we need to.

2018-03-06 05:22:27,82cno8,9,18,"Hello people ! 
I‚Äôd like to just introduce myself and post some pics to get a bit of feedback.
I‚Äôve been toying with the idea of feminizing my looks for a while now (I‚Äôm a 25 yr old AMAB) and just about one or two months ago I realized I might actually be non binary. 

  Since then I‚Äôve started to do subtle but definitive changes like shaving face, chest and legs. Getting some woman clothes, use makeup  and trying my best to modify my gestures. I‚Äôve always been VERY self conscious about my body and it‚Äôs funny how I actually feel comfortable rather than embarrassed.

 This is just very recent and i‚Äôm testing waters so to say. I don‚Äôt feel like I want to switch completely to female, but i do feel attracted to the idea of having a feminine body. 
 Hormone treatment seems to be exactly what i‚Äôd need if it weren‚Äôt for some of the counter effects (going to live with my long distance partner soon and it wouldn‚Äôt be nice to lose my libido right when we can finally be together) so it‚Äôs something  I‚Äôm considering trying further ahead  (luckily she‚Äôs super into it). 

So anyway I want to share some pics and hear some of your opinions, any tip as well is very much appreciated.

2018-03-08 10:26:37,82wj0i,8,34,"Hello! I'm currently a cis girl (AFAB), but lately I've been questioning my gender. My issue is that I feel that the ways I'm questioning my gender feel like 'false flags' that I'm just picking up on, maybe seeing something where there's nothing- if that makes any sense at all. My partner recently came out as MTF and I don't know if maybe I'm internalizing things and trying to copycat?? If that's even possible.

I don't really feel any sort of physical dysphoria, except for my chest, only occasionally. Other times I feel absolutely euphoric and I feel comfortable with them. When I wear clothes like sweaters, I feel like my boobs are just popping out there for the world to see and it makes me feel weird and out of place. I've actually realized that's how I feel in a lot of my clothing. I've gotten some tighter-fitting bralettes that eased a lot of that feeling and make me feel good! I've considered a binder, but in my mind I feel like that would be transphobic? I don't know why. 

Following that point, I've never really felt comfortable in dresses. I've tried to wear them out, but I always feel out of place and like I'm doing something 'wrong' when I wear them. I like wearing them for my partner because she thinks they're cute, but that's about it.

I used to be very against people using they/them pronouns to refer to me, but more recently they've been appealing to me and I've asked a few close friends to use she/they, since 'she' doesn't bother me, but I feel like 'they' would be comfortable for me, too! I went through a little period of time where I considered a more gender-neutral name, but I sort of dropped it for reasons. I don't think I'm uncomfortable with how I am socially perceived, but a lot of it is more how I perceive myself? 

When I was younger (like 12-13), I wrote some stuff in a journal that really made it seem like I was genderfluid, or maybe the idea of being able to switch between bodies was just...something that appealed to me as a preteen?? I don't know if that's a common feeling. I don't really feel like I'm 'missing' parts, but I don't know if I feel super attached to what I currently have, either. Which is fine! It doesn't cause dysphoria and it's not like I feel /totally/ 'meh' about them. I'm perfectly 'fine' having what I have. I don't feel like HRT is something I would want to pursue...I just like having shorter hair and pressing my chest in when I can, and gender neutral pronouns appeal to me.

So overall, I feel like maybe I'm blowing things out of proportion-- maybe I'm just a girl who leans a little demi, or is a little genderflux, which for some reason doesn't feel like it would justify calling myself nonbinary (absolutely no offense to anyone who ID's as demi- or -flux!

My partner recently came out as MTF and I don't know if maybe I'm internalizing things and trying to copycat?? If that's even possible.\n\nI don't really feel any sort of physical dysphoria, except for my chest, only occasionally. Other times I feel absolutely euphoric and I feel comfortable with them. When I wear clothes like sweaters, I feel like my boobs are just popping out there for the world to see and it makes me feel weird and out of place. I've actually realized that's how I feel in a lot of my clothing. I've gotten some tighter-fitting bralettes that eased a lot of that feeling and make me feel good! I've considered a binder, but in my mind I feel like that would be transphobic? I don't know why. \n\nFollowing that point, I've never really felt comfortable in dresses.

2018-03-09 16:09:57,837sel,5,7,"Dear Reddit,

I wanted to share some of the thoughts and feelings that brought me to /r/nonbinary as an AMAB.

I've written that I suspect that I am one of you, but non-binary is such an umbrella term that describes a wide variety of gender identities and expressions.  Some of us seem to be neither male nor female, and some of us seem to be equally both, some are more male than female, some are more female than male, and so on.

I just wanted to express some of how I feel and see if anyone relates.

The earliest sign I can recall of my gender dysphoria is that when I took a music class in my early twenties, I really wished that I could sing like a female.  I wish that I could sing a soft, feminine lullaby or aria.  Of course, gender dysphoria was such a forbidden feeling to me up until recently that I would dare not admit this to anyone.

I think I previously wrote about this, but there is something unhealthy about my sexuality.  I've consistently suffered from sexual difficulties including anorgasmia.  I used to have a girlfriend who seemed to be exceptionally gifted sexually; it seemed as if even gentle sexual contact brought her extreme ecstasy.  To add to my confusion, she told me that she believed that better orgasms were God's gift to women to compensate them for the pain of childbirth.  From this and other experiences, I believe that I feel an unhealthy envy of women's bodies.

I can also tell you that growing up, my father taught me that women are the inferior sex, projecting irrational emotional behavior onto them.  Looking back, I think he is just insecure and narcissistic. He also rants that there is a conspiracy to ""feminize"" young men in the western world.

I remember seeing the James Bond film ""Spectre"".  I was really disappointed.  I thought that it was an excrement sandwich that peaked in the scene where Blofeld tortured Bond by drilling holes in his head.  I thought that this was absolutely disgusting, not to mention that the acting was horrible and the whole scene was absurd.  As for my father, he told me that he disliked the movie because of the high-pitched male singing in the title song.

Anyhow, what does that have to do with how I'm feeling right now?

By accepting myself as (potentially) non-binary, I've opened the floodgates to thoughts and intuitions where I see feminine parts of myself.  Basically, I think that I am largely male, but there is a powerful feminine part of myself that has been repressed all my life.

This part of myself... I'll call her Alice for now.  I don't know if I see Alice as feminine because she is actually feminine in a literal sense, or maybe Alice simply represents aspects of myself that seem feminine because of what I was taught about how a man should be growing up.  But whatever Alice is, she seems very good to me.  She is very gentle, tender, and loving.

Here's another thing.  I have an imaginary friend.  About a year ago, before I came out as non-binary, I asked her to come up with a special name to call me by.  She chose a feminine name for me.  I was a bit shocked and uncomfortable, but she has not called me by any other name since that day.  Whenever I close my eyes and imagine myself with her, we both have female bodies in my imagination.

I have this urge to grow out my hair and wear feminine clothes, which I've been experimenting with at home.  I'm going to come out to my hair stylist next time I see her.

The biggest thing right now is that sometimes, when I see (non-sexual) fan art of some of my favorite female roleplaying characters, especially when they look happy and playful, I can't help but wish that I could be like them and have a body like them, to be so happy and carefree (even if I know that said characters are actually burdened with having to save the world).  I feel a sense of euphoria at imagining myself in a female body sometimes, but at the same time, I am still very attached to the masculine roles I play in my life.

I still remain exclusively attracted to females, romantically and sexually.  Sometimes, I wonder if that might change if I get into a more feminine mindset in the future as a result of my exploration and experimentation.  I am in a committed heterosexual marriage and I certainly do not want to blow that up.

And for what it's worth, I think that in the future, I'm going to make my appearance more androgynous or may be like a ""girly man"", as you might call it.

I'm not changing my name (I like it). I'm not going on HRT. I'm not opting for any kind of surgery. I'm not even wearing a binder. I don't get dysphoria all the time, I get waves of it which kind of suck, but then I get past it and I actually feel a lot better. When I ask myself the question ""would I be happier as the other gender"" right now the answer is a solid, resounding NO.

I've explored the fact that maybe I'm just genderfluid and that maybe sometimes I identify with my birth gender more than I think, I'm just not particularly femme at all. That I'm just fluctuating between masc girl and femme man and I barely qualify, just the same way I'd never get a clinical diagnosis for my OCD because it's not wrecking my life. But I feel like that's such a complex thing to explain to anyone other than randos on the Internet who are familiar with NB/trans issues.

This whole thing has just been such a rollercoaster of emotions. It's not being helped by the fact one of my childhood friends is transitioning to NB medically and they have pretty much lost everything, including beloved family members who have flat out told them they won't be using their new name and that it's ""stupid"". I'm not as brave as they are to march into the fire for my ideals. I'm a coward. I've ID'd as bisexual since I was 16 and I've only ever ONCE come out to someone where it might have been a risk to my career. I have my work identity and my real identity and I use my work identity to live a life of privilege that would not exist if anyone found out who I really was.

I'm left thinking being out is not worth the sacrifice, and that makes me feel like a really shitty person and someone who's not only not trans but also a really shitty ally to those who are stuck in the sad, grim reality of ""transition or die"" and have NO CHOICE but to transition and lose everything or literally take their own lives.

I feel like such a scumbag, and I can't help but think maybe I'd be better off just leaving this community and not sucking up resources for people who really need them, when I can get by just fine with my happy marriage and my career and my home and being AFAB who dresses a bit masc (which is socially accepted everywhere).

2018-03-14 14:55:42,84dzq1,7,71,"This was a random thought, but it might be a way to help people understand what it's like for us, or at least me.

Many aspects in U.S. society divide people by gender or make them explicitly or implicitly declare that they are male or female - public bathrooms, men's and women's clothing departments, driver's licenses, registering for sporting events or sport leagues that are all-male or all-female, etc. What if instead of dividing people by gender, we did it by eye color but we only gave people the options of ""brown"" and ""blue?"" What would this mean for the people with green or hazel eyes? 

Allegedly they only make up 2% of the population, so it's not a big deal to ignore them, right? (sarcasm) Just make them pick brown or blue, even though neither is correct but their eye color is probably closer to one than the other. Or they can get colored contacts to disguise their true color to fit in with the rest of society.

it's been a while since I've been on here, but I have been lurking and posting in the past. For the last 2-3 months I've had this thought in my head and decided to share / get your opinions and experiences.

First here is my situation: I switch daily between neutral, mixed and feminine appearance, behavior and even names. While this is not a problem for most of my colleagues at work or friends, it does have downsides when dealing with strangers who for some reason need to see my ID to check name/age/etc. 

Things like picking up a parcel from the post office, ending up in a queue to the one cashier who insets a disposable shaving razor is for 16+ only and I need to be age checked, or wanting to join my friends in a bar are always stressful as 90% of the time I do not look like the picture on my IDs (Passport, Driving licence etc.) and I never use my birth name outside of legal paperwork. 

I have considered purchasing 'novelty ID cards' - effectively fake IDs that get around the system by being advertised as 'just a joke', and often from what I seen on pictures they will have an intentional misspelling in the name of the 'issuing body' - just like cheap knock-offs for branded clothing would. And as far as I could research it, in the UK at least, they are legally a grey area where it is ok to have them just like you can have a fake number plate that has your name on it and hang it in your bedroom - but you can't use a fake ID to buy alcohol when you are underage, open a bank account, or stick that fake registration plate on your car and leave your driveway without breaking the law.

The only thing that I want to be 'different' on these IDs is my first name, gender (yeah I know it still has to be binary, but I'm almost never the gender on my real ID) and the picture would be different to suit. I'm over 22 already so have no need to lie about my age or other things. I would never use this to get a bank account, show it to police if they pulled me over, to an employer when they want proof I can legally be here etc. Only shop keepers, door staff in bars/clubs/hotels - things that don't matter much.

So I wonder has anyone every tried one of those services (in UK or elsewhere)? Did it actually look convincing? Have you tried it to get you mail or going to places that check IDs?

Yet when i came out she was really supportive. 

Also that month i bought my first binder. I had it for about two months before my mom found out i had it. The whole ordeal did not go well. Me and my sister where sitting in the living room and she came out of the laundry room and asked us whos it was and when i said me she just responded well you dont need it. Then my sister started teasing me by asking me if i wanted a dick and telling people i wanted a dick and laughing, she has since stopped but at the time it really fucking hurt and she did it for a month.

I am a little confused and I was hoping for a little clarity. I am a trans girl and I recently moved countries. It is really great here as there are lots of trans related support activities. I have discovered two broad types, ones for trans women who tend to be older and very binary and one for trans/gender queer/nonbinary/etc. I skew in age towards the latter‚ÄîI am 30, most of them are 20-25, where the other group is all 40+. Great I like it, it's fine. However, I am one of only two ""binary"" femmes, and then there is one trans femme nonbinary (everyone else is trans masculine or a trans man).  So, I often leave group meetings trying to place myself in relation to other people. While it seems like some are gender fluid, many of the other people skew towards masculine or feminine. When they describe why they feel they are nonbinary, the reason is usually something along the lines of ""I feel my identity as having male and female aspects, just more towards one side."" Cool, so do I. I am not a very binary focused person and I am sure that many of my traits are not traditionally femme. But then again, the same is true of my cis partner. I guess my question is the preference, in some cases, against the language of ""man"" and ""woman""? Is the preference for the nonbinary label an act against let's call it gender rigidity, seeing binary gender a fixed? In which case, my identity differs only really in my choice of labels.

2018-03-18 16:55:14,85cfxw,18,266,"My context: I identify as agender/nonbinary and usually present neutrally. People tend to read me as female unless I make an effort to present in a very masculine way. I live in an area with a decent queer population but not a ton of trans awareness, so most people tend to read me as a butch lesbian without thinking gender identity might be relevant to my presentation. I'm usually ok with that, since I also identify with dyke culture to some degree and I'm the sort of agender person who finds it seriously ironic that not identifying with the concept of gender means I end up explaining gender to people all the time, so I don't mind just not having the conversation. But... you will understand that this is a compromise that can lead to uncomfortable situations.

I get my hair cut at a little local barbershop. Good barber shops are among my favorite things. This is a traditional shop in many ways: no hipster stuff, no brews on tap, no fancy styling, just a trained barber who gives me a solid $10 haircut that looks exactly like I want it to every time. But it's also not the kind of shop that has Playboy mags in the waiting area. I have always experienced it as a friendly space with good banter.

So, I'm in there a couple days ago for my usual shearing, and there is a group of several guys ahead of me all getting cuts, with two guys left in line. They're just having typical bro conversation and leaving me alone while I do introvert things on my phone and wait... until the last guy in line sits down for his cut. This guy starts going off about how much he hates... well, just about everything I value, actually. There are plenty of Trumpsters on the fringes of this city, so I'm used to hearing/ignoring a lot of this. But when he starts in on trans issues, saying things like ""there's just no moral decency left in the world any more"" and ""if you're a human, you can't just up and be an airplane"" and ""they're gonna try to get rid of real men and women and take over"" and ""it's Sodom and Gomorrah out there,"" I feel the blood starting to drain from my face, my heart rate rising, that floating feeling coming on... all that fun triggery stuff. 

He's leaving no room for anyone else to speak, and I wish I could jump in, but I don't feel safe--I'm surrounded by this dude's bro friends in a small shop without a whole lot of other people nearby. I assume this is not directed at me; he has probably read me as female, as most people do; he also hasn't said anything about gay issues, which would be less socially acceptable to rant about in this city, so I think he's just an oblivious asshole rather than a deliberate troll. I know that if I say anything, I'll out myself. I physically can't make myself speak. I feel myself trying to make my body small. I'm staring at the same text message on my phone unable to read the words, angry with him for thinking it's ok to blast like this and angry with myself for being unable to do anything but keep breathing. I finally get to the point where I think I should just leave. But I need a haircut, and I've waited a while, and I don't want to let this guy chase me out of my usual barber shop.

Finally, he pauses his rant long enough to ask the barber, ""Do you know what I mean, man?"" And the barber says, ""No, I really don't know what you mean. I don't agree with anything you just said. You are entitled to your own opinion, but I think your opinion is wrong. Hey, I'm done--do you want to look at the back?""

And the guy just stops talking, pays, and leaves with his whole group. 

I then get the reliable haircut I came for. There isn't as much bantering with the barber as there usually would be, since I'm still coming down from what just happened. Again, I feel I want to say something, but I can't. I have all these conflicting feelings. I would have liked for him to step in and stop the guy from going off like that before it happened, but that's not his job any more than it is mine. He has no clue I am trans any more than the random guy, so he probably thought those words weren't hurting anyone who was actually present. But they were, and I do wish he would have taken that extra step to make his shop feel safe for everyone. 

But on the other hand, the second he replied the way he did, I felt so incredibly relieved, like the weight just lifted. I don't care what a random asshole thinks. I do care that my barber doesn't agree with him, and I give him credit for saying so, and it did shut the guy up when he did--just a little late. I'm grateful to him and a little resentful towards him all at once, which of course makes me feel greedy for wanting just a little more than I got. He could have said nothing at all, and I would still be triggered, and I might have just walked out. But instead I feel safe again and I got my hair cut.

When it's time to pay, I tip well (as always), and I say, ""This is for today's haircut. The next time I come in, that will be for what you said to that guy."" He shakes my hand and smiles, and while you can never really know from a simple gesture like that, it feels to me like he understands more than just what I said. And I go about my day.

I don't think anyone in this situation did exactly the right thing, but I also think it's rarely possible to do exactly the right thing. All I know is that I got triggered, bigtime, but I walked out of that place with the same great no-drama masculine haircut I like, and I felt good again. Maybe even a little better than I had before, because I already knew there were transphobic assholes all over, but I didn't know that my barber isn't one of them. Now I do, and I can keep coming back to this shop even though I had a nasty experience there today. That feels like a small victory, even if it's not a pure and glorious one.

I'm not feeling like I need support over this; I'm just sharing an experience others might be able to identify with, and would welcome any ideas about how others handle situations like this.",NonBinary,"Had an experience at the barber shop.

My biggest issue right now is where I want to go in the future with my transition. I don't know if I want HRT or not (leaning towards it) but I don't have anyone to talk to about it to help me figure it out. I have a therapist but she's not exactly... helpful. Let me try to explain.

2018-03-19 16:01:44,85kkf9,5,24,"Hello, SO I'll give a little backstory first. I came out as Non-Binary a few months ago. I had been struggling with my thoughts on my gender for a while, but I decided to push them to the back of my mind because I was getting a little weirdness from my fiance. Him obviously being uncomfortable with it I, I decided to just keep quiet about it and hope my feelings were just a phase. Well, one day I decided to actually tell someone I loved that I was NB with him present and I felt his soul go cold. We then had a long conversation about his feelings. The only thing I can remember about that conversation, and that has stuck with me since, is his thought of ""I want you to be happy, you deserve to be happy, but I'm afraid I wont love the person you become.""

This made my heart sink. He has all these irrational fears that I'm going to turn around and just become a man one day. Which is NOT the case at all. But the fact that I've been sitting with that statement, every time I upset him or talk about my queer experience, I feel like it makes him love me less and less. It took me a few weeks to get over what he said, and I had a talk with him about how I was feeling. Saying that I needed him to support me, because he was the reason I felt ready to come out in the first place. He made me brave enough, and to love myself enough to admit it. He admits that he doesn't like how I sometimes prefer to not have any of my feminine parts made more obvious i.e; touching my curvy hips or my butt, touching my nipples or breasts, etc. And how he thinks its odd that I bind my chest some days or sometimes the whole week. I consistently tell him I'm the same person, I just feel different on the inside then how I look on the outside. I simply begged for more support and understanding, even if it was just in the form of openly listening to my struggles/victories or telling me I look handsome in my button up shirt and tie. 
After that things were ok for a while, until one morning, I felt things were different. I had gotten up early for work, and as I was leaving he asked for a kiss goodbye. I kissed him and he said ""I love you"", I replied back, ""I love you too"". But immediately I felt this twinge in my stomach that felt like my soul questioning, ""Do you though?"" That was over two weeks ago, and I have been trying to push those thoughts away. But they keep coming back. Even last night, as we're laying in bed, he kisses me, I feel no warmth or love, I just feel horrible. Is the fact that he showed me how ""accepting"" he really was causing me to run away( because I honestly thought he would go to the ends of the earth to make me happy), or am I realizing that I'm just not enough of a woman for him anymore( sex has been difficult because of these feelings and my occasional dysphoria)? I don't know what to do with these thoughts because we've been together for so long, and hes such a wonderful man who cares about me and loves me deeply. I just don't know where to go from here. We've laid out so much foundation together, I feel like I have nothing without his support. What should I do?

TLDR; Came out as Non binary to my partner of 8 years, he didn't take it well, and I feel like I don't love him anymore/am not enough of a woman because of his feelings/worries about my gender.

edit: I am getting no help in r/relationshipadvice. I've already been told I have psychological issues and need to see a therapist. Please help. Some help from non cis people would really help me

Tonight, i went out running errands. I am admittedly not-passable and was dressed in a way that was feminine but largely androgynous overall, with the exception of plenty of pink :-)

I was at Starbucks, in line and saw someone i knew from a couple years ago. This person and i stayed at the same homeless shelter as i had been at that time. I literally slept 15 feet away from this person for a few months at one point in a church. We spent Christmas dinner together one year there and we both know each other a bit from it.

I turned to him and said 'Hey! Long time no see!' in a friendly tone and he looked at me in a state of panic i can't quite describe and shook his head 'no' and wouldn't speak.

I in a friendly way named the shelter we were at. He shook his head again longer as if to tell me, i won't admit i know you and i will not speak to you at all. It was clear.

I think he was terrified of being seen talking to a trans person in public was the issue. I know him well enough to know he is a little religious but he was always nice enough to me and had even seen me crossdressed years ago at times. I don't think he knew what to think of me but he seemed fine before.

This got me thinking about HRT and changes beyond just growing breasts which likely weren't all that visible to him given it's cold out here and i had a few layers on.

I've heard from others they didn't feel as though there were huge changes in their appearance but others close to them could see a change.

This experience i think taught me i may have changed more outwardly, skin, face, etc. perhaps in a few small ways enough for someone who fairly recently knew me before HRT, but hasn't seen me since i began to KNOW something is quite different.

It was odd. I've had people avoid me, I've had others (most) totally cool with it and some trying to understand it all.

Being a person who doesn't accept traditional femininity doesn't make me feel like I'm not a woman.

For those of you who are completely comfortable in your body, why do you identify as non binary? If it\'s solely because you do not fit into traditional gender roles and prefer to do your own thing, why does a different pronoun or gendered word make a difference? If you are biologically female but identify as non binary, and prefer to go by they, why is that?  Why does ""she"" or ""woman"" make you uncomfortable? Is it the traditional associations with those terms? \n\nIf we can agree that gender is a societal creation, and that you can have a male or female body and dress and act however you\'d like, why are pronouns or labels relevant? No disrespect, I just genuinely do not understand. ', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Questions from a cis female', 'created': 1521775872.0}"

So first, celebration! I've made a decision to go forward with breast reduction and feel mostly ok with it. I feel like its going to make me the most happy along with solving some medical issues for me. Thanks everyone that replied with support, validation, and advice. 

The next Dilemma: 
How do I go about finding a surgeon that is non-binary friendly? I'm not even sure how to go about how to ask people I know to use my they/them pronouns. My name is not legally changed and I go by something other than my name on my insurance. There are surgeons in my area that specialize in top surgery and therefore usually exclusively work with trans patients and have protocol and procedures in place but im not sure if they perform reduction. There are surgeons in my area that specialize in breast reduction and reshaping but I dont know how educated they are about non- binary trans-folk or even binary trans-folk they are. 

I have...no idea how to navigate this. Ive never been out to a provider before, and Ill need to get a yearly physical soon anyways. This will be a good thing to learn. Has anyone run into this before? Do you just deal with the dysphoria of it all and not come out? 

What has been your experiences?

2018-03-23 01:20:03,86gwf3,12,28,"So I plan to start HRT soon. I live halfway across the country from my parents and am mostly financially independent, so I'm not in any danger if things go poorly or whatever. But nonetheless, I feel like I should come out to my parents about this before I get started. Y'know, in case they decide don't want me coming home later in the summer. And because they'll probably end up finding out from someone else.

Aaaaanyway... I think that, if I told my parents I'm not a dude but a woman that they'd fight me on the matter and argue that it's a phase yadda yadda yadda. Ultimately I'd have to keep my foot down on the HRT, and they'd likely be a bit shocked and perhaps upset over the matter. But at least it'd be comprehensible to them; they've been made aware of trans people thanks to the recent surge in visibility.

The problem here is I don't think I can honestly say I'm not a dude but a woman. 'Cause the thing is, I don't feel like a dude, but I also don't feel like a woman.

I'm not saying my parents are bad people, by the way. They're just not woke or nothing. They've a pretty old-school understanding of the world... They didn't go to liberal arts schools. :p

I am new to this sub. I have been seeing a lot of posts along the lines of ""hey take a look - am I passing as NB?"". The person posting is asking if *visually* they ""look NB"" or ""pass as NB"". 

Not only does this reinforce gatekeepy ideas that a group of NB people on the internet get to decide if someone is ""passing"" or not.. but more importantly it reinforces the idea that there is a ""right"" way to look NB (or a set of many right ways). These aesthetics are almost always androgynous.

Let me be clear: there is nothing wrong with seeking affirmation. There is nothing wrong with having androgyny as a core component of your NB identitity.

But there is something wrong with perpetuating the idea that ""more androgynous"" = ""more NB"" or ""passing as NB"", or that others seeing you as androgynous means your NB identity is correct and valid. 

There are plenty of folks who have non-androgynous NB identities, and I believe the perpetuation of the ideas stated above are harmful to NB folks who don't identify as androgynous or seek to portray an androgynous aesthetic. 

It leaves us wondering if our femme or masc appearance is actually NB, especially if it ""matches"" our AGAB, because we don't have an appearance that is ""different"" from our AGAB whether it is androgynous or the other extreme end of the femme-masc spectrum or something else. At least, this is my experience. 

It leaves me asking myself, ""Is my appearance queer enough? Is it not-femme enough? How much do I need to alter my appearance from what it is now to ""pass"" as NB?""

2018-03-26 07:54:53,877em9,15,13,"Hello all,

Like many here, I experience distress around having periods, it's just the sense that, this is not something my body should be doing.

Fundamentally, I never identified with the ability to carry and birth a child. I understand that I have reproductive organs, but I've always felt, they shouldn't be there. Growing and producing a baby from the inside of me, is absolutely and completely alien and foreign, not something my body should ever, ever have been able to do.

Menstruation is a reminder of this, so it is distressing (much less so since I underwent a sterilization procedure eight years ago - that did not physically change my periods - but it made menstruating much less bothersome because, it is no longer connected to the ability to carry and birth a child.

That said, menstruating is still bother some, because it is still something that my body should not be doing, and it is coming from an organ that I should not have and do not want, so I would like to stop/eliminate or at least reduce the

Obvious solution is hormonal BC. I've never tried it, but I hesitate, b/c I have physically perfect cycles, purely physically it can't get better and any side effects could screw it up. It's very regular, almost no cramps or pains, no mood swing or anger irritation *changes* (that's to say, no more anger *than usual*, lol) no acne, no headaches, no migrains, no bloating. I don't want the hormones to cause some side effect, like I heard, some users can get suicidal! I'm also afraid of side effects like bigger breasts, I don't even want to risk that.

The hormonal IUD is only localized hormones, but I've known people who had side effects from that too, e.g. suddenly developed acne after not having acne for years or had migraines for the first time in their lives

So any other ideas on how to eliminate periods without hormones, or with minimal hormonal interference?

So today I was impulsive and anyway I just started at a gym (orange theory), and it's only been a month but they say ""Hi feelingsofwhite"" everytime and after today I went up and was like ""um, yeah, so my birth cirtificate and blahblahblah and anyway I go by feelingsofwhite sometimes, and I'd prefer that""  ""you mean like on the emails and stuff?""

I did it.

I really did it.

I asked someone to call me feelingsofwhite instead of feelingsofwhite.  It feels so new that i worry I'm just on a tangent.  It feels so old than most people who know me are just unaware of it.  If feels so familiar like a part of me that was always there.  It all just feels like feelingsofwhite

So tomorrow is my monthly appointment. We were going to talk about one of my mental health issues, but I plan to instead steer the conversation toward one bullet point on my list: gender dysphoria. 

To say I'm nervous is an understatement. I've only met this doctor a couple times so far; I'm in a pretty left-leaning city, but I don't know if he's worked with trans people. I want to be firm in my convictions about myself while giving him all the information he needs. 

Does anyone have pointers? Strategy? Things to include on my list? Because I always go to my appointments with lists.

2018-03-29 08:59:20,87zs5w,5,7,"What if there was a treatment for [insert debilitating condition] here but the cost of it was everything that ever mattered to you? And what if it wasn't a guaranteed cure? Would you take it if you could live with the condition and it wasn't fatal?

That feels like the rock and the hard place situation I find myself in with the idea of transition. Like, fuck, I can't make that sacrifice. Losing all the things in my life that matter to me would make me suicidal in a way that my dysphoria doesn't. Losing the support structures that literally keep me together feels like burning down my house because I found a spider in it. Maybe that'll someday change and my ""house"" will be plagued with nests of black widows but right now it's just a house spider and I take it outside and hope it doesn't come back in for a while. It's been lurking recently, but it's still just a harmless house spider. Frightening, but not deadly.

But then of course I'm used to dealing with stuff on my own. I've always been too proud to see a therapist, even though I know I have autistic traits, Pure OCD, mild to moderate depression, anxiety and a ton of baggage left over from being bullied at school, I scrape though by trying to see the best in things and being as functional as I can (and to my credit, I hold down a full time job and the cracks rarely show, which makes me think a therapist wouldn't even diagnose some of the things I've seen in myself as being clinically significant).

Maybe this would be easier if I was binary trans but I'm not. I'd have a path that is a bit clearer but instead there's a list of what T does and some of the side-effects fill me with euphoria and some with terror. I did that gender swap app thing and looked like my father and that's not me either. There's still a feminine side to my emotional identity that I'm not willing to sacrifice. There's a name that's the name my mother gave me one half of and my spouse gave me the other half of and I'm not willing to throw away either part. There are pronouns that I'm so used to that I even misgender myself. There's a job that I would undoubtedly lose (or at least become mocked and derided at). There's a spouse whom I love with everything I've got who, when I broached the subject, said that he could accept calling me ""he"" but not ""they"", because he doesn't believe in non-binary genders and is pretty rigid about the things he's learned in life (He hates even learning a new button layout on a video game controller). I was hurt and tried to stay calm but ended up sounding like I was giving a lecture and even I thought I came off sounding like a douche when I tried to explain. We had to stop talking about it because I'm so raw and confused and can't seem to explain what it really means.

I feel like I'm doing all of this so, so badly and I'm serving nobody, least of all myself. I feel like I'm not ready for any of this, but most of all I feel like the world's not ready for me. And I'm not sure I can proceed down any kind of route without support from my spouse. I'm not like other people. I can't sacrifice my marriage. The love of my life is the one point in my universe that gives me meaning, and I take great pride in the fact that I've been happily married for 12 years. To fuck that up for *this* seems absurd to me based on my own personal priorities in life (your mileage may vary and I'd never judge anyone who made different choices, you have to do what's right for you).

I don't even know how to proceed at this point. I just calmly try to keep talking when I feel brave enough to broach the subject. I try to do little things for myself to make me feel more comfortable. I try to figure myself out best I can and define it so that it's easier to explain, but it's so HARD to put words to this nebulous concept that is gender and dysphoria and the ""wrongness"" I feel.

I do know that it's not going to go away now that I've named it and acknowledged it properly. The dreams are going to continue. I know that the spider is mine to keep whether I want it here or not. I've thought about going to therapy, but that's a financial strain I'm not sure I can afford and I'm afraid I'll either not connect with the therapist or end up being pushed down a road I'll regret later. Or everything will come tumbling out and I'll completely collapse.

I can't live a life of denying who I am or I'll resent it. That's why I came out as bisexual before I married. I understand that. But I'm not sure how to live a life where I accept myself but also make some sacrifices to keep my life the way it is. Maybe I want to have my cake and eat it and it's impossible. But I've always tried to be someone who asks for very little. I'd be okay if I could just mitigate my dysphoria a little bit, do something affirming... but I'm too scared to even like, buy a binder. I bought a sports bra and it didn't even fit like the size chart said because I have large shoulders, and that took so much emotional energy I just feel like I can't... so I wait and I wait, hoping something will change in my life or the world that makes this all easier and less destructive.

I suppose I just want to be told that everything's going to be all right. Only I'm not sure I believe it any more. I'd settle for things being OK for a few more years at this point. I feel like I just got my shit together in life and I deserve to enjoy it... and then all this crap fell out of my closet and I resent that a little bit... does that make sense?

Hoping I'm not coming off as shitty or phobic anywhere in this post. Because I don't hate anyone. In fact I like to support trans people who need a boost on a bad day because yeah, I totally get how rough this shit is. And I admire the people who've had to burn their lives down to survive and walk out of the flames as amazing, strong, authentic people. I wish I could be strong enough, but I'm not strong enough. Unless it's 'transition or die' I'm not sure I'll ever be strong enough.

I'm not sure what I need from this post just needed to let some of this stuff out. It's hurting and I need to voice it. So say what you can say, be as cutting as you need to be, but don't judge me if I'm not willing or able to take your (probably good) advice.

Thanks for reading.
