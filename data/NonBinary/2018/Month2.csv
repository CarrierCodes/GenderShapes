Anyone here on HRT? What are your experiences and doses? How often do you take It? Recommended medications? I'm not in any hurry, I want to take it slow and let the meds do their job safely but I have no idea where to start.

2018-02-01 07:12:24,7uh1l8,4,10,"Hi! 

So I am 19 years old and amab and I have been dating my girlfriend for almost 2 years. For a little while now I have been thinking about my gender identity and realized I may be non binary. I have been holding this in and over FaceTime tonight I accidentally told her. She was pretty confused and shaken by it. Over the course of the night she fluctuated between saying that it will take time but she loves me and wants me to be comfortable, to begging me to just be a guy. 

To complicate this I don’t really have the vocabulary to describe how I feel yet so this only makes her confusion worse. I’m worried that as I go through this process of figuring myself out this will hang over our relationship and she will look at me differently. 

I was wondering if there was any advice people had to make this go as smoothly as possible and to help her understand, I am willing to give her that time to understand and ideally ending the relationship is not what I want. I’m more focused on helping her come to terms with it than leaving her immediately, although if she can never accept it that may have to happen.

I'm bi-gender - not androgyne - I am male OR female, depending on the day and context, and that in-between place drives me nuts. And my body is entirely mixed up/androgynous.

I'm AFAB, 5'9"", naturally no hips (too narrow to give birth, I had my kids by caesarian), square waist, large breasts, long but very well muscled legs, a wide, well-muscled back, and my face is, er, handsome rather than pretty (gamine is a term that was used recently) and I have a mild widow's peak hairline that becomes more pronounced when I'm on T. Even my fat distribution is masculine - when I was fat all my fat went to my belly - I still had NO hips. If I work out/become fit, I bulk up like a guy, even without taking T. When I was a four-sport athlete as a teen (swim, cheer, X country, track, and I tried football but my mom wouldn't sign the football waiver, so I put myself in the football PE class), my thighs were separately thicker than my waist.

I generally come off as a very masculine female, with the exception of my boobs, which is enhanced by my frequently male behavior and unconscious body language. If I'm going to be sir'ed, it's from behind, because the moment they get a load of my boobs, it's rather clear what I am.

I tried for nearly four decades to ignore/deny that side of me, and it didn't work (dysphoria galore). So now I'm trying to figure out how to be myself, which sucks because I don't WANT to be a guy. But when I acknowledge the guy side of me the dysphoria goes away. I kinda like the guy side of me, but I don't want to BE him.

2018-02-06 22:38:08,7vrba2,3,5,"I'm super nervous, but I decided I'm finally going to allow myself to explore this. I'm not sure if I experience dysphoria or not. Here's a list of reasons I'm questioning. If anyone can relate or if I sound a certain way please let me know, I know my own subconscious tends to push back on my questioning and brush it aside so I don't know if I'm just blind to the obvious or if it's as ambiguous as I think. So here's a few things just off the top of my head.

* I have always hated my name, it's too girly for me
* Usually when I wear makeup I feel awkward, I honestly FEEL like I look like a man wearing makeup even though I know I don't. Same thing goes for wearing dresses and other ""girly"" clothes.
* I'm pretty short and thin but view myself as larger than I am. It catches me off guard when people make references to my size. Possibly because I work out a lot and even though I'm still small, only I can see the progress I've made compared to how I used to look.
* I work in a male-dominated field and sometimes when I speak at work my voice catches me off guard because I expect it to be deeper. Not sure if this is dysphoria or just me wanting to fit in, but it feels significantly weird emotionally
* I have downloaded apps trying to see how I would look with a buzz cut and facial hair... they all sucked for what it's worth
* Previously when I've let myself think about possibly being trans or GNC I've found myself thinking that if only I was taller it would be much easier to make a decision, I guess I'm hesitant about being such a little dude
* A while ago I was at a festival trying to find a bathroom, ended up in some restaurant using the men's room because whoever was in the women's was taking too long. The door didn't have a lock but I had to pee too bad to care. A guy ended up opening the door without knocking and retreated upon seeing me but I could hear him yell ""THERE'S A GIRL IN THERE""... it's really hard to explain but this freaked me out. Kinda feels like I forget I'm a girl and when others see me as one I am confused or just feel weird and somewhat bummed about it.
* My self-esteem regarding my attractiveness is strong enough to where I occasionally wonder if I'm actually narcissistic lol, but if someone calls me pretty I feel like I don't trust it... I have been called handsome a couple of times and though I was confused about why they chose that word, I felt pretty fly
* (nsfw) At least 9 out of 10 times when I jerk off I'm imagining myself with a penis.
* When I was younger I played a couple MMO's and on each one had two accounts, one was a female character and one was male 
* As a kid I remember praying that I would wake up the next day as a boy.
* Related to how I hate my name: I also remember thinking that I would be happy as a boy even with any name, even ones I didn't like, like ""Guy"" (lol?).
* Also, I remember feeling disappointed as a kid because in my opinion, men couldn't be ugly but women had to work hard to be pretty. For what it's worth, I'm bisexual and also no longer hold this opinion, lol. But my response to it back then was that I was so jealous that I'd prefer being a man to working hard to be pretty.
* Lastly, being bisexual I do date men and women and somehow I feel more gay when I'm with a man.

I realize that I'm probably not cis at least but something in me is so opposed to exploring beyond that, so this is me trying to get over that. I don't know how, or if I would ever want to, tell anyone else about being anything other than cis. I have long hair and aside from not wearing much makeup and avoiding blatantly feminine clothes I don't think anyone would ever think that I'm questioning this unless I've opened up to them about little things here and there and they thought too much about it. I'm not sure why but I'm nervous to talk to anyone in real life about it. I already posted this in the ""questioning"" subreddit but I wanted to put it here too in case anyone nonbinary can relate or if people think I just sound trans or what. If it's not cool to post in multiple subs please let me know, I don't use reddit aside from lurking on other subs until now so I apologize if that's considered spamming.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Hey all! First time posting on this site. Please pardon any missteps.


&amp;nbsp;


I'm looking for help finding a word for my gender.


&amp;nbsp;


Going through questioning gave me a much better understanding of my gender, but I'm still left looking for a way to get that understanding across without writing out paragraphs. XD I'd like to find a word for my gender identity that's more specific than 'nonbinary' alone (which is what I currently use) but not too obscure, and I'm running into trouble.


&amp;nbsp;


There may not be a non-obscure word, and that's okay! Nonbinary is better than nothing, and I don't want to end up with a term I'll just have to end up re-explaining anyway.


&amp;nbsp;


If I try to describe my gender, could anyone tell me if they know any terms off the top of their head that might fit? (Not looking for anyone to do research on my behalf!)


&amp;nbsp;


My gender is:

- a ""positive"" sense of gender (not as in ""good,"" more as in ""testing positive""; I'm not agender, and terms like ""void"" don't describe my sense of gender)

- a single, discrete gender (not bigender/multigender, not experienced as a mix of genders)

- static (neither fluid nor flux)

- neither binary male nor binary female (and not significantly aligned with either)

- unrelated to gender roles/expression/etc


&amp;nbsp;


I have physical dysphoria along transmasc lines (I'm AFAB), but I don't think I could be considered transmasculine because I don't feel like my gender is close enough to male. While I know that if I complete the transition steps I want, I might be read as male, that's more a side effect of the steps instead of a goal. (I'd rather be read as *neither* binary gender, but no one would automatically think ""neither"" rather than ""idk which,"" so I might as well try to relieve my physical dysphoria and take whatever comes.)


&amp;nbsp;


I also don't see my gender as ""neutral,"" particularly because whenever I see that word come up, it seems to overlap with being agender or otherwise lacking in gendered feeling. That's the opposite of my experience. I don't have ""nothing"" just because it's ""neither"".


&amp;nbsp;


If I had to put my gender on a line between ""man"" and ""woman,"" then I'd say it'd be in the middle, but I don't perceive it as half-and-half or anything like that. It exists in relation to binary genders but remains its own, discrete thing. My experience of gender is not a duality or a mix. Sort of like how, even though I developed from a combination of my parents' genes, my sense of self arising from that physical combination is not ""half-Mom, half-Dad."" I'm related to them, but a separate individual. Or like baking a cake: can't make it without the ingredients, but a piece of cake is not the same as having eggs and flour and such, and you wouldn't be able to get eggs back out of a baked cake.

2018-02-09 14:31:08,7wds76,14,13,"Dear stars in the sky, does this make me fucking embarrassed.

I'm nonbinary?

I'm posting this because I'm starting to dwell to much of it and thought that maybe voicing it for a change would help with that.

I'm tired of recurrent, cyclical questioning that only results in a negative identity: I'm not like this, I'm not like this either, Oh fuck I'm also not like this other thing.

People close to me are pretty fucking adamant that I am /not like the other guys/ and well, it isn't any secret that I've never really felt one of them, and if you throw me into a guys-only environment chances are I'm going to either have trouble or at least stick out

Yet I'm very obviously not a girl, and even if I have thought a lot of times that I'd like to be one, it's always been more of a ""wanting to be a girl _too_"", and I very seriously don't want to have *my* body cut up.

Because why do we have to mandatorily be one-or-the-other?

I mean, it's totally cool that there are manly men and womanly women, but enforcing it just misses out on so much human potential.

I'm AMAB and I don't think I've ever felt like a cis het guy more than fleetingly. But I'm not a gay man, because I do like women. I'm pretty sure I'm bisexual, but haven't had the chance to confirm (but I don't crave it either so that's okay).

I'm also pretty sure I'm not a transwoman because trying to become an actual woman to me just sounds like locking myself further into a different form, and if at all I'd want more freedom, not less, and not ""the same freedom in different options after great toil and irreversible procedures"".

I think I'm not a crossdresser because well, I've never felt an urge to crossdress. I'd like to be able to wear some girlier clothes as a normal thing; but I don't want to split myself and I'm not into wearing dresses, blouses or makeup - just as I'm not into wearing suits, ties, or having a beard. So yeah, doing strongly gendered stuff just puts me off. 

Seriously, it's like some dial in my head has always been misaligned by a notch, or got knocked off at some point, not by a huge amount but by a small-yet-noticeable-amount that shows itself almost everywhere sooner or later.

SAGE said that I ""socialize androginously"" and the combined whatever inventory for MtFs called me ""androgyne"" (and kinda shrugged to the point that a digital self-report test can shrug) - For what that kind of thing is worth.

Trying to look at myself as non-binary, or just as ""other"" gives me a drive to be more in control of my body and to do things that before I just didn't see the point of doing, BOTH boy-coded and girl-coded things.  It makes me look forward.

I'm started to feel convinced it just makes a whole lot more sense.

And now, for those that read the whole thing, here's a little joke translated from my mother tongue:

There are three babies awake in the neonatal unit of a hospital.
Looking at the immediate surroundings, one of the babies says: ""Hey, looks like I'm a boy, because they gave me blue socks!"", which prompted the next baby to say ""And they gave me pink socks, so I guess I'm a girl?"". After a while, the third baby chimes in with great consternation: ""Guys, I'm fucked. I don't know what I am - My balls are so big I can't see my fucking socks!!""

2018-02-09 16:49:37,7weqi0,3,7,"CW: invalidation, genital inquiry 

Hi r/nonbinary!

I am an AFAB, bisexual enby. Lived my whole life dysmorphic as all hell, finally found the identity and presentation that makes me feel at home in my own skin. My husband is SO supportive and honestly a huge blessing in the face of such a dichotomous society. Not really in a place to change my name/pronouns, but I buzzed my hair and bought my first binder! Yay!

I have a job working with college students on the Autism spectrum. Through some underhanded “queer competition” I ended up getting pressured into coming out in my office. It’s a pretty typical office setting but I’m definitely the youngest of the “professional” office staff, working with college students on the spectrum as well as student mentors. 

I thought in an office full of generally aware humans and social workers, it would be more effective to get ahead of everything. So I came out to my boss (approx 30ish) and an older coworker (probs 45?). I just plainly presented myself, acknowledging my physical presentation bc I tend to feel more comfortable in Masc business casual clothes. I stated what my gender identity and sexuality were and the fact that I’m pretty strongly rooted in the LGBTQ+ population. 

Fast forward to last week. My boss took an opportunity when we were alone to kinda confirm my sexuality since she was confused. It was humble and appropriate and I felt respected. No stress. 

Yesterday, my coworker told me that she and my supervisor had to google what “non binary is” and it resulted in an EXTREMELY uncomfortable and unexpected conversation with someone who is entirely disconnected from the LGBTQ community. She flip flopped between “my generation just doesn’t care about bedroom business” and “I’m just so curious, how do they do it?” (In reference to trans acquaintances.) Sparing some of the worst parts, it was probably the lowest I’ve been since coming to terms with my gender ID myself. I will always be willing to educate and converse. I don’t think any of the conversation was meant to be combative. I just didn’t anticipate having this conversation with an adult and not a student with ASD who would struggle to understand “grey” in their very black vs white world. Those conversations have been fine, probably because they weren’t blindsiding. 

So, friends, are there any good resources out there to help enbys who want to be themselves and educate others without reinventing the wheel? What helped you feel confident and out without this one portion of your identity overshadowing the other awesome parts of you?

So I came out to my boss (approx 30ish) and an older coworker (probs 45?).

I stated what my gender identity and sexuality were and the fact that I’m pretty strongly rooted in the LGBTQ+ population. \n\nFast forward to last week.

2018-02-15 15:27:06,7xr294,1,10,"The Scottish Government is currently consulting on proposed changes to Gender Recognition.

The main points are:

* **Self declaration**  
Let trans people get official recognition of their gender without the current requirement of a psychiatric report.
* **16-17 year olds**  
Let trans people apply for gender recognition from 16, the age at which young people in Scotland are deemed to have full legal capacity.
* **Non-binary**  
Let non-binary people have their gender fully legally recognised through self-declaration.

This consultation is **vital** and closes on the 1 March at 17:00 (GMT). If the Scottish Gov gets more negative responses than positive ones it will be extremely difficult for them to justify updating legal gender recognition. If the number of negative responses is large then the rights of trans people are at risk of being rolled back, not only in Scotland but also in the whole of the UK.

**Most unfortunately, the media has been particularly hostile about trans equality in recent weeks and so there is a REAL RISK that this negative media coverage will encourage a larger number of negative responses. So now more than ever we need people to respond to the consultation!**

Please take 10 min to complete a positive response. You can find a guide and link to the consultation at

**http://equalrecognition.scot/consultation/**

Not all the questions need to be answered. Even saying something simple like “I support trans rights” already helps. They do ask for a name and e-mail address but these can be kept confidential.

2018-02-19 06:18:58,7ykoyn,6,5,"So, most of my life I've had a complicated relationship with my gender. I tried transitioning from ftm when I was 20. I felt really uncomfortable with the pressure to be more masculine than I am, and ended up transitioning back to female. I spent a few more years ignoring the confusion and just trying to get by in life, and not really thinking about why I felt so deeply annoyed with being perceived as female all the time. Now, after returning to school and meeting a whole bunch of young adults who have all these wonderful new words to describe gender, I feel like I'm starting to be a lot more honest with myself and my own gender. With that comes a lot of that old dysphoria I'd learned to shove deep into the closet again. 

But I'm also not a guy. I learned that already. I'm a person who should have a beard, a deep voice, and a ballin makeup game, but doesn't. 

I still fluctuate between masc and femme. But I've been wanting more and more to go on T, I have a queer doctor now who would happily make that happen if I talked to her about it, and I'm very conflicted. While I know I'd feel happy if the entire world was a Queer Island and I could go anywhere being my sparkly, bearded self, I'm terrified of the reality of violence against trans women and feminine men, and I know from experience it is safer in some ways to be a masculine-presenting woman than it is to be a feminine-presenting man; it is somewhat safer to be a trans man than a trans woman; and I'm familiar with the territory of safety I have as the body I currently own. Going on T will mean that while my own identity has not shifted, the way the world sees me will shift and I do not know that territory. 

So. Perspectives? Does anyone who operates as a masculine-perceived person with noticeable feminine qualities have any insight, positive or negative experiences, advice, etc. you are willing and able to share? 

Much appreciated and much love,

I don't like how it looks, how it feels, or dealing with it.

I have unavoidable greyface, I can't help cutting myself every time I shave, it's so bristly it stings on the inside.

So I end up nicking my face at least a couple times every time I shave, something I'd rather not do; something I feel like I'm doing almost for nothing because afterwards I still have this thing on my face, and yet the best thing I can do is shave every other day (I can't shave every day, my face doesn't take it) because if I let it bristle, it makes my face physically uncomfortable and makes me feel ugly and grumpy.

So I kind of want it gone off the face of this treacherous world, but I'm scared of potential consequences, whether people will freak out, or give me a lot of shit, or if I'll look horrible, etc.

I'm dearly convinced they love me both despite and for what I'm like, in a general sense, which is mostly the same I feel for them, and I guess that's the reason we're friends.

But there's still something hard to pin down that puzzles me to no end.

On one hand, they have pushed and prodded and pricked me into questioning, several times along my life, in various ways.

On the other hand, whenever I've tried to reach, talking with them, any conclusion about myself more solid than a fleeting ""I don't think I feel inside like most other people with dicks"", suddenly I'm not to be taken seriously - I'm probably just bored and need to conjure up problems when there are none.

That somehow I was ""less standard"" than the soft, sassy, beautiful fat kid of a gay man he has for spouse (yes, they're happily married) torn me up inside to no end.

There are other anecdotes, like a couple of people, who are really important to me, insisting on wondering what I'd be like if I had been a girl (to the point I felt compelled to draw a genderbent self-portrait in order to make one of them shut up by blowing their mind), or somehow having written on my forehead ""I'm a person you can confess your childhood cross-gender fantasies to""; because women seem quite ready to spontaneously tell me that kind of thing.

And yet I'm discouraged from developing a substantive identity; and from acknowledging how deep it runs, that it's not _only_ a superficial thing.

I haven't really figured myself out yet. I just started questioning recently, despite being in my 30's. I'm starting to believe I'm not strictly cis, but I'm not sure how far across the aisle I truly identify, yet.

I finally had some free time to socialize with a close friend, the other day. It doesn't happen often, anymore! We've known each other forever. 

As we were catching up, I felt great vibes coming from the conversation, and I suddenly felt like sharing a little more than the usual 'guy' fluff. I started by saying, I'd decided to focus on self improvement this year, and that I'd decided to try therapy, since it was covered by insurance.

He was intrigued and excited; asked me how I liked it so far?  He'd had rough times in the past, and had thought seeing someone would have helped. 

I told him it was great! I was having fun, finding ways to improve my marriage and be more empathetic. I told him... I'd been feeling sort of confined by stereotypical masculinity.

...That's it.

* I didn't tell him I was questioning my gender.
* I didn't tell him I might be trans or non-binary.
* I didn't tell him I was curious about hormones.

-even though I am, to all of those things. Just a *sliver* of a hint: ""I'm feeling a little trapped by masculinity.""

He immediately agreed; ""yeah, man! They even have a name for it now: 'toxic masculinity,' right? It's all bullshit, trying to tell boys they can't have feelings. I know how you feel!""

And then we played some more video games. We spent the day hanging out, chatting and playing games. When it was time to head back to work life, we brought it in for a hug.

I realized I don't hug friends enough. 

It's not much, but it felt good to share just a hint and have it so well received.  It felt validating, even though it was just brushing the surface.

Write about your gender. 

... 

My gender is James. I have always been James, I think. Or maybe they grew up out of the fresh earth decayed from Lex or Wander or Deadname. I do not know, I can't find out. I do not care. 

James is now. James is this year. James is candor and pain and scary conversations about pronouns and how much 'James' I can be. 

James is a one-syllable word with the same first letter of my deadname. It is also the name of a (in my opinion) flamboyantly genderqueer character from the Pokémon anime. It is my name. I chose it in thirty seconds, tops. And now people call me that. I think I like it. 

James calls themself male, but really, they're not. Body dysphoria or whatever aside ('cause who cares honestly), deep down, James sexually identifies as a punk. Not a girl, not a boy, not a xeumel or the other X-words people have put a lot of thought into. Just a punk. 
Even though you don't need to be a punk to be a CripplePunk, I'm both. My gender is CripplePunk, is Queercrip, is identity politics no matter what. 

That's probably unhealthy, isn't it? 

I don't care. 

I am James. My skin is pallor-white and laced with starry scars from things I cannot talk about. My body is webbed and curved and bony, but as I wait I feel it getting softer. I am excited to feel myself growing layers of squish, of fat, of forgiveness. It makes me proud. 

My personality is quite shit. I've been told that many times by people who also have quite shit personalities, but also by people who are quite nice or in between. I don't really care. I'm an extrovert, but years of parental neglect has made other people's opinions on my character not really matter to me. I can get by with a few very little love kernels from people I like. 

I don't need many validation kernels for my gender either. Being called a girl doesn't even hurt anymore. It just feels numb. Maybe it carries a faint hot stinging that radiates up from my chest for half a second and then dissipates. Sometimes being called a boy does that too. I mean, I like ""male"" terms sometimes — boyfriend, husband, 'sir' maybe. Things that used to make me quake from happiness sometimes still feel quite nice. But it's all relative. 

Now I feel euphoric when I'm called ""Mx."" James has been writing this poem in a mixture of first and third person because they like when people use they/them pronouns, it feels sharp and clear and like something other than the numb 's/he's I have convinced myself I don't care about. 

I mean, if someone must err, I'd rather they erred on the side of ""he"" rather than ""she."" ""He"" is what I will one day settle for, when I am an adult who speaks a gendered language. I am sure one day it will feel acceptable. 

But back when I still felt euphoria, I felt it for my queerness, for my certainty and freedom granted within for all eternity by my enbyhood. For that one day, it glittered, it ached. It was— 

It was everything I knew and everything I wanted, stitched into my skin and plastered onto me, into me, crochet and braided lanyards and embroidered tapestry all at once, 
All over me, inescapable — 
Mx., They/them 

I'm such a loser 
(And I don't care! Or at least, I'm trying not to.) 



But the mocking internal voice of my ""true transsexual"" scum former self makes it feel ridiculous, impossible, illegitimate and pointless to desire 
So when it's not respected, should I care? 
Do I even have a right to? 
If I am one in a hundred, one in a thousand, one in a something and my feeling is unique and unnameable and psychotic and unreal (?¿?), does it count at all? 
Maybe so, maybe not 
I don't care 
I am too scared to talk about it still 

And yet, and yet, I hope every day that somebody will acknowledge it 
I hope day after day, like I did before, and it never happened, never happens 
That's okay 
It's time to leave it 
For another day.

In short; is it valid to mostly identify as the gender I was assigned, and be comfortable with that gender, but also NOT want to be my assigned gender, because I feel like it limits who I really am?

Testosterone gives one super powers like a warm body, muscles, resistens to sunburn, oily skin, a mellow state of mind and male privileges. But it will also give me a hairy body and male pattern baldness.

Estrogen will give me a prettier body I can feel comfortable with, more connected to my emotions and fair skin but it will also give me dry skin, become more prone to sunburn, a colder body and it can diminish my vision acuity if I am unlucky.

I was lost for most of my life, because I knew I was different and couldn't pin point why I wasn't like most of my friends.  I was a very depressed girl most my life and confused about a lot.  I didn't know who I was, and I finally realized I was lesbian and came out..  Life got so much brighter, and so much made sense.  It felt amazing, and I just all around felt better.   I don't really like labels, and have never got into the classifications of the ""type"" of lesbian I am.  I am just me.
Anywho, lets fast forward.  I have always hated my boobs, and tend to wear a very tight sports bra to hide them.  I know I am absolutely comfortable and love being a woman, and I love boobs...just not on me and not my own.  I enjoy wearing boys clothes (tomboy classification I guess), and I also like to wear makeup and sometimes paint my nails.  I am not always comfortable in ""girly clothes,"" but will wear them even if i'm not comfortable. obviously, I strive and support everyone to be who they are now and always have been.  I am a million percent fine with being a lesbian, and support anyone that is who they are and who they always have been.
I fell in love with my best friend of almost 5 years, and we are now together.  It is simply amazing.  my life with her feels so complete and she is the best thing that has walked into my life along with her son.  I am truly lucky.  she loves getting cute for not only me, but for herself.  I absolutely love when she does, and thought I would get cute for her.  so I bought a couple skirts and a couple outfits.  I couldn't bring myself to wear them.  it just felt uncomfortable.  I finally put one on for her, and felt so uncomfortable when I did.  she thought it was cute and loved it.  however, I felt meh and out of place.  she knows all of my deepest thoughts, struggles, etc...she asked me one night: gf ""don't get mad, but I want to ask you a question""
me ""go ahead and ask, it would be hard for me to get mad at you for asking me a question""
gf ""I've known you for a long time..have you ever wondered or thought about you being gender queer?""
I had never been asked that, nor really looked into it.  I really don't know who I am most the time.  I read into it.  I knew what non binary was, but I have never really put any thought into any of it.  So much hit home, and so much made sense yet again.
