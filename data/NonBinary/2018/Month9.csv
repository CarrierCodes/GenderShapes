I'm having a slight identity crisis over if I am indeed nonbinary or not.
Ever since I was a kid I didn't really stick to the  female stereotype nor male stereotype. 
I felt pretty neutral about literally everything, cloth, toys etc.
When i reach puberty relating to being a girl became harder, everything other girls my age didn't make any sense to me, I adopted a boyish style and it made me feel so comfortable, yet I didn't relate to boys either. Both genders felt foreign to me.
When I was 15 I got romantically involved with an older boy - he was 20, I know that's pretty messed up- who kept pushing me to be more ""girly"" asking me to wear make up and stop being boyish and it made me so uncomfortable. That until he dumbed me, and it wracked my self-worth.
After that I became obsessed with being a ""girl"" I did everything from make-up to pretty girly cloth and I did succeed and was very female passing and very attractive and I remember I used to get pretty upset when I get misgendered ( when someone uses he/him pronounces) .
But it made me miserable, it only fed my insecurities and I felt ugly/worthless whenever I didn't dress like a girl or wore make-up.
I was pretty depressed then, I didn't feel better until I stopped pushing myself, stopped wearing make-up and overly girly cloth. 
The more I became gender neutral the better I felt, and that when I learn about Nonbinary.
It made so much sense.
I don't feel like I identify as strictly a male or female, any pronounce is fine with me, even tho she/her is more appealing cause idk I'm really used to it?

how is non-binary any different than being a masculine woman or feminine man? 

what if non-binary people just have difficulty coping with being gender non-conforming with regards to their expression to the point they feel they must claim a new gender identity?

since some non-binary people claim to have gender dysphoria, are they dysphoric of both masculine and feminine traits? do non-binary people transition to androgyny? do most non-binary people even transition?

why are most non-binary people ""assigned female at birth""? is it because of internalized misogyny? trying to get attention?

with regards to biological sex, there are mainly two sexes (male and female -- sperm and eggs) and a minority of intersex people (people who are sterile and people who can only make sperm or eggs). does society really need to make extra identity labels for intersex people or should intersex people just align with whatever sex best represents them physically (genitals, hormone levels, secondary sex characteristics).

I came out to my parents a little while back, and I'm getting to the point where I really need to come out to my immediate family (siblings, niblings, etc.) and start living openly as trans. I was in a queer prom music recently, and it got posted a few days ago. The song is about gender non-conformity, which seems like the perfect avenue into this discussion.

I have a whole bunch of immediate family and I don't see them all that often so doing it face-to-face isn't really an option, but we have a family facebook group where I want to post my coming out letter. But I've not done this whole coming out thing very well before, so I'd really appreciate some feedback. Is it too long/too wordy? I'm a mess of anxiety right now and idk how to preface this very well lmao but I'd love it if people let me know your thoughts, if I should change anything, and some general encouragement because I'm highkey freaking out about doing this, but I know I need to do it today or it'll take me forever to build up the courage (I've already chickened out so many times)

&gt;I was in a music video!! (for like three shots of the back of my head, but still)  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzU7aIk1dGI&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzU7aIk1dGI&amp;feature=youtu.be)  
The first time I heard this song, it resonated with me so much and encapsulated near-perfectly how I‚Äôve been feeling for some time, so to get to be part of the queer prom shoot for Grace was such an amazing day, and it‚Äôs been an important part of me gaining the confidence to start being open about my own identity and start living authentically. So I‚Äôve got something important I want to share with you guys, and it‚Äôs been a long time coming. It‚Äôs the kind of thing I‚Äôd ideally like to talk to y‚Äôall about in person, but there are so bloody many of you that this is the only convenient way to get the word out.  
As a baby, I was sorted into the ‚Äúpink‚Äù category, but about two and a half years ago now, I realised that ‚Äúwoman/girl‚Äù didn‚Äôt accurately describe the way I felt. I‚Äôve always been tomboyish and never really cared about whether my actions, the clothes I wore, the toys I played with, etc. were considered masculine or feminine, but I ended up discovering it ran much deeper than that ‚Äì I‚Äôm not just a tomboyish girl, and there were underlying reasons for the fact I felt disconnected to the feminine identity that other girls my age seemed so in-tune with.  
I came to find that the labels ‚Äútransgender‚Äù and ‚Äúnon-binary‚Äù was the best way to describe me (which are terms referring to people who identify with a different gender than the one they were assigned at birth, and people who don‚Äôt wholly identify as male or female respectively), rather than man or woman. Over the better part of three years since I realised this, I‚Äôve only become more sure that it‚Äôs the right thing for me. Living and presenting as female feels dishonest, and it makes me really uncomfortable to be seen as something that I‚Äôm not, whereas introducing myself to people as the non-binary person I am is really liberating and makes me feel so much happier and more comfortable, even though it‚Äôs really scary to come out as something that a lot of people may not understand or believe in.  
In terms of what this means for you guys, I‚Äôd really appreciate it if people referred to be with gender-neutral language and used they/them/theirs pronouns for me (i.e. ‚Äúthis is my sibling **deadname**, they are a ginger.‚Äù), including when I‚Äôm not around. I appreciate it‚Äôs a difficult thing to get used to so please don‚Äôt worry if you mess up! (I haven‚Äôt found a good gender-neutral term for aunt/uncle, but y‚Äôall just call me by my name anyways.)  
I know some of you might not be super familiar with trans/non-binary identities, so if you have any questions at all (even if you worry they sound silly), please feel free to ask them! I‚Äôd also appreciate if y‚Äôall could let me know if you‚Äôve seen this by messaging me/commenting/reacting or something, just so I know who knows.  
Thank you for reading this, sorry for the essay! This is something really important to me, and because it‚Äôs so important, it‚Äôs taken me a long time to build up the courage to tell the people I care about the most, but I‚Äôm ready now to stop pretending to be something I‚Äôm not.  
Lots of love &lt;3

p.s., the deadname bit isn't gonna be like that - I'm trying to come out in baby steps and I want to give my family more time to get used to my gender identity before I start talking about changing my name, so for now I'm keeping my name as it is until I've had more time to try out/get comfortable with the name I've chosen.

For 6 months she has really struggled with my gender identity, from excepting my personal identity to even understating gender as a social construct. Recently we had a break through where I explained that I didn‚Äôt care if she used he or they pronouns but I needed her to accept the existence of my gender as non binary. She accepted almost immediately. She said she saw me as that person. But since then she has used masculine terms like handsome or my boy (meant to be positive) that make me uncomfortable. I really want to tell her I just want to use ‚Äúthey‚Äù pronouns. I know I should do this. It shouldn‚Äôt be a question. But we are both abroad for four months and I know this will be a huge conservation. As bad as it sounds I don‚Äôt want to upset her and make a mess out of this with out the proximity to each other.

Recently we had a break through where I explained that I didn‚Äôt care if she used he or they pronouns but I needed her to accept the existence of my gender as non binary. She accepted almost immediately. She said she saw me as that person. But since then she has used masculine terms like handsome or my boy (meant to be positive) that make me uncomfortable.

I came out to my parents last month (via email, we don't live nearby), basically ""Hi, I'm agender and use they/them pronouns, here's approximately what that means, here are some links. Please start using the correct pronouns even when I'm not around"". And I included some very basic links:

http://cassolotl.tumblr.com/post/168336693365 (I send this to everyone, it's great)

Response from parents was very good, all ""we support you and love you unconditionally"". Great!

Fast forward a month, parents are visiting me for the weekend. (This is why I came out to them when I did.) They have not been practising, there's ""she"" and ""her"" and ""daughter"" all over the place, and reminders only seemed to stick for like 10 minutes before they slid straight back into the wrong pronouns. Not great!

I sent them a message after they left to express my disappointment and remind them that correct pronouns are not optional. Their response was... baffling. As far as I can tell, it boils down to:

1) They thought it would be easier to switch pronouns when they were here with me, so didn't bother for the previous month.
2) They seem to think I want to eliminate all gendered pronouns for everyone everywhere. Literally, they said, ""Is the intention to phase out she/he/him/her entirely or are there circumstances where they remain appropriate? e.g. perhaps discussion of the merits of burqa/niqab wearing which is pretty gender specific"".

(I have no link to Islam and don't wear any sort of head or face covering.)

What.

Leaving aside for a minute how we got from me being agender to talking about burqas... how incurious and disinterested do you have to be to misunderstand things that completely? nbd, just their child's entire identity, no need to do any asking or googling or thinking. The ""changing pronouns feels awkward at first, but gets easier with practice"" in particular was very heavily emphasised in my first email and in the links.

So, um... what do I tell them now? They're good people, pretty liberal, just... old? fairly sheltered? convinced they can't understand the modern world so why try? 

Has anyone found any links or resources that work well for older generations? I know the generation gap can be so huge sometimes that what seems perfectly clear to younger people is incomprehensible to people in their 60s.

It is I, another person who isn't sure if they're cis, and I'd like to talk to some nonbinary folks to see if I can find a place I belong.

I've been into cosplaying androgynous/NB people since I was in high school, so expressing myself through costumes isn't new to me. I just never really considered myself (like my essence I guess?) to be either male or female, despite having a female body. I know I'm not trans, although I did wonder if I was back in high school. I think I decided I liked my body to make any hormonal changes (this would have never been okay in my house anyway.)  


I feel like I also may not ""get"" to be non-binary. I'm bisexual and married to a cis man. I'm pretty female presenting. I'm pear shaped. I don't feel like I look good in masculine clothing because of my hips, so I usually just opt feminine fashion. My daily is a t-shirt and jeans. I also have fibromyalgia, so expressing myself though dressing up isn't always an option.

As an experiment, I put ""she/her/they/them ok!"" in my Twitter profile and it felt good.  


I recently went on a trip with someone who used all pronouns and wore a packer when they felt like it. I was kind of jealous. My trans friend told me that jealousy/envy of others is a big tell in her community.

Last night, I had a dream that I was pointing to where I belonged on a spectrum and I was in between female and neutral.  


Since then, it feels like I have a squirming snake in my chest.

I'm sorry, this is mostly word vomit. I'm just trying to figure things out.   


Am I okay? Do I belong? Do I ""get"" to be non-binary, or does it sound like I don't really fit?

After a lot of researching ive decided (or at least heavily considering) that once my life is more suitable for a second puberty, ill talk to a therapist and go on T. Theres so much of T i want, but also things from E i wish to keep. I decided to take a closer look on detransitioning, and the permanent things from T and the ""returning"" things from E seem *exactly* like what id want from a transition. Im fine with my fat distribuition, with my boobs, im even fine with menses, but i want a deeper voice and facial/body hair (also the changes that go down there are very attractive, too)  


I dont think this is about transitioning just to detransition after, its more an unusual transition process.

I might even not stop it, but thats up to my future self to know which dominant hormone makes me feel better.

I've been figuring out gender stuff for a short while, possibly about a year at this point. I've more or less always been a very butch person, but went through a long awkward femme phase in college, when I met my current partner of 8 years. We just celebrated our 4th wedding anniversary in July.

This last June I tearfully came out as trans, though I'm still figuring out if I want to ever pursue HRT, I know that I definitely want top surgery. Any time I bring it up, though, he's incredibly evasive and tells me he doesn't want me to have it done, and that he's not sure he'll still be attracted to me.

Nothing I say seems to make sense to him, and any time we talk about it it ends in a fight or us not speaking to each other. I'm really at a loss.

Some background: He's been going to therapy the last few months (his therapist is a transman, for the record) and still refers to me as ""she"" and my birth name, while my roommates do not. Additionally, he immigrated to America to be with me. His excuse of ""I don't want you to change"" seems ridiculous to me since we've both changed plenty over 8 years, and being afraid of change at all after moving 4,000 miles seems a bit ridiculous.

My name is Ezra Morris and I am a graduate student from the psychology department at Towson University. I am writing to invite you to participate in a research study about the subtle positive and negative messages received during therapy/counseling as experienced by those with a gender identity that differs from which they were assigned at birth.

If you decide to participate in this study, you will be asked to recount both subtle positive and negative experiences that you have had in therapy/counseling because of your gender identity. Contact information for emotional support services will be provided at the end of the survey, should you need them.

In order to participate, you must be at least 18 years of age and have a gender identity that does not match that of which you were assigned at birth. In addition, you must have attended therapy/counseling within the last 5 years while identifying as a gender (or lack thereof) that does not match that of which you were assigned at birth, or while exploring your gender identity. Your gender identity does NOT have to be the reason for/focus of your attendance.

Participation is completely voluntary and should take about 10 minutes to complete. If you have any questions about the study, please contact me at [kmorri27@students.towson.edu](mailto:kmorri27@students.towson.edu), message me here, or leave a comment. This study has received approval by the institutional review board at Towson University.

2018-09-13 19:20:32,9fkz45,7,19,"Hey there, I am sorry but I will have to vent about the political situation in Germany right now (which is where I live). 
I am frustrated because of the current situation im the Hambacher Forst. If you haven't heard of it, it is basically a forest which is on a property that has been owned by a coal mining company (RWE) for more than 40 years, and when they aquired it coal was huge and tjey got a contract about owning the entire territory. They have already cut down most of the forest and turned into a huge hole. They have also forced residents in several villages around the forest to move. They gave them housing elsewhere, but still, their home is destroyed, and the government allows this because, well, coal money. The forest is very old and beautiful and there are plant and animal species in it who are threatened to go extinct. So some activists have been occuopying the remains of the forest for 6 years now, to protect it. They live in tree houses and the forest has become a space for all sorts of people where they can just exist, teach each other skills, discuss, sing and live in peace. Also there are a lot of nonbinary people there, since the community is so accepting. But now the government has ordered the police to evict everyone and destroy the tree houses. For more than two weeks now, the whole territory was circled by police and people were randomly searched for ""dangerous items"" such as brushes, ropes and fire extinguishers. (actual examples of what was confiscated). There was a lot of fake news on the media too, some of which was corrected. They maintained things like that activists had erected burning barricades, or that they had dug a tunnel system from which they were to attack police when the forest is evicted. This was complete bs and made up to make the activists look dangerous and crazy.
Yesterday, the government ordered the police to chase everyone out, for ""fire safety reasons"". After taking away their fire extinguishers. Today a lot of activists were already escorted out. Tree houses were destroyed and the first trees were cut down. 
It just makes me so sad. The people who live there have created something so beautiful. It was experimental, peaceful, accepting, and a lot of people got to live as their true self there. They created fascinating art there, tree houses, taught each other life skills. It was so nice and nothing like the image the media paints of it. It makes me so angry that we don't get to live as ourselves in our day-to-day lives. This was a place of freedom. Why does the government not see that this is very important to a lot of people? There are big rallies against it every day now, people are protesting all over Germany. It is not even clear yet if RWE will be allowed to mine and burn the coal because there are several lawsuits going on. 
I am just so sad and frustrated that this is taken away from us and from the planet. Having been there a lot, I can not stop wondering what life could be like if everyone could live as accepting and caring as these environment activists. The government could force RWE to close all the coal plants because they are older than 25 years and therefore unsafe. But no. Coal profits are more important that humans, the environment, and the beautiful community that has existed there for 6 years now. And God forbid the people experience what it is like to live a life of freedom and acceptance.

That said I've lived my whole life (I'm 28) as a woman (using my birth name and she pronouns) who is generally just occasionally assumed to be a butch lesbian when I'm actually dressed more neutral. 

Anyway, that's my background. I'm married. Happily, so happily, to a cis man (as, despite some people's assumptions, I'm actually pretty much interested in exclusively male partners, regardless of which way my gender swings). I've been with him for 9.5 years, married for the last 4. He's generally an open-minded person. We have talked a little about hypothetical situations. Like when a mutual friend came out as trans ftm, I casually asked what he'd do if I came to that realization. He said he'd support me, he'd love me, but that he's just not sexually attracted to men. Which is fully understandable. Because of that conversation I both am and am not terrified to come out as non-binary to him. I've broken down in tears twice while sitting there with him trying to figure out how to tell him and how to explain what's going on with me. I don't fully have the answers myself yet, so I'm not sure what to say besides, ""hey, I'm non-binary""...

I have to tell him. I do. I love him and even though I don't have all my answers, I do feel he deserves the truth. And part of me feels like he'll be totally okay with it, but the other part of me is terrified and keeps trying to convince myself I don't have to tell him because I don't know that I'd want to change my name and I don't despise being called she (though they sounds most true to me in my head and sometimes he sounds just as valid as she).

TL;DR: I'm a trainwreck emotionally because I can't sort how to tell my partner that I'm non-binary.

""It's weird to look at old pictures. At this point I can recognize that I looked conventionally ""pretty"" and in some ways miss that, but I also know that when I was younger I felt so miserable in my body and detached from it.

My body was my enemy and I never felt good enough, and no matter how I dressed or how much makeup I wore, I felt like my body was betraying the way I felt inside. I always wanted to be ""one of the guys"" and I ""wasn't like other girls."" I wanted to fit in but I also felt like I never would.

It's wild how different I feel now. 90% of the time I'm completely comfortable with myself and I like the way I look. I don't care what other people think of my appearance. I never thought I would be able to acheive that when I was younger. I always thought I would finally be happy with myself if I was thinner, prettier, if my skin was a little clearer, etc.

Now I recognize that most of my feelings stemmed from physical and social dysphoria. I didn't feel like ""other girls"" because I'm not a girl. I didn't ""fit in with the boys"" because I'm not a guy. I identify as nonbinary and use ""they/them/theirs"" pronouns instead of ""she/her/hers"" or ""he/him/his."" Some of you may already know or may have guessed, but I've never made a formal announcement because it makes me nervous. Most media and public perception about nonbinary people is negative.

I've felt this way for many years. I remember wishing I was born a boy when I was around 8. I used to pray before bed that I could wake up a boy. It doesn't have anything to do with my interests, my appearance, or who I'm attracted to, just the way I innately feel. Now that there are more resources around gender identity, I've realized that ""man"" doesn't fit as much as ""woman"" doesn't fit. I am nonbinary.

Anyway, I didn't intend for this to be a long or dramatic post. I've been mulling over posting for a while (like 2-3 years while) and feel like there's no real point in waiting anymore.

Sorry if it's a bit of a mess. 

I believe myself to be somewhat rational, for the most part.

I was born a female. I know what's down there.
I was always a bit of a tomboy. This doesn't affect your gender, yes, but I still believe it to be an important piece of evidence.

At age 11-12, I can't pin down an exact point, I started to question myself. Mainly, my femininity. I didn't like being a girl. I never was into the ""normal"" female things. Being a male felt more natural, but still a bit off. After a bit of research, I learned of being non-binary, specifically, to be neither gender. Finally, I found something that felt right.

Now, I know that just because I wasn't a girly-girl isn't grounds for transitioning, my feelings went beyond that. When I was called she, it made my chest feel tight. Wearing feminine clothes was about the most uncomfortable thing I could do. 
Months later, I finally convinced my mother to let me get a shorter haircut, and it was as if a piece of me had been restored. I started wearing more neutral/male leaning clothes, and I felt better.

Though outwardly I did all this, I was still in the closet. I had told my mother, but we more or less swept it under the rug. She still used my birth name and pronouns. I didn't mind, as I felt coming out at such a young age was a bad idea. I at least had the insight to know that it could have been just a phase. 

Fast forward to age 15. I had been living with these thoughts of transitioning for nearly 3-4 years. It nearly drove me mad. I was stuck. I dressed neutral, had a short haircut, and strangers even called me by male pronouns or neutral they/them. It was nice, but I wanted more. I wanted people to call me they/them, and I wanted to be called by a different name. 
I can say for sure I wasn't an SJW. Even online, if people referred to me as a female, I didn't go nuts. I felt mature enough to handle being transgender, but I had no clue how to come out to my peers, the rest of my family, and to have my mother be on board. 

I asked to get counseling. I assumed it would help me by either letting me live with these feelings, make them go away, or to help me come out.
Needless to say, it didn't. 
While my counselor was a lovely woman, she basically told me to just find peace where I was. I had been where I was for 4 years. There was no hope of peace.

Fast forward again, into highschool. Everyone knew something was up. Substitutes called me 'sir', people saw the way I dressed. It was hard to keep quiet. I was so close to having my secret out, it just needed to be confirmed. Still, my mother and I never discussed it, and when we did, she always told me to keep it in.

Now, at age 17, living with this for 6 years, I'm ready to come out.
I want to be known as they/them (though if people referred to me as a female, it wouldn't bug me. I just want to come out of the closet.)

Here, though, if my question.
Should I come out?
Is being non-binary something bad? I hear the term 'special snowflake' a lot.
How should I go about this? How do I live with this?

I never want children, I've got a history of having been on the pill to deal with painful periods... but it's my understanding that at least for non ftm people, a doc is probably not going to say ""sure I'll take away the thing that makes you menstruate"" in any fashion that is covered by insurance. I'm in the US, if that has any bearing on your advice.  


Side note, I came out to my spouse (cis-male) last night and it went really well and he was super supportive and I bawled my eyes out from how relieved I felt after keeping this pent up inside for so many years and being so worried how he'd react.

I never want children, I\'ve got a history of having been on the pill to deal with painful periods... but it\'s my understanding that at least for non ftm people, a doc is probably not going to say ""sure I\'ll take away the thing that makes you menstruate"" in any fashion that is covered by insurance. I\'m in the US, if that has any bearing on your advice.  \n\n\nSide note, I came out to my spouse (cis-male) last night and it went really well and he was super supportive and I bawled my eyes out from how relieved I felt after keeping this pent up inside for so many years and being so worried how he\'d react. (He\'s a pretty open-minded guy, but a convo or two from the past left me worried he might not be that level of open.) I have a pretty conservative religious upbringing so as a teen that felt like I didn\'t quite... fit... into a binary label I didn\'t really have anywhere to look or go with those feelings.

One of the club members that I have written about in the story, lets call them 'Dan', has been out as non binary for 6 months or so. I have spoken to them before about it, and when I did Dan was still called Diane and when I asked about their pronouns they said: 'use 'she' or 'he', it doesn't really matter to me.' and because I was used to calling them 'she' and 'her', I continued to do so, although occasionally not correcting myself when I would use male pronouns and I noticed they appreciate that. I did use 'she' and 'her' in the story.  


Two weeks ago, I heard that Dan had changed their name. So that has changed, and I am anxious whether their preferred pronouns have changed also. But we don't speak one on one, so I would have to send a message in which I ask for pronouns. Would that be okay?

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that has complicated this issue is that I'm genderfluid myself but not out and still figuring things out, so I might have been overthinking this a LOT. I also have a good friend that is a transman that I do talk to regularly, but I don't even dare to ask him because the reason why I cannot be casual with this is that it is a heavy subject for myself also. For me personally, 'he' and 'his' pronouns feel less heavily gendered than 'she' and 'her'. But I think that is probably in my head because of MY situation which could very well be not the case for Dan.

I don't ever want to have a ""coming out"" because well I just personally hate the concept that you must announce to everyone what you are because it makes me feel not normal as well as it makes me anxious to put myself into the center of attention. 

&amp;#x200B;

My partner said that the roommate of his friend lets call Doug, said it was ""fucking retarded"" for me to do that. I think Doug did his best to defend me, but he sometimes is not good in confrontational situations. I can avoid this person because we really aren't close besides the connection that he lives with Doug, but its really hard to get out of my head as they keep interacting with my instagram posts since. 

&amp;#x200B;

Someone else in my partner's friend group, lets call her Samantha, is much more conservative and has been outspoken about their political stance with gender issues. That political stance is that it is bullshit pretty much. Samantha has a trans roommate and has never been respectful of their pronouns, so I wasn't surprised she took note. Samantha texted another more conservative friend in the group, lets call them Mack. Mack usually is disrespectful of people's pronouns, but has been behind on a number of issues but always grows and learns when his friends educate him. Mack told my partner how samantha texted him immediately after my post to ask what he thought. Mack was amazing and said he didnt give a fuck. He asked my partner about the extent of my they/them pronoun use and the rest of the night used my pronouns. 

&amp;#x200B;

This girl samantha tho, i saw her the day after I posted using my pronouns. She was so nice. I think she still genuinely likes me, but I'm so paranoid about her talking about me. I hate the idea of people discussing me at all. It makes me so anxious.

My partner made a weird statement about how she can still respect me and see me as a person while still being confused about how someone can be non-binary, as he thinks its an internal struggle with herself seeing people be comfortable with who they are when she often doesn't seem to be. I don't want to make judgements or assumptions about another person's inner struggles, and at surface value I don't feel respected at all by her.

I‚Äôve come to realize a lot of fears such as getting too much breast growth have gone away the more I thought about things. Pros of HRT def outweigh the cons for me.

At this point I'm excited about almost every aspect of feminization that comes from HRT...but there is one thing I keep getting stuck up on the closer I get to transition. I have this fear that my face will be so feminine I will *always boyfail. I still identify as male but I feel right when I'm extremely androgynous with a leaning to the fem side. 

Anyway. Looking for hrt experiences of AMAB nb folk and ofc if anyone went through this same fear how did things turn out etc? Did you face change a lot, a little? How did you navigate things if it did turn too feminine.

2018-09-20 03:35:53,9hbxfq,16,6,"Hello everyone. I am (currently identified as) non-binary and also a linguist and writer. So, pronouns are very, very interesting to me. English ""lacks"" a third-person singular pronoun, or so we've all heard. Many neopronouns have been proposed (and some people like them) but a lot of people have taken to using ""they"", as ""they"" as a third person singular pronoun standing in for someone who's gender is unknown or ambiguous is already unconsciously in general usage, no matter how much prescriptivists like to deny it.

""They"" is all well and good. I like ""they"". However I was reading a book with two non-gendered protagonists and it did become confusing as to whether both of the protagonists were being talked about, and if it was only one, which one. We can chalk some of this up to poor editing but it is still a unique problem to the usage of ""they"" as a personal pronoun and one we're probably going to run into as more and more people assert themselves as non-binary and choose to use ""they"".

And that is the pronoun ""one"". Even though it's labeled as a third person singular pronoun its usage is currently entirely impersonal... when using ""one"", one is generally talking about a hypothetical non-gendered person and in informal settings you'd likely default to using ""you"" for this hypothetical person.

2018-09-20 15:31:52,9hg95r,6,6,"So I'll preface this by saying I'm cis-gendered and prefer she/her pronouns. 

Basically I'm building a non-bullshit (for lack of a better term) fantasy world to write stories and possibly a novel about. The original concept a White Boy came up with for a d&amp;d campaign and it was awash with your typical patriarchal bullshit like rape and power-amassing villains, etc. The campaign fell apart quickly due to the aforementioned White Boy's incompetence. I ended up doing a lot of the work on the actual world building, so when all was said and done I still had this outline for a world that I felt had a lot of potential. So I stripped out everything I didn't like and thought about what I would want my ""ideal"" world to look like, and a lot of it kept coming back to getting rid of things like the gender binary, toxic- masculinity and monogamy as well as rape culture. First and foremost, everyone has autonomy over their own bodies, both to eliminate rape as a widely accepted occurrence (example: half-orcs)  and letting women chose who / when / or even if they procreate. By default, those who can procreate often end up in positions of power because they wield the most important power of all, the literal power of life. Also, sex work is and has always been a thing, it's literally the oldest profession so it's going to be in my world, but of course their work isn't illegal or frowned upon.  

&amp;#x200B;

One of the ideas I had was never referring to any of the children or babies with genders or pronouns, and was thinking there would be some sort of ""coming of age"" ceremony where perhaps they would pick a gender / name, etc. I would also like to enter the ""two-spirit"" concept into my world, and one of the main characters is a non-binary half-orc. BUT I am trying to be consciously aware not to rip cultural stuff from Native Americans, since I keep coming back to some of these things in their culture I think just make sense for my world, especially in the further out villages where community is very important. 

&amp;#x200B;

The hardest part is obviously the ""show not tell"" reveal; as in when my characters interact what are the societal norms established in a non-binary world? Would you ask pronouns right away or in a non-binary world would pronouns even be a thing? Would literally everyone just be referred to as ""they""?? What about gendering animals?  ARGH. it's seriously making me crazy how freaking gendered everything is in my head and it's massively bogging down my writing. for example, gods / goddesses exist in the world's pantheon, but am aware these are very gendered terms. I thought of just referring to all of them as gods, but honestly I like the word 'goddess' so much and would like for that to mean something as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also looking for gender neutral terms I can use. I only have a few things I've already decided I like; ""Ser"" instead of ""sir"" (and in this case it refers to military rank, not gender) and would like to use the term ""folx"" as a catch all phrase to address groups of people. Are there any other typically gendered terms that you have a better word for?? Like I've seen 'fortify' instead of man-up, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay I'm probably rambling and I still feel like I've done a poor job trying to explain why I'm posting on here. Basically I just want to touch base with some non-binary people and ask if there is anything else I should be thinking about making sure I do or don't do.

ARGH. it\'s seriously making me crazy how freaking gendered everything is in my head and it\'s massively bogging down my writing. for example, gods / goddesses exist in the world\'s pantheon, but am aware these are very gendered terms. I thought of just referring to all of them as gods, but honestly I like the word \'goddess\' so much and would like for that to mean something as well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\'m also looking for gender neutral terms I can use. I only have a few things I\'ve already decided I like; ""Ser"" instead of ""sir"" (and in this case it refers to military rank, not gender) and would like to use the term ""folx"" as a catch all phrase to address groups of people. Are there any other typically gendered terms that you have a better word for?? Like I\'ve seen \'fortify\' instead of man-up, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay I\'m probably rambling and I still feel like I\'ve done a poor job trying to explain why I\'m posting on here. Basically I just want to touch base with some non-binary people and ask if there is anything else I should be thinking about making sure I do or don\'t do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'writing a non-binary world / suggestions for language, words, concepts, etc', 'created': 1537482712.0}"

2018-09-22 20:13:40,9i2ozi,13,41,"Hey y'all,

Heads up, this is going to get long and ranty. So. One of the things that's most frustrating for me in my transitioning process is that I can't for the life of me decide whether I want to try/start HRT or not. I've been back and forth all the time every day for over a year on it now. And I feel like one of the factors that exacerbates the problem the most, and makes me feel even crazier, is how incredibly few examples there are in pop culture of nonbinary AMAB artists or celebrities who are known for something other than queer/trans/gender activism but are vocal about being nonbinary, compared to AFAB celebrities who fit the same description.

For most of my life I really didn't give two shits about pop culture, and obviously it all should be taken with a heaping dose of salt, but it feels bleak and frustrating to me how clear the message seems to be that if you ""choose"" an identity-path that means throwing away power and privilege rather than gaining it, then there will be no place for you in society as far as the people who hold power over our biggest cultural-media industries are concerned. It's striking to me that with the recent wave of celebrities regarded by the public eye as ""women"" who have come forward about there nonbinary identities, there has been no parallel wave among public figures who are treated as ""men.""

I don't like that talking about public perception means I have to divide people based on their birth-assigned gender just because other people do, but I feel like that's unfortunately the clearest way to get at what I'm trying to say. In the AFAB camp you've got actors like Ruby Rose, Amandla Stenberg, and Asia Kate Dillon, all of whom have talked publicly about their gender identities; musicians like Angel Haze and Miley Cyrus who have done the same; also musicians like St. Vincent and Grimes, who haven't been quite as clear-cut in their language about themselves as persons but have talked about seeking gender-neutral or -ambiguous or -fluid spaces in/through their work.

And then in the AMAB camp you've got... Eddie Izzard. Who is endlessly endearing and whose comedy I adored in high school, but he is fifty-six entire years old and comes from another time. I guess Sam Smith, based on a single comment he made a year or so back? Shamir. Shamir, along with Sam Smith, is more on the same vibe with St. Vincent and Grimes, I suppose, in that they've essentially voiced how deeply *not* important gender is to their work. Whereas Eddie Izzard is more of an Amandla or an Asia. But he is not young like those latter two, who are, significantly, super duper young. And whereas there are more public figures I left off the AFAB list, these three AMAB people are literally the only ones I can think of.

I don't doubt that young artists who are unapologetically vocal about their nonbinary identities and happen to have been AMAB are out there doing great work, but it seems like their industries won't reward them in the same way, because their paths don't fit into marketable pop-pseudo-feminist narratives of (*ble**ughhh here it comes...*) ""female"" ""empowerment."" So I guess my question is, whose work should I be paying attention to? What young, creative minds are putting art out there that's worthy of the top of the industry but isn't getting the reach it could have because of who made it?

All this said, the visibility of nonbinary people who *have* gone on HRT (and, again, are known primarily for something other than gender activism or queer activism) is of course even less, regardless of GAAB. I feel like in broad strokes the same principle is operating here ‚Äî in the mainstream reading of it, ""changing"" your gender means you're throwing away your inborn/God-given power or potential and that's something not to be desired ‚Äî but this could be a subject for a whole other post and isn't really what I'm trying to get into right now.

Basically, in trying to feel out what I want for myself in my own transition, I feel perpetually thrown off by the dearth of examples or role models to look to who have taken a path I'm considering. It's not that I'm interested in copying anybody else's journey. I just have found myself relating strongly to nonbinary celebrities when they talk about their gender identity as something that *is* significant to them ‚Äî but, except for one who is old enough to be my parent, none of those people have come from the type of upbringing I've come from. It's disheartening. It just is.

IDK, am I wrong? Do I have a confirmation bias someone can call me out on? Where the fuck are we??

I never got to have therapy and therefore HRT, so I'm still stuck with this male body. For a while after I broke up with my ex, due to literally feeling imprisoned by the ""female role"" I had in the relationship, I thought I was asexual, but I am definitely still sexually attracted to females...or maybe I'm just jealous? Maybe it's part of the dysphoria I keep feeling? But even when I'm alone with him, free to be me, with no mask, I don't really feel female ""enough"" either to consider myself that. But I'd absolutely love to wear the female clothes he and I bought for me over the last few years.

I don't know what I wanna be once I get to break out of my shell... I'm too old to be a girl, to tall to still be cute compared to my ridiculous standards of what I love about female bodies... I can't even figure out who my ideal partner would be, for me to ever consider trying a relationship. I think I need someone more dominant, who'd push me towards actually working on changing things for the better and could help me with body care, make up and such. I've been daydreaming about that a bit, I think I might even consider them my owner if they let me live as their catgirl.

Is it wrong that I could have sex with a female, but hate my dick otherwise? Maybe that's just these stupid hormones telling me that I want sex, when I tried it with him that just satisfied my curiousity pretty much forever, so it might be that all over again, just with maybe a bit more to explore? Idk, I'm not cutting my claws tho... ~~and I'm a stupid pillow princess with back pain as an excuse~~

Not that I know how to get out of this limbo state I'm in, I literally wouldn't know the words to say even if I managed to find and call a new therapist and my mom can't get a hold of the only one who ever seriously talked to me without any bias (and therefore applying their experience to me, which just doesn't work like that). I just can't deal with stuff alone and nobody's here to help me, especially once my ex goes back home next week ;-;

I wish I could just buy a new body, maybe even with cat ears and no disgusting body hair...this one got ruined by growth hormone therapy beta testing anyways, boobs would probably make the back pain even worse...ugh...but being able to pass as female would make wearing female clothes much easier and that's what I really want right now, I think. Maybe actually having a female body would allow me to feel something gender-related again. For now I mostly feel nothing and can't describe what I feel when I'm with him, but it *is* something...

Usually I'd also be crying for attention and hugs, headpats and such, but my ex is here and happy to provide me that...even tho I secretly feel like an asshole for basically using him for that, even tho we broke up.

I haven't even directly mentioned my anxieties (spelling?) about a lot of these things. One big issue I have are my grandparents who I usually see every day, but I feel like they wouldn't understand, my grandpa is already annoyed at my long hair that I've had for years (inb4 r/egg_irl) and my claws... but it's all I have, I'm not happy with my legs and keep losing the war against this stupid body hair...especially if I keep randomly falling back into not doing anything anymore and becoming nocturnal again.

Long story short : still live with parents, bought a binder, eventually parent found out, threw out my binder, several months after many, many, talks with parent, they've decided that if i lose weight then i can have permission with my own money to buy a binder. Situation still a bit shitty, but hey i take what i can get. 

Issue though is having to wait until ive lost enough weight that they can deem i can have a binder, because theyre convinced i only have dysphoria because im fat. Which im not gonna deny, i am fat. Ive actually lost 9 pounds now. But im still having heavy chest dysphoria, and my biggest fear is that if i do get another binder, my chest will still show. My other binder didnt hide all my chest, but it did cut down my dysphoria, and i dont know why, but im afraid im going to lose weight and still be able to see my chest with a binder and still be uncomfortable with myself. 

Additionally, bottom dysphoria sucks too. I dont get it as often, but damn it *sucks*. And it confuses the fuck out of me too. Like with chest dysphoria i know that i actually want no chest, and one day i wanna get top surgery. Ive thought about it a lot (well kinda half to when its always on your mind) and ive read up a lot of the subject, ive never felt comfortable with my chest, and i know about my feeling about my chest. 

But bottom dysphoria really fucks up my head. Like everything down there just starts to feel so foreign and wrong, so whats the opposite to that? Do i want a penis? Do i want a vagina? Why cant i have neither? Fuck. Its like everything downstairs just shouldn't be.

Looking into getting another fan for my room tho. 

Dysphoria also fucks me over with all these questions. Like i know i dont want to be a girl, but does that necessarily mean i want to be a dude?

It's currently a very stressful and confusing time in my life as I'm sure it is for most of us here. I've found myself alone and confused in London starting my university course, working part time, and also trying to figure out my gender identity.

It's taken me years to admit to myself that I've been living a lie, and now that I am at least seeking professional help I feel like the person I want to be isn't just a dream anymore.

However life is never straightforward and I've learnt that I'm likely going to be waiting for 18-24 months till I get my first appointment with the gender identity clinic in London. With my disphoria growing all the time and feeling like the world could come crashing down on me at any moment, I'm not sure that's a wait I can handle.

But what can I do? There's only two clinics in the whole country and I have to be seen by them before they'll prescribe me hormones &gt;_&lt;

So my question for anyone willing to answer is. What are my options, do any of you know ways to speed up or divert this process? Or if not, ways to help me get through this wait?

My issues stem from dating a trans/non-binary person who was mentally and emotionally abusive and who I later found out had BPD. The other being a friend I developed later on who identified as non-binary but  constantly put me down for being born as a man and how emotional and feminine I am ironically enough even though I am evidently heavily androgynous and non-binary as most average people have a hard time telling whether I am a man or a woman. My main goal would be that I would like to have a positive relationship with a person that I could identify with on things I normally can't but fear the negative outcome it might have on my own self image and my mental and emotional state as I have been diagnosed with Complex-PTSD. I appreciate any advice.

Hey everyone, this is my first post to this sub. I realized I was NB about a year ago, and it's been a really positive discovery on my life, but I'm still very much struggling on how to present myself. I'm mostly out, but not to everyone and especially not to family/faculty/etc. So right now I'm still presenting masculine, but I want to start changing that.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the issues I've been facing is that, while I really dislike ""men's"" clothing (as in, clothes you find in the men's section at a store) and find it boring and restrictive, I'm not comfortable wearing ""women's"" clothing either (excluding basics like jeans, shirts, hoodies; I more mean dresses, skirts, etc.), and I really can't find an in-between. I've searched in vain for inspiration around the web, but what I'm finding all seems pretty redundant: hats, vests, ties/bow ties, denim jackets; nothing feels like my style and everything in general feels too masc.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm running into a specific issue in the last few days: My college is having a large formal dance event next month, and I'm determined to find a formal outfit that isn't a suit or tux. But when I look online, all I find is vests, ties, and suit pants; everything once again feels way too masc. It's also not helping my dysphoria at all: the images that come up when I search for NB formal wear are people wearing suits that have softer face features than I do. It's making me feel really stuck in how I present.

&amp;#x200B;

This is mostly just a rant I guess, but I do have a question for anyone who feels like they've been in a similar place. Does anyone have advice for clothes/styles that don't seem to be on any spectrum, and are just truly androgynous? Outside of basic jeans, shirts (which is all I feel comfortable wearing right now), has anyone found clothes that, in your perspective, really don't feel masculine or feminine, but just feel like their own thing? Especially for formal wear, I would love to find something that is really unique, even if it means that it looks like runway art-fashion. Any advice is welcome.

2018-09-24 20:05:23,9ilc44,3,4,"Hello fellow enbies,

This will be long and rambly and propably trigger people with eating disorders, so be warned.

I have recently realized I am nb (although it was pretty obvious, but I took long to come to terms with it. I have been dressing and behaving very androgynously all my life, and never felt like I fit right in with either girls or boys; back when I was 11 my peers called me 'neutral' and my mom forced me to get my ears pierced so I would be reckognized as female, so there we go, rambling already.)

Now some things just make perfect sense to me, which did not make sense before. There is one particular aspect of my life which I am very ashamed of and that is my obsession with my body fat. 

Which never made sense to me. Like, WHY do I feel so uncomfortable with having fat on my body, when body fat doesn't make other people look unattractive to me? I am bisexual and I have just always LOVED curvy, chubby, feminine girls, they are so beautiful. And guys, too. A big cuddly guy with a soft tummy to cuddle? HELL yeah. 
So why the FUCK am I so obsessed with my own body fat? Why the fuck am I SO uncomfortable if I even gain a bit of weight? I have always felt ashamed of that. Like, I felt like it makes me so shallow and like a hypocrite when I told others to not worry about being thin. But it is not the same thing. I just can't stand my hips and breasts because I do not want to be seen as feminine or even female. If I saw another person with my exact figure, I would see them as a very attractive female, but I am not a female so I don't feel comfortable with that.  

The only way for me to feel comfortable and confident in my body is to restrict my food intake and to and train A LOT so I don't have a lot of body fat. (and also, to have visible muscles. I love having defined muscles). Again, I do NOT hold anyone else up to that standard, and I find other people way more attractive when they are soft and chubby rather that thin and muscular. But somehow when it is ME I am looking at, I have a completely different set of ""beauty standards"".


At least I know now why that is, right? Because my fat distribution makes me feel dysphoric af and I prefer myself as  a non-genderable stick with a bit of badass muscle?


But how do I overcome that though? This is SO exhausting! I don't want to live like that for the rest of my life? I can only maintain a figure I am comfortable with if I seriously restrict my eating and train a lot, but I can not always do that. Right now I am in a stressful situation, and I need all my brain power, so I can not afford to not eat (makes me have a hard time concentrating). Also, I have been sick for nearly 2 weeks now and could not exercise. I NEED to become healthy right now, or else I will fuck up my exams. So I eat. A lot, in my mind, even though I know it is actually a healthy amount of food. But this means I am heavier than normal, and I hate that so much. Unfortunately, maintaining the body I feel comfortable with takes so much time and discipline, and I have to sacrifice my health, my well-being, my sleep for it. I can not go on like that. What do I do now?

Anyway. since I was a little kid I preferred boy toys over girl toys. My Halloween costumes were also more boyish or gender neutral. I did wear some girly costumes too though. When I was about 4, I cut all my hair off because of how uncomfortable I was. There was always an issue with caring about my looks and making myself look ""pretty"" or feminine. I hated long hair and always rejected it and just my whole appearance in general. Even before puberty, I had an issue with slouching but more so during and after puberty. I just always felt uncomfortable with my chest, I guess? Most of my friends were boys, and I traded and played Pokemon cards with them. Didn't rlly feel like I was a boy deep down, but being like ""one of the boys"" came more natural to me. I felt like I was being fake if I tried to ""act like a girl."" I was always kinda rough and tough and enjoyed wrestling boys and girls. My sexuality used to be a bit more straight-forward before I got into my teen years. I've always been attracted to females, and maybe feminine guys but not like females. I've dated girls, but always had the issue of sex and kissing. Especially, when I discovered what Transgender meant. I didn't like to show my chest or downstairs area. Now, I don't like it, but I can stand to look at myself in the mirror. I don't want others seeing it. Not because it's ""ugly"" either. My body feels wrong. I've been seeing a gender therapist for about 4 months now and she diagnosed me with gender dysphoria, anxiety, and depression. We also talked about me being nonbinary. Tbh, I've kinda embraced that identity. It feels less constricting and stressful. Since I'm not being pushed into a binary box. I'd rather be called a boy than a girl. But, full on transitioning to a man doesn't appeal to me much. The problem is, I'm not sure how to transition or what I want. I don't know how to feel comfortable. I've gotten boy haircuts, I bind, I wear boy clothes, ect. Yeah, it makes me feel better and stuff, but I just feel lost and depressed still. Heck, the physical changes from T, I don't really want either. A lot of people want their beards, genital growth, ect. Honestly, I'd just take the muscle growth, fat distribution, face shape change. The changes that are more temporary, y'know? Even the acne. Anyway, I don't pass. I'd rather pass as a boy but, I don't wanna be 100% male either. I know I can't control the T, and how fast the changes are. I know I don't need T or top surgery to be trans. That's all well and good. But, I don't know if i'm satisfied with doing nothing either, if that makes sense. I'm just really trapped because I don't rlly dig the effects on T.

2018-09-25 13:05:03,9irxpa,6,19,"I've been on T for over 2 years, had a hysto, planning on bottom surgery sometime soon. I have felt incredibly secure in my identiy since coming out, until now.

I have become somewhat obsessed with a musician who is a cis woman. I tend to do this, become obsessive over people or things. but she is the type of person I would love to be -- beautiful, artistic..I envy her voice, her appearance, her hair, her sense of style. if I were a woman, she is the type of woman I would want to be.

this is confusing to me, because I am most often attracted to men. the last time I felt any sort of attraction to a woman was years ago, and I was coming to terms with just being a gay man until I saw this musician in-person.

so I couldn't decide whether I was attracted to her, or whether I wanted to be her.

I never felt comfortable as a woman, but now I'm thinking, was it just because I thought I was unattractive? I hated my hair, the way my body looked and felt to me, although I certainly feel more comfortable being unattractive presenting as a masculine person than a woman, but often it is more societally accepted to be unattractive as a man than a woman.

thing is, this past two years since I've been on hormones have been the best two years of my life so far. I've made friends, I got a college degree, I finally feel like a human being and not a depressed blob. now I feel myself slipping back into depression.

I think part of my insecurities come from not feeling like I shouldn't have transitioned, but from feeling like if I were ever to meet this woman, she'd be repulsed by me, a tiny man. maybe what I'm feeling is internalized transphobia.

because then, when I think, what if I woke up the next morning in this woman's body? the only way I could deal with it would be if I covered it up. she tends to wear modest clothing, clothes that cover most of her body and obscure her figure. but actually being in a woman's body, that is not something I feel like I could ever deal with. the only way I could deal with being in a woman's body would be if it were, well, a more masculine woman's body, with no hips, the tiniest of boobs..

but I know my life would have been easier as a woman. even though I also know that, if I woke up in this woman's body feeling like I do now, I'd still need to transition, no matter how beautiful she is. because I couldn't deal with the bottom dysphoria or ignoring and hating my body the way I did until I realized I was trans. 

I think I've just been feeling depressed lately, and my fear of being rejected by people I admire due to the person I am is making me spiral a bit.

I am non-binary, so while I went on hormones and need surgeries to make my body feel more congruent with how I see myself in my mind, I feel now, more than ever, also more comfortable presenting in a more feminine way. pre-transition, I could never dress in feminine clothing because I felt like it accentuated the parts of my body that gave me distress. but now, I feel closer and more comfortable with my femininity than I ever could before. I feel increasing discomfort with being called ""bro"" or ""dude,"" I feel like my non-binary identity has never been acknowledged by anyone other than myself and it's causing me distress.

I needed to ramble on about this and now I feel a little better, but it'd still be nice to talk about it. I feel like I still experience a lot of negative feelings and internalized transphobia, and that I don't actually want to be this woman or any other woman. I think what I have realized is that I am not gay, I am attracted to all genders and my worry is that no one of any gender will ever find me worthy of attraction or love.

I guess i‚Äôm worried I transitioned out of hatred for who I was, although I can‚Äôt deny that no matter what, I feel much better now than I ever did before, even with these weird feelings

I'm wondering if anyone else here has ever felt this way.

I think my confusion mostly comes from feeling attracted to a woman after identifying as gay for a long time, thus bringing up old feelings of do I want to be this person, or be with them?

2018-09-27 19:26:01,9jfvrf,2,12,"i‚Äôve been unemployed for a bit and had an interview that i was excited about this morning. i‚Äôve been a little concerned about how to handle gender stuff. i am dfab, id as androgyne, and present very neutrally‚Äîi‚Äôve transitioned to cultivate a very androgynous look and i get gendered about 40-40-20 male/female/neutral by strangers, generally speaking. it helps that i‚Äôm 6‚Äù and relatively slim with a smaller chest. i‚Äôve been on hrt before so my voice is on the higher side of what people expect to be a male register (think tracy chapman - brian molko range), and i primarily get gendered as male over the phone. interviewers always think i‚Äôm male bc they hear my voice on the phone first and they‚Äôre like ‚Äúah yes a man‚Äù and then they see me irl and they‚Äôre like ‚Äúhm‚Ä¶yes that‚Äôs‚Ä¶plausibly a man‚Äù and it kind of locks into place and then idk how to correct them.

i thought i dressed pretty neutrally for my interview today and i wasn‚Äôt even binding but the guy still called me sir and he. last time this happened i just rolled with it but i hated trying to pass every day and i think also i got soft fired for being Gender Confusing. i would prefer to be out as using they pronouns but that‚Äôs not feasible in every work environment and failing that i would at least like to pass as female i guess just for the sake of not having to wear a binder every day. but if they hear me on the phone and then i show up in a skirt or whatever i‚Äôm worried about being subjected to misdirected transmisogyny and not getting hired üò•

Each of our conversations about gender so far has been either gender in general or specific things Ive been doing and if they're cool with them. Things like shopping in both mens and womens clothing, having panties and boxer briefs, and liking being called a variety of adjectives (like pretty, dashing, handsome...). Our latest conversation was me saying I wanted to start therapy to talk some of this through with a professional. Im not sure if I actually am non-binary or just gender non conforming. Do I hate being my AGAB because Im not that or because society/cultural expectations/stereotypes/assumptions suck?

His big question in response to this is ""What does being non-binary or any other gender than what they've always known me to be mean?"" And Im having a hard time answering that. Ive just ended up in loops of gender stereotypes and expectations. Their argument is that they have a hard time separating society definitions of what a gender is and innate feelings of gender.
