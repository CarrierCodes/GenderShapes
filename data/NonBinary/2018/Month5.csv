I always thought that I was never even close to ‘passing’ as male due to the 38FF chesticles I have, and my hourglass shape. It’s something I’m learning to cope with for now while I’m losing weight (30lbs down yay!) since it’s way easier to be androgynous when you reduce that pesky sex-determined fat distribution. 


Anyway - I thought anyone with eyes would clock me as a butch woman, and I’ve never even considered NOT using the women’s restrooms. I’ve used them my whole life. 


Last night my boyfriend and I went to the cinema (he’s a total peach who is supportive of my gender exploration) and I just popped into the ladies before we went in. When I came out of the cubicle to wash my hands, an older woman came out of a cubicle and just openly stared at me, jaw agape. I made eye contact with her and smiled, and she just gave me a silent look of utter horror. She left without washing her hands (gross).


I live in the UK which hasn’t had the same debate about bathroom use for trans individuals that the US has had, so it’s not on people’s minds at all. I don’t blame her for her reaction (apart from not washing your hands, that’s icky) but now I’m left thinking - what bathroom am I welcome to use? This is something I’d genuinely never worried about.

2018-05-01 22:32:36,8gcj5c,5,10,"Hi everyone. First i need to say that i dont know where to post this, so i tried to find something that is related. I am 21 born female, i live in germany. Ever since i can remember (and i remember EVERYTHING from my childhood) i never felt like i belong to ""women"", but not to men either. I felt detached, as if all this weird sex bullshit was useless and annoying. I also tend more to the ""male side"" of my family - i love art and maths like my grandpa and i love science (and art) like my father. I even LOOK 100% like my father (dark hair and eyes, the only thing from my mother is that my hair are straight). 

I feel kind of fine in my body, my boobs are small and since i am quite ugly i also dont fit into the beauty standard of women (yes it CAN be an advantage to be ugly lol). I usually wear mens tshirts bc they are more comfortable and my hair is pretty short. Optically i am good, i like how i look and dont intend to change it much. 

Theres one thing that bothers me though - reproduction and the theoretical ability to be pregnant. I am lucky that i hate children and dont want any (and that i am lesbian) because what i want more than anything is a sterilisation. Just THINKING about what is inside me makes me fucking cringe, i want to rip it out or shove something in my stomach that kills every fucking cell related to.... You know those things. I hate it. So i try to get a sterilisation. I could have asked fot a hysterectomy but i seriously dont want to hit early menopause, so i choose a sterilisation. I found a doctor and he was extremely supportive (quote: ""try to get your insurance to cover it, they have to it needs to be done!""). Issue: i am insured privately with my parents and there is NO WAY they wont know.


This is where my issue starts: my relationship with my parents isnt really bad but they lost all trust i had in them a long time ago since they never took me seriously. I always knew i NEVER wanted to marry (lesbian, gay marriage was illegal until last year i think) and that i dont want children. If i was ""lucky"" i got laughed at, if not i was ignored and yelled at to ""not talk shit and what do i even know"". They never cared much for these things (i also always wanted to move to southern europe like spain, france or italy... Guess what - they made fun of me) and i the only thing i remember is their laugh. It was my greatest fear as a child: being laughed at for my future plans.

My best friend (who is extremely supportive mostly and who does everything for me if i need help) now intervened bc my parents NEED to know my issue, so he told them. Not behind my back dont worry, but i wasnt present bc i was so scared. Since that i am really freaked out. My mom reacted almost positive (she said i will get the surgery so thats at least something) and my father idk. But the thing is, i dont trust her. AT ALL. I locked myself into my room and didnt leave since then (im in my room since yesterday). My friend even said that her reaction was ""yes i remember she said sth like that as a child but i didnt take it seriously"" - yeaaah... I figured that already. 

My friend now brought me some food in my room bc obvsly i didnt eat today. I am still pretty freaked out and i basically jusz wanted something to eat to shut up my stomach, nothing fancy like a pizza or some shit so i just told him to bring cereal. He did, but kind of thought its a good idea to make fun of me once again as in ""i would have brought you pizza but no you now want cereal and lock yourself up, typical way girls solve problems right there *HAHAHA LOOK AT ME IM SO FUNNY WOMEN ARE DUMB AND SO ARE YOU*""... Did i say he was supportive...? I just waited for ""are you on your period?"" (Im not btw, if i was he wouldnt have entered my home aka dragon cave during that week...)

Anyways now i changed from disturbed to pretty pissed and threw him out.. And now i just feel empty... I just want to never open that door and never see a living person who can make fun of me and laugh at me ever again...

I think it was the first time I realized that being assigned as a girl meant that my life would go in a different path from my friends. 

The next time I remember really rankling against my gender was in high school. I knew I was bi or gay, although I wasn't sure which (still am not), but I was co-president of my school's GSA and doing research online at the time and stumbling across the idea of genderqueer. I immediately latched onto it and did a test drive of coming out while I was at debate camp over the summer between freshman and sophomore year (summer of 2005). It went poorly because teenagers are cruel, so I buried those feelings until college. I went by my assigned name (feminine), my middle name (ambiguous gender) and Vincent on and off over the years depending on the group I was interacting with. I eventually landed on just going by my feminine name because it was easier.

For the next several years I kind of put it aside because gender identity took a major back seat to the fact that I had some other mental health and trauma that needed to be processed before I could deal with those questions. But then I got help, and my brain had the capacity to start thinking about gender again.

Now when I'm in spaces and I have to identify my pronouns and I use she/her/hers sometimes I feel neutral about it, and other times I feel physically wrong as the words come out of my mouth. I was listening to a friend who is trans the other night about new pronouns, and she mentioned ve/ver/vis and those felt immediately right to me in a way I can't articulate. I feel like I need to start reexamining my gender for my own mental health, and nonbinary with non they/them/theirs pronouns just feels right.

I am very overweight and my body has extremely predominant, even overdeveloped feminine characteristics. I want to start exploring different gender expressions but feel very constrained by my body. And yes, I have tried losing weight but I just don't have a good metabolism and losing a lot of weight would come at the expense of my health. 

I mostly just wanted to get this out there in the world and maybe feel less alone? I would also love tips on how AFAB folks with large breasts and hips have started to explore different gender expressions and the experiences people have had with nontraditional pronouns in English. Thanks!

Someone responded with a remark that his parents love meat more than they love their son.

Someone else responded that it isn't about the love of meat, it is fear of what other people will think about their son being vegan, that the father might feel ""emasculated"" for others to see that his son is a vegan.

And then, someone wrote this below:

Looking for some advice on what to do. My partner is a queer cis man and I'm an AFAB nonbinary person. Some days I feel very happy presenting femme and feel very little dysphoria. Other days I feel incredibly dysphoric and feel best presenting more masc. 


I came out as enby, cut my hair a lot shorter, started using they/them pronouns, etc. around october (we had been dating about 2.5/3 months at that point), and we have talked before about how that has impacted my partner's attraction to me sometimes but how he still loves me and wants to be dating me.

Today when my partner came home and noticed I was packing, he got visibly distant and texted me later saying ""I just can't always be affectionate when you're presenting masc""

Has anyone had any similar experience handling this while in a relationship? I really adore my partner and I understand this isn't necessarily what he's most attracted to, but it also hurts a ton when he says stuff like that and I'm not sure how to approach it.

TW for gender dysphoria, internalized transphobia



I came out as NB and pansexual about 1 year into my marriage. Despite coming to a realization about my identity and orientation, I love my partner (AFAB) and we seem compatible sexually. But in the last year or so, I've had increased issues with decreased sex drive and erectile dysfunction. I still feel strong attraction to my partner, and I get excited during foreplay, but penetration now stresses me out. Each instance of low performance increases my anxiety.

I'm comfortable with oral sex or pleasuring my partner with a toy or my fingers, but they say it's just not the same. They are more satisfied by penetration.

I experience dysphoria with my penis on occasion. It's more of a tool to me than a part of my body. If I transitioned I'm not sure I'd miss it, but it's familiar and I know how it works. Or I thought I did.

I think I have a lot of internalized toxic masculinity from my decades trying to pass as cis male. I'm seeing a therapist, and trying to work through these issues.

My partner is very supportive and never makes me feel impotent or ashamed, but I know it hurts them. We used to have incredible sex, and I love them entirely, so this has been incredibly frustrating for both of us.

I recently had some testosterone injections, which I've been iffy about in the past because I thought they'd stifle my femme side. Turns out I had low hormones across the board. The shots helped me feel more energetic and my sex drive increased, but I'm still having anxiety over the actual penetration, and finding myself getting soft minutes after getting aroused in foreplay.

We've experimented with pegging (them topping me, which I enjoyed but didn't climax) and as I mentioned, I really enjoy performing cunnilingus and fingering, to the point that I get a dopamine release similar to orgasm (I call em drygasms), but I have a hard time climaxing if my partner isn't fully enjoying themselves. I can't use a partner in a selfish way. I'm too aware of how hurtful that is. 

 I honestly sometimes hate depending on my penis so much. It feels transphobic and shitty to not feel like we're having sex if there's no vaginal insertion. If it would just do what I want, then my partner and I could get past this.

Our marriage is great. We've been together 6 years. We communicate, we are emotionally intimate and honest, we enjoy each others company.

So what gives? I'm willing to try pretty much anything at this point. I just got prescribed some ED drug treatment that my doctors believe will help me get my sexual confidence back, so we'll see how that goes, I guess.

I'm worried my condition could be something that won't get better. 

My partner is a schoolteacher and their job has become a source of constant stress for both of us.

I'm transitioning careers and have been going to school (hard at my age, but I inherited a windfall from my Dad so we had the financial security to go single income).

So maybe it's just stress. I have an anxiety disorder, my partner has clinical depression. Needless to say, as a leftist, feminist, NB couple this current presidential administration is a source of much fear and stress, so none of that is helping.

The thing that sucks the most is how this affects my partner's self esteem and their own dysphoria. And I constantly worry that we somehow are going to become less and less compatible even though we deeply care for each other.

Final note: I go soft when masturbating too, but can usually get it back. I think this is because I'm alone and don't get embarrassed or anxious. I almost never watch porn since I came out. (haven't found a lot that caters to my orientation or preferences that isn't horribly transphobic or sexist). Watched a lot in my teens and early 20s, but cut way back once in a committed relationship.

What a mess.

Here’s my problem- I’m disabled. I have quadriparesis (incomplete loss of function in all 4 limbs), so I have little leg, trunk, and hand strength.

2018-05-10 22:19:33,8iit0z,5,9,"Apologies for the essay, TL;DR below.
A few years ago, I started exploring transgender identities, and initially came upon the term ""demigirl."" I later came to find that this term didn't fit me so much, and I opted for, simply, female, but for the time that I had identified as a demigirl, I loved it. There was something about it that made me feel free, as though I were breaking not only biological boundaries, but also binary ones.
Identifying as female, while it is certainly a wonderful feeling, almost feels ever-so-slightly wrong, in some way, despite my 100% female expression and usage of she/her pronouns, feminine name, yada yada yada... I just feel as though there's a tiny bit of me that misses that feeling coming from identifying as NB. Yet, at the same time, I'm fine with identifying as female.
Let's put it this way: I am perfectly okay with identifying as female with all my main friends and my family. I prefer she/her pronouns over anything else, I love my feminine name, and I present 100% feminine. At the same time, I love that odd sense of freedom gained from identifying as NB, and would like to express an NB identity to, at the very least, online LGBTQ+ friends.
I'm worried that this might not really be a yearn to identify as NB, though, and that it might be a sort of ""transtrender"" scenario. That I'm really just yearning for identifying as NB to feel ""cool"" and ""different,"" especially because I talk to NB people and admire them. This worry is accentuated by the fact that I don't outwardly seem to be NB at all, because of my apparent gear toward female identity. I just wanted to know if it would be harmful in any way to identify as NB given the circumstances, if it really could just be a transtrender-like thing. And, if I were to ID as NB, what gender would I even apply as? Given that I'm so inherently female-seeming, is there really any point?
TL;DR I like the feeling of IDing as NB, but I'm worried it might be a ""transtrender"" sort of thing due to how feminine I present + usage of she/her pronouns + not really minding female identity.

2018-05-13 23:22:06,8j7ulz,11,18,"I've been facing a bit of a dilemma. I get a *lot* of ""gender feels"", and have for years. I've kinda grew up around queer spaces and queer discourse from an early age and I've always been interested in gender variance. I've found myself having thoughts like ""it would be really cool to try and look female and see if I could pass"", or ""I wish I could be male and female at the same time"", or ""I feel uncomfortable when I look too masculine, but proud when I look androgynous"". 

However, there's aspects of a queer male identity that I don't want to let go of. I like being able to hang out as ""one of the guys"", and I like being gay for males. I'm also afraid to lose that sort of privilege, since I already have my experiences invalidated oftentimes just existing as an autistic gay guy.

 I don't really mind terms like ""dude"" or ""guy"" at all, and I'm fine with he/him pronouns.

I identify as non-binary and genderfluid. Right now I feel trans masculine. I’m 20 years old AFAB, pronoun indifferent. I feel like I should also mention I’ve been independent from my parents since I was 17, although I’ve always had a decent relationship with my mom.

I’ve been hinting about my identity on Facebook and my super conservative transphobic bigoted grandmother is really the only one who seemed to notice. 
Since today was Mother’s Day I had plans to take my mom to brunch. I’ve been meaning to come out to her but my family is super religious and anti LGBTQ+  so I didn’t plan on doing it today. I also need to tell my mom I’m not religious anymore but I’m more scared of that then telling her I’m NB. I wanted her to have a nice Mother’s Day, due to my grandma that didn’t happen.
My mom called her to say happy mother’s  day and apparently my grandma said a bunch of stuff about me, not sure exactly what but I’m sure it wasn’t nice. 
Well when my mom picked me up one of the very first things she said was, “You look very masculine today” I really really doubt she meant it as a compliment, it felt like an accusation.  I was so anxious when she asked that I hardly remember what I responded. I made a sarcastic comment like oh is God mad at me now?? (Basically what my grandma is saying) she said no but there was so much tension. A bit latter in the car it got brought up again and she was saying how she thought it was too complicated and people can dress however they want without complicating it and that, “It’s simple, there are boys, and there are girls.” I stoped her right there and went off about how that’s not true even just talking about sex not gender, there are intersex people.  I told her that sex is different than gender. I told her I am non-binary and that makes me transgender. I was confident when I told her and made sure to use real science and statistics. She was intimidated by the science and facts I was using because she couldn’t argue against it. She didn’t want to say anything to offend me but was clearly upset and thinks I’m wrong. I tried to get her to say something but it was too confusing for her and she doesn’t know anything about the LGBTQ+ community. She said she didn’t want to offend me. She’s the type of Christian who pretends we don’t exist and that gay or trans is a bad word. She’s not hateful (unlike my grandma) but it’s like she sees it as a disease and wants to stay away to keep herself clean. 
My mom loves me and I know I broke her heart today. The past few years we have been extremely close minus me hiding this from her and I feel like that’s over now. I have no hope for changing her mind on this matter especially since I’m no longer Christian nothing I say really holds weight anymore if that makes sense.  I do want to try and educate her though so she knows what I’m talking about. She doesn’t even know the difference between gender identity and sexual orientation all LGBTQ+ people are the same to her. I would love to find a Christian friendly resource to send her with some info on non-binary and transgender people. Or just any advice in general on how I can explain it to her. I have an anxiety disorder so talking to her in person about this is really difficult for me. 
I didn’t mean for this to be so long and surprisingly I feel like I could keep typing but I’ll stop here. Even if you don’t have advice any encouragement is welcomed. After all of this today I had to work at 10 hour shift in retail so today had been rough to say the least.

2018-05-15 16:53:47,8jn4tx,2,19,"Hey everyone, it's now possible to change your CA birth certificate gender marker by self-affidavit, including to nonbinary.

You don't need to wait until January, as some media have reported. I submitted my paperwork two months ago and just got back my new BC with “nonbinary” listed. I describe my process below. Feel free to ask me anything. 

The process requires a number of forms and other items. I go through the process I used below. The official instructions for this (and changing your name on the BC at the same time if applicable) are here (unfortunately named):  https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHSI/CDPH%20Document%20Library/ADA_Sex%20Change%20(01-18).pdf

Basically, you mail the all of the following items to:
California Department of Public Health
Vital Records - M.S. 5103
P.O. Box 997410
Sacramento, CA 95899-7410

1. Form VS24:  https://www.cdph.ca.gov/CDPH%20Document%20Library/ControlledForms/VS24.pdf
You do not have to complete the last item (#12) per the instruction pdf above.  For a change to nonbinary, write out ""nonbinbary"" in the change field (not ""X"" or ""N"".). 

2. If changing the sex on your BC, include either a affidavit for the change or a certified court order of sex/gender change. For a change to nonbinary, you are most likely going to do an affidavit. They do not provide a form for this affidavit, but I used the template below.

3. If changing the name on your BC, include a certified court order of name change.  This must be an original and will not be returned.

4. Complete the following sworn statement, required to receive a certified copy of your new birth certificate:
https://www.cdph.ca.gov/CDPH%20Document%20Library/ControlledForms/VS111.pdf
You want to select ""certified authorized copy"" in  order to receive copies that will serve as identity documents.

5. Include check or money order payable to CDPH Vital Records: $23 for the change and first certified copy of the birth certificate; include and additional $25 for each additional certified copy that you want. 

6. A photocopy of your current BC, if you have it (NOT required).

But I've never let my mom see my facial hair, or even told her about it. I shave it whenever I go home (about twice a year). She has a lot of issues with my medical transition, and remains totally unprepared to deal with the concept. 

Back when I came out, she was very focused on ""making sure"" that I wasn't going ""all the way"" with my transition, and wouldn't ""become a guy."" It's clear that she thinks being nonbinary means not-transitioning-in-any-overt-way, no matter what I say, and she clings to that.

I declined to make that promise, but honestly, I also downplayed it a lot because she was freaking out. Eventually we hit a point where I had done my due diligence by explaining that yes, I am really actually trans and really actually transitioning and might one day be read as a (feminine) guy, and she decided to ignore that, and I gave her some time to process for the sake of family peace.

I was hoping that as time passed, she would chill out a bit and we could have a more calm conversation. But she hasn't. She's worked on my pronouns, which is good, but that's it.

2018-05-19 16:19:48,8km9ej,0,1,"heyhey! I know you aren't my doctor or psychologist. I also know you can't tell me what gender I have or what my identity is. And writing this I don't know why I'm even writing you. maybe because I just really don't know who I could talk to instead, my family and friends would definitely not understand.

I'm Han/Hannah, afab, therefore offline known as Hannah, online(where no one knows me, like reddit,online games,etc) I'm Han. I'm 19 years old and 4 months ago i started questioning my gender again. 
I went through something similar when I was 15/16 years old. But I didn't know anything about gender, so I never even really started to think properly about it. I started binding (with sports bras because I didn't have anything else), only wore things that are considered masculine, tried to be like my brother (my brother started watching youtube-&gt;shortly after I did as well, he learned skateboard-&gt;I as well wanted to learn that,he started playing computer games-&gt;I did the same; you see the pattern). I ""borrowed"" his clothes which resulted in ""stealing"" them haha
I felt really insecure about myself, felt lonely, a huge black hole inside of me but with school stress and  everything I just didn't even realise those  things. Looking back I feel like that might have been a little depression. 

After that I guess I tried to fit in, wore ""normal"" clothes, still not hyper feminine but not things that made people look at me twice, stopped binding, even went to end of school ball in a dress (i was 18 then)

Now I'm in quite a similar situation in which I was at the age of 15 (19 now). My ""chest dysphoria"" (not even sure it is dysphoria though) has gotten really bad, I even started binding with bandages although I know how bad they are. It was just the only thing that could make me feel a little bit better about myself and make me leave the house these days. also I cut my hair short (finally!!) which I had been wanting to do for the past 4 years but didn't dare to because of negative comments by my mum and hair dresser. 
I really started questioning my gender, got into all the non binary stuff and felt like that was something that might fit. and then obviously I also stumbled upon all the people saying non binary is made up, for special snow flakes, blabla, and all these doubts again made me doubt my identity a lot. I went from labels like agender to trans masc back to just a cis female tomboy. 
one important point I find difficult to talk about is that I experienced a very bad sexual experience. I wouldn't call it abuse yet but I was definitely not happy and really really drunk in that situation. 

I looked up reasons for gender dysphoria and found that sexual abuse is one of them. One thing is, I did bind before that experience, it just got a lot worse afterwards. Isn't it strange that my dysphoria gets worse with my depressive time periods? or are these bad times actually caused by dysphoria?

all that makes me doubt my identity. also I just don't care about pronouns, neutral pronouns don't exist in my mother tongue (or better: they are just really complicated) and they don't make me feel any different. quite recently I got called ""he"" a few rare times, which really made me happy, but ""she"" doesn't make me feel uncomfortable. 

I was high and I saw myself as a granddad for a second. my dysphoria was basically gone in that short moment. it just felt real. 
I got drunk and the opposite happened. every few minutes I had to go to the bathroom, desperately staring at the reflection of my feminine body, trying to hide my chest, in my drunkness pushing it around to make it look smaller (obviously not very effective haha).

Right now my dysphoria is bearable, I just wear baggy clothes and no bra at all and that already helps enough. also I'm comfortable with my name Hannah, although I also like Han which is usually seen as a male name or not connected to any gender at all (although it technically even is a name for everbody)
when I look back at old pictures I don't see myself, sometimesl I'm forced into wearing skirts, which makes me incredibly uncomfortable (usually I can avoid it, thank god) and when I see myself like that it feels like a costume, like a stranger is staring back at me. I feel like that might be my way of dealing with stuff, just seeing it as a costume, not a part of who I am?

In connection to sexuality, I'm bi/pan (depending on your definition of the words). when talking to cis men I often feel uncomfortable because I feel like I'm pushed into the traditional ""woman stereotype"" when talking to a person of any other gender I feel like I can just express who I am without these stupid gender roles that society pushes on us. 

Which makes me question, am I just a cis woman that hates gender roles? Or is there really something wrong with my gender. 

For the last months I've been writing down whether I would consider top surgery or going on testosterone and first I guess I had to get used to the thoughts, for top surgery the answer quite quickly changed to yes definitely, for t I was wondering if I really needed the effects. I guess I would be happier with a slightly deeper voice and maybe a different more masculine facial bone structure, I'm not too sure about facial hair though and feel like I could achieve the voice change with voice training as well. 

Also I'm unsure because of the ""I knew it all my life"" stories and that I was quite happy as a child. I did grow up in quite a gender neutral environment but even in the gendered things I did not feel uncomfortable. I did wear dresses as a child and only when puberty hit and I started growing up I didn't like these things anymore.

It's all just a mess. I can't see a psychotherapist right now because I live abroad for another 3 months and then move back to Germany, I've tried talking to a ton of different people online and it literally has confused me even more most of the time. I just don't know what to do anymore. 
I try to just live without thinking about it, just being myself, but my thoughts always come back to it. Someone just has to consider me a girl/woman and mention it and I'm thinking again. 

I don't even know why I'm writing you all this, maybe you still feel like answering, if not that's perfectly fine.

2018-05-20 03:59:44,8kqddw,13,7,"Hey all! 

Nice to meet you all. Thanks for having a rad subreddit with a rad community. I'm AMAB and ... maybe genderfluid? or transfemme? or enby? Or ... I don't know?

I've been struggling a lot for the past week to come to terms with how / who to refer to myself as and I was hoping some of the more experienced folk around here could help talk me through what the heck is happening.

Over the past several months, I've been doing a lot of good, hard mental work. I've broken through a lot of my longstanding depression and anxiety, and gotten a much stronger grip on my life. I've done this by finding and making peace with my internal critic, who lives in my head and judges me for not being like everyone else.

Unexpectely, this had gender-identity fallout for me last week. On my commute I started seeing trans themes in some of my favorite pieces of art -- and identifying with them -- and then, I asked myself a question that I'd asked many times and always stopped myself before answering: am I a man?

And the answer was: no. You're super not, dude.

Ever since then I can't wear most of my old clothes. My name still sounds fine. Parts of my body feel ... off (body hair, facial hair). I now vividly REMEMBER hating my genitals but I've also had 20 years since puberty to get used to them. 

I feel most comfortable referring to myself with she/her pronouns and talking in my upper register. However, when I slip into networking or dealing / discussion I find my voice dropping and feel masculinity settle into me. Which feels itchy. It passes after 20 minutes or so. 

I've found my fashion sense revert to 90s grunge -- the fashion of my adolescence. The first thing I did the day after I saw it was dye my hair purple and cut thumbholes in a thermal. I've remembered wishing I were Angela when I watched My So Called Life. Fortunately, her layering plaid and grunge gives me 

This does not change the fact that I am a goddam mess.

I've since started to see a therapist. I suspect, if being trans had been something i could consider in my teens without my brain shutting it down with depression/anxiety, I would have been a trans-woman. Now, though, I've spend so long socialized male that I've made peace with some of it.

Which almost makes things harder, because I sometimes feel it trying to erase the female or nb parts.

Me- ""I'm possibly non-binary."" My heart was racing.

Him- ""I thought you decided that long ago.""

Me- ""No....? I was just thinking about it, but I didn't say anything, I was scared to.""

Him- ""I don't see why. Its nothing, it's like being gay.""

Me- ""Well... Its not nothing... But kinda supportive I guess...?""

Silence

Me- ""I haven't decided my pronouns yet, but you wouldnt use them much anyways since I'm not out""

Him- ""I probably wouldn't even if you were.""

Me- ""That's... Rude.""

It continues back and forth for a bit, him claiming that it's fine because it's only bad if you change a person's pronouns, not if you just refuse to use their chosen ones. Also he says he won't remember, so he wouldn't try.

I mean, he's the person I trust most in the world; it feels physically painful. If even he refuses to respect my gender then who would in this conservative farming town I'm stuck in??? I want to close this Pandora's box now plz.

I feel really awful, but maybe he's missing a piece of information here? 

His text when I texted him that what he said hurt:

""Ahh hmm, I’m not very articulate - my point is whatever happens or whatever you are you’re just my friend ____, which is what I was failing to say""

So he's not being snide, he just... Doesn't get it? Idk

Is there a way to make this not complicated? Since I'm not certain which I like should I not be upset? I haven't felt that upset about anyone using she/her until now; now it feels like rejection.

I was active here for a while when I was questioning myself like crazy and eventually came to identify as non-binary.  Here, I felt like I had a community - a rare thing for me.  Last fall, though, I started to acknowledge my deep envy of cis male bodies and realize that I am a trans man.  It took me a while to accept that, and I was somewhat sad about stepping out of this community.  Being here gave me permission to be myself and to talk about things with people who could help and support me because they'd been through the same thing.  In the end, it turned out that myself is a (feminine, dapper, pansexual) man - but I don't think I ever would have discovered that or accepted it had I not first participated in this community and gotten to know myself better.

Thank you for welcoming me and backing me up [that one time I decided to respond to someone who was probably trolling](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/68y3rp/behold_the_truth/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link).  Thank you for being yourselves here, as much as you can.  You will always have an ally/brother in me.

I've started posting on my gender blog again, which has changed from Mx Lexicon to [Mr Lexicon](https://mrlexicon.tumblr.com/).  I plan to finish putting up the non-binary resources I've found on the Resources page there, and my past posts from when I identified as non-binary will stay up.  I hope you'll join me as I journey through this new chapter of gender exploration and eventually start transitioning.  I think I might start spending some time on this sub again just because it's a lovely community with a lot of very stylish people. c:

Also, as a final note, being non-binary is completely valid and wonderful.  Although some people, like me, end up identifying more with binary genders, non-binary people exist, and you all are living proof of that.

Last fall, though, I started to acknowledge my deep envy of cis male bodies and realize that I am a trans man.  It took me a while to accept that, and I was somewhat sad about stepping out of this community.  Being here gave me permission to be myself and to talk about things with people who could help and support me because they'd been through the same thing.  In the end, it turned out that myself is a (feminine, dapper, pansexual) man - but I don't think I ever would have discovered that or accepted it had I not first participated in this community and gotten to know myself better.  \n\nSo, thank you.  Thank you for welcoming me and backing me up [that one time I decided to respond to someone who was probably trolling](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/68y3rp/behold_the_truth/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link).  Thank you for being yourselves here, as much as you can.  You will always have an ally/brother in me.\n\nI've started posting on my gender blog again, which has changed from Mx Lexicon to [Mr Lexicon](https://mrlexicon.tumblr.com/).  I plan to finish putting up the non-binary resources I've found on the Resources page there, and my past posts from when I identified as non-binary will stay up.  I hope you'll join me as I journey through this new chapter of gender exploration and eventually start transitioning.  I think I might start spending some time on this sub again just because it's a lovely community with a lot of very stylish people. c:\n\nAlso, as a final note, being non-binary is completely valid and wonderful.  Although some people, like me, end up identifying more with binary genders, non-binary people exist, and you all are living proof of that.\n\nLove,\n~Mr Lex"", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Thank you, /r/NonBinary', 'created': 1527035607.0}"

When I am on a female swing, I'm all girl, love pretty stuff and wearing skirts, sparkly dangly earrings, etc. I love ""ladies cut"" shirts, girly colors and patterns, etc, and when I'm in full girl mode, even wearing ""unisex"" clothes is dysphoric. My girly side priority is my social presentation, being perceived as all girl. I really don't care what's under the clothes, as long as the outer presentation is all girl.

My guy side is still emerging as a social presentation (partly because a lack of budget keeps me from adding men's clothes to my wardrobe), but has a strong need to fully transition physically, and I've been on testosterone for nearly a year and loving the effects. While I adore the physical effects on my body, especially the muscle growth, and some of the changes are making it difficult to wear my feminine cut shirts. My arms and shoulders are bulking up very nicely and I love my new masc body, but if I go with a larger size ladies shirt to accommodate my musculature, it just hangs ugly on the rest of my body. I prefer closely fit (but not tight) clothing. As a large-breasted person (not for much longer!) I learned early that you buy a shirt to fit the largest size of your body, and alter the rest to fit, but I can't afford to get them all custom tailored, and I don't have the skills or equipment (sewing machine, etc) to do it myself.

I cannot afford to buy new clothes at this time. Not even Goodwill. 

*Note: by some miracle, my face hasn't been masculinized by testosterone, so I still look femme that way.

I have come to identify as non-binary, but as a married father, I face enormous pressure from my wife to present and act as a typical cis-male.

My dysphoria seems to come in waves, and the peaks can be weeks or even months apart, it seems, but last night, my wife gave me criticism for continuing to shave my legs in spite of the fact that I keep getting razor rash and ingrown hairs.  It's hard to blame her because I look like I have some disgusting skin disease on many days, but the honest truth is that I feel the compulsion to shave because I so strongly dislike my masculine body hair.

It's become an ongoing source of conflict between us.  She reminded me that when we got married, she married a man, not an enby.  In a way, it's really unfair to both of us that things turned out this way.  I feel like I'm trying to live more authentically, and she sees me as the man she loved turning into something she doesn't want to be with.  She said that if I had presented as enby from the beginning, she wouldn't have married me.

But frankly, *I* did not know that I was enby until recently.  But as I've said before, there are signs going back years that I diligently covered up and ignored.  Growing up, I was harshly criticised for my persona as it was and I was taught repeatedly by my sexist, narcissistic, misogynist, homophobic, transphobic father that *female is inferior* and he was raising me to be a *real man*.  It should come as a surprise to no one that I censored my own thoughts and feelings that it took well into my fourth decade of life to even allow myself to acknowledge what I feel inside.

I finally said to my wife around bedtime today, ""Non-binary is transgender.""  I can't remember everything I said, but I told her that I feel like I can't tell her the truth because **telling the truth hurts her**, and I can't keep secrets because **keeping secrets hurts her**, so I feel like **I'm doing wrong no matter what I say**.  I think we're going to have some more intensely uncomfortable talks in the coming days because I'm no longer willing to pretend to be something I'm not.

The thing that just drives me insane is that I feel like she is doing something to me whether she is even aware of it or not.  She is so terrified of this change that she is sending small, but very powerful signals to me that my enbiness is completely unacceptable, to the point that I feel like I'm stepping out of line when I insist on expressing myself.

2018-05-23 05:11:42,8lgtgn,2,9,"I made a post a few monrhs back explaining I didn't know how to express my enby-ness. After some supportive comments and suggestions, I set back out into the world with a new point of view. 

I started with Instagram, (a suggestion I was given), and sought out lovely enby people to follow and just find encouragement from. Forgot this was an old account and my (incredibly bigoted) oldest brother followed me and liked one of my pictures that I tagged as enby. Deleted the tag. Deleted Instagram. Again.

Meanwhile on the presentation front, I did some research and bought a compression bra, just as a starter binder in hopes it would help kick start me into this whole gender expression thing. Turns out it was kinda just a waste of money and stretched out quickly to a point where it did as much compression as a regular sports bra minus the comfort. After landing myself a job, I bought a custom binder as a birthday gift to myself, discovering that I'm one of those people that would rather drop a bunch of money on one thing and having it last rather than a little money but have to keep making repeat purchases.  Which isn't an enby fact, but it is still a lesson I learned. I'm kinda at a standstill as far as physical representation, considering there's a lot of things that I can't do because of work dress code policy and the sheer amount of time I no longer have for myself because of my job. 

My days off don't feel like time for me, it feels like recovery. I spend so much time around people with no recharge time, my legs hurt, my back hurts, I feel exhausted. Sometimes I'm caught off guard by the sound of my own name. Sometimes people will call me sir, which I think is just an accident most of the time, but it almost feels... nice(?) when people have to do a double take? Like HA! I almost had you! I know how feminine I look and sound, sometimes I wish I could change it, sometimes I don't care at all. 

I don't actually mind appearing feminine, I just wish I had more control over it. I don't really know how else to explain that. I have my binder now, I want to take it for a test run. Get my hair cut and just feel comfortable again. Not to mention its super hot here now and this long shit that I'm putting up with has got to stop. 

This just feels like venting but I don't have anyone to talk to. I have one trans friend but he lives a couple states away and he works a lot. My boyfriend doesn't really know much about all this but keeps telling me he loves me for who I am (even though my brain tries to tell me he's lying). I don't know.

However, I think lately I’ve been coming to the realization that some (or most?) of my unhappiness in life may be due to the fact that maybe I’m not actually a cis male.

This all being said, I don’t really know how I want to be perceived/treated. But I don’t think it’s this. 

I’m talking about everything in life, but it becomes exceedingly apparent for me in the meeting new people/dating/sexual situations.

For the criminalization of doctors and providers who administer HRT without a vigorous vetting process to determine if one's gender dysphoria is severe enough to warrant medical transitioning, as well as the arrests of patients who take HRT without severe dysphoria, and the immediate arrests of all who engage in DIY transitions.

Our movement right now is split, some of us feel that people should be able to do whatever they want with their bodies, however about 40% of them feel that DIY and informed consent should be criminally prosecuted. About 25% of us support forcible detransitioning to those who undergo the DIY method. On the whole, 75% want to ban informed consent entirely.

We decide we won't go through with our demands publicly on twitter and facebook SO LONG as you meet all our demands:

1) STOP CALLING FOR SELF ID. We believe that the process of changing ID should take a minimum of 2 years after formal diagnosis of Transsexualism under ICD 10.

2) STOP CALLING FOR DEMEDICALIZATION OF BEING TRANSGENDER. Simply put, if you do not have gender dysphoria YOU ARE NOT TRANSGENDER.

3) STOP INSULTING AND ATTACKING TRANSMEDICALISM. Simply put, stop straw manning us.

4) DO NOT BAN THIS ACCOUNT FROM THE SUBREDDIT OR WE WILL GO PUBLIC WITH OUR THREAT TO CALL UPON ACT 5953333325333SD.

Hey! So I posted on here last week asking about STP packers. I know many AFAB NB people but it many have the desire, but I’ve found some do so I thought I’d share my experience with one.

I went with Number One Factories’ Number One STP. As far as STP/packer hybrids goes it’s one of the cheapest. Not SUPER realistic which was actually a draw for me but trans men have said they have used a urinal with them. 

I wanted one to alleviate *some* bottom dysphoria and also while out and about I hate sitting on public toilet seats. I’m very happy to announce that I’ve had zero “peeing down my leg” mishaps and it is nearly invisible when I pack with it (and super comfy!). I just cut a tiny hole on the back flap of men’s briefs/boxer briefs and it stays in place and packs up. I am on the heavier side (5’6”, 38 waist men’s pants). 

It was important to me to find one that didn’t have a bulge as I’m not trying to be read as male. So far I love it. I bought the harness that’s intended to go with it but honestly didn’t need it and found it to complicate things more.

2018-05-29 02:14:16,8mvfog,25,11,"hi! :3 I was wondering if any of you guys could give perspectives on being nonbinary. I'm currently questioning.

So, uhh, I guess this sentiment pops up a lot, but basically I *really don't want to be a ""special snowflake""* or whatever.

I've been thinking a lot about gender recently and I'm not sure what being nonbinary is all about. So, I'm AFAB and have always considered myself cis—like, I don't really think I've just thought much about this. I found out about being nonbinary and thought it sounded very intriguing, but I'm not sure what being NB really means.

Tbh, I think I have ""discomfort"" over my breasts, but I'm not sure if it's dysphoria or something else. I have been avoiding wearing bras for some time because of it, and I wish I could have a flatter chest. I've always wanted a smaller bust size, from when I was young, but I don't know why exactly. I bought a binder but I don't actually wear it since I wear a lot of layers. I am planning on perhaps wearing it during the summer though. Maybe it's just because I think it's cuter and more childish that way, since I don't know if it's a gender thing or just an eating disorder thing (since I have anorexia). I did feel bad about my breasts before my eating disorder flared up though.

Idk, as for pronouns and names and socially considering myself a woman I have no idea what that means, like to consider yourself a woman? I don't relate personally to talks about feminism sometimes but I don't know if that's just because I've not really experienced things that women and girls typically experienced or not. I sort of wish I were described as being more boyish or whatever, instead of feminine or womanly, idk. One time I got a short haircut and was really happy when my mom told me that someone at the salon was confused about my gender. About pronouns I don't know. I don't like being referred to in the third person for some reason—like ""she"" makes me feel awkward, but I don't know if ""they"" would be any better.

The thing is that I'm not sure what it means to be NB rather than,  idk, just want to mess around with gender roles, and I don't want to be appropriating an identity that isn't mine.

But I've been struggling with it more and more lately. When I decided on surgery, I was on testosterone and had been binding daily for a couple of years or so. I was identifying as male and I was OVER wearing a binder.

Anyhow one of my earliest ten memories is finding my birth certificate and with no apparent reason hoping, really strong, that it said nothing in the place of gender. My mother had to assure me five times it actually says something because I couldn't believe it and it was before I could read. I feel so guilty talking about this and fear that I sound stupid. But that's the point because I need to hear once more I'm just insane and have other issues so I can stop thinking about this if I'm wrong.


Up until I started school everything was fine because I was in kindergarten group where everyone knew each other and we were just kids simple as that. Then I was suddenly middle of strangers, I got to feel that vague feeling when you are looked through or as something other than yourself, spoken in manner that for reason you can't define gives out there is some giant mistake at place, and the categorising to two began. I felt insanely insulted every time I was lumped somewhere based on gender no matter where it was. 


It's not because I thought girls (I'm afab) were inferior to boys in any way and I actually was friends with many. I was told everyone feels like this and that no one likes to be categorized. It could be true but I never saw it ruin entire complete afternoon for anyone else so either I'm crazy or there is a reason it always took toll on me. Everyone else seemed calm or happy about something else when I was just angry or sad and felt beaten up, or tried to comfort myself some other way.


Later on I was told reason is I'm misogynist. It's true lot of the times I feel like I'm part of some herd that is effected by mass hysteria that looks silly to me and that I can't understand. But it only effects times I'm expected to hang out with too many girls at once. 1:1 I always understand and respect people. I don't feel I'm more intelligent than those people, I just feel I'm inadequate and can't fill shoes I'm set to.


I feel constantly like something is off. Despite sometimes wishing I could look like guy just to reduce the pressure, I'm disproportionately frightened by anything in my appearance that isn't feminine. I can't wear short hairs, I'd die for feeling of being naked/exposed if I was made to wear a shirt guy could wear. While I enjoy exercise most of things are out of limits because insane fear I gain visible muscles. And also because exercising or doing anything physical at sight of other people explodes something really painful in my brain. Any other situation I'm fine with my body but those moments I feel like ugliest most deformed pile of minced meat on earth.


In addition I have some indirect symptoms of dysphoria. I never do anything for myself and constantly just try to avoid trouble, there is no passion or wanting anything in my life, and I spend most of my time alone or fantasizing about some other life.

My name is Aaryn and I'd like some feedback on my situation~

Im 19 &amp; Ive been on T since 2014. comin up on 4 years here. I'm going to be 2 years post op (top surgery) this year as well. Never going to get bottom surgery because I'm 100% comfy with my nether regions. 
Let's crack into this then, shall we?
So pre T me would beat my face in hearing this, but- I dont like passing fully as a guy. I loved it for the first 2 years, but now I just dont like being classified as a guy. iunno , I just dont, it makes me feel uneasy. I'm obviously 'masculine' looking bc of T, but I still put in an effort to not hide my ' femininity '. I like embracing both. some days I feel more masc, others I feel more femme. I dont even like using those words most of the time because who's to say what's masculine/feminine? anyways, I'm not stealth. If I just met you then you're guaranteed to know I'm trans within an hour of talking to me. I'm very open and proud about it. Personally I prefer to identify as a trans non binary (they/them pronouns). I don't want to be labeled as a man, or a woman.  Honestly I feel like I'm both/neither.  I wish I could pass as androgynous bc I feel like it would help ease this new dysphoria I'm feeling(a second wave of dysphoria?? this is shocking to me). I get dysphoria from both binaries now, this shit is cray to me.

Any advice on this whole rant would be amazing , I dont have a lot of ppl I can talk to about it that understand. 
A few questions I've been thinking..

1. Why do I feel this way? I feel crazy.
2. I've thought about stopping T to see if i could maybe achieve some androgyny, comments ?
3. Any advice on how to look more andro?

2018-05-30 23:17:26,8nd7z4,8,10,"Hi all, I made the mistake of engaging with some strangers on this site, on another board, when they reacted negatively to a press release that mentioned the existence of non-binary people in it.

Several others had already tried explaining what the term meant, and were subsequently sea-lioned and dehumanized.

I have no idea why I thought jumping in would be a good idea, but I did, and I got sucked into it.

I am kinda really... jumpy right now, adrenaline running high, hands kinda shaking. I have done such a good job curating my life both on and offline that it has been literal years since I had such a dehumanizing encounter.

I was wondering if you all may have some suggestions and advice for things I could do right now to help calm down? I want to just forget I made the mistake of engaging with these people, just have a good rest of my evening, but my mind keeps returning to them casually claiming it is impossible to both be human and be non-binary and other such outrageous and disgusting attacks.

Thank you so much in advance.

I have done such a good job curating my life both on and offline that it has been literal years since I had such a dehumanizing encounter.\n\nI was wondering if you all may have some suggestions and advice for things I could do right now to help calm down?

Also, as a nb, i feel like my ""ideal me"" is...very picky/specific? I want a flat chest, okay with my down there parts, i want a lower voice, but im not up for going with hormones (personal choice, for me. Im okay if other people do hrt, im saying im personally not comfortable with it). I feel like a mess and a very picky person with how i want to be. Its like, is it ever possible?

For the voice thing, i just wish there was something i can take so my voice would lower temporarily, but after a while it'll go back to its original voice. (Maybe something like that will be invented in the next 10+ years? Who knows, but i can always hope) I want something like this bc my gender identity likes to fluctuate, so i want to be able to have a higher and a lower voice option, shall i say.

Tbh I've never shared this much about my gender before, so sorry if its long and rant-like. I just wanted to share myself with the community, i guess.
