2018-08-01 01:19:54,93kgcc,8,10,"Hello. I had a vaginoplasty in April 2017 and absolutely hate it. I am a shy, feminine presenting androgyne and it took me forever to figure out I was not ""just"" trans and it is ok to like my penis. My friends were all rather truscum and said lots of shitty things, making it difficult. I've come out because my suffering around this and have been mostly ghosted by them.  


I know I shouldn't have gotten surgery, and don't deny for a second that it helps the people who do want it. So, please don't debate the ethics of regretting surgery. It's happened and that's that. I feel quite certain in my feelings around it, so please don't try to get me to accept things as they are. I don't regret having a vagina, but I deeply regret losing my penis. As such, I want to retain it with whatever route I take.  


I think metoidioplasty would be the ideal pick because I don't like large penises much anyway. I doubt I'd be capable of penetrating with that but aesthetically I like the results better than the phalloplasty results I've seen. Plus I don't want a pump but do want to become erect. A true fantasy option would be a transplant but I don't think that's available yet, especially in a form that is safe from rejection. I can barely find info on what my options are. Most ""detransition"" options are very binary and I don't want to detransition. I just want my girl's penis back.  


I would've went the vaginal agenesis route without question if I had known it existed at the time. It really hurts to know I'll never have the life I truly wanted to have. People finally started really admitting they liked people like me just like I did something I can never take back to be ""normal"" and I cry about it every day.

2018-08-01 21:17:02,93t48r,8,13,"So that's it. I was asked a couple months ago to be in a wedding party and I said yes. It was my brothers fiancee who asked so sure. This was when I was rejecting myself internally and just going with everyone else's flow. Two months ago I finally came to terms with being NB and gay. I've known since forever but just never wanted to say anything. I came out to just myself really, because accepting it was the hardest battle for me. Not out to my family or friends in any kind of way.

I went to a dress fitting a month ago and was overwhelmed. Everyone else in the party is so feminine and was so excited to try on dresses. I was there dressed a little more masculine which I've learned it really all I've ever wanted to dress like. but I wanted to be there to support the bride so I figured I could do a dress for a day. Tried out dresses, they picked one and it was done. I was so uncomfortable. I had to spend $200 on something I don't feel comfortable in and will never wear again. They were talking about not cutting their hair until after the wedding so we could all have matching hairstyles. I have some dysphoria with having longer hair (is that a thing?) so my heart was sinking. I ran after paying. Didn't go out to eat with them because I felt such regret.

Lately I've been regretting it even more. The dresses actually had a problem so we have to go back to pick out a new style. I want to cry everytime I think about it. I don't want to be in a dress. I don't want it to emphasize any of the ""womanly"" curves I have. I want to cancel going to this wedding altogether. I probably can't even afford to go (destination wedding) The dress is non-refundable so I guess I could just let go of that $200.

 My anxiety thinking about a dress is getting worse everyday. In high school I would wear a ton of dresses to kinda make up for the rest of me not being feminine enough. So I guess that's the root of it. I don't know what to do and I don't know if I'm being selfish. I have no one to tell any of this to.

2018-08-03 04:14:46,946ga5,7,5,"So hi. I've never used reddit before but need advice from the internet so I suppose this is the place to go.

I identify as transgender and non-binary. I have feminine and masculine traits and characteristics and like to express myself and my gender in different ways. I'm afab and am not currently on HRT, nor have I had any gender reassignment surgeries. The person I am possibly pursuing a relationship with is a cis male.

The issue: So things between us have progressed and now we have a sexual relationship but nothing official at this point. He is my long-time best friend and we talked about what it would be like if we were to date (why it would/would not work). One of the things he brought up as to why it wouldn't work is that he is ""straight."" This confuses me because I am trans, not female, and yet he seems to like me? I questioned him further on this and he explained that he's physically attracted to me now but if I changed my body, he wouldn't be. This was in reference to the possibility of me starting T. Later it came out that even if I let some of my body hair grow he would be uncomfortable and not want to be with me.

Question: So I'm confused. He likes me now and that's flattering but also keeps saying he's straight, so I don't know whether or not I should be offended?

2018-08-04 03:06:52,94fypq,4,8,"I am AFAB and recently came out as androgyne, leaning masculine. I changed my name on social media and am saving up to have my name legally changed irl. I have begun correcting people who dead name and misgender me, and am getting dead named less and less. Even so, I have always hated my face and body, and in general considered myself one of ""the guys"". Growing up I justified it by stating that I was a weirdo, a freak, and a nerd, and that I simply was not meant to fit in anywhere. 
These days that excuse is simply not cutting it. I began to consider the possibility that I was not a girl when I was 15, and cut my hair short for the first time. I had been wearing male clothing for years by that point in time and was suicidal over my self-image and attraction to other girls. I hated my breasts, especially, as they were awkward and in the way, and I felt morally obligated to wear a bra. I felt completely disconnected from the bottom half of my body, however, and didn't think much of it unless I was PMSing, which is honestly the worst thing ever. I pushed all of these thoughts away throughout puberty because my family is religious, homophobic, and transphobic, and it was hard enough coming to terms with the fact that I wasn't straight let alone trans or nonbinary. 
But even though, I have come out I am still consistently being dead named and misgendered. People insist I am still a girl, despite my identifying as an androgyne. When they do, I find myself silently correcting them and becoming angry that I do not have the courage to tell them that I am not a girl. I find myself becoming furious when guys flirt with me or objectify me, though I am not sure if that is dysphoria or a natural reaction to sexism. It also amuses me to a certain degree because I consider myself more male than anything. I feel the need to behave almost gentlemanly towards the women in my life and to defend them as much as possible, which is difficult because I have social anxiety and trouble advocating for myself. Mostly, though, I am horribly confused. As an androgyne, I consider myself both male and female, but I am beginning to wonder if that is a cop out. I want to pass for male so badly, and have even considered the idea of taking T and today I purchased my first binder. Honestly, I have no idea how I'd go about starting HRT and truly feel no desire, right now anyway, to have any surgeries. Am I supposed to feel this way? Is what I'm describing dysphoria?

Even so, I have always hated my face and body, and in general considered myself one of ""the guys"". Growing up I justified it by stating that I was a weirdo, a freak, and a nerd, and that I simply was not meant to fit in anywhere. \nThese days that excuse is simply not cutting it. I began to consider the possibility that I was not a girl when I was 15, and cut my hair short for the first time. I had been wearing male clothing for years by that point in time and was suicidal over my self-image and attraction to other girls. I hated my breasts, especially, as they were awkward and in the way, and I felt morally obligated to wear a bra. I felt completely disconnected from the bottom half of my body, however, and didn\'t think much of it unless I was PMSing, which is honestly the worst thing ever. I pushed all of these thoughts away throughout puberty because my family is religious, homophobic, and transphobic, and it was hard enough coming to terms with the fact that I wasn\'t straight let alone trans or nonbinary. \nBut even though, I have come out I am still consistently being dead named and misgendered. People insist I am still a girl, despite my identifying as an androgyne. When they do, I find myself silently correcting them and becoming angry that I do not have the courage to tell them that I am not a girl. I find myself becoming furious when guys flirt with me or objectify me, though I am not sure if that is dysphoria or a natural reaction to sexism. It also amuses me to a certain degree because I consider myself more male than anything. I feel the need to behave almost gentlemanly towards the women in my life and to defend them as much as possible, which is difficult because I have social anxiety and trouble advocating for myself. Mostly, though, I am horribly confused. As an androgyne, I consider myself both male and female, but I am beginning to wonder if that is a cop out. I want to pass for male so badly, and have even considered the idea of taking T and today I purchased my first binder. Honestly, I have no idea how I\'d go about starting HRT and truly feel no desire, right now anyway, to have any surgeries. Am I supposed to feel this way?

Now, the odd thing to me is that I really don't feel like myself without my beard. Is it weird for a nonbinary person, born male, to prefer keeping their beard?

I see a therapist every two weeks and while I chose her because she does have a background in transgender issue, I do not see her explicitly for gender therapy, but rather for an anxiety disorder and depression. Obviously, gender comes up sometimes, but I was urged by my mother and my partner to go to therapy following a severe panic attack I had at a family party, again, an incident that had absolutely nothing to do with my dysphoria.

One of the things we have talked about a couple of times are about my thoughts on starting HRT, which I find myself going back and forth on constantly. Most of the time, wearing ""womens clothes"" and makeup is enough to calm my dysphoria, but other times it still doesn't feel like enough. I'm almost positive that I'm still non-binary, but the appeal of looking/being read as slightly more feminine (a non-binary transwoman?) sounds amazing. I don't have genital dysphoria, I don't care if I don't grow breasts, and my voice doesn't both me, but I would love smoother/softer skin, finer/less course body hair, and the fat distribution that I've admired in FtM timelines I've seen. I've told my therapist, ""The idea of never feeling like a man again doesn't sound too bad, but the idea of never feeling like a woman sounds like a nightmare."" Of course, I also have a lot of reservations, namely what if the hormones work TOO well and I look TOO different, scaring off my partner and family.

Anyways, yesterday, something came up during our session that has really got me thinking and flung into a bit of a crisis. We talked about how my anxiety and depression have been extremely high (as in much higher than what I consider my normal level of anxiety) the past 4 or 5 days as has my dysphoria. This led to a discussion about how when I have panic attacks or when something in my life OTHER than dysphoria triggers my anxiety and/or depression, dysphoria often follows shortly afterwards.

What I've been trying to figure out is whether or not there is a correlation between the two or if I just happen to have both anxiety AND dysphoria? More importantly, might my anxiety dissipate if I start HRT? In other words, do have anxiety because my body/mind is secretly craving HRT even when I don't THINK dysphoria is to blame? Because I get anxiety from a lot of other things, not just my assigned gender. Namely, my anxiety stems from pervasive thoughts that I'm a failure, that everything I've ever done and ever will do is wrong, and that I'm a burden to everyone I come in contact with. When my anxiety is very high (as I mentioned it has been lately), I often times slap myself in the face repeatedly, pull my own hair, choke myself, and/or yell at and insult myself in the mirror. I don't really care about my own health, I have very little hope for the future, and I wake up every day thinking about how many hours before its socially acceptable for me to go back to bed, but again, these thoughts don't hinge on my dysphoria. Still, could these thoughts be an extension of dysphoria without me knowing it?

2018-08-07 09:02:40,959zwl,3,7,"Hey folks,

been lying around yesterday and thinking about things again and would like to know what you folks think.

What are your desires and what would be the best way (realistic or not) to fulfill them?

Do you feel like you are mostly desiring what you don't have, sometimes even in extreme ways?

As I'm aware that I tend to post questions in a survey like style, I just start by answering the questions from my perspective:

I feel like my normal, every day desires are mostly paused. I don't really know how to proceed with life (in a sense of moving forward) until I resolved how my gender works. Regarding gender, I'd wish to have shape-shifting powers (I know, unrealistic), even just minor, like changing the distribution of fat. As this isn't really working that way, I want to be somewhat ambiguous, so that at least an accentuation of some features is possible.

For the second question, I definitely tend to desire what I don't have and I wonder if it would just vanish when I achieved it or if it would just be substituted by a bigger goal. 

For example, on the days I'm more feminine leaning, I definitely want a more feminine body, even though I know I'm not IDing as female. It feels weird, because I desire to look like a tomboy, but would that change to femme if I achieved the tomboyish look? I'm not even sure I want a body like that as it seems to be an exaggeration of wanting to be more feminine/being accepted while being more feminine?

I'm sure someones made a post similar to this before but... I've been struggling a lot lately with cashiers (and other people in public who I only see for a brief moment of time) as far as whether or not I should correct them about my pronouns. 

I use they/them pronouns exclusively with people who know me, it's been a fairly new transition  (the last 6 months) but now that people I'm close with rarely misgender me, its becoming a lot more obvious and sort of creates some  dysphoria when people say things like ""thanks lady (miss, girl, insert other femme terms)"". I've started wearing pins that say they/them on it. But I don't always remember to put them on and also it bothers me that I have to put a badge on myself just to get people to know. I think it's hard because I definitely present super femme, but I dress how I feel comfortable and I don't think I should have to try and look more masc just to get people to respect my pronouns.

Drakin (Dragonborn) in my setting can change sex based on the need of the community (if there are not enough egg layers then the hormones of some will change) and Avians (Aarakroca), males have more show feathers and are more brightly colored. Elves have thousands of recognized genders but there is very little difference based on hormones (all fall into a more androgynous appearance based on human standards) .

In this draft of the guide I am using two entries for each race ""Sexual Dimorphism""  to go over typical difference based on hormones and reproduction and discuss and ""Gender Variation"" to go over more of the social roles and views of gender and personal identification and expression. This is the best I have been able to come up with but I am afraid it may not be the best way to sort this of stuff out. These sections will mostly be blurbs, no more than 2 sentences, but I want them to be meaningful.

In terms of outward appearance I would like to present as more gender neutral or maybe more fem than I currently present. At least sometimes. Kind of gender fluid? Sometimes I wake up feeling like I want to present slightly male but other times the dial setting is neutral or slightly female. 

But I don’t feel trans and don’t want to change my assigned birth gender.

I've intellectually accepted that I'm somewhere outside my assigned-gender-at-birth, and the enby label feels right for me right now... BUT I'm really unsure about how I feel and what the dimensions of my gender actually are. 

Sometimes I feel like a girl, especially when I see women's bodies (like at the gym) I want to be more like them. I want to wear a sportsbra and leggings (I do wear leggings, and nail polish, but I'm read as male every day and I've lived as a man my whole life).  On the other hand, I don't really want boobs and I'm fine with the downstairs equipment I have.... and I don't *really* think I experience dysphoria?? (Except lately I'm really hating my facial hair and I need a new haircut and my face is just... my face i don't have any feelings about it i guess. But in the past I've loved having rough stubble ). 

I'm stuck feeling as though I might have a girlish side to explore, but I'm both: a) terrified of opening that door and being ""really trans"" (which I recognize is a medicalist/problematic opinion, and I'm trying to stop thinking it, but it still makes me afraid), and b) afraid that by exploring and claiming labels like ""trans woman"", ""transfeminine"", or even ""gay/lesbian"" (since if I'm a woman that makes me gay??) I'm doing a really bad thing by *appropriating* the experiences of women and gay/lesbian people and nobody in the queer community will accept me because I haven't lived that struggle and I'm not actively trying to look more high-femme or medically transition (yet?). 

**Just generally feeling stuck... TL;DR:** 

\- Not sure how to deal with huge washing amounts of fear I get when thinking about if I'm a nonbinary woman or maybe a trans woman (which i basically lock down automatically in my brain, I can't even open that up to rly feel it out, i can only handle it at an intellectual level right now) 

\- not sure how to deal with the guilt of feeling like I'm stepping on other people's identities and stealing their hard-earned labels. This is a really big one right now

\- not sure if what I feel is a part of my nonbinaryness (maybe I'm a demigirl who's happy to be in a masc-ish body) or if I'm actually a trans woman in severe repressed denial

I'm a social worker who works with lots of different clients a lot of whom have high levels of cognitive decline. Today a client commented on my nail polish and said ""are you some kind of poofter??"" and then said ""you have dyed hair but I don't know what you have in your pants"". And I just had to say ""Um excuse me."" and quickly move on. 

Then I had to be alone for a while and found that it gave me a lot of intense feelings and I just wanted to share them. Clients say all sorts of things when you work with them sometimes personal things, but this got me for some reason, in a way that I could not laugh off. 

When I was younger I used to like appearing quite androgynous, I had long hair and didn't have much body hair. I was often mistaken for a girl which I didn't like and very occasionally people in pick up trucks would yell the F word at me when I was walking home from school which obviously made me very uncomfortable. I feel like I retreated, instead of trying to figure out who I was I retreated into what I saw as the social safety of masculinity.  

It was more the social dysphoria that really made me stressed and depressed. I lived in a university college and the toxic masculinity that surrounded me and the things that male residents would say to me because they saw me as a dude (along the lines of 'hey man we gotta get you laid', um no thank you/I don't have time to get into everything wrong with what you just said to me). 

It was only after university that I really 'discovered' the enby world, and it just explained a lot for me. I had been going around calling myself bi, which I thought was what my deal was, and it allowed me to express a certain aspect of my queerness which was fine but it also felt a little bit dishonest to myself. 

I had to unpack a lot of my own queerphobia when it came to being genderqueer, 'am I just doing this to avoid addressing my complicity in hegemonic masculinity?' 'is this just a fashion?' all of that, before arriving at the conclusion that I think a lot of people come to which is namely that cishet people don't lose sleep over presenting as cishet, and that it's ok to be fucking confused all day.

Fast forward to now, and being my colourful queer self trying to help people, and those feelings that made me retreat into my masculinity when I was younger really came flooding back today.

Anyone else have a complicated history of feeling their dysphoria inducing body parts were cancerous and have a history of trouble separating those fears and delusions from their underlying gender dysphoria?

At age 12 or 13 when I first started experiencing gender dysphoria, I was also convinced most of the time I was terminally ill with strong suicidal ideations that I avoided only through heavy disassociation and obsessive compulsive hyper religiosity. It was specifically penile and testicular cancer that I was obsessed with, only when I had a mental health breakdown at age 20 did I get hospitalized and convinced I was cancer free. 

It is real embarrassing to admit this but I interpreted the discoloration on the underside of my penis raphe and testicles as cancerous which was rapidly metastasizing from there throughout my body. But where my dysphoria comes in is that I held out a slim chance that the cancer had not spread I could get the cancerous tissue removed and have a vaginoplasty with what skin remained/skin grafts from elsewhere. 

Looking back on it this was a weird type of forced feminization fantasy, an exception that I rationalized God and my Roman Catholic birth faith would allow me to transition from male to female without excommunication. Although from ages 20 to 30 I wasn’t hypochondriac, I was still depressed and often suicidal due to my still repressed gender dysphoria while I immersed myself in Sedevacantist Traditionalist Catholicism. Only when I gave up my Catholic faith in 2016 did I start to in a way give up that repression a little and create a reddit account after being a only a lurker for about 10 years on a variety of websites/forums. I created a twitter account in March 2017, made trans friends there and finally in Oct. 2017 found out that being non-binary fit my kind of gender dysphoria. 

I’m taking my transition to a non-binary trans fem slow, attending a monthly trans and non-binary support group, using they/them pronouns there and on reddit/twitter as I’m still closeted with everyone else.

I guess this is a post seeking reasaurance and validation.

Some background: I am AFAB and have been identifying as nonbinary for somewhere around five months now. I just started a new job and came out to my coworkers. They all took it well, it seems. I'm fortunate.

We are currently at a kickoff event for our organization learning more about what we do and our mission. I found other nonbinary and trans folk at the event and have made connections.

What makes me feel awkward is I cannot be easily identified as enby based on looks alone and am instantly seen as a woman. Whereas many associate being nonbinary with anrogyny, I am comfortable presenting feminine. Although dressing femininely, I lack a strong self-identification as a woman. 

Still, I use the woman's restroom because I recognize how I appear to others and feel no discomfort using those restrooms. I also feel like I should reserve the gender neutral bathroom on-site for those who may need it more than I do.

I guess my big issue is feeling like I'm being judged for identifying as enby but still using women's restrooms and dressing feminine. I'm afraid of not being taken seriously. Can anyone help alleviate my anxiety over this?

What do you do in certain situations, like when you are in an uncomfortable social situation, or when you are feeling internally bad?

I guess it's only reasonable to start ;)

For me it depends. If I'm feeling off or full on dysphoric about my body, I try to ignore it for a while (not putting too much attention on it). If it doesn't go away, I try to actively distract myself by reading, gaming or other stuff. If nothing else works, I try to move my body, exercise or practice complicated movements.

In social situations, I mostly suffer through it. There are some people I tell when they misstep, but as I'm not out to many people, I don't have the courage to stand up to them without being out.

So what do you do? What are your experiences?

2018-08-20 01:36:45,98phws,2,6,"Gender is something I've ""struggled"" with my entire life. I've had moments of low self esteem (ie. highschool) but overall I am fairly confident in myself and unashamed of letting people know who I am. Most of my close friends and family (siblings) know I am non-binary or genderfluid or at the least something along those lines. That brings me to my problem...which I've suddenly realized....is a pretty huge problem. I have been dating the same person for over three years and they DO NOT KNOW that I am not a woman. Sometimes, I am unbothered by this. But other times, like as I type this message knowing it will be read by people who understand...it hurts badly.

I wrote previously about the struggles my wife and I have gone thru as we've tried to understand what I am.  It's been really tough for both of us, but in a way, it feels like just the beginning of my difficulties.  Even though she tried to understand me, she fears (and I believe reasonably so) that bad things could happen to us when other people find out about me.

I am AMAB and sort of envy the binary trans folks, as hard as their lot is.  They are considered disgusting freaks by large parts of the population, and as unfortunate as that is, they at least have the option to live in deep stealth; to have hope that they can eventually pass as what they feel like inside and be accepted.

As for me, I am an AMAB enby near the beginning of my journey of self-discovery, as you might call it.  What am I going to look like?  How will I present myself?  (I think I'm going to go for an androgyne look eventually.)

What are people going to think when they see me on the street?  I imagine that for many people, the answer is going to be that they'll think I'm a freak.  I had a dream a few nights ago that I was out and about in public wearing a dress, and several young men were aggressively stalking me and I was afraid that they were going to hurt me.

Is that my fate?  To choose between pretending to be cis because that's what everyone expects of me?  To hide who I am because society would consider me a freak?  To hide who I am because my children might get bullied at school because I am a freak?  To have beer bottles tossed at my head from moving vehicles because I am a freak?  To have the wait staff at restaurants spit in my food because I am a freak?  To end up dead on the street somewhere because my mere existence is intolerable to some people?

It just hit me recently that I am going to have to inform my FOO that I am trans.  They're not going to like it.  I would prefer that they never knew, but they are going to find out eventually.  The only thing I have control over is when and how they find out.

I don't know what to think anymore.

I wanted to take a moment to just give a big shout-out and offer my heartfelt thanks to those of you who have the courage to post selfies here on the public internet.

I am still in the closet except to my wife and a few close friends.

Some day, I'll probably do a face reveal of my own on this subreddit, but here's part of the reason that these selfies mean so much to me, and I'm sure that my feeling is shared by many.

**The selfies posted on this sub have been helping me find myself.**

You see, each one of these selfies exudes the non-binariness of the unique poster.  No two are alike. 
 I look at one selfie and recognise something about myself in it, and then I look at another selfie and it looks completely foreign to me, like the presentation would be entirely incongruent with my gender identity and expression. (but it may be absolutely perfect for the poster!)

Browsing these selfies is almost like looking at clothes and thinking about which ones I would be comfortable wearing.

As difficult as it is to imagine a presentation that would really feel comfortable for me, seeing the presentations of others helps a lot!

In an ideal world if post this on ELI5, but given the topic I feel like things might get toxic quickly if I do. 

I’m male cisgendered and heterosexual, so I’ll start with the following statement:
I can not, and do not, pretend to know what it’s like to identify as non-binary or have any other sexual preference to mine and live with the accompanying prejudice and associated emotions. In light of this, if I get terminology wrong, please don’t hurt me - I’m not trying to trigger or offend, I really would like to be educated - after all, I am playing life on ‘easy mode’. Granted my brain has never worked properly (to quite dramatic effect) and I’m a chronic pain patient after a spinal injury, but still; the world is biased towards people like me in a pretty stupid way. 

Context:
I often find that official forms have only binary options for gender, occasionally there is the option for rather not say (this seems to be unique to academic, demographic, and market - from time to time i see an ‘other’ box. 

I saw an article where someone couldn’t open a bank account because they couldn’t select a  gender other than M/F. In this situation how would react, would you rather go without a bank acct, renting a house or anything else on principal, or would you compromise?

I understand people are individuals, and I’m not assuming that there’s a spokesperson for the non-binary community!! Just would be cool to hear a few viewpoints.

2018-08-22 04:36:00,99acw0,7,7,"I believe that I need professional help making things work with my wife of eight years.

I came out on this group five months ago after some soul-searching.  I knew that I didn't feel right about living the rest of my life as a cisgender male, but that's what is expected of me by literally everyone I know.  I talked to my wife about this and she reluctantly allowed me to experiment with clothes inside the house around her, but she made it very clear to me that ""she married a man"", and that's what she expects me to be because she is ""very straight"".  On top of this, my parents raised me to believe that transgender people are disgusting, as I mentioned in many previous posts.

What is happening is not fair to me and it is not fair to her, but it is what it is.

It feels unfair to me that I am in a situation where it is expected that I live my life pretending to be something I'm not to make everyone else comfortable and happy, and it feels unfair to my wife that the man she thought she married is becoming something different.

I feel like we're both nibbling on opposite ends of an excrement sandwich.  And we have a small daughter between us who will have to live with the consequences of the decisions we make.

***

I asked my doctor today for a referral to a therapist who is an expert at this sort of thing.  I told her that I have gender dysphoria.  She observed that I am always anxious when I visit her office, and then she told me something that spiked my anxiety: she said that she thinks that I don't have gender dysphoria and she would refer me to someone who helped her patients avoid getting divorced.

I didn't ask for help avoiding divorce.  If divorce is the least bad solution to our problem, then so be it.  I don't want divorce and it would break my heart, but **it would hurt even more to live the rest of my life pretending that everything is fine when I feel like I'm screaming inside and no one can hear me because no one wants to hear me because everyone else wants to think that everything is fine and just carry on.**

The best outcome is that we learn to live together happily the way we are, but I can't demand that outcome because I'm not in control of everything.

***

Needless to say, I am not enthused about the referral my doctor is processing for me.  I just sent a message asking my therapist for a referral to someone who is an expert at this sort of thing, but I wanted to bring my question to this community:

Why is everything gendered?It’s always “niece” and “daughter” and I always refer to myself as their child, a neutral title for a younger person.

2018-08-24 04:36:52,99uh72,20,13,"I've been reading a bit about what HRT is like for binary trans folks.  One really good description is in the essay ""Boygasms and Girlgasms"", by Julia Serano, linked here: [http://angg.twu.net/LATEX/whipping-girl.pdf](http://angg.twu.net/LATEX/whipping-girl.pdf).  It is mostly SFW and covers far more about the effects of MtF HRT than just sexuality.

I think that it's interesting that both MtF and FtM folks typically describe greater satisfaction with their sexuality after starting HRT.

Most discussion of HRT here seems to center around reshaping the body, but Serano conveys a very palpable satisfaction with how her senses have changes and how she experiences life internally.  I must admit that I feel a tinge of jealousy. ;-)  Acknowledging how I felt made me wonder if I'm actually MtF also.

I wasn't really that interested in HRT until I started reading accounts of how people change how they feel inside, not just the face in the mirror.

So... I'm wondering what experience I could expect if I start HRT as an AMAB enby.  Of course, I don't mind to hear about AFAB enby experiences, as well.

The first question that comes to mind is what HRT regimen I might possibly benefit from.  I frequently hear of MtF folks taking steps to reduce their T levels to near 0.  My understanding is that healthy cis women naturally have a significant amount of T in their bodies, just far less than men.  As someone who enjoys the outdoors, I would be very wary of dropping my T levels to 0.  And besides, I identify as enby; I think I would enjoy a more androgynous body; I'm not looking for curves to attract guys and I would like to keep the great part of my musculature.

The second question is supposing that I adopted an HRT regimen that would keep my hormone levels somewhere between healthy male and female levels and it helped me develop a more androgynous body (a big if), how would my ""inner experience"" compare to the inner experiences of binary trans folks?

&amp;#x200B;

New here and really happy to have stumbled across this sub. 

&amp;#x200B;

I came out as NB about 6 months ago i.e. made a formal request to friends and family to use a different name and they/them pronouns; I've gotten push-back from some people because I'm very masculine presenting without much effort. It's been somewhat disheartening as I feel like I've finally made big steps toward accepting who I truly am, only to feel further ostracized by individuals within the queer community. I grew up in a somewhat conservative environment where I was often physically disciplined if I did act ""manly"" enough -- which I think greatly impacts my subconscious presentation. I think another part of this is growing pains associated with reclaiming my queer identity after being shoved into the ""daddy/dom"" box within the gay community.  


Any words of support, sharing of experiences, or ideas about best practices for responding to dismissive/negative language would be greatly appreciated. &lt;333

I’ve been slowly coming to terms with my identity over the course of four years. It’s been hard, because identifying as a different gender has always been this big thing in my head compared to sexuality, so when it hit me at first that I might be agender/nonbinary I immediately shoved it away (it doesn’t help I was raised extremely conservatively). Since then, though, it never left my head. It was always in the back somewhere. It makes sense, because it is how I feel (I’m 80% sure at this point, the closest I’ve allowed myself to be this far lol).
Even before I had breasts, I remember thinking that I should enjoy lying on my chest now because I won’t be able to the same again once I grow them. I’ve always hated them, I feel fucking gross half the time when I see them (especially in swimsuits). I finally was allowed to cut my hair short and boyish, and immediately I recognized myself and felt so good. I hated having long hair so much (I recognize that this is self expression and not gender necessarily, since anyone can have long hair, but it felt like I was a ‘short hair person walking around with long hair’). I don’t often hate my bottom parts, but occasionally I’ll feel gross about them as well (but I know for certain I do *not* want a dick, I don’t want t, and I don’t feel like a man at all).
The anxiousness came back full force tonight because I saw a video of a nonbinary youtuber showing their transition through top surgery. It was a great video, and as it went on it scared me because I already knew I hate my breasts, and I *have* thought about getting them off, I’ve just tried to avoid thinking about it because that’s such a big thing to me. Seeing that video made me realize that I do want that, and it scared the shit out of me being faced full-force with that realization. I have a huge fear of both needles and surgery which doesn’t help, but that isn’t even the main fear. It’s just.. such a huge sudden change (which I don’t deal well with). And it’s permanent. I’ve had nightmares about getting *tattoos* because that idea of unalterable permanence and commitment just scares me.
At the same time though I felt relief..? I think from knowing something about how I feel for certain. It’s nice having that mental and emotional confirmation, but of course it’s mixed with the fear that something that I really really want is so *big*.

2018-08-27 23:08:18,9atqm4,1,9,"AFAB, first post on this subreddit!

&amp;#x200B;

I've been playing around with the idea of gender for the past 5 years, but just recently found my label: agenderflux. After a few weeks of mulling over the pros and cons of transitioning, I think I'm going to try for a FTN transition! This post is mostly just me trying to get a sounding board for where I want to go with this. I know this is an incredibly personal issue and no two transitions are the same, but I would love some input from people who deal with this issue. 

Alright, here's the master plan thus far:

1. Grow my body hair out. Just what it says on the tin, let everything go and see where it takes me. This decision is easily reversible if I end up not liking certain patches/just can't live with armpit hair. Also, my workplace is not very open for something like this (body hair on AFAB would be seen as unprofessional) so I'm going to invest in a handful of business appropriate leggings/stockings so I never have to go bare-legged to work. 
2. I've made an appointment with my favourite hairdresser in my hometown to get a gender neutral haircut that goes with my facial structure. I'll have to wait until I go home for Thanksgiving, but the wait will give me time to think if I really want to cut 2 feet off my hair. I will leave it long enough to style for a professional office space.
3. Get a binder for masculine days. My boobs are obnoxiously big (E cup) so not sure how this is going to go.
4. Invest in a more androgynous wardrobe. First off, pants are the literal devil, so only skirts for me. But I was thinking I could mix and match masculine and feminine styles and maybe buy some oversized sweaters to pair with those leggings I am buying. Either way, I want to lose about 30 pounds before I start looking to supplement my wardrobe (this number is mostly so I can feel more healthy, but also to get me down to a size range where I know I can find clothes that will fit). I've already started losing weight and am hopeful that I can be down those 30 pounds by the new year and get some new/used clothes as a Christmas present to myself. 
5. Actually learn how to use my makeup kit. I want to be able to make my face more masculine and makeup is the easiest way for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

My biggest concerns: 

I'm honestly really nervous about this whole plan. Even though I have been thinking about my gender for 5 years, and toying with the idea of transitioning for nearly 3 months, it's terrifying to actually have a plan in place. I'm mostly scared that a) I won't like the changes to my body/presentation, b) I will face a lot of ridicule for choosing to transition, and c) I will get part way through it and realize that I was kidding myself the whole time and the gender I was assigned is actually correct (this one I know isn't going to happen, but I can't seem to convince my emotions that this isn't a phase). 

The other concern I have is with my husband. He has been unbelievably accepting the entire way (his exact words were: ""It's your body, do what you want. If you want to be a dragon, I will buy you frickin scales. Now hand me the ice cream.""). However, we have talked about this fairly seriously and his one big thing is that he has always seen himself as very heterosexual and very cisgender, never a question in his mind. He says that he will support me no matter what I decide, but it will just take him a little while to wrap his mind around not being in a straight relationship. So I am a bit concerned about straining our marriage. We've done well so far and I really love him, so I don't want to cause him stress. I'm also scared that my transitioning might harm some of his relationships with his conservative family. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, thanks for reading my novel. If you guys have any advice/suggestions/encouragement, I would love to hear it!

2018-08-28 12:17:42,9ayepo,10,9,"One of the major mindfucks I'm currently experiencing is how to properly teach non-binary language expression in my French and Spanish classes. For those that aren't the best with other European languages, gender goes a lot deeper than just pronouns (which is most of the language issue in English along with other words that we can mostly get around-sibling instead of brother/sister, spouse instead of husband/wife etc.) and has an effect on nearly any sentence describing someone. For example, if I were to say ""[he is/she is/they are] a good student"" in either language 4 of those words require a gender marker. Literally everything but the verb (verbs are awesome and don't give a fuck about gender). 

So I'm looking for **native speakers** to point me in the right direction for resources or advice on how to approach these to teach them more inclusively (and to better express myself as well).

For those that aren\'t the best with other European languages, gender goes a lot deeper than just pronouns (which is most of the language issue in English along with other words that we can mostly get around-sibling instead of brother/sister, spouse instead of husband/wife etc.) and has an effect on nearly any sentence describing someone. For example, if I were to say ""[he is/she is/they are] a good student"" in either language 4 of those words require a gender marker. Literally everything but the verb (verbs are awesome and don\'t give a fuck about gender). \n\nSo I\'m looking for **native speakers** to point me in the right direction for resources or advice on how to approach these to teach them more inclusively (and to better express myself as well).

2018-08-30 14:14:47,9bjzdi,25,31," 

Hey, all. I'm late 30s AFAB and I’ve always been androgynous/more masculine-presenting. I've been out as queer for 20 years, but only recently accepted that I'm NB. It’s been a lifelong journey to get here. Though I'm sure younger folks have plenty to teach me, I’m particularly interested in hearing from any older  (\~35+) NB folks who have discovered/accepted their identity later in life.

&amp;#x200B;

One thing I’m struggling with is whether or not to bother coming out. For me, this involves asking people to use a shortened version of my birth name (90% of people in my life already use the name I like), probably using they/them pronouns (still deciding how I feel about that, I think I like it), and not being called girl, sister, etc. My spouse and some close friends know, and they're great. It's been weird, but OK. I have spent my entire life building a happy queer/liberal bubble around myself, so disclosing my identity doesn’t feel unsafe. I worry a bit about future employment, and I am terrified of telling my elderly parents, but otherwise I feel very little risk. I guess coming out this time around feels less exciting and more like...a hassle?

&amp;#x200B;

On the one hand, disclosing my identity is really cathartic because I have been carrying this baggage around for so long, and it’s nice to know other people might begin to see me the way I see myself. This is a huge internal mental/emotional shift for me, but unless I tell other people about it, they will continue assuming that I identify as a masculine woman and a lesbian. On the other hand, it feels sort of anticlimactic and not worth the trouble, unwanted attention, and potential discomfort/confusion from others.

I'm late 30s AFAB and I’ve always been androgynous/more masculine-presenting. I've been out as queer for 20 years, but only recently accepted that I'm NB. It’s been a lifelong journey to get here. Though I'm sure younger folks have plenty to teach me, I’m particularly interested in hearing from any older  (\\~35+) NB folks who have discovered/accepted their identity later in life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I’m struggling with is whether or not to bother coming out. For me, this involves asking people to use a shortened version of my birth name (90% of people in my life already use the name I like), probably using they/them pronouns (still deciding how I feel about that, I think I like it), and not being called girl, sister, etc. My spouse and some close friends know, and they're great. It's been weird, but OK. I have spent my entire life building a happy queer/liberal bubble around myself, so disclosing my identity doesn’t feel unsafe. I worry a bit about future employment, and I am terrified of telling my elderly parents, but otherwise I feel very little risk. I guess coming out this time around feels less exciting and more like...a hassle?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the one hand, disclosing my identity is really cathartic because I have been carrying this baggage around for so long, and it’s nice to know other people might begin to see me the way I see myself. This is a huge internal mental/emotional shift for me, but unless I tell other people about it, they will continue assuming that I identify as a masculine woman and a lesbian. On the other hand, it feels sort of anticlimactic and not worth the trouble, unwanted attention, and potential discomfort/confusion from others.

2018-08-31 05:06:43,9bqsqr,3,10,"Hey folks!

I finally got set up with an appointment to see a transgender therapist in a few days.  I've been turning over my memories of thoughts and experiences that led me to believe that I am transgender.

So... I am AMAB, as some of you know.

I always struggled to fit in like a outsider perpetually trapped outside of society.  I seemed as if I was always being castigated by adults for not behaving as I should, and I was shunned by other children for reasons I never could understand.

The earliest experience of gender dysphoria I can recall was that as a child, I longed to wear feminine swimwear.  I can't say why.  It just looked ""comfortable"" for lack of a better word.

Given how I felt constantly judged as inferior and defective, it's no wonder that I never told \*anyone\* of these feelings, but something just occurred to me.

I imagine a scenario where I, as my young child self, am sitting on a beach under the watchful eye of my family.  Suddenly, time freezes, and I am approached by a friendly character, something like an angel or a fairy.  The character looks into my frightened eyes and says, ""I know what you dream of doing on this beach, and you need not be afraid of it anymore, because I have been sent here to grant your most secret desires.  I'm going to take you away to a place where you can experience all of them, and no one here will ever need to know about it.  It will be our special secret because you know what?  I was sent here to love you and care for you the way you are.  All these other people tell you you're not good enough, but I think you're amazing, okay?  You were made this way for a reason, and when you grow up you're going to treat other people kindly, just as I do for you, okay?  You don't need to be afraid anymore.""

And then, she takes me away somewhere, and I become a girl for the duration of this fantasy, and she takes me shopping for swimwear, and I curiously try on everything I can get my hands on, and no one judges that I am foolish, weird, gay, or what have you, and I have a great time, and then she finally takes me back to the beach attired as I desire, and I play in the surf until I am utterly exhausted while my newfound guardian protects me from those jellyfish that I hate so much.
