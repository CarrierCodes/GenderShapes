Which is kind of sweet, but there are some concerns.

First off, I'm OUT I dont edit my identity for my partner's family and they're confused but fine with it.  They misgender me and deadname me on accident but mostly it just annoys me, they're ignorant but not transphobic.  However my partners grandfather is an avid trump supporter, but mostly because hes one of those folks who thinks trump is a good businessman and will help this country. He's wrong but hes also old as hell so I'm not going to bother trying to change his mind.  He isnt racist (but he also isnt a poc ally) and hes not homophobic or transphobic  (but hes also not really doing anything to educate himself either).  I also just get weirded out by him because my cultural upbringing interprets most of his body language as very direct and intimidating, but I also know friendly shoulder and arm touching and direct eye contact are common American things.  I guess there are a lot of things he does that make me a *little* uncomfortable but not enough for me to peg him as someone I dislike.

So, now that hes started saying these things I feel anxious about family gatherings because I dont know when he gonna ask me for ""the talk"" and I also dont want to take the initiative on this.  Hes very tech savvy for a 70 year old man, he made his own PC so I am 80% sure he could just google trans issues.  Which makes me think he wants to know why *I specifically* am trans and that's a lot of pressure.  But I also know if I just calm down and talk to him we might be closer which is nice because I love my partners family.  I just hate being vulnerable.

What I want to ask is: do any of yall have advice or anecdotes about talking to elder family members about this stuff? I do want to help him get educated I just loose confidence when talking about my own personal experiences with the family because I haven't had a good life and I dont want them knowing that.

2018-12-04 12:49:06,a30dx0,11,1,"I've been going to a physiotherapist because I have very stiff muscles in my shoulders and back (keep that in mind, because that might carry weight in this situation).

I started wearing a binder two months ago, and got increasingly more pain under my armpits and beneath my shoulder blades when I did. Sometimes my ribs would ache as well. Since I've started practicing my posture accorting to how my physiotherapist recommended, all of that is gone!

I gathered my courage and told my physiotherapist about my issues, and where they stem from (luckily, she was totally great about everything!)

She explained what was happening as follows:

when there is pressure on the front side of the chest (which is true for binders), the back muscles pull your shoulder blades down (aka, your lower back is more arched, and your shoulders also pull back as a result). Which involves all of the muscles that were painful for me: the ones beneath my shoulderblades, the ones below my armpits, and even the muscles across my ribs (flanks) that ached.

What she told me to do was this: when wearing your binder, feel the pressure on the front side. Your first instinct will be to push back against that, and start breathing high in your chest. Don't do that, because it'll make everything even more painful.

Instead, try to feel the band beneath your shoulderblades on your back (I guess where the bra strap would've been). And while breathing, focus on that area. Feel it, and feel that part of your chest expand. So instead of breathing high in your chest and fighting against the pressure, seek the room in the back. I personally wear gc2b binders, and those are stretchy in the back, so I have lots of room to breathe there! It made perfect sense once I started breathing like that.

Then continue to check in every once in a while to see if you're still breathing correctly.

Doing this for just one week has helped me tremendously, and has me wearing my binder happily for 8 hours a day, while I had trouble wearing it for more than 3 hours before that.

I hope this helps some transfolk out there, and please share this with anyone who might benefit!

2018-12-05 05:21:21,a3972l,4,1,"Hi. Sorry

A lot of stuff is happening all the time and I should be asleep rn, but I need some help. 

I know about the things. Nonbinary, gender fluid, demi boy, demi girl, agender, but then there's new stuff like neurosis and things. I don't know what to do because I feel like I need a name for how I feel- not for my identity, but just something to.. anchor on? Its so late and I'm so tired

The skinny: a fat AFAB. I'm 23. I recently cut off all of my hair in a panic, and the stylist at the LGBTQUIA friendly salon I went to kind of picked up what I was putting down and gave me a rad, intense undercut with just enough hair on the top to pass with a pixie if I'm at work. It's kick ass. That was my second step. My first step- after a dissociative panic attack- was telling my husband that I don't know forreal what my gender is and a traumatic event forced me to question a lot of stuff. 

[TRIGGER WARNING] something kind of traumatic happened to me recently- in october i got a positive pregnancy test and the reaction other than sheer horror was pure revulsion at the capabilities my body had. not only is being pregnant incredibly medically dangerous for my parts, its dangerous for me mentally. I had to terminate before I started experiencing serious, life threatening complications, and my hormones went all over the fucking place and I freaked out rly bad. My psych gave me mood stabilizers and now i have to see a therapist biweekly, but we have to tackle the big stuff before we do little things like my gender

But now I am stuck. I have already ""came out"" to two people, but now I need better words. 

HEre's the thing: If I could build my perfect body, I would be 5'7"", stocky, strong, and not fat. I would have incredibly small breasts that I could cover with a binder whenever I wanted. I would have innie parts, but I would suppress my menstrual cycle and be sterilized. I would have a strong jaw. My hair would always be incredibly short. My clothes would depend on how I felt, I would still get piercings and tattoos and have a horrible sephora problem, but that's it. I don't care what people call me, because I am a body and I put things on the body and it should have no bearing on me as a person. They/Them feels awkward, She/Her I'm neutral to, and He/Him makes me feel squeaky. 

Being told who I am isn't the goal, but some kind of inkling or validation that the way I feel is real, and that other people experience it, and that there's a name for it would help me feel less like I'm faking how I feel. I'm so terrified of being accused of being like, trendy-trans? Idk I saw the word on reddit the other day and I am horrified at the idea of someone thinking being more neutral in my life is like me being a cis woman coming up with a for funnies identity and then go back to being safely cis with my also gender-non-conforming husband. there has to be folks who feel this way",NonBinary,I need to figure some things out and the internet is too big,1544012481.0,"{'created_utc': 1543987281, 'id': 'a3972l', 'num_comments': 4, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Hi.

2018-12-05 20:51:45,a3gg50,2,1,"Hello and thanks for reading! I've been lurking this sub a bit, and it's been very enlightening. However, I keep questioning my gender identity, and I'm beginning to think I'll never understand that part of myself. I was wondering if anyone has any similar experiences or thoughts on the following:

I've been playing with gender nonconformity for years (before I knew I'm bi/pansexual), so I'm very certain that my gender expression is varied. (I'm AFAB and I've worn men's and unisex clothing, participated in drag events, dressed as male characters for cosplay, etc.) Yet I know that expressive activities are separate from identity and may have nothing to do with it. But I am having trouble teasing apart the external influences from the internal feelings. 

For example, I've definitely internalized our culture's body shaming and have a negative self-image, so how can I know if my occasional thoughts about being able to switch up my body (like having smaller breasts or none when I want that) is just another form of self loathing? I've read that many cis people long for body changes as well, so I feel like I can't know my motivation. These feelings are also not persistent and I'm generally able to go about my day without thinking about my body too much.

Another example is when I am dressing in a more masculine or androgynous way, I feel like I can't know if my motivation is to be read as a butch woman, a nonbinary person, or a man. I know I've felt a pang of something when I was dressed more masculine and I asked friends if anyone would think I'm a man and they said it's obvious I'm a woman. But that could be disappointment at outfit failure. I know how I want to dress on any given day, but I don't know why. 

I also can't seem to tease apart my avoidance of the male gaze from my deemphasis on femininity. I don't shave, I don't show off my breasts with padded bras and low cut tops, and I'm often uncomfortable when men are perceiving me as an object or in a sexual way (in high school this manifested as me identifying with ""ugly""). Is my dislike of being overly feminine reactionary to the male gaze or is it related to gender identity?

On the other hand, when I think about not identifying as a woman, I get nervous because I really love women! Saying ""I'm not a woman"" makes me feel like I'm expressing internalized misogyny. I've grown up around heterosexual cis women who prioritize male attention and deprioritize female friendship, so backing out of that identity feels like I'm betraying women. Another aspect of that is that, with my body, I'm always read as a woman and have experienced sexism based on that outward appearance, so I have some particularly formative experiences in common with women and I feel like shared hardships form social bonds.

Another complication is that I've seen cis people online asking some of the same questions I've been asking myself, like ""what is it like to feel female because I just feel like myself?"" And it's because they don't feel incongruity between their identity and appearance. So I feel like if I can't determine if I'm feeling female, it's because I'm cis.

2018-12-06 03:06:53,a3jv76,11,1,"Hi there, 28 they them pronouns here. 

My boss and I were discussing correcting coworkers about my pronouns and she said something that made me kind of uncomfortable. She said that maybe the reason why some people may have problems using my pronouns because they feel as though they're calling me an it. At the time I was kind of mortified so I just kind of nodded or something but I'm mad that I didn't say anything now. 

One of my friends at work whom I really love otherwise was having a hard time remembering in particular. I had a brief one on one conversation in which I explained I wasn't mad but please could she use my pronouns correctly. She apologized and agreed to try to remember. Then later on in the week we had this awkward conversation about my recent job switch to a less public facing position. I was explaining that part of the reason I took the job was because being misgendered over the phone all day was effecting my mental health. she was like..."" You know this is a problem you're going to have your whole life, right?"" And was talking about how I couldn't be hurt by things like that and how she wish she could learn more sensitivity from me and I could take on some of her toughness. 

My coworker is a POC and I know she meant all of this kindly and from a place of solidarity of people who share minority status. My boss was probably just trying to help by explaining a reason why people find using my pronouns difficult. intellectually I can acknowledge this.

In my earlier days I mostly used the too-small sports bra method. Upon discovering this isn't the greatest thing healthwise, I decided to do some research on actual, proper binders.

2018-12-06 19:22:59,a3r97d,4,1,"Hi all,

I was AMAB and I'm strongly considering starting HRT but as I'm not a binary trans woman, I feel like I probably wouldn't want such a high dose, and I'm curious what sort of effects I could see at a lower dose. My principle source of dysphoria is around my hair: I've got a lot of hair on my body and I'm starting to lose it on my scalp. It's crushing because while my ideal presentation is more andro, baldness and body hair is almost always clocked as male. 

On the other hand though, my junk doesn't really give me a lot of dysphoria and I'd like it to keep it's factory standard functionality, so to speak. I've had sex with a binary trans woman and that gave me some perspective on the phenomenon of girl dick. From that experience, and from what I've read from many trans women who have penises, the function of penises changes pretty significantly with HRT. 

So I guess my question is twofold: first, how does a lower dose of HRT effect body and scalp hair? If I take antiandrogens that should slow/stop the hair loss, but will my scalp hair regrow on a low dose of estrogen or do I need high doses to do that?

And second, will low doses of HRT change my penis's functionality? 

Obviously YMMV for everything but I'd like to hear other people's perspectives and experiences to come to informed decisions.

2018-12-09 06:45:22,a4iwk6,51,1,"This isn't a callout for anyone on this sub, it's just something I think about a lot and wanted to post about it. I see it all the time, I've done it, but it seems almost compulsory here and other nonbinary subs and forums to state your assigned gender at birth in almost any introduction or conversation. I looked at a lot of posts where it shows up and see some recurring reasons that break down into a few common categories:

&amp;#x200B;

**QUESTIONING**

* Questioning being trans/nb (""I'm \[AGAB\] but think I might be nb for these reasons..."")
* Not feeling ""enough"" of assigned gender, questioning whether that makes me trans/nb/agender, etc.
* Does being gender nonconforming mean someone is nonbinary? (stating AGAB and gender nonconforming traits)
* Previously identified as binary trans, maybe nb? (Sometimes state AGAB, sometimes binary trans gender or both)

**DYSPHORIA**

* Issues of presentation and expression (too much like AGAB stereotypes, not enough like nb stereotypes, etc.).
* Clothing questions (specifying body type/sizes/dress codes)
* Specific body dysphoria issues based on anatomy.
* Validation (""is it ok that I do this even though my AGAB is \_\_\_? Do I pass?"").
* Socialization (specific gender issues related to upbringing, change in context around old behaviors, etc.).

**MEDICAL**

* Types of medical transition/HRT/surgeries (seeking answers to specific questions about treatments or procedures).
* Diagnostic criteria for specific ailments by biological sex (disclosing AGAB to doctor, etc.).

**SEXUALITY**

* Conflicts with partner's orientation (""I'm \[AGAB\] and my partner is \[orientation\]"")
* Questions about orientation related to transition (""I'm \[AGAB\], can I label myself \[orientation\] even though I'm nb?"").

**SAFETY &amp; INCLUSION:**

* Looking for role models (""Where are all the \[AGAB\] nonbinary people like me??"")
* Exclusion/Inclusion (""I can't find any nonbinary oriented resources for this \[AGAB\] issue"", ""I'm nb, but take up this cause because I'm \[AGAB\]).
* Gender segregation (""There's no binary option and I'm being sorted by my AGAB"").
* Bathrooms (a million versions of this, forever and always)

&amp;#x200B;

All of these categories and examples have valid reasons for getting into someone's AGAB. I have done it myself for many of these reasons and I'm not saying it's never relevant to a conversation to disclose one's assigned gender at birth. Just that so many of these things don't really require us to disclose it and it could be inferred from context if it's actually necessary to understand what's being discussed. If someone is seeking validation, we can validate them without needing to know ANYTHING about them, because every one of us is valid and many of us know those insecurities and how to address them, regardless of AGAB. In other cases, like medical issues, just asking the question directly usually leads to being pointed to relevant and helpful info. If we're discussing issues related directly to someone's assigned gender and their specific issues that are springing from it, it makes sense to disclose it and discuss it (especially when it comes to discrimination, gender segregation, exclusion, etc.). If someone is asking specific questions about the effects or particular hormones or what the recovery time is for a specific surgery, it's usually implied and the relevant answers/experiences can be given without having to state our AGAB. Presentation and anatomy don't equal gender, so we can talk about fashion and anatomy issues without having to disclose every single time, most of us are going to get the context and be able to discuss the issues just fine.

&amp;#x200B;

When we get past these most typical reasons, it seems like it's just a compulsory disclosure. Something like ""Hi, I'm a 25 y/o (AGAB) nonbinary person from Ontario, what's up my enbies?"" and that just seems straight up like making a binary for nonbinary people. I get clocked as my AGAB every day (much to my displeasure and dysphoria), so I really don't want to always automatically put that into the head of someone who can't see it. Maybe other people feel differently about that, I certainly wouldn't begrudge them using gendered language (demi\_\_\_, binary pronouns, etc.) to describe themselves. I just don't like the automatic practice of stating our AGAB and creating a second tier binary, when I've already had that gender assigned to me and enforced on me my whole life. I don't find binary genders to be negative, I just find my experience with being labeled with the one I was assigned to be negative and I don't want to keep attaching it to myself, if at all possible. I understand we all have different backgrounds, issues and challenges, but that's true even within people who are the same assigned gender and nonbinary. We're going to have different experiences with dysphoria, goals for transition, social interactions, orientations, expressions and feelings about ourselves and others in any case.

I see it all the time, I\'ve done it, but it seems almost compulsory here and other nonbinary subs and forums to state your assigned gender at birth in almost any introduction or conversation. I looked at a lot of posts where it shows up and see some recurring reasons that break down into a few common categories:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**QUESTIONING**\n\n* Questioning being trans/nb (""I\'m \\[AGAB\\] but think I might be nb for these reasons..."")\n* Not feeling ""enough"" of assigned gender, questioning whether that makes me trans/nb/agender, etc.\n* Does being gender nonconforming mean someone is nonbinary? (stating AGAB and gender nonconforming traits)\n* Previously identified as binary trans, maybe nb? (Sometimes state AGAB, sometimes binary trans gender or both)\n\n**DYSPHORIA**\n\n* Issues of presentation and expression (too much like AGAB stereotypes, not enough like nb stereotypes, etc.).\n* Clothing questions (specifying body type/sizes/dress codes)\n* Specific body dysphoria issues based on anatomy.\n* Validation (""is it ok that I do this even though my AGAB is \\_\\_\\_? Do I pass?"").\n* Socialization (specific gender issues related to upbringing, change in context around old behaviors, etc.).\n\n**MEDICAL**\n\n* Types of medical transition/HRT/surgeries (seeking answers to specific questions about treatments or procedures).\n* Diagnostic criteria for specific ailments by biological sex (disclosing AGAB to doctor, etc.).\n\n**SEXUALITY**\n\n* Conflicts with partner\'s orientation (""I\'m \\[AGAB\\] and my partner is \\[orientation\\]"")\n* Questions about orientation related to transition (""I\'m \\[AGAB\\], can I label myself \\[orientation\\] even though I\'m nb?"").\n\n**SAFETY &amp; INCLUSION:**\n\n* Looking for role models (""Where are all the \\[AGAB\\] nonbinary people like me??"")\n* Exclusion/Inclusion (""I can\'t find any nonbinary oriented resources for this \\[AGAB\\] issue"", ""I\'m nb, but take up this cause because I\'m \\[AGAB\\]).\n* Gender segregation (""There\'s no binary option and I\'m being sorted by my AGAB"").\n* Bathrooms (a million versions of this, forever and always)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll of these categories and examples have valid reasons for getting into someone\'s AGAB. I have done it myself for many of these reasons and I\'m not saying it\'s never relevant to a conversation to disclose one\'s assigned gender at birth. Just that so many of these things don\'t really require us to disclose it and it could be inferred from context if it\'s actually necessary to understand what\'s being discussed. If someone is seeking validation, we can validate them without needing to know ANYTHING about them, because every one of us is valid and many of us know those insecurities and how to address them, regardless of AGAB. In other cases, like medical issues, just asking the question directly usually leads to being pointed to relevant and helpful info. If we\'re discussing issues related directly to someone\'s assigned gender and their specific issues that are springing from it, it makes sense to disclose it and discuss it (especially when it comes to discrimination, gender segregation, exclusion, etc.). If someone is asking specific questions about the effects or particular hormones or what the recovery time is for a specific surgery, it\'s usually implied and the relevant answers/experiences can be given without having to state our AGAB. Presentation and anatomy don\'t equal gender, so we can talk about fashion and anatomy issues without having to disclose every single time, most of us are going to get the context and be able to discuss the issues just fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen we get past these most typical reasons, it seems like it\'s just a compulsory disclosure.

2018-12-10 00:07:58,a4qbo2,2,1,"hi all!

thanks to this subreddit I've gotten a lot of good info and support here (posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/9ywtnm/did_other_folks_here_not_at_all_question_your/) earlier) and I'm in my phase of gender questioning where I'm starting to embrace the idea of having a Non-binary identity internally, and thinking about slowly starting to come out as either non-binary, non-binary/woman, or gender-questioning to my friends and family.

I'm an AFAB and I've presented as pretty feminine for the majority of my adult life, and having recently come out as bisexual I've started feeling more comfortable dressing a bit more masculine and I probably present as tomboy-esque or an athletic girl who loves Levi's but not necessarily looking obviously androgynous or masculine (although that's my goal internally).

I cut my long hair (was previously about boob length) into a short bob thats about an inch above my chin and my friends and family have been really supportive of my new look. I really love having shorter hair because it makes me feel more tomboyish and like I'm presenting less feminine, but not necessarily pushing the boundaries too boldly all at once, and I wanted to see in a more gradual way how it felt to have shorter hair.

Now that I know I feel really good having shorter hair, I am thinking about the idea of cutting it even shorter, I really love the look of 90's short ""curtains"" type hair style ([see Winona Ryder circa 1992](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/77/8b/a8/778ba82a4740e246ecc86b8856a9a2ae--short-hair-cuts-short-s-hair.jpg)and [Leonardo DiCaprio](https://90sthrowback.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/ldicaprio07_gl_17aug12_rex_b.jpg)) and I like that both men and women wore that hairstyle but it is more of a masculine look IMO.

I was chatting with my mom this morning about my new bob haircut and how she really likes it short, and she was telling me stories about how when she was part of the new wave scene in the 80s her and her friends all had short ""boyish"" hair. I half-jokingly said ""sometimes I think it'd be rad to go full Britney and shave all my hair off"" and she said ""please don't do that"" and that she'd be ""disappointed"" if I ever did because she said she thinks I look really cute and she likes my hair.

The comment hit me more than I expected. It made me feel that coming out as non-binary would be harder than coming out as bisexual to my parents. Even though they are relatively progressive and support the LGBT community at large, her comment made me feel that a lot of her conceptions of me are constructed around the idea that I am her ""daughter"" and all the gendered connotations that come with that, and that coming out as NB might really be a lot for her to handle. Her and my dad have been \*super\* supportive of me since coming out as bisexual, I didn't feel like I had to explain myself or that it changed their view of me at all, but after hearing this comment it made me feel like I would disappoint them if I came out as non-binary or wanted to present more masculine because it made me feel like their idea of me as NB as opposed to ""their girl"" would completely change their view, even though \*I\* know fundamentally I am the exact same person.

Being in my mid-20s with a career and having graduated college already, I normally might not care this much about how my parents might think, but I recently had to quit my job due to a toxic work environment, and I'm living with them right now while I look for new work, and I might be home for a few more months. I don't necessarily \*want\* to put off cutting my hair and other external ways of exploring my identity until I move out, but after hearing my mom's comment I feel like I might have to.

I guess I wanted to hear if other folx on this subreddit have experienced similar situations, where your parents aren't overtly shitty like kicking you out of the house or something, but maybe make passing micro-aggressive comments that make you feel uncomfortable or like you're disappointing them? How do you reconcile their feelings of disappointment with exploring and asserting your gender identity? Did anyone's parents change their mind or come around to being fully supportive after awhile?

TLDR: AFAB been enjoying dressing more adrogynous/masculine than before, mom has been supportive of new look so far I think because I am still within the confines of what is considered ""feminine"" (wearing clothes from women's section, short bob).

I really love having shorter hair because it makes me feel more tomboyish and like I\'m presenting less feminine, but not necessarily pushing the boundaries too boldly all at once, and I wanted to see in a more gradual way how it felt to have shorter hair.\n\nNow that I know I feel really good having shorter hair, I am thinking about the idea of cutting it even shorter, I really love the look of 90\'s short ""curtains"" type hair style ([see Winona Ryder circa 1992](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/77/8b/a8/778ba82a4740e246ecc86b8856a9a2ae--short-hair-cuts-short-s-hair.jpg)and [Leonardo DiCaprio](https://90sthrowback.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/ldicaprio07_gl_17aug12_rex_b.jpg)) and I like that both men and women wore that hairstyle but it is more of a masculine look IMO.\n\nI was chatting with my mom this morning about my new bob haircut and how she really likes it short, and she was telling me stories about how when she was part of the new wave scene in the 80s her and her friends all had short ""boyish"" hair. I half-jokingly said ""sometimes I think it\'d be rad to go full Britney and shave all my hair off"" and she said ""please don\'t do that"" and that she\'d be ""disappointed"" if I ever did because she said she thinks I look really cute and she likes my hair.\n\nThe comment hit me more than I expected. It made me feel that coming out as non-binary would be harder than coming out as bisexual to my parents. Even though they are relatively progressive and support the LGBT community at large, her comment made me feel that a lot of her conceptions of me are constructed around the idea that I am her ""daughter"" and all the gendered connotations that come with that, and that coming out as NB might really be a lot for her to handle. Her and my dad have been \\*super\\* supportive of me since coming out as bisexual, I didn\'t feel like I had to explain myself or that it changed their view of me at all, but after hearing this comment it made me feel like I would disappoint them if I came out as non-binary or wanted to present more masculine because it made me feel like their idea of me as NB as opposed to ""their girl"" would completely change their view, even though \\*I\\* know fundamentally I am the exact same person.\n\nBeing in my mid-20s with a career and having graduated college already, I normally might not care this much about how my parents might think, but I recently had to quit my job due to a toxic work environment, and I\'m living with them right now while I look for new work, and I might be home for a few more months. I don\'t necessarily \\*want\\* to put off cutting my hair and other external ways of exploring my identity until I move out, but after hearing my mom\'s comment I feel like I might have to.\n\nI guess I wanted to hear if other folx on this subreddit have experienced similar situations, where your parents aren\'t overtly shitty like kicking you out of the house or something, but maybe make passing micro-aggressive comments that make you feel uncomfortable or like you\'re disappointing them? How do you reconcile their feelings of disappointment with exploring and asserting your gender identity? Did anyone\'s parents change their mind or come around to being fully supportive after awhile?\n\nTLDR: AFAB been enjoying dressing more adrogynous/masculine than before, mom has been supportive of new look so far I think because I am still within the confines of what is considered ""feminine"" (wearing clothes from women\'s section, short bob).

I‚Äôve been in the closet to my family ever since I realized about 4 or so years ago that I do not fall in the binary, and although realizing that did bring me a lot of peace, it was so scary at the same time. It still is, just thinking about it.

I feel so bad not because I don‚Äôt like being non-binary or I wish I was cis or whatever, but because I hate creating awkward situations, as I‚Äôve always been socially anxious. I used to work retail and after I cut my hair short everyone would read me as a guy and then I‚Äôd speak and they‚Äôd immediately get all flustered and apologize and all this and I would just feel like crap.
Issue is, since society isn‚Äôt going to be changing any time soon, I either need to work through my social anxiety and present how I want, or transition to a ‚Äúmasculine presenting‚Äù appearance and live out the rest of my life presenting as a man, once I graduate college of course...and I‚Äôm not upset with that, I can see myself finding happiness in that future, even if it‚Äôs not what I truly want.

Although  many transgender / non-binary people say that being misgendered is a major source of  stress for them, there is very little research about misgendering. This  study is investigating the ways that people are  misgendered, how these events are similar to and different from one  another, and the impact they have on trans / non-binary people‚Äôs well-being.  Participating in this study may help researchers develop more effective  ways of reducing misgendering.

To be in this study you must:

* be at least 18 years old
* be a fluent in English
* be transgender (including non-binary or genderqueer people)
* have experienced misgendering at least once

Because  other scientists have not done very much research on this topic, no one  has developed multiple choice questionnaires about it. That means this  survey will ask you to give your responses to several questions by  typing your thoughts in sentences. **Most participants will find this is easier and more comfortable to do on a device that has a keyboard.**

This study is expected to take about 20 minutes to complete but this may vary depending on how much you choose to write.

For every complete, unique submission, I will donate $2.00 to TransLifeline, up to 100 participants.

If you have any questions, please feel free to  respond to this post or DM me.

2018-12-11 04:51:50,a53p1o,7,1,"Hi there,

I'm an elementary school teacher (cis female) in a fairly progressive district, and I would really appreciate some help in navigating a situation. I hope it's okay to post here. 

My school has always done a ""gender lunch"" (their words!) with the 5th graders, where they separate them into boy and girl groups to talk about social challenges. I do feel that it's been valuable for a lot of kids, but I also feel that it could potentially be harmful for any students who are questioning their identity, in any capacity. 

So I offered to lead an alternate group that was open to all students, so that they don't feel compelled to go with the group based on their assignment at birth. But I also want to phrase it in a way that doesn't make students feel like they have to make a statement about themselves before they are ready, and so that it is available to a larger group.

I guess the main issue here is that I both want to keep it vague enough for all students to feel comfortable, while also wording it in a way that subverts the binary language and recognizes a spectrum. Could I introduce it as a ""gender neutral"" group without making kids feel like if they come, they aren't singling themselves out? I don't want to say ""mixed group"" because that is exclusive of students who might not identify as either male or female.

I'm hoping to hear from anyone who is willing to share what would have been helpful for them as a 10-11 year old.

A year ago I came out as trans, started taking testosterone (afab) and changed my name/pronouns to masculine ones (in Portuguese we only have gendered language, yay) and went full on r/FTM, but then I started having anxiety attacks and stopped taking T and started to doubt myself.
It feels like I'm in this mental place where I'm stuck between two worlds.

2018-12-12 06:52:50,a5frh1,0,1,"Hey, I had made a post vaguely similar to this a while back but just wanted to follow up after some introspection.

So my gender expression is what most people would consider masculine. I wear men's clothing usually, I don't keep my face clean shaven, etc. And unavoidably, aspects of how I've been socialized lead to some of my traits or behaviors being what one might consider masculine as well.

However, I've always thought that's pretty restrictive. I mean, I also like dresses and nail polish and cute things, and I have a pretty nurturing &amp; empathetic approach toward others, which are traits traditionally lumped in with femininity. Right?

I think I stick with masculine presentation because, well, I'm AMAB so this is easier and usually more comfortable. And honestly if I could dress however I want I'd be wearing a cute dress one day and jeans and flannel the very next day, but I'm absolutely terrified of the social repercussions that would come from that.

To get to the main point, at some point I decided to self-identify as non-binary, but since I look so much like a man it was difficult and confusing for everyone, so I tried to force myself to be less ""male"" to offset it and it just stressed me out. Eventually I felt maybe it would be easier to just say I'm something like demimale so people can call me ""him"" if it's such a big deal to them &amp; I won't have to explain myself to them. But I keep just flip-flopping between thinking ""maybe I'm just a weird man &amp; I should just accept it"" and ""no, I don't think I'm a man or a woman and 'they/them' pronouns make me happy.""

So I guess I have to wonder, am I really non-binary, or am I just a cis man who doesn't like the *roles* or *expectations* associated with being a man? I'm not exactly consistent about it, so it almost makes me think I'm just some cis person who for some reason really wants to be treated as gender neutrally as possible or something?

In general, I think the best advice is to be kind and compassionate to yourself. Cut yourself some slack when things get you down, allow yourself to feel that this is you, that you get to define your feelings and that your feelings are valid. Because they are. Maybe you don't feel that you are reacting in a socially acceptable or 'correct' way, but they are your reactions and your feelings. Take the time to have them before you try to analyse and understand them. Otherwise they become bottled.

Maybe you already have coping strategies, maybe you already have an end-point in mind, maybe you don't. Whatever, research and learn - about the situations you can face and about yourself. Look into how others cope with it. Protect yourself if you have to - so don't do research at work or where others may track what you are doing. But do research. Seek out safe spaces to discuss your feelings on matters.

Maybe doing something that feels affirming will help you out as well. My friend and I created a short documentary film that asks some of these questions to a gender-non-conforming musician and how music and spirituality has played a vital role in their process of dealing with gender dysphoria.

2018-12-12 15:57:26,a5jdi0,0,1,"So today two people in a server I'm in, started a rant about transgender people.

One of the people claimed that trans people are trying to erase the term ""Tomboy"" without any source but one article with obvious trans misinformation.

The other person was upset that trans people asked others to RESPECT their pronouns, and they claimed that people are forcing their beliefs onto them. He continued to then mock and dismiss trans people...before being muted.

The pronoun boy got (only muted) for 24hrs...not banned or anything. And the reason he got muted was not because he was being transphobic...but because he was ""arguing"" 

The ""Tomboy"" person later got into my Dms, trying to explain their perspective, in which they provided an extremeist article and said ""in the liberal age, media is working overtime to kill the word 'tomboy'""

I said that one article doesnt represent a whole generation/media. And that ""I can name a number of people who support trans boys and tomboys who aren libral cucks""

They replied ""Lin, can you stop posting from your emotions. That's not how civil discourse works""
In which I said that nothing they've said has been an actual fact. (Which is true. They never said anything that was true at all especially on a statistical scale.) 

Me: You dont know what trans people want on a ""societal scale""

Have you spoken to more than one trans boy in your life? Have you seen any trans movements go ""Down with dam tomboys yer all evil!""

You do know there are tomboy trans girls right?

Them: you mean tomgirl? Jfc (In which he's assuming trans girls are boys who are femme...and not just girls)

Me: No. Tomboy.
Gender expression isnt gender?
Tomboy is a girl who likes predominantly male shit. Trans women aren't men. Wtf?

And this is where they blocked me. Though before they commited the action they said ""Okay Lin, I don't think you came here for a conversation. I think you came here for a monologue. If you want a monologue, you can have it. Goodbye.""

I had a conversation. 
You came to me.
You started this making baseless claims.
You basically called trans women male and
YOU went out of your way to paint me as insane despite aside from a few curse words, me being very reasonable and civil.

3. What would potentially persuade you to agree more with the other side's interests?

Also not concerned that this is misunderstood dysmorphia; it‚Äôs a case of genital dysphoria.

2018-12-13 05:52:13,a5qqe1,0,1,"I'm having a really hard time accepting myself more and more every day, because I'm scared that I will destroy my relationship. I've been out to myself and very very few people as nonbinary since about May this year. 

&amp;#x200B;

In July my boyfriend asked me if I wanted to be a man because I looked like I was ""hiding my boobs"" and at this time I genuinely thought and explained to him that I just didn't feel like I'm a man nor a woman. He was confused about this, but he was accepting of it, nevertheless I really tried to sugarcoat it and told him that it is completely fine to still use feminine pronouns for me (since we are speaking a very heavily grammatically gendered language without practical options for genderneutral terms) because I was so worried about losing him. I mean I'm still not too picky about what people call me but lately I'm just feeling more and more dysphoria about not just having an amab body. I just look at other guys in my age and all I see is how much I wish I had their body shape and could just been born as one of them. On other days I'm more ok with how I look and feel like I should just accept myself and try to work with the things I have.

&amp;#x200B;

Nevertheless, I just feel more and more like I am lying to myself about how ok everything is and about how I'm fine with being the girlfriend and daughter. I can't relate at all to wlw content but I feel this strange connection to mlm couples. The worst thing about this is probably that I am terribly scared about this because my boyfriend, who I genuinely hope to marry in the future, is very much heterosexual and just can't see himself dating anyone beside a woman. He even asked me if I felt like I'm a man, because he would totally want to support me but he couldn't date me anymore because he's just not attracted to men. I mean that's fine. I can't tell him that he can't be straight just like you can't tell gay people to not be gay, because that's very rude and uncalled for. But it hurts so badly to think that I might never be able to completely deal with it because I will lose the man I genuinely am in love with for over 5 years now if I do so. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also not saying that I feel like I am a man. I just think that I would be happier if I were to have a typically male bone structure and fat distribution but I'm also lucky that I have soft skin and no beard. I also don't see myself starting hrt because I don't really find the changes it could offer me as a 21 year old person whose bones have already fused attractive. I know that I should probably see a therapist but I genuinely don't have the time nor financial needs to do so sadly, since I'm a student without income and very busy with university.

He was confused about this, but he was accepting of it, nevertheless I really tried to sugarcoat it and told him that it is completely fine to still use feminine pronouns for me (since we are speaking a very heavily grammatically gendered language without practical options for genderneutral terms) because I was so worried about losing him. I mean I\'m still not too picky about what people call me but lately I\'m just feeling more and more dysphoria about not just having an amab body. I just look at other guys in my age and all I see is how much I wish I had their body shape and could just been born as one of them. On other days I\'m more ok with how I look and feel like I should just accept myself and try to work with the things I have.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNevertheless, I just feel more and more like I am lying to myself about how ok everything is and about how I\'m fine with being the girlfriend and daughter. I can\'t relate at all to wlw content but I feel this strange connection to mlm couples. The worst thing about this is probably that I am terribly scared about this because my boyfriend, who I genuinely hope to marry in the future, is very much heterosexual and just can\'t see himself dating anyone beside a woman. He even asked me if I felt like I\'m a man, because he would totally want to support me but he couldn\'t date me anymore because he\'s just not attracted to men. I mean that\'s fine. I can\'t tell him that he can\'t be straight just like you can\'t tell gay people to not be gay, because that\'s very rude and uncalled for. But it hurts so badly to think that I might never be able to completely deal with it because I will lose the man I genuinely am in love with for over 5 years now if I do so. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\'m also not saying that I feel like I am a man. I just think that I would be happier if I were to have a typically male bone structure and fat distribution but I\'m also lucky that I have soft skin and no beard. I also don\'t see myself starting hrt because I don\'t really find the changes it could offer me as a 21 year old person whose bones have already fused attractive. I know that I should probably see a therapist but I genuinely don\'t have the time nor financial needs to do so sadly, since I\'m a student without income and very busy with university.

Today, my boss introduced me to a group of visitors and used she/her pronouns in reference to me for the entire conversation. It really threw me off, and each time it happened, it hurt. I was shaky afterward and I felt really down. She apologized to me after (*laugh* ""Sorry, I called you she! I'll do better next time!"") but it felt disingenuous and a little like she was trying to brush past my obvious mood switch. 

She knows I'm non-binary. I told her directly and I sent out an email to everyone at work. I asked everyone to use they/them pronouns for me, even when speaking to clients or colleagues. She hasn't used my pronouns once. Not even to try it out. She uses my name frequently instead. Does that bother anyone else when people do this? I know some prefer no pronouns, but to me it feels like she's saying they/them is too tricky so she's not going to try. 

When I first came out to her, she said she didn't know how to use they/them pronouns so I explained. She was confused (I'm guessing it's the age-old ""but you're only one person"" crap) but said she'd figure it out. In my email, I gave examples and I linked a couple articles that helped explain how to use my pronouns. I'm frustrated now. I've tried to help but she's not practicing or even trying. I would be okay with her making mistakes if I felt like she was trying. This is not the first time she misgendered me at work, but it is the first time that she acknowledged it and kind of apologized. Am I overreacting by still being angry?

2018-12-13 16:15:29,a5uw7x,3,1,"Hey! I have lately been questioning to what extent I should identify as non-binary, and I figured it might help to discuss the relevant points here.

I go by she/her(s) and it/it(s) pronouns, and I have questions about my binarity along axes naturally associated with each. (Relevant background information: I am AMAB and out/hormonally-socially transitioning as a trans woman, though that is going worse than I would prefer.)

**Regarding ‚Äúit‚Äù pronouns:**

A lot of people I see explaining their preference for it/it(s) pronouns insist that they cannot give any interesting account of what they like about them: they are simply the pronouns that feel best. This is not the case with me. I very much enjoy being thought of as a sort of instrument or device or engine for producing my academic-intellectual work. My joke is that I am a machine for converting junk food into philosophy. This certainly is not a way of being binarily gendered, but neither is it really an expression of *gender* dysphoria; it‚Äôs something more like mode-of-being dysphoria. So I don‚Äôt know to what extent this warrants being called non-binary.

**Regarding ‚Äúshe‚Äù pronouns:**

I really, really like being a girl. I like being a girl (I think) as such: I do not think that I am euphoric about certain personal and psychological dimensions of mine having values that place me within the ‚Äúgirl‚Äù range; I have little notion as to what this would even involve. The desirability of girlhood is primitive‚Äîor at least so it seems. 

And yet... I consistently find that I am uncomfortable with a lot of even very basic aspects of fem presentation. The thought of wearing a bra or makeup makes me wince, and the thought of looking in the mirror to see someone indistinguishable from a Typical Cis Girl in bodily appearance and presentation, while preferable to that of seeing my current testosterone-fashioned reflection, still sounds like looking at myself in a costume. The one time I tried getting a fem-ish haircut, looking in the mirror became difficult. (More so than usual, that is.)

I also think I experience straightforward genital euphoria about my dick. The thought of waking up to find a surgeon had covertly given me free MTF SRS sounds horrifying: the body I would have would in some visceral sense be *not mine*.

There‚Äôs also the matter that my gender euphoria is specifically euphoria (I think) about *trans*femininity. I sometimes think, when I‚Äôm being consistently misgendered, that it might have been worth it if given the choice, Myth of Er-like, to be born a cis girl, just to avoid this intense dysphoria about masculinity. But I still seem to consider it a *cost*: being a cis woman would be, as such, a bad thing for me, a misfortune. And indeed, the moment of despair usually ends fairly quickly: it would *not* have been worth it to be born cis and AFAB. 

But on the other hand... I worry that I am conflating gender dysphoria with preferred manner of female presentation, or being female with having a vulva rather than a penis, or being a woman with being a cis woman. I don‚Äôt know that any of this indicates as such that I am not a binary woman.

****

Anyway, that is the long and short of my situation. It sounds nice to be an enby: androgyny is super cool and hot (ugh, horrible pun not intended but very much apologise for); I get happy thinking of showing off the non-binary flag; and I usually feel more political, cultural, and personal kinship with non-binary trans people than the sort of arch-binary ones one can find on certain mainstream trans subteddits. 

But on the other hand... I worry that I am being appropriative, and in any event there is nothing really urgent about answering this question: it‚Äôs unlikely to affect my HRT or already nonstandard pronoun requests or presentation.

2018-12-14 01:36:57,a603m9,28,1,"I'm quite confused over the use of the plural pronouns in a day and age where coining a word for use in everyday language happens regularly. I have had little luck being able to find out why they/them were chosen to represent an individual who is non-binary. 

My question is, instead of using they and them which lacks grammatical sense of singular or plural, but means plural, why not something like chee (enunciated like chƒì) and shou (enunciated like sh≈ç)? Chee and Shoo are just two things I thought of off the top of my head, the words could be anything. I do, though, have a story for how I came up with chee and shou. 

By having unique words it would prevent problems regarding grammer. This could also assist in international adoption when being translated into other languages.

In brackets are my words I made up that could be used in a singular fashion and removes confusion when saying something like ""(chee)they went to the bathroom"".

Or ""have you seen them(shou)"" as it still implies multiple people when ""them"" is used. This would likely assist with adoption the into mainstream as more people would likely be inclined to accept a new word instead of redefining something that has long been accepted as a plural way of identifiying a group of persons. This would also give non-binary people a unique way to identify. 

Ultimately my question surrounds... Why not make a more appropriate word for identifying as an individual instead of calling them ""them"" a group of persons when referring to them?

But none of it ever seemed too natural. Despite how much it seems to invade my life as of late, my gender identity is just a comparatively small part of my overall identity.

I want to make friends based on shared interests and because they compliment my personality; not just because we share similar difficulties in life. But as soon as you're a male who puts on a dress, that's all everyone remembers you for. If someone sees you who doesn't know you it's how they'll refer to you to someone else. People you do know start tip-towing around what they say because they'll afraid they'll offend you. I'd rather them just speak freely and if once and a blue moon it's hurtful I let them know and we move on.

It feels wrong to just fit the norms of what people all of a sudden expect out of you. So I invent or invest in other parts of myself. Some of it bad some of it good.

so im fourteen year old person who feels like they have dysphoria (or dysmorphia), let me get specific skip over if any  
mention of vague amab trans related body discomfort (in italicize) might be a trigger of stress or other unneeded/unhealthy mental health issues;

*-hips; 24/7 i feel a huge discomfort in my size of my hips or lack there of*

*-face; 24/7 as well i get a huge discomfort in the way my face can be persevered as masculine when i want more androgynous way*

*-crotch; i feel that at my genitals at times are not mine, not as ""oh i feel like i need a bigger package"", but ""i dont want my genitals to be male, and sometimes no genitals for that matter,""*

*-hair; 24/7 on my dads side my family is known for very hairy bodies, i am dark haired so the hair on my arms, legs, chest, armpits, ect. stands out more predominantly then another persons hair might be. when i first shaved my arms one month ago my family all asked why and my mom said, quote ""dont do it agian its weird, do you want to be known as the one haired man?"" even though she knows my hair is a large discomfort.*

*-hands and feet- once every day i know this is weird but every day when i look at my hands (or feet when bare foot or in sandals) they feel like im looking at someone else doing what im thinking and is a traditional manly man with testosterone and car oil coarsening through his veins.*

*-adams apple; 24/483784 every day i look at my neck and see this bump a nonexistent bump that i cant see but feel when i run my hand up my throat to see if somehow it dispersed*

*-socialyl; 24/7 words like; sir, handsome, manly, boy, man, son, nephew ect and my birth pronouns; he/him give me great distress and discomfort when directed at me. and would prefer they/them pronouns and less gendered names and expressions to be used for me.*

OKAY for anyone who made it this far I say thank you, so now here is a couple of questions that have been in my head for a while and by no means do I want you to answer all of them at once, but to figure out who i am could you possible answer one of them?

1. how could an a.m.a.b nonbinary person start to transition to a more androgynous body type
2. any small ways to make myself feel feminine or androgynous while not outing myself to family and friends
3. possible people who are (or were) in my similar situation that i could research and use as a ""role model""
4. how to figure a name that is less gendered then my birth name
5. and how to slowly integrate hints that i might not be in the gender norm at all into my friends and family mind

a little more backstory.... sorry.

at this time i am out as gay to all others besides my dad (other family as well as friends)

has dressed in old giveaway clothes my sisters were giving away when no one was home (dresses, heels, and bras)

have been wanting to grow out and paint my nails

have wanted to wear makeup outside of theater and sometimes hallowen

have told 5 people i want to use they them pronouns and identifies as something outside of the label of male.

22 AFAB, come to realise that I relate to the nonbinary label due to meeting and dating some AFAB NB people and coming to some realisations, such as realising that I've been experiencing some dysphoria over my chest/general femininity for a long time.

Honestly being called she/her does not make me super uncomfortable, I'm used to it at this point and I'm more androgynous than masc, but I prefer they/them. So the right language is being used, and so people won't make assumptions about me. I'd also like to go by a more neutral name, quite similar to my birth name.

However, I don't want to 'cause a fuss' by doing this, because I don't feel like I'm uncomfortable enough to justify the issues it would cause. I have supportive friends, and my mum would be supportive, but I know for a fact a lot of people would think it was a ""snowflake"" attention type thing, and I don't want to deal with their reactions. :( My dad and stepmother don't believe in gender identities outside the binary. They are fine with FTM or MTF and wouldn't disown me, but they would definitely dismiss it and wouldn't call me they/them or a chosen name, and it'd be uncomfortable and awkward.

I'm even worried about telling an AFAB NB person I'm dating that I prefer they/them pronouns, in case they felt like I was appropriating their identity (even thought they obviously won't). I feel like I must not be NB enough for it to be worth it or for people to believe me and that I'm not just attention-seeking, if that makes sense.

2018-12-18 19:05:20,a7e2sp,7,1,"So...lately I've been feeling more on the non-binary side of things. What started triggering these feelings was by picking up a book with two people who had backgrounds in living and being taken as women who were often confused for men and who began to feel, through their own experiences and conclusions, felt that they didn't identify with either male or female and were most comfortable as identifying as they/them (Gender Failure by Ivan Coyote and Rae Spoon, in case anyone was wondering). 

That resonated with me a lot, particularly in their stories of growing up. I'm...a pretty masculine woman. 6""3, gender-neutral birth name, built like a rugby player, and because of my size I wear a lot of unisex clothes. And because of all of the above, I have often been confused for a man, or simply gotten the question ""are you a boy or girl"" a LOT. I used to be hurt by it and correct the person, but eventually I gave up and started answering by shrugging and walking away. 

But here's the thing, though. There's a part of me that can't help but wonder if I'm being pushed towards the middle because of experiences like this and not because of a strong relation to the non-binary identity. It almost feels like that because people see a big question mark when they see me that I'm wondering if I should just, you know, say fuck it and embrace it, become essentially what they say I am. 

Another factor I'm wondering about is mental health. I gots depression, anxiety, and PTSD and, without getting into huge details about it, a lot of self-hate stemming from bullying and lifelong emotional abuse. As a result I sabotage myself constantly and try to minimize my presence as much as possible. So I can't help but feel if identifying as non-binary might be a bad-lizard-brain subconscious desire to erase any distinctive attributes to my existence, which is TOTALLY wrong and not good in the slightest, both in terms of my self-hate and of what being non-binary actually is.

I don't know...I don't know what I'm asking here. I've just been internalizing this battle in my head and I just needed to get it out into the void. Thanks for reading, anyone who did.

And to be clear, I'm working on me to figure this out. In therapy for mental stuff and working on various presentations to see how the hell I feel. I have a lot to work out.

2018-12-19 21:08:38,a7qlrh,6,1,"I spent all of my adolescence horribly frustrated with my femme, curvy body. I've mostly gotten over it and I'm pretty okay with being gendered female now. I look female so it makes sense and I don't necessarily feel at odds with femininity, but like... there's always been something that feels a little off. Every once in a while I'll catch myself thinking, ""Oh, if I was a woman..."", or being outright puzzled as to who people are referring to when they use she/her for me. I'll think, ""Is there a she/her around?"" before I realize it's me. I've only been gendered as male once, when I first cut my hair short, and I was so happy when it happened, but it's unlikely to ever happen again unless I go on T because I have such a high-pitched voice and large breasts/hips. I don't really wanna go on T, I don't want facial hair or anything, and it's too much trouble. I don't even want to bother trying to pass as non-binary/male either, it's a lot of effort given my appearance and doesn't really work.

I'm also pansexual and especially attracted to GNC people so to some extent, I can't help but wonder if it's primarily an aesthetic/cultural identity for me. I don't even have much dysphoria anymore honestly. I can look at my body without disgust, I don't care about pronouns, and it's easiest for me to present female so that's what I do. I feel like a fake compared to other trans binary people I know because for them it seems like a really strong internal force whereas for me at this point it's more that I keep forgetting that I'm seen as female. So I was gonna ignore the way I felt, but someone I know recently changed their Facebook pronouns to ""they"" and I spent half an hour crying over it.

I guess I know I'm non-binary, I just... don't really want to deal with the reality of it. I don't want to change my pronouns even if it would feel better because it feels like far too much effort having to correct people, but I figure I won't even be seen as valid if I keep using she/her. I barely even mention I'm pansexual/bisexual anymore to straight people because I got sick to death of having to explain myself whenever I came out. And I know I'll have to break up with my straight boyfriend once I tell him I'm non-binary. There's no way my old-school Catholic parents are going to be okay with it either.

I\'ve mostly gotten over it and I\'m pretty okay with being gendered female now. I look female so it makes sense and I don\'t necessarily feel at odds with femininity, but like... there\'s always been something that feels a little off. Every once in a while I\'ll catch myself thinking, ""Oh, if I was a woman..."", or being outright puzzled as to who people are referring to when they use she/her for me. I\'ll think, ""Is there a she/her around?"" before I realize it\'s me. I\'ve only been gendered as male once, when I first cut my hair short, and I was so happy when it happened, but it\'s unlikely to ever happen again unless I go on T because I have such a high-pitched voice and large breasts/hips. I don\'t really wanna go on T, I don\'t want facial hair or anything, and it\'s too much trouble. I don\'t even want to bother trying to pass as non-binary/male either, it\'s a lot of effort given my appearance and doesn\'t really work.\n\nI\'m also pansexual and especially attracted to GNC people so to some extent, I can\'t help but wonder if it\'s primarily an aesthetic/cultural identity for me. I don\'t even have much dysphoria anymore honestly. I can look at my body without disgust, I don\'t care about pronouns, and it\'s easiest for me to present female so that\'s what I do. I feel like a fake compared to other trans binary people I know because for them it seems like a really strong internal force whereas for me at this point it\'s more that I keep forgetting that I\'m seen as female. So I was gonna ignore the way I felt, but someone I know recently changed their Facebook pronouns to ""they"" and I spent half an hour crying over it.\n\nI guess I know I\'m non-binary, I just... don\'t really want to deal with the reality of it. I don\'t want to change my pronouns even if it would feel better because it feels like far too much effort having to correct people, but I figure I won\'t even be seen as valid if I keep using she/her. I barely even mention I\'m pansexual/bisexual anymore to straight people because I got sick to death of having to explain myself whenever I came out. And I know I\'ll have to break up with my straight boyfriend once I tell him I\'m non-binary. There\'s no way my old-school Catholic parents are going to be okay with it either.

So I think the vast majority of us on this sub would agree that sex and gender are completely separate entities, right?  I personally also think that a person could identify as nonbinary and be completely comfortable with their birth genitals.  Further adding separation to gender and sex.  So if that person is completely fine with their body and how it is seen, can there also be nonbinary people who their gender is nonbinary but they feel their sex is not correct?  

For example, an AFAB nonbinary identifying person feeling their gender is, say, agender, but feeling that their sex should have been male?  So they medically transition to have male genitals but still feel they are a nonbinary person gender-wise?

Sorry if this is confusing, it's hard to figure out how to articulate my question. Also I'm kind of old so I apologize if some of my terminology may be outdated.  Feel free to correct me to more appropriate language in comments.

2018-12-21 01:34:22,a850fa,2,1,"In two weeks, I will be seeing an endocrinologist about possibly starting hormones.  My hope is to start on anti-androgen and see how that feels, and then decide whether I want to start estrogen later.  The doctor I am going to see is in a big medical practice with a lot of different kinds of specialists.  I actually already go there to see a different endocrinologist for my thyroids, as well as a general practitioner (but I go somewhere else to see a psychiatrist).

&amp;#x200B;

I am somewhat concerned that I might run in to some sort of gatekeeping before I can start hormones.  I don't know anything about the doctor I am going to see beyond what is on her public profile, so my worry may be completely baseless, but that doesn't stop me from worrying.  I have known there were some things I really disliked about my body for a long time.  However, it didn't really occur to me until about a year ago that it might be gender related.  I'm 24, and I can easily imagine some people saying that that is too old for me to ""suddenly"" realize that I am trans.

&amp;#x200B;

For a long time, I've known that I really hate having hair on my face, or chest, or in my crotch.  Also, I hate erections, and I'm not fond of balls.  On the other hand, I'm really not sure how I would feel about having breasts.  That's part of why I want to start anti-androgens but am still unsure about estrogen.  

&amp;#x200B;

Between 5th and 7th grade, I had very long and very thick hair.  I started puberty late, so during that time I was also very short, had a high pitched voice, and no facial hair.  People my age who I met for the first time usually viewed me as a boy, but people my parents' age usually assumed I was a girl.  At the time it didn't really bother me one way or the other, but it agitated my parents to no end.  Nowadays I don't think I could pass as a woman or even really androgynous, due to my voice and the shape of my body.

&amp;#x200B;

Though I don't really feel comfortable with gender roles, there is one male stereotype that I have completely embraced: I do not like thinking about clothes.  I don't like shopping for clothes, or trying them on and having them not fit, or picking out which clothes I am going to wear in the morning, or making sure the clothes I am going to wear are washed and dry.  I want clothes that keep me warm, but aren't too hot, don't itch, cover up the parts of my body that I hate, don't restrict my movement too much, and have pockets.  And I don't like thinking about having to find clothes that do all of those things.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also frustrated by the fact that ""men's"" shorts and occasionally ""men's"" long pants are the only pants that have big pockets.  Even skorts that I've tried after hearing they supposedly had ""big pockets"" have small pockets in comparison to ""men's"" shorts.  I am somewhat afraid that my decision to continue wearing men's clothing could lead someone to say that I'm ""not trans enough"" to get hormones.  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have tried wearing false breasts both at home and outside (but not at work), and I feel fairly neutral about them.  But, then, I need to wear them with a bra, which is an extra article of clothing that I have to think about.  With my body shape and size, I have been unable to find any strap bras that actually fit.  I have found a few sports bras that sort-of kind-of fit me, though.  

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhow, as I said at the beginning of this post, my fears may be completely baseless.  I may walk away from my appointment in two weeks with a prescription for anti-androgen without any fuss.  And even if I don't, I have the means to go to another doctor's practice, albeit it will involve more unpleasant delays.  I really just wanted to vent right now.

2018-12-21 05:22:17,a86pqm,2,1,"Most of my friends up until now have been made through the one friend I made at 11. It's been kind of a six degrees of separation deal where everyone I know is a friend of a friend of a friend of this first friend spanning a decade. 

The past year or so we've lived in different cities so my (already light) social life basically disappeared. Luckily, through the people I knew (again through friend one) I've been able to get regularly booked for shows and other art stuff in town (i'm a musician). 

A friend of a friend had been following me through shows and posts about my shows and explicitly stated she wanted to be my friend bc she liked my vibe. It was great on so many levels. 

Firstly, she was so upfront about wanting to be my friend and know me more. No guesswork! üòÉ And since she knew me through my special interests (music, performance, fashion, art in general) she would always engage me based on that! 

Secondly, I've been struggling with gender identity and my almost exclusively VERY video-game-dude-bro str8 guy friends were causing me a lot of dysphoria. Not because of anything they do or say to me - they're actually great &amp; part of our larger social circle which is largely LGBT - but when I'm with them I'm seen as a dude just like them and I end up acting that way because of involuntary masking. 

This new friend - Ill call her Sunny - immediately acknowledged me as someone who is NB and very femme. One of our first long text conversations was just us trading looks from The Met Gala and talking about what we think of them. She invited me to a party and there she introduced me to some more of her girl friends and included me in planning a girls night! 

Since then we've been dropping compliments on each other's selfies and we've had another outing to THE LIBRARY!! (nice n quiet!) and a park (doGS!) and she was into it when I wanted to just watch a turtle for a bit. 

And she also has anxiety so we've been able to connect over that! 

I'm so used to feeling excluded (often unintentionally) by the people I want to be around due to either my low social energy and awkwardness or because I'm not seen as ""one of the girls"" (usually it's not the girls who don't want me around; it's the guys not wanting to be around the girls and wanting/expecting me to come with them) and I'm just feeling so valid right now as both a non binary individual and as an autistic adult and I'm excited for the future! 

TL;DR: 

I made/am maintaining a friendship by myself for the first time in my adult life. It's a scary adventure and I don't know how people do it and it's great.

2018-12-22 03:41:15,a8hidr,3,1,"I don't know what my body is supposed to look like, but it's not this.

Right now, that's all I know. I look at page after page of pictures under the ""androgyny"" tag, and I see what I wish my body looked like. They are all white, they are all thin, they are all delicate and fragile. Their tits are small, their hips are narrow, their faces have jaws and cheekbones that could cut glass. Their eyes are huge and deep, ageless. They look like elves or angels, and I want to look like them, and I never, ever will.

That's not self-loathing, that's not pessimism, that's straight-up fucking biology. I am five-ten and burly - not six-two and willowy, not five-four and curvy. I am 190 pounds of soft muscle and hard fat. I have never broken a bone because my bones are as thick as tree limbs, my wrists too large to grip in one hand. My ass is big and firm but not shapely. My thighs are horselike with no gap in between, my arms are strong but too soft for any muscle definition. My tits are big but partly because my chest is thick, barrel-like - it gives me a deep voice and makes me pop buttons on shirts when I breathe, in a way that is not sexy and scandalous but just embarrassing and expensive.

Looking at these pictures makes me feel exactly how I've felt all my life - slow, clumsy, misshapen, as if I'm interacting with the world through a spacesuit. Most days it feels like I can't truly touch anything, like every motion is a fumbling approximation of what I intended, like every sense is dull and muffled. When I look in the mirror I can see myself in the eyes - well, not in them, but behind them. The eyes aren't shaped right, they're not the right color, they're not mine, but behind the face I don't recognize I see my own fear looking out. That's been the same all my life. I can't ever remember seeing a face in the mirror that looked like mine.

Right now, it feels like it's the having of a face at all that I resent. I spent today looking up local ordinances on the wearing of masks in public. I'd like to assemble a collection of beautiful masks, all different, that I could choose from when I go out and wear all day. I hate the feeling that participating in daily life requires taking a stand on who I am as a person. I would like to go out in a voluminous robe and a mask, so that what I say and do is just what I say and do, not what a WOMAN says and does, not what a MAN says and does... I do not want to be assigned a category and I don't want to prop one up by existing. But it seems that I don't have a choice. There is no way to opt out of people looking at you and assigning you a role based on the first fucking characteristic they see.

Thirty years of first-person gaming and silent protagonists have taught me that the essential ME is in my hands. They're the only part of myself I like. They're the only parts of me that look exactly like they should, the only parts I enjoy watching do what they do. They're neither masculine nor feminine, and they're not pretty - I bite my nails and chew my fingertips until they bleed. But none of that matters when they're writing, or cooking, or drawing. All that matters is that they're sure and strong and they've never failed to do as I asked.

I've always talked to people best when we walk side-by-side, not looking at each other. I've always done best online, in text, where my voice doesn't interfere with what I have to say. I don't want to have a face. I don't want to have a voice. I just want to bring the quest item and turn it in, and be judged on the basis of how well I did the thing.

It's hard to see a way out of dysphoria right now. I can't think of any shape within my physical capacities that I would like better than the one I have. I love having long hair and I love having tits, but I could take or leave the bottom system if I'm honest. I want to have a baby and do mom things.

2018-12-22 08:32:33,a8j9im,7,1,"I'm AMAB and currently identifying as non-binary. I'm 19, and since I was 14/15, have been on-off identifying as NB. 

To list the reasons I feel NB:  


I get social dysphoria. I hate being called a ""man"". I get extremely uncomfortable being grouped in with men.I hate having male gender roles pushed upon me. I hate being called ""handsome"". I love, on the flip side, being called ""beautiful"", ""cute"", ""pretty"", ect. The social dysphoria can get to the point it makes me depressed enough to cry or very irate. This is the only way to instantly ruin my mood and make me extremely upset.

I get what I assume is physical dysphoria. I absolutely loathe my body and facial hair. I'm slender, but I know if I started bulking up and developing a more masculine frame, I'd hate it.

I looooove having long hair. (Not that men can't have long hair! I just know with me it's partially because it adds to making me look androgynous/less so masculine.) I hate having short hair.

I know gender expression and identity are two separate things, but it's worth mentioning I'm a very feminine person. 

I hate masculine clothes. The only clothes I've ever felt comfortable in are androgynous styles. Men's clothes often accentuate the masculinity in my frame and make me hate my body.

I'm at my happiest presentation wise when I'm androgynous. I love the idea of people not knowing my gender from a glance. There were times in my life that I was confused for female even, and that made me happy. I felt androgynous because of it.

I like to do drag, and it goes beyond performance art for me. It feels AMAZING, euphoric, even. to look in the mirror and see myself, in feminine/androgynous clothes, makeup that feminizes my face/makes it androgynous. 

Lastly, I just don't feel male. When I think of myself I often see myself as not belonging to any gender wholly. When I see men, I just... don't feel like I'm the same as them? I'm not ""one of the guys"", nor do I want to be.

&amp;#x200B;

Reasons I don't feel valid:

&amp;#x200B;

I still find that despite belonging to either category, that, if you drew a line, and put male on the left end, and female on the right end, then put your finger in the direct middle, and moved slightly to the left, that'd be where I'm at. 

I like he/him pronouns.

I'm more comfortable in a male body (ideally an androgynous one, but whatever)

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like, because I'm a bit closer to male on the spectrum (even though it's really not by a lot), and the that that means a part of me is still male, that I'll never be a valid NB person.

 I feel like, at the same time, I am not male, nor female, and experience a mixture of both, neither, and something completely different.

1. Ironically, my first introduction to the NB gender was a DoseOfBuckley video(I was at a horrible genderist anti SJW phase back then), in it he argues, ""why can't you just be a guy who's into makeup, nail polish and sports"" or something like that. I think he's saying why can't you just be a dude who's into masculine, feminine, and/or in-between and still be called a guy/gal. What is your counter argument to this?

2. While watching NB videos, I saw this one about a person who claims they were AFAB and then a trans male and then as a NB. They then said, ""If I was born male, I would be happy"". Being AMAB, I displayed often feminine traits but I also did things society has accepted to be male oriented. Sometimes, if I was born female, I would've been NB at some point(funny enough, I did had dysphoria about being female when I was 13). But I also noticed some trans people talking about potential in successful surgery of a man getting vaginal parts(or the other way around). Which gives me the question, if hormone therapy(or surgery) could advance to the point where people can successfully identify as a new gender and sex(ones that fall under male and female), would NB as well as the other genders be considered of no use anymore(not saying that out of hate against the multiple genders, I'm just curious)?

3. Since I'm AMAB, a lot of my family and peers has used he pronouns to identify me. I haven't told them I'm NB yet, and I don't want to, because I feel like it could cause a lot of confusion and chaos amongst them since they accepted this genderist idea of only 2 binary genders. It doesn't help either that most of them are likely transphobic. Despite this, I want any newcomer I come across with to use they pronouns instead. Are you in a situation similar to this?

I don't expect much, but I want to give them a chance. And most importantly I want them to find out on my terms.



&gt;Dear Mom and Dad,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I have to explain something to you about myself, because it is very important to me and I am going through changes that have distinctly improved my life, happiness, and sense of self. ¬†¬†I know you care about and love me, and I want to be authentic and honest with you and all the other people I care most about. 
&gt;
&gt;For several years now I have been quietly questioning my identity and reflecting on the ways I view myself and how I would most like to interact with the world. ¬†I have come to the conclusion that I am gender non-binary, which means that I don't fit into fixed male/female definitions of gender. I also am transfeminine, meaning that although my personal sense of gender is not entirely female, overall my identity is more feminine than the male gender I was assigned to at birth.
&gt;
&gt;My gender does not inherently change anything about who I was or am, apart from the name, pronouns, and terms used to describe me and talk about me. In being honest and open about my gender I am not changing anything about who I am, but only trying to be more authentically myself in all my relationships. What clothes I choose to wear or how I present my body is an expression of fashion and personal taste and not an indication of my gender.
&gt;
&gt;This year I have started taking hormone replacement medication and this has done more good for me in a few months than any changes I have tried to make in the past several years. ¬†I feel much more in touch with myself and who I‚Äôm meant to be. And I have chosen a name for myself that better reflects who I am. However both of these parts of my transition have not changed who I am, because this is who I always was, even if no one could see it with their eyes.
&gt;
&gt;Here are things I need you to know: ¬†I do not feel comfortable being referred to by traditionally male pronouns (he/him/his/himself), but ask that others refer to me as they/them/their/themself. ¬†I also ask that you use gender neutral terms for me whenever applicable, such as ‚Äúchild‚Äù instead of ‚Äúson‚Äù and so on. If you‚Äôre unsure about what terms to use, you can ask me and I am happy to help. ¬†I understand that these changes for how to talk about me may be confusing at first and it will take some time to adjust, especially when it comes to my chosen name; but what matters most to me is the willingness and effort to learn and use them.
&gt;
&gt;I would love and appreciate your support, however I know what the LDS faith tells you about gender. ¬†I will neither go out of my way to persuade you of what you should believe nor will I argue with you about my validity. ¬†I am aware there are narratives your church has for how I ‚Äúbecame‚Äù this way; I unequivocally reject all of them. I sincerely hope that you will come to look past what others have told you your child should conform to so that you may see me as I truly am. Transitioning is not something I started lightly, nor is it something I was tricked or deceived into doing; it has taken me over four years to reach this point, and I have talked to multiple therapists and doctors about it. ¬†Again, this is not a matter for debate. I will not tolerate abusive behavior, bad faith, or contentiousness about my identity. I am not telling you what you have to believe, but I am telling you where my boundaries are. The choice to transgress those boundaries is yours alone. How I respond to breaches of my boundaries is mine.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I know this all may sound strange and uncertain; it‚Äôs completely normal to experience strong emotions when a loved one transitions, but this is important and necessary to me. ¬†Therefore I ask that you take some time to carefully consider what I've written and how you would like to respond, and to first respond back via letter or email before we talk directly. ¬†I am not expecting this to be easy for either you or me. But if you are willing to act in good faith towards me, I am willing to hear what you have to say.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Love,
&gt;Your oldest child

Part of me thinks I should just not care what they call me and be ok with it not meeting gender expectations, especially when they refer to me to others who haven't met me yet...but it does bother me. Lots of conflicting feelings. Has anyone else had to deal with this? Should we just pick something and stick with it until it feels familiar? Whatever the case, the little one will pick up whatever we use, as they're not even really talking yet (though they understand a lot), but I'd have to talk through any change with my oldest and get him on board."", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Struggling with what my kids should call me.', 'created': 1545647977.0}"

2018-12-24 06:41:36,a92ndw,6,1,"Hi, 

I am masculine nonbinary. I identify as something that is not really a man or a woman (androgynous), but tend a little towards the masculine side I think because I am more comfortable with 'he' and more of the secondary male sexual characteristics(still not all of them) than female. 

I started transitioning to male by taking testosterone, and for the first few years this went pretty nice, as there was still a good deal of androgyny retained while I could still pass as 'he'. After about 3 years on it, I started feeling dysphoria the other way, such as feeling my face is too masculine, and having women hit on me, which I discovered I really don't like at all (I'm asexual/but this possibly has something to do with my gender, too?) Also my hair is falling out, which, if in a male pattern would completely obliterate any possibility of ambiguity and my hair is one of the main ways I express this ambiguity, so I really don't feel like I could feel ok without it. Also I was abused by someone with male pattern baldness, so I would really like to not be reminded of that every time I look in the mirror. It's pretty much not an option for me, I've realized. To complicate things further, having more estrogen than testosterone in my system makes me drastically more vulnerable to severe states of depression, even if you don't factor in bodily dysphoria and the social aspect of it. I've tried lowering my dose of t; it still tends to rapidly cause depression, even if it's lowered slightly, and I really don't think lowering the dose would stop the changes I would like to stop, only slow them down. For these reasons, I am considering going off T entirely. I can probably find ways to deal with depression or increase my masculinity, such as working out my upper body and keeping my body fat percentage low,  but I can't get my androgynous hairstyle back if it is lost. I also can't deal with other things that cause the masculine side of the dysphoria....its a bit harder for me to pin point than the feminine side of it but its very real. So...

I'm thinking of stopping T. I know it's going to be hell, but I already have a beard and top surgery and naturally have very small hips. I also am a very small person, usually perceived as 'delicate' and 'extra feminine' somehow purely due to my size when not on T. I don't know how well I will still pass, but I would figure I would still be viewed as at least androgynous. The main thing that really freaks me out is the depression, body fat redistribution if I put on weight (seems to be fairly manageable if I stay very thin - like not emaciated anorexia thin but pretty damn thin - don't know how maintainable this is my whole life ) Anyone have any insight or possible alternatives? I've tried certain products to prevent mpb but it either irritates my scalp and makes my hair fall out, or is more feminizing in certain ways (like at the hips) than my endogenous estrogen even is, so it's pretty intolerable. I feel like if I could stop T and at least be seen as ambiguous most of the time and not purely feminine, then I could be ok and find some way to deal with the depression.

I have my first gender therapy appointment this Thursday. I think when I get home from that and my partner asks how my first session went (which he totally will) I'll bring it up.  I'm just swimming in my own thoughts in the meantime.  

Really, I feel like I'm 100% ready to transition even if that means my partner doesnt find me sexually attractive anymore. I think hes the one who needs the support system but hes so busy I have no idea when he would make the time.  I'm just.  So ready.  But even when I changed my name I took things slow for his sake and I really dont think I can do that anymore.

Not that we'd break up or anything.  I just cant hold his hand and soften every aspect of this for him.  That's too much for one person who's also transitioning.

Everywhere I look are people cutting their hair, going on T, getting top surgery, looking androgynous and I just feel helpless to do any of it. The dysphoria is kicking me in the face and I wish I could change something to feel better in this upcoming 2019...\nThank you if you read all my ranting, have a good evening/day', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'It‚Äôs getting harder and idk what to do', 'created': 1545880646.0}"

2018-12-27 01:50:08,a9up8v,5,1,"Hi, long time lerker. On mobile. TL;DR at the bottom.
I wanted to share my little victory today because i can really use some nb support right now.

I've identified as nonbinary for a year now, and recently my dysphoria has been off-the-charts bad. Like, to a point where even leaving my room is difficult (bc strangers and even my own parents dont see or accept me as nb). I dont have any nb people around me, so I've been trying to handle the dysphoria on my own, which has been a huge struggle (there's only so much self-care you can do, bc strangers will still misgender me anyways).

My dysphoria triggers anxiety/depression as well, which doesnt help.

But today, i finally got the courage to make phone calls to get help. I got my health care straigtened out so I'll still be with the same primary care doctor (Im over 26, so i had to find my own health care and my job doesnt provide me one bc thats the nature of the job), and they gave me a phone number i can call to get hooked up with a psychologist/therapist/etc.

(Since im a highly sensitive person and an introvert, this hour of calling several places is all i can muster up the energy to do today, but) i took the first step into getting help with my dysphoria/possible transition (HRT, etc).

I still don't know if/when i want to do HRT or surgery, but getting my foot in the door has relieved my stress a lot.

After saying that, though, I have some questions for nonbinarys who have started transitioning: what steps did you take to get on T and get breast removal surgery? I've been struggling to find info on how to get going with these, so if you could offer me insights, i would appreciate it! 

TL;DR my dysphoria has been super bad; i finally made some phone calls to get started on getting help with it. Questions: what did you have to do to get started on T and/or breast removal surgery?

2018-12-27 20:01:57,aa2mel,10,1,"Hi lovely people,

I thought I'd make my first proper post on this subreddit because gender concerns have been taking up so much of my headspace lately and I'd really like to get some of it off my chest. I'm an AFAB who came to the realisation about four years ago that I have never identified as a woman. I would describe myself as transmasculine nonbinary --- I feel an immense sense of freedom when I lean way more into the masculine side of things; when I first got my hair cut short, it was such a spectacular relief.

However, recently I've started questioning again, and constantly drilling myself on what I want to do in the future. For the most part, I'm reasonably okay with my body as it is now --- my chest is very small and not really noticeable thank goodness, and apparently I'm naturally androgynous and a lot of the time pass as a man. However, whenever I speak I feel like my voice gives me away, and makes me feel distanced from myself, like I'm spectating in my own life. Lately I've also been messing around with FaceApp and realised (despite the shame and embarrassment that has been so ingrained in me) that I would really like a beard. As it is, I naturally have the ability to grow a small bit of chin scruff (again, I've been trained to feel deeply ashamed of that) and I really like that. I seem to want to look very masculine but without being fully called a transgender man, for some reason --- and I'm afraid of that. 

I guess my question really is, where do I go from here? I've been toying in my head with the possibility of transitioning in the future, but I'm worried that transitioning would push me too far in the masculine direction. I'm also worried that it would remove any romantic prospects (my dad told me immediately upon coming out that no one would love me). I'm scared of being transgender because I know that I will probably have to deal with a ton of discrimination. But on the flip side, if I don't transition, I'm scared of my body becoming more feminine with age --- or missing the opportunity to be freely myself. Maybe testosterone and/or surgery, as terrifying as it could be to take that leap (I've never had surgery in my life), could make me feel happier. Life is short, and all; I don't want to get older and regret not doing something sooner. I would certainly like to broaden out my shoulders, deepen my voice a bit, and maybe get that bit of a beard.

I don't have any trans friends, so I'm unsure of who to talk to about how I feel. It's hard not to feel a dreadful sense of imposter syndrome whenever I realise that I am actually part of the LGBT community. I'm scared too, of all that I could have to deal with if I'm more open. Right now, I'm toeing the line where I'm pretty androgynous but can still safely pretend to be cisgender if I don't feel safe --- I'm only out to my immediate family, a handful of friends and a therapist who I don't get to see often. If I was able to try testosterone out, that social safety stealth blanket might be taken away. Would it be worth it?

My parents are fairly supportive, though I don't think they know much about trans &amp; non-binary identities. My brother might be more challenging, and I'm really unsure about my SIL. I'm planning on sending them all roughly the same letter. Here it is: 

Dear (Family),

I want to share some news with you, and I‚Äôve been thinking for a while about the best way to tell you, so I‚Äôve written this letter. I‚Äôm non-binary. You probably don‚Äôt know what that means, so I‚Äôll explain. Non-binary describes people that do not fit neatly into the gender binary of man or woman. I am not a woman, I am non-binary. The reason I‚Äôm sharing this with you is because up until now, it has felt like something I need to hide. But I am not ashamed of who I am, and I want to be open with you. I‚Äôm sure that you have a lot of questions running through your head, so I‚Äôll try to answer some of them.

Non-binary falls under the transgender umbrella, as transgender describes people who do not identify as the gender they were assigned at birth. Gender identity is separate from biological sex, and many trans people will go through a social transition and/or a medical transition. I‚Äôm not planning on going through hormone replacement therapy or surgery, as I‚Äôm hopeful that exercise and clothing will be enough to address my discomfort with certain aspects of my body. However, I am going through a social transition, which means I am telling others about my gender identity and I am telling others how I want to be addressed. I am not comfortable with she/her pronouns or being called a woman/lady/girl. When someone uses these to describe me, it feels like they‚Äôre talking about someone else. I ask that you use they/them pronouns for me. For example, ‚Äú(Name) left their mail here. I‚Äôll send them a text so they can pick it up‚Äù or ‚ÄúHave you seen (Name)?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, they‚Äôre in the kitchen peeling potatoes,‚Äù. This is really important to me. The most common objection that people have about they/them pronouns is that it refers to a group of people, not one person. But the singular they has been in use for many years to describe someone of unknown gender. For example, ‚Äúsomeone left their keys here,‚Äù or ‚Äúthey hung up without saying anything‚Äù. 

I‚Äôve come out at work, and asked everyone to use they/them pronouns for me. People have been accepting, and they‚Äôre doing well for the most part. But to help you understand why this is important for me, I‚Äôll explain how it feels when someone doesn‚Äôt use the right pronouns. Last week, a few people came to tour the shelter. My boss introduced me to our visitors and used she/her pronouns. I immediately felt my anxiety rise, my heart was pounding, and I felt awful - like who I am is shameful or inconvenient. It affected me for the rest of the day, and I lost sleep because I was trying to think of how to address it with her. When someone uses she/her to refer to me, it doesn‚Äôt feel right. It‚Äôs similar to when someone uses the wrong pronouns for you, it‚Äôs glaringly obvious and maybe a little uncomfortable. But when someone gets them right, it feels amazing. Recently, I overheard a co-worker‚Äôs phone conversation where he used they/them when speaking about me and I couldn‚Äôt stop grinning. I felt so happy and light for the rest of the day. In addition to they/them pronouns, I would like you to use gender-neutral terms like child or our youngest instead of daughter and sibling instead of sister. I expect an adjustment period but I would really appreciate your effort. These changes go a long way toward making me feel seen, accepted, and comfortable in my body and surroundings. 

This discovery and this process has been difficult for me. It‚Äôs tough to come to the realization that something‚Äôs not right and the only way you can move through life is by making yourself vulnerable and telling other people. Jason has been really supportive, and he has helped me more than he‚Äôll ever know. I‚Äôve also been seeing a therapist for a while to process these feelings. Even though it hasn‚Äôt been easy, it feels great to be true to myself and honor myself by being honest with others. But this is all still very fresh for me, and I‚Äôm feeling pretty raw so there may be some questions I‚Äôm not able to answer. I‚Äôve linked some resources at the bottom, and I would really like you to read through them before we talk. Please reach out to me when you feel ready. 
 
Love always,

I ask that you use they/them pronouns for me. For example, ‚Äú(Name) left their mail here. I‚Äôll send them a text so they can pick it up‚Äù or ‚ÄúHave you seen (Name)?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, they‚Äôre in the kitchen peeling potatoes,‚Äù. This is really important to me. The most common objection that people have about they/them pronouns is that it refers to a group of people, not one person. But the singular they has been in use for many years to describe someone of unknown gender. For example, ‚Äúsomeone left their keys here,‚Äù or ‚Äúthey hung up without saying anything‚Äù. \n\nI‚Äôve come out at work, and asked everyone to use they/them pronouns for me. People have been accepting, and they‚Äôre doing well for the most part. But to help you understand why this is important for me, I‚Äôll explain how it feels when someone doesn‚Äôt use the right pronouns. Last week, a few people came to tour the shelter. My boss introduced me to our visitors and used she/her pronouns. I immediately felt my anxiety rise, my heart was pounding, and I felt awful - like who I am is shameful or inconvenient. It affected me for the rest of the day, and I lost sleep because I was trying to think of how to address it with her. When someone uses she/her to refer to me, it doesn‚Äôt feel right. It‚Äôs similar to when someone uses the wrong pronouns for you, it‚Äôs glaringly obvious and maybe a little uncomfortable. But when someone gets them right, it feels amazing. Recently, I overheard a co-worker‚Äôs phone conversation where he used they/them when speaking about me and I couldn‚Äôt stop grinning. I felt so happy and light for the rest of the day. In addition to they/them pronouns, I would like you to use gender-neutral terms like child or our youngest instead of daughter and sibling instead of sister. I expect an adjustment period but I would really appreciate your effort. These changes go a long way toward making me feel seen, accepted, and comfortable in my body and surroundings. \n\nThis discovery and this process has been difficult for me. It‚Äôs tough to come to the realization that something‚Äôs not right and the only way you can move through life is by making yourself vulnerable and telling other people. Jason has been really supportive, and he has helped me more than he‚Äôll ever know. I‚Äôve also been seeing a therapist for a while to process these feelings. Even though it hasn‚Äôt been easy, it feels great to be true to myself and honor myself by being honest with others. But this is all still very fresh for me, and I‚Äôm feeling pretty raw so there may be some questions I‚Äôm not able to answer. I‚Äôve linked some resources at the bottom, and I would really like you to read through them before we talk. Please reach out to me when you feel ready. \n \nLove always,\n(Name)\n"", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Can I get some feedback on my coming out letter?', 'created': 1546049584.0}"

2018-12-29 20:27:40,aaonpo,25,1,"**TL;DR:** I want to have a conversation about being an agender/gq/nb afab person who embraces both masc *AND* femme appearances, rather than aspiring to be the masc-androgyny that seems to be the 'ideal' for gq folx, and how hard it can be to feel valid. (AMAB people who like to embrace their masc side are welcome too! I'm sure there's lots of overlap.)

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, hello friends, I've been trying to write this post for like an hour because I can't find the right way to phrase this so we're just gonna go and see what happens.

I spend a lot of my time validating my identity because  I'm an agender, afab person who is comfortable in (and actually like) my afab body; I don't want surgery, I don't want hormones. The only things I'd change about my body is my junk &amp; my voice: I'd love some bottom-growth &amp; a lower/huskier voice. However, I don't want everything else that typically comes with those changes; to my knowledge there's no effective way to achieve bottom growth without hormones, and hormones come with other things like facial hair, male pattern baldness, bone growth, etc.

Overall I'm comfortable being in both masc &amp; femme clothes/appearances (either way I get read as 'she' so whatever, ugh) but I always feel like a """"""better"""""" agender person when I dress masc, than when I dress femme. *WHY?* It doesn't even make sense--being agender is literally *not having* a gender! It's the community that makes me feel like that though. Whenever I tell someone that I'm agender, there always seems to be this assumption that I'm going to get top surgery, or that--IDK, just lots of subtle things that make me feel like I'm less valid for not wanting to modify my body.

One of my partners is in a similar boat (though they like to dress primarily butch/masc), mostly being fine with their body but wanting to change little things that either require many more changes elsewhere, or that are actually impossible, so what do you do when that happens? You just learn to be comfortable with--or god forbid actually like--your body. It takes a lot of work though, especially in a society/community that still seems to prefer/privilege masc-aligned  appearances. 

&amp;#x200B;

The only things I\'d change about my body is my junk &amp; my voice: I\'d love some bottom-growth &amp; a lower/huskier voice. However, I don\'t want everything else that typically comes with those changes; to my knowledge there\'s no effective way to achieve bottom growth without hormones, and hormones come with other things like facial hair, male pattern baldness, bone growth, etc.\n\nOverall I\'m comfortable being in both masc &amp; femme clothes/appearances (either way I get read as \'she\' so whatever, ugh) but I always feel like a """"""better"""""" agender person when I dress masc, than when I dress femme. *WHY?* It doesn\'t even make sense--being agender is literally *not having* a gender! It\'s the community that makes me feel like that though. Whenever I tell someone that I\'m agender, there always seems to be this assumption that I\'m going to get top surgery, or that--IDK, just lots of subtle things that make me feel like I\'m less valid for not wanting to modify my body.\n\nOne of my partners is in a similar boat (though they like to dress primarily butch/masc), mostly being fine with their body but wanting to change little things that either require many more changes elsewhere, or that are actually impossible, so what do you do when that happens? You just learn to be comfortable with--or god forbid actually like--your body. It takes a lot of work though, especially in a society/community that still seems to prefer/privilege masc-aligned  appearances. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***SO!*** I would love to have a conversation about why (in my experience) so many/most gq afab people gravitate toward a trans-masc presentation--or like, specifically, I guess about the \'androgynous ideal\' that is basically just soft/effeminate masculinity.

2018-12-30 04:32:30,aasqmy,6,1,"tldr at bottom!

Hi so as of this month I am just starting to identify as nonbinary and get more comfortable after questioning my gender identity especially these past six months and off and on over the past many years!

 I work as a private companion to a woman in her 90s who lives in a care facility and I'm regularly communicating with the other elderly residents and staff. I identified mostly as a butch lesbian up until now and had some issues with some residents talking about me behind my back and asking a lot questions as older people do. I've been called he, she, and it in a single conversation and have laughed at lots of jokes about myself. All the facility staff knew I was a girl and most of the residents knew I was too but they just thought I was really weird cause I looked like a 12 year old boy. Every time I told someone my name there was a lot of explaining to do....

 Fast forward to this week and my client has just moved to a new facility and I am super trans. I am experimenting with a new name while still using my nickname i've had since birth and was considering using it at work because I would be in a new place but I ended up not doing that because all of the other companions of my client are still working with her and they use my old name and i'm not ready to tackle this with all of them yet. 

With the staff at this new place I've been introducing myself and they automatically use she/her bc my name is feminine but with the residents I introduce myself and they usually mishear it/correct it to a masculine name and use he/him. Today I kept getting asked if I was a boy or girl by lots of them and I kept avoiding the question and let them assume that I was a young boy. I decided to introduce myself to a big group with the nickname I'm trying out because they already were assuming I was a boy and didn't want to complicate things. One of the younger facility staff who I had just introduced myself to (with my original nickname) heard what was going and came up and said ""Hey just so I don't get confused what are your pronouns?"" and I said that I use they/them and I felt really cool that someone asked me that outside an LGBT space. 

But yeah I ended up forcing myself to pass as a dude for 8 hours today and I thought it was fine because ""at least it's not a girl!"" but now I am realizing how emotionally exhausted I am after letting myself get misgendered multiple ways and making myself do that all day and i'm like ???? I don't really know what I want to do about this?? I don't know if I could come out as nonbinary at work because these are 70-100 year olds I am dealing with here and I don't even know where I would begin? I'm not even sure I would have the confidence and emotional energy to come out to the staff here and my coworkers because I know almost all of them would not know what nonbinary is and might even reject it&gt;&gt;??? (i'm not out to my family yet too) Is it even worth it to try?

Anyways I guess I am just looking for support here and thoughts on this whole situation? If I were to come out do is there any advice on doing this with very old people? I feel kind of overwhelmed thinking about this because I've kind of tangled myself up with two different names and three sets of pronouns these past few days.

hopefully this make sense!!

I've always thought of myself as just an androgynous girl, I wear whatever whenever with no thought for the gender of the clothing or how i present.

I really flip fop on my desire for top surgery. (I also flip flop on whether I'm a trans guy or AFAB nonbinary, but that's I'm sure partially due to obsessive tendencies I've got going on.) Lots of times I'm like ""omg I don't NEED these and they don't LOOK GOOD, they should just go now"" and other times I'll think ""meh. they're fine. why fix something that isn't broken."" (they're proportional to my body, as in I've stopped wearing bras and it doesn't hinder my daily activities, although we'll see how it goes in the summer when I gotta move from 100% hoodies 100% of the time to t-shirts forever). 

I used to love my breasts, and now i'm really ambiviliant about them. I completely understand that top surgery is a permanant choice and costs a lot of money and time and is not a decision to be taken lightly, but sometimes I'm really like ""meh"" about either option.
