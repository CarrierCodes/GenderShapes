2018-06-01 15:21:30,8nsou0,0,27,"Random thing I want to share.

It was the Catfish episode of Ari and Jamey that made me accept I was trans/NB.

I'd discovered/been reading about agender and other nonbinary identities. I initially stumbled across it because of the LGBT positive artists I followed on tumblr, from there I actively sought out information.

It was like I was split in 2, or maybe more like a Russian doll inside me. Part of me knew that I felt a personal connection to this. I even had the cringey/ignorant moment of maybe I'm intersex (sorry!) but remembered I'd done one of those online spit-DNA tests so knew I had XX chromosomes.

Then the aforementioned episode of Catfish. I saw it for a second time while a bunch of friends where over. One of them said something along the lines of trapping/tricking him and I *went off* I was *livid.*

Cue me storming off and everyone leaving. My spouse literally found me in the closet freaking out. This had clearly hit a personal note and he wanted to know why. He was very concerned and understanding. I freaked out and long story short told him it was because I was like her, but I'm an ""it"" and no one will be okay with that (internalized transphobia). I had not truly acknowledged it to myself before. I came out to him at the same time I came out to myself.

He was accepting but also at times struggled with it. He seems to have gotten past that though and I think it's been over a year since its been remotely an issue. He uses my proper pronouns and defends me. He went to support group with me. He for a time also considered they/them but ultimately is just gender divergent and went back to he/him. We are stronger for it and I hope one day I can be completely instead of partially out. Lately I've been exploring and accepting that I might need to actually transition more than I'd originally anticipated, baby-steps!

Thanks Ari for being brave enough to share your story on TV and to all the people online who pioneered getting this info out there. Visibility is so important! I didn't even know you could be anything other than a boy or girl! Learning this (and getting over my fear of being NB) has made me happier and more comfortable in my skin.

As time has passed, I've begun to realize how much I'm bothered by wrong pronouns (I prefer they/them), and how I really just want to be proud of who I am, and not hide it and feel ashamed of it. I thought maybe I could hear some coming out stories from all of you to help give me some inspiration/bravery. I have a trans brother and if I know anything, I know its going to be hard to come out to our family. I immediately assume they will all say I'm riding on his coat tails and wanting to be like him (because were twins and I just want to feel closer to him, I have gotten this reaction before from one person Ive come out to) Or that I'm just making shit up. Basically all the usual fears one might face in the coming out process. I've got a wonderful support network in my partner and a few great friends, but I just havent mustered up the courage yet. What advice do you all have? Happy pride and happy lives to you all. &lt;3"", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Been thinking about coming out.

2018-06-04 23:56:14,8om7g0,17,79,"I recently started coming out as nonbinary, and telling people to use my new name. In our small community, I've found a lot of love, and some things I've noticed. Everyone expresses differently.

The well\-known image that people seem to have of a nonbinary person is an afab teenager with buzzed hair and a jean jacket. This is, for about a year or two, what I thought I needed to be. I spent a lot of time and effort trying to push a look that was androgynous and punk without being actually *out*.

The first time I saw an amab nonbinary person, I thought they looked like sunshine through my computer screen. Their hair was shoulder\-length and their eyeliner was fantastic. I'm an afab person, but I saw this enby and realized suddenly, there's no right way to *be* nonbinary. While this is glorious and made me feel immediately more welcome, I realized that I couldn't do the regular nonbinary look. I had the short hair with shaved sides and the jean jackets for a year, but when I grew my hair out to my shoulders, I found that it was the look that* reall*y validated me. I call it my skater boy haircut.

We have gender roles, even as nonbinary people. Boys are expected to have short hair and sports, girls are expected to have long hair and makeup, and nonbinary people are expected to serve up our most extra and most androgynous looks. Thing is, we don't have a gender to pass as. We're a concept that isn't accepted or really recognized a lot of the time. This realization changed my life. I don't have to pass as anything. I can wear a dress or a suit and it doesn't matter what my body looks like, it doesn't define me. Your body doesn't define you, and you can wear anything that makes you happy.

Clothes and looks have no gender, and they don't define us. Wear makeup if you want, wear bowties if you want, wear anything you want. You are who you are, and nobody and nothing can change that.

I'm a nonbinary person, I get dysphoria, so I want a binder, but I also like the feeling of skirts on my legs, so I'll wear my binder and a skirt. Maybe the next day I'll need a break from binding, and I'll wear a bra and a t\-shirt and jeans, and just go on my way, and I'm still me, I'm still an enby. I wore a dress and heels to Prom, and it was still a nonbinary\-ass person in all the photos. Clothes and gender have become separate to me.

This isn't to say that you shouldn't be trying to look androgynous or have the ""nonbinary look"", if that's what makes you feel good, get it and hold onto that.

My AFAB partner has recently began identifying as non-binary it was something I (also AFAB) wasn't really aware of before. Since they started doing research and watching non-binary and trans videos on YouTube I'm now starting to wonder if I'm not cis. 

I have never been very gender-conforming and was pressured to be feminine growing up. Recently I've begun presenting more masculine in my look  (men's clothes, short hair) and feeling more confident in myself. Occasionally I get gendered as male and it totally makes my day.

The thing that worries me is my partner has a lot of gender dysphoria compared to the minimal amount that I feel. I don't want to feel like I'm piggy-backing on their experience of self-discovery and figuring everything out.

I'm in a relationship that I've invested a lot in and now believe is becoming fully healthy (and very valuable even if not 100% balanced yet), but it started with two months of my partner lying to me about believing NB exists as a gender instead of admitting she was transmedicalist and was seeing me as a woman.  I asked her Day 1 if she was bisexual because I can only date someone who will like me as bigender.  I said I was going on T soon on the second date.  She ignored all that because it only mattered what she wanted from me and saw me as.  No one should be doubted about their stated gender, and it's ridiculous because I have been out basically my whole life, with family who finds it obvious, and a documented history of my years of being dually male and female.  She mentally edited me into a woman, minimally pretended to care/believe when I explained it to her over and over and over, shamed and guilted me if I said I was uncomfortable/having trouble trusting her/unable to be myself around her, shamed me anytime I acted male, said something maximally dysphoric (you're all curves, no edges, calling me a woman when I kept telling her not to, calling me her girlfriend when I said I wasn't).  She reinforced every female quality and behavior and pointedly ignored anything male, like when you're training an animal.  It was painfully slow to change, like when it was clear I'd leave she tried to say ""handsome"" but said it so inauthentically and jokingly it was worse.  She kept touching my breasts when I asked her not to, said I could fight her off if I'd wanted.  She kept ignoring my stated discomfort with PiV sex, pressured/manipulated me into what I know can tell was sexual behaviors that made me more attractively female in her eyes, no contraception (she's AMAB), made fun of me for being worried about a condom breaking and being distressed by taking Plan B.  I kept making excuses for her (because I'm dysfunctional about deserving mistreatment after narcissistic abuse/codependency from childhood).  Then she tried to persuade me not to start T because she'd worry I wouldn't look as cute, so I knew we had to stop doing this.  I made boundaries and set ultimatums and she came to realize how horrible she had been, fell apart. Over many months she slowly became accountable and improved and started affirming me. 

Now she's been very authentically affirming for months (claiming it was because she got over internalized homophobia that made her resist peace with her androphilic side of bisexuality), has said she knows she was abusive and wants to change, we mostly have sex w me topping now, and she does really seem to see me as bigender/masc of center and is authentically attracted to me for that.

I was born with feminine genitalia, but I am not sure what I am because I feel like nothing. I am okay with she/her/hers pronouns because that is how society sees me. Gender neutral pronouns are also acceptable, but I do not tell people those are my preferred pronouns. Overall, I feel like I am no gender, but I let people call me whatever pronoun they want.

In addition, I am uncomfortable with people saying ""yea girl"" and other feminine gendered terms to me. I just feel like a person, I suppose. Im just me.

I am fine with my genitalia and am neutral towards it. I think I am asexual and don't care about reproductive organs, so that might play a role in that outlook. However, I do not feel right with the rest of my body. I am not overweight, but I am curvy in traditionally feminine places.  I have largish breasts and a butt that I wish would disappear.

2018-06-11 13:51:50,8q9ol3,7,44,"Its kind of old news probably, but I just stumbled across the [The Report of the
2015 U.S. Transgender Survey](https://transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/usts/USTS-Full-Report-Dec17.pdf), and I thought some of the statistics where very interesting and unexpected. Sorry if this has been discussed before.

Chapter 4 (page 47-67) contains the results of one of the largest transgender surveys conducted at the time in the US (27k+ respondents). The survey is very thorough. For the most part the respondents where split into 4 groups: trans woman, trans men, non-binary people and cross dressers. Here are some of the statistics:

&gt;Gender identity: 35% Non-binary, 33% Transwoman, 29% Transmen, 3% Crossdressers

&gt;Pronouns respondents ask people to use: 37% he/his, 37% she/her, 29% they/their, 20% do not ask people to use specific pronouns, 4% no pronouns (only name), 4% other pronouns than the ones listed, 2% ze/hir.

&gt;Sexual orientation non-binary people: 34% queer, 21% pansexual, 17% asexual, 10% bisexual, 8% homosexual, 8% sexual orentation not listed, 2% heterosexual.

&gt;Gender that people who do not know they are non-binary usually assume they are: 58% Non-trans woman, 19% Assumptions vary, 17% Non-trans man, 2% Trans man, 2% Others cannot tell their genders, 1% Trans woman, 1% Non-binary.

&gt;53% Sometimes tell others they are non-binary, 44% usually let others assume they are man or woman, 3% always tell others they are non-binary.

&gt;Main reasons for not telling people they are non-binary: 86% most people do not understand so they don't try to explain it, 82% it is easier not to say anything, 63% most people dismiss it as not being a real identity or a ""phase"", 43% they might face violence, 35% they are not ready to tell people they identify as non-binary, 35% the might lose their job or not able to get a job, 24% they might not get the medical care they need.

I was very surprised at how many people identified as non-binary, seeing how little representation there is here on Reddit (both r/ftm and r/mtf are over 3 times the size, and they also seem to be the majority on subs like /asktransgender). 

In a way I shouldn't really be surprised that 58% of non-binary people are seen as a woman vs 17% men, since its socially acceptable for woman to dress as man but not for man to dress as woman, so when most people see a trace of femininity, they'll automatically think woman. But I was really surprised only 5% thought they where trans and/or non-binary. Personally, this is also the reason I don't like to go outside looking more 'feminine' because I don't like how different people treat me when they think I'm a woman.

The amount of non-binary people that never disclose that they are non-binary and the reasons why weren't very surprising to me, seeing how socially unacceptable it still is, but still made me kind of sad.

2018-06-12 17:54:55,8ql2dz,3,12,"Hi all,

After going through this process, I wanted to share my experience and what I learned after getting my top surgery approved through my insurance.

Step 1:
Call your insurance company to see if you have coverage for gender-related procedures, if so - ask to see if you have out-of-network benefits.  If you do, this is great.  This means you have more options when it comes to looking for a therapist (you'll most likely need a letter from them in support of your surgery) as well as locating a surgeon (Dr. Garramone will bill insurance for patients who have out-of-network benefits).  Make sure you understand the fine print of the out-of-network benefits.
Step 1A: If your insurance does not cover gender-related surgeries, you can appeal this!  There are some great resources out on the internet to help you do this, use Google!  

Step 2: Once you know that your insurance will cover such procedures (as they should!) the next thing you want to do is to ask about your deductible and how much it is.  A deductible is something that you need to pay first BEFORE insurance will pay anything.  For example, sometimes it's $500, meaning you need to pay out of pocket $500 before insurance kicks in.  Sometimes people have really high deductibles and in my case it's $2,000.  I'm lucky enough that my employer will cover 90% of that deductible only requiring me to pay $200.  So things like that could happen and you'll want to find out either from parents (if you're using their insurance or your own employer on how that works).  If you're using a government funded plan, you'll want to clarify that information when speaking with the benefits representative. 

Step 3: Find the procedure policy that indicates what documentation you need to get this surgery covered.  Google top surgery and then the name of your insurance.  This should pull up the policy which will tell you how many letters you need, sometimes it's 2, usually it's just 1.  What the letter should say, for example my letter needed to state how long I was living as my preferred gender and needed specific examples of how my gender dysphoria impacts my daily functions.  You can print out this procedure policy and give it your therapist or doctor, whoever is writing your letter.  This will ensure they include this information in your letter. 

Insurance has 30 days to make a decision on whether or not they will approve a surgery or not, however it typically takes them 5-7 business days.  You'll be notified via snail mail of the approval or denial and from there, you'll either be able to schedule your surgery or file an appeal. There are also great resources out there for a constructing an appeal for an insurance denial.

It still doesn't feel real and I was happy that I was able to navigate this crazy system.  I worked as an office manager in a Physical Therapy office for 3 years, so I became very familiar with CPT codes, insurance and benefits.  If you have any questions or want any help, please message me! I want others to know it's possible and that you have my support and help if needed.

I pass 100%. I have facial hair and a deep voice - which I want. I use he/him pronouns - which I don't really like, but tolerate. It's my dream to look as male as possible, but still have the world know that I'm not a guy. But I can't seem to take the next step and make this dream a reality.

I feel like, like I've spent all this time trying to be seen as a valid person, to not have my
(perceived) identity questioned, and if I come out as NB/use different pronouns, that'll all be taken away and I'll have to start over. To be completely honest with you all, I don't think I can handle it. Getting to the point of where I was seen as male was already a taxing and dysphoric process - I don't know if I can deal with another round.

But, I guess I'm still dysphoric over not embracing my NB-identity? I've been using they /them (just in my head for now), and I don't feel too bad hearing it. I used to hate the idea of using neutral pronouns for myself, but I think that might've just been the fear too.

2018-06-14 19:46:47,8r4rsb,1,16,"**Hi everyone! Sorry in advance for the long post...i'll try to sum it up with a tl;dr at the end but no promises :)**

I wanted to share what I hope will be a confidence booster for anyone (like myself) who often struggles with not only self\-acceptance but anxiety over shopping in the ladies department dressed as a guy/in guy mode/anything that doesn't scream feminine.

Over the past month or so I've kind of forced myself to take some big steps in this journey of self\-exploration and self\-acceptance. It all kind of started back in early May when I took a big step of faith and made a bridal appointment at David's Bridal ([read about it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/8hoqw0/davids_bridal_experience/)). That alone was a huge confidence booster and if you read my linked post, you'll understand why. Since then I've been so much more comfortable in walking into women's stores or the women's department and browsing and trying on clothes, and even being less ""secretive"" that I'm shopping for myself. Most people I've run into don't seem to give me a second glance or even notice there's a guy browsing the racks.

I am still figuring out my identity/expression, but I'm obviously non\-binary, somewhere between genderfluid, genderqueer or gender nonconforming. I know many people will tell me these terms are quite similar but I'm having trouble settling on one. That said, I'm really unable to present feminine in public at all at the moment. I am married, and my wife is not exactly comfortable with the idea of having a husband who is bending the societal gender boundaries, since this was a revelation I made after we were already married.

So, being an obvious guy (6'2"", beard, deep voice), I have always found it quite intimidating wander the ladies sections on my own. After my experience at David's Bridal, I've found it easier and easier to shop for myself by myself. Earlier this week I stopped into my local Lane Bryant shop (having heard they were very LGBT friendly), and quietly asked an employee if I could be fitted for a bra (I thought it would help fill out some of my more feminine tops even though I don't really \*need\* one), and she said ""oh absolutely!"" and took me back to the dressing room and measured me and asked if I was looking for something in particular. She brought me a few options and left me to try them on, checking on me once or twice and once I settled on one she cashed me out and we got talking and I told her I was going out to a party in public in a dress for the first time with friends and she seemed legitimately happy for me, and it was wonderful!! Having bought my bra, I could resist trying on a few dresses and tops while I was there so I picked out a few and after trying them on (to no avail, unfortunately, wrong sizes and I was running late to a work event at this point) she asked me ""how did those dresses work out?"" which was simply thrilling, openly talking to someone about the dresses I tried on and what I liked about them and what not.

Next day I decided to take this boost of confidence and stop in to Torrid (also very LGBT friendly) at my local mall. I browsed for a bit and one of the salesladies asked me if I needed anything so I asked her about some shoes I was looking for and she brought me out a couple pairs in different sizes and let me tell you \- in guy mode, in a ladies store, walking around in four\-inch block heels was an experience, let me tell you!! I had already picked out a few dresses to try on, but being in guy mode I didn't have a bra on, so I marched my confident self over to the bra racks, found one in my size, and confidently asked for a dressing room. Again, tried on several outfits and on the way out the very friendly saleslady asked how it went, not seeming to bat an eyelash that this 6'2"" guy just came out of a dressing room after trying on dresses and heels. It was SO AFFIRMING to not feel like a freak! 

I will be in San Diego in July for a few days and have more or less decided I'm going get myself all dolled up and head to one (or several) of the hopping gay bars in Hillcrest and have a few drinks and hopefully dance the night away!! PS if any of you lovlies happen to be in town mid\-July hit me up and if we can get together I'd love to meet some Reddit friends in SoCal!!

**tl:dr \- if you're worried or anxious about shopping in the women's department in guy mode, don't be! In my experience, (most) salespeople don't care who buys their clothes, and most other customers won't even give you a second glance. Granted some areas of the country are safer for this than others, and please don't risk your safety for a dress or pair of shoes, no matter how cute they are it's not worth it!**

Of names that I have come across, Timothy and Jason are my favorites. I can't really make myself go by Timothy, or any form of though, because my father's name is too similar. So Jason it is. Please, call me Jay.

I'm a college student, a psychology major. I transferred to my university after 2 long ass years at community college. The community I grew up in, and spent near 21 years in, is very much conservative and religious. I'd never met anyone who wasn't straight or not strictly born male or female. Sure, they were and are there, but I only saw them from a distance, and they never stuck around for long. After coming out, they never returned the following school year. They were all demonized by the church or ostracized by the school. Anyway, after I transferred I made some friends my first semester, all of them in the marching band. We never really hung out after season was over though. So I decided to rush a sorority that's associated with the school of music. 

That second semester is what I like to call both the self discovery semester and the beginning of my depression year. Long story short, my Big is gay af, and one of the most amazing humans I've ever met. In fact, a good 3/4 of the sorority is either not straight, not binary, or both. My little homophobic/transphobic ass went for a spin. I learned and I grew. I got really overwhelmed with social things and subsequently came out of some of my social anxiety. I also got overwhelmed with school work and learned the hard way that my major at the time, education, wasn't for me. Start the depression year. It was also the semester I said 'fuck it', and changed my major to psychology. I told no one. Literally walked into the psych building, filled out the papers, and took them straight to the dean's office. I told no one until a couple weeks later when I got a tentative acceptance to the major, dependent on me passing a summer class.

The beginning of my 2nd year at university, it was a time. I finally got to see the inner workings of my sorority, and all of the drama within it. I still love them anyway. I was bullied in marching band for having panic attacks during auditions. I finished the pre-reqs for my major. 

In August I discovered that I am asexual. I came out to my best friend in September. 

In November I discovered my attraction to women, in addition to men. So I came out as biromantic. 

Biromantic asexual.

It wasn't until this past semester, maybe around February, that I started feeling something different. I wasn't quite sure what it was. Due to the environment of where I grew up, I was never allowed to explore anything regarding myself. Basically a carbon copy of my parents. But after almost 2 years of living in a college town, I felt something. Something that I needed to explore. At first I thought I might be a trans male, but it didn't fit. 

The feeling comes and goes, and it varies in strength. Sometimes I feel a little feminine, though rarely. Sometimes I feel masculine, though not entirely. I often feel in between, kind of neither. I think I lean more toward masculine and that somewhere in between, rarely going to feminine. I don't know if it's really something I feel within me, or if it's a part of me rejecting how and where I was raised, forced into the feminine role and stereotype. 

There are some aspects of femininity I'm not sure I want to give up. But there are so many things I don't want to be a part of. I feel more comfortable in more masculine things. Today especially, being in a clothing store and longing to buy 'men's' jeans, boxers, and suits. I know that clothing doesn't have gender, but it's like a longing to look like them. To be lean and fit with boyish long hair. To be able to pull off a suit like that. Something my really af female body can't do, at least it the way I want it too.

I don't like my female body or my female name. I want a masculine or androgynous body with a masculine name. But I'm afraid. Sometimes I feel like I desperately want to transition to male. Sometimes I feel comfortable enough just downplaying my more feminine features. Sometimes I want to cut my long ass hair into that boyish cut, but I'm terrified I'll instantly regret it and have to live with it. I'm afraid to tell my friends, even though I know they'd be totally accepting. The only time I can admit it to myself is when I've had at least half a bottle of wine. So take this as my testament. 

I don't know wtf I am. I want to explore, but I'm terrafrickingfied. I've just gained acceptance into my friend group, and I don't want to jeopardize that. I have no idea who I am or who I want to be. Sometimes I want to be the person I've grown to be, even with the name and baggage that comes with what I was assigned. Sometimes I want to go for it, be Jason, be him, a part of me.

2018-06-16 11:47:29,8riv0l,17,15,"Hello, I’m posting on here for the first time (apart from my introduction post) as I’m interested in finding out if anyone is, or was, in a similar situation to me or might have any advice.

I’ve had gender dysphoria to varying degrees since I was a teenager, dealing with it in various ways such as choosing a male name, wearing  men’s clothes (or masculine clothes designed for women), having short hair, etc. I’ve had other mental problems such as OCD, anxiety and depression, which I’ve treated with anti-depressants (I’ve been off them for 10 years now though), CBT and psychoanalytical therapy. A couple of years ago I registered with a gender clinic and have now been prescribed a low dose of testosterone gel, after about a year of counselling with them. 

I don't have such intense body dysphoria as I used to, because I've come to terms with my anatomy as being just ""my body"" rather than a ""woman's body"". But I’d love to not be seen as a woman in society. I would prefer to be read as male more frequently by the general public. When I look at myself, I think I look fairly masculine, but it seems others don’t always read me that way and that gets me down sometimes. So that’s why I’m considering HRT. 

However I am also a bit worried about starting HRT. I think my tendency towards anxiety and obsessive thoughts are making the situation worse. I would really love to be able to pass as male, or at least look more ambiguous so people don’t instantly gender me as female, without having to risk the side effects of T. I don’t want all of them and I know you can’t tell which ones will happen unless you try it. So it feels like a bit of a gamble to me. The clinic haven't been that helpful in terms of guidance, pretty much just saying it's up to me! It's also hard to get frequent appointments with them due to severe short-staffing, so I don't feel very supported.

The main things I want are to have a more masculine face and body shape, and a lower voice. I can already grow a fair bit of facial hair naturally - not as much as a cis male but I have to shave every day to look clean-cut! But I don’t especially want a beard. I’d like to feel better in myself too, less anxious, and I've heard some people online and in real life say that T has done that for them. Although I guess that’s very subjective and personal.

Possible side effects I’m worried about: acne (I am prone to it even pre-T), head hair loss, possibly gaining fat, and maybe not liking genital changes that might happen. 

I have connected with a voice coach, who at our first meeting said I should be able to get into an androgynous or even male range without T! And I’m getting that on the NHS (I’m in the UK) so it’ll be free. So that’s one glimmer of hope for me at the moment. 

So as things stand now, I have the gel, I’ve tried a bit of it to see how it feels to apply it, and that’s about as far as I’ve got! For me, the question is not “am I transgender?” but rather, “what should I do about it?” I know some people socially transition before starting hormones, but I don’t really know where to start with that, beyond what I’ve already done in terms of my presentation. I’m quite a reserved person IRL, so to announce to people that they should see me as a man now feels difficult for me.

Greygender is a thing I very recently discovered and I'm trying to figure out if it fits me or not.

I've always been more of a ""tomboy"" girl growing up right? Like I've always been comfortable with she/her pronouns but I don't feel particularly feminine most of the time.

I don't really understand the concept of certain things or activities being tied to one gender or the other.

Some days I enjoy being more feminine, some days more masculine. I often feel uncomfortable in public dressing more masculine but I come from a small town and I'm afraid of the judgement.

Overall though, I just don't think I feel that my gender is something I have strong feelings towards but it's kind of hard to tell. Since I've never felt any other way maybe it's just the norm for everyone? 

I'm afraid to call myself greygender and end up changing my mind later or something. But I would love to have a word to use to describe myself other than ""tomboy"" because that's outdated and childish.

So I had a question about haircuts. I'm AFAB and I wish to look more androgynous but I also wish to save out for a bob or longer.

So far I felt that I looked the most androgynous was when I had a bit longer hair on top but an undercut. So I'm kinda worried I'll look too feminine with a bob. Any suggestions how to balance it? 

I tend to vary the way I dress from very masculine, neutral and very feminine. I just want a look where I truly feel like myself with the hair and face.

Thanks for reading! 💕

I have always  been more emotionally in touch than boys are expected to be, and in some ways stereotypically ""feminine"" but in a more tom-boyish way, if that makes sense?   I am also bi/pan and when I was younger assumed that this less-masculine leaning nature was connected to my sexuality (now totally aware that is not true).   Until recently I would just identify as ""male-by-default"" or, more jokingly ""gender apathetic.""   But of late I've been doing a lot more soul-searching on this topic and have begun to realize that I in fact belong in the androgynous/non-binary category.   Although I was already leaning towards this assumption, I decided to see if the internet, in all it's infinite and terrifying glory, had any sorts of ""tests"" available that could shed light on my gender identity in a relatively objective manner.   I found several, ranging from silly, buzz-feed style ""What Hogwarts House do you belong in?"" to what appear to be more serious psychological evaluations.  

So my question is:  At least for the more ""serious"" gender identity evaluations out there, do you think there is merit to such tests?   Has anyone else taken these and were you surprised/skeptical/offended by the results or questions?   I found some of the questions to be a bit odd, many seemed to suggest that one binary gender or the other was better at different intellectual subjects (i.e language arts versus math), and several just pertained to stereotypical gender-role interests (power tools and cars for men, clothing and sewing for women).   I was identified as androgynous or non-binary in all that I took, though many of the questions were very similar across tests, and I wonder if it wasn't just my pre-existing assumptions that influenced these results.  As someone trained in a ""hard"" science I tend to take psychology with a grain of salt.   I'm not saying it isn't a valid and useful line of research, just that every field of study has it's limitations and potential biases.   Anyway, thoughts, opinions on these tests?

Here's some more specifics:

🌼 I'm mostly looking for media about being non-binary, genderqueer, trans, and gender non-conforming. I'm also interested in media that helps explore issues related to non-binary experience, like women's liberation, queer liberation, patriarchy, etc. I'm definitely especially interested in media that centers non-binary experiences and perspective tho. 
🌼 I'm also looking for media that features non-binary characters w/o necessarily being about being non-binary, especially picture books for younger kids. More media that simply used they/them pronouns would be amaaaazzzzing.
🌼 I want both fiction and non-fiction!
🌼 K thru 5 is my age focus right now, but I'll probably expand that soon so send me resources for older kids too!

Although I am in a heterosexual marriage, my first sexual experience was with a woman, and I consider myself bisexual. My husband knows this and supports my desire for a relationship with a female at some point. 

So when we stop taking in terms of binary gender, things get more complicated. I have wished, all my life, that I was a “boy”. I can’t say I FEEL like a male, but I don’t really feel female either. I don’t like female clothing, I don’t participate in traditionally female activities, and my husband and I have very much reversed roles: I work and support him, he stays home. 

I love sports and business, I’m highly educated, I love male/androgynous clothing (although my body is very feminine, which makes this difficult), and I wish I didn’t “have to” wear makeup and jewelry and typical girly stuff. On any given day, I will choose the more “masculine” activity or thing over the “feminine” activity or thing. 

My husband has listened to COUNTLESS rants about “if I weren’t a woman, I could...” or “if only I was a dude...” or “just because I don’t have a penis?!” 

As a kid I was a “tomboy”. As a teenager, I was “one of the guys”. Now, I just feel misplaced. I want to smoke cigars and drink whiskey and talk about interesting important things, but the women I am exposed to expect me to want to drink rosé and talk about raising kids (or rather what is wrong with me for not wanting to raise kids). 

I feel that this is more than “being like a guy”-I don’t want to change my physicality, but I do want people to stop boxing me in and assuming I can’t/won’t/shouldn’t do things because of my genitalia. 

I’m not just trying to be the “edgy” or “cool” girl. I want to figure this out.

I'm an AFAB nb, and I just got my first binder! I was amazed at how free I felt as soon as i put it on—I've always had a very large chest, and it's interfered with my health, comfort, and body image for a long time.

Today was day 2 of wearing it a full day (about 8 hours both days), and I noticed both days difficulty managing my anger. I just couldn't really seem to calm down. I was reading through a list of stress management tips for a work training I have to do, and it said to focus on relaxing your muscles starting with the face and working your way down...and I realized I couldn't do that. I thought maybe the binder was causing a problem, but after taking it off, now my stupid tits are causing their normal neck and back tension. So it's not really any better.

The plan was to start transitioning (MTF) and once HRT had started doing it's thing, follow up socially.

I thought after I started HRT I would lean into the transition and the compulsion to present female would grow. I was prepared to have my follow up doctor's appointment and ask to crank up the hormones because I had decided that was my path after years of deliberation. I was going to do this.

Since starting though, it went away. I don't experience dysphoria. It's not important to me to transition to female socially anymore and frankly I would rather not deal with breast growth if I can avoid it. The other body changes I'm perfectly fine with.

I don't want to stop HRT, because for the first time I'm content. I'm not distracted from feelings of, I don't know how to describe it. I wouldn't say dysphoria, but I wasn't happy being a guy. It never really felt right.

I present fairly male with some effeminate touches, which didn't feel like enough before. I wanted to present completely female. Now I'm perfectly happy embracing an androgynous look. Less frustrated wearing masculine clothing, less scared to have feminine things that would make someone stop and look.

I don't know anyone that's non-binary and has identified as that for an extended period of time. I'm known people who have at one time thought they were but it was during a time they were still figuring themselves out and have since landed on being fully MTF.

Has anyone else had that reaction to HRT? Is there anyone that's non-binary that came to the conclusion through HRT? I've just spent so many years trying to find where I fit in the world, and after so much time settled on transgender, and to find I'm actually content without going all the way.

TL:DR; I thought I was transgender, but since starting HRT I think I may be non-binary but don't have much reference. Is this normal? What flag should I be hanging in my window?

I'm 23, genderqueer AFAB, been wanting to take T since January after years of being trans and considering HRT in the back of my mind. It was only this year that the constant misgendering as female despite started affecting my mental health and making me feel worse. I read the forums and health guides for a while, consulted a doctor about it, and got a prescription for T with informed consent. 

My mother flipped out. I'm an adult and should be able to make my own decisions and she knew I was genderqueer but the news I was trying to change my physical self was unbearable to her. I tried to have her talk to my doctor who told her T is relatively safe and they could monitor me for any negative health concerns of which I currently have none.

I'm living in Los Angeles this summer, but I was born and raised in Ohio. I attended the Saturday night of Los Angeles Pride, the night it reached capacity. Immediately I was gendered and assumed to be a lesbian by my lyft driver who was a lesbian. She assumed all the girls I was in the car with were also gay women. Two of the girls are bi and the other was an ally. None of them know I am non-binary, but all were very polite about not pushing me to answer any questions. I don't know them that well as we are just all here on the same summer program and hadn't met until a month ago. Our lyft driver then said some transphobic things and it made me and everyone else so uncomfortable. It was a weird car ride. 

When we arrived we met up with a man from our program. His face was painted rainbow and he was so excited for pride. After telling the story about our lyft driver to him, I explained I lied to her about being gay so it'd be less uncomfortable and easier to get through. He then asked ""well what are you then?"" Even after explaining I wasn't up to discussing it he pressed me 3 different times the rest of the night. I didn't understand why it was so important. 

I'm extremely femme presenting (AFAB ) and I wish I could appear more androgynous just for other people's sake of understanding but I am comfortable in my femininity. My physicality is extremely feminine and I love it, but I shaved my head recently and I'm just always assumed to be a shaved head lesbian girl. 

At pride I just felt so dominated by gay men. I don't want to take anything away from them, but I just was disappointed with the space. I didn't feel free there. I thought it may have been because I was there with acquaintances but I felt all the MCs only ever hyped up gay men. Gay women were talked about even less and I think I only heard something about gender nonconforming people once, and it seemed like an after thought. 

I guess I should've learned more about the festival itself before attending. I thought the booths would have more community driven stations, which were there but not in the way i thought. Everyone just wanted to get drunk it seemed. I don't drink much and hate being high in public spaces... it was a huge party I felt like I shouldn't have been invited to. I looked enough like I should be there but still felt people were making the wrong assumptions. 

I just feel like I've lost the momentum I was gaining with my confidence. There are so many people I've had conversations with about gender who don't get it yet. I'm scared to explain it to them.

2018-06-21 01:28:08,8snu14,3,50,"tl;dr I'm AMAB and today I wore a blouse and eyeliner to work for the first time.

I'm not 'out' as NB at work but I've been wearing my nails painted to work for several months now. I started painting them maybe a month after I started when I realized that no one knew anything about me and I had an opportunity to pretend I did it all the time. At first, I got a few glances, but no one really said anything (except for one amazing woman) until the office Christmas party, where everyone had been drinking. That's when all of the women were finding excuses to come tell me how much they loved my nails. It was a really great experience because I learned that just because no one is saying anything doesn't mean they disapprove. Since then I've started adding jewelry to my outfits and often get swept up in conversations with women where we talk about each others jewelry and maintenance etc.

A couple of weeks ago I started seeing a therapist to help me navigate the external transition I hope to make, and they mentioned something about the rules we make for ourselves that make it difficult to be ourselves. It's nothing I haven't heard, but in that moment it really struck a chord. I realized I don't want to live a life controlled by fear of rejection or retribution. I also realized that I'm doing exactly that. It's not actual retribution that's stopping me. It's fear. Just fear.

I went to grab a couple of drinks with that amazing woman I mentioned earlier and opened up to her about my identity and we connected and everything was great. This morning when I woke up, I was struggling to decide what top to wear. I grabbed a tight-ish shirt. I grabbed a pink shirt. I looked at some more of my  masculine cut t-shirts and felt frustrated. Suddenly, I realized I was struggling because I really wanted to wear something more feminine, and none of the masculine clothes I typically lean on to achieve that were working for me today. So I grabbed the blouse I bought a few weeks ago, ironed it, drew on some really simple cat eyes and left. No pre-meditation. Today was just the fucking day. I hope the day I walk out the door in a dress is right around the corner :)

Before I started seeing this  therapist, I was really concerned about how to go about telling my coworkers that I'm non-binary and how to tell them to use they/them pronouns when referring to me. I figured after I told them, I could start presenting myself however I see fit. I still intend to tell them, but I realized I don't need to tell them, or anyone about my identity to start expressing myself in a non-binary way.

I plan on calling her tomorrow to try to clear things up sooner rather than later, especially since my daughter is supposed to go spend two weeks with them at the beginning of July while my husband is recovering from surgery.

I spend hours researching for us every day with little results...feeling so lonely and isolated and hoping to find some people of similar experience. Please say hello if you're out there! Also, does anyone know of any good articles, interviews, essays, books, art, or music from nonbinary femme amab people, or similar? Thank you so much. &lt;3

I figured I'd share more details of my experience below if anyone is interested. Many times I've been soothed by just reading what someone else is going through.

\---

Most times I feel like I don't exist and my life isn't real.

I'm constantly trying to stay afloat in this liminal space and have created and adapted so many coping mechanisms to validate my experience. Every day is terrifying, it feels like there's no way in or out of my gender experience, so I float around trying to accept whatever arises. I am so happy for cis men and women who wake up and go about their day not giving the validity of their gender much thought. It is all-consuming for me at this point in my life. I know my happiest days are when I don't give what I do or who I am a second thought - I just be me. Usually that is only possible alone, inside, away from projections, scrutiny, and physical danger. 

I feel *so* damn femme, and I am not trying to / can't afford to pass as a woman, which mostly means when I am brave enough to express my gender in public I'm read as an effeminate gay guy or a straight guy ""very confident in his masculinity"" (the lengths patriarchy will go to keep people corralled in the man-zone -\_\_\_\_- ) ...

I crave permission to simply be myself. Well meaning people say ""just"" be yourself and suggest I forget labels. Wow. It sounds heavenly.

When I try that, I open myself up to critique, judgement, and emotional and physical violence. It has happened.  I have endured traumatic punishments for being myself. I have had enough conversations with ""devil's advocates"" to navigate hell as if it were my hometown. When I just be me, English falls short. My being is not compatible with cis or trans gender templates. I'm elsewhere, and it's scary, to me and to people who see me. We grapple with understanding. Do I deserve to be me? Deserve to be treated like a human? Or am I an ""it""? An other?  By being me, I am always explaining myself to myself and people who see me.

Being conscious of how I feel, how I act on those feelings, and how I'm perceived is so, so exhausting. I look like a man no matter what I do, and I don't pledge allegiance or feel in harmony with anything man-related, whatever that means. I'm an easy target for violence and exploitation because it appears I can't even ""play my role"". I am seen as weak, disposable, laughable...But what courage it takes to accept myself as nature made me despite all of this bullshit? How integral and important am I simply because I'm here - especially because I'm Trying? To live my life honestly, completely. And how serious this is when every day is a grand effort to convince myself I belong on Earth? I'm here, damn it!

Sōtō Zen Buddhism and my daily sitting practice has helped enormously. Sometimes my breath is my only refuge. When I sit, I feel included in all that is. Sometimes, I even feel deep peace, experiencing life beyond illusory gender and other markers of identity. Off the cushion, though, I have a hard time reconciling the development of my authentic, ordinary self that balances my spiritual, extraordinary no-self. I have only recently given myself permission to explore this.

Not passing as a man or a woman is so challenging. I could give a shit about passing insofar as it means safety to me. I am lucky and grateful to have a few friends who accept me as I am. Though, none of my friends are nonbinary, and I only hear about nonbinary femme amab people who have moved on to try to pass as a woman because this is all so heavy. I know of a few nonbinary afab people and my heart is rooting for all of them. I am so thankful for the nonbinary afab people who have recognized that there are not many nonbinary amab people speaking about their experiences, because they inspired me to share this. 

Perhaps I have been looking in the wrong places, which brings me here. 

Where are we? Please, I need to know. 

Thanks so much for reading.

\_\_\_\_\_

Dear Mom and Dad,

     I have been thinking a lot about how and when to tell you this. That’s why I decided to write you this letter. I don’t identify as male, but instead what is known as “nonbinary”. This means I don’t identify within the binary male/female definitions of gender, but something outside that. Along with that, I don’t feel comfortable using male pronouns for myself (he/him/his/himself), but prefer to use they/them/their/themself. I know this may seem confusing and unfamiliar, but I have some resources to help you understand. Please read through all of this letter and look at the articles and resources I’ve provided for you before talking to me about this.

     As I said, I identify as nonbinary. Although this might seem new or unusual, it is an established and valid gender identity. There is a long history, across many different cultures, of more than two distinct gender identities. The term nonbinary falls under the umbrella of Transgender, as I do not identify with the gender assigned to me at birth. Nonbinary is itself an umbrella term that encompasses many distinct gender identities, but all are outside or between the male/female binary. I understand that using they/them pronouns for me may be confusing at first, but it is commonly used for individual people and has a history of prominent usage dating through centuries of English language and literature. A frequent response to asking for use of they/them pronouns is that it is exclusively for groups of people and not individuals, but they/them is used regularly in everyday language for people whose gender identity is unknown. If someone lets you know you missed a phone call you might respond “What did they say?”, if you found a coat on your bed after a party you might ask “Did someone forget their jacket?” and so on. Along with these pronouns, I would appreciate if you would use gender neutral terms for me whenever applicable, such as “child” or “our oldest” instead of “son”, “parent” instead of “father”, “spouse” or “partner” instead of “husband”, “sibling” instead of “brother” and so on. If you’re unsure about what terms to use, you can ask me and I am happy to help.

    I know this all may sound scary and uncertain and that’s completely normal. I have my own fears and anxieties surrounding being open about my gender identity, but I ultimately feel it’s a positive and necessary step and would appreciate your utmost support in this. Adjusting to talking to and about me in gender neutral terms may take some time and effort, but it would make me much more comfortable if you could try to do so. I know this is a lot to take in and there can be many strong emotions involved, which is why I have included some resources to give you more information, as well as to direct you to support groups in your area for parents and family of gender variant people. All of which I think could be helpful to you. If after exploring these you still have questions for me or need more resources, I can help with that. I have already discussed all of this with \[spouse\] and she has told me she’s willing and available to discuss it with you as well. 

     I hope you understand that I still love you both and this doesn’t change our relationship. I still love \[spouse\], \[child 1\] and \[child 2\]. Our marriage and family are intact and she is giving me her full understanding and support. My gender identity does not change anything about who I am, apart from the pronouns and terms used to describe me and talk about me. In being honest and open about my gender identity, I’m not changing anything about who I am, but only trying to be myself more authentically in all my relationships. I will try to be as patient and calm as possible when answering any questions you may have, but there are some things that don’t need to be asked. What clothes I choose to wear or how I present my body is an expression of fashion and personal taste and not an indication of my gender. When exploring resources about nonbinary people and identities, you may find a lot of personal accounts of individuals pursuing many different types of gender expression and physical/medical transitions, all of which are valid, but may not apply to me personally. There are many people who identify as Transgender and nonbinary, not all of which fit in the “born in the wrong body” narrative. Personally, I don’t know at this time what transitioning will look like for me and it might change over time. While I would love and appreciate your support, I also ask that you please respect my privacy in this regard. You are free to disclose and discuss my gender identity with others, but I ask that you would do so with the same respect and sense of personal privacy you always have, as your child and an individual and not in terms of my body parts.

    Thank you for reading all of this. I’ve included links to several articles and resources for you. As I said before, please read through all of this letter and the provided resources, before talking to me about this. 

Love,

I thought I would post it, get some feedback and it might be useful to other people. I used a form letter I found on a nb tumblr as a starting reference. I'm 39, live across the country from my parents and have not lived with them for 20 years. I did however work with them and my brother for more than a decade and saw them regularly (if not daily), until about 18 months ago when my wife and I moved our family. My relationship with them is complicated and I'm not sure I'd even have one, if not for my wife and kids. I still feel like I need to come out to them before I really come out openly in public. I plan on mailing them a letter with a flash drive full of articles and local support group info for them. I don't discuss issues of name change, because I already have a gender neutral name and have no plans to change it.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nDear Mom and Dad,\n\n\xa0 \xa0 \xa0I have been thinking a lot about how and when to tell you this. That’s why I decided to write you this letter. I don’t identify as male, but instead what is known as “nonbinary”. This means I don’t identify within the binary male/female definitions of gender, but something outside that. Along with that, I don’t feel comfortable using male pronouns for myself (he/him/his/himself), but prefer to use they/them/their/themself. I know this may seem confusing and unfamiliar, but I have some resources to help you understand. Please read through all of this letter and look at the articles and resources I’ve provided for you before talking to me about this.\n\n\xa0 \xa0 \xa0As I said, I identify as nonbinary. Although this might seem new or unusual, it is an established and valid gender identity. There is a long history, across many different cultures, of more than two distinct gender identities. The term nonbinary falls under the umbrella of Transgender, as I do not identify with the gender assigned to me at birth. Nonbinary is itself an umbrella term that encompasses many distinct gender identities, but all are outside or between the male/female binary. I understand that using they/them pronouns for me may be confusing at first, but it is commonly used for individual people and has a history of prominent usage dating through centuries of English language and literature. A frequent response to asking for use of they/them pronouns is that it is exclusively for groups of people and not individuals, but they/them is used regularly in everyday language for people whose gender identity is unknown. If someone lets you know you missed a phone call you might respond “What did they say?”, if you found a coat on your bed after a party you might ask “Did someone forget their jacket?” and so on.

2018-06-30 23:20:47,8v5t9v,10,8,"I came out to my wife a month ago and there was a highly emotional adjustment period. I thought we were past it and have regularly had a lot of conversations about where I'm at, coming out to family, support meetings, explaining my gender identity to our kids.

Today she comes home crying and tells me (for not the first time) that she's afraid me coming out nb is ""a soft pedal for later coming out as a woman"". I've explained to her that the label I most identify with is agender and I don't have any desire for surgeries, I just want to be free to be myself and improve my self esteem and stop self policing myself to read as male (as a survival strategy/self loathing). She said she was particular triggered by my use of ""right now"" when talking about my plans or desires for transitioning. You know...I don't want any hormones or surgery...right now. My only real response was that I can't know how I will feel in a year or a decade, like anyone else. I've been clear about being agender though, not mtf. I explored that possibility for years and it never fit me, but as soon as I understood being nb, I knew immediately that was me. I just don't want to feel like I have to stick to what I feel right now, when I'm still figuring out how to be myself, let alone how to express it. It's hard to reassure someone you love that you won't ever change. We've both changed a lot in 15 years of marriage and always grown together, with lots of honesty and communication. Now I keep having thoughts like I should just force myself back in the closet, because no one I love will accept or understand me, but I can't go back to that crushing level of depression and numbness.

I had to just go in the bathroom and cry a couple times today.
