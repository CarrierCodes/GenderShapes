Is this a problem you feel passionate about? Does it even matter? 

Are there any online retailers which you feel have got this right?

Do you tend to buy your clothes from stores catering specifically to non-binary customers, or do you shop at general stores?

Is it problematic that 'men's clothes' and 'women's clothes' have (to my knowledge) different ways of describing the size?

I am an artist and I'm trying to fill the needs of my community as I see them. I'm already working on some zines about gender-neutral pronouns and why pronouns are important, and a very brief crash course on non-binary identities being A Thing™ 

But, I feel that this is still not....satisfactory. Many people have come up with gender books, comics on pronouns etc. Like the resources are out there, they're being made. I can help make them. But I'm still grasping, asking myself like, what can I do, what are needs *I* need filled? 

Obviously, only I can answer that last one, but I wanted to reach out to one of my communities and find out what other folks' might want/need in terms of resources, whether that's stories reflecting personal narratives, educational resources, etc. Thank you in advance

It masterfully brings up issues such as transphobia and homophobia, as well as anti-intersex thoughts and crimes, and sexism, all through fictional devices used as extended metaphors.

[MINOR SPOILERS] The book follows the two siblings Edie and Gnome through their lives in early 18th century England. There is only one problem: they share the same body. In the day, they are Edie - who is not aware of Gnome - and in the night, her body transforms into her brother Gnome’s male body, and he takes over the control. They must of course keep this a secret, for their own safety’s sake.

The book explores the relationship between gender and gender roles, as well as sexuality and “not fitting in”. It also has other sub-plots that it follows, such as the Suffragettes’ movement, and the gay and queer lives and rights movement of England.

All in all, it’s an amazing book, it is beautifully written, and it really makes you think of what it can mean to be queer.

I suppose I feared more backlash from professors and my fellow graduate students than I previously received, simply based on my race in an environment that does not support POCs. \n\nWhile I have learned to love myself and be my authentic self in a number of spaces, I am struggling with finding community (i.e. there are not a lot of Black, queer, enby academics). And while I know that community does not have to shared all of these identities, I have found very few people who shared even two of these identities in my activist and academic spaces. \n\nAre you all aware of any chat rooms or websites that may help me find my people?', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'AMAB/POC/Academic: Lacking Community', 'created': 1522916220.0}"

Of course I wanted HRT but that's not really realistic for us right now financially (or socially because of republican family members) so he was trying to figure out other ways to help. I ended up buying a new binder and some gay clothes (plaid jackets shirts with gay or trans slogans on them) which helped but a lot of my dysphoria comes from being in public. I hate the constant reminder that I'm a girl(ma'am/miss/her) and I told him it either feels like I have to be a girl or completely isolated to avoid being called that. So he suggested that if I didn't want to act like a girl in public I didnt have to. 

I initially did it because my anxiety is so so bad the only time I was super public I ended up vomiting even though nothing bad happened.

2018-04-06 18:45:11,8ac0wp,12,11,"I'm part of the non-binary community and LGBTQ+ community as a whole. I came close to do surgery and take hormones to have my body non-binary conforming, based on what is ""expected"" for people who are genderqueer. I had major body dysphoria at that point as genderfluid, being that my gender identity fluctuated through the gender spectrum. An LGBTQ+ psychologist pointed out that what is important is that you are okay with yourself and not pay too much attention to how others perceive you - if surgery helps, by all means, but think about what that entails. That helped me a lot and gave me a lot of strength and empowerment on my identity. I gave up the idea of changing myself to meet society's expectations, and it made me realise how messed up our society actually is.

But that is my experience. I realise that everyone has their journeys; everyone's lives are different, some more privileged than others. I often hear people say that they want to look a certain way and will go through lengths to reach it. As I write this I realise my post might be seen as something very ignorant, on the other hand, it might be seen as not. While I honestly believe that everyone should do whatever makes them feel happy, me being one of these people, I also wonder why is it not okay to simply be how we are? That it is okay to be a dude with a vagina or a woman with a penis. Is this not something society keeps telling us how we are supposed to be? That the representation of transmen and transwomen are often represented by a muscular man or very feminine woman? That non-binary people are people who obviously look like they haven't got a distinct gender? That kind of ideas messed me up big time for many years; and surely you might have experienced this too? Isn't our body dysphoria a product of society telling us how we are to be? Then the things we do to ourselves to become what society expects us to be? If we do not meet those standards, we are called snowflakes and marginalised.

A few years back, in a Pride, there was a lecture by a gay cis-man saying he was against marriage equality. He was against it because approving marriage equality would only welcome a handful of people into the inner circle of society and elude a country to be ""LGBTQ-friendly"". The rest of the LGBTQ+ community would still be marginalised, and thereby forgotten because ""we finally got marriage equality"". While trans-men who look like ""men"" and trans-women who look like ""women"" is now more accepted, being non-binary or trans without conforming with trans-gender-stereotypes is not. The LGBTQ+ community is a *very* diverse group and it is honestly impossible to put LGBTQ+ people in boxes as there are so many different identities. I honestly love being part of this community, and proudly wave the rainbow flag. I am concerned though that our community, especially the younger generation, are feeling forced/expected to be a certain way.

2018-04-08 02:32:31,8an4qz,14,48,"I was wrong. [30ish, AMAB, NB, they/them, just dont call me sir. This is about to get very very very long, but i just need to write it out]

[BACKGROUND]

I grew up in a very small town. Until around the time I got into middle school, the entire school district, outside of the high school, had a single combined year book consisting of maybe 60 pages in a paper back book. I had very very limited exposure, if at all, to anything outside of white, hetero relationships. Everyone went to church and all the adults in my life (my parents included) had got married to their high school sweethearts at 20 and stayed in town. 

I was very sheltered from sexual stuff, while also being exposed to its effects by my father's repeated philandering. I grew up knowing I was going to be the BEST dad ever. I was going to be there how my father wasn't. I was going to find a girlfriend, marry her, have kids, and settle back into my home town. I would be faithful and loyal. I would listen to my child.

By high school, the town had grown considerably, but it was still a very small town vibe. I was a very late bloomer. I don't think I fully went through puberty until 14. I had a LOT of short (~6 mo) relationships over the course of HS and would have puppy-dog-crushes on EVERY girl. There were several who I got *close* to sleeping with, but I really had no idea how any of that worked and we just never sealed the deal.

When I got to college, I thought I had failed by not marrying my HS sweetheart. When I found a girl that reciprocated my affections, she was the first girl I ever slept with. I ""put a ring on it"" after 8 months and married her after knowing her a year and a half. While we didn't wait until we were married (and had a lot of shame about it) I felt a lot of pride in having married my ""first."" It was the right thing to do.

During the course of that relationship, I had started working at a major coffee chain to provide us with heath care. The group of people I worked with were some of my first close exposure to anyone on the LGBT spectrum. There were two ""out"" gay kids in my HS, but that was definitely outside the norm and it was a ""don't ask don't tell"" subject, even though I friends with one of them. When I started at the coffee shop, a person said they had gone to Pride that weekend and I asked which zoo it was at, thinking it was a special lion exhibit. 

After around 2 years, it came out that my wife had been cheating on me with a TA in her class and we divorced. [I'm not really upset about that anymore. Neither of us had any business together and we were never a good fit. Just two small town kids trying to do the ""right thing.""]

Thus began my ""wild oats"" phase. I hooked up with my ""Rachael,"" a girl that had always lead me on since forever, I had my first one night stand, I had casual relations with a friend that had also just gone though a divorce, I drank til the bars shut down, and had a really really good time.

[THE BALLAD OF BILLY JOE AND BOBBIE SUE]

Which brings us to about 8 years ago. I met my SO, we'll call her Sue, though common friends at work. She would come and hang out with us at the bars, and we would always flirt and have a good time. She seemed so open to the world, at least compared to what I had known. She didn't seem to care what people thought of her. She was edgy and dark. She liked true crime and smoked weed and was the exact opposite of everything I had ever gone for in a person. One night we ended up together. 

It was magnetic. It was passionate. It was the most deep and surreal connection I had ever felt with someone. I had a hard time walking the next day. We just got each other on some other level and have been practically attached at the hip ever since.

Sue knew I had rushed into my last major relationship and didn't want to repeat the same mistakes, but within 2 years we were living together, had traveled the country, and were known to always be down for a good time (we threw some of the most epic rager parties anyone has ever seen).

We were very open with each other sexually and always trying new things. We weren't awkward around each other even the slightest bit. I had found my best friend and my favorite person on earth. We laughed, we cried, we would argue but always make up, and we just grew so tightly together. Neither of us had good parental relationships modeled to us, so we had to teach each other how to communicate our feelings. 

[SOMETHING'S DIFFERENT]

Three years in, a little over 5 years ago, I was back at the coffee shop, working very early hours (4am - 1pm) and would get several hours alone before my SO got home. As I said, we had both been very open with trying new things in our sex life, and one of those things was me wearing her panties. It was just a spicy little thing we did. Well one day on a whim I decided to try on one of her bras. I can't really describe the feeling, it wasn't that it felt ""right"" it just felt ""good."" It felt a little dirty, and a little weird, but it definitely moved the needle for me.

A couple weeks later was Valentines Day. I didn't for a second thing she would judge me and I wanted to explore these feelings together, and I didn't want to hide anything from her. Spoiler alert: it did NOT go well. As such, I think I have blocked out a lot of it. But I know I did not look good. I was always a big burly guy with a big beard. I had a thick carpet of chest hair. I think I had a on a black ""corset"" kind of thing and some fishnets, it was all stuff from her underwear drawer.

She freaked out. I had imagined she would see me, we would meet in the middle of the room, and just go to town on each other like we always did. I'm fairly certain she cried.

The next few months were tough. She made it very clear she was not into it, but the more she resisted the more I realized it meant something to me. It wasn't something I could just stop, but I did go to it being very private. Only when she wasn't home. I never said I wouldn't, but I tried to be respectful of her not wanting to see it.

After a big fight about it, maybe 6-8 months in, we had a sit down on our back porch. I told her that it didn't make me gay, I'm not attracted to men, I just like feeling pretty some times. ""I'm not trans, but I am queer. I just don't know what that means at this point."" I had discovered r/cd, and while I participated and loved it, I didn't think ""crossdresser"" fully described the way I felt. But given my background, I just didn't have the vocabulary to describe it. I had no frame of reference. But I knew I was in some way ""queer,"" or just beyond the ""norm."" I knew it meant something to me.

But I persisted and would periodically be en femme when she got home from work. I would get dolled up in whatever mishmash of clothes she had that would fit me, clean the house with a glass of wine, and nervously wait for her to get home.

I look at my posts/comments from that time and see me trying DESPERATELY to convince myself I was getting somewhere with her. That it was ""rough"" but we were making it through. 

And maybe we were?

One night, she took me to walmart at midnight and helped me get a pair of cheap 1"" heels and I was over the moon. I couldn't WAIT to get home from work the next day and walk around in them. She started to come around to helping me get some clothes at the mall, but very basic stuff. Any time she made a bag for the goodwill, I would go thru it and pull out anything that fit me and tuck it away. My bottom drawer of my dresser became the sanctuary. She took me to get a pedicure with her, she would paint my nails, I thought I was getting through to her.

I wouldn't try to change my voice and I hadn't been clean shaven in 5 years. But she said she didn't like that I would ""act different."" Crossing my legs at the knee, being the little spoon. She had wrapped her head around the fact that I was ""a dude in a dress,"" but she didn't want me to change myself. Every time the ""dude in a dress"" comment came up, I would add that it was more to it than that, but I wasn't sure how to fully communicate that.

[JESUS, THIS IS TOO LONG]

I feel very lucky that through all of this I never had a ""purge."" Over the next few years I told a select couple of friends about my crossdressing. I went to the mall en femme a few times. I got more confident shopping for myself. I moved all my feminine undergarments out of my main underwear drawer into their own. I bought shoes from Payless online and frilly dresses from charlotte russe. I found more excuses to shave. I shaved my chest a few times.

Sue and I had a few times where she would go stay at her parents, but when we got back together we would establish new boundaries and move forward. I told myself things were getting better, I told myself she was coming around. I realize now I guess I was just forcing it on her and she was putting up with it.

But it did get normalized. 

I broke off ties with my family over unrelated toxicity, and she was there for me. We would travel, we started introducing each other as husband and wife even though we werent married. We were a unit. Outside of this very specific facet of our relationship we were extremely happy.

But I still felt the draw to be more public with it. I never thought I would ""come out"" because I didn't know what I would ""come out"" as, but I would shave my legs or get them waxed and wear shorts around people without fear.

We bought a house together 2 years ago. When we found out we were pregnant we really had a long and frank discussion of our ""options."" I remember driving to her parents house before we had told them, daydreaming about something, and I thought to myself ""wait, you can't do that, you're about to be a father."" And I started crying.

We had the baby late in 2016. During the pregnancy, the urgency to crossdress went down, but not fully away. I was desperately trying to find a new job and I remember a casting call for a TLC show about ""alternative families during their first pregnancy"" and brought it up to Sue. ""Oh, is that still a thing? I thought you were over that."" 

After the baby came, I continued to crossdress, but it felt like more than that. I really wondered if I was ""trans-trans."" So much of the common experience on the trans subreddits resonated with me, but I never felt like a ""woman trapped in a mans body."" I didn't feel like there was this ""old me"" I had to get rid of. But I wanted to be more outwardly feminine.

Late last year I saw a post about a person that felt just like me. I reached out in DM to ask if there were anywhere I could find more people like us and they pointed me to /r/nonbinary and /r/genderqueer. FINALLY. I found my people.

I realized that I just wanted to be a person. I wanted to participate in the ""girly"" stuff I wasnt allowed to growing up. I wanted to wear makeup. I wanted to occasionally wear dresses or girly things. But I wanted to stay the same person.

That month I had a breakdown and drove over 300 miles in the middle of the night after another big fight. When I got back in the morning, I broke down ugly crying and told Sue that I was genderqueer. I had finally found the word to describe how I felt. She seemed receptive, but noted it scared her not knowing my ""timeline or endpoint."" I started to look for and secured a therapist to start working thru all these things. 

And the more I explored ""NBness"" the more I realized it just described me as a person. In politics, religion, everything, I had always maintained there was nuance, there was no strict black and white.

The floodgates opened. I came out to her mom, who would watch our daughter when we were at work. I came out to more and more of my friends. Around Christmas I started playing with wearing some mascara to work and eventually came out to my department. Everyone, and I mean everyone, was so supportive and understanding. 

I started presenting more femme at work, wearing full makeup on the two days a week I didn't go to the gym, and carrying a purse.

[THE BEGINNING OF THE END]

Christmas Eve. Hosting at our house for the first time. I'm out to her mom, but no one else in her family. For whatever fucking reason I decide to put on makeup. I think in my mind I was going to be the most gracious host that just HAPPENED to be wearing makeup. It was my opportunity to show that I'm the same person I've always been. And I blew it.

I don't know how it happened. I only remember pouring myself one drink, but I must have had a lot more because I have only VERY fuzzy memories of that night. I barely ever drink a full beer a night, much less get blackout drunk. I crashed out, woke up a few hours later, and started putting together my daughter's christmas presents. 

It wasnt until over a week later that Sue decided to fill me in on what happened. Apparently I had ruined a board game by being belligerent. I was being ""bitchy"" and generally just not a very fun person. I really really have no idea what the hell happened. Like I said, I got up after they left and put together gifts and such, I wasn't drunk then, and I got up very early the next morning and was not hung over.

But the cat was out of the bag. Sue had to try to explain to her 1970's NYC dad what the hell I was. No one would talk to me directly. We all got the flu and I was miserable both physically and mentally.

Her father met me for lunch when we had all recovered and I was delighted to find he had spent the week or two actually researching what 'non-binary' meant. We had a very frank and respectful conversation, although he did have one thing that struck me wrong: 

He said, ""if you start a relationship with a person and say, 'you should know I drink a beer every night and if you don't like that we shouldnt get together.' The other person agrees. Over the years, the first person starts drinking a six pack a night. And then a handle of vodka. The other person agreed to one beer, and they have the right to leave."" 

I understood what he was saying, but I was so delusional as to how much Sue really did support me. Even as I type out this ridiculously long post, I've skipped over many major fights on the subject. But I always saw the parts where she helped me and gave those more credence.

Sue was embarrassed about her mom seeing me go to work in makeup and more femme-presenting.

A month ago, she sat me down and said she had three things to say and that I needed to listen without giving input. She said: 

1) I am hurting people by doing what I'm doing

2) She wishes I was ""normal"" again

3) I don't think about how my daughter will be bullied because of me.

I tried to explain to her that I want to live a life of openness and honesty for my daughter. I never want to hide myself from her. And of course I've thought about her getting bullied because of me, but kids get bullied for a lot of reasons and I will work hard to give her the tools to deal with those situations when they arise.

Not satisfied with that, she went on to say that if I don't stop then I ""dont care about [my daughter].""

That hurt. A lot. I was very very upset. I was boiling but asked for space, went to the other side of the house, and took my frustrations out on a cardboard box in the recycling. She followed me, telling me ""youre a 30 year old man and should be able to handle it."" I walked past her repeating ""leave me alone leave me alone"" and she followed. Ironically, I ended up in my closet, huddled on the floor crying and screaming out for help. She mocked me. I started looking for my phone and when I found it I did the only thing I could think to do in my agitated state, I called the Crisis Hotline.

The woman on the other side of the phone talked me through breathing exercises. I told her what had happened. As I was on the phone, I sat against our bedroom door since it doesnt latch. After 20 minutes, Sam knocked and asked if she could come in. I said no, that I needed space, and she started trying to push her way in. She was on the phone with her mother and mocking how I was crying on the phone with someone. At one point she was pushing very hard against the door and said ""here's johnny."" 

I deduced she was going to take my daughter to her parents. I arranged to have the crisis call center call me back so I could call the police.

It was midnight on a Wednesday. It was raining. I was calmed down from my talk on the phone, so I was trying not to re-escalate the situation. I told her not to go, but I didn't try to grab her keys or stand behind the car or anything. The crisis center had told me she couldnt just take her so I felt calm in thinking the police would help. When I called them they laughed at me.

I was alone. 

And I've been alone ever since.

I have taken up WAY too much of everyones time here, so I'll spare everyone the details of the kind of toxicity I've been dealing with this month, but it hasnt been great.

I've had my daughter at our house overnight twice since then. I have taken her to the zoo and a museum, I've still gone to her doctors visits. But I mostly see her thru Facetime when Sue is okay with it.

I was informed Friday when I asked to see her this weekend that Sue had gotten a lawyer and wants to sell the house. I won't be allowed to see my daughter alone until after mediation is complete.

I'm so fucking lost and also never been more confident in who I am.

I have a really great friend from work that started after I was ""out"" and she's been such a huge support. I've reconnected with my old friends and met so many new friends.

I didn't get to see my daughter on easter weekend because I didnt give enough ""notice."" If I didnt have friends around itwould have been really tough. And I realized all the people I was hanging out with and having meaningful and thoughtful conversations with I had known less than a month.

I had to pay the mortgage and bills for the last month, and hadnt been reimbursed for bills for the month before she left. I am so unbelievably broke and busking for money to eat. 

I am up for a big promotion so I've had to go in on weekends and stay late.

I havent left my couch all day today. I don't even think I've turned on a light for more than a second.

I thought I was one of the lucky ones, but I realize thru my therapy that I've had my blinders on to all those times she wasn't supportive. And I really should have seen this coming.

I doubt very seriously anyone is going to read this, but thanks if you did.

TL;DR small town kid gets in touch with their femme side and it goes pretty okay until their entire life falls apart.

I grew up knowing I was going to be the BEST dad ever. I was going to be there how my father wasn\'t. I was going to find a girlfriend, marry her, have kids, and settle back into my home town. I would be faithful and loyal. I would listen to my child.\n\nBy high school, the town had grown considerably, but it was still a very small town vibe. I was a very late bloomer. I don\'t think I fully went through puberty until 14. I had a LOT of short (~6 mo) relationships over the course of HS and would have puppy-dog-crushes on EVERY girl. There were several who I got *close* to sleeping with, but I really had no idea how any of that worked and we just never sealed the deal.\n\nWhen I got to college, I thought I had failed by not marrying my HS sweetheart. When I found a girl that reciprocated my affections, she was the first girl I ever slept with. I ""put a ring on it"" after 8 months and married her after knowing her a year and a half. While we didn\'t wait until we were married (and had a lot of shame about it) I felt a lot of pride in having married my ""first."" It was the right thing to do.\n\nDuring the course of that relationship, I had started working at a major coffee chain to provide us with heath care. The group of people I worked with were some of my first close exposure to anyone on the LGBT spectrum. There were two ""out"" gay kids in my HS, but that was definitely outside the norm and it was a ""don\'t ask don\'t tell"" subject, even though I friends with one of them. When I started at the coffee shop, a person said they had gone to Pride that weekend and I asked which zoo it was at, thinking it was a special lion exhibit. \n\nAfter around 2 years, it came out that my wife had been cheating on me with a TA in her class and we divorced. [I\'m not really upset about that anymore. Neither of us had any business together and we were never a good fit. Just two small town kids trying to do the ""right thing.""]\n\nThus began my ""wild oats"" phase. I hooked up with my ""Rachael,"" a girl that had always lead me on since forever, I had my first one night stand, I had casual relations with a friend that had also just gone though a divorce, I drank til the bars shut down, and had a really really good time.\n\n[THE BALLAD OF BILLY JOE AND BOBBIE SUE]\n\nWhich brings us to about 8 years ago. I met my SO, we\'ll call her Sue, though common friends at work. She would come and hang out with us at the bars, and we would always flirt and have a good time. She seemed so open to the world, at least compared to what I had known. She didn\'t seem to care what people thought of her. She was edgy and dark. She liked true crime and smoked weed and was the exact opposite of everything I had ever gone for in a person. One night we ended up together. \n\nIt was magnetic. It was passionate. It was the most deep and surreal connection I had ever felt with someone. I had a hard time walking the next day. We just got each other on some other level and have been practically attached at the hip ever since.\n\nSue knew I had rushed into my last major relationship and didn\'t want to repeat the same mistakes, but within 2 years we were living together, had traveled the country, and were known to always be down for a good time (we threw some of the most epic rager parties anyone has ever seen).\n\nWe were very open with each other sexually and always trying new things. We weren\'t awkward around each other even the slightest bit. I had found my best friend and my favorite person on earth. We laughed, we cried, we would argue but always make up, and we just grew so tightly together. Neither of us had good parental relationships modeled to us, so we had to teach each other how to communicate our feelings. \n\n[SOMETHING\'S DIFFERENT]\n\nThree years in, a little over 5 years ago, I was back at the coffee shop, working very early hours (4am - 1pm) and would get several hours alone before my SO got home. As I said, we had both been very open with trying new things in our sex life, and one of those things was me wearing her panties. It was just a spicy little thing we did. Well one day on a whim I decided to try on one of her bras. I can\'t really describe the feeling, it wasn\'t that it felt ""right"" it just felt ""good."" It felt a little dirty, and a little weird, but it definitely moved the needle for me.\n\nA couple weeks later was Valentines Day. I didn\'t for a second thing she would judge me and I wanted to explore these feelings together, and I didn\'t want to hide anything from her. Spoiler alert: it did NOT go well. As such, I think I have blocked out a lot of it. But I know I did not look good. I was always a big burly guy with a big beard. I had a thick carpet of chest hair. I think I had a on a black ""corset"" kind of thing and some fishnets, it was all stuff from her underwear drawer.\n\nShe freaked out. I had imagined she would see me, we would meet in the middle of the room, and just go to town on each other like we always did. I\'m fairly certain she cried.\n\nThe next few months were tough. She made it very clear she was not into it, but the more she resisted the more I realized it meant something to me. It wasn\'t something I could just stop, but I did go to it being very private. Only when she wasn\'t home. I never said I wouldn\'t, but I tried to be respectful of her not wanting to see it.\n\nAfter a big fight about it, maybe 6-8 months in, we had a sit down on our back porch. I told her that it didn\'t make me gay, I\'m not attracted to men, I just like feeling pretty some times. ""I\'m not trans, but I am queer. I just don\'t know what that means at this point."" I had discovered r/cd, and while I participated and loved it, I didn\'t think ""crossdresser"" fully described the way I felt. But given my background, I just didn\'t have the vocabulary to describe it. I had no frame of reference. But I knew I was in some way ""queer,"" or just beyond the ""norm."" I knew it meant something to me.\n\nBut I persisted and would periodically be en femme when she got home from work. I would get dolled up in whatever mishmash of clothes she had that would fit me, clean the house with a glass of wine, and nervously wait for her to get home.\n\nI look at my posts/comments from that time and see me trying DESPERATELY to convince myself I was getting somewhere with her. That it was ""rough"" but we were making it through. \n\nAnd maybe we were?\n\nOne night, she took me to walmart at midnight and helped me get a pair of cheap 1"" heels and I was over the moon. I couldn\'t WAIT to get home from work the next day and walk around in them. She started to come around to helping me get some clothes at the mall, but very basic stuff. Any time she made a bag for the goodwill, I would go thru it and pull out anything that fit me and tuck it away. My bottom drawer of my dresser became the sanctuary. She took me to get a pedicure with her, she would paint my nails, I thought I was getting through to her.\n\nI wouldn\'t try to change my voice and I hadn\'t been clean shaven in 5 years. But she said she didn\'t like that I would ""act different."" Crossing my legs at the knee, being the little spoon. She had wrapped her head around the fact that I was ""a dude in a dress,"" but she didn\'t want me to change myself. Every time the ""dude in a dress"" comment came up, I would add that it was more to it than that, but I wasn\'t sure how to fully communicate that.\n\n[JESUS, THIS IS TOO LONG]\n\nI feel very lucky that through all of this I never had a ""purge."" Over the next few years I told a select couple of friends about my crossdressing. I went to the mall en femme a few times. I got more confident shopping for myself. I moved all my feminine undergarments out of my main underwear drawer into their own. I bought shoes from Payless online and frilly dresses from charlotte russe. I found more excuses to shave. I shaved my chest a few times.\n\nSue and I had a few times where she would go stay at her parents, but when we got back together we would establish new boundaries and move forward. I told myself things were getting better, I told myself she was coming around. I realize now I guess I was just forcing it on her and she was putting up with it.\n\nBut it did get normalized. \n\nI broke off ties with my family over unrelated toxicity, and she was there for me. We would travel, we started introducing each other as husband and wife even though we werent married. We were a unit. Outside of this very specific facet of our relationship we were extremely happy.\n\nBut I still felt the draw to be more public with it. I never thought I would ""come out"" because I didn\'t know what I would ""come out"" as, but I would shave my legs or get them waxed and wear shorts around people without fear.\n\nWe bought a house together 2 years ago. When we found out we were pregnant we really had a long and frank discussion of our ""options."" I remember driving to her parents house before we had told them, daydreaming about something, and I thought to myself ""wait, you can\'t do that, you\'re about to be a father."" And I started crying.\n\nWe had the baby late in 2016. During the pregnancy, the urgency to crossdress went down, but not fully away. I was desperately trying to find a new job and I remember a casting call for a TLC show about ""alternative families during their first pregnancy"" and brought it up to Sue. ""Oh, is that still a thing? I thought you were over that."" \n\nAfter the baby came, I continued to crossdress, but it felt like more than that. I really wondered if I was ""trans-trans."" So much of the common experience on the trans subreddits resonated with me, but I never felt like a ""woman trapped in a mans body."" I didn\'t feel like there was this ""old me"" I had to get rid of. But I wanted to be more outwardly feminine.\n\nLate last year I saw a post about a person that felt just like me. I reached out in DM to ask if there were anywhere I could find more people like us and they pointed me to /r/nonbinary and /r/genderqueer. FINALLY. I found my people.\n\nI realized that I just wanted to be a person. I wanted to participate in the ""girly"" stuff I wasnt allowed to growing up. I wanted to wear makeup. I wanted to occasionally wear dresses or girly things. But I wanted to stay the same person.\n\nThat month I had a breakdown and drove over 300 miles in the middle of the night after another big fight. When I got back in the morning, I broke down ugly crying and told Sue that I was genderqueer. I had finally found the word to describe how I felt. She seemed receptive, but noted it scared her not knowing my ""timeline or endpoint."" I started to look for and secured a therapist to start working thru all these things. \n\nAnd the more I explored ""NBness"" the more I realized it just described me as a person. In politics, religion, everything, I had always maintained there was nuance, there was no strict black and white.\n\nThe floodgates opened. I came out to her mom, who would watch our daughter when we were at work. I came out to more and more of my friends. Around Christmas I started playing with wearing some mascara to work and eventually came out to my department. Everyone, and I mean everyone, was so supportive and understanding. \n\nI started presenting more femme at work, wearing full makeup on the two days a week I didn\'t go to the gym, and carrying a purse.\n\n[THE BEGINNING OF THE END]\n\nChristmas Eve. Hosting at our house for the first time. I\'m out to her mom, but no one else in her family. For whatever fucking reason I decide to put on makeup. I think in my mind I was going to be the most gracious host that just HAPPENED to be wearing makeup. It was my opportunity to show that I\'m the same person I\'ve always been. And I blew it.\n\nI don\'t know how it happened. I only remember pouring myself one drink, but I must have had a lot more because I have only VERY fuzzy memories of that night. I barely ever drink a full beer a night, much less get blackout drunk. I crashed out, woke up a few hours later, and started putting together my daughter\'s christmas presents. \n\nIt wasnt until over a week later that Sue decided to fill me in on what happened. Apparently I had ruined a board game by being belligerent. I was being ""bitchy"" and generally just not a very fun person. I really really have no idea what the hell happened. Like I said, I got up after they left and put together gifts and such, I wasn\'t drunk then, and I got up very early the next morning and was not hung over.\n\nBut the cat was out of the bag. Sue had to try to explain to her 1970\'s NYC dad what the hell I was. No one would talk to me directly. We all got the flu and I was miserable both physically and mentally.\n\nHer father met me for lunch when we had all recovered and I was delighted to find he had spent the week or two actually researching what \'non-binary\' meant. We had a very frank and respectful conversation, although he did have one thing that struck me wrong: \n\nHe said, ""if you start a relationship with a person and say, \'you should know I drink a beer every night and if you don\'t like that we shouldnt get together.\' The other person agrees. Over the years, the first person starts drinking a six pack a night. And then a handle of vodka. The other person agreed to one beer, and they have the right to leave."" \n\nI understood what he was saying, but I was so delusional as to how much Sue really did support me. Even as I type out this ridiculously long post, I\'ve skipped over many major fights on the subject. But I always saw the parts where she helped me and gave those more credence.\n\nSue was embarrassed about her mom seeing me go to work in makeup and more femme-presenting.\n\nA month ago, she sat me down and said she had three things to say and that I needed to listen without giving input. She said: \n\n1) I am hurting people by doing what I\'m doing\n\n2) She wishes I was ""normal"" again\n\n3) I don\'t think about how my daughter will be bullied because of me.\n\nI tried to explain to her that I want to live a life of openness and honesty for my daughter. I never want to hide myself from her. And of course I\'ve thought about her getting bullied because of me, but kids get bullied for a lot of reasons and I will work hard to give her the tools to deal with those situations when they arise.\n\nNot satisfied with that, she went on to say that if I don\'t stop then I ""dont care about [my daughter].""\n\nThat hurt. A lot. I was very very upset. I was boiling but asked for space, went to the other side of the house, and took my frustrations out on a cardboard box in the recycling. She followed me, telling me ""youre a 30 year old man and should be able to handle it."" I walked past her repeating ""leave me alone leave me alone"" and she followed. Ironically, I ended up in my closet, huddled on the floor crying and screaming out for help. She mocked me. I started looking for my phone and when I found it I did the only thing I could think to do in my agitated state, I called the Crisis Hotline.\n\nThe woman on the other side of the phone talked me through breathing exercises. I told her what had happened. As I was on the phone, I sat against our bedroom door since it doesnt latch. After 20 minutes, Sam knocked and asked if she could come in. I said no, that I needed space, and she started trying to push her way in. She was on the phone with her mother and mocking how I was crying on the phone with someone. At one point she was pushing very hard against the door and said ""here\'s johnny."" \n\nI deduced she was going to take my daughter to her parents. I arranged to have the crisis call center call me back so I could call the police.\n\nIt was midnight on a Wednesday. It was raining. I was calmed down from my talk on the phone, so I was trying not to re-escalate the situation. I told her not to go, but I didn\'t try to grab her keys or stand behind the car or anything. The crisis center had told me she couldnt just take her so I felt calm in thinking the police would help. When I called them they laughed at me.\n\nI was alone. \n\nAnd I\'ve been alone ever since.\n\nI have taken up WAY too much of everyones time here, so I\'ll spare everyone the details of the kind of toxicity I\'ve been dealing with this month, but it hasnt been great.\n\nI\'ve had my daughter at our house overnight twice since then. I have taken her to the zoo and a museum, I\'ve still gone to her doctors visits. But I mostly see her thru Facetime when Sue is okay with it.\n\nI was informed Friday when I asked to see her this weekend that Sue had gotten a lawyer and wants to sell the house. I won\'t be allowed to see my daughter alone until after mediation is complete.\n\nI\'m so fucking lost and also never been more confident in who I am.\n\nI have a really great friend from work that started after I was ""out"" and she\'s been such a huge support. I\'ve reconnected with my old friends and met so many new friends.\n\nI didn\'t get to see my daughter on easter weekend because I didnt give enough ""notice."" If I didnt have friends around itwould have been really tough. And I realized all the people I was hanging out with and having meaningful and thoughtful conversations with I had known less than a month.\n\nI had to pay the mortgage and bills for the last month, and hadnt been reimbursed for bills for the month before she left. I am so unbelievably broke and busking for money to eat. \n\nI am up for a big promotion so I\'ve had to go in on weekends and stay late.\n\nI havent left my couch all day today. I don\'t even think I\'ve turned on a light for more than a second.\n\nI thought I was one of the lucky ones, but I realize thru my therapy that I\'ve had my blinders on to all those times she wasn\'t supportive. And I really should have seen this coming.\n\nI doubt very seriously anyone is going to read this, but thanks if you did.\n\nTL;DR small town kid gets in touch with their femme side and it goes pretty okay until their entire life falls apart.\n\n\n\n', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'I thought I was one of the lucky ones.', 'created': 1523179951.0}"

2018-04-08 23:10:24,8atwd2,13,7,"Hey guys!   
I've questioned my gender a few times throughout my life. For a while I thought I might be trans but that never felt right, and I eventually just ignored and thought ""Oh I'm a guy--end of story.""  
Recently, I've gone back to questioning. I feel as thought I'm male but I do suffer with a bit of dysphoria and definitely felt a lot of euphoria in my life.  
I feel as thought I'd be more comfortable in a feminine body such as filled out hips, curves etc. Yet, I don't know if I want breasts or enlarged female nipples, in fact it's a bit of a huge con for me (even though many who kinda identify the same way I do have told me they got used to the breasts and ended up liking them) and I'm also afraid that my face will become ""so feminine"" that I'd feel dysphoric bout that as well and look like an ""odd looking guy"". I still want to be a guy but verrrry feminine as I relate heavily to that side and want to be able to do it in a way that does make me look like a man in a dress either.  


Another thing that's been confusing me is the difference between aging as a male and aging as a male on female hormones. Will I continue to get more masculine as I grow older if I decide to not go on hormones? Some other physical differences, etc.  

As you can tell I'm a bit (okay, a lot) confused. I want to be able to pass and wear girl clothes/girly clothes, but when I see female faces/mtfs I feel like that isn't what would make me happy. I guess there is a large lack of AMAB non-binary representation so it makes it a bit harder.  

Also I'm 24/m/and a larger individual as well. I have ""moobs"" if you will. I'm also in a situation where i can't really express myself the way I'd want (religious family etc).

I’m new on Reddit but not so new to the whole transgender thing! After IDing as a binary trans guy for a good few years, I’m realising more and more that this doesn’t actually reflect who I am, and I recently started IDing myself more as a non-binary transmasc person (I’m AFAB)

When I thought I was a binary guy, I chose a stereotypically “male” name for myself and have used that consistently for around a year with certain friends (not family), but it never felt like it fit. Now that I’ve realised that forcing myself into yet another gender box ain’t gunna fly, I’m trying to two-birds-one-stone it with the whole name thing.

The whole way through my childhood, friends often called me by a more gender-neutral variant of my given name - Philly (I’m not from the US so that connotation isn’t as prevalent here). While I really dislike my legal name and feel uncomfortable being referred to with it, the shortened version is one that’s felt like *mine*. However I’m hesitant to start using it for a few reasons:

1) I want a name that’s as gender-neutral as possible and I’m not sure how much of a feminine connotation this name has - it’s shortened from a feminine name but there is a male name that could be shortened in the same way, I’ve just not heard it often?

2) I’m worried it won’t sound enough like a “real name” or that people won’t take it seriously 

3) I’m worried that without changing my name fully, and by continuing to use a nickname I’ve had for years (prior to coming out) people will think it’s not a “serious” change and continue to misgender me etc?

My name is Salem, i'm 18 and afab, and have generally considered myself cis, though i've never looked at it too deeply until the last year or so. 

since i was a kid i've worn ""boy"" clothes but have been comfy in them and never really cared if other girls in my class would say things. when people would mistake me for a boy i wouldn't be surprised or care, or sometimes correct them. 
i used to consider myself bi, but after dating a guy and lying to myself for a few months i felt comfortable with myself and was happier once i came to terms that i liked exclusively women/people identifying as a girl/femme. 
one thing that really struck a cord was how i dressed when i was in this straight relationship. i dressed a lot more feminine than i was used to (by this time i generally wore ""girl"" clothes but i started wearing skirts and crop tops and such) 
at first i thought it made me uncomfortable because i felt like i was fulfilling the typical gender role of a straight woman and it irked me because i was just repressing  about my sexuality. 
two years later i am very happy with the way i present though my straight friend often makes fun of me because it's ""too butch"", though it doesn't bother me. 

i've never felt like she/her pronouns resonated with me like male ones did, but i don't know that i could see myself fully transitioning. i feel some sort of disconnect with the idea of gender and not sure how to express it. i feel what i would describe as strong body dysmorphia when i wear anything that isn't pants and a sweater. i hate the idea of my body representing femininity, unless it is a very specific ""butch"" kind. 
I follow ChellaMan on twitter (transmasc blogger) and his story really resonates with me and i feel almost jealous (?) that he is able to be so comfortable with himself and that he has such a support system. 
i think the only thing holding me back from talking about this with my peers is the social view of nb people in my area (as kids that just want attention) and i'm not sure where else to turn.

They presented a made-up and exaggerated example of a bell curve difference in men and women, and I don't even know how to being yelling that There Is No Single Bell Curve For Who You Are!

I don't know how to explain that their attempt to be Gender Intelligent and inclusive is actually making me feel excluded and unsafe without outing myself.

If this is the direction the company is moving in then being public about my gender identity being constructed mostly from vague hand-wavey gestures and shrugging would probably be an unsafe idea.  Frankly, my RadFem Senses are tingling something fierce.\n\n\n \nCan anyone suggest accessible scientific studies, literature and articles debunking this stuff?

2018-04-11 04:34:41,8beg0e,7,27,"I know you probably get this question all the time, but it's been weighing me down a lot.

I'm AFAB and with my friends the last couple of months I've been identifying as a trans guy. But a part of me feels it's much more likely I'm non-binary or agender. Online in certain parts I've actually been identifying as trans-masculine and it's been working for now but I still don't know if it's really that accurate. 

Also, I know that labels don't really matter but I am obsessed and won't be able to settle down until I get an actual idea of what I can call myself, even if it's just in private.

Well... Here are the facts -

* I don't like she/her pronouns. I don't mind they/them pronouns. He/him pronouns are weird but I think I like these most.

* I have friends both male and female (no NB friends that I know of) and I feel a connection to all of them, but when I'm looking at strangers trying to see if I connect more with the guys or with the girl, it's typically neither. Sometimes it's a little more towards the guys but that depends.

* If I HAD to be seen as one or the other, I'd rather be a guy but I would rather just be neither.

* I honestly, truly wish I lived in a genderless world. 

* Some days I feel like I'm definitely non-binary and I'm just fooling myself by sticking to the binary because it would be easier and I have some internalized shit to sort out when I think of non-binary identities.

* I kind of want to identify as agender and say I ""don't have a *specific* gender"" but I know that doesn't really fit the definition all that well.

* When it comes to bathrooms, I very, very heavily prefer gender neutral bathrooms and feel most comfortable there, though I don't hate the women's bathroom and I haven't tried the men's bathroom due to anxiety.

* In a way, I feel like partially every gender and partially none at all, though clearly more male than female. I feel very ""other"" most of the time.

* I get some dysphoria, mostly about my chest, sometimes about my genitals (honestly, my preferred genitals would be the bottom growth on T and nothing else), my name, and mildly about pronouns/being called a girl.

* Sometimes I don't hate my feminine body, but I almost wish it were a costume I could take off most of the time. Which I know is not an option, but it's how I feel.

Well, I think that just about covers it. I'm also in the process of getting a therapist but there's a chance they won't be a gender therapist because I haven't come clean to my parents about my questioning and even still, the process is slow going.

Thanks for being here, by the way.

2018-04-12 06:58:58,8bo8oz,8,17,"quick intro: after lurking on /r/nonbinary and /r/genderqueer and /r/genderfluid for a few weeks, I finally created an account. I'm AMAB, polysexual (essentially pan, but excluding cis men and possibly cis women), parent, legal alien in a country that's not my birth country, and I consider myself among the first round of millennials. Many years ago, still in the early stages of my ""awakening"", I became more aware of my non-straightness when my then-girlfriend came out to me, telling me she was not born in a woman's body, and my immediate reaction was ""and?"" and i realized that I'm attracted to her as a person, not a person of a specific gender.

It was around that time that I stumbled upon a kilt store in Seattle. My curiosity drove me in, their sales team was great, and in the end, I left money there, and was so thrilled that i left even more money the next day. My favorite was a version in heather gray, with pleats and four hidden pockets; their most feminine kilt version. Here's a picture of one: http://farm1.staticflickr.com/196/508273770_b1c84ad4c8_o.jpg.

And so began the discovery of my own non-binaryness.

The modern kilt gave me something important: an excuse to wear a skirt in public, including to work. People put it off as a fad, some thought i was a fashion victim. I even got one that matched my suit, so i wouldn't have to wear pants at work functions anymore. A manager at work once told me i should dress more professionally, and i asked him if he said that because of my gender, or because unbiforcated garments are inappropriate (he dropped the matter only after i asked him if we should go to HR together and find out whether they think there's a problem... he didn't want to). In stores, if a kid exclaimed loudly ""this man is wearing a skirt!"" then after the kid's parent corrected (or shushed) them, i could calmly say to the parents: ""your kid is right, though. Technically, a kilt is a kind of skirt."" and fortunately most of them took it with humor or said they liked it or asked where i bought it :)

Eventually, i became more aware that my taste in clothing was not limited to things that are marketed to men. Yet, my anxiety prevented me from deviating more overtly in my presentation. Also, style options were limited: I'm just not that much a fan of floral patterns or glitter, and I didn't want to wear clothing just because it was marketed to women. It also needed to fit me, I needed to like the way it looked on me, and it needed to be comfortable. I also have a few hoodies and t-shirts I like that are purple and/or have some prints that i think are more likely to be worn by women, but nobody ever mentioned anything. Worst that happens is that (usually older) people burst out in laughter in public when they spot the small unicorn on one of my sweaters, and when i turn around to look at them, they apologize and sometimes i can even make very brief small-talk before they skedaddle.

Then i discovered overalls. Sure, they're marketed to men in workwear stores; but it's mostly women wearing them casually (albeit often with extremely short legs or otherwise impractical). But still, bingo: another piece of clothing that i had an excuse to wear. If anything, i may have appeared a bit ""odd"" to others. And heck, they're comfortable! Came summer, though, they got a bit too warm, and i got a bit more daring and decided to hem the legs off one of my denim overalls at knee height. I got a few comments on it, mostly positive, including the most awesome comment of all: After a friend's mum asked me where they sell shortalls for men and i told her i couldn't find any so i had to alter one myself, she said they look ""cute"" on me. Nobody's ever called me that before, and it felt so good! I just never told anyone before how good that comment felt to me at the time...

That said, to go with my legwear, I sport red Dr. Martens, and I think one of my next pairs will be Docs that i so far always wanted to buy but never dared to, because they're listed under ""Womens"".

I can tell that I am slowly beginning to stop caring what other people think, and to assert myself (thanks again to my therapist for helping me work through those anxieties). If someone says to me that it's odd for a man to wear XYZ, I simply ask them: ""why's that?"" and then watch them realize their own bias. Or if someone says ""they're woman's pants, because the zipper fly opens on the wrong side"" i reply ""really? why... what does the side of the fly have to do with gender?"". All of those conversations have gone well so far, even in other western countries I've visited. The worst comment i got was at a train station in Germany when an older person commented: ""You're quite a colorful bird, aren't you?"" but it was a rhetorical question and i'm not quite sure what to make of it.

But despite my ""progress"", I find myself looking for more options that I can use to push the boundaries of my presentation without risking too much.

So far I have: Kilts, Overalls, Shortalls, colorful shoes. Does anyone have other suggestions for what I could add, that fall into this low-risk boundary-pushing category?

TL;DR: Some people think that gender-neutral clothing for AFAB people would mean a hoodie and saggy pants, my search for the needle in a haystack is something like that but in reverse. Something that's more feminine, but on the careful side of things. Something that would offer me an ""excuse"" if i really needed one to defend against assholes. I couldn't find any similar posts (maybe i was looking in the wrong subreddits?)

So I was grocery shopping with my boyfriend and he wanted to buy me Mon Cheri pralines, which contain a little bit of alcohol.

I'm new here and I'm still trying to figure out how I want to present in public.

I recalled a memory the other day that I think is very relevant.  I was out shopping, and it crossed my mind that I wanted to buy some protein powder, and I just so happened to walk past a shop that sells body-building supplements, and so I walked in and asked which product I might like.

The gentleman running the shop was dressed a bit oddly.  He had an unusual hairstyle, and I recall that he was wearing four rings in each ear.  I would say that he looked as if he just stepped off the set of a ""Lord of the Rings"" movie.  He confidently told me which product he recommended, and while I made my selection, I watched him confidently banter with several other customers.

The thing I recall about him was that his presentation was very unusual.  You could say that he was peacocking with his earrings and hairstyle, and yet he presented himself in a manner that he was completely confident in the way he had adorned himself.  There was not the least trace of any fear of what anyone would make of his appearance.  This was a man who was completely comfortable in his own skin, or at least if he wasn't, he was good at pretending.

I stopped wearing bras altogether a year ago due to discomfort and dysphoria. I love it and I never intend to wear one again. I don't agree with society's ridiculous taboos around feminine breasts/nipples at all, but I'm still having trouble dealing with it in my everyday life. When I go outside of my house, I feel compelled to wear mid-to-heavyweight fabrics (hoodies, sweaters) simply to provide ""cover"" to my nipples, which are distinctly femme: if I wear lightweight fabrics, you can see the contours of my nipples very well, and if the fabric is light in color, you can make out the darker skin pigment too. I wish I didn't have worries about this but I do.

Once I decided to wear a light colored t-shirt out, only to have someone yell at me to put a bra on. She actually yelled. In my face. Angrily. Because I was wearing a t-shirt? ""Put a fucking bra on!"" (actual quote). I felt a wave of shame and embarrassment wash over me and put on my hoodie.

I want to be strong about this. I know that there's NOTHING wrong with what I'm doing but I still feel like I have to alter my behavior for the sake of the people who think I'm doing something wrong. When I go out or go to work (an arguably hip company with the most lax of dress codes), I feel like I'm doing a bad thing if I wear a t-shirt. I feel like there's a very good chance I get called into Human Resources if I wear a t-shirt. In public, I feel vulnerable to interactions like the one I mentioned. 

Where do you find the strength to deal with this shit? 

I'm venting but also looking for thoughts. I know one answer is ""don't wear light colors/light fabrics"" but fuck that. Everyone should be able to go shirtless as far as I'm concerned. I want to be stronger.

This study will help us better understand how eating disorder symptomatology and body image dissatisfaction differ between LGBTQ+ and heteronormative populations, in order to best support these populations. This study has been approved by the Pacific University Institutional Review Board (#166-17).
You are invited to participate if you: 1) Are 18 years of age or older 2) English literate 3) Identify as at least one of the following: a. Cisgender b. Transgender c. LGBQ+ d. Heterosexual

2018-04-15 17:09:27,8cgiyt,12,16,"Hello all, 

Quite a short and quick question. I've been identifying more and more as non-binary genderfluid recently, oscillating mainly between feeling ""almost masculine"" and feeling ""almost feminine"", with a little middle ground. I'm AMAB, so on the days I feel more masculine I'm generally quite okay with having a male body, and presenting as a male, but on the days where I clearly feel feminine I can get really dysphoric, it can be quite intense. It's got me thinking recently about HRT, but those days where I feel more masculine throw me off because I'm sort of scared of a ""what if I then get dysphoric over the secondary characteristics I made happen myself through HRT?"".
So my question is just this: any non-binary people who have been on HRT, has it ever happened that you feel dysphoric over your newly developed secondary characteristics when maybe you feel more aligned with the gender you were assigned at birth?

I'm afab bi-gender (girl and guy) and have been on T for nearly a year. I love the changes I'm get getting, mostly. By some miracle my speaking voice hasn't changed - one of two things I didn't want out of HRT (the other being hair changes). I want to physically be a guy (I have scheduled top surgery and have consult this fall for meta) but I want to be seen as a girl (yes I plan to get breast forms the same size as my current natural boobs). 

However, when on a full guy swing, I want more. I want to let my beard grow, cut my hair (I currently have a unisex cut), be a guy totally. But I still don't want my (liberal, mostly accepting) community to see me as a guy. I love my silk skirts, my earrings, my femme image. It makes me feel somehow powerful, being a girl on the surface. Powerful like Wonder Woman or Xena (two of the female figure types I aspire to). I don't want to give up these things.

But recently I dressed full masc to visit a support group in another city.  While it didn't have that same feeling of empowerment as dressing full femme, I felt amazingly comfortable in my skin in a completely different way. I was able to simply relax into being a guy.

I was AFAB and she/her pronouns have always been fine, but I’m pretty androgynous. I frequently get mistaken for a male, which doesn’t bother me, but I also get referred to by he/him pronouns and it made me really uncomfortable. I know how odd that sounds. 

I’ve never expressed myself in a feminine way, nor have I ever really been interested in doing so. I’ll wear a dress from time to time, but I don’t enjoy it. 

I even kind of like it when people can’t tell if I’m male or female. Is that weird?

There is one thing that’s getting me though - I don’t like labels. There’s only one label I can’t get away from and that’s disabled. I have 2 disabilities and I’ve accepted them as part of my identity, but for some reason, being labelled as non-binary doesn’t feel right...

I still have a lot to learn, but right now, I don’t even know what questions to ask. I hope this post made some kind of sense to someone.

I used to use yoga classes as an excuse to wear them.  The male anatomy gets in the way, but now that I identify as enby, I feel like I have the right to tuck the equipment out of the way.

I've heard people complain that women who wear leggings are being immodest and ""showing off"".  Maybe they are, but who cares when you can wear such a comfortable garment!

So, besides being part of my enby presentation, what do I love about leggings so much?

They cover my legs without the discomfort I associate with other types of pants.

Especially when they don't have a waistband, they just fit like a second skin around my waist.  I can't tell you how much I *do not miss* having a belt tightly pinching the waist of my pants against my skin and seeing the red band that it leaves on my skin that I had taken for granted for decades.

Ever sit for a long car/train/plane ride and squirm uncomfortably in your seat as your belt rubs the top of your pants against your skin?  Not with leggings, you don't!

I can\'t tell you how much I *do not miss* having a belt tightly pinching the waist of my pants against my skin and seeing the red band that it leaves on my skin that I had taken for granted for decades.\n\nEver sit for a long car/train/plane ride and squirm uncomfortably in your seat as your belt rubs the top of your pants against your skin?  Not with leggings, you don\'t!\n\nOh yes, and I also do not miss wearing jeans that snag and pull at my joints as I move about.\n\nIf I were a poet, I\'d have to write a sonnet about my leggings!\n\nThat is all.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'I really love to wear leggings!', 'created': 1524094430.0}"

2018-04-20 10:44:30,8dmmsr,1,19,"My wife and I attended the Blackheart Burlesque last night, hosted by the Suicide Girls. It was a sexy, funny, creative good time overall, but there was also a very uplifting moment.

Near the end of the show, the host invited any and all women in the audience to the stage, for a sexy dance-off competition. 

The only rule? There are no rules.

Probably twenty or so attractive women made their way to the stage. In that group was someone clearly going for an androgynous look. I dare say they were non binary. No hips, masculine clothes and haircut.  Very skinny. Androgynous large glasses. Flat chest. The only vague hint about their identified gender was the fact that they were on stage, specifically at the invitation for women only. 

The dancing lasted for a couple minutes. Everyone had a gimmick to try and win the dance competition. A couple girls started making out. Many others stripped down to their panties with huge exaggerated movements - it was that kind of show.

Not this non binary person, though; she/they just swayed slowly, kind of shyly. They undid the clasp and zipper of their pants, and lowered them slightly, revealing completely masculine boxer-briefs. They lowered the underwear just low enough to *not* reveal any hints about their genitals.

I still couldn't tell you what their 'assigned' gender was. Not that it mattered. 

In the end, the winner was selected by audience reactions and applause. I'll cut to the chase; the audience *loved* our non binary friend. They won in a landslide. 

That felt really uplifting. That a huge, mixed crowd full of people - who all came to see a bunch of strip teases from beautiful women with bouncing breasts - recognized the modern beauty of this androgynous audience member, really made my night.

I searched the subreddit and couldn't find any similar enough answers, so I hope it's okay that I ask this.

Like the title says, I noticed last night that my AFAB sibling changed their Facebook pronouns to they/them. I want to do my best to be a supportive brother, but this came as a bit of a surprise to me. I've referred to them as sister (she/her) my entire life (I'm in my 20s) - I understand that much of this subreddit goes through the trouble of dealing with family and I don't want to cause my sibling any more distress than they might be going through already.

Should I approach them about this? I understand that they should approach me on their own time and that I shouldn't force this upon them. At the same time, I don't want to misgender them when speaking to others. This is a conversation I would rather have in person, but we live 7,000 miles apart from each other and that really isn't feasible for the next few months. When we last saw each other 2 months ago, they were still using she/her pronouns to the best of my knowledge.

Some more background on our relationship, they identified as not straight before changing FB pronouns and came out to me before to our parents. We enjoy a healthy relationship; not constant contact but we very much care for each other as family and friends. 

So asking NB people who have experiences with siblings, how would you have wanted them to respond after coming out? I expect answers to vary across the board, I'm looking for at least some direction.

2018-04-22 21:02:14,8e66rh,6,4,"I'm just going to put this in a list to help myself out. 

1. I know for a fact I'm trans and have dysphoria(even if half the time I'm doubting whether I'm inventing it or not because my chest/bottom dysphoria didn't begin afaik until I realized I was trans but I had other signs of dyshphoria) 

2. I know I'm not at all a woman even if it took steps to pull away from that. First I id'd as bigender(woman and demiboy/boy) then androgyne(still a mix of boy and girl), neutrois, and finally agender(though I’m trying to figure out if agenderflux/agender+male or whatever the mess is more appropriate). 

3. The problem now is I can't tell if I still don't want to let go of what's familiar to me and say I'm completely binary trans man and I'm inventing my dysphoria about not wanting phallo because the penis would be too large(although I still don't want it for various other reasons) and inventing it about other things. 

4. The problem is that I also have dysphoria about basically everything with this body pre-t. I absolutely know for sure I want t, top surgery, meta w/possible scrotoplasty and the works, but I have such a bad opinion of he/him pronouns, being seen as a man(though I would take them in public to be comfortable because I know I want facial hair etc, it would hurt me if someone who knew I really wasn't a man to use he/him) etc. 

5. I know I love women and I've known since I was 12/13, been using the bi label since I was around 14(originally came out as a lesbian). The problem is that if I'm a dude, I know I'm not attracted to men/people who are leaning toward that and that I'm exclusively attracted to women and other non-men, which, in my mind only, means that I can't be bi and would be a straight man, which I just can't take, personally. I also don’t want my attraction to women to have to change, or know that, as a person seen as a man, I would feel like I can’t enjoy the wlw ships I have for a very long time and found an immense amount of identity in(Marceline/Princess Bubblegum from Adventure Time, basically all of my ships from Degrassi, ships from The 100, etc, etc) Along with this, I'm scared of cis straight women thinking I'm a man and being into me/wanting me to perform in a way a cis guy interested in women would, and similarly scared of not attracting bi women who are interested in nonbinary people as a nonbinary person.

6. This is just an internalized racism thing and I'm fully aware but I don't want to be a black man. I don't have anything in common with the universal black man experience, mostly because, while it's stereotypical and I know all black men aren't like this, I'm not interested in collecting Jordan's and doing all of that other stuff. Which I know doesn't make anyone a man but in my mind it does, and I don't do those things. I feel like if I was white I wouldn't worry about this part nearly as much for obvious reasons, but I don't want to walk around this world being seen as a black man(which, again I really want facial hair so I would deal with it but it would be severely uncomfortable especially for dating). 

My real thing is that I just want to be me, but with all the 'nonbinary people aren't real/nonbinary people are cis' stuff it's super invalidating and I've literally spent every day for the past month or so probably thinking 'am I really just a trans guy/the best I could qualify is nonbinary trans guy I could never call myself a man/ I like being called a gentleman/handsome etc and I like taking a masculine role in relationships blah blah blah but I can’t just take the final leap'. I just feel like I want to be a man in everything but name/brain wise, if that makes any sense, like I want to ‘look like a man’ but can’t handle people treating me like one.  

I just want to be able to let this go and focus on being on t etc but it’s gonna be a whole nother year before I can move and start since I’m in college rn with no options. So until then I’ll have to waffle back and forth. 
Edit: Wow okay this is even longer than I thought in reddit format, reformatted.

TL;DR: I want to be a man in everything but name but I'm afraid that that's just me being afraid of being a straight black man, that I won't be myself anymore and won't be attractive/will be attractive to people assuming I'm cis/a binary man.

2018-04-22 21:25:21,8e6c59,5,20,"I started T October 2017 and wanted to stop exactly one year on it, as I'd had the changes that I personally needed from hormones. My face and body were perfectly androgynous and I hardly had any facial hair to speak of.

I remembered thinking that facial hair would be this super validating thing for me to have before starting T. I never actually had much chest dysphoria but felt this pressure to bind even though I never really minded my chest. Presently, I quite like it and if I'm being perfectly frank, it sometimes gives me gender euphoria when I'm having a good boob day.

I tried briefly to stop hormones and to express my gender in a more traditionally feminine way, only to feel ostracized by the trans students on my campus and later much of the under 25 LGBT community online. Funny how the internet loves ""softbois,"" or femme trans men, yet finds ways to make genderfluidity problematic.

Those who expressed disapproval were accusing me of enjoying feminine expression as just a sexual kink, which is funny considering that when I'm expressing my masculinity, I wear the tightest skinny jeans I can fit myself into while packing and wear low v neck t shirts to show off my chest hair. I'm a highly sexual person regardless and I express it when I'm feeling it.

Fast forward to now, my body hair has become so thick that it almost isn't human in comparison to cis men. It's so thick that if I leave it alone, it gets caught in my clothes and gets ripped out. If I shave it, it's even worse because the stubble is coarse enough to scrape others if they accidentally run their hands over it.

At this point I'm pursuing laser hair removal just to thin the hair out, not even remove it. Yet because of this, the fact that I've stopped testosterone and have no intention of having top surgery, any trans person I've talked to about this who's my age (24) or younger thinks I'm detransitioning.

But the reality is that my medical transition has only begun.

If I had to succinctly explain my gender identity to someone, I would use Baphomet as an example. I'm a total gym rat and I love the muscle mass that T has afforded me but I also love my breasts and sometimes question whether having them bigger would increase my gender euphoria. I miss my curves; I used to have some nice hips and a round butt but T has made them vanish. I'm planning to have metoidioplasty upon exiting the adult industry, where I present as a binary woman. (Not because I need to, I want to make that quite clear.)

I'm open to going on T again in the future. But my main source of frustration at this point is feeling so misunderstood by the community. Others have regarded me as confused or have made harsh remarks about people who detransition, which isn't fair to people who do choose that.

Any time I've tried to talk to someone under 25 about this, I'm always hit with this social justice lecture about how gender is just a social construct and how it's problematic to label primary or secondary sexual characteristics, clothing, makeup, hair, body language, whatever, as masculine or feminine. Give me a break. If those things really were meaningless, then nobody would transition.

2018-04-23 23:58:05,8eg5oq,13,25,"Hi everyone! I’m an AFAB non-binary, genderqueer person. I have an appointment on Friday to talk about going on a “low dose” of testosterone. Does anybody else have any experience with this? Some notes about my reasoning and knowledge about it -

• I know that I can’t “pick and choose” what effects I’m going to get, and I’m not trying to
• I know the effects of testosterone will eventually level off at some point, they aren’t permanently cumulative (you don’t see cis men, for example, constantly being more masculinized after puberty due to the natural testosterone levels in their systems)
• I know testosterone is a stronger hormone than estrogen, effects-wise
• I know everyone has different androgen sensitivity levels

My boyfriend is a trans man and he is taking 50mg of T every week, so I have a pretty good firsthand idea of what the effects are, though I know it varies for everyone. I think I’d like to start at 25mg a week and adjust the dosage if needed, depending on how quickly things go, how I feel, etc.

Basically, I want to try and “level out” my appearance, voice, hair, etc. to be more balanced between the effects of estrogen and testosterone. I know it won’t be completely even or anything. I want to be more ambiguous. I feel like it will help me not only physically and socially, but mentally as well. Ideally, my end goal would be for me to find he right dosage to where I could be forever gender-ambiguous in that way, and be able to play up or down my masculinity or femininity depending on how I feel.

2018-04-28 05:08:20,8fhtdg,6,43,"Hello, late Generation X here. I used to identify as male and am typically read as such. About a 1-1/2 years ago, I ran into a dear friend who used the word ""non-binary"" when telling me about the team at her workplace. She said ""non-binary"" in such a casual context, like any other word, that there was not a good opportunity for me to ask what it meant. But I googled the heck out of it later. 

I was more focused on figuring out what ""non-binary"" meant, that i missed the invitation to explore what ""feeling not bound to the gender binary"" could mean to me. Fortunately, several months later, I encountered the gender unicorn, and with no pre-defined sliders, I wanted to fill it out and see where i could see myself on the spectrum. It helped me break out of the binary thinking pattern, allowing me to see myself more wholly, and it felt very liberating. I realized I have never shied away from doing things that some consider girl/women interests"", and don't like to conform to others' expectations, including presentation, and i openly refuse to participate in some ""male"" associated behaviors and activities. So i realized that nothing really had to change, even though i found an explanation, a new perspective, and a motivation to go be myself more, and be more comfortable being myself.

Yesterday during a work meeting with my immediate team, a diversity subject came up with a subtle hint to non-binary gender identities, followed by a gender distribution example that mentioned ""20% males"". My team responded ""80% women? How's that equal?"" and without taking a pause to think clearly, i said ""That's not how this works."" My entire team looked at me, waiting for an explanation, so I continued: ""I mean, it's 2018, is the gender binary really still so important?"". It seemed like my team thought i made a joke, maybe one that they didn't get. Their reaction wasn't threatening or disrespectful, more like baffled or confused. Only one coworker looked at me funny, as if he had already suspected. I saw that my entire team would continue to be blind to the gender non-binary if i didn't take another stab at getting an explanation across. And i thought the best way was to reveal to them that they know someone who is nobinary, and it's OK. I explained: ""I felt it important to mention, because i'm part of the 80% in the example that was brought up. I'm non-binary. It's nothing new, there's just usually no need to tell people about it.""

I gave no further explanation, and nobody asked a question (not that i expected any). They all continued to treat me the same way as far as I can tell, probably  because we all get along well and they already noticed that i'm not conforming to cis gender norms, even if they didn't have a good label for that. 

At the end of the day today, one of my colleagues came to me and confessed: ""You know, after you told me what you told me yesterday, i went to my spouse and asked her if she knew what nonbinary meant, because i didn't. Usually, she knows such things, but she didn't know either. So i googled it. An hour later, she asked me if I had figured it out and i had to tell her that I've been reading stuff on the internet about it for an hour, that i have a bit of an idea of what it might mean, but i'm still not entirely sure."" - I told him that this is what it feels like to me sometimes, too, and he replied ""I believe it."" ;-)

TLDR: when my team misunderstood a diversity-related subject that hinted at non-binary gender identification, i tried to clarify but the team misunderstood again. I felt an obligation to end non-binary invisibility for them, and found the best way was to reveal myself as non-binary, without big explanation, figuring they'd either ask or google it.

It made me feel great. I don't want to be male, but just someone using different pronouns than I'm used to felt amazing :D I guess a rush of gender euphoria, idk...
I use they/them only online because in my mother tongue it is a little bit more complicated with the gender neutral pronouns, although they do exist. 
I'm not sure I like they/them better than she or he but I just feel like it fits better? Like it doesn't make me feel any different (or the same way he makes me feel), but I just like that it's out of the binary and not forcing gender (expectations) on me.
At the same time I'm thinking that it's far too complicated asking everybody to use pronouns that no one has ever heard of out of lgbtq+ circles and if it's really that important to me?

I switch between being certain on all four fronts all the time, so I\'m mostly looking for something that really catches me. \n\nAny advice will help, even those ""coming from the other direction"".
