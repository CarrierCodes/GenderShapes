A friend of mine in the local community is taking some pretty heavy flak for their work helping address some horrible misogynistic bullshit at a university the work at. They are being bashed in the media and worse over violently misgendered (they identify as a nonbinary transperson, and some transphobic assholes make that grounds for attack). This as left them obviously upset and dysphoric. 

I myself being a transgirl combat the dysphoria I feel by doing gender affirming things like wearing something pretty or doing my makeup really well, but this has raised the question for me so I thought I'd ask this community: as a person who is nonbinary what do you do to help you cope? What kind of self-care do you employ to easy any dysphoric feelings?

Also I'd like to know for future use if there is anything I can do to better support nonbinary people and help be affirming to them? Obviously I use pronouns as requested, but I'd love to know any way I can support my NB community better. 

Thanks for reading!
