When I was in high school, I seriously considered the idea that I might be male because I felt I was missing a penis. I didn't *feel* male, except for the desire for male parts, but I also didn't feel wholly female either. Now that I'm a bit older and have a bit more experience, I realize that I'm nonbinary, at least in some way. I don't have a desire to make a full transition, but I'm still feeling like I have the gentalia.
