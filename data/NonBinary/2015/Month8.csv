I'd like to talk to an expert in the field of endocrinology who has dealt with non-binary people before and won't give me any hassle. 

I don't want to disclose too many details of my location, but I'll say that I live in Southern California. Are there some doctors like this in this area? Perhaps a list or resource that someone could kindly point me to? I would really appreciate it, and thanks in advance.   

EDIT: I think I may need to provide some more information. I'm a guy but I want a more feminine figure. Not breasts, and getting ED is unacceptable to me. So I'm trying to figure out some kind of tricky hormone regimen that can do this. I have some ideas but I need a consult to see if they're safe.

Lets talk about masturbating while non-binary! I am physically female and most of the time I am content with that, but tonight, as I put on the porn video, I wanted to be a boy.

So you know what I did?!

I grabbed my clit like one would a cock (well except it was with just my thumb and index finger as opposed to a whole hand) and I jerked it as if it were a small cock.

The orgasm that followed was so amazing!! I had to slow down a little, else it would be too intense and I would yell out... can't do that when everyone is home, lol.

So I was wondering, to those that do masturbate, how do you do it, or if you got any advice or tips, on masturbating when you aren't feeling like your physical gender.

I really would like to know, since this was the very first time I did it and it kinda just came out of no where to just jerk my tiny dick, instead of playing with my clit.
