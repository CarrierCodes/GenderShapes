I personally think it's short-sighted and not really in place with it's consumers' best interests in mind and go on about why and what can possibly be done about it [here](http://uniquelyevil.tumblr.com/post/108203265109/facebook-will-have-blood-on-its-hands-if-it).

And before anyone goes on about 'Oh! Well if you don't like it don't sign up for Facebook/leave Facebook!'

It's their site.
Yeah.
But are you paying attention to people's reasoning?
Just because they produced something doesn't mean they're above critique, feedback, criticism, and change. Especially when it's something that's potentially endangering people and they don't even take the time or effort to handle these things on a case-by-case basis.
It's one thing to tell people not to sign up for FB, but for those who have been using it for years it's not that easy to just walk away from all of your relationships and groups. And it's definitely fucked up to just cut them off from all their contacts and pretty much tell them they can't have access to any of them until they do as you tell them. And the whole government ID thing? That's bullshit. They have no right asking people for that if they're not making some sort of purchase. People shouldn't have to make that decision. It's a stupid policy that needs to change already.
Not to mention this policy makes it easy for people to be [targeted](http://realnamepolice.tumblr.com/) by people who seem to have no hobbies. 

If you have any other ideas or resources that would be helpful with this effort please let me know!!

And if not, simply spreading the word, signing the petition and letting Facebook know how you feel would be more than enough! Thank you!
