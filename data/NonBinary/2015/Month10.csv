I'm part of a team that's trying to create a new fitness website (I know, there are a million, but bear with me here), and I really want to be inclusive of non-binary gendered individuals. The website would allow individuals to create a character based on themselves, and though we have [obviously] had no problems finding examples to base our male and female characters on, I'm not certain how to be truly inclusive.
My initial thought was that I wanted characters that were truly androgynous, but I didn't really know if that's what the community would want. I feel really stupid for not knowing, but then I remembered that Reddit exists for a reason.

But honestly, I have struggled a long time with both binary gender's attitudes and thought processes towards each other, I'm not quite sure what I am, why I think and feel this way, I dunno, I just feel outside of it all but I'm not quite sure.
