The pro would be: I dislike people referring to me as a man and even just thinking of me as a man, which everyone does now. I don't know why, it's just uncomfortable. So if I told people, then they would hopefully stop and I would feel a little better sometimes. 

There are a bunch of cons though: I don't have any pronoun preference so for the most part I currently don't have a problem with how people talk about me (unless they specify the gender they assume I am). Also since I wouldn't be asking people to change pronouns they might think me telling them is pointless and be annoyed or confused and forget to stop thinking of me as a man. Also no one in real life will understand it like everyone here does and I'll have to explain it and many people just might be like ""So what?"". And I'm really unconfident so when they question its validity I probably will too and make myself seem ridiculous and I'll end up just telling them to forget I said anything. Also I'm not even totally sure that I'm non-binary and I don't think I ever will be sure. It's difficult for me to grasp my own gender. I'm only like 50% sure I'm non-binary and 50% questioning. Also I don't ""look"" typically non-binary, which of course doesn't mean anything, but you know people.

Does anyone maybe have any advice?

2015-04-07 22:00:21,31stco,3,8,"    Hey everyone!

    I’m doing a survey of non-binary pronoun use for my Language and Gender class.   It’s anonymous and mostly demographic information.  I’m trying to get an idea of who uses what pronouns and why, a topic that surprisingly hasn’t been studied before, as far as I can tell.

    If you use pronouns other than he/him/his or she/her/hers and/or if you identify as another gender besides man or woman, i would really appreciate it if you would take this survey. 

    Here’s the link:
