I want to take HRT (though am still a long way off of doing so) but I took note that one of the side effects of it is that you would have clit growth.  is that true with HRT, or just T, or both? Would it be as drastic for either choice? Would the sensitivity of my clit be heightened or lessened?  And would I be able to ""rub one out"" like normal? And I'm sure this is dependant on the person, but would it be possible for mine to not grow much, but if it got to the point where I was uncomfortable could I get it surgically reduced?

[Pictures of me](http://imgur.com/a/d8v4E)

My goal is for people to be unsure whether I am male or female. My hair is naturally thick wavy/curly, its just short at the moment. I'm also going to be getting glasses soon, most likely [these ones](https://www.etsy.com/listing/194401973/handmade-vintage-bamboo-glasses?ref=shop_home_active_1). My wardrobe is super simple at the moment, just unisex v-necks of various colors and slim black jeans. I was considering short hair with long bangs.... could that maybe work? I am rather unsure as to what route I should take, and there's not really anybody I can talk to about this.

So please and thank you, any advice you have for a fellow non-binary fellow? :)
