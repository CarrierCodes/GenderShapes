I have a gender, I know I do, but it's not even between the binary genders that we use as a base for describing ourselves. Every gender I've found is tied to that original binary concept, even if it's just used as a base. 

So I say I'm agender, but it's because I have no gender that can be described in language, not because I am genderless. And it's frustrating and alienating. I've never met anyone who's shared this feeling. Or, if I have, they haven't said anything about it. The linear form of Boy &lt;--------&gt; Girl we rely on to explain and understand different genders works for most people but it very, very much does not work for me. I looked up some other genders and none of them fit me. At all. So I did some research and came up with aliusgender (a-loose), a combination  of the latin word for other/another and gender. I like it a lot, personally. But I also get nervous I'll be told that I'm trying too hard to be unique, i wanna be a snowflake, ect. I've dealt with a lot of that bull, so its gotten to me before. But I'm trying to be comfortable and be capable of describing my experiences as a nonbinary, non linear trans person.

2015-12-10 15:27:18,3w8f0y,2,5,"So, having for years wondered what i am - crossdresser, transvestite, or some other thing, i have in the last few months had that whole delicious experience of going ""oh, that's a thing"" - and concluded i am ""non binary"", i think.

Lots of little clues, but they only make sense in retrospect - i started dressing young, and perhaps more importantly i have never had a seperate identity in my head - i am not someone else when i dress, i don't have a femme alter ego, or even a ""girl name"".

More, i suppose, to the point, all the female things i do are a part of me all the time, as although some days i feel more feminine than others, and express it in more ways, there are not times when that is not a constant, consistent part of me.

Anyway, the other thing has always been cause - it never felt like nurture, i was pretty much a toddler when i started to feel this compulsion, so it must be something ""you are born with"", although frankly i think it doesn't matter. You don't get born a doctor, you choose to be a doctor - so what, you are still a doctor, and by the way thank you for helping us all live longer.

Anyway, having wobbled off course, here is the thing. I was circumcised when i was 6. One of my mums other brilliant ideas, like the violin, horse riding and ballet lessons i think, and it was probably within months of that, certainly before i was 7, that i was wearing my sisters clothes and feeling pretty pleased with myself about it.

2015-12-16 00:57:11,3x0mar,9,4,"Hey,
I have had gender dysphoria since 6th grade and I am now a freshman in college. I hope to finally bring it up with my therapist soon. It has caused me great distress and sadness, which in turn gives me guilt since I have an otherwise great life. I am very hesitant to attempt to transition to another gender since I know it can totally destroy my life. I also like many aspects of being male but there are definite times when I wish I wasn't. I don't really believe you should just transition because you are feminine. I enjoy some feminine things sometimes but this could just be a fetish. Being a woman is way more complex and isn't necessarily dependent on wearing ""female"" clothes or makeup. I was wondering what your thoughts are on my situation.
