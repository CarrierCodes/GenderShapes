Just to tell you a bit about myself. I'm a long long time redditor and have had experience moderating and creating several subreddits in the past. I'm an aviation major, studying to become an international airline pilot, and am a musician and lover of art, culture, history, and anything creative! I myself am non-binary (agender), AMAB, looking to transition to a female body, and am always here to help, whether for advice, or this subreddit's moderation needs! 

I visit this subreddit several times a day, so feel free to contact me whenever. I'll reply asap. 

Thanks again. I'm really looking forward to being a part of reddit's /r/nonbinary community. :)",NonBinary,Hey guys!

It appears the old steam group ""GENDERQUEER"" was deleted by the creator. I have created a new actively-managed group to replace it called simply ""Genderqueer"".
