This subreddit was just born today, and I'm really glad that you came to check it out. The purpose of this space is to foster the emerging culture that is centered on the needs, concerns, thoughts, and feelings of those who don't ascribe to a binary definition of sexual-orientation. In broader terms, it is also a place for people to explore the gray areas when it comes to human gender identity. There are already subreddits that deal with similar issues (r/bisexual, r/bisexualadults, and r/genderqueer), but there is no subreddit prepared to meet the needs of people who are nonbinary in both aspects.

Who's welcome here? Anyone. Everyone. People who need to find their cultural center and those who want to learn more about bisexual/omnisexual/pansexual/asexual/demisexual/etc culture and how it might different from straight, gay, and lesbian cultural groups. Jokes, question, anecdotes, images, photos - it's all good. What won't be tolerated? Bigotry and threatening language. Harassment. We get enough of that from meatspace, don't we? 

So, in summary, welcome welcome welcome!",NonBinary,Welcome everyone!,1350720137.0,"{'created_utc': 1350694937, 'id': '11s0xj', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 2, 'selftext': ""Hi everyone!\n\nThis subreddit was just born today, and I'm really glad that you came to check it out.

I think my first exposure to it was when I was at a leadership training camp (affectionately called gay-camp) before our drag show. Someone was dressed in a guy's button up and girl pants and shoes. She said this was her way of cross-dressing because normally she'd wear a girl's shirt and guy's pants; she didn't strongly identify as female. 

I didn't really get it. I thought it was just her not being 100% girly. But that doesn't make her less of a girl. What I didn't get was that people can identify their gender as being non man/woman and that it wasn't just about expression. It wasn't the same thing as being a tomboy or butch or feminine. That didn't click until earlier this year, and now I feel extremely comfortable identifying as agender.
