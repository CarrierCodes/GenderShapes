2017-11-01 19:58:28,7a64vx,4,8,"I have been thinking about coming out for a loooong time, but I'm scared. My parents are not transphobes, but are not very well informed about the topic (and their education on non-binary stuff is 0). This is the translation of the email I might send in a near future (translated from Catalan, our language):

&gt; Dear family,
&gt; 
&gt; Today I'm writing to you to explain something that, for me, is very special and important. It's something so personal that I have re-written this email many times. I have never found the courage to say it in a face-to-face conversation. I guess I'll go straight to the point, which is the easiest way to explain difficult things.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm non-binary.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know if you expected that, I suppose not. In fact, you probably don't know what does that mean, so I'll explain it: ""non-binary"" (it's always used as an adjective) is a gender identity that describes those people who are not boys or girls. It does not refer to the sex (which is defined by the chromosomes) but to the gender. Maybe you suspected that I'm somewhere inside the LGBTI+ acronym (by the way, I'm also bisexual. But that's another thing!). I don't expect you to understand that immediately... it was difficult for me too!
&gt; 
&gt; This is not a new thing for me. I have already said in the beginning that I have been thinking how to tell you for a long time, how to ""come out"". You don't just wake up someday and decide to be non-binary. I don't know why I'm like this, but whatever reasons are there, that's how I am! I discovered the non-binary label approximately one year and a half ago, but I have older memories of me feeling some king of ""rejection"" towards the word ""boy"" when it was meant to represent me. And I asked to myself for a long time the famous question: ""Who am I""? For some time, I considered the possibility of being a trans girl, but I dismissed it. So, you know. Non-binary was what was left once I saw that I was neither a boy nor a girl.
&gt; 
&gt; The word ""non-binary"" falls under the ""transgender"" umbrella term, because a trans person is somebody with a gender identity that is differemt from the assigned gender at birth. Now that you read this word, you might want to ask me whether I plan on transtitioning, that is, undergoing all this hormones and sex reassignment surgery stuff. The answer is no. It's true that it would be cool to have a less masculine appearence (although not more feminine), but my current body is not *that* annoying.
&gt; 
&gt; I ask you a single thing: avoid all expressions that could imply that I'm a boy (or a girl) when you talk about me. This really annoys me. Try to use a neutral language. I don't have a problem with my current pronouns (""Ell"" is ok in Catalan. In English I prefer singular ""they"", though), but I'm talking about other expressions that include words such as boy, man, guy and similars. I know that it's difficult in a language like Catalan, where the grammatical gender is so important, but I will be very happy if you make the effort.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm sorry I've been hiding it all this time; I don't like hiding stuff from you. I'm kind of afraid of your reaction, specially when we meet again in person, because I have no idea about what could it be. I hope it's a good reaction.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, so that's the surprise of the week! Kisses and hugs for all of you :)

Essentially, a few months back she told me that she had been feeling ""pretty gay"" recently, and that she really wanted to have sex with a female friend of hers. A few months before that, she had given me permission to have sex with anyone (we were long distance, as i was away for school) as long as it was purely a physical relationship. I never took the offer out of fear of falling for anyone else.

Anyway, back to a few months ago when she wanted to have sex with said girl, I agreed pretty much because I felt if she never had this experience she would regret it forever, as we had been dating for nearly 3 years at that point. So, it happened and she was ecstatic and everything seemed good, until she told me ""I probably would have broken up with you if you had said no"". So..this took me by surprise. I was very hurt, and i ended up finding out (from her) that her relationship with said girl was different than what i had been led to believe, so much so that they were ""best friends"" without me knowing. Whatever, I was at school so i guess I wouldn't have noticed. But regardless, I asked her to stop having sex with her and she (begrudgingly) agreed. 

Now as for the nonbinary part, this was not revealed to me until about a month after, in which we were still having some tension over the other girl. According to her, this other girl was better at being supportive (I will absolutely admit to initially not being as supportive as i should have been, mostly out of shock and inexperience with being nonbinary as a concept, though I felt like I didn't really have much time to adjust or learn). On top of that, she still hangs out with this other girl all the time, as well, they're best friends. We argue and I, at first, give her an ultimatum: me or her. She couldn't really decide and I realized that maybe an ultimatum might not be the best thing to do, so i tell her to just stop talking about this girl to me, and don't have sex. They can be friends, but nothing else.

Well, that backfired (in hindsight, I should have taken her inability to answer as the answer). That argument happened in august. Fast forward to a few days ago, she comes crying to me on facetime and tells me they never stopped having sex. I'm devastated. But I ask her why, considering we had gotten to the point of genuinely talking about our future together, she did what she did instead of just breaking up with me. Her response was vague: ""You wouldn't understand...I'm trying to find things out for myself"". She told me how much she loves me and how I deserve someone better, whatever. She also tells me that her cheating on me has nothing to do with me doing something wrong or being unfulfilling, which I do not believe.

She was correct for one thing, however: I really don't understand. And that brings me here, because I genuinely want to know what goes through the mind of a someone who is nonbinary, and why such a thing like this would happen. I don't want to talk to my ex, simply due to the pain, but I am still very curious and a bit confused. She did mention that being with this other girl made her realize how much she hates her own breasts. Is being romantically involved with a different gender than your previous relationships help you in your journey in finding who you are? 

TL;DR Girlfriend comes out as nonbinary, cheats on me with a girl, then tells me i wouldnt understand why she did it. Want to know why, because it apparently had nothing to do with me.

By the way, I sincerely apologize if i said anything that might be either offensive or presumptuous, this is all very new to me.

I swear, if it wasn't made of goddamn broom bristles and it didn't have those damned bald spots, I'd try letting it grow and styling it because why the hell not, maybe I could get into it. But it's just too physically uncomfortable.

But evidently I'm not going to take drastic, expensive, potentially face-destroying measures for permanent removal *without even knowing what my face looks like without it.*

I'm starting to feel really tempted to grab my GF's epilator, go through the ordeal of ripping it off my face and finish it with tweezers. Not the first time I think about this either. But this sounds like an obviously horrible idea.

Do I have any alternatives? Is this off-topic?

Based on all of this, it seems like I should just be a trans guy, if being a trans guy is what I\'m comfortable with, but every time I say ""okay, I\'m just gonna be a trans guy then!"", it\'s only a few weeks or months before the thought that I\'m avoiding a part of my self comes back. I\'m not sure if I\'m just confused or internalizing something or what.\n\nHas anyone had any similar experiences?

So, my question is if here's any Spanish speakers (or Portuguese, French, or basically any Latin language) and how do you face the binary gender issue in our language? I'm a Spanish native speaker and I hate how gendered it is, most adjectives and nouns are gendered (in French even some verbs, like when you conjugate in past, like 'je suis allée'), and pronouns, all third person pronouns are gendered (él, ella, ellos, ellas). I'm not non-binary, but I hate always having to make those gender decisions when I speak, on one hand because I could be forcing a gender to someone and make them feel uncomfortable, and also because whenever I have to talk about a group of people I have to use male pronouns, adjectives and nouns, and I feel that I'm leaving out everyone who's non-male (as a woman, I've always felt left out when my teachers said 'todos' instead of 'todos y todas').
About this in Spanish I've seen 3 solutions:
1. Always use the male and female counterparts together, like 'todas y todos', 'compañeras y compañeros', but this does not include non-binary people, it's still gendered.
2. Avoid gendered words and use genderless ones instead, like saying 'estudiantes' instead of 'alumnos' which I try to do as much as I can, and that's the problem, you can't always find a genderless word for what you want to say.
3. When writing, use an 'x' or 'e' instead of the 'o' or 'a', like 'compañerxs', 'todes', etc. When speaking, you can't say 'compañerxs', but you can say 'compañeres', so it's pretty good, but it's still hard to do because our language is too binary (AND SEXIST) and it still doesn't solve the pronoun issue. I guess I could say 'elles' instead of 'ellos/ellas' (although I've actually never heard it, so I don't know if it's a thing), but what do I do when I have to use singular pronouns? What's the genderless version of 'él/ella'? I guess I could just use the person's name, but it bothers me that Spanish lacks genderless pronouns.

So, what are your thoughts on this? I really want to neutralize my language, and I'm trying to get rid of gender when I speak as much as I can, but I still have a lot of situations where I have no idea on how to do it, especially because I haven't seen so much discussion about this in Spanish as I've seen in English (and we really need to talk more about this!).",NonBinary,About genderless use of language in Latin languages,1510004684.0,"{'created_utc': 1509979484, 'id': '7b5jmh', 'num_comments': 21, 'score': 26, 'selftext': ""Hello!

(r/mtf post: https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/7bajhz/can_one_somewhat_feminize_genderneutralize_the/ )

TL;DR = (title of post) or: If I have to wear the standard 'male' formal color combo amid 'other men', across from some women wearing all black, is there some way i can retain (with my outfit) some subtle degree of my gender presentation without breaking the color pattern?



I am a male to feminine nonbinary person or ""demigirl"". I am still in the process of coming out to people, and in figuring out my presentation. I'm only like ~5-10% at most maybe so far into properly discovering my voice still. There are some obvious feminine things I do like paint my nails and wear make-up and women's sweaters etc, but at the moment I am basically read as male.


I'm doing music in school. Of my current 3 main teachers, I'm out to 1 of them, no, 2 now, as of today. 1 was my primary singing teacher. Number 2, today, was the teacher of a chamber choir I sing in.


So as I mentioned, I sing in a chamber choir, something like ~16 people. SATB (soprano alto tenor bass). We sing arranged in a horseshoe pattern arranged from lowest parts to highest parts. I'm in the tenor 2 section maybe 3 ""guys"" out from the middle, opposite the girls.. Anyway.


We have a performance coming up next week.


""Ladies, all black. Men, you know the drill. Black slacks, white shirt, black bowtie.""


I asked after class if I could wear all black. He said if I had a reason for it he'd hear me out. So I nervously came out to him and told him why. But I also considered the situation a bit, out loud, when talking with him. That the break in the color pattern could draw attention that I'm not necessarily seeking. That I imagined it probably wouldn't be possible to re-position me to the end of the tenors, in the middle, to avoid this visual pattern break (he confirmed this, I mustn't leave my designated position). But he was still willing to let me wear all black if I decided I wanted to, given my reason. Told me to think about it.


Upon starting to think about it, my mind went here:


Is there a way I can wear the same color pallette as the men surrounding me, but just sort of subtly make my outfit a bit more feminine? Maybe if there's a female equivalent of that outfit... Differently fitting pants and shirt, maybe some kinda black ribbony thing instead of a bowtie..? I don't know..


(I don't know how far I'd want to take it, but it did also just occur to me that I do also own a nice black skirt that goes past the knee. Maybe if I knew just what else to wear with that, that matches the guy color pallette..? Hmm, would black leggings make sense perhaps in that situation also to possibly reduce the ""distraction"" level? To be honest I have not yet really figured out how color combinations and everything works in girl mode fashion yet.. Maybe I'm just being extra careful.. I feel like the ""boymode"" or ""nonbinary"" outfits I randomly throw together everyday are very well color combo'd... I'm rambling...)

2017-11-10 19:15:52,7c3a17,1,3,"So, hi. I’m new here. Wanted a place to vent about stuff that’s been going on in my head recently, and was wondering if other people have ever felt the same. 

I’ve recently started to be more open about my nonbinary identity, and have started to accept it more and start to explore it a bit. I started feeling like I wasn’t cis about 6 years ago but mostly kept it to myself and felt very ashamed of it in that time, which I think is part of the reason I find it so hard to talk about now. 

I came out a few months ago to a select group of close friends, and to my partner. The support I received was amazing and I felt great, for the first time I actually felt validated and accepted. I also joined a lot of nonbinary facebook groups on a fake account so people I’m not out to yet didn’t see, and got talking to a lot of lovely strangers. 

The problem is, starting to accept myself and talk about my identity seems to have brought me a whole load of different problems from the ones I had when I was hiding it. Now I’ve started coming out, I just want to come out to everyone and start my transition, but 1) I don’t feel safe coming out to a lot of people, 2) my anxiety is preventing me from coming out to people I would feel safe with, 3) I’m feeling increasingly depressed that I can’t transition immediately/can’t transition in the way I want to. My dysphoria has got far worse, and I just keep thinking about how angry and miserable I am that my gender isn’t legally recognised. I live in the UK, and our government is currently discussing reforming the gender recognition act from 2004 to make it easier for binary trans people to legally change their genders, but there’s no mention of whether it will include changes for nonbinary people too. 

I don’t know if I want to go on hormones, I kinda want top surgery, I definitely 100% at least want a reduction, but the doctors will likely refuse to give me a reduction because of my weight so that’s another thing I have to wait for. I was thinking about asking to be referred to a gender identity clinic, but I’m not sure how much help it’d be when I’m unsure of what I want to do when it comes to transitioning, and also I’m scared my doctor would just laugh at me and tell me I’m not trans. Transitioning physically also concerns me because my boyfriend is cis and straight so I wonder how he’d feel about it, although he’s been really supportive so far. 

I’m also worried about how I’m ever going to come out to my family. I live with them at the moment and it’s difficult constantly being misgendered. My sister sort of knows that I’m not cis but she’s made her opinions on nonbinary people very clear (“stupid tumblr snowflakes wanting to feel special/following a trend” “they/them are grammatically incorrect pronouns” “you have a vagina so you’re female” etc etc). So she doesn’t use my pronouns or acknowledge me as nonbinary. My mum is worse, she constantly uses slurs when referring to trans people, she once refused to let me go stay at a friend’s house who was a trans girl because “I don’t want you getting involved in any weird tranny sex parties”. She also tends to take the attitude of “I’ll do what I want whether you like it or not”, I’ve asked her repeatedly to please call me Abi or the nickname my sister and brother call me instead of Abigail, but she refuses and still calls me Abigail. I was thinking about potentially coming out to my family after I move out, although I’m not sure when that’ll be. I’m 20 but can’t work at the moment because of my mental health issues, so don’t have the money to move out. 

I’m just kinda finding life in general really hard and really really wishing I could just be cis at the moment. I’ve thought about just trying to fake it like I used to and seeing if I can get by pretending to be a girl because it’d make life so much easier if I could. I’m angry and frustrated at the world and feel like I’m just helpless while people in positions of power debate whether I should legally be allowed to exist, while strangers laugh at my pronouns and identity, while my family talk about how trans people are attention seeking, confused or perverts. It just makes me want to isolate myself and never have to face another person again.

2017-11-11 06:07:06,7c6ty6,13,3,"Hello, I'm new here. I'm a AMAB transwoman, I started transitioning back in 2011, so it's been a long time. But lately, I've been noticing musings toward nonbinary thoughts and stuff, below is two tumblr posts I wrote, kinda stream of consciousness stuff. I would like anyone's thoughts on these musings, sorry it's so long and all over the place.

And I apologise if I've worded anything wrong or used the wrong terms or something, I've only ever heard any of the terms and notions in passing. So if I say something wrong I am sorry.


&gt; Last night I was reflecting on my admiration for non binary folk, particularly femme and trans femme non binarys. I came to realisation that maybe I'm not just jealous of their styles and presentations, I’m actually envious of their gender.
&gt;
&gt; Well that led to some self reflective soul searching. Am I non binary to some extent? I never came to any sort of answer. I do identify with female as a gender, which is pretty binary, but I also sometimes don’t? It’s not like I ever identify with male, or agender or something along those lines. But I read a brief questionnaire that asked if my gender fluctuated between different intensities whilst staying the same relative identity, and I’d never thought of it before but yeah it kinda does. That’s something like genderflux? So that would make me femme flux? Demigirl? Transfeminine flux? I dunno what even.
&gt; 
&gt; Gender is complicated. Or it isn’t. Gee I don’t know anything anymore.

.

&gt; Further to the non binary musings. I’ve also felt disappointed that I am binary (am I though?) and that I was letting someone down. I’ve never really vocalised that to anyone though, because binary identities are valid, and I’m not letting anyone down. But I still feel it.
&gt;
&gt; When filling out forms that ask for gender if there’s only male or female I will always, without hesitation, choose female. But if there’s a greater selection, like for example MtF, FtM, Male, Female, Non Binary. I will hesitate between choosing MtF or Female, like I don’t want to recognise my AMAB past, but Female isn’t completely accurate either. Or if they ask are you a man or a woman, I know I’m not a man, but I also hesitate on woman. How can I be female but not a woman?
&gt;
&gt; I have often brushed these thoughts aside, nah if I were non binary I’d know, I’d identify with the label more. I’d not feel female. I am binary I’d tell myself, feeling that disappointment at the back of mind. Like, I know, but what if…
&gt;
&gt; I mean, these are similar feelings I felt before transitioning, to convince myself not to. Not as strong or as well defined, but similar nonetheless.
&gt;
&gt; But what does it mean? There are so many labels and names and identities it’s confusing and I don’t find any particularly alluring. I wouldn’t even know where to begin if I were non binary.
&gt;
&gt; I’ve always celebrated non binary people and their identities and fought for their inclusion into trans communities, is it just because I feel that inclusion and diversity is superior to exclusion, or is there more?
&gt;
&gt; I’ve always known and celebrated that gender binary construct is an artifice of what is really a spectrum, probably not even a one dimensional spectrum (ie: sliding from one side to another) at that. So why do I feel, if I feel disappointment in being binary not allow myself the freedom of such a spectrum? Is it societal? Is it my own low self worth in play here, only allowing me so much freedom but no more?
&gt;
&gt; I still have more questions and than answers. I have no answers at all really.

2017-11-13 11:10:11,7cmf5s,10,10,"I'm 18 years old. Soon to be 19. 
I have been out as male for more than one year and have only started with the Gender Clinic. 
After being out as male I start to discover much more to my gender identity and who I am, what causes my dysphoria, what I'm able to handle, etc. 
Long story short, I have always wanted to have a child of my own. They've given me the option to freeze my eggs, but the procedure freaks me out I can't stomach it... I really can't... it leaves me lightheaded, and it just doesn't feel right anyone... well... I can't... 

I have done some research on fertility and hormones. Obviously I will never be able to tell how much of my fertility starting male hormones can affect, but I've heard of cases where people have taken themselves off T and have successfully resumed ovulation. 

I'm wanting to give it a go, because if it's possible then I would rather carry than freeze my eggs, which I really cannot bring myself to do as the thought causes me emotional distress. I can't even see a gynaecologist for the same reasons. I'm okay with my original plumbing and prefer it sexually. But the... checkups and surgeries... I can't do it. 

This aside. Is anyone with the NHS? Do the NHS supply you with hormones? If so, how will I be able to freely take myself off hormones temporarily to try and conceive without the NHS denying me treatment? I know they will, they only care about the money after all, but the idea of being unable to conceive will emotionally shatter me. 

Already I'm feeling suicidal thinking of this. The NHS and never being on hormones again all because I wanted to have a baby.. it f*cking hurts. I'm not sure if anyone here is wanting something similar, or is deciding to go off T for other personal reasons. Does anyone know what I could possibly do? What are my options? Is it possible to take myself off them over an agreement and be able to resume treatment when necessary? 

I don't want to force myself to stay on T and destroy my chances of being fertile enough to carry a child of my own. I was thinking of taking hormones until my voice deepens, my shoulders broaden and certain areas grow a little. Taking it long enough to separate myself from my biology. Hopefully resume ovulation and take supplements to support this. Clearly I'm going to need something in order to prevent vaginal atrophy. I've heard somewhere about being supplied with a small dose of E just to keep certain areas healthy?? 

You can tell me if I'm wrong. I'm not that bright and still have plenty to learn. I just hope this text post can be free from any negative judgement, just for today, because right now I feel like sh*t. Right now I'm feeling like sh*t and honestly my head is in a dark place. Normally I can handle constructive criticism, but right now... it's really hard, I can't even concentrate on my studies right now. Honestly, I can't concentrate on anything. 

Taking hormones, being with the NHS... I'm so scared of things going terribly. I don't want to lose the chance of carrying a child, and I don't want to be denied hormones afterwards as I might not be able to handle any further dysphoria. 

Yes, pregnancy. Most pregnancy is seen in females. Ha. My dad commented on this today. ""Pregnancy is a women's thing, why do you want to be pregnant!?"" 

Embarrassing, I know. Yet I'm not going to share this with the entire planet, am I. I've heard of plenty of AFAB people going through pregnancy, if there's a slim chance I am able to still conceive than I would rather take it than throw it away because some stupid NHS regulations. Check boxes. Etc. 

I'm in the nonbinary form as although I'm in the process of starting male hormones, I don't feel entirely like a binary male.

I hope someone can give me a little guidance... I seriously don't feel well... if you got anything horrid to say, tell me it later.. just not now.

2017-11-14 02:20:26,7csewj,7,3,"I have a question about how other genderqueer/non-binary folks handle online dating.

Both Tinder and OKCupid allow you to list your gender as something other than male or female. However, both still require you to decide if you'd rather be included in searches for men or women. I don't really understand why they can't have a third category for people who'd rather not be included as either of those, but whatever.

If you use those sites/apps, how do you decide if you'd rather show up in searches as a man or a woman? Do you go by your own comfort level/self-identification? Which gender you typically pass as? Your transition goals (if any)?

I feel like letting myself be listed as a woman is probably the lowest-pressure option right now. I'm AFAB and haven't transitioned except for coming out as non-binary. I'm undecided about medical transition. I like the idea of having a male body, but I don't really mind how my body is right now for the most part. But I do see myself as more of a guy than a woman, and when I try to navigate online dating, I'm very self-conscious about how people see me. I worry about people seeing my profile come up in a search for women and deciding that, regardless of what my profile says, I'm basically a woman. But calling myself a man feels like a lot of pressure when realistically, I know that most people who are looking for male partners probably won't find me attractive in that way.

2017-11-17 12:23:45,7dkjvs,0,9,"Hello there, I'm looking for relationship advice. I'm a trans feminine person, who isn't planning on transitioning, e.g. hormones or surgery. I'm looking into other minor, non-trans specific tweaks (laser, fillers), but that's that. I'm already presenting as female and I'm pretty comfortable with that.

I've been dating bi/pan guys mostly, 1-2 on the Kinsey scale. I've previously presented as male, and had one boyfriend during that period, and then had one other, while presenting female, and currently I have one. 

With my current boyfriend, we're in a long-distance relationship, he used to live in an other part of the country, now he's just moved to an other city in an other country. I helped him in getting a job, I also plan to move together with him later and it isn't further away than his previous town. We used to be together once a month for 2-5 days, now this could increase as he won't have his homophobic parents around, which prevented me from visiting him. This is my first relationship where we're both in love and I feel that I can have emotional intimacy with an other person.

He's dealing with depression and I'm dealing with anxiety, we're both taking medications for that. Unfortunately, his medications are decreasing his already lower sex drive, while mine is up to the skies - during our last meeting, which lasted 5 days, we had sex twice, both of the times when he initiated, but I was also initiating sex like 2 times a day besides that. We've had issues with me being pushy, he even said that he was afraid that something would ""break"" and I would try to ""coerce him"". He later clarified it was more of a fantasy for him, obviously under consensual terms. I haven't had issues like this with other boyfriends, my sex drive was way lower back then and also those weren't long-distance relationships, so we could meet up reasonably frequently. I fully take responsibility for my wrongs in this situations, obviously I understand where I have been wrong and I plan on actively changing it.

He's been asking about hormone therapy three times, whether I'm contemplating doing it. On the last occasion, I eventually made him admit that he's ""missing tits"". He later clarified, that I shouldn't take it too seriously and that he's in love with me, but obviously it triggered my disphoria and I can't really let go of the whole thing, it has been giving me massive anxiety for the last 3 days, up to the point where I can't properly function at work or in social settings. We've discussed it since then, but him reasserting that he loves me and won't leave me doesn't quite work. I don't know any other trans/non-binary people and obviously discussing it with my cis friends doesn't really work. We had issues with him constantly flirting with cis girls in a really creepy way online, which he actually worked on and managed to stop with. 

I'm afraid if I'm shutting down similar conversations I'm forcing him to be polite and not discuss important things, however discussing it freely will obviously deteriorate my mental health.

2017-11-19 12:52:32,7e0ei2,12,15,"I sometimes feel guilty about calling myself nonbinary (actually, ""genderless"" is the term I prefer) because I present so strongly as a ciswoman, and I don't insist upon having my pronouns (zhe/zir or they/them) honored outside of online trans communities. I am a bit drunk (can't seem to post these kind of topics while sober), so I apologize if this post is somewhat incoherent and rambly.

I was raised by parents who stoutly reject gender norms. I had both ""boy toys"" and ""girl toys"" growing up. For example, I was interested in both dressing up and taking apart computer keyboards as a child, and my parents encouraged both activities. 

My mother is very interested in redefining womanhood to fall outside gender stereotypes. Dad would like manhood to fall outside gender stereotypes as well, but he's more of an activist for redefining womanhood. I suspect he believes that once one gender has broken the norms, the other one will naturally follow. Neither of my parents fit gender norms at all, but they are both cis. They also both believe it is important for cis people to reject gender stereotypes as part of the overall goal of eliminating sexism and patriarchy. Growing up, I pretty much considered myself a non-typical girl. Any outside of gender norms activities I partook in were “see, girls can do this too.” But my identity as a girl was based on nothing more than my XX chromosomes. 

I remember looking forward to getting my period because that would be a mark of entering adulthood. When it finally came though, it felt wrong. I’m not sure how else to put that. I’m not sure if this is more of a dysphoria or a “lots of women hate their period” thing. 

When I was about 19, I first encountered the term (and concept) genderless. My immediate thought was “OMG, that’s me.” I was part of an asexuality website that asked users to list their pronouns. I put zhe/zir because my hyper-active grammatical brain couldn’t accept singular they. Seeing myself referred to as zhe/zir just felt right. On the other hand, seeing myself referred to as he/him online also feels right, but I know I’m not a transman. 

I’m not really interested in surgery or hormones to bring myself closer to the nonbinary region. I don’t want my boobs reduced because my hips are super-wide, and the two balance each other out pretty well. I don’t want to cut my hair short because my face looks better with long hair (and I like playing with my hair). I wear mostly women’s clothing because it fits my physique better. I curse my body for being hyper-feminine, but I make no attempt to change that. I’m not super interested in actively trying to change it either. 

Part of me suspects that my parents are both genderless/nonbinary as well. Within their time-period, they coped best by embracing the feminism movement with its ideals of breaking down gender norms and binaries. Should I do the same? 

Where is the line between a genderless person and a woman who is actively trying to reject the patriarchy every day of her/zir life?

2017-11-19 22:15:21,7e3z46,3,17,"Thank you to anyone reading. I'm wondering if others have thoughts or similarities on how I’m experiencing gender. I'm struggling with words and terms a bit and hope this is ok to ask for some help with. 

I’m attracted to the term “nonbinary” as I’m pretty sure I don’t think there is much distinction of value or meaning in “male” and “female” and this these are both inadequate, oversimplifying, and similar enough to be kind of irrelevant (for me).  I also reject the idea that gender always exists in relation  (inclusive, alternating, etc. ) to these two concepts. ""Genderqueer"" seems like it has angles of making sense here too. 

I was assigned male and birth and have always felt like that made enough sense. I've never felt female and despite debilitating body image challenges, have always felt like having an external appearance labeled male was close enough. 

I’m not feeling a need or interest in changing my body, etc. I'm in a relationship with another AMAB person for the past 20 years and usually identify as queer, but sometimes gay.

But in so many ways, I don’t recognize myself as  “male.” I don't feel connected to other men through a gender lens, don't feel at all like I am part of the conversation when people talk about men*, and have never been interested in gendered spaces or activities for men. I’ve rarely felt men see me as one of them either. This includes gay/queer men as well.  I’ve even noticed in my closest peer group that the “men” connect with each other and are referred to as “the guys,” etc. This never includes me. It’s just understood that this is not me. 

At this point – it’s like I look male, I have male-male seeming romantic and sexual relationships, but I’m otherwise not male internally. 

I remember bristling in childhood when a peer called me ""dude,"" couldn’t understand why boys and girls had different clothes, shirts on or off when swimming, and frequently have to remind myself that I am male when people are speaking about men. I don't feel comfortable being called ""sir.""  Many of the stories I read and a few of the folks I know have similar dissonance with these things, but I see them express a connection to or an identity reflecting “femaleness”. 

*I think one of the complicating factors is that I believe that male and female are political and social groupings and that my expression of maleness (especially my appearance)  has brought various unearned privileges including forms of safety, being listened to, employment privileges, and more.

Is this non-binary? A form of gender ambivalence?  Ami Just a a male that doesn’t relate to maleness on many levels?  

Thank you for any thoughts.

I have worn my hair long (for a boy/man) for nearly my entire life - not as a statement of my gender identity but because that's how I like my hair - and I was never really bothered when I was occasionally misgendered as a prepubescent/young teen. I would occasionally through middle and high school sketch myself as a girl, and sometimes used female avatars on forum websites. Even before I became more educated about gender and sexuality - and questioned my own - I always recognized that a part of me wanted to be more feminine (or something). 

When I got to college I was fortunate to have a very supportive social network that allowed me to experiment and I had a number of experiences that pushed me to question my sexuality and how I related to other people, discovering first that I am bisexual and then that I am polyamorous and - unsurprisingly - that I enjoy cross dressing, though not necessarily out of a sexual impulse but because I felt comfortable in clothes that are typically reserved for women. At every turn I felt comfortable and fulfillment in transgressing norms relating to gender and sex. 

I started reading about sex and gender through queer feminist theory and began to understand why I felt so claustrophobic in the masculine identity that had been pushed on me. I knew that I was not ""male"" but wasn't sure where that left me - agender, genderqueer, nonbinary, bigender - all of these felt more comfortable to me than being male, but where I fit exactly I wasn't quite sure. With no strong feelings one way or another I had a ""soft"" settle on being nonbinary. 

Presently I'm in a relationship with two wonderful partners, a woman that I'm engaged to whom I've been with for sixish years and an AFAB enby who has been part of our lives for the past year and a half. My interactions with my enby partner - as well as a few of my friends transitioning - has renewed my self reflection on my identity. Talking with them about their identity has made me feel more certain that I'm nonbinary, but as they have openly mused about transitioning to present more as such, I've been left uncertain of what to do. 

I guess ideally I would rather have a vagina though the idea of surgery is terrifying and something I prefer not to think about. In an ideal world I would have been born with one and would have come to my enby identity and would just take some T and change my dress to being more androgynous/butch. But that's not the world we live in. 

Transitioning feels so permanent and I'm not sure that I feel strongly enough about my gender identity and genitalia enough - in either way - to want to go through it. However, as I alluded to previously, I *really* dislike masculinity and the expectation that I perform it. 

Obviously everyone's gender identity is their own so nobody can tell me what I should do per se. I'm just feeling a bit more dysphoric than normal at the moment and I just wanted to get that all off my chest a little.

2017-11-28 06:56:43,7g2b4k,30,31,"This is mostly just to vent and get some emotional support, but I'll appreciate any advice anyone might have as well.

I'm AFAB and my birth name is EXTREMELY feminine. Fortunately, I've been going by a gender neutral nickname since I was 14. (I didn't accept my nonbinaryness until I was 23, so the fact that my nickname is gender neutral is a happy coincidence.) I use this nickname so commonly that I have dozens of friends who legitimately do not know what my legal first name is.

For most of the time I've had my Facebook, I've had my name set up as ""[First name] [Nickname] [Last name.]"" My family still calls me by my birth name, so this seemed like an easy way for both my friends and family to be able to find me. However, as time went on and I started going by my birth name less and less frequently, this started to bother me more and more, especially when Facebook would shorten it and refer to me by just my birth name rather than the full thing. I only use my birth name intentionally when I'm trying to be professional, (my nickname doesn't sound like a real name), so I've come to think of my nickname as who I really am and my birth name as more of a tool I use or an act I put on.

About 10 months ago, I publicly came out as genderqueer, and this seemed like as good of an excuse as any to no longer have to deal with seeing my birth name on social media. Not only did I feel super disconnected from it anyway, but also the hyper femininity of it was really dysphoria triggering, so being able to use my personal Facebook account as ""[Nickname] [Last name]"" was incredibly freeing. I still had ""[First name] [Last name]"" in parenthesis on my profile, labeled as my birth name, in case family or anyone else who met me before age 14 wanted to find me, but having my nickname as my first name around the rest of Facebook was a massive weight off my chest.

5 days ago, this all came crashing down. Facebook deactivated my account and demanded documentation to prove that [Nickname] [Last name] is in fact ""the name I use in every day life.""

The problem is, Facebook has a list of all the types of documentation they'll accept, and pretty much all of it is either stuff that I don't have (magazine subscription, membership card, etc.) or stuff that has my birth name on it (driver's license, birth certificate, etc.) I have TONS of stuff I've accumulated over the years with my nickname on it, and I've tried submitting some of it, but since none of it is on their list, they won't accept it. I also tried sending a message explaining the situation, but all I got was an obviously copy/pasted reply that didn't address my concerns at all.

I'm so fucking upset over this. More upset than I want to admit. I know it sounds dumb since it's just Facebook, but I've had that account since I was like 16 or 17 years old. I'm 26 now, so that's around a decade's worth of memories that I'm losing. I feel like someone confiscated my diary or scrapbook or something. Not to mention all of my friends whose phone numbers I don't have and Facebook is how we communicate, and I'm scared to death that I'm going to lose them. I'm also worried about my family hunting down my Twitter or Tumblr if they can't stalk me over Facebook, and I did NOT make those profiles safe for my family to look at.

My roommate is making matters worse too because she has the ability to help me fix it, but won't. We talked a few weeks ago about adding me to her CostCo account and getting me my own card, so I brought it up again knowing that I could probably have a CostCo card under my nickname and Facebook would probably accept it. However, not only does she completely not see my situation as a problem at all, but she also has severe social anxiety and wants to avoid big shopping centers like CostCo now that Christmas shopping season has started. I don't want to bring it up again and be that asshole who's dismissive of mental illness, especially over something that she doesn't even see as a problem, but I also am incredibly annoyed by the prospect of signing up for my own CostCo account because it seems so stupid to spend $60 basically just to get my Facebook profile back.

People keep telling me to just put in the documentation for my legal name and switch back to my nickname as soon as my account is reactivated, but I'm scared that Facebook won't let me switch again without more documentation, and I'd rather be without Facebook for a short time than get my dysphoria triggered every time I log on. I know this isn't Facebook's intention, but the way they're trying to force my birth name on me feels like they're trying to force womanhood on me, so this entire ordeal has had dysphoria kicking my ass enough as it is. And it's SO DAMN FRUSTRATING because I did in fact have my legal name on my profile, so it wasn't like I was trying to be sneaky and conceal my identity or whatever. I just don't want that super feminine name to be the one I have to look at EVERY SINGLE SECOND I'm using my primary social network!

I am pretty sure I have some type of gender dysmorphia...but only with my genitals.

This is my first post ever on reddit, so yeah, please don't be too rough with me (how do I again change these gray box-thingies (sometimes they read 'rant' and other stuff) on mobile?) ^^'
I've kind of felt disconnected from any gender for a few years now. I know that basing the following stuff on this might not correct, but anyway. I've stumbled upon the lovely term of 'non-binary' a few days ago, and it kind of feels like I've found an answer to a question that's been stuck inside of me for a long time. I've recently ordered binders and am already bursting with a kind of pleasant anticipation. 
Now, here comes the hard part: I've so far only told one person that I'm really close with that I identify as non-binary. I know that most the people I am surrounded with are rather narrow-minded and not really accepting/tolerant for that part (I'm ace for a long time, but my parents for example still kind of mock me ('You just haven't found the right girl', 'You've never had sex how would you know?!', you know, that stuff) and only like 3 people have no issues whatsoever with 'a guy' (notice the inverted commas) not being into having sex with anybody. 
So, this begs the question: Should I really come out to my environment as enby (I should probably choose a new nickname for that too [I really like Dakota], but how do I get people to actually use that correctly (/instead of my 'original name') since most of them don't accept me for the person I am?) or should I just wait until university to do that (and have a sort of a fresh start?)

I have no interest in HRT. I would kind of like a breast reduction, but not super urgent. What I really really want ASAP is a hysterectomy to alleviate my dysphoria that comes with menstruation. Does anyone know if a nonbinary person who doesn't want hormones could actually get approved for a hysterectomy covered by OHIP? The Schedule of Benefits document for OHIP coverage states that for a hysterectomy one must have ""completed twelve (12) continuous months of hormone therapy (unless hormones are contraindicated)"".
I'm not sure if contraindicated means someone who is medically unable to take the hormones, or someone who the doctor recommends don't need them, because well the patient doesn't want a beard and a deep voice...

Everyone who I've come out to has been extremely supportive and caring to me. Even people who I didn't expect to be supportive. I've been doing pretty well and have been feeling much happier about it, but as more time goes on I've begun to notice my dysphoria is just getting worse and worse.

At first I was happy with what I saw in the mirror. Now I look in the mirror and just see a man. I hate my face which is moderately masculine, I really hate my deep voice. My voice especially, I feel like it's what instantly gives me away. What's worse is that I switch into a deeper voice when I'm uncomfortable rather than my higher, happy voice. When I open my mouth, strangers give me kind of a shocked look because (at least I'm guessing) at first glance they may not think I'm a guy. Or maybe they do, that's what I see when I look in the mirror still.

I mean at least I'm able to hide my 5 o'clock shadow thanks to some excellent makeup, but I'm just struggling right now. I keep thinking what if I'm just a cis guy and all of this is a mistake? I still look like a guy apparently. Why even bother if I never am going to have a chance of passing anyway? Why put myself through all of the weird, uncomfortable looks and the silent judging? I just feel like I want to go back in the closet and stop even bothering with all of this.

And more and more I think about it I want HRT, but I know it isn't really an option for me. Unfortunately it has effects on one of the only parts of my body I enjoy and am happy with (my genitals, reduced use and size of them is something that I seriously do not want) and I don't really want my sex drive to change. So I'm just stuck trying to figure out whether I want to leave my genitals unaffected or if I want a better body and I can't choose because I want both. So I'm just stuck a dyshporic mess.

Does anyone have any advice they could give me? Like anything, on voice training, appearance, my HRT woes, or my dysphoria. I am just starting to really feel the struggle.

Lately I’ve been having periods in my transition where I have been questioning if “binary women” is actually who I am.

Another point that I’ve wondered about is had I been born in a AFAB body I question if I would have still ended up trans. I consider myself a lesbian and a somewhat butch and wonder if I would have still felt dissatisfied with my identity if somehow I could make that existence a reality.

Granted they were more feminine presenting and AFAB and I know that’s not everyone’s experience and I don’t have any real way to know how they identified but aesthetically something about not being a woman or a man and having an AFAB body just makes me frenzied thinking about. 

Does anyone else feel like this? Sorry this is very unfiltered and if I’ve said anything that is harmful or ignorant I mean no disrespect I just feel so lost about who I am right now.

One of my best memories from when I was little was one day when I was in a field trip. I was wearing a guy's shirt (I was born female) and I kept looking down at it. It was the best day of my life. If I had any brothers, I may have crossdressed. Muy childhood was pretty normal, but when I turned 8, things got a bit weird. something about my gender felt.. *off*. didn't feel female, but not quite male either. This still continues today. 

Things got a bit more odd when I got to middle school. I felt like my breasts were too large, and I would wear jackets everywhere. It could be 100 degrees outside, and I'd still wear a jacket. I found myself staring at the boys section in stores (and the guys at my school) and wishing I could wear them, and fantasize about how they would look uninterrupted by breasts (sorry if I sound a bit sexist). I loved the slim, straight waist and narrow hips. It became the subject of many fantasies. I began to look up stories where a female character either dresses as a guy or (agh, this is gonna sound weird) becomes a guy. 
The dysphoria didn't happen too often, but when it did it sucked. I would look at my breasts and feel physically sick.
 I got a haircut last year and that was a step forward. Not a buzzcut, just a kind of pixie cut (like Haruhi from OHSHC). 

A few days I looked in the mirror and my jacket kinda covered my chest and my hair looked kind of like a greaser's. My mood went up immediately. 

To this day, I still feel... slightly female, but mostly neutral, like an androgyne.
