2017-02-01 17:47:49,5rgxtw,1,2,"Hi folks! 

I'm currently writing this post as I feel that I am working through some things but would like some feedback on them. 

To give you some context, I have been questioning my gender (identity and expression) since September last year (2016). It first started with noticing how uncomfortable I was having a feminine gender expression. I forced myself to be somewhat high maintenance. This to me was wearing long weave, doing my nails, wearing makeup, dressing up etc.

Which was nice and sometimes I felt okay. But underneath it all, I had terrible self esteem. I was convinced I was huge in terms of size, felt really self conscious and didn't really see what people saw in me.  I was also diagnosed with body image distortions by a therapist (which I wonder at times if that was actually body dysphoria?).

So I realised how tired I was with how I presented, something was making me tired. I decided to make a decision to not conform to societal norms for women. Something I really advocate. But my questioning and conclusions didn't stop there. 

I dated someone recently, who was transgender. During that time I used to compare myself to them, was really curious about their transition. I watched and researched people who were transgender, thinking I was doing this to be a supportive cis friend. 

However, I subconsciously started to apply these ideas to myself. Would I live as male? Would I identify as male? Which my answer at the time was, ""well, yeah"". That night I concluded that I was a trans guy with little dysphoria. 

Since then, I have been having this constant internal conflict. There's not a day gone by that I don't think about my gender. Am I am a man or a woman. Am I comfortable being perceived as either or both? What kind of discomfort do I have gender wise, and in what ways etc. 

I have since presented more masculine, immediately my being self conscious has reduced somewhat. I now have a healthier relationship with my body, possibly because I contemplated taking testosterone (and still do sometimes). This forced me to contemplate my body a lot. 

I've been researching a lot of gender identities and think that non-binary transmasculine fits me. I feel that my gender identity is mostly neutral but also masculine. In that, I feel I identify as a person (agender) and a guy (male). I have thought about how my personality does not reflect my gender, neither does my gender expression. Despite behaving and dressing more masculine, it feels like something is still missing somehow. 

I constantly have doubts. Am I doing this for attention? Is my depression (which I am getting better with) causing me to want to reinvent myself somehow? Am I doing this to deal with the rejection of a break up for some crazy reason? 

I have these doubts even though I educated myself on the consequences of what this all means, how my life and relationships with people would change if I came out and if I am right about this. 

Any advice would be great, as you know, it is hard sometimes to work through something alone.

I've come across the term 'non binary' through research and this really feels like it fits how I feel and think about myself. However everything I've found suggests non binary and trans are the same thing, or are at least very closely related identities. I know I'm not trans, and I know I don't want to transition at all. the only thing I want to do is to start presenting more androgynously, but not inherently masculine (I kind of want to bind to achieve a smaller chest, and dress less feminine, but I don't want to be perceived as a man). I also like using the she/her pronouns and the female name I was given at birth, and think of myself as my partner's girlfriend, and don't want this to change, but I don't know if this makes wanting to look androgynous just a style/aesthetic thing.

So I've been out as nonbinary (AFAB) for a couple of years now and I still feel so disgusted with myself in so many ways.  My body disgusts me because I hate seeing and feeling the aspects that make me look physically female. So a part of me feels desperate to transition, but people keep saying that I should just do what cis people are encouraged to do and try to accept my body as it is.  And maybe they're right.  I just don't know and it's driving me crazy.  Like, actually crazy.  I have bipolar disorder and every time I start thinking about this stuff I start wanting to kill myself more than usual :/ .  I don't want to grow old feeling like this.

Sometimes I feel like I'm faking it or that I'm not trans enough, but this identity is in my head now and I don't think I can go back to being/wanting to be perceived as a girl.  I wish I could, to be honest.

Also whenever I start a new class at school or meet someone or going to the doctor or anything like that I have to decide whether to use my chosen name or my given name, and it always seems like I'm asking for a favor if I say my chosen name.  Except for close friends I don't tell people what my pronouns are mostly because I'm ashamed/afraid of being  ""needy"" or attention-seeking.

I've avoided talking to the trans people I know irl about this stuff because it seems like I'm supposed to celebrate and accept my identity. But I can't. At all. Basically I wish I'd never figured out that I was anything other than a cis woman.  But there's no going back.

I am an 18 year old male. I've always been comfortable being a male. I am by no means the stereotipical boy who likes playing football and cars but I still feel very comfortable being male.

I would like to be able to wear a dress and high heels like I like to wear a tie for example.
Very often when I was at home by myself (I don't live there anymore) I would go into my sister's room and dress up as a woman and it felt natural, just like it feels natural to be male. I would use socks to make the breasts, use a wig, put on a dress that would not show too much of my male body of course and high heels.

Also I spent hours watching videos of other boys transforming themselves into girls using makeup and other things.
Very often I would also dream about being a female in various occasions. I would also fantasize about it in my head.

I recently started talking to someone who is nonbinary and goes by he/his/they/them pronouns and I was wondering on how I should address them (although i expect this answer to vary somewhat)

When talking about them, is it considered rude to say him when their pronouns are him/them his/their?

I really don't know, just trying to make it so I don't fuck up talking to them.

An example of this would be like talking to a coworker and saying ""So i met this really nice guy, he's non-binary"" versus ""So I met this really nice person, they're non-binary"" when again, they want to go by he/his/them/their.

Often I feel that my female side is cis, and has nothing to do with being transgender. But my male side keeps kicking at me and saying ""yo, don't forget about me."" Every time I want to deny I'm anything but cis, I remember all those things that make me not cis. Sometimes I feel like it would simply be easier to pretend I'm completely cis, deny entirely to myself I have a male side, or to simply ignore it.

2017-02-15 21:34:01,5uag2b,6,8,"Hi friends, I think that I'm at the point in my life were I finally admitted to myself that I'm not cis, and theres no way I can live happily pretending to be. But I'm really struggling to figure how I want to identify, because it seems pretty essential to the whole ""coming out and living your dreams"" kinda deal. I'm AMAB and have really never connected with masculinity. Thats not to say that I didn't connect with my male friends, because I did have lots of cis male friends growing up many of whom are still good friends of mine. But masculinity as a whole has always seemed like something I don't want to inhabit, for instance I've had penetrative sex once, and I really didn't like filling that role. Currently my partner is the only one  who knows that I'm gender queer, I dress en femme with her quite frequently and sometimes we even go out and party when I'm dressed up, which always leads to an incredible night for both of us. I think at this point she thinks that I'm a trans woman, I'm not sure she's right, but I'm also definitely not sure she's wrong.

I don't have the worst body dysphoria, I think my issues with my gender is based more off of the way my body causes me to be perceived and therefore how I interact with the world as opposed to how it feels on my body. I've been thinking about coming out as non binary and using they/them/their pronouns, but I kind of want to reach the point where I'm perceived by strangers as female. I think that I still want to take hormones, but use they/them/their pronouns and identify as genderqueer. I've spent so much time and energy trying to end my subscription to masculinity, why would I immediately pick up another subscription?

Does anyone have any experience with this kind of identity? Maybe you thought you were trans at one point but identify as non-binary now or vice versa? Does anyone have any experience taking hormones without identifying as trans? Is it reasonably possible to be prescribed hormones without having horribly crippling body dysphoria?

- - -

For those who don't know, neurogenders are genders associated with neurodiversity. These include things like autgender (for autism), bordergender (for BPD), etc.

I noticed some neurogender ppl seem to treat their gender feels like they aren't real. This stems from ableism. Those ppl believe their gender feels are invalid because they're caused by their neurodivergence. This is like saying sensory overload is invalid because it's caused by autism, and ignoring what's actually causing the sensory overload.

If you identify with a neurogender, you shouldn't dismiss your gender feels. Your identity is just as valid as an NT's. Gender is something you feel, and what you feel is perfectly valid. You're allowed to change your life based on how you feel.

If you do decide to transition, please don't feel pressured into doing things you don't want to do. But please do the things you want to do. And remember, transition can be any combination of HRT, surgery, masc/fem clothes, etc, or even just one of those things.

Basically, I've had dysphoria since I hit puberty. But even before that, I was weird about gender. Reading trans stories, I never felt trans, but I wished I was because that would give me a reason to want to get rid of my boobs. I've never liked them, and for the last couple of years I've also wanted HRT. I actually learned of puberty blockers when I was like 15, but I never really asked my mum about them?? I was so depressed already, I think I just thought ""oh, she'd never agree"" then went back to my 24-7 brain fog (not to mention I was already pretty ""developed"" and felt it was too late).

Now I'm 19, and I live with my mum, who makes unintentionally hurtful comments but would never kick me out. I live in Australia, where transition is affordable for me. There's a good-sounding clinic that could be closer, but is reachable. But I'm just too scared to make an appointment? I wish I could just go there once, get a HRT prescription and be done with it. But it requires a GP referral, then several therapist appointments, then blood-work. The sooner I get it started, right? But to get it started I need to call the place, which terrifies me. I keep trying to tell myself it's my subconscious telling me not to transition, but I know it's not true. I'm autistic, I have severe social anxiety, I've had no friends since I was 12. It's the idea of calling.

But I feel like calling would be a mistake? There's all these tiny reasons that add up. Just when I reached 18, I finally liked wearing dresses and stuff (I'm afab). But I'd be too scared to wear them if I looked like a guy. I'm already hairy as fuck and don't want to be hairier, or bald (but I like all the other effects of HRT). I'll spend hours looking at binders online, then chicken out (""I've never bought anything online, and they take so long to ship anyway it's not worth it""). And since 18, I've hated my boobs slightly less. I think I may be genderfluid? Although I only feel like my assigned sex like once every few months, for half a day at best. Mostly I feel neither male or female. I think I'd be okay to pass as a guy, but paradoxically I don't want to bind, even though I want my boobs gone. As my mum's said, I'm a ""pretty girl"" but I'd be a short, ugly guy... which I wouldn't mind if I'm really trans, but what if I'm wrong?

Being trans is also embarrassing! I had the whole ""maybe I'm a trans boy"" convo with her when I was 15, she now knows I'm nonbinary, but I really can't discuss it with her because of the disgusted way she speaks of it. She thinks she's supportive, but her most supportive advice has been ""try dressing as a girl for a year, since you've never really tried being a girl, then try being a boy for a year!"". She's always there for me, but she is the opposite of what I need for trans matters. The idea of trying to talk to any family, or even a stranger who's a doctor is so embarrassing.

I constantly feel like I'm running out of time. I feel the days go by without me while I browse the internet mindlessly, ignoring my problems. I've always ignored problems rather than solved them. I leave work to the last minute. I take literal hours to get out of bed, even after I've woken up. I wish I had gone on HRT younger (all my immediate afab family are tall and big nosed! Not me!)

I'm autistic. My mum says I'm young for my age. When I was younger, I said repeatedly I didn't want to grow up - a fear of adulthood, or womanhood, or both??? I spent a year at uni, hoping I would feel like an adult and gain the self-knowledge to know if I truly am nonbinary. I joined clubs, didn't really talk to anyone, still feel like a child. The idea of all the paperwork of name changes and such exhausts me. I spend hours mindlessly browsing the internet about non-trans things. Then I spend hours reading other trans peoples' stories, or name lists, or binder websites.

I always leave schoolwork to the last minute, but the work stays on my mind constantly. Being trans feels the same way?

Sometimes--indeed, often--I have thoughts along these lines: What clothes would I want to wear if I was a girl? What would my sexuality and sexual preferences be if I was a girl? What surgeries would I want to get if I was a girl? What hairstyle would I want to have if I was a girl? What kinds/styles of makeup would I want to use if I was a girl? Et cetera.

However, in additional to all of these feelings, I also feel very comfortable being a guy; indeed, while I dislike some--indeed, perhaps many--aspects of my body and face (basically, I'd like to andrognize my body and face) as well as male social roles (for instance, I would face the risk of getting beaten up if I will wear a dress or a skirt), I also enjoy living as a guy and all of that--as well as enjoy using male pronouns.

Anyway, could I be gender-fluid? Specifically, are all of these feelings of mine an embodiment of gender-fluidity on my own part?

Or are all of these feelings simply a case of my (likely) dysautonomia--specifically with my brain playing some kind of trick on me?

2017-02-26 10:06:19,5w9i6k,2,5,"I'm sure there's plenty of topics on this but I felt like adding one. 

So firstly I identify as nonbinary currently, AFAB. Sometimes I've questioned if I'm just a trans man in denial. Sometimes I've questioned if I'm cis and confused. It's all so much fun.

One big thing with me is how my dysphoria(?) often changes. I know dysphoria isn't a constant thing with everyone, but the way it expresses itself in my mind changes so much and so extremely it's annoying. 

Many days I feel like I would be fine existing exactly the way I am so long as other people would identify me the way I wish to. Other days I look at myself in the mirror and feel like I'm wearing a costume. It's not a bad costume, it's not a costume I hate at all, but something about my body looks fake. 

I've never really gotten onboard with the whole idea of being a woman who's proud of her body. Thoughts tend to be more like ""this is an attractive body"" rather than ""MY body is beautiful"". Occasionally I cosplay as feminine characters with curvy bodies/big boobs, but my body parts always feel like another part of the costume for me to manipulate. Same when I wear dresses. 

I think sometimes about what I would want to look like under that ""costume"", but looking entirely like a man also doesn't seem right. I really don't know what would look right. Maybe a ken doll body? Or just nothing? 

I never have days where I'm just begging to cut these boobs off me. In fact I'd kinda hate to do that. It would feel like a waste personally. I'm fine with binding them on days when I feel like it. Most of my hurtful dysphoria is social. 

I know my situation is a little off, but I'm wondering about those who deal with dysphoria like this.
