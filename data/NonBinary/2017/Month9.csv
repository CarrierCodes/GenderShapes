2017-09-03 00:11:43,6xpyw7,4,7,"I feel very feminine. I am drawn to physical femininity too. If I see the face of a normal guy, I would never want to look like that, even if he is handsome. When I see very feminine looking cis men who could pass as girls I feel envious of their physical femininity. Same with certain girls. I feel envious of their face and posture.
I have always had a strange feeling towards my penis. In my imagination it is never there. I just don't like it. I don't terribly hate it. I even masturbate. I just don't want it to be touched and I would want to cover it up in a relationship. I intensely hate facial and body hair, dislike my rather manly shoulders and my large masc feet. I wish I would have girly little feet and narrow fem shoulders. I love having a feminine voice and feel very pleased when I'm gendered female on the phone. I would rather want soft facial features than sharp facial features.
I recognise everything trans people experience. It all clicks when I read what other trans people mentally went through.
I feel a strong urge to feminize my body and face.
On days that I feel masculine I want to puke. I hate feeling like a man. On days that I feel girly I'm relaxed and comfortable.
I have no desire to be with a man as a man. Not out of disguest or something like that, it just doesn't feel like me when I imagine my male face and body having sex with a man's body. In my sexual imagination I always imagine myself as a woman with a man.
I feel a strong envy towards trans women, not towards trans men. I feel envious that she gets to look like she looks.
I hate everything masculine because it doesn't feel like me. I love feminine things. Everything feminine.
There is a voice in my head that tells me that maybe I should just live as a feminine gay cis man. When I try to think about that it doesn't feel right because I would be with a partner who expects me to be a man and who would treat me like a man. A gay relationship doesn't appeal to me because that would mean that I still have to be a man in the relationship. There is a very girly gay guy who looks so feminine that I envy his appearence. There is one thing that I don't envy and that is his facial hair. Facial hair makes me depressed and grosses me out. He looks like a girl with short hair and I want his soft features and his tiny feminine body.
I want to be with a partner who treats me like a girl. When I think about pushing a button and being reborn as a woman I don't think I would push that button. I would want the body of that woman but not be viewed by society as a woman. I wish I could have a female body and enjoy male privilege. My desire to have the body of a female is not driven by a sexual force. In fact, I don't relate to crossdressers at all. I'm not aroused by being a woman and I am not focussed on women clothes. It's more a feeling of a woman's body matching with how I feel inside.
When I think about being a woman in society I hate being treated by men as weaker, I would hate not having a big career and I hate never being able to have the status men have. In a perfectly equal world I would push the button to become a woman in every aspect but not in this world.
I had counseling for more than a year and didn't come home any wiser.
From doing my own research I feel a strong connection to trans women living non-op and to very feminine gender non-conforming men with a feminine body, face and mind with almost no male characteristics in their appearence. The desire to have a feminine body and face is very strong and unexplainable. Picturing myself with a very male body makes me extremely depressed and angsty.
Picturing a situation where society sees me as a cis woman feels wrong. Picturing a situation where I can live as a woman while being seen by society as a transitioning individual that is not strictly male or strictly female but more in the middle feels exactly right.
I have this voice in my head telling me that I'm just an effeminate gay men with internalized homophobia. It doesn't ring true though. I experience intense gender dysphoria, hate being seen as male and hate looking male. It also wouldn't feel right if a man saw me as a man. I just don't want to be seen as a man by my partner.
I wish that it was possible to find a balance between male and female. Female body, gender neutral presentation and social status.
I don't know what my future will look like or if I will ever have a partner. I have thought about living as a gender non conforming man and while that could work on the short term it would give me more dysphoria once I will start becoming more manly and age like a man. The route of a fully transitioned post-op trans woman doesn't appeal either. I want to be a person with a feminine body who is not strictly male or female. I just don't know how I can accomplish that.
The route of a non-op trans woman minus her binary gender expression sounds more or less right.
Sometimes I wonder if there are other people like me on the trans spectrum. Who deal with transgender feelings, sometimes think that they are just really gay despite knowing that a complete life in their birth gender doesn't feel right either and who don't want to restrict themselves to just male or female but want to live in the middle and have a body with equal amounts of sex characteristics of both male and female.

So I'm definitely trans and proud, no doubt about that. :) But I'm really lost as to whether I'm binary or non-binary, probably because I'm struggling to figure out exactly what it means to be either binary or non-binary.

A little bit about me: I'm AMAB and pre-everything, but when everything's said and done, I definitely want to be perceived as female. No doubt about that. But I don't know what it ""feels like"" to be male, female, or anything else. While I've pretty much always wished that I had been born a girl, I wouldn't necessarily say that I ""feel like a girl."" It's just that I'm incredibly uncomfortable being perceived as and treated like a guy. And while I would be so much happier if I had been assigned female at birth, I'm not sure if I'd be *totally* comfortable with that assignment, either. It's like the difference between a pair of shoes that's five sizes too small versus a pair that's one size too big. One's definitely more comfortable than the other, but that doesn't make it a perfect fit. And maybe I'll ""grow into these new shoes"" after I officially come out to everyone. Or change my wardrobe. Or change my name and/or pronouns. Or start HRT. Maybe it's just a matter of time before I realize that I'm a binary trans woman. But it may also be just a matter of time before I realize that I'm a femme non-binary person. I'm honestly not sure.

I also wonder if I'm hesitating to call myself a trans woman due to some form of internalized gatekeeping. The way I've explain it to some of my friends, calling myself a woman and using she/her pronouns feels a bit like calling myself a dancer; I'm definitely not ""not a dancer"" (because I do love to dance), but I certainly don't have the years of training and experience that seems to be the prerequisite for calling oneself a dancer. And I know that trans people are the gender they say they are and have every right to refer to themselves as such! But while I believe that wholeheartedly when it comes to other trans people, it's a lot harder to accept that truth for myself. (Or maybe I hesitate to call myself a trans woman because I'm not?

2017-09-06 04:34:55,6ydgx7,6,7,"Hey everyone.

I'm 20 years old, AMAB. For a few years now I've had some vague confusion relating to my gender identity. I'm pretty sure that I'm not a full-on trans girl, I don't (think) I experience dysphoria, although I know that it's possible to be one without it, and I am usually happy to present masculinely, even sometimes want to be more masculine. I don't think that's about fulfilling a societal expectation so much as just liking the idea of being big/strong/""manly"".

That being said I also sometimes (keyword sometimes) want to be a girl, basically. Cute, small, pretty. Of course it's possible to be those things while identifying as male but I think this goes a little beyond that. Like sometimes I'll see a woman on the street and kind of envy her, or want to have her body, whatever. I have no idea where that comes from. But again, sometimes I'll see a guy and ""wish"" I looked like him. It's a bit different, not envy usually so much as really liking/wanting to emulate a style or something, but I think that's mostly because I already have a male body.

This kind of extends into sex and relationships, too. I'm bi, or at least identifying that way. Sometimes, I'm a girl in my fantasies (it may or may not be worth noting these fantasies specifically usually have a bdsm element, where I'm the sub) but in others I'm basically who I am right now (and usually am the dom when it gets kinky). Obviously there's some patriarchy reflected in the kinky stuff, but I don't think that's at the root of my desires.

I seem to like being masculine when I'm involved with women and being feminine around guys. That's probably an internalization of some kind of straight cultural ideal, but it's the way it is. I dated this guy for a while, and sort of experimented with playing up my feminine side around him, (like I shaved my legs and wore women's t-shirts), and while I kind of enjoyed that, I wouldn't really want to do it around girls. I find myself most emotionally comfortable around girls as well. The only people I've ever really been in love with were women, and most of my friends are as well. Dunno whether that means anything.

Basically, what do you all think? I'd appreciate advice from any perspective. I'm not cis-cis, at least I don't think, but I'm also pretty sure transitioning to female isn't what I should do. (Plus, I'm lucky enough to be a reasonably good-looking guy by conventional standards, but I don't think I'd make a very pretty girl. I like feeling attractive and don't want to stop!)

For a few years now I\'ve had some vague confusion relating to my gender identity. I\'m pretty sure that I\'m not a full-on trans girl, I don\'t (think) I experience dysphoria, although I know that it\'s possible to be one without it, and I am usually happy to present masculinely, even sometimes want to be more masculine. I don\'t think that\'s about fulfilling a societal expectation so much as just liking the idea of being big/strong/""manly"".\n\nThat being said I also sometimes (keyword sometimes) want to be a girl, basically. Cute, small, pretty. Of course it\'s possible to be those things while identifying as male but I think this goes a little beyond that. Like sometimes I\'ll see a woman on the street and kind of envy her, or want to have her body, whatever. I have no idea where that comes from. But again, sometimes I\'ll see a guy and ""wish"" I looked like him. It\'s a bit different, not envy usually so much as really liking/wanting to emulate a style or something, but I think that\'s mostly because I already have a male body.\n\nThis kind of extends into sex and relationships, too. I\'m bi, or at least identifying that way. Sometimes, I\'m a girl in my fantasies (it may or may not be worth noting these fantasies specifically usually have a bdsm element, where I\'m the sub) but in others I\'m basically who I am right now (and usually am the dom when it gets kinky). Obviously there\'s some patriarchy reflected in the kinky stuff, but I don\'t think that\'s at the root of my desires.\n\nI seem to like being masculine when I\'m involved with women and being feminine around guys. That\'s probably an internalization of some kind of straight cultural ideal, but it\'s the way it is. I dated this guy for a while, and sort of experimented with playing up my feminine side around him, (like I shaved my legs and wore women\'s t-shirts), and while I kind of enjoyed that, I wouldn\'t really want to do it around girls. I find myself most emotionally comfortable around girls as well. The only people I\'ve ever really been in love with were women, and most of my friends are as well. Dunno whether that means anything.\n\nBasically, what do you all think? I\'d appreciate advice from any perspective. I\'m not cis-cis, at least I don\'t think, but I\'m also pretty sure transitioning to female isn\'t what I should do. (Plus, I\'m lucky enough to be a reasonably good-looking guy by conventional standards, but I don\'t think I\'d make a very pretty girl. I like feeling attractive and don\'t want to stop!)\n\nIt feels pretty good to gather my thoughts and feelings and write them out, too, never done this before.

2017-09-12 01:58:17,6zk01c,2,2,"I had an interesting moment with a friend. We were are CVS so I could pick up my birth control pills, which I had gotten the prescription for earlier this afternoon. I set the appointment last Friday. I decided to stop my period less than a week ago. I've wanted to not bleed for a long time, but last week something flipped in my brain.

I could actually do this.

I've had that happen a lot lately. I wanted to cut my hair, so I did. I wanted to bind, so I did. And now, I don't want periods, so I won't have them. It seems so simple to me in hindsight, but for years I said to myself *someday.* And I realized that either *someday* was today, or it never would be.

But my friend and I talked while we waited, and she said something like *Don't rush this and do something you'll regret or hurt yourself.* I had been talking about my (way way in the future) plans like sterilization or an IUD and chest surgery or low dose T. I only came out to her last week, and I told her I came out to my mom this weekend. I tried having a conversation about what I want with my mom two days after coming out to her, but she wasn't really receptive.

It's hard for me to remember that this is new and startling to people. I've been thinking about this for weeks, months, years. But this is brand spanking new to my friends and family.

I guess I don't have a question. Mostly just curious, what time frame am I working on? For so long, anxiety and depression kept me from doing anything with long term consequences (like research careers or cut my hair super short), but now that I'm taking charge of my life, it's intoxication.

I always have been and still am attracted to women exclusively and I recently came out as demisexual, but there's another thing I've been struggling with my entire life - I even remember struggling with it as a 4 or 5 year old.  When most people recall memories, they can easily see themselves in the memory.  They see their body with their face.  I don't, and I never have.  When I think back to old memories whether they're from yesterday or 20 years ago, I do not see myself.  In place of where I should be in my memories, I see a woman.  It's always a different one.  It could be a woman I know in my waking life or it could be a cartoon character.  The only constant is that the woman is always very attractive.  Even when I play video games, namely Mass Effect, I feel so much more at ease doing a playthrough as the female character and find myself resonating with them often.

I've always resonated with strong female characters.  To this day, I couldn't care less about the male characters and I always see myself in the strong female characters, especially if they're disciplined and independent.

Being called a man does not feel wrong, but it feels like there's something missing.  Being called a woman feels slightly better, but there's also still just something missing.  I have no preference whatsoever for pronouns, but I go with masculine ones since that's what I've always gone by.

I've been confused about this my entire life.  Even as a kid, I didn't understand what these feelings were.  I was always so confused watching Pokemon as a kid and just feeling more in tune with Misty or Officer Jenny (both strong, independent, female characters).

I came out to my friends as nonbinary way back in April and it went well, they (almost) all use my pronouns and all that. But I've started experiencing a little bit of dysphoria around my name, Hazel. It's not a *really* feminine name, but it is almost always associated with women. 

My friends tend to call me Haze, or Haz which I appreciate since they sound a bit more gender neutral, but I don't think they would do as a legal name.

That said, I do have some attachment to my birthname.

2017-09-15 21:03:54,70cqzr,4,7,"hello, so im sadly not familiar with all the terms so please forgive me. i have some questions about maybe what I feel about myself. 

so as a child i was an EXTREME ""tom boy"" I wanted nothing to do with being a girl and all my friends were boys. I remember I would pray to god in the bathroom all the time that he'd change me into a boy.  In the 4th grade, PE was split up into boys and girls, and I was traumatized... I wanted to be with the boys, not the girls. I was forced to be with the girls, and the girls would ask me ""arent you a boy"" I was so pissed, that i was with the girls that I would fake being sick every time there was PE so I didnt have to go... And id ball my eyes out cause I hated it so much. 

from then on I dressed ""masculine"" up until high school, then I started dressing more feminine, just cause of society, what I saw on tv, whatever. I was comfortable dressing that way, but never acted fem, didn't ever wear make up, hated dresses but wore them occasionally. Ive hated dresses since birth. 

Sophomore year I figured out my sexuality and had my first girlfriend. now i label myself gay/lesbian. and I am fully accepting of that. 

some occurrences have happened where I feel like a ""man"" or not a woman per say... me and my girlfriend were talking about having kids, and everytime I think about carrying I feel sick like thats not supposed to happen to me, I usually refer to myself as being the ""dad"" jokingly. and say I need to go to ""daddy school"" to learn what to do with children. but i do feel that way like, im in a mans shoes in that situation. 

Im happy being a woman, Im happy with the way I look, I do not want to transition. But Ive always said I wouldn't mind doing it.  (open to it)

I still hate everything to do with being split up sex wise and it makes me feel uncomfortable. I do not like being categorized with other females. I definitely relate to men more, and they get along with me, almost like I really am not a girl. i do act/ portray more masculine. But I have a very fem face, and sometimes I do like my hail nails and make up done, and dressing fem. 

this is the most thought Ive ever put into this, so I just want to know if maybe im something different.

I didn't really know where else to put this. I have more or less settled on the conclusion that I like both boys and girls and perhaps some transfeminine identities that fall in between.

I like boys, but I feel like being the masculine one with them. You can read most of it on the r/rolereversal subreddit. The thought of being the femme one in a relationship with a guy just makes no sense to me, either we're neutral vessels of egalitarianism or, in fact, I really really like boys with an obvious feminine side to them, too. I feel pretty inadequate and weak and girly compared to most guys, so I generally tend to avoid them and any romantic relations there, because it's all so heavily gender-role-coloured and I can't handle that. I want it either eradicated or slightly reversed.

I like girls, but I have stupid, stupid standards both when it comes to myself and potential partners. Chub, hairs, farts, the whole *oh my god, we're gross sacks of flesh that have human characteristics* aspect just completely fucks me over when it comes to girls. When I think about being with another girl, that's the only situation where I want to feel femininely beautiful and sexy. But it comes with a set of super fucked up standards, and I don't meet mine, but I can't really get around them, either, so I've just given up for a while.

I'm 20 soonish and still finding myself. Obtaining some constant sense of self in regards of my sexuality and gender expression is fucking impossible though. The situation is kind of schizophrenic and every time I remember that issue (I drink, lift and study to forget. Drinking has the opposite effect, so I'm slowly giving the weekend celebrations up) I think myself to a headache.

Both of these ways of being and expressing myself are exclusive to the completely inappropriate genders, the thought of having it any other way just grosses me out though. I feel as if... those dynamics are essential to me. Besides the fucked up high standards when it comes to girls, all the aspects of wanting to be masculine or feminine or yearning to be loved and appreciated in a certain way have brought me joy. But I can't really be both. So it feels as if I have to... choose or decide something. It wouldn't be that way if I could just imagine myself as I am, with both guys and girls. But I can't. I could never present, act, express myself in a butch manner with another girl. And I could never throw myself at a guy while not expecting to be appreciated for strength, courage, musculature, confidence and a somewhat boyish aura.

It's driving me fucking insane whenever it enters my mind. I try to not think about it, but when you get lonely, you start thinking about what kind of people you like anyway, and oh no, there it goes again, the same old circular, fucked up argument with self.

2017-09-17 17:26:27,70ouyz,3,5,"Hey all,

I've been thinking a lot about my gender expression and how I've never felt quite 100% in my camp. For info, I'm a queer identifying AMAB and typically wear clothing and present myself male. In terms of my masculinity, I see myself as ""just a guy"" usually. The thing that's bothering me is I don't seem to be engaged in any sense of style (band t-shirts and jeans, woo), and while I'm now at the age where I should be dressing a bit more dapper/professional/less-slobby (30's), I feel like I'm being an impostor.I enjoy being a man and don't envision myself as a woman or transitioning, I just wish I wasn't ALWAYS presenting typical male.

In addition to this, I've noticed that my self-confidence has taken a hit lately. Much harder to make the most out of the day and it really takes effort to work on personal hygiene, though I generally feel great when I clean myself up. I just don't feel like my gender expression has ever really been *mine*. 

I live with my partner (f) and have hinted in times of distress that I don't feel great presenting as a typical ""man"". Her way of supporting me is letting me wear her earrings every now and then, which makes me feel great. I don't envision that I'd want to change too much about myself, maybe dye my hair a wacky colour, wear more effeminate earrings and nail polish maybe? I have a decent beard that I'm rather fond of. It's all very confusing.

I've been racking my brain trying to figure this out for a while. My biggest concerns are that I'm trying to enter the freelance professional world and I'm just not sure whether this is just fantasy.

For info, I\'m a queer identifying AMAB and typically wear clothing and present myself male. In terms of my masculinity, I see myself as ""just a guy"" usually. The thing that\'s bothering me is I don\'t seem to be engaged in any sense of style (band t-shirts and jeans, woo), and while I\'m now at the age where I should be dressing a bit more dapper/professional/less-slobby (30\'s), I feel like I\'m being an impostor.I enjoy being a man and don\'t envision myself as a woman or transitioning, I just wish I wasn\'t ALWAYS presenting typical male.\n\nIn addition to this, I\'ve noticed that my self-confidence has taken a hit lately. Much harder to make the most out of the day and it really takes effort to work on personal hygiene, though I generally feel great when I clean myself up. I just don\'t feel like my gender expression has ever really been *mine*. \n\nI live with my partner (f) and have hinted in times of distress that I don\'t feel great presenting as a typical ""man"". Her way of supporting me is letting me wear her earrings every now and then, which makes me feel great.

I know I want fat redistribution -- I want to be shaped like a man, but like a skinny man, and I wonder if I could get my desired shape sans hormones. I don't think I'm motivated to exercise &amp; diet hard enough for it though... I'm not overweight, just ~10-15 pounds over what I think would look better as a man. I do like my current femme shape, but just...not for me, yknow? 

I also like that my face is getting more masculine, but I think I look cuter as a girl, and I miss what I looked like with a girly hair cut :( Most of the time I prefer my boy cut, but sometimes I want a bob again. I can't see it looking good as a dude though...

I have mixed feelings about my voice changing -- I get very excited by the idea of having a low voice, but I also don't feel strong dysphoria about my voice now. I like how I sound! At the moment my range is getting wider &amp; my voice hasn't cracked.

I absolutely hate body hair, and it was only in recent years that my hair has gotten lighter and I've become less obsessed over it. Already my leg hair is growing in more thick, I shave it but I can tell there's more there, and it bothers me. I'm really nervous about facial hair, I don't want it but I also don't want to immediately laser it, in case I change my mind and want a beard later. 

I'm fine with the bottom growth so far, it's been pretty subtle, and the more that changes the more I wish I had a dick (I don't particularly want phallo at this point in time though). And I never stop hating my boobs, top surgery is 100% in my future. 

Most days I feel more masc than femme, but on femme days I hate how I look with my short hair &amp; skirts, I look way more butch than I want to. I'm scared that becoming more masculine will suddenly cause me dysphoria on femme days. I don't want to stop T, I was even supposed to up the dose next week, I just....am feeling nervous I guess.

2017-09-25 05:39:42,72ahgs,3,6,"Hi friends, 
I guess I'm having some issues right now, mainly about my gender expression. I came to realization that I was non binary over the course of about two years. It was long and arduous but I have known solidly for about a year now that I am not cis, but agender. I have never felt a connection to any gender I have been presented with, and when I do feel a connection to something gender-related, it is a single aspect of a gender, not the gender as a whole.

So the way I dress changes wildly. I sometimes wear skirts, I sometimes wear slacks and a button up. Usually I dress pretty androgynously (think a short sleeved shirts and black jeans), but there is a noticeable shift sometimes, and I can't exactly explain why the shift happens. Some days I just want to wear a skirt, but other days I want to wear more masculine clothes. 

I always refer to myself gender-neutrally in my head, no matter how I dress, and I'm always most comfortable with they/them pronouns. I guess sometimes I just feel invalidated by dressing one way or another. Has anyone gone through this? Any advice on how to change those feelings or handle them? I guess I'm confused, I always thought agender fit but maybe it doesn't if I feel such a strong desire to present in these different ways? 
I appreciate any and all perspectives on this, I know no one can tell me what I am, but maybe hearing other stories could be helpful.

I had this huge range of things, from cis man to transgender woman, and after two years of careful thought, a couple breakdowns, nerve-wracking trips to the women's section, and now after 6 months of HRT, I have narrowed it down to: Not male.

Now, I'm not hyperfocused on labels, (I'm hardly focused on anything right now due to this Monster I'm drinking, but I digress), but it would be nice to shrink the possible area down to something that I can say with confidence beyond Some Sort of Trans^TM\.

I *could* see a therapist, but I'd much rather talk to someone on my and their own time if I can.  If anyone is willing to reach out and has some experience in questioning, or has had a similar experience of identifying as cis-&gt;genderfluid-&gt;transfemale-&gt;agender-&gt;genderflux-&gt;transfeminine-&gt;fuckall, replies or PM's would be appreciated.

My whole life I've had very bad self esteem surrounding my body. I remember that the first time I got my period, I was extremely upset. I felt that it was wrong and it shouldn't be happening to me.

I didn't question that I was a girl. I was born a girl therefore I was a girl... I didn't know what trans was until high school, but that didn't really seem right either. 

I've enjoyed the androgynous look since I learned what it was. I wanted to look like that, and still do, but I also like the feminine look.

2017-09-27 17:50:34,72tzmp,5,1,"I'm sorry if this isn't the right place to put this.

Hello everyone! I'm a 25 year old AMAB and pretty much am 100% sure I'm not cisgender at this point; however, for the past year and after 2 counselors, I'm still questioning where on the trans spectrum I may be, and my previous interactions with trans community haven't gone well. After lurking here for about year, I figured I would run it by you fine people and any insight you could provide.

Background: 

Looking back now, there were signs that I was trans even when I was young: primarily being jealous of my sister's Barbies (they got me a Ken doll instead; although I did still love action figures--which are basically the same as dolls) and when we created our own Transmorgifier from Calvin &amp; Hobbes, I used it to make myself Brittany Spears. It wasn't until 5th grade that I actually became interested in women's clothes, after I noticed a girl in our class developed breasts and became fascinated by this: most of my early fantasies involved growing breasts or trading body parts, and that pretty much set the tone for most of my fantasies since. I started crossdressing and looking up trans and women's underwear online; I was caught a few times, and I would deny everything and passing it off as simple curiosity.

However, despite all this, I liked being a boy: hell, I like how I look with my goatee, which I dreamed for years of growing--I didn't like most of the boys in my classes and could relate to girls easier partially because I matured faster, but I never disliked myself for being a boy and I am comfortable being referred to as a man--I'm equally comfortable being called a woman, though if I were honest, I do feel satisfied when people call me a woman, but that may be because I've only just started considering myself a woman and it feels validating.

I have reached the point where I'm comfortable shopping for women clothes and heels (for the most part, and it was weird to see a pair of heels and desire them just because :)) and using female pronouns, and I will admit that once I put on thigh-highs and heels, I felt sexy--but at the same time, I'm okay with either smooth or hairy legs and I like my facial hair and my genitals (even if I think dicks are kind of ugly XD).

Ultimately, I just wind up feeling like a man and woman simultaneously and feel just as comfortable with fake breasts on and off, if that makes sense.

TLDR: basically, given my history, I know I'm trans, but since I like both my male and female selves, I'm not sure if I should consider transitioning or not: my ideal would be to magically be able to switch whenever I wanted, but I'm not sure if it's because being male is what I'm used to or which one I'd want to present as primarily.

2017-09-28 04:38:44,72xvuq,11,8,"Hi everyone!

I'm kind of in the weird position that when I come out to people, I don't really know what to come out as. I feel like I can't really say I'm ftm, because I don't identify 100% as a man, but I can't say I'm nonbinary either, because I identify too much as a guy for that (and 0% as a woman) in my opinion. I am kind of sure of my 'spot' on the gender spectrum by the way, but I don't really feel like explaining all of that to everyone all the time. 

So basically, if I have to 'choose' between man and woman, I would definitely say I'm a man. When I have to choose between man, woman and non-binary, I'm stuck between man and non-binary (this was really difficult when I signed up for Quidditch, lol). When I have to pick a spot on a spectrum I know it's somewhere around 50% a guy and 50% nothing. 

Sometimes I do think there's something withholding me from identifying as ftm, namely that I feel like I'm not 'manly' enough for saying I'm a man. Vice versa, when I say I'm non-binary, I feel like people are not going to take me seriously, or think partly of me as a woman.

I do have some solutions for this. When coming out to people, I usually say I don't feel like a woman, and more like a man. Or I just say I'm trans. In both cases most people probably assume I'm ftm, but I don't really mind that. 

I'm aware of labels that kind of describe me, like transmasculine non-binary and demiboy, but if I come out as one of those, I'll have to do a lot of explaining. 

So basically this isn't the biggest problem in the world, but I wondered if there are more people in the same position. If so, how do you handle all of this?
