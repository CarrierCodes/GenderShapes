No it's not that I'm masculine—I'm **not.** I am *so* far from masculine and I can tell you that right now; I'm 4'11"", 85lb, and I actually really hate the thought of being beefy or hairy or square or you know *traditionally masculine in pretty much any sense.*
It's more a leaning towards, I guess, being a feminine boy. Like those scene boys from 2007, you feel? Take away the ""rawr lol xD"" part and I shamelessly wish I looked just a *bit* more like them.
But of course there's a certain inherent genderqueerness in that that makes me not a ""full"" boy.

Then there's the body dysphoria. Frankly, right now, its the most present kind of dysphoria I have and it won't go away. As for my breasts I'm torn between keeping them and working towards a mastectomy but I'm not sure; I already bind pretty much all the time so it's not like there's much of a point in keeping them, but sometimes I still want to keep them and I'm not sure if it's real or if I just like how they look or something else /shrug emoji
Theeen there's the bottom dysphoria and that is *much* stronger. I want a dick, and its really as plain and simple as that. Out of this whole mess of confusion I've been dealing with for a year, if there's one thing I can wholeheartedly take from it it is that *goddamn I wish I had a dick.* A lot of the time I pack and honestly its a little embarrassing to admit I like to shove a sock down my pants but for me it's pretty helpful. That and pretty much whenever I think about having any kind of sex with anyone, like ya do, I imagine myself with a dick almost all the time.

Don't get me wrong though, I'm not a boy. In terms of my *body* I might have leanings towards something more male, but in every other aspect I'm pretty much entirely androgynous.
What I want to know if I should try going on T. Maybe not now, maybe not for a long time, but if I'm going to do it eventually I might as well start working towards it now (especially since my country supposedly might have just taken away my healthcare what up lmao)

2017-01-02 01:41:49,5likot,7,4,"Hi all! I am 32 years old and recently have started questioning my gender identity. I'm a little old to be questioning things now but whatever, it's happening. I was born female and always liked more ""boy"" things growing up. I liked more gender neutral clothing and liked to keep my hair short. When I was in middle school I got asked a lot if I was a boy or a girl and I started feeling ashamed. I kind of just accepted I was a girl and tried my best to conform to femininity. I was never very good at it though. I always had my best girl friends dress me up and put makeup on me. I never liked any of that but I did it to fit in. 

As far as my sexuality, I would be into girls when I was growing up but always called it ""girl crushes"". I suppressed my sexuality as well as my gender through my teen years and my 20s. Growing up Mormon would do that to you. I married a man when I was 22 and I'm still married to him now. I told him a few years ago I am bisexual (actually ended pansexual in nature) and we opened our marriage so I could explore that. Currently I'm in relationship with another man as well as a trans guy and I'm in love with all 3 of them. 

My trans boyfriend has opened my eyes to finding my own gender identity. I still identify as female (it's just easier that way at this point) but I don't feel feminine at all nor do I feel masculine at all. I'm somewhere in between. I could care less about what kind of genitalia I have and half the time I love my boobs and half the time I don't. It's weird going through this in my 30s. Shouldn't people know who they are by now?

2017-01-02 05:42:09,5ljnky,8,16,"My SO has recently come out as non-binary and started using they/them with select friends and co-workers. About a year and a half ago I came out as trans and ID with male pronouns and am now read as male in a lot of my interactions in public. We've been through a lot together and we both see how we are similar and different that we thought (we've been together 12 years and still learning new things every day). People used to see us as a couple or arty-butch lesbians, though we both just kind of saw ourselves as non-gendered and would rather not think about it much.

One problem that we run into a lot these days is that people are adapting to my new pronouns and identity but my SO's NB identity is getting made more invisible in a way because people place them as the ""she"" to my ""he,"" something that makes my SO extremely uncomfortable. For example, we get introduced or referred to in a binary pair, such as ""aunt and uncle,"" or ""mr. and ms."" While I get my gender affirmed, they get mis-gendered and they feel it more directly when its put in binary contrast like that. And besides, its downright silly for anyone to think of us as straight.

It's hard to know how to correct people because familial terms and honorifics are still so gendered. For me, when I get ""ladied"" or ""ma'amed"" I just say, ""I'm a guy"" and that works for me, but that isn't a meaningful option for my SO. So if we get ""ladied"" together, and I only correct the person about my pronouns/gender, I feel like I'm leaving my SO out to dry.

tl;dr I'm looking for advice about ways I can help affirm my SOs non-binary identity when they or we get mis-gendered by friends, family, or in public. They and I talk about this but so far haven't found any good solutions.

I've never been too concerned about fitting into gender norms, personally, as I've never felt like I've fit that great into them anyway.

In fact, the thought of going out dressed as a girl sounds like it would be a lot of fun, not just something sexually arousing. Edit: I also started shaving my body hair about a half a year ago. Again, it started out as something sexual, but it just feels... right. So I do it on the regular.(edited) At the same time though, I normally wear boys clothes, and those feel right on me too.

My second question is this: what would you guys recommend for someone who wants to have a body shape that's a bit more feminine, without putting myself at heavy risk of becoming sterile?

However, due to congenital scoliosis one breast is a B the other an A. My boobs also have literally zero sagging and I have only been binding (not that often either) for a few months. I have been assuming i would be a good candidate for peri or keyhole, especially my smaller breast. 
I have a friend who is a transman and he recommended I see his surgeon, Dr. Dulin. I went with him to the free consultation. I liked Dulin but man he did not want to do ANYTHING but DI. He also admitted my smaller breast was perfect for keyhole but just wanted to go ahead and chop off that nerve anyway. They acted surprised I cared so much about nipple sensation and like it was just no big deal.

I want to consult another surgeon. I feel like it was a good learning experience though. Seems to me if a surgeon specializes in a certain technique, they seem to only want to use that technique, regardless of whether it's really appropriate for the patient or not.

So, I'm in my late twenties and up until recently I've always considered myself a cismale. I'm a very performatively 'bro-y' guy sometimes and have a lot invested in the masculine friendships in my life.

TBH it was a weird situation all round, and alcohol was involved and I was more than a little fucked up by the experience so I did the oh-so-healthy thing of burying it for months and months but it's one of those ""You can't un-know it once you know it"" things that's been bubbling up for a while.

Pros:

- My Body: I work out a lot, but don't really see the results that I want.  Testosterone would give me the energy to go harder at the gym, and give me the muscles I want.  
- My trans identity will be validated.  As shitty as it sounds, I'll be ""really trans"" rather than being perceived as someone who is just trying on an identity.
- I wonder if I'll become more attractive,  Maybe some of the things I'm insecure about will get better with testosterone.
- I wonder if my anxiety will go down being read as male.  I wonder if I'll be able to speak in front of crowds with more ease.

Cons:

- I wonder if I'll become uglier.  I wonder if my jawline is too weak for when i become more masculine.

So, background: I'm a 20 year old nonbinary, transmasculine person, about a year and a half on testosterone.

Anyways, I attended new years's eve party with some very close female friends of mine, and there were also 3 guys there that I had never met before, who didn't and still don't know I'm trans.  These men, all in their mid-ish twenties, were very...""dude-bro"" for lack of a better term.  I really do hate to be so generalizing, but these guys were the type of people who, to me, just seemed to *reek* of toxic masculinity, or at least hyper masculinity.  They were standing/sitting around drinking beer and smoking cigs, and I thought to myself repeatedly throughout the night, ""these are the kinds of guys that would possibly ask me inappropriate questions if they found out I was trans, or joke behind my back about me not having a dick...  These guys remind me of the boys in my high school who tossed around the word ""f&amp;ggot.""  *These are the kinds of guys I am scared of.*""

Fast forward a few weeks...one of my female friends at the party, the one who I'm closest to, has been ignoring my text messages, so I confronted her about it.  She basically said that *she* felt uncomfortable with *me* being uncomfortable around ""other men.""  She said that she's friends with guys who are way more masculine than those people at the party, and that me being uncomfortable made her feel bad for having friends like that...

She basically wrote off my discomfort around these guys as me being uncomfortable with myself, as if she thought that I didn't feel ""manly enough"" in comparison.  But that's not at all what was going on.  

I feel like I should end this post here because I'm ranting...if I can clear anything up about the situation, please let me know.  I would really appreciate some feedback, so let me know if you feel similarly or know what I mean.  This has been bothering me a lot recently.  Thanks for reading.
