I was wondering if my specific description of my gender experience will ring any bells regarding an existing identity or wordage for the mildly complex ideas within. I haven't quite found any labels that match up perfectly, on the quest as it were hehe.

If all of my gender experience was broken down into a grouping of three parts, one third would be masculine, one third feminine, and the remaining third would be empty. In other words, the Masculine &amp; Feminine can be identified as bigender/dualgender--but I feel as if I don't experience or am influenced by my gender as much I could potentially be as a human in (USA) culture. So there's this (maybe agender) bit, but calling that trigender feels like I'm identifying heavily with the empty space, when that space seems more to serve as an example in the fraction model.
Then part of me wonders if the space is more of a gender neutral presence, I can't put a finger on it. The space in the 3/3 example feels both irrelevant BUT important to the equation (almost becoming a presence through its necessity.) 

Maybe I'm searching for a term that describes someone who experiences their gender in a small way. 
I feel like I'm playing and experimenting with it a lot (mentally and behaviorally, not just in expression.) My worldview is kinda like, I feel like a genderless soul in a cool flesh suit, and with that soul being filtered through an animal brain with chemicals the gender more or less is either developed, or heightened from a base personality concept.

Any thoughts on the matter are super appreciated. I don't get to talk about these topics with other folks often. This board seems super cool!!

Like, with traditonal gender roles being broken down, and traits not being gendered anymore, why am I not just a woman who dresses androgynously, etc. I tried explaining social dysphoria, and how saying I am a woman feels untrue, because I don't feel like one, and same thing for being a man.

2017-12-02 14:21:00,7h2uui,4,13,"Hi. I'm Ash, AFAB, about to turn 34, and just found out yesterday that I have stage 1 endometrial cancer. Apparently this isn't as scary as it sounds because it's curable - it just requires a hysterectomy, most likely a total one. 

This is something I've actually been thinking about as a possibility anyway as a potential way to handle some of my dysphoria -- my biggest triggers are gendering things like potentially being pregnant or getting my period or getting noticable five o'clock shadow (thanks, pcos). I'm on medication that helps reduce the facial hair and I went without a period for seven years, which was great. I was worried my obgyn would want me to go on birth control to handle my recent unexplained bleeding and I'd be in a bad place all over again.

My time on BC involved a lot of pain and a lot of emotion and weight gain and just bad stuff. Going off it was even worse but it was nice not bleeding even if it helped cause my current situation. So not having to worry about it sounds kind of amazing in some ways...but I've never had surgery and am terrified because cancer is scary.

I guess my reason for posting is wondering if any of my enby siblings have been through this (with or without the cancer diagnosis) and have anything they can tell me about actually going through this procedure personally. Because thinking about it while freaking out about bleeding all over the place is one thing, but having it happen is something totally different. 

-------

Tldr- I've been idly thinking of getting a hysterectomy to balance out some dysphoria but my daydreams are turning to reality in the very near future because it will cure my cancer. Looking for reassurance or advice or something.

2017-12-04 08:17:01,7hg0x8,3,17,"When I was 15, I read through descriptions of various gender identities and decided that demigirl sounded right. I didn't really think about it much after noticing that, though, and never mentioned it to anybody.

When I was 19, I spent some time trying to figure out what people meant when they talked about ""just knowing"" they were whatever gender. There were no neon arrows in my brain saying ""this gender feels right and all others feel wrong"" or whatever. I decided I was probably agender or something. I didn't come out to anybody, and I only thought about it on and off.

I'm 20 now. At the beginning of October I got a binder on a whim and wearing it felt really right. This made me wonder whether it was a gender thing. I'd strongly found myself relating to a few fictional trans men recently, which hadn't felt significant before but seemed kind of like it might be now. So I spent a lot of time online trying to figure out what felt right. I found myself posting on r/ftm (on a different throwaway), mentioning my experience, and desperately hoping they would tell me I was a trans guy. Which, you know, seemed like another pretty solid piece of evidence that I was a trans guy. So I went to the mall and got some men's clothes and I love love loved the way they looked on me and fit me in the binder. So I spent most of October and early November thinking of myself as a guy, with a new male name and he/him pronouns. It was really easy to make the switch, although there were some things I didn't like (not wearing nail polish or short shorts). Anyways, I came out as trans to my parents and best friend in early November, with a plan to go on hormones in January. My best friend was super great about it and my parents were less thrilled, but also it was clear that they'd eventually be accepting.

After coming out, I felt like I had made a huge mistake and permanently ruined my life. I wanted to go back to female name and pronouns. So I un-came out a few days after I came out. I figured that I was actually a butch woman; I still liked men's clothes and binding, but I'd misunderstood the reasons for those. I went back to thinking of myself with my old female name and she/her pronouns, and it was just as easy to make the switch as it had been before. And it felt really good to re-add some feminine things into my life. I saw my family for thanksgiving and I felt good being one of the women.

I felt happy and settled in my identity for a couple weeks or so after that. I've been really enjoying pairing men's clothes with nail polish, lipstick, and earrings. That combo is basically what I've been wearing every day for the past three-ish weeks, and it's felt very good.

But... for the past week or so I've been feeling like something's off. The idea that I am a cis girl, that that's who I am and probably who I've always been, makes me unhappy. It's like... I wish I was a trans guy. I've seen in a few places wisdom like ""cis people don't wish they're trans"" and ""if you've spent a ton of time questioning, that's a good sign that you're not cis."" Which makes sense. But also I'm pretty sure trans people don't immediately regret coming out as trans despite a lack of negative reactions, feel relief at reversing the coming out, and feel happy being seen by family as their birth gender. So I'm not entirely sure where that leaves me, but the nonbinary subreddit seemed like a good next step.

Here are some options that I'm considering
1) I'm a cis girl who strongly relates of the narratives of trans men due to internalized misogyny preventing me from relating to women. I really loved the idea of being a trans man because all of the clothing changes I had made so far had made me feel happier and this seemed like proof that being trans would make me happier. When I came out, it was the first time I faced real consequences instead of this being a fantasy, and that's why it felt wrong. 
2) I'm a trans guy who was moving too fast with coming out so soon after figuring out my identity. I got scared by making so many rapid changes, and I was afraid that coming out as trans would mean I lost or changed my relationships with my friends and family. I've gone back into denial and moved into my comfort zone.
3) I'm agender. I've been mistaking liking various societally-gendered things as identifying with the binary genders themselves, and I lack an actual internal gender. I liked the idea of being a trans guy because it seemed like it would provide me with a certainty about gender that I'd never felt before, but actually stating an allegiance to one gender over another felt wrong because I didn't actually have an internal sense of gender.
4) I'm bigender and/or genderfluid. The reason I'm having so much trouble pinning down my gender identity is because it's actually different at various moments in time. I was feeling particularly male in October, but coming out as a guy felt wrong because I also have a female side.

They/them pronouns don't feel right (they're actually worse than both she/her and he/him, I think?) and I'm not particularly drawn to attempting to be androgynous, so that's one thing ruled out at least.

I want to keep using she/her pronouns and my feminine name, at least for the most part. I plan to do that and continue dressing for the most part in masculine clothes and feminine accessories. It seems like if I know how I want to outwardly present my gender, I don't need to actually identify the internal feelings behind it... but thinking of myself as a girl still feels wrong, and I get this bad sinking feeling in my chest when I think about gender, and it really bothers me that there's this part of myself that's a mystery. It's like a bruise; I know that poking at my gender to figure out what's going well is just going to result in more turmoil, but I can't stop doing it until there's a point where I can think about my gender without this much turmoil.

I guess what I'm asking is... how do I figure out what my gender actually is? A lot of advice suggests figuring out your desired gender presentation (what clothes you want to wear, etc) but I'm feeling pretty good about that; my issue's more of figuring out which gender my outward presentation is linked to. All four options I mentioned above seem extremely likely, even though they're also all contradictory, and arbitrarily picking one doesn't feel like a great way to do this.

2017-12-06 10:21:13,7hx675,29,0,"Hello,

I am writing this post as I am currently in a rather delicate situation and I am in serious need of help/clarifications/advice.

First of all, I am a cisgender straight male in my 30s. Straight as an arrow, in fact. Always been, most likely always will. 
I grew up in a very conservative and traditional family, which means that I had a very binary approach to gender, sex, and whatnot. To me the world was very simple - either you are male, or female, gay, or bi. That's all - four options, anything more than that is unnecessary.

As a straight male, I like females. Period. No question. Simple. I also technically like lesbians or bi females, as my survival instinct still tells me that their bodies allow reproduction, thus I feel sexual attraction.

This being said, I have been recently challenged by individuals who clearly have issues with this restrictive system - and invited me to open my mind and realise that there are lots of people who simply do not fit into these simplistic categories. 

Note that this is a VERY recent thing. I am still bound (""shackled"", as some might say) by my beloved binary world, and letting go is stupidly hard. 

Now, this would just be an academic exercise anyway - as I am still a cisgender straight white male, brought up in a wealthy western family. The epitome of privilege, some may think. It is just a matter of looking at this new, complex system - and accept it for what it is - accept that a lot of individuals feel the need to broaden this shallow binary system. Easy, as long as it does not involve you or challenges your own identity.

However, recent circumstances led me to enter a relationship with a girl, who defines herself as agender. Note that I am using female pronouns here, because I don't know what else to use and, frankly, using anything else makes me even more uncomfortable so I avoid it for my own sanity.

Now, this may be nothing to you - but you must understand that to me this is a big deal. A huge one. 

I define myself as straight. I am attracted to females and the thought of physical contact with a man (unless it is a manly fistfight) makes me nauseous. I am not exaggerating. 

I am now faced with a terrible question.

Am I still straight? Would being in a relationship with someone who is agender (but of female sex, obviously) make me something else? 
Does being attracted to a female body override the being in a relationship with a non-female-identified person? I would say yes, as if I had in front of me a very attractive female sentient android I would probably still want a relationship with it even if technically agender, but here we are talking about other humans, not things. As I said above I am also still attracted to the female body regardless of the gender identity of the person that inhabits it (lesbians), but a relationship with them could never actually happen. Also, as far as I understand, sexual orientation and gender identity are separate anyway, so....I am confused. What am I attracted to and where does that put me in this new complex system that may be too convoluted for me?

Again, I understand that all of this may sound close-minder and whatnot. But please try to understand my situation. It is not easy for me.

What are your thoughts?

Thank you.

Straight as an arrow, in fact. Always been, most likely always will. \nI grew up in a very conservative and traditional family, which means that I had a very binary approach to gender, sex, and whatnot. To me the world was very simple - either you are male, or female, gay, or bi. That\'s all - four options, anything more than that is unnecessary.\n\nAs a straight male, I like females. Period. No question. Simple. I also technically like lesbians or bi females, as my survival instinct still tells me that their bodies allow reproduction, thus I feel sexual attraction.\n\nThis being said, I have been recently challenged by individuals who clearly have issues with this restrictive system - and invited me to open my mind and realise that there are lots of people who simply do not fit into these simplistic categories. \n\nNote that this is a VERY recent thing. I am still bound (""shackled"", as some might say) by my beloved binary world, and letting go is stupidly hard. \n\nNow, this would just be an academic exercise anyway - as I am still a cisgender straight white male, brought up in a wealthy western family. The epitome of privilege, some may think. It is just a matter of looking at this new, complex system - and accept it for what it is - accept that a lot of individuals feel the need to broaden this shallow binary system.

2017-12-07 07:32:35,7i4u57,7,4,"This turned into quite the rant, sorry.

For quite some time now I've identified as agender, but the reason is making me question if that's really who I am. I've tried to dissect my feelings, and this is the conclusion at which I've arrived:

I find sex revolting and traumatic; thinking about it too long (more than a few seconds in a not-vague/abstract form) turns into a panic attack, and libido/arousal feels disgusting. Gender is often linked with sex (not to say that sexuality correlates with gender, per se, but certain stereotypes are sexualized and I haven't seen agender people sexualized nearly as much as gender-identifying people). Because I want to get away from anything to do with sex, I want to separate myself from gender. At some point I'd like to have surgery to remove my genitals without replacing them with the binary alternative; and if at all possible, at the same time remove any libido or sex drive.

During the time I was on HRT and actively anorexic (right now I'm eating more but it's a struggle, I want to ""relapse"" and I can't entirely convince myself that would be a bad thing), my hormone levels were extremely low (just above male range estrogen, low female range for testosterone). This made me very happy, and I suspect (I need to make an appointment for follow-up blood work) that my estrogen levels have been increasing as I eat more (my libido is coming back, for one).

I'd love to have both sex hormones reduced to 0 or near 0, but I haven't been able to find anything on Google regarding low sex hormones aside from ""reduced libido"" (very desirable) and bone density loss (not so desirable); safety is a concern, but I haven't been able to find any resources regarding anything I could take that would prevent bone density loss aside from increasing one sex hormone or the other.

If absolutely necessary, I will allow my estrogen levels to increase, though I despise the idea of feminization. I'd like to avoid that outcome if at all possible.

That's not to say I'm aromantic; but the form of romance I would want might not be a healthy one—I just want someone to rely on to make me feel safe and valid, and while I would reciprocate as much as possible, I don't know how much I really have to offer; on the other hand, I would also want someone who would rely on me in the same way—but not the same person (and I would be happy to be in a 3-person relationship, though at the same time can't help feel that it's wrong—all my life I've been taught that ""civilized people are monogamous"" and I guess that's really stuck with me).

I've spoken to a therapist about this stuff, but only in fairly vague terms; I don't feel comfortable bringing up stuff from my past without anonymity, and the thought that there might be consequences for certain people if the therapist felt the need to take action is concerning.

TL;DR: I'm worried that trauma might be steering me away from binary transgender feelings (MtF) and ""making"" me agender; and from what I've been able to piece together from introspection, this seems probable.

Does anyone have any advice? I'm unsure if I should just ""get over it"" (the therapist's advice, the same as with anorexia) and let my estrogen increase and hope I can overcome this at some point in the future, or if I should let these feelings be valid, not question them, and do what makes me comfortable right now.

2017-12-08 12:00:52,7iej9k,11,5,"I was wondering where would one categorize this kind of person, i know im not alone in feeling like this since through time i ve seen quite a few threads regarding this and i would like to get some more opinions about this, especially if someone has any idea what is the root of this feeling.

And also because i have no idea what a label for this would be, like i definitely do feel male, i like my chubby male body and face(minus the current genitals, luckily that is solvable) but not like 100% male, maybe something like 80% male 20% female?

I am talking to a gender therapist about this and apparently he has seen people like that before, says like 3 people every year looking to do this. And we pretty much ruled out being transsexual since i dont have the signs of one and i knew that already but we have yet to find out what deep reason causes these feelings. Luckily he understands the importance of the matter and is talking with some known surgeons in Thailand that would be able to do this surgery for my specific case.

Anyway here's my experience, i think the first sign there was something different with me when probably in early puberty where the mere thought of my sticking my penis anywhere was repulsive and utterly wrong, it just didnt fit ""me"" to do anything like that so i started thinking myself as a kind of exclusive bottom gay guy.

Then i remember i first stumbled upon a guy who had mtf surgery and lived as a man on the internet and everything just felt fitting for me to be something like that, as in it made sense and i remember researching a lot about it because it felt like something i should do, i didnt have many strong feelings about it like i do now but i did feel i should do that in the future. Sadly the more time i spent researching the more i found out people saying that there was no way to get this surgery done outside of back alley surgeons and you had to pretend to be an mtf transgender to get it done which needed a year of female hormones. And since i didnt have the resources and was pretty disappointed i kinda put that plan on the backburner consciously.
Too bad my mind apparently wasnt satisfied with that because after some time i started having trans thoughts, that they would often focus on having a vagina and even though i just didnt like the idea of being a woman i tried to say that it was some kind of internalized misogyny because these feelings wouldnt stop, but after some time i realized that i simply didnt like the idea of being a woman in my every day life, not even once and it wasnt any internalized misogyny causing this, it was just me not fitting with that image. That caused me a great deal of confusion and similar repeating trans thoughts that only disappeared once i started thinking about being a man with female genitals more seriously instead of just something silly i wanted to do, and only then did everything just make sense and all forms of trans thoughts disappeared. 
Only after accepting that i felt a lot more secure about me in general and who i am, because everything just fitted perfectly though my feelings about wanting to get this operation done are a lot stronger about it. And i dont see this as a very sexual thing, it is more of a feeling that i need to have that genitals and live my life like that since i dont intend to be having that much sex since im not a very slutty person in general lul

I've always wanted to change my name since as far back as I can remember... but ever since I came out as NB, picking a new name had CONSTANTLY been on my mind. It was a big stressor for me, to be quite honest. I had talked about going by Saige with my girlfriend and we both liked it a bit. But then I realized that if my first name was Saige, that means my first/last name would be Saige Frances. (Frances is my legal middle name, but I have good feelings connected to it, so I decided I wanted it to be my last name.) The problem with Saige Frances is that a spoken word/hip hop artist that I like is called that (spelled differently though). Soooo.... yeah. Awkward. No way. I kept thinking of other names that I could use, but nothing ever felt like it fit. So I went with a fairly gender neutral name that I loved the sound of. Avery.

2017-12-10 20:33:45,7iwjqj,8,12,"Hey everyone! I got a question for you.
I'm AMAB and came out something like 2 months ago (only to me, and to my girlfriend) as genderqueer/nonbinary/agender. This was weird, but great. I can finally put some words on what I am, and I am (sometimes) happy with myself.

But.

The problem is I'm not really out, and I can't really express as I want. I still looks like a man, and aside from some sweaters and t-shirts that come from the woman aisle, there is nothing that could tell I'm not cis when you look at me.
I'm not ready (and probably never will) to be out at work and in my small town, and this is why I can't really change the way I look. I have more freedom at home, where I began to express a little more as I want.
This begins to be a problem as I am more and more open on my gender identity when I'm home. When I am outside/at work, it makes me think I'm just a cis-male who is looking for problems he doesn't have. I know expression is really different from gender identity and everything. But still. A lot of people even in the LGBTQ community are saying that genderqueer people are fake, or just liberal bulshit. And in the pro-genderqueer / pro-enby media productions, you always see those cool queer and androgynous looks that makes you think this is the only way you should express your gender as a non binary person.

So, finally, here is my question. Sorry if it sounds dumb:
How can I ""feel"" more androgynous everyday in my gender expression, without being obviously queer to my coworkers and my neighbors?
I already want to upgrade my cool socks collection with a cool tights and stockings collection to wear under my jeans. But aside from that, I can't really see what I could do without being too visible to other people.

So I'm a trans girl, and I've been on hormones for a little over a year.  I've kinda leaned toward more gender neutral / androgynous presentations because I just feel more comfortable in general that way.

Nowadays, I like feeling masculine sometimes and I like feeling feminine sometimes, but I mostly like kinda being in between.

That said though, I also want to be female bodied.  Like androgynous, but also female bodied.  Does that just make me a trans girl?

For other uses, ""person"" feels a little... I dunno? Impersonal? It just doesn't adequately provide any detail as to who I'm talking about beyond them being human.

 As a result, I usually use occupation titles or physical descriptors (e.g. ""I'm phoning my representative"" or ""do you see the kid decked out in BTS gear?"", which proves to be effective in most contexts.

Additionally, in a casual setting, I sometimes use words neutrally that originally referred to males, i.e. guys, dude, etc., but I would rather avoid these terms to avoid harm.

Furthermore, what is one to do in regards to honorifics? Unless they are doctor, a person is usually referred to as either Mr. X, Ms. X, or Mrs. X.

One day, I was talking to my grandma about Queer Issues. It’s already heavily established that I’m pan as fuck, and I’m confident in that part of my identity. When we got to the discussion of trans issues, my grandma said that she’s always felt like a woman – and asked if I did, too. Well, she was more like, “Haven’t you?” meaning she expected a yes. It was rhetorical, because I’m into traditionally feminine things. I love makeup, I love dresses, and I presented as femme pretty often.

My response was unexpected – like, so unexpected that I didn’t even see it coming. “Uh, yeah, I mean mostly.”

She’s obviously confused. I’m like, “oh shit.” She tells me to talk to my therapist, I say it doesn’t bother me, and I go to think about it.

It’s been a while since that discussion. I think it’s been a year? Maybe? I have no concept of time. Ever since then, I’ve been thinking about it nonstop. I remember being fifteen – four years ago – maybe even younger and thinking about how cool it would be to have a binder. I think about all the times that I’ve been jealous of my cis girl best friend being perceived as andro. I remember trying to bring up the fact that maybe I’m not a girl and just dropping it because I didn’t feel like getting into it. I think about a lot of things.

And then comes the dreaded Imposter Syndrome Thoughts.
Here’s the big problem I’m facing. I feel like I don’t have enough dysphoria. I understand that not everyone has it, and I really don’t care whether someone lacks it because it’s not my business. But here I am. I absolutely don’t have any bottom dysphoria – genitals just really don’t bother me. I don’t even really think about them. But there are times where I have some Rough top dysphoria. It’s just so rare, though. I really hate it when others point out my chest, and I hate calling them breasts to the point where I didn’t even like typing that. But I can point them out fine? Most of the time? And I don’t really care if someone refers to me by she/her pronouns. I’d prefer they/them but I don’t get dysphoria from it.

I’m just really confused. There’s not a day that goes by without me thinking of what the fuck is going on, and it’s been like that for a while now. I keep thinking about coming out, but then I’m scared I’m just faking. I can’t wait for the day that I can get a binder, just so I can go as masc when I feel like it, but what if I’m just butch?

Even writing this I’m confused. I think I’m NB. I like being NB. The idea of being seen as andro even when I’m leaning heavily femme or masc brings me joy. I want to be able to wear makeup and a dress and still have people question what gender I am. That’s my goal. But I’m still just. Feeling weird, I guess? Do cis people ever feel like this? Is this just an average thing? Could someone help me out?

I don't believe in gender as an intrinsic quality, I believe that it is a cultural one, shaped by social expectations and various experiences. 


Gender is to my mind entirely seperate from sex (other than the ways in which it is culturally percieved to be connected) and that Gender *IS* Gender Presentation (in how one presents themselves to themselves), it isn't a choice persay (because your perception of it is cultivated by things outside of your control), but is socially constructed rather than somehow intrinsic (coming from genetics or some kind of a-priori soul), which to me is fine because identity studies is very important to me, i don't think it has to be intrinsic to be valid, so many valid and important human experiences are constructed in that way. 

To me, neither man nor woman captures what I am, i feel as if I have traits of both (and that this is true of most people) in a way that makes me feel uncomfortable identifying as either gender. I find myself often splitting my avatars in games and the like with a 50-50 balance, or deciding on them based entirely off other aesthetic concerns (lack of a slender male body type virtually guarantees i'll select a female character, for instance). 


I do idealize a world where Gender isn't as meaningful as it is today, more like a personality question, and that comes to me from another part of me which is very important: my feminism, I resent gender roles and a lot of the baggage that comes with it when you describe yourself using a gender and think that no one really fits into these categories as they're understood. For a little while, after meeting some non-binary people I identified as such, viewing my own identity as a rejection of gender as it's understood in society, a sort of gender-atheism, but then stopped because I didn't feel secure doing so when i realized some people seem to view their non-binary identity as it's own category on a list of possible genders. Like ""are you a Man? Woman?

I’m worried they will misunderstand, and think I am a masc lesbian. Nothing wrong with that, but it’s not the right label for me as I am not attracted to women. I’d rather they percieve me as a straight woman than a lesbian one :P

2017-12-14 18:42:01,7jtmz2,6,31,"As someone who quite regularly wears breastforms, I can say that they're pretty cool. I can also say that buying my first pair was a big step and that I ran into a lot of problems I could not really find an answer for. I hope that, by sharing my experiences here, some people who are looking to buy breastforms can get a better idea of the issues they might run into and what they have to look out for. 

It has been a few years now since I bought my first pair of breast forms. I live in a small-ish country in Europe, where Amazon or eBay don’t really exist. Buying breast forms therefore, was easier said than done. Most of the breast forms I found on the internet, were the full-on medical-grade prosthetics. Being a student, they were way out of my league price-wise. After an extensive search, I found a fetish shop that sold breast forms as well. They had a little web shop, so I could have ordered them online, but I had no idea which size I had to buy and, since they were still over 100 euros, I decided to be bold and go visit the brick and mortar fetish shop, so I could compare sizes and decide if I thought they were worth the money. They were. [Lo and behold (NSFW)](http://imgur.com/9oagsyP)
[From a different angle, still NSFW](http://imgur.com/LfPvuLw)

Probably because of the feeling that I had to overcompensate for the masculinity of the rest of my body, I went a bit overboard with the size. I bought E-cup breast forms and even though I have pretty broad shoulders, they were on the large side. I wasn’t too bothered by that though. I was never going to go outside and the bigger size meant they were softer and bouncier than a smaller size would have been; not a bad thing, in my experience. 

**My first bra**
But, of course, breast forms are pointless if you have nothing to hold them in the place where actual breasts would preferably go. I had a low-impact sports bra at the time, which wasn’t really up to the job of holding 1200 grams of silicone in place. I decided to go online and buy myself a bra. I knew a full cup bra would be the way to go, so that my breast forms wouldn’t fall out of the top of my bra if I leant forwards, and decided to go for a padded T-shirt bra. This however, caused some issues. I measured my ribcage and decided that I would need a 90E bra. The circumference turned out to be spot on: it was tight, but definitely not uncomfortably so, at the most outwards set of hooks. It was the cups that did not agree with my breast forms. Even though the number in a bra size represents the circumference of your ribcage, and not the width of your breast, people with a larger circumference, will most likely have wider breasts. The cups of a 90E bra therefore, are quite wide. Breast forms, on the other hand, are measured in projection size only (perhaps this is not the case for the medical-grade ones, but the cheaper ones come in projection sizes only). This means I did not buy 90E breastforms, but E-size breastforms. As it turns out, my breast forms were way too narrow [for the cups of a 90E bra](http://imgur.com/An67Sgl)

Another issue with breast forms and a padded bra is that, even though breast forms are quite squishy, they are not as malleable as natural breasts. This wouldn’t be too much of a problem, were it not that the curve of the cups of my bra was completely different [than the curve of my breast forms](http://imgur.com/SuoIKet)

My breast forms had to sit quite high up in my bra therefore, making them spill over the top even in a full cup bra. 

**My second bra**
Since cups of my first bra were way too wide, and since the shape didn’t work either, I decided to go for a non-padded, wireless sports bra as my second bra. This bra had no cups that could be too narrow or the wrong shape, so it seemed perfect. And it was. At first. The problem with a bra with no cups however, is the uniboob effect: everything gets squished to the middle, were it becomes one big, unrecognizable mass. This problem is way worse if your breasts are connected in no way, shape or form, which is why this plan did not really work either. 

**My third bra**
The third bra I bought, was a bra with underwires and non-padded, full-coverage cups. I bought it in a 90D because I measured myself and was actually somewhere in between an E and a D. This bra turned out to be spot on. It hold everything in place wonderfully, was reasonably comfortable and worked with the shape of my breast forms. I am quite pleased with how they [turned](http://imgur.com/4YnfJXV) out to [look](http://imgur.com/WFgOy92) with the right bra. 

**From here**
What is lacking still, is a way to sleep with breast forms. It happens quite often that I don’t want to take off my breasts at the end of the day. Sleeping with an underwired bra however, is far from ideal, so I’m still looking for a way to make that work. 

**ps**
One additional problem with boobs that aren't attached: you can end up sitting on one and cause [this](http://imgur.com/2qhEefs).

as the title says, I'll come out - not sure how, when and if - before it's important to be 100% sure.

Anyway, I'm 60% sure I'm non-binary, 20% not sure trans-femme and 20% queer. The issue about being 100% non-binary is from my opinion how society gives gender to everything. FYI, I'm amab.

The first step into NB was in 2016, when I got myself a short female haircut. Male haircuts pissed me off. Next step was buying female gloves for cycling - something I've been forced to because of my small hands.

Since summer 2017, I'm doing stuff to appear more feminine. A reason, why I'm not 100% sure about calling myself NB. The goal is to appear feminine, because most male stuff makes me bored/sad/angry, female stuff instead makes me happy.

The point why I struggle to call myself trans-femme is because if there wouldn't be a gender labeling the female stuff, I'd be just someone who wants some kind of clothes/styling/haircuts and has some kind of body. So that's the heavy point, why I think I'm non-binary, even though I'm changing into more ""feminine"" appearance.

For my mind I've made some online-tests (Cogati or how it's called, not just 5 question-lifestyle-magazine) and the results have been from ""feminine male"" to ""androgynous"". There's a lot of stuff considered male/masculine, which doesn't fit to me. So it's not just my looks but also my mind, which seem non-binary.

2017-12-16 10:38:21,7k6efn,4,9,"So I have been out to a lot of my friends as nonbinary/genderqueer for a little over a year after finally just feeling like I need to not be in denial. 

For the longest time I thought I was just a cis but I wasn't. So I have presented more andro and tried but I feel attached to a lot of masculine traits and characteristics. I like have some muscle and some facial hair but I also want smooth skin and to wear make up. 

My wardrobe is all over place. I can't bring myself go wear dresses or skirts because I know I will be harassed by family of some friends but a lot of my shirts,  tops, sweaters and outerwear are unisex or on the feminine side. I size up on a lot feminine stuff to fit my masculine proportions and I like how they look but some times I default to what feels safe and what let's me pass..

It is with passing I feel like I am doing a disservice go others especially other enbys.  I don't want to feel ashamed of how I present and I want to be validated but I feel scared of appearing too. Out there. My make up is subtle. I swear skinny jeans that look more masculine or just unisex. No embellished pockets usually not super duper skinny. I default to converse sneakers even though I have some more feminine booties or boots with heels. I wear shirts with wider necklines but hide them under sweaters and flannel shirts.

I don't use my ""dead"" when I can avoid it but a lot of people know me by it and all my cards are in that name. I changed my name on all my social media besides Facebook but only a few people actually know me by my new assumed name others things it's just me being ""quirky"".

I guess all of this is me just feeling scared that I'm an imposter and that I'm compromising so much I am not being mg authentic self and also that I'm just a phony.

Also dating again as an enby is really difficult because I really don't have the patience to explain myself to people who don't already know. 

If anyone can just shed light or help me or encourage that'd be great. I like a lot and don't post often but I do follow a lot of what goes on.

Okay, so, I'm AFAB, and I have complicated feelings on my gender and stuff. I've never felt like a girl, and I hated it when people imposed their own standards of what girls should be like or womanhood on me. It's not that I felt like a boy, either, I just didn't feel like anything. 

I don't feel entirely comfortable with being seen as a girl, and sometimes I hate how feminine I can look, but it's more complicated than that, because I'm attracted to girls, and I find feminine girls very pretty, so a part of me is pleased at feeling like I match my beauty standards. 

And since I've always had people tell me what I can and can't do because of my gender, I've started sort of identifying as a girl as a sort of rebellion, if that makes sense? Like, your beliefs about my gender won't stop me from doing what I want.

When I imagine being AMAB, the thought doesn't bother me but it's not appealing either. The only difference I can imagine between being AFAB and AMAB is the socialization. I think I'd feel discomfort at being seen as very masculine, but that's also how I feel about being seen as very feminine. Like ideally I'd just have a body that's not masculine or feminine.

But it's more complicated than that, because I do feel like being socialized as a girl affected me, and when it comes to being a lesbian, I still feel identification with that term even if I don't feel entirely like I'm a girl. Like it's not entirely accurate to say I'm attracted to my own gender, but it's not entirely accurate to say I'm not.

I feel ashamed for being trans. I'm in constant denial of myself and it's hurts. I can not sleep because it's the only time I feel like I'm not judged when it's at night and everyone is asleep. I have an anxiety disorder, and I'm hyperaware of everyone around me and I'm afraid of being judged by everyone. I like a guy who is openly gay, he knows I'm questioning  (I even feel like I'm in denial saying that sentence), and we've had this sexual tension for over a year. It's been long enough that I know it's not one sided. Then I feel ashamed for even liking gay men or wanting to be a queer guy (idk if I'm binary or not), and liking someone who is effeminate. My dad acts like he's someone that shouldn't be taken seriously, and acts like it's ridiculous how he's acting. I didn't even connect this feeling to wanting to be transmasculine to this, I just thought I was a mistake and I shouldn't exist and I shouldn't be alive because I confuse everyone (except for this guy that I'm simultaneously trying to avoid and get closer to at the same time). But now that I'm starting to realize this about myself, I feel like a freak, like I'm disgusting and wrong and it's so fucking hard. My parents don't like it. My family wouldn't like it, maybe except my brother and sister, and my people in my school treat me like a freak.

Am I misrepresenting them?\n2nd question) Are they offended by me using NB color coding to make a point about situations that only made records on a male/ female status? As of now, there are no datasets that record gender in a nonbinary state, so my lecturing will have to continue with M/F identifications, but I want to include the NB students in my class and I don\'t know how to do that.""\n\nThanks for any help! \n', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Representation in statistics/data presentation?', 'created': 1513577577.0}"

I can't do penetration because I get so dysphoric and it feels so wrong. It didn't used to be like this; I had sex with male bodied people for a year and never experienced any discomfort.

2017-12-22 11:10:18,7lgtev,3,5,"So AMAB Non-binary/genderqueer here and I see lots of questions about clothes and stuff. I love more andro mens fashion but often find I am drawn to more feminine leaning clothes. I hate how a lot of default unisex items or trendy stuff is masculine leaning, because masc tends to be the default gender clothing category.

I love a lot of different styles so I don't know where to begin I am hoping someone can see the holes I can fill in  I guess I do different categories for organisation sake.


Hats- I wear a lot of beanie hats and dad hats when I do but find dad hats like the name are very masculine while beanies are universal. 



Outwear- I have a few denim jackets and also some longer coats that are more for the winter some fur trim type details and a boxier silhouette. I'm also fond of biker type leather jackets, recently found a silver one that is cropped pretty high though and not sure how to wear thing cropped to my natural waist. Trench coat, 


Sweaters- mostly cardigans and some with wider necklines or some drape to them mostly in neutral colors, black, brown, one in maroon.


Shirts- a couple simple floral button up shirts in softer thinner fabrics, a couple striped long sleeve nautical type shirts with stripes, a couple tees with wider neck lines and shorter sleeves also falling just below the waist just above the hip with slight flare. Flannel shirts mostly oversized


Pants/jeans- work pants that are kinda boxy and loose, skinny jeans that come to the waist in black, grey and dark and light blue, a couple pairs of boot cut/flared jeans, some cropped pants. Cargo pants, I want to try to find Collettes ( I think that's what I mean,  the looser cropped pants) I also have some leggings but they are mostly worn at home and not out 


Shoes ( probably the category that is the most all over the place) I have several pairs of converse all stars, some vans slip ons and high tops, doc marten derbies , black combat boots, cowboy boots in brown, some 1.5 inch side zips boots in black suede, black Chelsea boots also some random nikes like air force ones.

So this is kind of some of the things I am working with. I struggle a lot with footwear. I feel like most of my boots can be pretty unisex but I wish I knew how to wear more feminine boots, I don't feel like heels or flats would work me and my wardrobe, I want to get another pair of two with a slight heel but I don't quite know how to style them so if doesn't just like in wearing really feme boots, I found they look good with either super skinny jeans or slight flared jeans. Converse are great but I also feel like a teenager wear em. I was thinking of pennyloafers of some kind for another casual option.

Other thoughts. I know winter isn't a good time but I want to try cropped tee shirts not super cropped but maybe just a little skin and maybe worm under a cardigan or unbuttoned shirt or flannel, i have been expufementing with jewelry a lot too. I like simple cuffs and bangles, my watch is kinda masculine, I wear rings sometimes, I wear pendants and simple choker necklaces.

So if anyone can give any tips on improved my andro femme lean or just being more andro that would be cool. I'm not sure if this would be met well at any of the fashion subs so I turned here.

I would be fine with any or none.\n\nIs this an actual thing? Am I just a cis girl who doesn’t understand gender? Is there a word for this? Am I just babbling nonsense?\n\nThank you for reading :)\n\nEDIT: I found a video with EXACTLY how I feel. I relate strongly with what she says about how she feels about gender.

I [20] am AFAB nonbinary(they/them). I don't consider myself trans, don't like the label, and have no current or future plans to transition--in any way. Ever. 
If I had to describe my identity in detail, it'd be genderfluid-bigender. I fluctuate between male and female with androgyny on both ends. Since I identify with my birth sex more than a little bit and date women exclusively, I'm gay. Definitely butch. Definitely prefer MOC expression about 90% of the time. Which leads me to the point of this post. 
My mom, sister, and I were at the mall today. Since I'm home from college, I can't bind so I wear a lot of baggy clothes; basically I make do with what I have. I pack discreetly but not often, just to be safe. Today was a male day-- boxers, packing, as masculine as I could be. My mom was off doing her own thing and we were in Forever 21. I went over to the men's section to look at sweaters since I have no men's winter stuff. When my sister found me, she gave me a weird look. As we walked out, she said:
""I know you're nonbinary, but it looks like you're transitioning. You're averse to anything feminine, looking in the men's section, and Mom thinks you're transitioning.""
I tried to tell her no, but she didn't believe me. She kept trying to get me to admit I was trans/transitioning. 
Normally I fluctuate a lot more, but being home with my family, I feel they're pushing me to express femininely. Which means I've been more MOC lately. 
How do I get my family off my back?

2017-12-29 23:06:09,7mxryc,2,4,"I guess you would classify me as non-binary. I don’t classify myself as any gender personally I just say I’m male because I was born that way. I don’t feel male or female. There’s other stuff. And I don’t necessarily really act like either gender although I only dress up as male now. But my fucked up parents emotionally abused and mentally abused me and my dad physically abused me and my ex fiancée did all of that to me and also shamed me (about my autogynephilia, sorry I know that’s not a good term, but I can’t think of another term for it). I was codependent on her and she said things and I was depressed and the relationship was in chaos and my life had a bunch of stress in it and my past was ganging up on me etc. And I became extremely confused and had an identity crisis and then it culminated in me getting a gender therapist and seeing a doctor and going to asktransgender and then I transitioned hormonally to female for an entire year. I also thought I was bisexual, but I turned out to be heterosexual (including attracted to trans woman because I view them as woman and attracted to some non-binaries) 

Then I detransitioned and now I just literally a week ago had a bilateral mastectomy (gynechomastia surgery) because you wouldn’t believe it, but I had double D amount of breasts (500 cc each) that fast (even though it didn’t look like it because the way the male breast forms compared to the female breasts so it probably looked more like a female b breast). Before that I just constantly wore a tight binder everyday all day. I detransitioned around the same time a friend of mine detransitioned. But he hasn’t been there for me. Most male detransitioners never talk about their experiences with others and distance themselves from it compared to female detransitioners whom I notice usually form communities online to talk or help each other.

So ya i guess I’m what you would say non-binary I’m barely able to cope with my gender crap. Although I just look like a guy. I transitioned then detransitioned. And I have nobody to talk about it too really. I feel ashamed of how fucked up I am. I hate gender roles and gender behaviors I’m expected of. It all bothers me. I don’t feel like I fit in anywhere with anyone. I feel like the only way I can have a relationship is if I hide my past (or the occasional autogynephilia stuff). I just feel alienated from everyone. I feel I don’t belong anywhere. And since I’m a detransitioner I’m also scared no one will accept me here or talk to me. It’s like everyone who went through the same thing as I did like my friend deliberately silences themselves scared of being judged. I mean I don’t even want to be known for it now that I’ve detransitioned. 

Since you all feel in the middle of gender or both or a third gender or don’t feel any gender I thought you might be a community I could talk too? Or find a friend to talk too about it all?

2018 is the year I take care of myself a bit better. This means doctors (for a lot more than just transitioning - life-threatening allergies, progressive hearing loss, a couple of other fairly minor things). 

Before I talk to the doc about being trans/NB, I want to arm myself with ALL the information, and y'all seem to know what's what!

I'm hoping to talk to the doc about hormone therapy - not as far as T, but like an estrogen blocker that would mimic menopause or something. Google is generous with info about AMAB antiandrogens, and full AFAB HRT but pretty limited with the info I'm looking for (could be my region tho).

Likewise if someone has any experience with this under the Ontario healthcare system, any intel is much appreciated. 

&lt;3 happy new year everyone!
