It's taken me a long time to feel more comfortable being out as non-binary, and I'm still getting there. One of my major hangups has been feeling like I don't ""deserve"" to have people acknowledge my gender identity and that I can't expect them to understand or see me the way I want to be seen. However, I've been fortunate to be able to be able to volunteer in some theoretically trans-friendly environments, and that's made me start to feel more comfortable.

But I had an awkward experience recently. I do some LGBTQ-related volunteer work, and we often start events and meetings by going around the room and introducing ourselves with our names and pronouns. I actually have some mixed feelings about this. When I initially started this work, I felt awkward because I wasn't really out yet and felt pressured to either out myself or lie. Now I am more out, but it feels weird when I'm often the only person in the room who uses non-binary pronouns or who doesn't pass as the gender they identify with. It really puts me on display. And while I understand that a lot of the intent of this exercise is to challenge the idea that you can assume someone's pronouns just by looking at them, I don't feel like I can take for granted that the environment is really going to be inclusive toward non-binary/gender-nonconforming people if it seldom comes up. When all the male-passing people use ""he"" and all the female-passing people use ""she,"" it's hard to actually know if people are good at remembering and respecting people's pronouns when they're not ""obvious.""

The other day, I was doing a volunteer event with a cis person who's one of the leaders of our trans outreach projects. In the context of the event we were doing, we actually talked about trans issues and the value of not assigning a binary gender to someone based on how they look. I was vocally out as being non-binary and using they/them pronouns. And yet the person I was working with *consistently* used female pronouns for me. It was very awkward. Ironically, I'm not actually that concerned about what pronouns people use for me. But if I'm in a setting where sharing is actively encouraged, and I state that I use they/them, it's *really* noticeable if someone disregards or forgets that. And it was awkward that some of the others in our group, who were a lot less familiar with trans people, made a much bigger effort to not misgender me than the person who was supposed to be an expert. I didn't say anything, and I didn't really *want* to say anything. And I don't want to be unfair, because I know that realistically, it can be hard for some people to remember pronouns and get used to non-binary pronouns. But I also feel like if we're creating settings where there's a lot of emphasis on using the correct pronouns and not misgendering people, it looks bad if those principles aren't followed well in practice.

 (From my dad). Like it's some sort of joke. Ha ha ha, my struggle with identity is *so* funny. 

* ""You lied to me."" (Also from my dad). This was after I told him I want to come out publicly and ask for neutral pronouns.

It wouldn't kill him to read the f*cking thing. If he does that though he might actually have to acknowledge his prejudices. God forbid that happens.

At the same time, I worry that they're right. The other night I found myself googling the link between NB identities and mental illness. The pressure to be cisgender is hard.

I have an amazing friend, who recently started her transition from f to m. He's still far away from surgery and and hormones, but the first steps have been made. Cool.

I'm female, and have always been attracted to girls. Never really dated a guy, just had some casual one night stands when i was in college. I don't like to call myself lesbian or bisexual or whatever, because well...it feels like a limitation.

When i met this friend he was still female (and dating a girl) we met online and had some awsome conversations about love, relationships and gender. I learned a lot from him.
We only met irl recently, and this is were it gets confusing for me. Looking at him he has all the ""bodily aspects"" of a female and for the time being he's cool with that (always been genderfluid). Saying that when he's more femine he is more attracted to girls (lesbian) and when he's more masculin he's more into guys (gay), pansexual?

I felt an instant attraction and told him that. We had sex a few times. And i still feel incredibly attracted to him, the confusing part is....i feel attracted to him as he is now...but even more when i think about him after the final stages of his transition. Does that sound as weird as i think it does?

To add to that, i'm not even sure if i identify as a girl...but this is the first time i've said that out loud and i'm kinda scared to say more. 

I'm starting to question everything i thought i knew about myself.

How the hell am i going to bring up this whole attraction subject? I really do not want to offend him (or anyone else for that matter).
I'm sorry if i've worded things wrong, my English isn't that good.

2017-07-04 12:07:32,6l6onf,13,7,"Hello,
I hope I'm not intruding/being offensive by asking this, I'd just like to broaden my understanding of gender issues. My fianc√©(MTF, male pronouns ATM) came out to me as trans last year and since then, I've learned a lot about gender issues in order to support him through his transition and understand more about how he feels. However, his emotional perception of gender is a very binary view: male, or female (part of this is his fear of hormones changing him enough he doesn't look like his natal gender, but not enough to look his actual gender). As a result of learning some stuff from him, I feel I have as much of an understanding of that aspect of being transgender as is possible, given that I am cisgender. However, I have many gaps. 

In a way, viewing things from a binary perspective is more simple. If you're unhappy with your natal gender, then transition to living as the opposite gender. I can begin to guess at how this might feel. One of my friends is nb and they realised this after they began transitioning and realised that presenting as female didn't feel right either and they liked the small changes brought about by hormones in the early stage that game them a body that wasn't strictly male nor female. This sentiment is sort of echoed by the word ""nonbinary"". It isn't defined by what it is, but by what it isn't: neither male nor female. It's like the concept of cold, cold doesn't exist, only a lack of heat. 

From speaking to my fianc√©, it is clear to me that he feels not just a dislike of his male features, but also an overwhelming wanting of female features. He has been happier since starting to see changes of HRT, not just because of relief of the removal/minimisation of male features, but also a feeling of rightness of the growing female features. 

I'm probably not making much sense. I suppose what I'm asking is ""what does being non-binary mean to you? Do you feel defined by a lack of gender, or something else? How did you know you were non binary?"".

2017-07-09 09:59:27,6m6p77,13,20,"Hello everyone ! Sorry for the rant, it might be a bit too long and messy but I really need to talk about it right now.

Where do I start ?

Most of the times, I feel ""female"" or, at least, I'm not bothered by my body and I can go on with my daily life without any problems. I have bought feminine clothing, have a wardrobe full of dresses and skirt and cute cleavage tops. I like to feel sexy and beautiful. I like my curves and my long hair and wear makeup.

But sometimes... It's the contrary. It happened several times on my life, periods where I would feel more male and these periods could last many months to one year, I think. During these times, I bought clothing from the boy stores, bought binders and wanted to present and be seen as male (even though I didn't say anything about it so no pronouns or short hair or anything, it was just how I felt in my brain and I was happy with every steps I took to look more masculine.)

I am in one of those ""phase"" right now, it has been like this for ... 3 weeks I think ? I don't really now what started it (I never knew). 

I'm thinking of cutting my hair short. I'd never done that and I'm SO scared because I don't want to regret it later - as I seem to be running in and out of phases, what will I think of myself when I won't have this desir to look male again ? I'm sure I'm gonna cry about my lost long hair. But in the meantime - when I look at the mirror now, I can't see ""myself"". I don't... I don't know how to say this. It's like I'm looking at a picture on a magazine. Like ""yeah these hairs look great on that face but whatever these are not mines"". I already cut like 10cm to see if a fresh new cut would change my mind, but no. 

I'm also beginning to hate my chest again. I have a big cup (34C) and even with a binder on, it's not awesomly flat like I would want it. I'm also hating on my curves (54kg for 1m60) that make me look feminine even though I wear boy clothes - or I would need to wear baggy ones and I don't like that, plus they look shitty on me because I'm short. Frankly, right now, I'd have to have them gone. 

I'm also concerned by my height. I'm so fucking short there's no way I could pass as male - or maybe a fifteen y.o. boy, ahah. That's bugging me a lot. I tried to wear insoles lifts when I went out three days ago and the feeling was fantastic but I had to take them off because it hurt my foot. The euphoria was gone.

Also, when I was a child, I was always with boys and girls found me strange haha (not sure if that's relevant). I had a hard time during college to fit in. During high school, I felt out of place too. All the time. Felt like a zombie... After high school, I think I learned how to be ""pretty"" in a girl way and that made everything easier (felt accepted by other and there was no bullying anymore). I learned how to look and act to feel like I was like the other - not left alone.

And about my body...
Yesterday, I was talking with my girlfriend through messages and she teased me like ""i want to touch your breasts/belly"" and I just... Started crying and I think I let out all of that stress from the last weeks. Going to try boy clothes that doesn't fit even in the XS size the same day sure didn't helped me either. 

My GF herself says that she feels more masculine and wears boy clothes and such, too.

What I'm wondering is...

Am I feeling like this because I am influenced by her ? (But I had theses phases during years before, so... ?)
Did I start crying because I didn't want her to touch my ""girl"" body or my ""fat"" body ? (I want to loose weight...)

I've gone trough my old clothes recently and seen all my dresses. I remember how pretty I was in a dress, and how pretty I could be in a dress. I know I get dysphoric wearing one, but I can't stop wondering if I still should try to be a woman. I want to look attractive. Also I feel attractive in a dress. It's just that it always feels like a show, and I'm tired of people believing in that show. I've tried on some dresses with my binder, and it really helps with the body dysphoria. It's a shame that most dresses have such an open neckline that they don't really work with binders. At one point of my life I wore womens' suits because I was too dysphoric for dresses. I could't do that any more. 

I've never tried on a (proper size) men's suit. The idea of having a suit is somewhat intriguing, but as I'm pre T I'm just terrified because I know I would just look like a woman in a suit, a butch lesbian, and a 12 year old chubby boy because of my soft skin, chubby cheeks and curves in the wrong places. I'm 29 and athletic feminine gay/pansexual man/non binary (?). I don't want to look like a chubby 12 year old boy or butch lesbian. The idea of wearing a suit just feels so uncomfortable.

Maybe it's just because I've been trying to repress my feelings for so long that I still feel shame for wearing a suit. I feel just so stupid, because I know many of my female (?) friend also wear men's suits or part of men's suits. I also can't stop wondering if I'm not really trans. 

Also the approach: ""you do you, wear what makes you comfortable"" isn't really helping, because wearing a dress makes me dysphoric because of my body and because everyone assumes I'm a feminine woman. Wearing a suit could be better regards to the body dysphoria, but it still accentuates all the details that show I don't have the body made for a men's suit, and uncomfortable because I assume I look fat and ugly.

Now, for like the last 5 years or so, the main thing that's been keeping me from living as myself full time has just been fear about being out at work, and in my professional life in general.

Many of them follow my twitter, and I've been quietly out on twitter for a while now with no notable consequences.

2017-07-12 09:14:19,6msste,4,11,"am i nonbinary/agender? sorry this post is long. also sorry if i'm ignorant. i really don't know a lot about this.

I've always carried around this feeling of being drastically different from other girls, and not in a cool YA fiction novel way. I feel it in a bad way, like i'm not good enough to be a girl. 
When i was young i didn't entirely believe i was a girl, i felt alienated from them but saw the possibility of me being a boy as a bad thing. I think i wanted to be a girl but didn't view myself as one. It wasn't until i got my period that i fully believed i was genetically female. Also, sometimes i wonder if i was a hermaphrodite. I would understand if my parents hid this information from me as they are very conservative. As a kid i couldn't relate to other girls and in my more recent years I've seen myself as not enough of a girl, like too inadequate to be one.   

I've always felt alienated from other girls/girl stereotypes. I've never fully understood makeup or fashion, and i often feel insecure about my femininity. That being said I feel insecure about my masculinity, too. That may sound weird. What I mean is I feel a need to be tougher and reject girlish traits, to obtain respect from others, but primarily men. Female gender roles disgust me and make me feel nauseated at times. I hate them. The small stuff about looking good i like, but don't understand. But the other imposed female roles of inferiority and sexualization make me very upset. I hate them so much. My father had anger issues, and often called me little girl as an insult. this, I think, may have created the pressure I put on myself to reject these roles, as I know in my mind (and i hate to say this, though I know it's just how society has molded me) I really do view women as weaker and inferior, and resent that i am viewed and treated as such.  I don't want people to think about the fact that i'm a female when i'm talking to them. I want to be treated like a man, but not be a man. If i had a penis i'd be miserable, i don't identify as a man. Really, I just don't want to be viewed and treated as a woman, just as a person. I don't want people to think about my gender when they talk to me. I often wish that gender did not exist, and feel that humanity would be so much better if gender just didn't exist. If we still had different biological sexes, but didn't acknowledge it, and just defined people as people, never distinguishing them with genders. 

 I worry that identifying as agender or nonbinary will make it harder to get boys to like me. Im pansexual, but with a strong romantic preference for men. sorry i know this sounds so shitty.

I do feel like I don't have a gender, but at the same time i think maybe i could just choose to identify as a girl. I just don't understand what I am. The more I think about it, the more i really do feel like i don't have a gender. I also remember reading something in the bible that kinda says gender isn't real, which validates it more for my kind of religious self. I see other kids my age (pretty much all biologically female) who are trans, typically to identify as boys or nonbinary. Anyways, i see these kids, and I feel like they haven't researched it at all, and that it may be the result of internalized sexism, which i regretfully experience. (We are sophomores in hs) I don't want to be like these kids. I want to just know what i am so i can carry on. The teenage years seem kinda crucial into developing into who you are, and i don't wanna squander them by not knowing who i am. 

I also have done this thing for a while where in my head i refer to myself as my parent‚Äôs son. I am very quiet and distant around them, and i feel like they are currently disappointed that i'm so abnormal. that i'm not just a regular girl. I often feel inadequate and ashamed for not being able to just be a regular girl. 

So uh, to restate some points: i feel different from girls, like im not good enough to be one of them. At the same time, i often resent being viewed as a girl, i sometimes view them as inferior and don't like being lumped in with them. Im not uncomfortable with my body. Im good with having boobs, but i like the idea of binding them down occasionally. I view the word girl as a compliment or an insult, depending on the context. If it's a hot person, it's a compliment. Like they‚Äôre pretending i'm better than i actually am. If it's my parents or a teacher i really respect, it feels demeaning, even wrong and rude. 

I‚Äôd like any advice, please tell me what you think.  I just want to know who I am, or steps I could take towards figuring it out. Gender therapy isn't an option for me, my religious conservative parents would never let me, and freak out about me even considering it. So please, any input is appreciated. also im really sorry i feel like i sound like huge sexist jerk by saying all this stuff. ",NonBinary,am i nonbinary/agender? or do i just hate myself?,1499876059.0,"{'created_utc': 1499850859, 'id': '6msste', 'num_comments': 4, 'score': 11, 'selftext': ""am i nonbinary/agender? sorry this post is long. also sorry if i'm ignorant. i really don't know a lot about this.\n\nI've always carried around this feeling of being drastically different from other girls, and not in a cool YA fiction novel way. I feel it in a bad way, like i'm not good enough to be a girl. \nWhen i was young i didn't entirely believe i was a girl, i felt alienated from them but saw the possibility of me being a boy as a bad thing. I think i wanted to be a girl but didn't view myself as one. It wasn't until i got my period that i fully believed i was genetically female. Also, sometimes i wonder if i was a hermaphrodite. I would understand if my parents hid this information from me as they are very conservative. As a kid i couldn't relate to other girls and in my more recent years I've seen myself as not enough of a girl, like too inadequate to be one.   \n\nI've always felt alienated from other girls/girl stereotypes. I've never fully understood makeup or fashion, and i often feel insecure about my femininity. That being said I feel insecure about my masculinity, too. That may sound weird. What I mean is I feel a need to be tougher and reject girlish traits, to obtain respect from others, but primarily men. Female gender roles disgust me and make me feel nauseated at times. I hate them. The small stuff about looking good i like, but don't understand. But the other imposed female roles of inferiority and sexualization make me very upset. I hate them so much. My father had anger issues, and often called me little girl as an insult. this, I think, may have created the pressure I put on myself to reject these roles, as I know in my mind (and i hate to say this, though I know it's just how society has molded me) I really do view women as weaker and inferior, and resent that i am viewed and treated as such.  I don't want people to think about the fact that i'm a female when i'm talking to them. I want to be treated like a man, but not be a man. If i had a penis i'd be miserable, i don't identify as a man. Really, I just don't want to be viewed and treated as a woman, just as a person. I don't want people to think about my gender when they talk to me. I often wish that gender did not exist, and feel that humanity would be so much better if gender just didn't exist. If we still had different biological sexes, but didn't acknowledge it, and just defined people as people, never distinguishing them with genders. \n\n I worry that identifying as agender or nonbinary will make it harder to get boys to like me. Im pansexual, but with a strong romantic preference for men. sorry i know this sounds so shitty.\n\nI do feel like I don't have a gender, but at the same time i think maybe i could just choose to identify as a girl. I just don't understand what I am. The more I think about it, the more i really do feel like i don't have a gender. I also remember reading something in the bible that kinda says gender isn't real, which validates it more for my kind of religious self. I see other kids my age (pretty much all biologically female) who are trans, typically to identify as boys or nonbinary. Anyways, i see these kids, and I feel like they haven't researched it at all, and that it may be the result of internalized sexism, which i regretfully experience. (We are sophomores in hs) I don't want to be like these kids. I want to just know what i am so i can carry on. The teenage years seem kinda crucial into developing into who you are, and i don't wanna squander them by not knowing who i am. \n\nI also have done this thing for a while where in my head i refer to myself as my parent‚Äôs son. I am very quiet and distant around them, and i feel like they are currently disappointed that i'm so abnormal. that i'm not just a regular girl. I often feel inadequate and ashamed for not being able to just be a regular girl. \n\nSo uh, to restate some points: i feel different from girls, like im not good enough to be one of them.

I'm a binary guy but fully supportive of NB folks. My partner's gender is very fluid, on the other hand, and I'm having trouble showing support. Not because I don't want to be, but because I don't know how and when I ask my partner is not sure. My attempts to be supportive usually result in arguments and frustration. I obviously have no idea how to show support and am screwing up all over the place, so I need guidance. 

Sometimes their presentation is very femme, sometimes andro, never really ""masculine."" They identify as male most of the time but other times say they don't care or don't really have an opinion on what they are. I've asked before if any specific gender identity matches up, so I can research that and get a better idea as my partner more or less just shrugs when I ask about it and doesn't know how to put it into words, but they don't like any of the terms like pangender/bigender/agender/etc. because they don't care for labels. I'm still holding out hope they'll find a label they do like because then I would be able to read and figure out how they feel; even after a few years they don't know how to explain. Even when I ask if they're nonbinary the response is either ""yes,"" ""probably"" or ""nah.""

For example, I took my partner to the mall to get some new clothes as they had lost some weight and wanted a reward. They got all ""women's"" clothes. When I complimented their picks and said they were very nice, they got quiet and sort of shut down. In the car on the way home, they said they were worried I wanted them to ""stay a woman"" because I thought the clothes they picked out were nice and hadn't encouraged them to get ""men's"" clothes. I reassured them that that was not at all the case, and that I thought they looked nice in everything they wear.

Fast-forward to a shopping trip a couple of weeks after that. Partner said they wanted to get some tank tops. I had to go to the ""men's"" section anyway so I picked up a pack there. I showed them to my partner and asked if they were good. Their eyes narrowed and he said ""why would you want me to get men's tanks?"" I was a little bewildered since just before that they had been upset with me for NOT suggesting masc clothes, and this was my attempt to show support for their fluidity. I dropped it and got them ""women's"" tanks instead, but they were irritated about it for the rest of the day.

I guess I just don't know how to show support to someone who is this fluid. What's also complicating things is that because I'm only attracted to my partner and no one else, my sexuality tends to swing towards however they're presenting. According to them I seem ""gayer"" when they're more masc-leaning and ""straighter"" when they're more femme-leaning. Which does make sense and I think that stresses them out. My sexuality is as fluid as their gender. On the other hand my gender is not fluid at all, and their sexuality isn't fluid at all either, so I think that lends to us having trouble understanding each other.

I'm Jeremy, I run a Discord server for trans/gender non-conforming individuals. You might be thinking ""Well, there are a lot of trans servers. What makes this one different?"". I think our trans server stands out because we're all very welcoming and eager to add new friends into the fold. We accept anyone regardless of gender identity, progress in transition, or presentation. 

We have a lot of channels set up to discuss various topics! Many of us are avid gamers and our server even has it's own Minecraft (Peaceful/Vanilla) server to play on. 

On top of the channels to discuss everyday topics or niche interests, we also have support channels. Many of our members are willing to open their ears to you or possibly even assist you with an issue you may have. Of course, we also have rooms for your specific gender identity (transfemme, transmasc, non-binary). 

We currently have more younger members than older ones and we'd love some older trans people. &lt;3

If you don't know what Discord is, check out https://discordapp.com/ . Discord is a voice and text chat program a bit like skype typically geared towards gamers but that's definitely not it's only use. People have servers set up from topics varying from trans servers to servers for TV shows.

I had no body dysphoria or anything like that. I hated dresses and the colour pink. But I get that you can be all that and still feel female. My problem is that I don't feel comfortable with that, but I also don't feel male. I sometimes I feel wearing a dress (I sort of don't hate them anymore most of the time), but it's rare and I usually prefer jeans/trousers and t-shirts. I usually shop at the women's clothe section but occasionally I also shop in the men's section, and I never care of shoes are for men or women. Also, my ideal body (for myself) is defined muscles, specially the arms, and as flat a chess a women can get without surgery or binding (working on it) and short hair. I rarely wear any kind of make up besides sometimes  lipstick. hell, I use high heals more often than make up and that happens with as much frequency as a plane crash. 
Here in the thing though, I don't feel quite comfortable identifying as female, but I also don't feel comfortable identifying as gender neutral or non-binary because I feel somewhere in between those, which is ridiculous because you're supposed to define a label, not the other way around. I feel like, because I'm close to feeling female I don't deserve to use the non-binary label and I've never felt affinity towards queergender. Also, I live in Mexico and my first language is Spanish, which has no neutrality in anything, even inanimate objects have gender, so I feel lost.
Anyone else feels like that or am I just drowning in a glass of water?

So, my first question: I'll have until January 23 before I'm back in classes and living that student life, but I'll need to fly from Orlando to Chicago on January 10. I can pack minimally, or keep everything in a roll-on suitcase, whatever is best. How late do you think I can get the surgery and still be okay to travel? Anywhere before December 29/30 gets really tricky because I have family coming to the US from Europe and we never see them, so I need to be around‚Ä¶but I've heard 2-3 weeks is standard before returning to a desk job, so I'm really pushing it. Winter break is the only time before summer 2018 when I can get the surgery without missing weeks of school, and I want to be fully recovered by summer because my sister is getting married. I have a very important meeting on the morning of January 11, 2018 that will last about an hour, but I'll just be sitting there. Thoughts?

Second question: My full legal name is Caroline. I've been going by Cara for 5 years, but as I feel more masculine I start to feel like Cara is too feminine. I've been playing with Chase as a nickname for Charles, since Charles is how my parents came up with Caroline (Charles is a family name). But Charles is super masculine and Chase is decently masculine, and I'm not sure if I want to go through the hassle of asking everyone to call me a different name. A few people have been calling me Chase at my request, and I really like it. My question is, which name strikes you as more gender-neutral: Cara, or Chase?

I welcome your honest thoughts. Just typing up my top surgery woes is making me anxious, but I have to make it work somehow. Thanks for listening.

(EDIT: I cross-posted in /r/ftm and someone asked when my winter break started, thinking I could get the surgery earlier, which isn't something I'd considered. My break could begin as early as December 18 or as late as December 21, depending on when my finals are.

I disliked doing my hair, wearing makeup, and even more, I DESPISED my boobs and still do. Bras are like torture devices. I always liked dresses and super girly clothes though. Anyway, I eventually stopped caring about gender roles and all that and just started being myself slowly. I quit wearing the little makeup I had and am now all natural. Then, I cut my hair super short. Now, I don't even shave at all. I'm happier being this way, but people often think I'm a tomboy or being Androgynous, which makes me question myself for answers.

I don't really know where I stand. I know I'm definitely NOT male. And I'm not quite female either. Sure, I love cute things and my favorite color is pink, but everything else doesn't quite fit. If I could be a perfect version of myself, I'd have a completely flat chest, ether female or no genitals at all and wear lacy dresses everyday with boxers or shorts underneath.

Growing up, my parents encouraged me to develop my individuality from a very young age. I pursued whatever interested me, whether it conformed to traditional gender roles or not. I had a vague impression that some things were ‚Äúforbidden‚Äù to me because I was a girl, but my gender didn‚Äôt influence the way I saw myself for the most part.

When I was seven, my parents and I moved to another country, and the culture shock, homesickness, and stress of moving made me very insecure. I began behaving and presenting very femininely in order to ward off my poor self esteem and negative body image.¬†

Many things changed while we were gone, and once we returned home, I felt out of place once more. I wanted to be graceful and elegant, but I wore baggy, androgynous clothing in a futile attempt to conceal my insecurities. I wanted my body to develop in a feminine manner, but once it did, I was too awkward to talk to my parents about it, and they were too awkward to talk to me either. Consequently, I began to associate my female anatomy with shame, secrecy, and distress, feelings which persist years later.¬†

I met my girlfriend (who‚Äôs MtF) when we were fourteen. Before she began transitioning, I automatically took the submissive, traditionally feminine role in our relationship, but now I naturally gravitate towards a more masculine role. I realize that not all relationships require the traditional masculine-feminine dynamic, and ours certainly doesn‚Äôt conform to ‚Äútraditional‚Äù standards. Yet, her transition prompted me to reevaluate my identity, and I‚Äôm beginning to realize how many parts of myself don‚Äôt exactly fit within the gender binary: partaking in ultrafeminine things like putting on makeup induce a feeling of intense wrongness that borders on dysphoria; I dress androgynously as much as I can, and I prefer to dress as male characters for Halloween/ComicCon; and although I enjoy working with little kids, the notion of my own potential maternity seems strangely foreign and wrong.¬†

I know that I‚Äôm not a trans man, and I‚Äôm fairly sure that I don‚Äôt quite count as a cis woman. I get a warm, fuzzy feeling whenever I think of myself as a nonbinary person. It just feels somehow *right*. Yet, I fear that I don‚Äôt fulfill many of the traits associated with nonbinary identities either. I don‚Äôt mind having a feminine body, and I don‚Äôt expect that I will ever want to pursue a medical transition in any capacity. Female pronouns don‚Äôt bother me, although I mostly use them for convenience rather than because I feel some profound connection to them. My name is quite feminine, and I don't want to change it either. Most troubling, I still have severe anxiety and self esteem problems, and I fear this might be just another coping mechanism. I genuinely can‚Äôt tell if I actually belong in the nonbinary community, or I‚Äôm just a confused cis person who‚Äôs trying to be more ‚Äúspecial‚Äù than they actually are.¬†

I'll be going to university in another country soon, so I'll have the opportunity to change the way people perceive me, and I'm not sure how I want to present. I'll likely still dress androgynously, but should I actually come out to people there if I'm still not sure? I don't know. 

I‚Äôve told my girlfriend and one of my closest friends about my concerns, and they‚Äôre both immensely supportive and understanding.I‚Äôm immensely grateful to have such a wonderful support system, but frankly all this is still somewhat overwhelming.

2017-07-28 08:57:37,6q2lu8,12,9,"Hello, I'm pretty new here so bare with me on my first post. If you'd wish to not read all of this my questions will be at the very bottom.

I've identified as non-binary for a good while now, and overall it has served me well. I don't see myself as a transgender man, or a cis woman, so it's the closest way to label what I feel. However, ever since I've come onto this realization, I've been finding it harder and harder to tell people that I am non-binary. It's also something I don't bring up at all until someone asks me.

Because of this, I've learned to deal with being misgendered, and the dysphoria it brings. I don't get mad or upset at people for doing this given that it's my own burden to deal with. Regardless, it does hurt. And it's always a challenge for me to come out and tell them about my identity.

I'm convinced that my reason for doing this to myself is because over last few years I feel like the term has become a joke to most people. I'm embarrassed that I'm like this. I wake up so many mornings and just ask myself why can't I be in one of the binaries? I tried for a time to go as trans and fell into a deep depression. And even now that I know I'm NB, I'm still convinced that no one takes me seriously. That they just see some special snowflake who's trying to make up for a lack of personality. But that's not the case at all...

Just as well, I can never vent to my friends who are also NB or transgender. Those who are NB are usually very feminine (I guess I fit more with masculine but I don't ever see that myself) and are okay with the things I'm uncomfortable with. And I feel like I have no right to complain to trans people because they have to go through so much more than I do. So I've never really had a person to talk to about all of this.

I hate being this confused and frustrated with myself all the time. I want to be normal, or at the very least fit into a binary that people understand. But I can't... I tried and I don't want to do that to myself again. 

Is there anyone out there who feels as though they never get taken seriously for their identity? What ways can I over come this feeling and just accept myself? 

Thank you for your time, it means a lot to me.
