This next part needs a pretext- my husband is not out yet so he will be referred to as male in my post. 
My husband has come out to me and my brother as trans as well. He’s working very hard to drop weight (and doing a fantastic job!) before he starts HRT and eventually goes through SRS. I’ve been shamed online before for considering him a male but for now, he is, so please don’t go there with me. 

Here’s my part of the story-
I’ve always been agender. I didn’t know until my brother came out that that’s the word for how I feel. I’ve always gone by my assigned pronouns because I thought that’s what everyone was supposed to do. I was raised with the impression that a “sex change” is a thing of comedy, not shameful but mostly the butt of a joke. So I am me with my birth given body, but I don’t have to be. 

Two of the closest people to me in my life are going through very huge transitions and I’m over here wanting to be neutral. I don’t want it to seem like I’m trying to get attention. I don’t want to come off as a sheep following my family herd. My birth given name can be shortened to a gender neutral nick name that a lot of people call me already, so I do not want to change my name. I am still debating on if I want to go by neutral pronouns. I prefer they/them but I have a hard enough time myself with automatically gendering strangers (it’s a habit I’m working diligently to break) and I don’t like holding others to standards I can’t even meet. 

So here I am, trying to find myself. If anyone else is going through a similar journey to mine I’d love to hear about it. 

For what it’s worth, we have a child, may or may not have more, and I’m 28 years old. Better late than never? Haha

tldr: I am non binary, currently going by my assigned pronouns, debating on how I want to present myself moving forward because I’ve lived so long as my assigned gender and I’m okay-enough with it, but would prefer neutral. My biggest hold up currently is not wanting to steal the thunder of my newly out and still not out trans family members.

I was wondering if anyone else has experiences with hormone treatments or hormonal birth control and can speak to its effects on non-binary identity?

I'm AFAB, queer and NB, and in the past I took hormonal birth control a few times. Even at very low doses, I found that the hormones seemed to have an impact on my identity. As I was taking more female hormones, my presentation and even my thoughts seemed more ""feminine"". 

It was actually very traumatic for me as I found I wasn't acting like myself and I didn't like the person I had become. I'm wondering if this is a common experience or if others have had different experiences with this.

My department regularly interacts with a few non-binary students aside from me.

One thing they came up with was putting an additional line in the official department policy regarding the ""right for students to be referred to by their preferred pronouns.""

I would swing wildly from preferring pink polkadot frilly dresses and took ballet and had to have perfect hair, to only wearing boots and jeans with unkempt short hair and played soccer and tried to get my mom to let me try football with the guys.

I began wondering why I didn't have a penis as a young teen and wanting one, somewhere age 12-14, but I had no clue that other females didn't have the same thoughts and feelings. I thought it was like wishing for a unicorn, better to wish for a horse. 

I had sexual fantasies in which I was a guy, getting girls pregnant, and I never said anything because I thought every girl thought this way, and never said anything because, well, who talks about their sexual fantasies?

Remember, this is the 1980s, and no one had ever heard of non-binary trans. I was in the San Francisco area, and even there it wasn't a thing. Trans guys weren't even a thing! It was just trans girls. Period.

My husband began suggesting I try testosterone as long as 20 years ago. And would bring it up every once in a while when I was being particularly masc.

I really don't know what to do about honorifics.. tbh I kinda don't like any of them. I'm maybe leaning a little bit toward ""Ind."" - looks good to me on paper, except, it doesn't seem like it works very well in speech either.. ""Ind. Jones?"" ""Individual Jones?"" Neither sounds quite right to me...

Iono. Anyone else still struggling with finding pronouns and/or honorifics they like? Even after reading lists of them after lots of Googling?

(As for pronouns, I'm starting to adopt ""they/them"". But I do find it has slight grammatical issues with possible obscurity (""they told them what they had heard from their other friend""), which wouldn't be much of an issue at all with things like xe/xer, except those ones, to me, suffer the different problem of sounding a bit new and tacky.)

I'm at least glad I think I may have sorted out my name at least though now. I've taken the spelling/pronunciation of the first letter of my (male) given name as my new given name, and using my middle name as my last name. Comes out as something I think I'm satisfied with.

2017-10-09 05:51:44,7574zq,3,4,"Recently I have done a lot of thinking about the types of dysphoria I have experienced in my life so far as an AFAB gender non binary individual. I'm curious how much of my experience you guys relate to, or if you have stuff to add!

I have personally experienced two completely separate subcategories of gender dysphoria throughout my lifetime. I have not been able to find previously coined words for them, so I am creating my own descriptive terms. Intrinsic physical dysphoria, and extrinsic emotional dysphoria


The first type of dysphoria is something I’ll call intrinsic physical dysphoria. It is the discomfort associated with a person’s physical body not matching their own internal sense of gender. I call it intrinsic because it was completely fuelled by my own internal discomfort with my female body and the knowledge of the future implications of puberty. It started for me when I was around 12 years old, and I had a lot of trouble explaining at the time why I didn’t want to have boobs or why the thought of menstruation basically terrified me. It went much further than being nervous about the changes of puberty; the problem was that my hormones were going to take my body in the opposite direction than I wanted it to go. I wanted more muscle and a more masculine frame! I was able to correct a large portion of this type of dysphoria by strength training and gaining muscle mass.

Dysphoria is a difficult thing to explain to people who have never experienced it. It’s a very generalized feeling of discomfort with yourself, and there are going to be different triggers of it for everyone. We hear so frequently of it in the context of individuals who are transgendered, in that they feel like they were born in the wrong body. Where my experience as a non binary individual is that my body just had a few tweaks necessary in order for me to be happy and content with it. I currently have no residual intrinsic physical dysphoria, other than those few days a year that my (already quite small) breasts feel just a little bit too large. I’ve almost completely been able to take charge of it.


The second type of dysphoria I’ll call extrinsic emotional dysphoria. It is the discomfort associated with being continuously told that you should behave a certain gendered way, but this attitude conflicts with your own internal gender identity. It is very different from the intrinsic physical dysphoria, because this type is caused by the words and expectations of other people. The unfortunate fact is that many people are very uncomfortable with individuals whose apparent sex and gender identities do not match. Imagine the funny looks that a man wearing a dress would get, or a woman with hairy legs. I call it being “gender corrected”; where people try to coach you through life, telling you what you need to change about your gender presentation in order to be perceived as normal. Some of this is well intentioned and some of it isn’t, but the fact is that all of it fuels extrinsic emotional dysphoria. You feel like you only have two options in life. Either you conform to what other people expect and be miserable yourself, or you present your true self to the world and face all the judgement associated with it. I have unquestioningly chosen the second option; but it isn’t an easy road. It is a road filled with emotional turmoil, feeling like a misfit, constantly wondering what others think of you, and then being glad that you can’t read their minds. Because they probably think you’re a weirdo too, just like all the other people seem to.

I’ve always been quite a self-confident person, but I’ve found that over the years it gets harder to retain your self-confidence the more that people act like your gender identity is weird. Unfortunately for us nonbinary individuals, we can’t change our internal feelings to make them match with the expectations of society. We can’t change the fact that our society is a very gender binary one, and as such it tends to be confused by people like us. It’s OK to be confused by other people who are different from you, but what’s not OK is making them feel like outsiders or second class citizens. They are people just like you who deserve respect! 

Being gender non binary is basically a compounded problem. You’ve got your own intrinsic discomfort because your body may not match your own internal sense of gender. Then you’ve got the extrinsic issues related to other people trying to tell you how to express your gender. It isn’t an easy life to live. I love my life so much, but it would be dishonest with myself to not admit the extra challenges that being nonbinary has added to my life.

Hi, I am nonbinary. I was assigned male at birth but I've always identified with feminine identities so identify as trans-femme. I formally came to this realisation over the summer and am struggling to find validity in my everyday life. I go to a fairly progressive Christian college, but there is still little support for LGBTQ+ individuals so I feel unsafe presenting on the more feminine end of the spectrum. My parents have made themselves pretty clear on where they stand in their beliefs about gender, so I haven't told them and I don't know how I ever will. So whenever I interact with my parents on breaks and during the summer I have to pretend to be cishet and it gives me dysphoria to the point of wanting to throw up and I start to cry when I hear their voices on the phone because not being able to be my true self around them is so painful. My girlfriend is very supportive and we've been working together to figure out small things we can do to help diminish my dysphoria, but hiding from my parents is a large road block. I've been trying to subtly incorporate femme elements into my fashion, but I don't have a lot of money and the thrift stores in town are really crappy and I have no idea how to re purpose my masc clothes to help me feel more feminine. I started wearing makeup over the summer but I've gotten a lot of shit for that on campus.

2017-10-12 00:45:51,75thus,4,1,"The NPR Hidden Brain podcast's most recent episode, ""Edge of Gender"", focuses on the biology versus socialization debate around gender.  It ends with a segment on Jamie Shupe, a nonbinary person who has been fighting for legal recognition of nonbinary gender (they have won a court case recognizing it).

If you've listened to this podcast, what are your thoughts?

I was bothered by how the host said that Jamie's pronouns were they/them but then never used their pronoun.  Every single reference to Jamie referenced them by name rather than pronoun.  It is very noticeable given it's awkwardness of repeating their name over and over again.  (Also the a notably awkward phrasing that Jamie doesn't want to be ""a he or a she but a they"" that evokes a strange othering, since there is no such thing as ""a"" he/she/they but a man, woman, nonbinary person.)  

My bigger issue is that the podcast ends with some rather transphobic positions that the host says Jamie holds, and since Jamie is the sole nonbinary person represented in the whole podcast, it potentially leaves listeners generalizing these views to all nonbinary people.  In contrast, the podcast represents multiple proponents on the two sides of the biology/socialization debate.  I think I'm going to write to the podcast producers regarding these issues.

This post is a twofold question:  
1. What religions do y'all follow, if any?  Did discovering that you are nonbinary change your cosmic perspective?  
2. Have you read anything interesting about the convergence of nonbinary people and religion?  If so, please share.

1. I was raised Protestant but now consider myself agnostic/atheist. (""Spiritual but not religious"" sorta fits, but I'm not particularly fond of the term.)

2017-10-15 05:19:34,76h7d0,10,13,"Hey everyone. Sometimes it's easy to feel alone on this. I have a small group of friends who know I'm nonbinary and a supportive SO who doesn't feel very binary himself sometimes, and online friends too...but even with those it can be so hard, especially at work. I'm currently a cashier and I'm hoping to become an illustrator in time, but for now all I can do is go by my chosen name, Aeron, and dress leaning a bit masculine(I'm AFAB). It does confuse people sometimes, but my voice always is a dead giveaway. I fall into the habit of pitching it up even higher unintentionally when trying to be friendly to customers, and it sounds all singsong-y too. So people usually end up going, ""hey girl!"" and ""ma'am"" at me and it sucks.

I'm still too scared to tell any of my managers because I don't think any of them would get it. The only person I kinda came out to was my customer service supervisor, who's gay and has friends who are all over the place with gender expression. Unfortunately I didn't have time to really talk to him about it, and he still calls me she. 

I know there's nothing I can do to stop it all. I realized going on T probably won't really be worth it, because sometimes I have anxiety of kids getting super confused at me. It sounds silly, I know. I should be happy people get confused but when kids ask their parents if I'm a boy or a girl, or worse, they ask me, I get scared and I don't know how to answer. I know if I were on T this would be tenfold, and also...I'd probably start to be called a man all the time. There's also a few other reasons I hesitate to start hormones. I guess I'd like to check out other ways, first.

Gahh, I'm sorry, this is so all over the place. I guess it's mostly just venting. I wish there was more I could do. I do look pretty androgynous but my voice just...does this all the time. I probably sound really feminine to people and it makes me so uncomfortable. Today this old guy just walked up to me and was rubbing my shoulder very slowly, and it was creepy. People still see me as female and treat me however they want sometimes.

I'm not even sure what I'm asking. I guess I wanna know what I can do to help this without going on T. At least I have small breasts, so binding isn't always a thing I have to do, but I do have a binder. That's all I've got going so far. Maybe I should consider gaining muscle too, but not sure where to start.

Over the past few weeks ive been sending them information, reenforcing the fact that this isn't a phase and that this *is* important to me. Last I saw my mom I asked her to use they them pronouns for me, and I shit you not, she said ""you ask too much of your old folks"" and continued to use she pronouns the rest of the weekend. Or ignored me.

I finally came across an article and video that said what I had been trying to say, but better. I sent it to them, hoping for a positive or even neutral response. Nothing. So I sent an email writing that I wanted them to use they/them pronouns, and talking about it in terms of respect. If they respect me as a person, then they should respect my choice of pronouns. My dad wrote back and said ""sorry super busy will read later."" Still nothing from Mom.

Then I get an email that is definitely not meant for me. It basically says ""wow my daughter is asking too much, I wish she would stop being a selfish bitch that spends her credit card on binders and guy clothes and would actually do something with her life. This is just a phase when will she fucking grow out of already."" Okay it didn't say exactly that (of course not my mom is one passive aggressive bitch), but that's the gist.

She never apologized that time and I don't expect one now.

My friend managed to calm me down. I was livid and then a sobbing wreck. All of this over a single fucking word.

I'm not really sure if this is the right place to post this or not but I'm not really sure where else to go and I don't really know anyone in my life who can relate. 

Quick disclaimer and a little background; everyone in my life is super accepting and awesome. I'm a bi female which I realised years ago and everyone knows; I have a gay brother and my parents are more than supportive and honestly the best parents somebody could hope for. I have a lot of gay/bi friends and honestly don't think any of my friends are homophobic or transphobic at all. However if myself or anyone in my story does come across as intolerant it's probably just confusion of the situation and a lack of knowing anyone going through a similar thing so not fully understanding. 

So recently I've been thinking i might be gender fluid. I'm super confused and have loads of questions and just thoughts and I apologise if this is just sort of ranting. 

So some background, I've always sort of been a mixture of tomboy and girly, like I've never really fit in with either. I'm not sporty or into makeup (I know these are stereotypes but it's just sort of a good example?). In high school I went through stages of loving dresses and nothing else and times when I wore nothing but men's clothing. There was definitely a year or two when I did question my gender but realised I do enjoy being a girl so I couldn't be a guy (didn't really think about other options hahah). 

So what got me thinking about it this time was about a month ago (I know it's not that long) my mum asked me about which I would chose if I could come back in another life as a male or female. She said female and I argued male, because as much as I love being a woman I'd love to see the other side of things, plus don't you have those days when you just feel like a male? She just looked at me confused and said no I don't have those days (again not judging just confused). This got me thinking about my gender for the first time in a while and I was like wait do people not have those days when they want to be a boy? I thought everyone had that. 
The next dayI had an event to go to where I needed to wear a dress and it got me all anxious and nervous and so I was messaging a friend just ranting and saying how I don't feel like wearing a dress and why are my boobs here I just want them to go away. She responded confused like what do you mean, your boobs are awesome? I said yeah some days I do really love them but I'm just having one of those times when I don't want them there at all. She was confused and saying how no she'd never felt that. I too was confused, again asking doesn't everyone just have those days and these thoughts?? 
Later that week after I'd been thinking about these things, I was dressed in baggy pants and a T with some friends who were loving how androgynous I look and I was like yeah I feel like a boy it's awesome. Then a friend said half jokingly something like 'why aren't you just non binary' and it was like everything in my life just clicked. Yes actually that does sound kind of right. That would explain a lot. Is that me? 

It explains why I have days feeling like a male when others don't feel that. Or why I feel like my breasts don't belong on my body sometimes; or why when everyone looked at models and felt bad about themselves I loved my androgynous look and didn't care for a typical female body (or one at all?) I always wanted to grow a beard, and Is my penis envy just about being able to pee wherever or is there more to it? 

I then went into full panic mode for about a week. I know nothing about this, what does it mean? Who even am I now?? 
I started reading a bunch of non binary blogs and definitions and just whatever I could find and felt like gender fluid fit me the best. Some days female, some days male, some days in between. Yep that basically sums up my whole life and why one day I hate hate hate dresses and heels and the next I'm like this is so fun I feel so fancy! 

But now I'm just sort of stuck and lost. I'm not sure what I'm meant to do now? What I'm meant to think about to know if this is right or if not why am I having these thoughts?

Everything has suddenly become harder too, a month ago I got up felt like a dress and put it on and it was great; or felt like baggy pants and an oversize shirt and loved the occasional questioning look I got. I'd be out and knew I looked like a boy but it didn't matter. Now I go out and I'm sort of trying to actually pull of being a boy, like I want people to think that and then suddenly I feel weird when people know I'm a girl, or I feel weird because I go to the female bathrooms and I'm trying to be a boy? 
In some ways it's been freeing like I've been wearing a sports bra with this singlet over and makes me so flat chested and I feel amazing, but then at the same time I'm nervous to run into somebody cos I look like a boy, even though it's exactly how I dressed before??  

I know a lot of what I've been saying has been related to clothing and I get that that isn't what defines genderqueer or trans people but it's been when getting dressed that I've felt most these things.  

Ive spoken to a couple friends who were all like yeah you're only just thinking this? (I seriously thought everyone had these thoughts and I never second guessed the actual thoughts!) 

I don't know what I'm meant to do from here either. My friends either are or will be supportive but they can only really listen not offer help. I messaged this friend of a friend who I've meet a couple times who has some genderqueer friends and she said we could all meet as a group but I'm not sure if any are (female at birth? Is that a correct term? I don't wanna be offensive and nothing against males at birth I just want somebody who fully gets everything like chest dysphoria). 
I just feel so clueless and lost. I thought I knew who I was and now I don't know how to dress myself or present myself and my anxiety is going though the roof, like it has not been this bad in two years. 
Im having so many new thoughts and feelings; the other day I was putting a skirt on and I felt like I was a boy who was dressing as a girl but wanted to dress as a girl. That's definitely a new feeling. 

I don't know if I've really asked a question or if any of this is even coherent and I'm not sure what I'm really looking for. I guess just general advice or maybe I just needed a place to let this all out. I'm not sure. But any response is appreciated and thanks so much to anyone who read all the way to the end. 
Thanks everyone for support!

2017-10-20 12:06:47,77ln7l,9,6,"Hey everyone! So basically, I want to physically transition, but I'm too scared... even in nb people I see transition, I just don't see people whose goals match my goals? It feels like nb people transition to presenting as the opposite binary gender, or so that they look gender ambiguous in a ""no visibly gendered characteristics"" way which is cool for them, but it makes me feel kind of alone.

Is there anyone out there that wants ""mixed"" gendered characteristics? Like, a ""male""-read voice and breasts? Or curves and a beard? Or anything really, that reads as visibly non-cis? If you don't feel comfortable with details, even a ""I'm like that!"" would make me feel less weird, honestly. And if you do have such traits I'd really appreciate stories about how it affects your daily life (like work and going down the shops) and country, if you're comfortable with it. Obviously things change hugely even in the same country/state depending on where you live, but it'd be nice to get some perspective.

I personally live in a pretty progressive area I believe? Australia, major city. There's even an ""X"" gender marker available! =) I probably have no right to be complaining- I'm a (young) legal adult and I live with my family who think trans people are jokes, but would never kick me out (parent knows I'm trans). But I worry about practicalities (mostly work). I'm afab, but have a (regrettably small) amount of beard hair due to the luck of genetics. Before I grew it I hated facial hair but loved it on me because it looked ""male"", and now I love facial hair, lol. I feel like it isn't noticeable *enough* but I've gotten comments from a co-worker ""politely"" telling me about her laser hair removal place, which cheers me up. As for future goals, I am genderfluid and my dysphoria shifts, but I always want a deep voice and ""downstairs"" growth. I kind of want to go on full T, then once permanent changes have happened go on low T or no T. I say kind of because I desperately want ""male"" stuff *yesterday* but I'm scared to even talk to doctors, cause of severe social anxiety and fear of regret. Being nonbinary really embarrasses me too... I'm fine talking about it on the internet, but the thought of it in real life... ugh Anyway! Chest-wise, I hate the thought of being unconscious around strangers, let alone being visibly non-cis, but if I get it I'd get a breast reduction not a removal. Even at my current size binding with a sports bra would be enough if I were more androgynous. I love colourful girly clothes and kind of hate the thought of giving up skirts and dresses since I hated them/never wore them as a kid/teen due to their ""girl"" association (not that I wear them much *now* - I'm unwilling to shave, but hairy as FUCK and embarrassed about it) but idk if I'd have the confidence to keep wearing them post-T. Doesn't help I'd probably be even hairier - I'm unwilling to shave but I'm seriously not kidding when I say I'm seriously hairy. I have feet hairs and a bit of a complex, and am scared of being ugly (if I shaved I'd be considered really attractive by woman standards, so I feel really bad about wanting to transition).

Also, does anyone know a word for this sort of transition, similar to transfeminine/transmasculine? It'd be helpful to know so I can seek out similar experiences.

But I worry about practicalities (mostly work). I\'m afab, but have a (regrettably small) amount of beard hair due to the luck of genetics. Before I grew it I hated facial hair but loved it on me because it looked ""male"", and now I love facial hair, lol. I feel like it isn\'t noticeable *enough* but I\'ve gotten comments from a co-worker ""politely"" telling me about her laser hair removal place, which cheers me up. As for future goals, I am genderfluid and my dysphoria shifts, but I always want a deep voice and ""downstairs"" growth. I kind of want to go on full T, then once permanent changes have happened go on low T or no T. I say kind of because I desperately want ""male"" stuff *yesterday* but I\'m scared to even talk to doctors, cause of severe social anxiety and fear of regret. Being nonbinary really embarrasses me too... I\'m fine talking about it on the internet, but the thought of it in real life... ugh Anyway! Chest-wise, I hate the thought of being unconscious around strangers, let alone being visibly non-cis, but if I get it I\'d get a breast reduction not a removal. Even at my current size binding with a sports bra would be enough if I were more androgynous. I love colourful girly clothes and kind of hate the thought of giving up skirts and dresses since I hated them/never wore them as a kid/teen due to their ""girl"" association (not that I wear them much *now* - I\'m unwilling to shave, but hairy as FUCK and embarrassed about it) but idk if I\'d have the confidence to keep wearing them post-T. Doesn\'t help I\'d probably be even hairier - I\'m unwilling to shave but I\'m seriously not kidding when I say I\'m seriously hairy. I have feet hairs and a bit of a complex, and am scared of being ugly (if I shaved I\'d be considered really attractive by woman standards, so I feel really bad about wanting to transition).\n\nAlso, does anyone know a word for this sort of transition, similar to transfeminine/transmasculine? It\'d be helpful to know so I can seek out similar experiences.

These past few weeks I've been seriously questioning myself in terms of gender and I'm not sure if what I've been feeling really counts as dysphoria.

Like, when I see myself in a mirror nothing about me really feels 'wrong', I'm just sort of indifferent to it. But at the same time I also sorta wish I could be more feminine. Softer skin, curvier, breasts, etc...

Even then I also enjoy some of my masculine traits and without trying to blow my own horn I think I make somewhat of a good looking guy.

I've never really been particularly masculine anyway and someone recently used a female pronoun when talking to me which made me feel quite nice.

All this being said I don't 'feel' female and I don't want to undergo a transition because I feel like I'd be committing myself to the other extreme when I don't feel like I'd get much of a benefit from it.

Is it wrong that I sorta want to be androgynous with some feminine traits? I feel that even if I'm not male, I can't really come out to my parents (I still can't admit to them that I'm bisexual).

Sorry for the wall of text but I have to ask, does anything that I've written here come of as dysphoria? I'm super confused here, and was wondering if anyone could offer any insight/ advice into exploring myself further, and finding proper answers?

2017-10-21 18:26:20,77v2rz,2,15,"Here we go again, another shift. I can't figure out if it's gender shifts for my being bi-gender, or still working out who I am.

I don't know if it makes sense, but I feel like I *am a guy* who wants to be a girl. Even though I am a physical female, raised female, lived female for 47 years, I also feel like I want to be a girl and am not. It feels so natural to switch to testosterone and get bottom surgery, etc. It feels right. But I desperately, desperately want to be a girl, I much prefer to be a girl, and I have this sense I will never be one.

Yesterday I had my first female-fail (4 months, 1 week on T). By my wife. We went out for a family dinner last night in two vehicles, and I arrived first. When my wife arrived, she looked in the window of the restaurant and could only see us from the shoulders up. She said she saw my sons sitting with another guy. She straight up didn't recognize me without my more femme body (huge boobs, femme clothes).

I thought I was fairly settled in my bi-gender identification, letting my inner femme girl and my inner masc guy each have what they need the most to be dysphoria-free.

For the last week or so I've been considering a full transition (not the first time). I want to be a guy, physically, but my femme side is very adamant that I don't want to look like a guy. I want a flat chest. I want full bottom surgery (meta) to be fully a guy inside my pants. 

Yet the other part of me still wants to be all girl. I want to keep my inner lady parts, a sexually functional vagina, I want to keep my boobs (and even get a lift so they're perky and pretty again without assistance from a bra). I want to wear my pretty skirts and tops and my (obsessively assembled) dangly earring collection. But I can't figure out if that side of me really wants these things, or if I just don't want to give up my cis privilege and deal with the social ramifications.

So my female fail had me looking in the mirror, looking for what my wife saw. And I saw it. First, I don't really like what the male me looks like. Partly he looks too much like my bio-father (long story there), and partly he's just not how I see myself as a guy. I'm unconventionally pretty as a girl, but as a guy, ugh.  But he's growing on me, and more and more I see myself heading in that direction.

I'm not androgynous. Not at all. I do not even want to try an androgynous look. I'm really, really binary for a non-binary person. I don't like to mix them in a way to cause people to see me in that way, because I don't see me that way. 

If I could, I'd deep-six my masc side in a heartbeat so I can be all girl, all the time. I mostly identify with my female side, despite identifying with guys more than girls in general. I feel like I'm one of them, but my heroes and role models are female figures, - mostly gender non-conforming female role models.

2017-10-22 01:08:22,77xbfd,47,12,"EDIT: I changed the terminology in the post, though I unfortunately could not change the post title.

Hello, everyone. This is my first time on Reddit in several months, mostly because while the site's user base is too diverse to be stereotyped accurately, I kept either getting into fights or witnessing fights regardless of what subreddit I visited. Anyway...

This post isn't about any abuse I've experience or witnessed in my own social life. In fact, that's a major part of the reason I decided to write this post. A trans feminist blogger I admire reblogged a conversation on Tumblr that began with one person's observation that they met more AFAB nonbinary people than AMAB nonbinary people, whereas most of the transfeminine people they knew were full-on trans women. Someone replied with a fairly long response stating, among other things, that most AFAB people who claimed a nonbinary identity were either trans men using an excuse to intrude upon women's spaces or cis women appropriating trans experiences because of their own internalized misogyny. She added that social forces (trans and nonbinary communities, the world as a whole, perhaps both) viewed transmasculine people as ""the best of both worlds"" and transfeminine people, correspondingly, as combining negative ""male"" and negative ""female"" stereotypes. She concluded that because most transmasculine people are aware of this privilege, the ""NB community is almost entirely AFAB."" Then another person—a AFAB NB person, for that matter—reblogged to add that their own people were an ""appallingly badly behaved group.""

Now, I make this post for a couple of reasons. First, I am an AFAB NB person myself (in case you couldn't tell) who has had a conflicting and complex history with their own gender presentation. Second, those experiences contrast sharply with my own. It's true that I have met more openly nonbinary AFAB people than openly nonbinary AMAB people, but I have *never* met any nonbinary person who objectified or belittled trans women, tried to exclude them, or attempted to take advantage of male privilege and trans experiences simultaneously.

Now I pose questions to the AMAB nonbinary people on this subreddit. Do you, in your social lives, experience abusive behavior from AFAB nonbinary people? Do AFAB people dominate among the nonbinary people you know? If the answer to the previous question is yes, then why do you think so? Is it possible to be nonbinary without being transmasculine if you're AFAB or transfeminine if you're AMAB? 

The remaining question, though, is how someone *knows* that someone else is not a nonbinary person but a man pretending not to be a man or a cis woman expressing internalized misogyny. What criteria would anyone have to meet in order to merit a designation as a real nonbinary person as opposed to a self-loathing cis woman? If you think you know the answer, please tell me; I'm dying to know.

Before I picked her, I made sure that she was queer and trans friendly, and from the get-go she's known that I'm nonbinary. So far, everything has been going really well, and I think therapy has been helping a lot. 

At my last appointment, though, she misgendered me for the first time since I've started seeing her. It hurt even more because we had just been talking about my growing dysphoria due to a new job, and my interest in top surgery. She apologized and moved on, like you're supposed to do, but I keep thinking about it and hurting over it. 

In my experience with other trans people I know, once I adjust and fully see them for who they are, it would feel more wrong to misgender them than not, making slip ups essentially a non issue. Wouldn't it make sense for me to expect her to be there after this long, especially since she's never known me by any other identity? I'm really considering switching therapists because of this.

My sexuality is the same. I still love my wife. Everything about her. I'm probably not going to change my outward appearance drastically. But I've always been more femme than any other guys no matter how I've tried to counter it. Beards didn't feel really right. Manly styles never felt at home. I think I'm just finally accepting who I am inside and letting me be me. \n\nShe kissed me on the head and said she loved me no matter what I identified as. That she married me for me and nothing else. So I'm glad I have such an amazingly supportive wife. I was scared to tell her but I couldn't keep it in. \n\nI told one of my best friends for years and they were more or less the same. I'm really blessed to have such an amazing support network. \n\nI just wanted to speak out and share my experience.

I was born female. And I have always been comfortable being called she/her and my name. In fact I love my name. Not gonna say it, but it is definitely a female name. 

Well anyway, I have never thought about my gender much until recently. It was my parents who made me think about it. You see, I dress sometimes more on the masculine side or androgynous (which I understand doesn't necessarily mean I'm trans/nb/etc). One day I was wearing this outfit that made me look more like a boy, and my mom questioned me and asked me if I'm transgender or trying to be like a boy. Other things have happened with my dad questioning my gender. At first I just thought ""well I'm comfortable with she/her and my name and my body, so I'm female I guess"". well then I started to think about it. In the past, people have mistaken me for a boy or said I look like a boy. And in a way, I enjoyed it. I don't know how to explain it.

Also, today my friend referred to me as ""he"" (its part of a joke we have I don't feel like explaining it) and it kinda felt normal I guess?

The one thing I was thinking about was, I don't feel dysphoric at all. I love my body the way it is. Sometimes I feel like if I was in a biologically male body, I wouldn't mind. But I always thought that if you weren't cis then you basically had to be dysphoric.

Id also like to add that I'm 14. Maybe just teenage confusion? Dunno, I don't wanna jump to conclusions yet, since I don't feel uncomfortable as me. Just wanted some thoughts I guess? Thanks!!

* Any body can be nonbinary.
* It's okay to wish that you were born into another body - even if you love the body you have.
* In an ideal world, you could assemble and reassemble your body however you wanted whenever you wanted.  But even if you could do that, you wouldn't be more awesome than you already are!
* You're allowed to do what makes you feel comfortable in your body - ""you don’t need to be miserable about something to want to change it."" -- [Changing What You Love: On Considering Hormones While You’re Non-Binary](http://www.bextalkssex.com/changing-love-considering-hormones-youre-non-binary/) 
* Other people may see a woman (at least in my case, because I'm AFAB), but that doesn't prevent you from being the most dapper of dudes.
* Every body and type of body has its own strengths and weaknesses.  You may not enjoy everything your body is and does (I certainly don't) but there are probably a whole lot of things about your body and its function that you enjoy, including things that aren't gendered at all (e.g. I can reach every spot on my back).  Try focusing on those when your body or others' perception of it gets you down.
