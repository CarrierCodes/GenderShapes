2017-03-02 20:25:31,5x5pe3,11,9,"Hi folks,

I've probably posted in this subreddit before but I can't remember. Long story short, I'm AFAB but have been questioning my feelings on gender since last year, so it's been a few months. At first I thought I was potentially a trans guy as I felt that I would identify as male but after some time that felt dishonest. I didn't have a strong sense of being male, only a desire to be one. I do still think of it every now and then.

I've tried to experiment with my gender expression, so I cut my hair, ordered a new binder and wear mostly ""masculine"" clothing. I've tried packing with a sock but also have a STP that I would like to purchase and try. Some of my friends call me my preferred name (which I really like), and when in safe spaces I tell people to use masculine or gender neutral pronouns.  To be honest I don't like  feminine ones, they do sometimes make me feel really uncomfortable and it reminds me people read me as female. Which I don't hate, I think women are great but I don't really know if I'm one?

But I also wonder my reasons behind a lot of things. Something that has happened recently is, I've been diagnosed with social anxiety, which has made me wonder if what I think is social dysphoria is actually just anxiety. 

I obviously take self identification seriously and don't want to identify as something for the wrong reasons or to get attention etc. I'd much rather not have gender related issues. 

I did read today about a concept about being cisgender by default, which made me curious. Can anyone explain this further, as maybe I'm not actually genderqueer/nonbinary but that?

2017-03-04 06:14:52,5xflm1,4,6,"(This is going to be pretty long but I will be eternally grateful to those who read it)

I'm 16, almost 17, and I've been questioning my gender on and off for about 3 years. For context, I'm AFAB. 

The first time it came up was when I was 14 and found out about androgynous fashion - I thought it was cool. I started dressing more androgynously, and started wondering if I was transgender. I thought about whether or not I wanted to be perceived as a guy, thought about transitioning (and wasn't sure whether I wanted to or not) but eventually it just left my mind. I didn't force the thoughts out or anything, I just stopped caring and was content with being seen as female again.

About a year and a half later, (and this is going to be a bit embarrassing) I was reading a yaoi fanfiction and thought, ""damn, I wish I could do that"" (in regard to penetrating someone) and then the thought crossed my mind, ""well shit, what does that mean?"" and thence started months of gender questioning and intense anxiety. 

Eventually it mostly went away again, and I was starting to feel more comfortable being seen as a woman, but then it came back again about a month ago.

Throughout this whole period, 'non-binary' has probably been what seems the most likely, but even then, I have doubts. Am I cis? Am I non-binary? Am I ftm? All these questions surround my mind and stress me out.

I'm pretty sure that I'm not FtM for a few reasons - whenever I get gendered as male in public, it makes me a bit uncomfortable. I've spoken to my doctor, my psychologist and my FtM friend about all of this, and from what I've told them, none of them feel that I am a FtM transgender person. Before all the questioning started, I was quite comfortable with my body and even wanted larger breasts. I was excited when I got to wear a proper bra for the first time because it made my chest appear larger. I would also try to achieve this through aloe vera gel massages. Additionally, I have always connected more with female characters in tv shows and video games, especially tomboyish ones (in recent years).

I'm not sure how I want to look physically and it stresses me out. I don't know what genitals I want. I want either small boobs or a flat chest (I'm not sure on this either). I'm attempting to lose weight so that I have a more androgynous figure. I'm really not sure about taking hormones because although some aspects appeal to me, like more muscle mass, I'm quite apprehensive about body and facial hair growth - I don't think it's something that I want.

A whole other can of worms is that I have had, and still have, issues with internalized misogyny. I've never had a decent female role model and all the happy/successful people around me have always been male. For reasons of jealousy, I kind of wish I had been born male - I'm aware that this might be a 'grass is greener' situation, but I feel like it would've saved me so much trouble growing up. Women have given me hell throughout my life, whether that be classmates or family. But although I get quite jealous of guys and kind of wish that I could've been born a guy, I don't think I want to be seen as one. So, a big question here is whether these feelings are caused by internalized misogyny, or gender, or both. It's also worth mentioning that sexual topics in my house were not talked about. My mum always made me feel very embarrassed of my body (unintentionally). I would go to my friends' houses where their mothers would openly talk to them about things like bras and periods and it was so foreign to me.

Another note: I am not a maternal person. I don't like kids, and the idea of becoming pregnant is repulsive to me. I feel like my first and secondary sexual characteristics are a constant reminder of my fertility, and I really don't like it.

This whole thing is incredibly stressful and I feel like I'm isolating myself because of it. I know that I'm overthinking it, but I just don't know what to do. I don't know what I want to look like. I don't know how I want to be seen.

Fortunately, I'm seeing a gender therapist for an assessment in three weeks, which I hope will be hopeful (by the way, are gender therapists typically aware of non-binary genders?).

Thanks for reading this wall of text and I would really appreciate your perspective/opinion on what you think is going on.

EDIT: Something that I thought I should mention. I actually miss dressing feminine. I used to love wearing makeup. I remember how pretty I would feel wearing dresses. I loved feeling pretty.

2017-03-05 01:09:39,5xkb9y,3,10,"Some neurodivergent ppl experience a form of gender dysphoria that only they can experience. Because of this, they may choose to identify as autgender (for autism), bordergender (for BPD), etc. These are called neurogenders.

I noticed some neurogender ppl experience internalized ableism. I never really experienced internalized ableism wrt my gender, so I'm speaking for others here, but I think I understand where they come from. They treat their gender feels like they aren't real, like their gender feels are invalid because they're caused by their neurodivergence. This is like saying sensory overload is invalid because it's caused by autism, and ignoring what's actually causing the sensory overload. They also feel like identifying as trans would be appropriation.

If you identify with a neurogender, you shouldn't dismiss your gender feels. Your identity is just as valid as an NT's. Gender is something you feel, and what you feel is perfectly valid. You're allowed to change your life based on how you feel. You're allowed to identify as trans.

Whether you identify as trans or not, if you do decide to transition, please don't feel pressured into doing things you don't want to do. But please do the things you want to do.

2017-03-08 08:33:01,5y6ttq,9,5,"I have been researching transgenderism and non-binary genders for school recently, and I noticed that the binary genders are clearly defined as male and female and the identities that correspond to these genders are respectively masculine and feminine. 
Curiously, as soon as the discussion of other genders begins, there is no longer a distinction between gender and gender identity. 

It would seem that when referring to the binary genders, gender (male/female) is equivalent to sex (male/female), and gender identity/expression (masculine/feminine) is distinctly different, relating to how people see themselves in relation to their gender/sex and how they choose to portray that idea.  

**In the case that gender is the same as gender identity then the two are distinctly different from sex. In this case though sex is male/female and gender or gender identity is masculine/feminine. 

Discussions of non-binary genders, genderfluid for example, seem to describe a gender identity. That is, one who feels more or less connected to their gender/sex (male/female) at different times. This is similar to how saying that a person is masculine is not identifying whether their gender or sex is male or female, it's simply describing some aspect of how you perceive them. I'm wondering in what way the term ""genderfluid"" and other non-binary terms are actually genders, and not merely an aspect of how one is perceived in relation to gender (i.e, gender identities).

The only way that this makes sense is if the term gender is equivalent to and synonymous with gender identity and the two are distinctly different from sex. If such is the case then I think this is a point of great confusion for many people. Saying that there are more than two genders is very difficult to understand without a clear definition of what gender is compared to biological sex and then also what gender identity is in relation to just gender.

In the case that gender is the same as gender identity and both are distinctly different from biological sex, then we must stop using the terms male and female as categories of gender, because they aren't. The word male is a noun that refers to a member of a particular species that possesses one X and one Y chromosome. This is completely unrelated to any form of identity at all. In fact the phrase ""I identify as male"" really makes no sense. What does it mean to identify with your DNA? In contrast, the phrase ""I identify as masculine"" does make sense because the word masculine is an adjective that corresponds to the typical traits of human males. By this logic, the slew of non-binary genders, are indeed forms of gender identity, distinctly different from biological sex, and the fact still stands that there are two sexes. 

**Yes, there are anomalies, where chromosomes are not exactly XY or XX, but there are also people born with no legs, yet we still claim that humans have two legs.

I 'came out' to a couple of social circles this week, who have all been supporting and understanding. This makes me happy. The details:

- I'm AFAB
- I asked to be called by my new (masculine) chosen name and he/him/his pronouns, but have also said I don't mind people using my birthname
- I've made no changes to my appearance: I still have a feminine haircut (although I've worn a cap on a couple of occasions which makes me look more masculine). I've always worn men's clothes anyway

Thing is, I keep getting insecurities about it all. That I've gone about it the wrong way.

- Have I gone too quickly, by not being out privately for months and really thinking through the concequences? (I admit it, I was too excited and only seriously thought about my gender for about a week. Once I realised ""what I am"" I got impatient. But at the same time, I've known something has been up for a long time)
- Am I going too slowly, by not cutting my hair, and allowing people to use my birthname?
- I haven't considered my family, or the man I'm having the odd date with and regularly texting. What will they think?
- Am I asking too much to ask people to call someone with a feminine haircut by a man's name?
- Am I stupid? Childish? Is this a phase? Is the happiness I get from looking like a man just excitement of looking different?

First off, I'd like to apologize because this is a throwaway account, because I do not want people who know my main account to know all this. Now that that's out of the way, time to explain who I am.

2017-03-18 03:28:04,6026xq,4,7,"Hi everyone. I decided to come here after a 'situation' occurred as I honestly didn't know where else to go. Recently, I was invited to a prom at this conservative, Catholic all-boys school. I was meant to go just to keep my friend company and to eat the free food. The day has arrived and I've honestly never been more distressed. With prom season comes the buying of suits and gowns and initially, that was fine with me. I went gown shopping tried on some gowns and only felt the normal amount of discomfort that comes when trying on clothing.

(i realize the two can be linked, but it's an important distinction for me)

i love the idea of being ambiguous. i used to work in telemarketing and on the rare occasions that somebody would refer to me as ""sir"" (i have a semi-low voice for a ladyperson) i'd be absolutely ecstatic. i want to be nothing, as weird and negative as that sounds. this is a lot harder to pull off in person though, as i have a fairly feminine face and a large chest.

i sort of want to bind, but that feels like going too far on what's basically a whim, when i know there are people who are actually Uncomfortable with the gender perceptions society has forced on them. i sort of want to use they/them pronouns, but again i don't feel it's worth troubling my friends to learn to refer to me as something else, or explaining to my family.

i also have depression, and have been casually suicidal for years (not in that i've made plans to kill myself, but often think about death and would prefer to be dead at any given time), and i'm worried my desire to be seen as neither female nor male is more about erasing myself as an entity than it is about discovering or exploring who i am. i cannot tell.

i want to clarify, i don't see other nb folks as nothing. several people very close to me are nb, including my partner, who i've recently asked to refer to me as they/them, and they're now encouraging me to tell other people. when they do remember to use they/them, it's a feeling of excitement, not necessarily rightness - i'm just really happy to not be ""she""

TL;DW She says she can't give a concrete answer to what gender is or what being female means to her because there doesn't seem to be any absolutes when you look closely.

Are these two women binary? I'm really curious to know, if you identify as non-binary, do you believe that everyone is? or is there something/a few things that you feel separate you from people who more comfortably fit into the typical gender categories? EDIT: or is it just a sense of not being close enough to male or female to comfortably assume those titles?

TL;DR It just seems like even for people who transition to the other gender (binary transgender) the idea of gender for them is still quite amorphous. These descriptions of gender sound very similar to agender/non-binary. So what's the difference?

I'm lesbian and feeling more femme, and now I just.. I don't know. I know nobody can tell me who I am except me, but I feel hurt and like I'm a fake if I am okay with being feminine and all of that.

I feel like I've lied, but inside I know the truth, but it hurts that someone would tell me that no, I'm gender non-conforming because of identifying as femme/my assigned gender at birth. It's not always like that, but I feel like that right now.

Can I, or, someone, be nonbinary, but still present themselves in a (socially acceptable/society's standard) way? I just feel horrible, I feel completely fake. My dysphoria happens sometimes, and when it did, for months I was completely against dressing feminine. I mean, I do, but I mean the stereotypes -- dresses. It literally freaked me out. Sometimes I'd picture other body parts. That never happened to me before. That specifically hasn't happened since. But at the time it was, without offending anyone, for me it was weird.

2017-03-31 08:54:55,62k3fe,5,14,"I'm AMAB, and have lived as a trans woman for like... two years, with 18 months on HRT. I've been struggling with gender identity my entire life.

I was pretty content with presenting as a woman since I came out, but recently, I've started feeling kind of... off about it. I don't really know if I pass, but everybody I've encountered has respected my gender anyways, whether I actually do or not.

I'm a lot more comfortable presenting as female than I am as male, but lately, being referred to as a woman has made me feel really off. I plan on continuing HRT and getting SRS, and my presentation is still femme enough to fit into society's standards of being a woman, but, I don't need either of those things to actually be a woman or not. Just lately, the label of being one has made me feel a little uncomfortable and strange.

I don't know if I'm really nonbinary or not... I know that there aren't any actual criteria for being any gender identity (including a lack of one), but I guess I still don't know if it's really right to call myself NB or genderqueer or anything like that. 

I haven't spent a lot of time in NB-positive spaces, and have only really gotten the perspectives of binary trans women, so I guess I'm still feeling kind of lost anyways, and scared of misinterpreting what it really means to be nonbinary in the first place. I don't want to misunderstand and then be stupid or offensive with my identity and labeling. 

I'm also scared of it just being a phase, or misinterpreting my own identity, or subconsciously conflating sex and gender and gender roles all together (I mean, I'm not *that* feminine, but still enough to still fit into traditional gender roles). I'm trying to just follow my emotions and just let things be as they are, but I guess I'm also worried about making a mistake and somehow acting like an ass to actual nonbinary people.

I don't know. I guess I'm just looking for support and clarification. I know nobody can tell me how I feel or explain my emotions to me...

Discovering the concept of non-binary identities years ago was a huge awakening for me, and I'm glad I've acknowledged my identity and my dysphoria. And identifying as non-binary has been freeing because it's allowed my to acknowledge my desire for certain aspects of transition, like top surgery, without feeling pressured to have a firm binary identity or transition ""fully.""

But I have a really hard time figuring out how and where I ""fit"" in the larger LGBTQ community, and feeling like, in general, there's no solution for my dysphoria. I like the idea of passing as male and sometimes I have strong dysphoria where I wish I had a cis male body. But ultimately, I don't feel like that dysphoria is strong or consistent enough that starting hormones and ""completely"" transitioning to male is definitely the right thing for me. Maybe it is, and I'm moving in that direction, but there are enough things that I'm not dysphoric about or that I like about my body that I just don't know if I'm ready. 

But I feel like I don't fit in anywhere. I miss feeling like a part of the lesbian/bisexual woman community sometimes, because I identified strongly with it before I realized I was non-binary, but I don't identify as female and don't feel comfortable implying that I do. I'm bisexual, but I feel like men will never find me attractive as anything but a woman, and dating men makes me feel more dysphoric because I feel like even if they're bisexual/pansexual, I won't be attractive to them in the way I want to be attractive. But I also don't feel like I fit into a lot of masculine communities, and I worry that if I do transition to a point where I pass as male, I'll feel out of place. Even among trans men, I feel out of place sometimes because I don't pass. 

If I'm honest with myself, I probably have some internalized transphobia that's making me be harder on myself about not passing. But to some degree this is also just my dysphoria being weird and vague.

Maybe I'm too focused on the idea of labels or being a member of a specific community, but that's always how I've felt. I like feeling a sense of belonging and community. I hate feeling like I don't belong anywhere, and because of that, when my dysphoria fluctuates, I'm prone to trying to convince myself that I can identify as a cis woman or a binary trans man even though I know that eventually, the pendulum will swing again.
