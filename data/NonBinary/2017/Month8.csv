2017-08-01 17:28:31,6qxsjq,3,6,"Hey folks,

I'm questioning gender stuff a bit but haven't really talked to anyone about it. I have lots of nonbinary friends and close acquaintances and am also dating someone who's nb. Also my sibling recently came out as nb.

I think the gender binary is bullshit. I'm afab and present fairly femme, though have always been more interested in a more frequent gender-netural presentation. 

I don't really experience social or body dysphoria in terms of gender. I know some people who are afab, nonbinary and present femme and sometimes gender-neutral. I think I identify with that a lot (maybe) but really don't want to be a cis person appropriating a non cis identity, especially when the label woman has never felt especially wrong (I've always felt if I was amab I would feel just as comfortable with that). I feel confident about not being trans and very much do not want to take an identity or space in a way that's harmful to trans people or nonbinary people who do experience dysphoria and less comfort moving through the world than I do or severe discomfort. I want to be clear I'm writing this because I'm just starting to question.

I've been active in LGBT communities and a vocal ""ally"" for years. I've also recently discovered I'm bi/pan, which I've questioned for awhile but was always worried about being that ""straight girl experimenting"" (which is super problematic and bi-phobic! But also is something I worried about)

ANYWAY, would love to hear how afab femme folks/amab masc folks think about think about all this both in terms of what I said, but also their own gender/experiences. If someone knows of a good thread on this, I would super love to read it.

Background info:

I was uncomfortable with female pronouns as a kid and never felt comfortable around other girls, but I wasn't ""one of the boys"" by any stretch -- mainly I was just a shy weird loner who was bullied a lot for being ""ugly"" and was never fully accepted by boys or by girls, so I attributed my pronoun issue to that. 

During puberty I felt humiliated by the changes happening to my body, but I chalked that up to having parents who instilled me with unnecessary shame about my body, sex, etc., and isn't it kind of normal to feel that way during puberty?

Around college and into my twenties I learned how to present myself in a more femme way. Makeup, hair, nail polish, clothes. A couple of times I had butch phases, but they passed.

(Through all of this, I've been queer, but closeted, and at times in severe denial. Few people in my life know that I am not straight, and at the moment I don't see that changing.)

Almost a couple of years ago I had a partial breast reduction -- partial because only one breast was made smaller, in order to correct a pretty significant asymmetry. Ever since then, I have been happier with my body and have been gradually becoming more neutral/masculine in my gender presentation. I never even realized how much the larger breast had been holding me back until it was shrunken down to size. I sometimes wish I'd just gotten full top surgery because I hate having breasts some days, even though they're small and easy to hide. 

The other night, I was looking at myself in the mirror and I thought, holy shit: could I be both a woman and a man? Neither? Something in between?

For many years I lived without thinking about my gender. I was really annoyed because I couldn't dress as a female and I envied how girls could interact among themselves. Those were the issues that pushed me to seek knowledge about myself.

3 years ago I identified as crossdresser, but didn't act on it. 1 year ago a finally realized that I wanted to change my body and identified as trans, but also as nonbinary. I didn't feel like a woman, but didn't feel like a guy neither. I felt I was something in the middle and couldn't really fit into any of the boxes. In this part I started getting annoyed when people treated me like a guy, but was embarrassed of calling myself a girl.

I don't really feel body dysphoria, but I do get a little social dysphoria sometimes. I'm afab and every so often someone will think I'm a boy, and it feels weird. Sometimes it doesn't bother me because whatever, who cares what gender random people think I am, but other times it really annoys me that people see my hair and automatically think, ""Oh short hair, must be a man!""

Sometimes it feels natural being called a girl or ma'am, but other times I cringe inside hearing gendered terms used to describe me.

 Part of that exploration process is something I've been open about with my husband... we've been together 16 years (married 10).

Today, everything fell apart. He wondered aloud, the same as I have in my head, that if nothing is changing, and i am going to be who I've always been,  why go through all this re-identification (my paraphrase)? Then he said that he's scared he won't be attracted to me anymore and that he wants his wife to be a girl and that he didn't sign up for this (his words). 

We're already going through some really tough times not related to my gender identity. And I am heart-broken and terrified and feel ashamed and guilty for putting both of us through this. I am also angry and heartbroken that I feel alone and undesirable, yet again. I read stories about people going ""back in"" because they felt pressured and/or unsupported or decided that they didn't want to sacrifice a relationship.

So, like the title says, I was on T for about 3 days shy of 3 months. I fully plan to start again in 3 months. I stopped because I'm non binary and had heard of other non binary people doing similar things in order to maintain androgyny. Specifically the creator of Neutrois Nonsense. They had experimented with going on and off for periods of 3-4 months each over some years. I talked to my Doctor at PP and she said it wouldn't be the easiest on my hormones but I could do it and be safe.  
  
I started on .25ml of 100, then moved up to .30ml after a month and a half and my last shot was .50ml. All were weekly and I never missed a dose. I've been off T for about three weeks and already things have changed.  
  
Going on T, I experienced:  
>Peen growth (I haven't measured but I'd say I'm about shy of an inch when hard?)  
  
>Facial hair. I already had a dirt stache to start with but it became coarse and I had to shave more often. I get 5 o'clock shadow now on my upper lip. I also have some coarse chin hairs. You could probably count them. Those grow back very quickly. Also I started to grow some side burns but it was very faint. And bushier eyebrows.

>Voice dropped. I can post voice recordings later but even though my family hasn't seemed to notice (they don't know I was on T), there's a big difference.  
  
>Face masculinization. I went from round baby-doll face to young man. This was the change that I loved the most. I passed about 75% of the time as a guy and the rest as a girl or ""other"".   
  
>Body hair. Legs, arms, ass, stomach, chest. It's all very subtle but my legs are very visibly more hairy including darker upper thigh hair.  
  
>Muscles! I wasn't buff but I had way more masculine arms and legs.   
  
>The rest is everything else in the book: higher sex drive, energy, hungry, sweaty, etc.  
   
  
Since then, things have changed FAST!   
No changes in hair yet, but my newfound muscles are all gone. I'm back to my feminine arms and legs. My face is a round squishy feminine face again. My dick is the same. I pass as female about 90% of the time now, albeit a hairy one, and the rest of the time, people hesitate to gender me. I can post photos if anyone wants. I've been too afraid to record my voice because that was nearly the number one reason I felt T was life or death. I absolutely hated how I used to sound and it would always give me away. Friends would even, well meaningly, ask if I experienced dysphoria because of it. Rude, I know. But without having recorded it recently, I don't know if it has raised up at all but I notice that my ""default"" tone is higher again. I can still go lower but it has to be a conscious effort.

2017-08-04 20:09:34,6rn555,13,31,"I've never wanted to make a big deal about my gender identity, and I've spent most of my life questioning it (especially before learning about nonbinary gender identities).

As of the past half year or so, I'm just now maybe 85% or so confident about the accuracy of the nonbinary / transfeminine agender labels in describing me.

And I've been sort of.. quietly and/or gradually coming out without ""coming out"" coming out, if that makes sense. I've been trickling out.

I've worn make-up on and off since I was about 14. (It's over 10 years later now.) It was initially about covering up acne, but it's also been about looking just ever so slightly more feminine.

Last year, I started wearing nail polish just as a subtle addition of femininity to my presentation. When people ask why I'm not sure what to say other than ""I like it?"" (And what I really want to do is berate them for questioning me for not aligning myself with traditional gender roles.. maybe I'll start doing that eventually who knows..)

There are a couple people in my life that I told I suffer from gender dysphoria, but without going into further detail.

A few people (close peer friends) know (that I'm nonbinary), but most only know what they see which looks like a kinda fruity mostly-straight guy.

I subtly correct friends who accidentally misgender me who know better. Like ""Who said anything about [insert gendered word/phrase here]? *sad face*"" and the like.

I do even subtler things when misgendered by someone who doesn't know (or emotionally affected by gendered language by someone who doesn't know)... 

Like.. when instructed ""guys on this side, girls on this side of the room"", starting to walk toward the girls section initially and making people giggle, and then going back to the guy's side kinda looking like ""oh, well fine, i guess so"" but it's all in such a way that people probably thought I was just joking around.

Or like.. just not responding, when the 'guys' in a room are addressed to respond or do something.

I'm near constantly pushing back against anti-male stereotypes, so I think this probably somewhat prevents people starting to think I'm MtF trans, and makes them think I identify as male and an MRA or something. MRAs think I'm feminist. Feminists think I'm MRA. I'm neither, kind of like my gender.

I've been increasingly talking about and posting links to trans/nonbinary related issues on social media (with a clearly pro stance on it).

I don't ask to go by gender neutral pronouns, but I make subtle alterations to my own language sometimes that hints at my gender identity. (E.G. Singing ""Never gonna give you up"" @ Karaoke and changing ""(you wouldn't get this from) any other guy"" to ""any of the guys"")

I recently changed my gender as displayed to my friends on my social media account to ""Non-Binary"", without announcing it or anything. Someone will only see it if they specifically browse to my ""About me"" section, but it's technically now there for all my friends to potentially see, no ambiguity (other than the sort of ambiguity that is nonbinary itself).

I mentioned offhand yesterday in a comment to a stranger on social media that I don't identify as a guy but will defend them.

I feel like the the trickling is speeding up exponentially. I'm getting more and more confident, and getting more and more fed up with the downsides of having people think I'm cisgender.

But recently I've come to realize (through being in an intimate relationship) that I don't really like how my vagina looks. Now I don't know if its just because I'm insecure about how it looks, or if I don't really liks it because its a vagina. I love my girlfriend's, but not mine.

This part may seem small but it's honestly a big reason why I've been questioning lately. In any video game I've played, or characters that I've made that are supposed to represent me, I have always chosen or created male characters. I cannot seem to make myself a female character, even when representing myself specifically (like an OC/self insert kind of character). It just doesn't seem right.

I have always had high levels of natural testosterone, which might be contributing to my dysphoric stuff. I have a strong jawline, easily put on muscle, a low voice for a girl, high sex drive, etc. I've wanted to cut my hair short for a while but I'm afraid it will look bad and/or I will wish I had my long hair back.

I've never minded being gendered as a woman, but I feel that I wouldn't mind being gendered as a guy either. Maybe. Idk, but I would want to know what it feels like.

I tried on-a-whim ""packing"" for a day to see if that felt better to me, but it didn't, so wanting a penis seems to be mainly about the sex aspect of it.

2017-08-06 18:21:46,6rzytt,4,14,"*TLDR - Would you read a blog geared toward Plus-sized, AMAB, Non-binary, Trans-feminine Style?*

Hey everyone! I (AMAB) recently came out as non-binary and even more recently have started to identify as trans-feminine. As I have begun accepting this part of my identity one of the things I did was start to shake up my wardrobe. I started shopping for women's clothes this summer and have been working to create a more feminine style for myself. When I started this journey I was looking for inspiration and discovered very quickly how little there was.

From my personal observations, it seems like most non-binary fashion and style resources out there are either by/geared toward AFAB non-binary people creating a more androgynous/masculine style, or AMAB non-binary people who are thin to average sized and often with already androgynous to feminine body types. These resources are great, but as I am definitely of the plus-sized, male-bodied variety, I became quickly frustrated because I felt like there were no resources out there for me to really draw inspiration from. With the help of some women's plus-sized style guides and some amazing friends, I was able to find styles that work for my body and make me feel great, though it took a healthy amount of trial and error.

So my question is this: would there be any interest in a blog geared toward Plus-sized, AMAB, Non-binary, Trans-feminine Style (or PANTS, as I have decided to call it)? I have considered documenting some of the outfits I have put together, talking about sizes and finding shapes and cuts that fit my body type, and my journey to realize my full self.

I have been avoiding binding not because of the heat but because of the sadness it brings. It's not increased dysphoria but grief and fear and confusion. I am non-binary. I do not have a clear cut path set for me. I have to tread a path that isn't really talked about and is thick with underbrush.

Putting on my binder reminds me how much I hate my body. How happier I would be if I could just go further with my transition. But my grief and attachment to my body makes me feel less. That I do not deserve to transition because I have formed an ok relationship with my body as it is. Looking in the mirror when I'm binding makes me feel like sobbing. I'm reminded of how happy I would be if I could face the fear.


But I AM scared. I have tried so hard to love my body. I just want to be better but I'm scared I will regret it. I am scared I'm faking it. The idea that your transition is magic is bullshit. There is a terrifying aspect to it all. To letting go of the body that you've had for your life up until now. I want to cling to my curves and softness because it's all I've known. Because I am neither here nor there and I don't know what that means for me. I am both stuck in uncertainty and certainty. This desire to chase what I know will help but not wanting to let go. The fear that not only will lovers no longer want to touch me but that I'll hate everything I'll become.


All I want is to be happy. I just want to make this body better. It'll never be perfect. But it could be better. I don't want to talk about this because I hate sharing real weakness. I have managed to get medication that makes my depression much quieter. But this feeling still hangs on my bones. I cope by forcing myself to accept my body. There's a deep hollow ache that I cradle in my rib cage.

We've been together for two years and when we first started dating L was going by their given pronoun. We have recently moved in together and we're very happy and support each other as much as possible. 

In the past year my partner has changed their pronouns and I asked L if it was okay to tell my parents which they said it was fine. So I brought it up to my parents the next time I saw and told them that L now uses they/them and my parents got very defensive and tried to argue with me about my partners decision. I dropped it when they got like that and moved on with the conversation. Since then I've brought it up multiple more times and they're still being combative. 

My mom is being better about and says she's trying and I believe her. My dad on the other hand is a Fox News conservative and I don't know how to talk to him about his beliefs and political leanings. I've tried before but he's so stuck in this mindset. 

So today my parents called on speaker phone just to see how I was doing. My partner is out of town and  were asking when they would be back but the during the entire conversation my parents never used they.

2017-08-09 20:01:27,6so37g,4,2,"Hi all, 

I thought this might be the best place to post this. I recently received a letter regarding a session at Charing Cross GIC, I'm aware that people are invited to these before their first appointment. However I have since been called in regards to a first appointment, which will be in two weeks time.

I suppose I should also give some context as to why I'm writing this post. I began my gender identity journey around September/October time last year. I essentially had been puzzling over some gender related feelings and doing my research on gender when I came to the conclusion that I was transgender (transmasculine as I'm AFAB).

Over the course of my journey, I have tried to explore my identity and expression in more depth. I was fortunate enough to have two rounds of therapy which helped me explore things more. One thing my therapist mentioned is that it sounded less that I was questioning but rather being doubtful.

This resonated with me as whenever I think of my gender, it's some form of non-binary/genderqueer/gender non-conforming identity. I identify with those labels but I feel I might be bigender (female/neutrois). I'm coming to terms with my feelings but I can't help feeling like an imposter as an AFAB femme-presenting non-binary person. 

I feel some connection to womanhood but also to gender neutrality, at times being gendered as female feels either wrong or not wholly accurate. It's hard to describe. It's also difficult because I see the stereotypes of ""SJW non-binary"" people, I am also left wing and am heavily interested in broadening the concept of gender massively. 

I never know if my anxiety comes from being nonbinary in a cisnormative society where we're told there are two genders with just many variations. 

I think any dysphoria I experience is mostly social, sometimes maybe physical. If mental dysphoria manifests as anxiety over your identity, then I'd say this is quite high.

I recently received a letter regarding a session at Charing Cross GIC, I\'m aware that people are invited to these before their first appointment. However I have since been called in regards to a first appointment, which will be in two weeks time.\n\nI suppose I should also give some context as to why I\'m writing this post. I began my gender identity journey around September/October time last year. I essentially had been puzzling over some gender related feelings and doing my research on gender when I came to the conclusion that I was transgender (transmasculine as I\'m AFAB).\n\nOver the course of my journey, I have tried to explore my identity and expression in more depth. I was fortunate enough to have two rounds of therapy which helped me explore things more. One thing my therapist mentioned is that it sounded less that I was questioning but rather being doubtful.\n\nThis resonated with me as whenever I think of my gender, it\'s some form of non-binary/genderqueer/gender non-conforming identity. I identify with those labels but I feel I might be bigender (female/neutrois). I\'m coming to terms with my feelings but I can\'t help feeling like an imposter as an AFAB femme-presenting non-binary person. \n\nI feel some connection to womanhood but also to gender neutrality, at times being gendered as female feels either wrong or not wholly accurate. It\'s hard to describe. It\'s also difficult because I see the stereotypes of ""SJW non-binary"" people, I am also left wing and am heavily interested in broadening the concept of gender massively. \n\nI never know if my anxiety comes from being nonbinary in a cisnormative society where we\'re told there are two genders with just many variations. \n\nI think any dysphoria I experience is mostly social, sometimes maybe physical. If mental dysphoria manifests as anxiety over your identity, then I\'d say this is quite high. \n\nMy main question is, will I be treated as someone who could not receive therapy at the GIC?

I can see clearly in her eyes every time that she's looking for a really warm, rewarding response from me every time she calls me by my name. She doesn't use my pronouns, I've almost given up on that.

A few of her coworkers know and made a joke about my mom changing HER name and asking me to remember it, and then I would see how hard it was for her. She came home and told me about the joke. I was offended and she said ""I thought you might react like this. It comes from a place of love."" I explained that intent does NOT mean anything, and something that comes from a well intentioned place can still be really hurtful. That seemed to get through to her a little bit, either that, or she was avoiding more conversation with me so that I wouldn't get upset.

She's generally really accepting. When I came out as queer, she was so totally fine with everything but when it comes to gender she just doesn't seem like she gets it. 

How do I make her understand that the situation she told me about isn't a joke, it's a time when I need her to defend me? How do I get her to understand that using my name is not a bonus? That it isn't a nickname? Are there any resources that I can show her that help to explain this?

2017-08-09 21:02:21,6sohu5,5,12,"Hi everyone!

I've been assigned female at birth and I've been trying to figure out who I am for awhile now. The first step was to change my name and find a gender neutral one, which my partner helped to choose. That has helped me a lot and made me feel much more comfortable with myself. 

These last few days, I've been experiencing extreme (for me) dysphoria. I basically don't feel comfortable with seeing my body (breasts and vagina) and don't feel good knowing that it's there. I also have been having trouble with woman associated nicknames such as princess. I've never experienced it before and I feel lost. I'm trying to talk about it with my partner as much as possible but I'm always afraid he'll judge me. Right now, I've asked him to use gender neutral nicknames and not refer to me as something specific but I'm afraid I might want to look more like a boy which I'm not sure how to approach yet. He has been supportive so far and says he'll always support me but I'm scared I'll go too far and want a pronoun change and he won't love me anymore. He really hasn't done anything that would make me think that way but I can't help it. 
So, he knows about all of this and is trying to avoid the nicknames and is doing everything he can to make me comfortable. 
I was just looking for advice on how to improve the situation, make the feeling disappear a little? 
Also, I wonder if I'm non binary or agender, can someone explain/define these words? Thank you for reading.

My nephew loves to dress up in dresses and he loves to wear towels on his head and pretend they're long beautiful hair. My entire family supports him however he wants to express himself. He asked me for a black/purple/red/pink wig because he's tired of using towels and it's already on it's way. 

My question; I've noticed he's been wearing his moms cardigans and his dress up capes as skirts, and pretending they are ball gowns like the characters wear on ""ever after high"" (his fav show). I found this really cute dress up skirt for kids on Amazon and want to get it for him. Do you think I should give him the skirt at his party when all the gifts are exchanged or maybe after when his classmates leave? I don't want him to get made fun of, but I don't also want him to think that expressing himself is wrong or shameful either, because it's not. I love him and my family loves him no matter what. 

I just want to protect him and his feelings. 

Any advice or suggestions would be immensely appreciated.

2017-08-23 00:01:11,6vf67w,5,6,"Hey all! 

Just recently made a Reddit account, so I'm still getting used to things. 

So several months ago while I was in a poly relationship with one of my friends who is openly MTF and already over a year into HRT (though we're not together anymore, we're still pretty close), I started really thinking more about my gender identity than I had in the past. 

That's not to say that I never thought about it prior to dating her though. I started wondering what my life would be like as a girl as early as 15 (I'm 21 and AMAB btw), even asked a few of my friends how they would see me (like would I be femme or tomboyish, I can kinda see myself as both) and even asked my parents what my name would have been if I had been AFAB. They didn't really have an answer for me though. 

I didn't really know anything about gender identity back then tho, and it's been a few years since I discovered how much I adore androgynous characters in media (especially anime because I'm a total weeb degenerate lol) and actually wanted to be one of them. But even so, I didn't even really think too deeply about that. There's definitely the feeling that I waited too long to explore all of this, and I've finally gotten to the point where I don't want to stall any longer. 

I don't know if I can say that I have dysphoria, but I do know that I'm unsatisfied with my body right now. I absolutely loathe my body hair (especially what's on my legs and in between my crotch) or how skinny my arms and torso are (which is why I started working out with a personal trainer). I don't want to get rid of my junk and I'm not sure if I want or need HRT or top surgery. But I suppose there's plenty of time to figure that out. 

After talking things through with some of my trans and NB friends, I think I'm fine with being androgyne but I want to get in touch with my feminine side more because I can't think of a single day of my life where I felt any affinity to masculinity. I feel like I could be a lot more feminine than I am now. I don't mind boys clothes but I also would love to wear cute girly stuff and pass as both male or female (because I don't necessarily see myself as either nowadays). I don't mind male pronouns but I think I'm going to try moving away from them because they/them fits me a lot more. Lastly, I'm no longer quick to correct people when they call me ma'am over the phone. 

So I guess at the end of this I have pretty much figured out that I'm non-binary, but I wanted to ask others if this sounded like being non-binary to them. 

But most importantly, what do you all think my first steps should be? I'll appreciate any responses and feedback I get from this post. Thank you.

2017-08-24 09:18:47,6vpojf,5,1,"I've been questioning my gender identity/expression/idk lately. Lots of factors are going into making me question why I am questioning it. So I am a 28 AFAB. I am okay a lot of the time with being a woman. If I were to change my pronouns at this point, I would just add on they/ them/ theirs and still use she/ her/ hers, but I realize that might be confusing for some people? I don't know what that makes me, really.

I'm just going to jump right into some things. It was discovered that I have a hormonal imbalance. I have an abnormally high testosterone count (like 113 or something) for a woman and I wasn't getting my period because of it (I don't have PCOS or any tumors, it's just abnormally high for unknown reasons - any insight as to why that could be and if that could be affecting me?). I only get my period when I'm on birth control at this point. I went back on birth control, got my period, and I was a wreck the whole month with emotions and got really bad dysphoria with my period. Like it was this foreign thing that I shouldn't be getting. I've had that a lot in the past, and I don't know if it's because I have gone really long stretches without getting it, or if it's connected to concerns about gender, or if it's because it's normal for women to hate their period. But it just didn't feel right. I was supposed to keep taking birth control, but I didn't, and didn't tell my doctor. I even asked to go on a different medication, not even voicing my concerns completely, just saying that my emotions and migraines were out of control. But now she says this other medication (metformin, which is actually a medication for diabetes, which I don't have but helps balance hormones) might give me my period, and it might help me lose weight - but now I'm thinking of asking to just go back on the birth control or do nothing because even though I need help losing weight (huge issue for me), it's not worth having my period and not having the option to skip it.

Another thing. TW: I was raped about a year ago. It really messed me up bad. I have PTSD because of it. I'm in therapy and see a psychiatrist. I was already doing that but it also caused me to be hospitalized three or four times. I've already struggled with depression, anxiety, and past abuse. Anyway, I wonder if some ""dysphoria"" I have with my breasts could actually be tied to the rape and how bruised they got, and how maybe it's just a huge trigger now. I used to be fine with that part of me. It now just makes me feel terrible when anyone is looking at my chest or sexualizing me as a woman. I never feel like a guy but I kind of want to disappear, even though at the same time I wish my boyfriend and I were having sex even though our sex life is non-existent and we're poly, and I'm scared to even try to seek out someone else.

Lately I've looked up binders and wondered how that would make me feel. I never want to be a guy. However, sometimes I really feel uncomfortable with my womanly features, or at least my chest and my long hair (I'm trying to get my hair cut really soon into some sort of side cut asymmetrical bob I think), and from what I've seen online/ on tinder, I'm really attracted to women/ people who have androgynous looking genders? I hope that doesn't sound offensive. I find myself being attracted but also wishing I looked like that and wanting to emulate it. I wonder if this is a new thing or if it's been there for a long time and I'm just now acknowledging it. I've always struggled with what to wear when I go out and some days I've dressed a certain way but some days I've dressed in a way that makes me ""comfortable"" and it leans more towards androgynous.

I have found myself lately wanting more androgynous clothing and wanting to look that way more? I've reasoned it to not wanting excess attention from guys and it being a comfort thing but I don't know if it's necessarily a negative thing in that way. I don't know if maybe it means that I just feel more comfortable being androgynous. Sometimes I still like dressing up but a lot of the time I don't. Idk.

But at the same time, I love makeup?

I think a lot of disappointment in my body is weight related. Maybe I'd be more comfortable being womanly if I wasn't overweight. But I'm not sure. Also a lot of it is related to my sexuality I feel like, and having finally come out as bisexual after hiding for so long. I feel more comfortable dressing a certain way, maybe not as feminine, because I don't have to necessarily hide who I am.

Does anyone have any insight into if any of this makes me genderqueer/ nonbinary/ genderfluid, or if there's something else going on? Does anyone have any advice for me?

2017-08-27 03:01:43,6w9yx2,18,10,"Hello. AFAB enby here. I'm still pretty new at all this, so be nice please.


I only first heard of NB people from Thomas Sander's youtube videos. His friend Joan identifies as nonbinary, and Thomas always makes sure to use their correct pronouns. It didn't click that I identified the same way until I did some pretty intense googling. If I hadn't done the research, I'd probably still be a very unhappy female.


I'm loving all the representation that the LGBTQ community is getting now, in the media, on TV and in movies, and in books, what have you. But 9 times out of 10, it's a (cis white) gay or lesbian. I can list one trans character and that's the woman from Orange is the New Black. Otherwise, every single goddamn character is either straight, or cis, or both.


On a related note, I am a strong advocate for self-discovery. It's a process, not a destination. In real life, it can take people years to understand themselves, and even if they recognize their own queerness, repression and homophobes (and transphobes, and biphobes, etc) can keep people from coming out.


This is rarely explored in the media. Gay characters are gay. They're out and proud. Or, they're gay, but they need to come out of the closet. But my point is - they know they are gay! Or bi! Or trans! Or whatever queer identity applies! They already know and have a word for themselves and everything!


I can't think of a single example (off the top of my head, feel free to illuminate me) of a queer character who *legitimately didn't know who they are* and then went through the process of self-discovery we all go through. We aren't born queer. Well, we are, but we don't shoot out of the womb wearing a rainbow flag around our necks as a cape. At some point in our lives, whether that's early or late, we figure out our identity. Or maybe we never do. And that's okay.


What's not okay is little old me sitting here thinking, I can't be bi, I've always been straight. I can be NB, I've always been cis. And yet, I went from CisHet one year to a bisexual (possibly demi-sexual) nonbinary (possibly agender) the next. I'm still in the middle of this process. And that's okay.


So, why doesn't the media acknowledge this? In my lowly opinion, it makes for a much better story than the old ""I'll have a gay panic and then suddenly be overtly gay all the time"" which is growing a bit thin. Give me a young person of color who likes to wear dresses *and* suits, and finds out they're genderqueer, but takes some time to figure out if they're trans or NB or genderfluid. Give me a 40 year old widow who never gave her sexuality a second thought until she fell for her kid's preschool teacher. Give me queer people protecting and supporting one another, and helping each other learn about themselves.


Don't give me the token gay. I don't need one minute of your gay best friend to prove you're not homophobic. I don't want to see the same cis white male have a gay panic and become that token gay best friend.


Give me people who don't know who they are, who figure out who they are in a positive way, and maybe not end up in a box. People are messy.

I suffer anxiety because I feel pressured into the binary.
One side of me says that it would be easier to live as an effeminate gay male and the other side realises that it couldn't make me happy to live as a man since I'm not a man and my brains desire feminization.

2017-08-29 06:23:53,6wpfoz,5,13,"I'm at a really rough place with my transness where I've resigned myself to never ever coming out and it really hurts but I can't imagine ever actually doing it, I'm too scared and I have absolutely no support system to fall back on.

I realized I was nonbinary four years ago and since then I've identified allll over the spectrum trying to figure out exactly where I fit and how I feel. I came out to a couple people and absolutely no one had a positive reaction, especially my mom. I still think about the hurtful messed up things she said every day and that was probably 3.5 years ago. So that pretty much kept me closeted for all of high school, I didn't get to experiment much with presentation or anything.

Then last summer I moved out of state for college and let myself come out- I got to introduce myself as my chosen name, people used they/them for me, I got to be around other trans people irl. It was a really incredible feeling. But I had a huge mental health crisis and had to drop out after one semester and move back to my tiny shitty town.

And since then I've just been mega closeted. And it really really hurts, to (on top of how fucked up the past year has been for me) have to go from feeling respected and safe for the very first time... to being 100% closeted and alone. It has really fucked me up. And I almost moved to a big city to live near my trans friend and actually try to make something happen for myself, but at the last minute I panicked and now in a few days I'm moving 1hr away to an even smaller town to live with a bunch of ""friends"" who I don't think I can ever ever ever actually come out to.

And it's really fucking with me. I try not to think about it and I try to convince myself that it's fine but I really don't think it is. All I want is to come out and present how I want to and have people call me THEY and be who I am and fall in love and have meaningful friendships and do anything but drink and shut down and repress all this shit. But I don't see how it can happen. I'm just not brave enough? I'm not strong enough? And I don't know what to do and it makes me want to kill myself.

I don't know how to talk about it and I don't have anyone to talk to about it anymore (I've spent the last 8 months pushing away anyone who actually cared about me lmfao) but I know I need to talk about it and want to talk about it. 

Today I looked at myself in the sideview mirror and something about the collared shirt/hair behind my ears/not being able to see my chest made me feel like maybe I looked like anything other than a girl, and I felt peaceful and happy with myself for the first time in so so long. I just want that feeling all the time.

tldr: super closeted, moving into an even worse even more impossible situation than I'm in right now, don't know how I can ever come out and it's making me so suicidal.

2017-08-30 07:28:35,6wxkni,2,6,"Hey guys, so I'm a little shaken and would like some advice/stories if anyone has any available.

Now obviously, I know Reddit (and the internet) is very American centric. I'll happily listen to American stories (if you have them please, feel free!) But since I'm in the UK, I'd be better hearing from UK peeps.

After another horrible bout of dysphoria (brought about by a costume company) I admitted to a friend about wanting to maybe go on hormones. Not a full transition, obviously (I'm AFAB, with no desire to be a guy), just enough that when people look at me, they don't automatically think 'GIRL!'

My friend agreed to go to the doctor with me, especially since I recently learned that apparently you have to be referred to a gender clinic if you ask. But that's as much as I know and I'm currently TERRIFIED that I'll go and be laughed out the door. Or be told I don't exist, or any of the other harmful things that people like to say about us enbies.

So please, if you've been through the gender clinic system (again, preferably UK, but I'll listen from anywhere!) And you have some insight to give me, I'd love to hear it. Even the bad stuff will calm my nerves and help me know what I'm in for, when I go.

I very recently (we are talking last week kind of recently) came to the conclusion that I'm probably not exactly cis - in the sense that I feel no particular attachment to my body or genitalia, and while I would not want to have an AMAB body, I am very meh about my AFAB one as well.

But at the same time, I also don't ... feel like I'm a woman. I experience some dissociation from my body around events like periods. I don't think cis is an accurate descriptor for me, or one that is comfortable.
