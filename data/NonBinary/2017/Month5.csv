The idea is simple: gather as much information as I possibly can on how you feel/think and create advertisement, as well as new products, that can adequately represent you.

I'm really trying to make a product that actually portrays non-binary people and helps society question the gender-binary culture, so if you could answer any of these questions you'd be helping a lot with my research! 

Anyways, here are the questions:

1. How do you feel when someone talks to you using a pronoun that doesn't represent you (""he"", ""she"", etc.)? In what way you would like to be addressed?
2. What are the biggest difficulties you face day-to-day?
3. When were your first introduced to the non-binary community? What grabbed your attention and made you research more about?
4. In your opinion, do you think the LGBT movement helps the non-binary community?
5. What is your opinion on how advertisement represents the community? Would like to see non-binary advertisement more often?
6. How do you feel when purchasing objects advertised to specific genders, such as clothes and personal hygiene products?

I'm also afraid my MIs (CPTSD and BPD) are making me think I relate to identities that I'm actually not.

I wrote a long post somewhere else but got insecure and took it down so here's kind of a brief summary... I'm afab and like (androgynous leaning) female fashion, makeup, etc. I desperately want to be considered conventionally attractive.

I also (maybe because of my lifelong abuse and trauma) never felt like I fit in with other girls or women. Sometimes I feel like cis women are living a totally different life than I am (except maybe rn I'm just being a whiny cis woman lol if so I apologize.) I've never really had a close female friend.

Oh, and I don't really feel comfortable applying the words ""woman"" or ""girl"" to myself. I hate having ""good girl"" said to me but I like ""good boy"". When I have stuffed animals I always call them by male pronouns.

But I don't really feel like a guy either. I was neglected by my father, bullied by my brother and abused by an older man. I'm afraid of men. But my closest friends in life (ie the people I've felt most comfortable around) have been androgynous or feminine leaning men.  

I used to say I wouldn't mind being reborn as a boy but now I don't really feel much of either. It would be really nice if the world suddenly became genderless and everyone were somewhere in between, because those are the people I'm most comfortable around. I wouldn't feel comfortable asking for non-gendered pronouns but I think it'd be nice if they were just implemented for everyone. 

I definitely feel like I'm in my own awkward not-real-woman corner, just a person. I definitely don't want to identify as ""both man and woman"", more like neither. Except I still like feminine (somewhat, more androgynous is better) fashion, makeup, and care a lot about becoming ""prettier"". 

What am I? If the answer is just a cis woman who needs to stfu, please let me know gently.

Suffice it to say, I'm afab, have more or less identified as a woman my whole life probably mostly because it never occurred to me I could be anything else, then in recent years felt more and more distant from my assigned gender. I've never felt like a guy, but I often don't feel like a woman, either. I think I fluctuate between female and, like, neutral.  So there's that. 

Thing is, I'm fine with she/her pronouns, I'm okay with my name (it's a gendered name for sure), and about half the time I dress pretty femme. So I've never really felt a need to ""come out"" as NB or anything. I don't have dysphoria, I don't think. At the most I feel kind of apathetic towards like my body and how people gender me.

I recently started a new job where I have to dress more professionally, and have entered a world of frustration with women's office wear being dumb but being too small to fit into men's clothes and uhg, so that's a whole thing. I normally prefer to dress pretty casual because it feels more neutral to me to just wear tees and jeans. I guess it's triggered like...an examination of my gender, along with some discomfort. I've been thinking about it all the time and reading on here and r/genderqueer and googling things. And I've been watching Kaitlyn Alexander's videos on YouTube (bless them), and can't decide if I have a giant crush on them or just want to be them. Ahaha. 

Another thing is that I've been kind of referring to myself in my head as NB/gender fluid for maybe a week or two and honestly I really like those feels. When it occurred to me that I didn't actually need to make a big outward change this revelation around (flashback to the billion other times/ways I've ""come out"" in my life), it started feeling like this kind of cool personal thing I don't have to share. Like, for the first time I'm taking control of my gender internally rather than letting people's assumptions define me. I don't do that for anything else, why should I do it for gender?

But I don't know. I've been feeling some kind of way about my gender, sometimes happy and sometimes confused and sometimes frustrated, but don't know if it...changes anything, exactly. I talk to bae about it a lot and she told me something I somehow hadn't learned in almost two years of dating, which is that she came out a few years back as just her - not a man or a woman, just her name. She's super laid back about gender and only gets bothered when people aggressively/rudely assume she's a she. And I kind of feel the same except I also have this, like, need to address it in some way. But I also don't want to make a big deal about it. Maybe it's more of an internal thing for me. But...like...gah.

I also don't want to be one of those cis people who just dislikes gender norms and conflates being a different gender with just defying expectations of their expected gender. Like, do I not want to be a woman, or am I not actually a woman? I feel more like it's the latter I'm just not sure. I don't want to take up space that isn't mine to take.

Guess I was gonna rant anyway. Oops.

TL;DR: I've been reconsidering my gender but am also sort of okay with the box I get put in, and don't know how to feel about that or what, if anything, to do.

2017-05-16 23:00:44,6bkwlj,7,11,"TL;DR: what are some key things to say when coming out as nonbinary to people of all kinds, including people who don't know about nonbinary (or maybe even binary trans people)

I really want to come out and hopefully it'll get rid of some of my fears of dressing how I want as well as the discomfort of my birth name and male pronouns but I'm not really sure how to? I have a lot of family to come out to, I was thinking of posting in our family whatsapp (which is most of the close people) but I'm not sure what to say. My mum told some of them I'm trans ages ago but my mum isn't really aware I'm nonbinary (because 1. I accepted it more so after I already came out and 2. I didn't know how to explain it). I also want to come out on Facebook and make a new profile but at the same time I don't really like Facebook. I also can't take a picture of myself that I like (although when I get my haircut it might be different)

I feel like I should message my grandparents and tell them rather than let them find out through facebook but they're not in the whatsapp chat and it feels really intimidating to message them 1 to 1.

Lastly I don't really know how to word it or how much to say. With my parents I wrote a long letter but that made sense because they're my parents but with slightly further family to random people I used to go to school with I'm not sure what kind of etiquette to go for. I feel like saying ""I'm nonbinary, they/them pronouns and my name is now Elise"" is a bit too short and less sincere but I don't think most of them want to see me spill my life story on Facebook.

I began estradiol shortly before that, and gradually increased from 1mg to my current 4mg (2mg morning and night) sublingual each day.  The goal has been to change my body to become more neutral-toward-feminine, and I've had some success with that (some breast development, erections very rare, body hair thinning and hope it thins more).  I feel good on the 4mg daily, though I'd be happier if I had more sex drive and stronger fingernails.  I've done all this through private ""civilian"" physicians.  My most recent estradiol level was 212.3 pg/ml.  I do not consider myself ""finished"" with physical transitioning, and I eventually want further bottom surgery once I lose enough weight to get it done.

The Veterans Administration has worked with my civilian doctor and provided my prescription meds.  Recently though, I moved to a new city, and the VA hospital here insists on reviewing everything with their specialists.  They now insist that I see a VA endocrinologist.  The primary care doctor there referred me ""electronically"" to one of their endocrinologists, and he returned a treatment note that was frustrating---both for misgendering and for oddball recommendations:

""Would start with baseline fasting AM total testosterone, estradiol, LH, FSH and prolactin. As patient is S/P bilateral orchiectomy, she should not require high dose oral estrogen therapy and no spironolactone. Generally, transdermal estrogen patch therapy is recommended to provide adequate circulating estrogen (30 -70 pg/ml range) while at the same time avoiding first pass hepatic
matabolism and theoretically lowering iatrogenic DVT risk. Will still require screening mammograms every 2 years (is a generally recommended frequency).""

So, clearly this endocrinologist missed the notation that I'm non-binary, NOT female, just for starters.  The fact that he wants me tested for testosterone level is bizarre, given that I'm nearly two years post-orchiectomy.  I'm all for reducing the risk of DVT, as I'm overweight, etc.  HOWEVER, dropping from 212.3 pg/ml estradiol level to a 30-70 pg/ml range sounds like a TERRIBLE idea, especially if I'm still seeking further physical transition.

Most of my body dimensions, such as waist-hip ratio, are more typically male than female. I even have my primary fat storage in my abdomen/belly. I am naturally hirsute, and have to shave daily (no testosterone). 

And I don't want to be androgynous! Sometimes I feel like I'm an MtF, and my body is just wrong. The very sight of non-passing MtFs have actually become dysphoric for me because it sets off my dysphoria over my not ""looking like a girl."" Then I go into guy mode, and my guy side is pretty happy with the base body type he has to work with. 

I'm bi-gender, with a strong female side and an only slightly weaker male side. When my two sides mix, when I'm not really in a male or female situation where one side or another comes out and totally takes over, I'm dysphoric. At home alone it's not so bad, but in public I begin to be convinced someone is going to call me out as a fraud because I'm not entirely the girl I present myself as. My physical androgyny makes matters far worse.

I tend to overcompensate toward femme to look feminine at all, and really, until recently I had no idea why I felt the way I do. Yet I also like my masculine side. I just don't really want anyone to *see* him.

I desperately wish I could be entirely girl, both in form and in mind. I want to stop being this big androgynous physical mess, and this female/male mental mess. But no amount of estrogen will ""feminize"" my face or my body, not like it works for MtFs. I'm going to try testosterone, to see if heading more to the masculine direction will take care of my dysphoria over androgyny. I'm prepared for both failure and success. 

The last two times I tried to go guy mode in dress/appearance, my boobs and lack of appendage between my legs was massively dysphoric. It was some of the highest level of dysphoria I've ever experienced, because it looked so bad. Massive fail.

2017-05-25 17:15:32,6db0zw,2,3,"Hello! I'm amab, non-binary, and 19. I'm looking for opinions and advice about how much I should tone down my presentation while taking the subway back and forth to my classes this summer. 

A little bit of background, I go to a very liberal art college where I feel pretty safe presenting however I want to. I also live in a pretty liberal area as well. I've been out and presenting as my queer self for a while, and i've been on HRT for eight months now. It's to the point now where unless I take steps to hide my breasts I look visibly trans. This works for me on a personal level, because I'm non-binary and my ideal presentation is a pretty inherently queer one. I've been able to present this way because I lived in the dorm at my school, and the dorm is right across the street from my classes, so I never felt particularly vulnerable. I dress pretty feminine or androgynous most of the time, often with makeup, skirts or cute socks and things, though mostly I just wear whatever I feel like at the time.

When I needed to go out on my own to other places on errands and such I would just dress normatively. However, this summer I'm back home and I'm taking summer classes a few times a week for about a month. I have to ride the subway for a fair ways in order to get to my school. I'm really worried about being harassed or targeted for being visibly trans on public transportation. It doesn't help that I also have pretty bad anxiety, and public transport completely terrifies me on it's own even without the added stress of being trans.

 I've gotten used to being able to express myself openly at school. While I know that's a huge privilege, I really don't want to go back to hiding my real self. I also would have to stop painting my nails for a whole month while going to classes, and having that fear interfere with my presentation in my normal personal life sucks. Toning down my presentation doesn't erase my queerness. But because I have anxiety my presentation is often the only way I can make myself visible and express myself to other people, and it's also one of the few things that gives me confidence in social situations. Plus it just hurts every time people gender me as male. Trying to ""Pass"" in public as female would be closer to my desired presentation than my assigned gender is, but I don't know if I could, and I've never really attempted it.

So what do you people think? Should I dress completely as my assigned gender on the train, or should I just present how I want anyway, or is there a viable compromise between expression and safety. It's really hard for me to decide because a combination of my anxiety, and inexperience presenting in completely public spaces prevents me from realistically assessing the situation.

tl;dr - I'm amab and present pretty feminine. I used to be close to my college classes, but now I have to take the train and I'm worried about safety with how I present.

Hey! So I'm new (I'm rarely ever on reddit) but I'm looking for some people who might be interested in submitting content for a zine I'm working on. It's called ""No Cis Allowed"" (probably) and it's gonna be made entirely by non-binary folx. 

The first issue is on sexuality, so any submissions related to that are welcome! It can be talk of your opinions or experiences, lewds or nudes, art, erotica, a comprehensive guide to eating ass....pretty much whatever -- be creative. Asexual and/or nonsexual people are totally welcome to submit too (i'm both lol). Just for this issue, please be 18+

Any profits made will be donated to Trans Lifeline and Black &amp; Pink, and anyone with content featured will get a PDF to print copies of!

You can email brucebrucebrucebruce1@gmail.com to submit! (Let me know if you'd like to be anonymous or credited) There's also a facebook group for anyone interested https://www.facebook.com/groups/155934988280282/

But many (most?) gay men have personality differences that set them apart from straight men.

So it seems to me a logical conclusion that gay men are generally a different gender than straight men. If we didn't consider them to be a different gender then it seems we're not actually taking what we know about gender seriously.
