In my initial intake appointment I was a bit uncomfortable with the provider, a nurse practitioner who happens to be a transwoman. I couldn't quite figure out why I was uncomfortable, just that I felt like I was under a microscope and it made me nervous.

My MtF husband (goes by he/him) also had the same second appointment, and while we had separate interviews last time, this time we sat in together on each other's appointments. I'm glad we did, because it made clear to *both of us* that this provider is NOT comfortable with non-binary trans presentations.

She was completely professional, but when interviewing me she was subtly aggressive and quite negative about my ""reasons"" for wanting T. She was very ""concerned"" about my conflicts and wanting to retain my feminine side (I told her of course I have conflicts, I'm non-binary.) She put me on the defensive, defending my reasons and understanding of the medical process and the permanent changes, etc, way beyond just ""informed consent"" issues. 

She was completely dismissive of my questions (which came from serious research) and when I asked about the possibility of a bit of estrogen to feed my female side she nearly freaked and never explained anything.  I asked also about vaginal atrophy, and she offered an estrogen ring. I explained that the research shows the cream is more effective, and she shrugged and said ""I wouldn't know"" in a still professional but almost snarky tone.

When she turned to my husband her entire body language and attitude changed, along the lines of, ""I'm here to take care of you and what can I do for you."" There were zero questions of why he would want HRT and didn't mention ANYTHING about informed consent issues. 

But then she dismissed questions/concerns of libido and loss of penile use, especially regarding spiro and wanting progesterone to help with function, she dismissed progesterone saying ""I don't prescribe progesterone. In my experience it causes depression."" Never mind it's a standard prescription for MtFs in the Standards of Care.

When he mentioned he wants an orchiectomy, she immediately launched into a spiel about how he didn't need one to get rid of his testes to get rid of testosterone because ""this is how HRT works"" and went into a spiel about the mechanism. I had to prod him to explain that his want for an orchi was because his testicles very existance is his primary physical dysphoria. Once she finally let him speak she changed to ""oh, I can give you a referral for that."" When I spoke up (I kept my mouth shut for most of it, my silence may have been a record for me) to say we were hoping for preservation of function, her response was ""there are other ways to have sex."" Completely dismissing our desire as a couple to continue having PIV sex. 

Which set me off and I went full snark on her and came very close to telling her off. She insisted that I would change my mind about preferring PIV sex (to me everything else is just foreplay) and that I had to learn new ways of enjoying sex. Oh, bullshit. She doesn't know me, and I'm no 20 year old kid just discovering his/her/their sexual self. I'm a 48 year old adult who has been married to my husband for 28 years. We have had long, long talks about this, both just with us and with our therapist, and came to agreements on how we would manage this.

And this ""provider"" did her best to throw out the window everything we worked together to keep our marriage intact and satisfying.

There was more, and now my husband doesn't want to be fully forthcoming with her, such as the fact that he self-medicated (DIY HRT) using birth control pills for four months (he fessed up to two weeks of it) and had NO problems with progesterone regarding depression (he felt better than ever) and now we're talking self-medication again, a bit of DIY progesterone for him, a bit of DIY estrogen for me.

2017-06-03 01:33:48,6eykxs,4,8,"Hey all,

Posted this to r/lgbt and someone there suggested I might get better responses and insight here. Feel free to let me know if there is a more appropriate space in another subreddit for this discussion. :) tl;dr at the bottom.

I've recently begun exploring my gender identity and I'm not too sure where I stand or am uber familiar with gender discourse and terminology, but here are some details about me:

* I am gay/am attracted to masculinity
* AMAB and do not feel enough discomfort with my assigned sex to the point where I'm seriously considering transitioning
* I feel neither exclusively male nor exclusively female in gender
* I don't fully subscribe to either of the traditional male or female gender roles
* I mostly dress in male clothes, have a beard, and short hair
* My natural inclination is to act in a feminine manner
* I tend to associate more/feel more comfortable socializing with those who are neither super feminine nor super masculine

I go to a dance studio and take classes that are very femme in style; e.g., femme hip hop/jazz funk, waacking, vogue, heels. Recently, I started taking a heels class where the instructor is a cisfemale and I'm feeling excluded/like the odd person out. Most of her students are also cisfemale and I am one of the few ""males"" there.

I'm not sure if she does them consciously or subconsciously, but the instructor says/does things that seem to favor cisfemales and come off as microaggressions to me. For example, in one class where I was the only one who wasn't cisfemale, she praised the ladies for doing a good job, but then said ""Oh and gentleman, too."" I'd actually feel much more comfortable and included if she had just left it at ""Great job ladies"" than her singling me out. In fact, when dance instructors separate students to perform in groups based on their gender, I often (half-jokingly) say ""I'm a lady"" because I don't quite feel like a ""man"".

She also has parts of the choreography where she has us whip our hair, but then tells the guys: ""For you men, you can do this instead."" I do have short hair, so I guess this is somewhat understandable.

I also notice that she directs her attention and individual praises toward the cisfemales. It somewhat feels like she is affirming cisfemale gender performance and doesn't quite know what to think of my femme non-cis style.

I suppose what I need help with is unpacking my reactions to her actions/words. Is this just insecurity talking? Has anyone ever felt excluded in female-centric spaces where ""female"" seems to mean female in physical sexual characteristics, gender identity, and gender presentation?

I'm also trying to fit my thoughts into a context of feminism and female empowerment. I understand that as an AMAB, I am unable to quite identify with the experiences that these women share together, but I don't think that should preclude me from feeling empowered in female-centric spaces. I fully embrace being femme and feeling sexy and powerful in a feminine manner in my dance classes, but I can't help but feel boxed out of these identities and boxed into being male in situations like those above.

Would truly appreciate any thoughts y'all have. Thanks so much.

**tl;dr I am a gay non-binary/genderqueer person who presents as mostly male on the outside but is really into feeling/being femme.

I know for sure that I am comfortable in my own body, so no dysphoria. When I picture myself in my own mind, I don't pay attention to my female bodyparts. They don't bother me, however. 

I have had moments when I was uncomfortable with being seen as a girl, and moments when I wasn't. 
When talking with people, I also imagine the way they see me. Sometimes I imagine people see me in a feminine way, but more often I don't pay attention to this or imagine they see me just as myself.
When I hang out with other girls, I don't have a problem of thinking of ourselves as being the same. However, I feel weird when men view me as different. 

I spoke a lot about how I others see me, but not about how I see me. When I think of myself, I do think of being just a person and not defined by a gender.

I don't dress up in a very feminine way (I know that how you dress up doesn't affect your gender identity) and I hate skirts as they are impractical. However, I do enjoy makeup, as it is very fun.

Sometimes when I see my back or neck in a mirror I feel weird about looking too soft (though this could also be because i am chubby and have some insecurities about it). 

I don't know if this is just me being uncomfortable with misogyny or trying to be a special snowflake, or if a nonbinary gender really fits me. Do you guys have any advice or answers? Does anybody else relate to this? Thank you so much in advance!

And when I came out to my parents--I was found out and admitted it--they both said they think I'm mentally ill. My dad has sent me article after article and raved about how transgender people who have sex changes are mentally ill and how surgery doesn't fix their problems.
But I don't want a sex change or to change my name; right now I don't want hormones. I told them that. I just want to be called by my pronouns, which my girlfriend has already started doing. The more time I spend in this closet (I started questioning after I came out at school as gay, at 17) the more it bugs me. Currently I'm putting together a coming out letter, but I'm terrified. We've all seen the terrible public reactions to those who come out or are open. We've all read the nasty comments. I'm prepared for backlash but really am afraid to face it.

2017-06-13 21:17:30,6h2y15,10,13,"I've been thinking a lot about cultural gender associations. I see transfeminine types wanting long hair and smooth skin, and transmasculine types wanting hairy bodies and beards and short hair. And maybe it's just the way I grew up, or the way I look at life, and I'm perplexed.

Maybe it's just the micro-culture I grew up in (San Francisco Bay Area), but I've never seen these as *gendered* associations.

I see hairy bodies not as a male trait, but as a hippy thing. Granola moms. Back to nature types. People I associate with either not wearing a bra or using natural organic deodorant (and never antiperspirant). And Birkenstocks. My mom is the hairiest person I know (she formed my idea of hairy as a hippy trait), except for my younger son, whom I think is part gorilla.

 When I look at pictures of hot guys in magazines, stuff like that, they're either clean shaven or, often, straight up waxed. They're never hairy. Do you see body hair on The Rock? Arnold Schwarzenegger? Any shirtless guy on a romance novel? Hairy men tend to be associated culturally with low intelligence and ""cave man"" (regressive) attitudes, or at least that's how I interpret the cultural message I see. So why is hairy a sought-out masculine trait among transmasculine folk?

Long hair is similar. I don't see long hair as a masculine or feminine trait. I see the style in which it is worn or cut as masculine or feminine. Thor (Chris Hemsworth), anyone? Maui (from Moana)? Any Viking warrior type? How about Jamie on Outlander? Where's the femininity? And again, look at romance novels. The guys' hair is often as long and flowing as the women on the cover.

Similarly, short hair. I often see it as an ""older woman's cut"" or a young woman's edgy cut if they have the bone structure to pull it off. It can be the sexiest feminine thing on the right woman. 

Moving on to skirts. Kilts. Sexiest, manliest thing on Earth. What is the difference between a kilt and a skirt? Not much, except for a bit of styling. All they did was give it a different name and suddenly no one has a problem accepting it as a masculine fashion.

2017-06-14 20:09:06,6ha346,3,6,"Hey everybody! So, I was born a guy, and I've been suffering from gender dysphoria for a while now, but I feel most comfortable identifying as a demiboy.

I came out to my best friend a while ago, and she wasn't supportive at all. I told her I have gender dysphoria. I've been stuck in this toxic relationship for a year and a half, and I am considering leaving her.

She's hurt me countless times. In the past, she has:

-lied to me multiple times, getting me in uncomfortable situations.

-blackmailed me into doing things for her that I didn't want to do. 

-cut off all communication with me after asking for a huge favor, and only talking to me when she needed another favor done.

-isolated me from all my friends so I would only have her.

-made herself look like a victim and almost having a huge dude break my neck.

-made false claims that I was stalking her, and threatened to put a restraining order on me.

-called me her puppy.

-left me stranded with no ride home.

I did everything for this girl, and when I asked for something in return, she abandoned me. But I loved her. I couldn't leave her. I'm not sure if I can even leave her now. I still love her. She's my best friend.

I've made a new friend a few weeks ago. They're genderfluid. Since I met them, only now I'm starting to realize what a horrible ""best friend"" I have. She isolated me from all my other friends over a year ago, so I had nothing to compare to. But my new friend? They're awesome. I had forgotten what it felt like having a real friend.

But, as you can imagine, the effects of the toxic relationship I'm in, combined with previous events from *before* I even met her, has left me with some very bad trust issues.

I'm hesitant to tell my new genderfluid friend about my gender dysphoria. I don't know why. Although my gender dysphoria is mostly gone, and I identify as a demiboy, there's still feminine things I want to do, such as try on girl clothes. My ""best friend"" promised we would try on girl clothes together, when she had changed her mind about my gender dysphoria and said she'd help me. Of course, this was a lie, and she only said this to shut me up. 

I realized not too long ago that I don't want to be a girl. I just didn't want to be a boy. Not completely, at least. That's why I identify as demiboy. Partially male, and partially genderless.

I want to tell my new friend that I'm a demiboy. I know they'll accept me, but I'm still scared. It sounds silly, but I'm worried that this person will just stab me in the back.

2017-06-14 21:01:55,6hafck,6,13,"I've been talking to my counselor and doctor a lot about the idea of taking testosterone, but I'm scared to actually make the jump. I'm a 25 year old AFAB person and I've dealt with gender dysphoria since I was a kid, and it has been particularly bad since I hit puberty at ten. It's so severe sometimes that I dissociate or have panic attacks. I even identified as a binary trans male on and off, mostly on, through 12 to 21, with phantom penis and everything. Working through a lot of internalized misogyny and having a few toxic relationships with dudes has landed me more in the nonbinary range. Some of that's because I experience gender pretty fluidly and most of the time I no longer identify strongly with either end of the binary, and some of it is probably because I've developed a fear of men - I'm working through that as best I can, but being seen as one is quite likely if I stay on T for the long haul. Sometimes I feel positively about it, other times negatively. I'm afraid of being seen as predatory, dirty, broken, ugly, and unlovable (which, as someone who presents as a butch lesbian currently, would be nothing new). I'm afraid of social rejection from both heternormative society and the LGBTQIA+ community. I'm afraid of facing violence for being trans, I'm afraid of losing housing and job opportunities for being trans, and I'm afraid of the cost of transition, because I'm a broke ass motherfucker and I'm pretty sure Medicaid wouldn't cover this.

I do relate a lot to womanhood at least in the sense that I was socialized into it, and it's colored pretty much all of my lived experiences so far. Sometimes I don't even mind my body as it is. I still pick apart what I don't like and wonder to what extent I'll be able to change it with exercise (although it's worth noting that no amount of restrictive eating and exercise have alleviated my dysphoria in the past), but I don't mind being read as small, soft, and feminine. I would still be seen that way on T too, I'm sure, but I'm afraid to lose that view of myself. I'm afraid of seeming predatory if I go into spaces and communities meant for women. I'm afraid I won't be able to talk about my alignment with womanhood anymore. I'm even a little afraid of no longer identifying with it. I feel like I've finally reclaimed my relationship to womanhood and femininity after having a very difficult relationship with it, so the thought of losing that makes me sad, even though rationally I know there's more than one way to practice those things. However, I also want to re-address my relationship with masculinity, because I practiced it poorly in the past and it's been dealt a lot of damage too, and I feel like T would give me a good avenue to do so.

This is all so confusing and frustrating and I find myself wishing I could just ""pick one."" I've identified as everything under the sun.. trans, butch, nonbinary, whatever. I don't really know the right words for me anymore - hell, maybe it's a little of all - I just know I have this dysphoria and fluidity, I have always struggled with them, and they're all-consuming lately. And that I'm tired. I'm tired of giving myself whiplash, constantly trying to talk myself out of it. I get so close to begging my therapist for a letter to start T, walk myself off that ledge, and then repeat on a weekly basis. It's kind of messing with my ability to function.

Sometimes I think I should stick with the cis-presenting butch thing  a while longer and just try to alter my body through working out, or that I should just try to practice radical body acceptance more. Other times I think I should just bite the bullet and try low-dose T because it seems like this obsession will never wane if I don't.

Throwaway 'cause some people I know are on reddit.


I've pretty much given up on telling my friends and teachers and everyone else I'm forced to interact with. My friends tell me that's nice, and and go back to calling me the wrong stuff, my classmates mostly tell me I don't exist and actively go against my wishes on pronouns and the like, my teachers often outright ignore me, and it's easier to check F than to get into a fight with the person behind the counter at the DMV, because, no, I didn't forget to chose, I'm just not either.



My family also isn't the safest to come out to. My father is homophobic and thinks trans people are just ""so gay they think they're women."" or bitter feminists who are too ugly to get men. My mother, while slightly more excepting in a, ""I'm happy for *those* people,"" sorta way, would probably just accuse me of wanting to be different (because there's nothing I want more than to want to tear off my face because clearly it's not mine—not me) and act as if I'm placing a huge burden on her because I want her to use the correct pronouns or not call me her fucking daughter.


I'm pretty sure my mother won't kick me out if I came out, but I can't be sure on my father, and it's a solid 4 years until I'm (hopefully) able move out for college, so if I value having shelter, I can't tell them. Due to my inability to say who I am, as far as my parents are concerned, I'm just a tomboy, and, try as I might, I can't twist it into a praise of my acting skills, that they see me as the real thing instead of a painfully bad actor stuck playing a role they got sick of years ago. The worst part is, I was raised with a more amab view on crying; that it was weak, and nothing more than a character flaw, and because I can't just stop feeling sad, I just twist it into anger. So every time they misgender me it feels like being stabbed only to feel nothing but pure rage, which really puts a strain on our relationship. The other day my mother went into a rant that revolved around the ""fact"" that I was a girl, and I don't think I've ever hated someone more than I did in that moment. (I'm still not sure if I hated her, for not letting up for what felt like an eternity, or myself, for not being able to live up to what everyone clearly thought should be a basic fact of my existence.)

Throughout my life, I've always been seen as rock-solid heterosexual male even though I'm not the least bit the macho kind of person. To quote a gay friend (who doesn't actually know about all this), I'm the kind of person who he would guess ""has a wife waiting at home"" right at first sight. Not sure why that is but the sentiment is almost universal.

However, I've always harbored a mild interest in female fashion while I myself used to dress poorly - and now only passably decent - as a guy because I just couldn't be bothered with boring male clothes. The curiosity built and built until 2014, when I stumbled upon a community of crossdressers on Facebook. Later that same year, I ended up meeting a member of the group who was a serious expert at MtF makeup jobs.

[This](https://imgur.com/quRIuu3) was the result. In the space of a minute (she wanted me to just see the final result instead of gradual change), my mind basically crashed and I went from ""ha, I'll never even look slightly feminine"" to ""now that's a version of myself that I can be proud of"".

Afterwards, she told me there was a small but visible shift in my demeanor while dressed. This sent me into a tailspin of confusion. What am I? Why do I have a female side if I still liked women and only women? Is it some kind of kink?

The only clear answer I could come up for myself at the time was for that last question. Sexual gratification wasn't even on my mind that day. It was just pure *joy*. It felt right without making my male self feel wrong.

Then I just had to let it out. I had a girlfriend and I didn't want her to misunderstand. Parents were right out since I didn't want them to deal with anything this complicated - at least not before I figured myself out. I ended up telling a female friend after much dillying and dallying.

Her first response was that I should try a different hair color next time. A wave of relief crashed into me. At the very least, I have this tiny safe space for myself.

Not long after, I ended up leaving my job for a year as a freelancer. This meant a lot of staying at home and little to no safe private time or space. The freelance year did wonders for my financial and career prospects, but my girl side was simply locked in a box, half forgotten.

A year after I first told my friend, I admitted to her that I was still feeling a kind of twinge every time I see a well-dressed woman - one part generic admiration and one part jealousy that I can't go for the same look. This was about a month before my wedding.

We talked and talked. We reached an agreement. She would help ""set me free"" for a day as a girl so I have a shot at knowing for certain what I really feel. This would be the whole shebang - full-body waxing and dresses and going outside.

That was January 9, 2017. It was the single happiest day of my life. It was actually petrifying at first - letting a friend see you as... something different for the first time, stepping outside in a dress for the first time, the works - until I went into a women's restroom and *nobody batted an eye*.

Since then, I've rented an apartment close to my house as a kind of vault for my girl stuff. That closet is filling up at a pretty good pace. My marriage is still in fine shape. I'm still attracted only to women.

The thing that concerns me the most is that he's not just spreading hate, he's also spreading misinformation about topics he knows nothing about and that he has zero experience with, but then uses his trans-status to justify his statements and act like they're true.

I'm nonbinary - specifically, agender with pretty-boy leanings.
This may get to be a long story, but I guess I have some things to get off of my chest, and I hope this is an appropriate place to do it, as I'm sure some of you have had similar experiences.  (I hope not, but it's unfortunately common.)

TL;DR: I dated a shitty chaser a few years back, they randomly reappeared recently, set me down a gripping anxiety spiral that I can't seem to fully escape.
content warning: sex, boundary issues / bad consent, chasers, slurs

Okay, so let's hop into the time machine and head back a few years to the time I met a strange human at a bar.  We're gonna call this person Socks, because their real name is equally odd (and they'd definitely find this thread, which could prove to be a shitstorm.)
Socks is an odd character.  I was at a bar doing karaoke and this person came and talked to me and my at-the-time boyfriend...at least, I think that's how it went down.  I actually don't have a very vivid memory of that night, but I do vaguely remember taking some pictures of Socks making weird faces, which still pop up on Facebook every year on that ""On This Day"" page, haha.
From that point forward, Socks and I were occasional friends.  Maybe once a year we would hang out, smoke, talk about weird shit.  Things were good that way.

But let's fast forward to 2015.  2015 was a shitty year, and I was drinking more than I should, partly because I was cheated on and broken up with on my birthday and that led me to self-medicate my depression (horribly ineffectively, I might add).  I was having one such shitty day when I made a Facebook status like,
""Hey, I wanna hang out with people but I don't want to leave my house.  Someone come over plz.""
Socks jumped on the opportunity and headed over.  We hung out, but things were different this time.  We ended up making out and things escalated from that point, and soon we were in a relationship.

Some background info on Socks: they identify as a trans woman / genderfluid.  I'm going to be using they pronouns for Socks throughout the story, although they also used she.

Maybe it's because I was high pretty much every time we hung out for the first few months, but I missed (or willingly ignored) A LOT of red flags.  Socks's chaserness was insidious.  I guess it's worth mentioning here that, at the time, I was identifying as a trans man (but getting less and less binary as time wore on).  Socks had a whole folder full of art of naked trans men saved to their phone, which they showed me.  I was more than mildly skeeved out by that - I guess it's also worth mentioning that I'm demisexual and ergo really not into porn at all.  But it gets worse.  
Whenever we were doing sexual things, they would call me names like c*ntboy, tr*nny, f*ggot...I would tell them not to, they would apologize...and do the same thing next time.  It was their attempt at ~sexily humiliating~ me, which I thought I was into, but not like that.  (I've actually realized that I'm one of the most vanilla people I know...Socks literally fetishized everything, to an absurd extent.)  Just thinking about it is making my anxiety ramp up rn.  I think that's why I need to keep writing.

In addition to using shitty slurs toward me, despite my repeated attempts to get them not to, Socks would also straight-up insult me.  Socks derogatorily called me fat all the time (I'm thick, nothing wrong with it, and if you weren't attracted to me, why are we banging anyway?) and told me that I should work out, get more muscular.  They would tell me they wished I were more manly, more aggressive.  They would try to pressure me into starting T (at this point, I had decided I didn't want to medically transition, although previously I had been considering it), telling me over and over again how hot I would be if I were manlier, etc.  If anything, all this pressure just served to further convince me that none of this was what I wanted at all.  But Socks couldn't take no for an answer, and kept trying to pressure me to be someone I wasn't.  It was creepy as shit.

Down the road, we broke it off because Socks wanted to be poly and I had explicitly stated that I am not poly, yes I've given it a shot before, no I don't ever want to try it again.  They said this was stifling them.  Fine.  Be free.  We honestly were together way longer than we should have been.  I mean, besides all the shittiness, we also had very dissimilar life goals (they wanted to have kids, I didn't, etc.) and honestly didn't get along if we weren't completely obliterated (like I said, I've drastically cut down on all substances since then.)

A few months later, I'm hanging out with my friend...let's call him Shoes.  Shoes and I go way back, and we have a lot of mutual friends, including Socks and this really cool trans woman who we're gonna call Sleeves. (I'm so creative, I know.)  
Shoes and I are talking late at night and somehow the conversation turns to Socks.  Shoes mentions that Socks has made some really creepy advances on Sleeves, i.e. telling her that she ""needs to let [Socks] try on her panties because [Socks] thinks that's hot"".  Socks also made advances on Sleeves right after we broke up, which Sleeves told me about because it made her uncomfortable.

In that moment, I realized...fuck, Socks is really predatory.  Socks is a chaser.  Socks has a fetish for trans people.  And from that point on, I wasn't sure if Socks is really trans or is just taking their fetish too far.  A harsh judgement?  For sure.  But it's possible, and there's no way to know for certain, I guess.

Anyway, let's skip to the present day.  Recently Socks texted me, after not having talked to me for months (we did still have mutual friends and had been invited to the same parties, so we would be civil for the occasion) about ""returning"" some item they had given to me during our relationship.  I told them that, no, I would be keeping it.  They then proceeded to basically accuse me of stealing.  This was all weirdly traumatic for me and caused me to have a panic attack, and I blocked them everywhere and told them to not talk to me again.  I actually wrote a call-out post for them, which, hopefully I'll never have to share that with our mutual friends, but at least I'm prepared if they want to try and start shit again.

Since then, I haven't been quite the same.  I think it was the randomness of the event, and the extremeness of the accusations, and the fact that they were reminding me of their shitty presence all at once, but I have a lot of anxiety since the text conversation.  And since I can't afford to see a therapist, I hoped writing it out would help.  So I guess that's why I'm making this post.

Has anyone experienced something similar?  Want to talk through it with me?  It would be greatly appreciated.

Someone come over plz.""\nSocks jumped on the opportunity and headed over.  We hung out, but things were different this time.  We ended up making out and things escalated from that point, and soon we were in a relationship.\n\nSome background info on Socks: they identify as a trans woman / genderfluid.  I\'m going to be using they pronouns for Socks throughout the story, although they also used she.\n\nMaybe it\'s because I was high pretty much every time we hung out for the first few months, but I missed (or willingly ignored) A LOT of red flags.  Socks\'s chaserness was insidious.  I guess it\'s worth mentioning here that, at the time, I was identifying as a trans man (but getting less and less binary as time wore on).  Socks had a whole folder full of art of naked trans men saved to their phone, which they showed me.  I was more than mildly skeeved out by that - I guess it\'s also worth mentioning that I\'m demisexual and ergo really not into porn at all.  But it gets worse.  \nWhenever we were doing sexual things, they would call me names like c*ntboy, tr*nny, f*ggot...I would tell them not to, they would apologize...and do the same thing next time.  It was their attempt at ~sexily humiliating~ me, which I thought I was into, but not like that.  (I\'ve actually realized that I\'m one of the most vanilla people I know...Socks literally fetishized everything, to an absurd extent.)  Just thinking about it is making my anxiety ramp up rn.  I think that\'s why I need to keep writing.\n\nIn addition to using shitty slurs toward me, despite my repeated attempts to get them not to, Socks would also straight-up insult me.  Socks derogatorily called me fat all the time (I\'m thick, nothing wrong with it, and if you weren\'t attracted to me, why are we banging anyway?) and told me that I should work out, get more muscular.  They would tell me they wished I were more manly, more aggressive.  They would try to pressure me into starting T (at this point, I had decided I didn\'t want to medically transition, although previously I had been considering it), telling me over and over again how hot I would be if I were manlier, etc.  If anything, all this pressure just served to further convince me that none of this was what I wanted at all.  But Socks couldn\'t take no for an answer, and kept trying to pressure me to be someone I wasn\'t.  It was creepy as shit.\n\nDown the road, we broke it off because Socks wanted to be poly and I had explicitly stated that I am not poly, yes I\'ve given it a shot before, no I don\'t ever want to try it again.  They said this was stifling them.  Fine.  Be free.  We honestly were together way longer than we should have been.  I mean, besides all the shittiness, we also had very dissimilar life goals (they wanted to have kids, I didn\'t, etc.) and honestly didn\'t get along if we weren\'t completely obliterated (like I said, I\'ve drastically cut down on all substances since then.)\n\nA few months later, I\'m hanging out with my friend...let\'s call him Shoes.  Shoes and I go way back, and we have a lot of mutual friends, including Socks and this really cool trans woman who we\'re gonna call Sleeves. (I\'m so creative, I know.)  \nShoes and I are talking late at night and somehow the conversation turns to Socks.  Shoes mentions that Socks has made some really creepy advances on Sleeves, i.e. telling her that she ""needs to let [Socks] try on her panties because [Socks] thinks that\'s hot"".  Socks also made advances on Sleeves right after we broke up, which Sleeves told me about because it made her uncomfortable.\n\nIn that moment, I realized...fuck, Socks is really predatory.  Socks is a chaser.  Socks has a fetish for trans people.  And from that point on, I wasn\'t sure if Socks is really trans or is just taking their fetish too far.  A harsh judgement?  For sure.  But it\'s possible, and there\'s no way to know for certain, I guess.\n\nAnyway, let\'s skip to the present day.  Recently Socks texted me, after not having talked to me for months (we did still have mutual friends and had been invited to the same parties, so we would be civil for the occasion) about ""returning"" some item they had given to me during our relationship.  I told them that, no, I would be keeping it.  They then proceeded to basically accuse me of stealing.  This was all weirdly traumatic for me and caused me to have a panic attack, and I blocked them everywhere and told them to not talk to me again.  I actually wrote a call-out post for them, which, hopefully I\'ll never have to share that with our mutual friends, but at least I\'m prepared if they want to try and start shit again.\n\nSince then, I haven\'t been quite the same.  I think it was the randomness of the event, and the extremeness of the accusations, and the fact that they were reminding me of their shitty presence all at once, but I have a lot of anxiety since the text conversation.  And since I can\'t afford to see a therapist, I hoped writing it out would help.  So I guess that\'s why I\'m making this post.\n\nHas anyone experienced something similar?  Want to talk through it with me?  It would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you for reading this, and I hope you have a great day.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'When a chaser from the past randomly reappears and ruins your month.', 'created': 1498182937.0}"

I was wondering how this works and figured it's best to ask those who might also be both non-binary and gay.  

I have the standard, I guess you could call it, teaching of gender and sexuality. Basically what I was taught in school: there are two genders and homosexuality is a form of sexuality and I'm trying to understand gender as we have come to understand it recently as my learning is now outdated. 

So here's my question: 

To be gay you have to have sexual feelings for the same sex as yourself so how can you be non-binary and gay. Surely, if you understand that you are gay then you have automatically declared yourself to be either male or female because you are admitting you have feelings for the same sex as yourself. 

Cheers for any replies!

Some names I've been thinking about using as a first name are Ira and Eden. As for a middle name, I'm completely stumped. I'm open to suggestions for both.

Gender-wise, I'd say I'm 85% agender, 15% a mix of female and male. I like names considered gender-neutral, even if they tend to be used one way more than the other. Names that are traditionally used for just one gender but have a more gender-neutral sound to them are also nice. (As an example, Ira and Rudy are both traditionally masculine, but they don't sound overly macho to me. I wouldn't mind names that are considered girl's names either.)
