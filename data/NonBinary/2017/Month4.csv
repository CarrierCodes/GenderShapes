Some background: I work at a small (30 people) startup based in NYC, although I generally work remotely. I've been working there for a year, over which I've been changing my outward presentation.

I was planning on coming into the office on Friday, so I asked the CEO in advance if we could schedule a short chat first thing in the morning, reassuring him that there wasn't any bad news. Once we were face-to-face I told him that my gender identity had been changing over the last several years, and that I am genderqueer and my pronouns were they/them. He said something to the effect of ""That's great, is there anything you need from me?"" I told him that all I needed was for him to use my proper pronouns and back me up if necessary.  I told him that I had prepared a short email to send out to the rest of the staff, and asked him if he wanted me to share it with him first. He told me to just go ahead and send it.

Here's the note I sent:
&gt; Hi fellow [company name]-ists,
&gt;
&gt; So I'm writing you all to let you know of a change that's been going on for me over the past year or so. I'll try to keep it short (-ish).
&gt;
&gt; I've come to find that my gender identity isn't quite what I thought it was. My gender is nonbinary and genderqueer. I'm not male or female. You may (or may not) have noticed that I've been looking a little different lately. That's what's going on.
&gt;
&gt; The only change that I'm asking from all of you is to use my new pronouns, which are [""they"" / ""them"" / ""their.""](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/singular-nonbinary-they) I appreciate your understanding with regards to this.
&gt;
&gt; So, at this point, all of you know me at least a little bit, and I hope this doesn't change anything in our working relationship. Also, I'm open to answering any clarifying questions you might have. 
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; u/jem_the_hologram

After I sent that, I got several replies from coworkers that were very short and sweet, to the effect of ""Sure, no problem.""

This is my first time sharing my experience and standpoint in online forum, so bear with me. 
I was AFAB, grew up a tomboy. I'm also a social scientist and a queer activist, and I believe that has led me to better understand my desidered gender identification, i.e.: non-binary. It actually took me a while to come to terms to the fact, that thanks but no thanks, I had no desire to turn into Mr.Right. First it was ""I'm not FTM enough, hence a coward"", now it's more ""it would have been easier if I was actually was FTM"" (without disrespect to the challenges our FTM brothers face). 
Currently I socially manage my gender identification by using both female and male pronouns, a gender neutral first name, male clothing and mannerism. My rationale is simple: if I'm striving for ambiguity, undecidability, neutrality, and I was AFAB, I need to ""counterbalance"" such assignment by ""adding"" some masculinity. I'm now looking into T therapy in order to further reach such balance as well as some specific effects that I hope would mitigate body dysphoria (i.e.: voice lowering, fat redistribution).
The practical problem I face is that I live in a EU country where transgender standards of care are quite behind, and doctors won't prescribe T to a person who does not come forward with the conventional ""wrong body"" narrative seeking a full-dose treatment with the goal of ""perfect passing"".

I've been questioning my gender for a while now. It started after my best friend came out as genderfluid, and this made me look more critically at my own gender and I've been kinda confused... 

So, I've always been masculine (I'm afab). Even since I was little I always preferred ""boy's"" clothes and interests associated with boys and masculinity. I vaguely remember thinking that I wished I was a boy back then too (although I no longer feel that way now that I know NB genders are a thing) though I think that was because I didn't like the things usually associated with girls, or act ""like a girl"". 
I had very long hair until two years ago and I always hated it so after I cut it was much happier and more confident in my appearance because I looked more like how I envisioned myself. 

During puberty I hated having boobs. I tried to ignore it but I could only do that so long. When my mum took me bra shopping for the first time I just started crying afterwards. Like, proper sobbing. These days I'm more comfortable with my chest but there are days when I wish it was flat, and I'm only comfortable with it when I'm wearing loose fitting shirts - which are the only type I ever wear now. I'm planning on getting a binder at some point.

I used to dislike having a deeper voice than other girls but I've grown to really enjoy it because I feel like it suits me more. I still find myself wishing I had a more masculine figure however. 

There's days when I identify a lot with being a woman and days when I feel weird about the term being used to refer to me. I don't feel like a man, just really masculine or somewhere in between when I'm not feeling so much like a woman on those days. I'm cool with most pronouns being used and when people mistake me for a boy I'm not *too* bothered by it, and if I confuse them about my gender then that's perfect. I really like looking androgynous most days. Sometimes not, but most days I do. Sometimes when I've had to count how many girls are, say, going to a friends house, I'd be like ""oh yeah, I'm a girl"".

I currently have very little facial hair, but I'm concerned that I might get more in the future, which I would quite dislike. Hormones might help with preventing this. However, I don't know if I'll get significantly more facial hair even without hormones, so this might not matter. My brother is about a year older than me and seems to still be getting more facial hair coming in, which suggests that I'll meet the same fate. An alternative to hormones is to use electrolysis or regular shaving combined with beard shadow concealer if necessary. This would be a hassle, though probably not as large of a hassle as hormones.


I'm currently 5' 8'', but I think I was 5' 7'' a year ago, so I may or may not be still growing. I'd really rather not get any taller. I don't know if I will, though; despite being only 5' 8'', I'm already substantially taller than everyone else in my atomic family. The change in height might have been to measurement error due to me just using a tape measurer and no mirror when I measured 5"" 7', but I doubt this.



To prevent the above two problems, I could take testosterone blockers. This would take time, cost money, and may have side-effects. Furthermore, [this](https://neutrois.me/2013/11/25/mtn-transition/) says that female hormones are required for bone health and other things. I heard someone say their doctor let them take testosterone blockers and the doctor didn't recommend taking female hormones for now, though. Taking female hormones would add further cost, inconvenience, and risk. It would also feminize the body, resulting in fat redistribution, thinner skin, and breast growth. I have a slight preference for fat distribution, probably a slight preference against breast growth, and no preference about thinner skin. Edit: Actually, I am neutral about breast growth.

It's been nearly four months since I finally figured it out at the ripe old age of 47, yet yesterday one of the things that was most obvious only just occurred to me.

For years (since at least the late 1990s) my husband (MtF, non-transitioned) has suggested I was repressed FtM and needed testosterone. I always responded immediately that I I love being a woman and would never want to give that up.

Not once did I ever respond that I didn't want to be a man. I never thought about it that way in those moments, but I often wished I could have that magic pill that could change me into a man - as long as I had the equivalent magic pill so I could be female again.

Until recently, I didn't know (understand) what non-binary was. I kinda knew what agender and androgyne were, and that's what I thought non-binary meant, just those two things. I only heard the term ""non-binary"" for the first time a couple of years ago. I knew I was neither agender or androgyne, so I immediately dismissed it as important concept for my personal use.

I told my adult children and my parents about my gender status verbally in February, and now I'm writing letters to my close family members (aunt, uncles, and a close friend). While writing it I compiled a list of many of the signs of my being transgender over the years. Seeing it in writing, all in one place, the evidence is pretty overwhelming. I feel as if I have been blind to miss it all.

All along, there was only one piece missing that kept me from understanding who and what I am. The  lack of understanding of what being non-binary is.

However, I also realize if I had figured it out as a teenager in the 1980s I would have had nowhere to go with it and would have ended up banging my head against a wall. My ignorance protected me. Non-binary was barely known or acknowledged by the psych world at that time, and treatment (even HRT) was denied to any trans person who wasn't binary AND planned to have only hetero relationships once transitioned.

My abuelita on my dad's side just called me yesterday, it had been a few years since we had last spoken. I didn't get to call her back out of panic listening to my voicemail. My relatives had explained to her that both my brother and I are trans and accepted that. However, she's old and since english isn't her first language also it would be really difficult to be seen the way that I accurately am.

My situation is much more complex than my brother. He's a little trans boy so because he's of a binary gender its a little more easier in a way to see him as such. With me I have a really mixed gender expression, i had only changed one of my pronouns to a non traditional one. I could imagine that using zhe instead of she would be really difficult, but what even frustrates me further is how to express my gender in spanish.

I wanna try and use elle, but because I don't speak spanish at all I'm at a loss to express that. I don't speak to her in spanish, but since she's better communicating that way I just know that she's going to be using ella when speaking to my other family.

I could try to gently remind her to use my chosen name and see me as her non binary grandchild than granddaughter, but pronouns all together is the worst part.

2017-04-17 17:46:07,65x3hu,3,17,"Greetings all!
Firstly I'd like to say thank you to everyone who keeps this sub running strong, even though it's such a small community it's amazing to see regular posts and positive discussion going on even in the minority of the minority, your openess and willingness to share is what's made me want to reciprocate, so keep it up everyone. Secondly, I wanted to make a post regarding my own gender and journey so far in a bid to offer a bit of personal advice to anyone in a similar situation as me. I think as we are such a unique community, it is really important we be transparent with one another as speaking from personal experience, I think we truly need as much help to dispel our own fears, misrepresentations and misinformations as possible.

So, to start at the beginning, I am transgender and am currently transitioning from what I believe to be a non-binary male form to more of a non-binary female form and what does this mean exactly? Well, the way I see it, I have never felt like a man. My sex is male, I have all the bits and anatomy of a masculine, buff cliché but I have never felt comfortable thinking of myself as, referring to myself as or even just 'being' a male.

And strangely enough, when I start to think and dare to believe myself as being more of a female, suddenly some things become a little more comfortable. Emotionally, physically, sexually, all these areas that I now see changing are somehow congruent with how I have always felt inside. But not everything it seems, is so black and white. Because even though my breasts are starting to develop, my hips are widening and my body is going through the puberty I felt I never had, there is still much of me which feels confident in my original biology. I feel natural in my unnatural, a complex combination of masculine and feminine traits portrayed imperfectly through my being.

There are days when I wake up feeling masculine and sometimes even mere moments where this aspect blends through my personality. It could be a song, a smell, a memory or a feeling which has me react in a certain way which feels more manly than anything else. It could be the people I am with, the time and place or even for no reason at all, that all of a sudden I project and experience a masculine version of myself.

Then the same goes for the feminine. A touch, a whimsy, an embrace or a taste which has me feeling so comfortable in my soft, feminine skin and I react outwardly and inwardly as any other mother, sister or daughter would.

And then I am reminded of how I am supposed to choose. One or the other, Adam or Eve. They don't make bathrooms for people like me, we don't exist except in futuristic dystopian novels about robots and bio-mechanics. So I feel confused and undone, not knowing where my man should stop and my woman should begin. For if I have to choose I must only be half of myself and doom the unselected version to be only my shadow. I cannot do this. It is not a choice, not one I am willing to make for myself. Because no matter how much 'easier' it might make my life externally, internally there is death of the being, of the self and then I would lose what it would mean to be human. So don't you dare, you beautiful person.

Don't ever feel as though you have to choose. Your life is yours, your feelings your own, we ask ourselves who we are, but very rarely do we ask ourselves who we are not. So, TLDR: here is my advice, to everyone our there non-binary, binary or questioning.

Dare to live. Be who you are and learn to reject who you are not. Nobody can tell you how you feel and it is up to you to discover where you are most yourself!

2017-04-17 18:46:00,65xhcz,2,7,"Hi there! So I apologize for this being possibly lengthy, but I'll try my best.

I've always felt like I was an ""alien,"" and it's hard to describe this feeling. I grew up as a girl and I somewhat identify as a woman, but I don't feel like I'm quite there yet?

I had a bit of a crisis last year (maybe it was gender dysphoria? I am unsure), and my boyfriend at the time who, after spending months telling me that people who ID as genderqueer and nonbinary were just doing so to be unique and special snowflakes, started referring to himself as these things (which, was incredibly ironic). I think he even told a woman that he was ""a cis nonbinary male"" or something, which seems contradictory? Anyway, I told him that I was having a bit of a crisis, and in my mind, whatever constitutes ""womanhood,"" I felt like I was on the lower end of that scale, but definitely knowing that I was *not* a man. I figured someone who is now calling himself nonbinary would surely be understanding and compassionate about what I was experiencing?

I was wrong. He laughed at me, thought I was being cute/adorable. I never brought it up again.

Side note: He ended up being exposed on Facebook for being abusive and predatory. This was actually not the first time that he had been accused of this, but this was the only time where it stuck. I think the post is still up there. Has over a thousand comments and hundreds of shares. It turned out that he, like many other men it seems, use certain labels to gain women's trust, enter their spaces and start harassing them. Among other things, he claimed that he was autistic and couldn't read ""social cues"" (though honestly when someone tells you that your persistent calling and texting is making them uncomfortable and that you should stop, that's not a cue. That's pretty blatant), ""intersexed"" (allegedly had a genetic test done and claimed he had like 10% female chromosomes), queer (despite being hetero), panromatic, etc. etc. He was extremely narcissistic.

Anyway, fast forward a few months, and I come across this guy on Facebook. We talk for a little bit and then our interactions fizzled out a bit. We start talking again and I notice his profile says that he's nonbinary. So I ask him if I can ask him a somewhat personal question. He says yes. I ask if he's an enby (I didn't know too much about it at the time, but figured that if he at least knew what that meant, then perhaps he's not bullshitting). He says ""Yessum."" So then we spend about a whole hour talking about this. The crux of my position was (and this will sound extremely silly) but I often feel like there are these ""women meetings"" that women seem to go to, maybe it's very week or every month or whenever the Moon is full or whatever. And they go to these meetings to swap tips or give lectures on how to be a woman. And either someone has deliberately given me the wrong address or I keep missing out on these meetings.

He basically feels the same way. I did mention to him that I am a bit weary of ""men"" who describe themselves as enby as a foil to being predatory or pulling the whole ""I'm not a man!"" when they are accused of sexism/misogyny. But he told me that my experiences are my experiences.

Fast forward another month and I come out to him as an enby. I think I feel somewhat more comfortable describing myself as that? He tells me he's proud of me and I can't stop smiling. it just feels super nice to be understood.

Kinda new to reddit here...

I've been on HRT for about a month now, I don't really know anyone else who identifies as non-binary and is also taking hormones.

I've always wanted to look a lot more feminine and present as androgynous. I started HRT to help with my dysphoria and hopefully look the way that I've always felt...
I'm worried about regret when it comes to my overall results with hrt... 

Just kind of curious to see if anyone else felt the same way. I feel like there's not really a whole lot of information out there...

2017-04-25 09:10:56,67ff2r,9,8,"So, I'm 30, AMAB. I've been trying to figure out my identity for as long as I can remember.

Sorry, this is gonna be disorganized and all over the place. (Also, it might get a tiny bit sexually descriptive at points, though I'll try to keep it as tame as possible.)

I can't remember exactly when my gender dysphoria started, but it definitely wasn't any later than early adolescence.. I actually have a very bad long term memory for childhood memories in general though.

But yes, I've struggled with varying levels of gender dysphoria during my life.

I grew up as the younger of two brothers in a semi-dysfunctional lower-middle-class family. Not great, not absolutely terrible, maybe average. I've always been very weird, borderline autistic-like, antisocial, etc. I wouldn't say I'm super close to either of my parents, but I probably bonded a little more with my mom than my dad. They divorced when I was 13. My brother and I continued to live with our dad.

There were times growing up where one thing would lead to another and I'd get hit by my older brother, or by my father. I was never savagely beaten to a bloody pulp or anything, but it was enough to engender a lot of rage in me, feelings of angry powerlessness.  I feel like it may have been a contributing factor to a bit of a negative outlook I developed of masculinity.

I think I sort of ended up constructing in my mind something along the lines of: Male = large = powerful = dominating = stupid = brutish, solves problems through force rather than intellect. I kinda rationally know it's a bit garbage, but.. it's kinda a feeling that formed.
In my adult years I do regularly rebel against these stereotypes wherever I find them, perhaps due to whatever small part of me that feels some connection to my biological maleness, or because I don't want these things assumed about me because of the body I have.
I don't know, it's like I rationally understand, or have been trying to convince/teach myself, that there isn't anything gross or barbaric about maleness, that I just need an attitude readjustment, but the feeling of ""yuck"" towards maleness remains.

Also, my mom was an evening alcoholic. And that may have caused me to lose some respect for femininity as well, perhaps. I probably have just a tiny bit of internalized misogyny.. I can admit.. at least under a throwaway account.. Ideas like: Woman = childlike = immature = emotional = stupid.

Note that both genders have ""stupid"" in common, in my little messed up brain. I've been a bit of a misanthrope at times in my life. I'm trying to become a more positive person though. I'm a work in progress.

Sorry I'm rambling.

So, when I was a young boy, there were a few times I sorta did ""gay stuff"" with my young male friends during sleepovers. And to this day, I consider myself ""(barely) bisexual"" and occasionally do it with men. But I am (with men) exclusively a bottom, and rarely find males visually attractive at all. To me, it really seems that my forays into homosexual behavior are a way of feeling more feminine, and that may be really all it is - that I may otherwise ""supposed to have been"" ""straight"".

None of my gay experiences were ever about me wanting to see or touch someone's penis. It has always been more like.. I want to get naked and for this other person to become aroused by me. I wanted them to fondle me. Etc. I want to feel feminine.

I'm ~95% attracted to girls, but I have difficulty with them, not in general interactions but I mean in terms of trying to pick them up sexually or romantically. I find it easy to pick up gay top men, because I feel more natural in a feminine seductive role. I feel dysphoric when I have to ""chase"" girls. It makes me feel more like a ""guy"", it makes me feel unwanted, it makes me feel like I'm some worthless vermin hunting for something beautiful. When really inside, I feel like I am a beautiful thing worth chasing myself, but as I'm in a boy's body, a boy's role is expected of me. That's kinda where the gay comes in, I can get that need satisfied in a way by being chased by gay men.

Switching gears slightly here now..  Though I considered I may be MTF trans for a time around age 14 or so, I then decided ""no, I don't want to transition, I don't want to be an imperfect girl through surgery. if i could make a wish and magically be a girl, i'd do it. but failing that I'd rather try to girlify the ""boy"" that I am as much as possible without surgeries and medications, be a ""boy"" but be girly, buck the expectations, be unique, whatever.""

My gender dysphoria would end up semi-dying down for a while while I was in a 6 year relationship with a girl who turned out to be a sociopath. We were mostly doing drugs and not having a real life during that time.

Cut to after that nightmare which I won't spend any time on here, I start going back to school and studying singing. My gender dysphoria starts coming back a bit because I want to be able to sing higher / more girly. While I'm studying singing, I meet this girl and fall madly in love with her, she doesn't like me the same way back. My gender dysphoria gets even stronger.

So, quick pause to say, up to shortly before this point, I don't think I was aware of non binary. I had been living several years of my life basically thinking ""I feel gender dysphoria, but I'm not quite a 'real' trans person, so I guess I have to just get over it by acting kinda girly where I can.""

Now I discover the gender non binary stuff. I'm a very skeptical person, so I was very suspicious of it at first. Still to some degree am, but it's growing on me. Yet there does somewhat remain this fear of, ""what if I decided to come out, identify as non binary, then 5-10 years later, some real scientific research comes out and it turns out we really ARE just snowflakes coming up with bullshit? Then I'd look like an idiot.""

But.. anyway.. yeah.. umm..

So.. I'm grossed out by body hair. I'm grossed out by bathroom humor. I have never in my life felt any desire to be larger, taller, older, etc. I (irrationally) see tallness as some sort of opposite to intelligence. I am not tall myself, but when I see a tall male, I secretly in my head sometimes think something like ""Jesus, look at that huge behemoth. If I were that tall, I'd kill myself."" I know, not healthy thoughts.

I trim my body hair down to almost nothing (easier to maintain than shaving, and I have light hair). I shave my armpits. I paint my nails. I wear colorful clothing and scarves. I wear make-up. Sometimes I skip around daintily. I like games like Mario Kart and Zelda over Grand Theft Auto or Mortal Kombat. I like Taylor Swift and Sia. I thoroughly enjoy the company of girls. Though I always kinda feel like my ability to present as feminine as I want is limited. I would wear skirts and dresses if I were female, and I lament that I can't pull them off so well as a boy, and so am generally not so daring to do so. I regularly feel limited in my clothing options for events and feel envious of the girl's and all the options they have.

As I mentioned before, my vocal range brings on dysphoria. Luckily I am not a low bass or anything, more like a high baritone or low-ish tenor. But still, it is a male voice. I associate a deep voice not with more respectability as seems to be the traditional association, but rather with stupidity, cave-man-likeness, etc. Hearing a female do that exaggeratedly low pitched impersonation of a man voice is very triggering to me. (""Is that how they see me? Some deep voiced retarded behemoth monster?"")
I want to sing the melody, not the bassline. I want my voice to sound smooth and pure and high and light, not low edgy heavy and brassy.

But.. so.. well.. I'm non binary. I've considered the terms: agender, gender-fluid, demi-boy, demi-girl, transfeminine. I don't think I'll ever be able to pick one. I think the concept of non-binary genders in western culture is still very young and primitive, and we need a better set of classifications... I feel like there are duplicates, I feel like some of the genders that have been invented are ridiculous. Genders having to do with the phases of the moon? Come on.

I feel like I am biologically male, but have a gender identity not conforming to either male nor female, although probably a tiny bit closer to female, but that many of the people talking in favor of the gender non-binary are going a little crazy with it. I feel determined to find the sane way to understand all of this. I disagree with the people who say there are only two genders, and I dislike the disrespect they give the non-binary community. But I think some of the people in the non-binary community are kinda making us an easy target with the easy-going way we've approached labeling these nonbinary genders so far.

I don't want to fight with anyone. I don't want to make anyone feel disrespected. I am indeed on your side but I have some reservations due to my skepticism is all. I am a nice person. I don't bite.

I just don't know what to make of all this. I wanna find a better way to be myself, but I'm afraid of being wrong. I want to be reasonable, and I don't want to be a ""trans-trender.""

I don't know what I am. I am relatively ok with ""he/him"" pronouns, and will also happily accept ""they/them"" although I won't ask for nor demand it. It does NOT bother me when someone calls me a ""boy"" - in fact, I almost kind of like it.. - but I HATE the word ""guy"". Same with ""dude"" and ""man"". I don't think I am a girl although I do think I should have been a girl.

I know what body parts I have, what chromosomes I have, and I know how I feel, but I don't know how to identify myself. I have told a few close friends and family members that I have gender dysphoria and have been considering the gender non-binary thing within the past year. And I live in a pretty liberal area. But, I still have reservations about coming totally ""out"".  Although there are times when I feel like if I was totally out, I wouldn't have to secretly feel hurt by certain things people say, not meaning any harm.


Ugh.. I feel bad, like I'm just rambling a huge wall of text without asking any simple primary question. I guess just.. I needed to vent, express myself and my thoughts and worries without a filter with the aid of online anonymity... and just.. if anyone has any general advice, or ideas about what terms might best fit me? Lately I'm leaning toward ""transfeminine"".  I've thought about demigirl or demiboy, but honestly, I have no idea which one I'd pick.


Sorry if this is way too long.

TL;DR version:  I am AMAB and questioning my gender identity and the entire concept of gender and non-binary genders. I have gender dysphoria about being male, and wish I had been born female, but do not wish to transition to female as things stand, and do not identify as female, and can't help but feel it's my knowledge of my own biology, at least in part, that prevents me from feeling right identifying as female. I feel more drawn to identifying as non-binary, but I feel dissatisfied with the definitions and terms and such.. And with all the confusing choices, I just really don't know how to identify.

With all the cultural changes going on in today's society, I feel a bit lost in it all.  I have a few questions that I would greatly appreciate some answers for.

* **1:  What is Gender Identity**
* **2:  What is a Gender Role**
* **3:  What is Gender Expression**

and lastly

* **4: How are these things different from one another?**

I've tried searching this up, but the general idea I'm getting from it is that Gender Identity has no weight or meaning, but that doesn't sound right considering the passion that I've seen people share for it.

2017-04-26 22:45:09,67rnot,8,10,"Hi! So I'm not sure about terminology etc so sorry if I mess up trying to explain my situation.

Basically I'm a 21 year old bi female, I guess. Buttt more and more I've found myself identifying strongly with the way males look. 
Initially I thought I just found these guys attractive, then it dawned on me that it was a bit more than that, I sort of wished I looked like them. 

The last couple of months these thoughts have become more frequent, and I think I'm more open to accepting them for what they are. I'm dating a trans girl so obviously we talk about gender a lot and I think that's allowed me to be more open to the fact I could be something other than a binary gender.

I've fantasised about having a penis, taking a more ""masculine"" role during sex and stuff as well. 

Although I say these feelings are recent, I've always identified with males, and I've always dressed in a fairly ""masculine"" way. In fact my mother often tells the story of me as a child telling her that ""when I grow up, I'm going to be a boy"". 

I certainly also identify with certain more feminine things, wearing skirts, wearing makeup, keeping my hair long etc. 

So yeah I just would like some input from people who have a better grasp on this than I do. 
It's deffo been causing me a bit of stress recently. I know no one can tell me exactly what's going on but any advice would be great.

I am 24 years old and I was assigned male at birth.
I still present as a male, I only started doing some laser hair removal sessions.
I thought I was just a gay guy till two years ago, but then I started thinking more and more to be transgender.
Now the point is what I really want to be and how I can express myself better.

The things that make think that I am no binary are:
- the fact that I don't want to have a SRS
- I hate the fact that hormones will damage my body in a long term, and I hate the fact that hormones will decrease my libido, sex drive and erections.
- I am thus comfortable with my libido and my genitals (as long as I don't need to use it in a penetrative way).
- I don't want to change the pitch of my voice (maybe I am just lazy).

By the way I'd really like to have a more feminine body and face.

I think for me being a girl would make me feel free to express who I really am, but then I wonder why I cannot express my self properly even as a boy.
Is it because of internalized homophobia?
I don't let my self being feminine, and I always try to fit in boxes.

2017-04-29 20:51:30,68bmwy,9,11,"**CW: non-detailed mention of eating disorders, sexual abuse/csa, and incest**. Also this is hella long so apologies in advance, there's a lot to get off my chest.

I have C-PTSD, depression, anxiety, disordered eating, and BPD as a result of a shit upbringing. No shocker there. I've also displayed gender nonconforming behavior my whole life starting at age two -- I speculate that my NB identity is a product of both nature and nurture. Nonetheless, I am astutely aware of how much my PTSD and BPD in particular intersect with this facet of my identity. I've experienced a loooot of sexual trauma starting in childhood continuing through my teen years and adult life from multiple abusers, and I still actively experience covert incest perpetuated by my father. I've come to realize these things over time:

I think a lot of my gender identity was formed as a defense mechanism. I probably would have been much more okay with femininity, or even with being AFAB, had I not grown up with sexual trauma, incest, and parents who berated me for not fulfilling my role as a daughter to their liking. So I rejected all things associated with femininity both as rebellion and as a means to protect myself from my father being inappropriate.. essentially, I wanted to neuter/desex myself, and I also internalized the idea that being a girl meant being a victim. I believed boys were strong; they didn't experience these things because they were the ones with power (obviously incorrect). Puberty was horrifying to me, naturally, and I IDed as transmasculine from ages 12 to 20. (That was influenced by a LOT of internalized misogyny and feeling like I had to pick one or the other.) I've experimented with performing traditional femininity, too, and liked some parts of it.. others were traumatic because of shit relationships, so I have a more positive relationship with my femme side now, but still very messy. 

And my BPD just makes it all muddier. I have incredibly low self-worth and a weak/guilty sense of identity, and I ""shapeshift"" a lot in many facets of it except those most integral to who I am. I've struggled my whole life trying to decide who or what I want to be and do. That's thankfully improving with therapy and building my independence, but I'm also very attuned to the fact that this plays a role in the maddening amount of gender fluidity I experience. I feel things intensely, sporadically, and fluidly, and my gender identity is unfortunately no exception. The eating disorders love to play into this too; not only do I get body dysphoria sometimes, but I also get body dysmorphia! It's insane trying to identify them and figure out how much of my body hate is societal conditioning and resultant dysmorphia vs. how much of it is disliking my body for being AFAB. Still haven't really managed to untangle all that. Doesn't help that I experience a lot of dissociation too, so feeling connected to my body? Yeah, that's a joke.

Sometimes it feels like I have several gender identities: One that's cis female, one that's trans male, and the androgyne in between. Most of the time I identify as nothing/in the center; other times I love my AFAB body and all that comes with it; sometimes I get enamored with the idea of how I'd look if I had a masculine presentation. The last one mostly happens when I see/look at a picture of/read and write with characters who are cute men, and I want to be like them. I want to have facial hair, a deeper voice, throw on a t-shirt without worrying about how it lays over my breasts and hips, and be perceived as masculine. This was pretty rare for a while but I've noticed that I'm feeling it more lately. When I revel in being AFAB it often coincides with enjoying traditionally feminine clothing and wanting to be seen as delicate, small, young, and desirable. I do occasionally feel genuine empowerment/strength/joy from my identity as a woman, though-- sometimes I feel guilty or ungrateful for wanting to ""abandon"" it because it feels like I'm betraying women and the hardship they face and thus my own experiences with that, which I know is a common feeling among AFAB NB folks.

When I picture myself as androgynous it can kind of fluctuate from either left or right of center, but it usually just feels.. comfortable, I guess? When I want to be cis or transmasc it happens in short and exciting bursts, but picturing myself as how I'd ideally look as an androgyne is a slightly different flavor. I'll get euphoric at the thought of going on T and all the body changes it could provide -- nervous, too, but mostly curious and happy. I'm positive that I need to at least *try* it, if I can wrangle my counselor and doctor into giving me a referral, but I'm also scared. The thought of giving up cis passing privilege is terrifying. I place too much of my self-worth into my appearance and being perceived favorably by other people, too, so self-love and acceptance are things I'll have to work hard at to achieve a healthier relationship with myself and my queerness. I've internalized so much body shame, transphobia, and binarism, though. I'm sure everyone here knows how much of a struggle that is. I am also petrified by the thought of regretting T, even though I know that a low dose for a short amount of time won't usually have too negative an effect if you decide you don't like it; I'm afraid I'd be ""damaged goods"" then more than I already am now. Part of me hopes that as I work through all of this with my counselor I will learn to just be comfortable as a cis person, honestly, because it's so much easier. And safer. And less expensive. But rationally I know those are all the wrong reasons for me to want to be a woman.

I try to remind myself that my gender identity may be partly ""symptomatic"" of my abuses and disorders, but it's still me. That doesn't take anything away from it; I'm still nonbinary and queer. I am entitled to that and I have the right to be happy in my identity and my skin. I think I know the answers, I just haven't been ready to fully accept them. Every time I make forward progress (I've come out to my immediate family, friends, and health practitioners, and I've decided to change my middle name to a masculine variant) I doubt myself even though it feels right to do. I need to follow that gut feeling and stop letting my head get in the way.

Thank you if you read all this. Mostly I just needed to say it with the chance that somebody else might be able to empathize.

The eating disorders love to play into this too; not only do I get body dysphoria sometimes, but I also get body dysmorphia! It\'s insane trying to identify them and figure out how much of my body hate is societal conditioning and resultant dysmorphia vs. how much of it is disliking my body for being AFAB. Still haven\'t really managed to untangle all that. Doesn\'t help that I experience a lot of dissociation too, so feeling connected to my body? Yeah, that\'s a joke.\n\nSometimes it feels like I have several gender identities: One that\'s cis female, one that\'s trans male, and the androgyne in between. Most of the time I identify as nothing/in the center; other times I love my AFAB body and all that comes with it; sometimes I get enamored with the idea of how I\'d look if I had a masculine presentation. The last one mostly happens when I see/look at a picture of/read and write with characters who are cute men, and I want to be like them. I want to have facial hair, a deeper voice, throw on a t-shirt without worrying about how it lays over my breasts and hips, and be perceived as masculine. This was pretty rare for a while but I\'ve noticed that I\'m feeling it more lately. When I revel in being AFAB it often coincides with enjoying traditionally feminine clothing and wanting to be seen as delicate, small, young, and desirable. I do occasionally feel genuine empowerment/strength/joy from my identity as a woman, though-- sometimes I feel guilty or ungrateful for wanting to ""abandon"" it because it feels like I\'m betraying women and the hardship they face and thus my own experiences with that, which I know is a common feeling among AFAB NB folks.\n\nWhen I picture myself as androgynous it can kind of fluctuate from either left or right of center, but it usually just feels.. comfortable, I guess? When I want to be cis or transmasc it happens in short and exciting bursts, but picturing myself as how I\'d ideally look as an androgyne is a slightly different flavor. I\'ll get euphoric at the thought of going on T and all the body changes it could provide -- nervous, too, but mostly curious and happy. I\'m positive that I need to at least *try* it, if I can wrangle my counselor and doctor into giving me a referral, but I\'m also scared. The thought of giving up cis passing privilege is terrifying. I place too much of my self-worth into my appearance and being perceived favorably by other people, too, so self-love and acceptance are things I\'ll have to work hard at to achieve a healthier relationship with myself and my queerness. I\'ve internalized so much body shame, transphobia, and binarism, though. I\'m sure everyone here knows how much of a struggle that is. I am also petrified by the thought of regretting T, even though I know that a low dose for a short amount of time won\'t usually have too negative an effect if you decide you don\'t like it; I\'m afraid I\'d be ""damaged goods"" then more than I already am now. Part of me hopes that as I work through all of this with my counselor I will learn to just be comfortable as a cis person, honestly, because it\'s so much easier. And safer. And less expensive. But rationally I know those are all the wrong reasons for me to want to be a woman.\n\nI try to remind myself that my gender identity may be partly ""symptomatic"" of my abuses and disorders, but it\'s still me. That doesn\'t take anything away from it; I\'m still nonbinary and queer. I am entitled to that and I have the right to be happy in my identity and my skin. I think I know the answers, I just haven\'t been ready to fully accept them. Every time I make forward progress (I\'ve come out to my immediate family, friends, and health practitioners, and I\'ve decided to change my middle name to a masculine variant) I doubt myself even though it feels right to do. I need to follow that gut feeling and stop letting my head get in the way.\n\nThank you if you read all this. Mostly I just needed to say it with the chance that somebody else might be able to empathize. Does anybody else struggle with how their identity as an NB person intersects with mental illness and/or trauma? I can\'t imagine I\'m totally alone in all of this.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'On being nonbinary, mentally ill, and experiencing childhood sexual abuse', 'created': 1493524290.0}"
