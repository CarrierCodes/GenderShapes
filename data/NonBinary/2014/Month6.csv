I am 24 nonbinary AFAB, and have lived ~22 years as female/woman (aka: cis gendered/sex combined)(sometimes describe myself as genderqueer). 
I need out of this cis box. I AM out. I know I ammmmm out of it, but I am without people that are also out of it. 
Be my friend?
Please note I am not only seeking people who are strictly not male or female/[hetero], just anyone who has/had/gone through a gender identity issue. 
Also, the definition of demigirl describes my gender so well (please don't hate me for it).

Edit: no longer in Troutdale! Now in Portland.
