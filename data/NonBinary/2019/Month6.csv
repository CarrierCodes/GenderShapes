&amp;#x200B;

I recently made a post about hearing my own name, and that was online being introduced to 1 new person with my name. Tonight, I was invited to go to a cafe on a college campus to see a friend of a friend do a comedy routine. I went along and expected to not really interact with people, I have pretty bad social anxiety and a hard time doing normal conversations so it was nice to think I wouldn't talk to anyone buy my friend and her boyfriend. I was wrong. It was a small establishment so though there weren't many people, it felt pretty packed. I was introduced to the person doing the comedy routine, fellow trans person which was nice to know. We went and watched in a side room and then went back to the cafe area. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is when several people began coming up to talk to my friend who invited me, people she had recently met while in hospital (including the comedian). I was sort of keeping to the side and observing rather than interacting. I was introduced but then not really talked to. But then instead of one large group it separated and I ended up talking to this one guy and girl. They would get my attention by calling me Salem and it made me stupid happy. Like hearing your name isn't something that should make you this stupidly happy. I was able to crack jokes to make them laugh and kinda make myself comfortable with them. Then we moved outside since it was hot and the whole group came together and I talked to everyone. People continually getting my attention. ""'Salem!' 'Salem you and her need to come over some time.' 'You're a true horror fan then, Salem.'"" It's like my smile couldn't compete with my heart racing.

I posted this super long post I doubt anyone will read. But I did it. And that’s a step to being honest about who I am. So yay! 

....”””””Happy Pride month everyone! I don’t normally go out of my way to post about pride. I’ve had so many people ask me why someone should have LGBT pride? When straight people don’t have pride to be straight. Why should there be gay parades and not straight parades?   

Peter Boghossian says this better than I can so I’ll quote him here, “LGBT pride does not mean being proud of having been born lesbian, gay, bisexual, or trans.

It means being proud of having survived.

LGBT pride flag
It means being proud of living in a homophobic, biphobic, transphobic society — a society that commonly treats us with contempt at best and violent hatred at worst — and still getting on with our lives. It means being proud of flourishing, in a society that commonly thinks we’re broken. It means being proud of being happy, in a society that commonly thinks we should be miserable. It means being proud of being good and compassionate, in a society that commonly thinks we’re wicked. It means being proud of fighting for our rights and the rights of others like us, in a society that commonly thinks we should lie down and let ourselves get walked on — or that thinks we should be grateful for crumbs and not ask for more. It means being proud of retaining our dignity, in a society that commonly treats us as laughing-stocks. It means being proud of loving our sexuality and our bodies, in a society that commonly thinks our sexuality and our bodies are disgusting. It means being proud of staying alive, in a society that commonly beats us down and wants us dead.
It is not easy to do any of this. Despite the many advances LGBT people have made over the decades, we still live in a society that commonly thinks we should be ashamed simply for existing. It is incredibly difficult to listen to people denigrate us, taunt us, humiliate us, bully us, shame us, from the earliest days of our childhood until the day we die — and still flourish, still be happy, still be compassionate, still fight for our rights, still retain our dignity, still love our bodies and our sexualities and our selves, still survive.

It is not easy to do any of this. It takes work.

When LGBT people talk about LGBT pride, when we attend LGBT Pride celebrations, when we say we’re proud to be gay or lesbian or bisexual or trans, this is what we’re talking about. It is a hugely important aspect of LGBT history and culture. And when people mock it and denigrate it in public, many of us take it rather personally.

I’ve struggled my whole life to be completely honest with who I am to everyone I love. In fear they wouldn’t love me in whole. That they would think a part of me was disgusting. This post is to tell anyone who takes the time to read this every part of about me, I’ve shared with you over the years was genuine. I wasn’t always proud of who I am. But as I’m growing up and being reminded everyday I am loved and accepted I am growing to have pride. If you knew me as the little girl in 90s frilly dresses, that was me! If you knew me when all I wanted to do was wear boxers, Steelers shirts, swim and watch football, also me. Through the awkward teenage years when I dated men, here’s the truth, also me! I was attracted to a couple guys. When I was a young adult and got pressured from my family to say if I was straight or gay. I said gay. Because it was the part I wanted them to accept the most. That is also me. I identify as gay, as queer, and I still find men attractive. Me in my twenties that didn’t leave the house with a low cut shirt and tons of makeup because I wanted everyone to think I was pretty. Me, when I shaved my head, bleached it blonde, tried every color I could get my hands on. Also me! It wasn’t a melt down or phase. It was me being myself without worrying what anyone would think for once. If you’ve seen the rare pictures of me questioning if people would still find me attractive if I cut all my hair off then you seen a side of me that is vulnerable. I’ve wanted to since I was a kid. Maybe someday I’ll get the guts. This year I’m taking a big step and being proud of who God has made me and is making me. I always felt God wanted to rename me. After years of questioning and not wanting to hurt anyone’s feelings I’ve embraced my name as Ace. This year I will change my gender to x on my driver license. Because it’s just another aspect of myself I need to learn to be proud of. This doesn’t mean you don’t know me if this is new information. In fact it means you now, know me more. I’m happy to share my pride with everyone now because it means I survived all the self doubt. I found out through it all my family loves me no matter who I date, what I wear, or eat (the pescatarian Year’s where hard on them lol), or what I go by. And now I’ve found a wife that makes me feel comfortable to share who I am with her and she makes me feel so loved and happy. So my goal this month is to share my pride with everyone. So they know they can be prideful of their struggles and fears too. That they too will be loved and accepted if they have the courage to be genuine.”””””

And that’s a step to being honest about who I am. So yay! \n\n....”””””Happy Pride month everyone! I don’t normally go out of my way to post about pride. I’ve had so many people ask me why someone should have LGBT pride? When straight people don’t have pride to be straight. Why should there be gay parades and not straight parades?   \n\nPeter Boghossian says this better than I can so I’ll quote him here, “LGBT pride does not mean being proud of having been born lesbian, gay, bisexual, or trans.\n\nIt means being proud of having survived.\n\nLGBT pride flag\nIt means being proud of living in a homophobic, biphobic, transphobic society — a society that commonly treats us with contempt at best and violent hatred at worst — and still getting on with our lives. It means being proud of flourishing, in a society that commonly thinks we’re broken. It means being proud of being happy, in a society that commonly thinks we should be miserable. It means being proud of being good and compassionate, in a society that commonly thinks we’re wicked. It means being proud of fighting for our rights and the rights of others like us, in a society that commonly thinks we should lie down and let ourselves get walked on — or that thinks we should be grateful for crumbs and not ask for more. It means being proud of retaining our dignity, in a society that commonly treats us as laughing-stocks. It means being proud of loving our sexuality and our bodies, in a society that commonly thinks our sexuality and our bodies are disgusting. It means being proud of staying alive, in a society that commonly beats us down and wants us dead.\nIt is not easy to do any of this. Despite the many advances LGBT people have made over the decades, we still live in a society that commonly thinks we should be ashamed simply for existing. It is incredibly difficult to listen to people denigrate us, taunt us, humiliate us, bully us, shame us, from the earliest days of our childhood until the day we die — and still flourish, still be happy, still be compassionate, still fight for our rights, still retain our dignity, still love our bodies and our sexualities and our selves, still survive.\n\nIt is not easy to do any of this. It takes work.\n\nWhen LGBT people talk about LGBT pride, when we attend LGBT Pride celebrations, when we say we’re proud to be gay or lesbian or bisexual or trans, this is what we’re talking about. It is a hugely important aspect of LGBT history and culture. And when people mock it and denigrate it in public, many of us take it rather personally. Experience has taught us that when people treat the concept of LGBT pride with hostility and contempt, they tend to treat us — our history, our culture, our struggles for equality and rights — with hostility and contempt.”\n\nI’ve struggled my whole life to be completely honest with who I am to everyone I love.

2019-06-02 15:46:10,bvyp7l,6,8,"After having sessions with my gender therapist, talking with close friends, browsing this and related subreddits, and generally mulling things over, I'm now pretty sure that I do fit somewhere under the umbrella of gender non-conformity.

But because I don't know exactly where I fit, and because there are so many different terms, I don't know how I would go about ""coming out"" if I were to do so.  And that then made me think about whether it is, in my position, even necessary to ""come out"" as any particular label.  I would much prefer to say that I'm just being me, and that I'm expressing myself in a way that makes me feel comfortable, attractive, confident, and like my true self.

Non-binary is a relatively new term, and there are still debates about what it entails, and/or if it exists, and if I tell someone that I'm non-binary, they might not understand what it means, or even after an explanation, they might still not get it, or they may see it as a fad or phase of some sort.  I don't really want to have to make these kinds of explanations all the time - I'd rather just be myself.  

With this in mind, I've decided that I want to slowly embrace a more androgynous/ambiguous appearance.  I know that having an androgynous appearance isn't necessary to be non-binary, but for my own personal aesthetic, having that kind of appearance would give me more confidence and help me be open about it.  For the record, I'm not out to family, work, or anyone except a very specific circle of friends, and it's been that way for years.  

My most recent step was getting a new haircut.  I've always had a typical short haircut (for a cisgender male, since I'm AMAB), but very recently went to see a new hair specialist who is non-binary (and uses he/him pronouns).  I told him about my situation and he gave me a haircut that makes me feel much more androgynous when looking in the mirror.  At the same time, I can also brush it in a certain way so that the haircut still looks more masculine and less androgynous, which is useful for situations like work where I don't (yet) want to be really overt about it.

As time passes, and I continue growing/styling my hair in a new way, and make some changes to my wardrobe, though, I suspect that people will have noticed that I've developed a new style.  It's hard to say whether it will lead to any questions - my thoughts are that at work at least, people tend to mind their own business, and since there are a few openly trans/non-binary people at my workplace, I'm pretty sure that a subtle change in style on my part would be any sort of an ""issue"".

My pronouns are they/them but people still use he/him at work because they simply don't know, since I haven't given any overt signals about it.  I don't want to make a big announcement about it or anything and force people to act differently around me, though if anyone does end up asking me my pronouns due to a style change, I'll likely say something like ""they/them, but here (at work), it's still fine to use he/him for me"".

In comparison, the more masculine mannerisms I have require(d) practice and near constant thought but make me feel more secure. 

For example, I have spent the past two years practicing how to walk in the _least_ swishy, most natural way possible, and the past 8 months practicing my most natural chest voice on the true but somewhat forced premise of voice acting (this was easy to justify to both myself and my mother, as I often read out my fiction stories and most of my characters are boys).

2019-06-04 04:23:40,bwkitt,3,4,"To try and make this post short, since I have a tendency to ramble:  


I'm an AFAB nonbinary person. My gender identity has fluctuated a lot over the years since coming out at around 14 (and realizing I'm trans around 13). I'm 19 now and have been on T for 3 years. I would not in any way describe myself currently as transmasculine. Y'all know how funky gender is. I put myself around bigender/genderfluid (sometimes two-spirit since I have indigenous Mexican ancestry but I'm very pale and white passing so I tend to keep that more personal).

&amp;#x200B;

I came out as a trans guy when I was about 14/15, partially because at the time my parents were not taking NB identities seriously, partially because I just hated being called she. My legal name has been changed as well as my legal sex. I started T as a trans dude and over time settled into an NB identity but still wanted to stay on T, as being gendered as a cis woman was dreadful for me, and I thought that being gendered as a cis dude wasn't perfect, but would be fine.

&amp;#x200B;

Well.. 3 years later, and I was totally wrong. The dysphoria is so different, but it's there. Oh boy it's there. It's weird too, because getting called ""she"" can still be upsetting.. and sometimes... it's not anymore. I think it's partially because my goal has always been to be androgynous and difficult to gender, so now getting she'd is almost funny to me, since most people just meet me and assume dude at this point (though this depends on what I'm wearing)...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways. I've been on T for 3 years but for a good 2 and a half of those I was awful about remembering my shot and was basically low dosing? Very consistently skipping a dose (supposed to do weekly). I was slightly bothered about how some changes were not happening much. Then I moved out, and have been consistently not missing my dose for about 3 months and... oh boy.

Mostly, it's the facial hair. Having a peach fuzz mustache and sometimes some soft neck hair that I had to shave every month at most? Awesome, actually. Now, just after 3 months.. Seriously starting to get neck hair, chin hair, lip hair.. much coarser, darker, and growing way faster? Nope. I hate it. I'm despising it. I feel ill thinking about it.

I don't regret going on T. But suddenly I'm wanting to quit cold turkey. I'm feeling paranoid about my hair thinning (I don't think it is but who knows!). I'm realizing this facial hair is PERMANENT and will probably only get thicker as time goes on. I see my face getting rough and... I guess I didn't realize beforehand that the low dosage I was accidentally giving myself was a magical sweet spot. And yeah on my occasional masc days, or days where I'd get she'd a LOT, I'd lament at how slow changes were happening.. But... I don't know. 

If this has done anything positive, it's made me feel much more valid in my nonbinary identity? Just ""she"" or ""he"" (or ""woman"" or ""man"") both make me almost equally uncomfortable these days. Different, but both bad. I just want to be me. A mix of the two is fine, ""they"" is preferred... I don't know. I thought I would be fine enough with being a dude. But it's not good either.

As per my title... AMAB enbies and transfem folks.. tips? I really love a boyish, young, androgynous look. Butchy, almost, but not in clothing style. I have no clue how to do makeup (and right now can't afford it lol) but I'm considering it. But I'm autistic and stuff like lots of foundation etc makes my skin crawl.. so.. I don't know. How expensive is laser? Should I just suck it up and shave once a week?

Has anybody else gone through anything like this? I'm not detransitioning.. I just.. T made me really happy for a long time and now suddenly it isn't anymore. I'll be seeing my doctor soon and I am planning on asking her if I can safely just move back to a shot every two weeks. Sorry for this rant. I thought for a while I had my gender perfectly figured out.. But now that I'm consistently seen as a ""man"" in day to day life, I feel myself wishing I looked more like a girl again.

In my search, I have found some semi-related post from these users (below). 

Dillarnder  
GoawayThrowaway1992

In reading, I really like how supportive and wholesome this group is! Very loving vibes on this subreddit.   


But Unfortunately, I didn't feel my question has been asked before. (that I could find)

I am cis hetero male and have always been attracted to very androgynous women. Recently I have had two NB partners and they are both super lovley, wonderful and sexy humans. Although I sometimes have trouble aligning my sexuality with their identity. I really don't want to stress anyone out on here I just want to be candid.   


I am attracted to the female body and also a female energy. When I am physically intimate with my NB partners, my body wants to engage with them because of their fem physiology and fem energy.  Their androgynous look is definitely very sexy and attractive too but I find it hard to engage with their body in any masculine or genderless way.  Naturally, I don't use gendered words in bed unless its been explicitly stated. One of my NB partners told me that they are happy with some gendered 'nicknames and descriptors'  like bitch, beautiful, hoe, bro (stuff like that). I still feel a bit odd using them because I would probably only want to use fem ones. I would rather not say much during sex to avoid leaning too much to one gender with my diction.   


I stress during sex sometimes about how much I want to engage with their feminine body and not sure how that effects them. I would eventually like to talk to them about this but also want to be careful to not contribute to any dysphoria.   


Long story short I am trying to be true to my sexuality while also respecting my partner's Identity.

I _know_ I’m not a boy
But I I’m confused to as if I’m really a girl

I became familiar with the term a year ago

Also never really minded being a boy too much in like plays and stuff, I felt mildly strange or uncomfortable but it was still fun

I had literally not once ever questioned my gender but it’s weird bc now I am and I don’t know if it’s just hallucinating things or I _think_ I’m non-binary just because

Also I’m not very familiar with gender dysphoria but I don’t think that’s my case

I ""look like a man"". What does this mean? Well, to most of us, probably not a whole lot aside from acknowledging that society views it as something. So I can argue back and forth all day long that it's impossible to look like a man because men look all sorts of different ways, but that's not going to change that what most people, the overwhelming majority of people have in mind as a man is something fairly close to what I look like. which is ironic since I was bullied my whole childhood for not being manly enough. Guess I can't win. 

I'm 6'1"", 240lbs, big arms, broad shoulders, no hips, chunky legs. Something Bigfoot adjacent. I was one of the alternative kids in high school. Emo, goth, scene, whatever. I wore makeup more then. My parents shut that down over the years. 

So here I am, not happy with being constantly misgendered but not unhappy with my body for any other reason than that it causes me to be misgendered.

Of course the onus is on people with those ideas to accept that how a person looks does not necessarily reflect their gender. But what good is this ""act of rebellion""- not femming myself up to look as androgynous as I feel- when most people don't even see it? 

Right now I'm still prioritizing my safety over my happiness because I don't see that choosing an expression that would make me happy would give me a lifestyle that makes it worth it. I feel like the things people will say to me will bring me down to feel worse than I did just flying under the radar. 

So here I am, 26 and queer but getting glares at pride cause I don't look the part after so many years of being taught to hate myself. I feel like changing myself to change other people's perception would go against my belief that I shouldn't have to look different for their perception to change. but if I don't change myself, I'll continue to be seen as a man, which also doesn't feel good.

Pre-transition I spent my life just trying to stay distracted and not kill myself (especially during my menstrual cycles). I used to self harm a lot. I used to have panic attacks when I got dressed or showered. I used to look in the mirror and just get this sinking feeling and cry. I used to hurt myself with binders that were too tight because I just wanted my chest to go away. I'd only wear baggy clothes that I could hide in and I always wore so many layers. I didn't want to leave my house a lot of the time. I didn't want to do anything but curl up in bed in a ball and try not to think about the body I was in. I felt so trapped and hopeless. I thought it would never end. 
And I used to try to be super masculine so I wouldn't get misgendered. I used to think that I was a binary trans man.

I apologize in advance for the extreme length of this post, I just want to make sure I cover everything. I'll put the questions first:

1) if your gender-questioning, gently androgynous AFAB friend eventually decided they were cis after all, would you stop feeling as connected to them, even if the only thing that changed was their pronouns? Be honest, I want to know the worst case scenario. 

2) If you've experienced something similar, how were/are you able to exist comfortably in various gendered communities? I don't think I could sustainably ""femme it up"" enough to pass for all-woman and be accepted by other women unless we go *Handmaids Tale* (god forbid) and my life depends on it.

3) if it's even an option, what is the etiquette of identifying as gender non-conforming while continuing to use birth pronouns? Firmly non-binary folks, how do you feel when other people do this? Do you make a distinction between nonbinary and nonconforming, and does it help?

4) most importantly, is it now appropriative rather than supportive for me to make aggressively pro-trans pro-enby jokes on social media? I do it a lot, but I will gladly stop if the ethics seem questionable. Ex: my friend posted a meme the other day stating that the moon was a lesbian, I added that the moon is probably a trans lesbian, since it existed as collision debris for a long time but has been out as The Moon for 4.5 billion years. They loved it, but I wonder if they'd love it less if I finally reveal I'm probably cis.

I'm 22 years old and AFAB. I usually use she/her pronouns. I have never been identified by a stranger as anything other than a woman, though I do get some double takes from time to time because of the way I dress (more on this later). I struggled to ""fit in"" with most women my whole life, and was definitely a ""tomboy"" as a kid. Lately I've had an easier time making friends with other cis women and I love my cis woman friends, but I still feel like I'm not fully part of the ""woman club"" a lot of the time. I feel horrible, vulnerable, and infantilized in almost all dresses/skirts/etc for many reasons, one being that my shoulders are naturally significantly broader than my hips and I'm slightly more muscular than average, so I feel like a rhinoceros in anything ""cute"". My ideal body is even more muscular than my current body - I would like to have arms like a somewhat fit cis man, definitely not a bodybuilder-level, but toned like a man's. I'm working on that. My sort-of-enormous ""biker calves"" are commented on by aqcuaintences pretty frequently, and they're admittedly my favorite part of me. I've got angular features that I try to emphasize as much as possible. Most, but not all of the time, I feel most like myself in very androgynous clothing. Neckties, men's shoes, blazers etc. Some days I feel very masculine, other days I feel more neutral or neutral-femme. I make friends the quickest with non binary and trans people and implicitly trust them more than anyone else. Enby folks specifically are the only people I feel I can truly relax and be myself around. I get a tangible rush of dopamine every time a friend of mine who has been living as cis comes out  as trans or enby. BUT.

They/them pronouns on their own feel alienating to me (they/them AND she/her together could totally work.) I don't have any dysphoria associated with my secondary sex characteristics. I hate bras and sometimes I like to lightly bind or conceal my (small) breasts for certain outfits, but their presence causes me no distress and sometimes I even like that they are there. I dislike being penetrated sexually, but I have no problem with my vulva and I don't wish I had something else. My voice is low for a cis woman, so I'm okay with where it is. I don't strongly identify with she/her pronouns, but they seem ever so slightly more right than the other options for now, mostly because I like the idea that the way I express my gender implies that ""she"" is an almost-meaningless term. I have a very supportive family in which almost all traditional gender roles were naturally reversed, and gender was only ever a ""big deal"" in my household because my mom is a die-hard radical feminist. Former TERF, now a vocal and vehement T\*I\*RF of her own volition.

What's causing me distress is that I know plenty of folks who present more femme/masc than I would ever be comfortable doing and strongly identify as non-binary. Other than my general lack of dysphoria, I \*should\* identify as enby, right down to my social behavior. Admittedly, I'm of the abstract opinion that the gender binary should be destroyed and EVERYONE should eventually be referred to by one gender neutral pronoun (just an opinion, I'm open to hear what more gender nonconforming folks feel about that). Until then, though, I sort of feel that I might do more to dismantle the binary by continuing to use she/her pronouns than I would if I went by they/them, although the term ""gender nonconforming"" feels exactly right for me.  I am deeply worried that my finally deciding to keep my she/her pronouns will ""other"" me from literally every available community - not part of the ""woman club"" because I present like either a man or an androgynous person and would only present more femme if I was literally being held at gunpoint, not part of the ""man club"" because I'm a she, and not part of the ""non binary club"" because I use the pronouns associated with my birth sex. I'm worried that my non binary friendships are conditional on the fact that I \*look and act\* enby and have indicated that I might be, but as soon as I decide to keep my pronouns they won't feel safe anymore and they'll shut me out.

2019-06-10 01:56:31,bys21q,12,9,"So I’ve finally realized that I don’t have to be FTM to not identify as a girl. Idk why it took me so long because I’ve always felt like I didn’t like the way my body looked; I’m curvy, even though I’m skinny, got hips and am blessed in the chest. I’ve always tried to dress up femme because I was born as a girl but only really felt good about it in the “I know other people think I look good in this outfit” kind of way. I love men’s clothes, but I don’t wear them because I know I’ll never look like a man looks in men’s clothes, and that makes me feel more dysphoric. 

Before anyone says that clothes aren’t gendered, I have to say that to me, they are. Gendering clothing helps me to wear things that make me feel more like myself, and I think that’s okay. 

I started dating a non-binary person and felt like they opened my eyes to a whole new world. Haven’t really come out to anyone, but that’s mostly just because I haven’t felt like I’ve needed to. I think most of my friends have known for a while, even if it hasn’t been put into words. 

The fact that I am very female-presenting bothers me sometimes, and I’ve considered buying a binder. I think that what bothers me the most is that usually when I try to dress more masc, the fact that I look like I’m definitely not a guy makes me feel more dysphoric than if I just dress down and try not to hide my feminine body. Sort of like the fact that I’ll never have the body I want is more obvious to me when I try.

2019-06-10 04:37:57,bytjg9,11,7,"Hi all! Buckle up.

My partner recently came out to me (F) as possibly MtF binary trans. All was good. I love helping him (he/him preferred pronouns currently) discover more about himself, and I love supporting him on this journey. 

But then he introduced me to what I now know as non binary. I always knew what it was, but this was the first time I really understood what it meant. And it all clicked for me. I never felt comfortable in my identity as a woman. But I also didn’t really feel like a man. I felt somewhere...in between? Or maybe, neither?

This would be a great end to the story. But there’s a catch - I am AFAB and I enjoy presenting female. I wear female clothes and I like presenting feminine. I wouldn’t change that. He keeps telling me that’s okay - and that gender expression and gender identity are two totally different things. He says, my expression is female but my identity is NB. 

I know if anybody else told me they were female-presenting NB I wouldn’t bat an eyelash. You do you, fuck yeah. But when it comes to me...I can’t help but really struggle with my own validity. Like, guys...I REALLY present feminine. And I know that nobody that saw me walking down the street would ever think I’m anything but cis-F. And that really, really bothers me. I considered dressing more androgynously to get the point across that I’m NB, but that made me sad and uncomfortable because I would rather PHYSICALLY present as female. It’s just not always female up in my brain. 

I hate all pronouns. I don’t like being called she/her, he/his, or even they/them. It all feels wrong. I hate all of them for me. I feel genderless up in my brain. I just want to be me.

On top of all this, I’m worried that people will look at me, lookin like a cis girl dating a trans girl, and assume that I’m saying I’m NB just because my partner is trans. I don’t want people thinking I’m just “copying” my partner. That hurts a lot to think about. 

Sorry guys. This is a lot of word salad. I just wanna know what you guys think. I still have a lot of research and self-discovery to do.

2019-06-10 13:46:27,byy1vm,7,11,"Hey all, I'm new here and recently started questioning my gender.

I'm afab, and have always thought of myself as just a butch lesbian, but recently I've been questioning if I'm actually not as cis as I thought. I get a sense of euphoria when I'm referred to as not female, and I've been really enjoying presenting super masc. I've found I get uncomfortable about my chest when I'm in public, and I just got a binder and I feel so happy when I wear it. I love how I look in male clothing, and got a haircut that I adore because I look more masc. I've gotten uncomfortable being referred to as a girl and have been intentionally lowering my voice and moving in a more 'masculine' way. I despise my hips and curves and want a sharper jawline.

That's not to say I don't like my feminine side though, I like skirts and crop tops and makeup and my lesbian identifier. I don't want facial hair and don't care about my chest when I'm alone or naked (most the time).

(TW: ED) I have a diagnosed eating disorder and body dysmorphia - so I guess what's really messing me up is am I feeling this way because of dysphoria or dysmorphia? Am I questioning being trans as a way of coping with my general hatred of my body and with the hope that there's a way for me to like myself (by transitioning)? Or am I actually trans but just confused by my mental illness? 

I guess I just want to know how you guys realised you were non binary and what your thoughts about my situation are? 

(I'm not currently in a place where I can speak to a gender therapist about this, and I feel I guess disrespectful talking with my trans friends about this cause my dumb brain thinks that if I'm 'faking it' then I'm just invalidating them by bringing it up :///)

2019-06-10 19:29:57,bz25x4,8,26,"I posted this on my Instagram but I'm just wondering if anyone here can relate.

Real talk - the past year and a half has been the hardest of my life when it comes to being queer. Confidence in who I was and that I was doing the right thing came naturally to me as a 13 year old in 2007, and I really loved being part of the gay community. When I was 18 I had no inner conflict about adding the term nonbinary - it just felt like a natural extension of who I already knew I was. I knew I was lucky to be one of the first of an era to grow up surrounded by support. This is why it floored me that I have felt so much shame and doubt when it became necessary to actually DO something about the dysphoria I was feeling. 

Being nonbinary right now is not easy and I have felt guilt over every possible thing. Asking people to use they/them pronouns when I know it's difficult. The idea that my weirdness makes things harder for binary trans people. Worrying I was making myself less attractive and therefore less valuable as a partner.  Feeling broken/defective/different.  People fighting over my right to stay part of the lesbian community. Feeling guilty for wanting the things I did and wondering if I was somehow faking it. Feeling like I shouldn't be making a big deal out of things, that gender wasn't important enough for all this. These hurtful ideas come from both inside and outside the LGBT community, and it adds up. And all of this has come with a lot of doubt that I'm doing the right thing. 

It is hard to feel proud when you're the butt of so many jokes. It's hard to exist with an identity that is difficult to explain. It's also hard to be proud when you aren't sure who you are or where you fit. And when your identity doesn't fit easily into the world. Everything has been a lot harder emotionally than I expected, and then I felt ashamed about that because being confident in being queer was important to me. 

Right now I am slowly building up confidence in who I am and what feels comfortable for me now. I have come along way and I have a long way to go still.

Maybe some of u will like this one and want to use it, or find similar analogies from this one

Here goes:

U walk into a buffet with cakes. The moment u walk through the door, someone hands u a piece of apple cake and says ""this is ur cake"". Now, if u love apple cake (aka. ur cis) this is fine. U keep on with ur apple cake and have a great time

But say u hate apple cake. It's the worst. Why did they hand u the apple cake? U didn't ask for this! What are u gonna do about it, just walk around with a cake u can't enjoy? This is dysphoria, u are trans. U have something, but u don't want it

On the other hand, what if ur just ok with the apple cake? It's not ur favorite, but if offered u would probably eat some of it. U walk around nibbling on the apple cake every now and then, but then u spot it...! A nice looking chocolate cake on one of the tables. U ask urself ""why couldn't i have that instead?""

Someone walks by and sees u looking longingly at the chocolate cake. They ask if u would rather have a piece of that. Ur so happy! Yes, of course! U are experiencing euphoria. U have something, and ur ok with it, but there's something else u would rather have

Now this probably sounds like it's only for binary people, but we all know there are more cakes than just apple and chocolate! U can mix and match, make ur own cake, decorate it however u want!

There u go, I hope this makes sense for anyone else, I just wanted to share

TL;DR with less cake: dysphoria is when u have something and don't like it. Euphoria is when u have something ur ok with, but feel so much better with something else

\- I think the only time that I was okay with my body was when I did sports and was extremely fit. Since I can no longer play sports I've gained weight so I'm not the biggest fan of my body.

2019-06-11 22:04:26,bziurt,0,3,"I've known I'm at least partially nonbinary for a couple years now, and over a year ago I came out at my work, which was a restaurant where I worked mostly in the back/kitchen. My friend there came out as a trans man (bigender but only close queer friends know that), and when I revealed to him that I'm nb, he kindly took it upon himself to come out for me, telling people when I'm not around to use they/them! I appreciated this a whole heckin lot, although it did kind of enable my shy/controntation issues.


Work and friends from work were my only social network, so I was surrounded by correct genderring for many months which gave me  euphoria until I decided to quit work to focus on going back to college. When my lab partners used ""she"", I was actually confused at first who they were referring to, but (here's me being STOPID), I decided not to tell them my pronouns. I *still* haven't told anyone at that community college or the university I transferred to this Spring (and now I'm unexpectedly close to recent lab group) anything gender-wise. And there's this girl in the group who almost seems to go out of her way to use gendered terms for me, and even though I feel pretty down from it, I don't correct her.


Why? Well....I'm loud, friendly, etc, but contradictingly extremely shy about things I deeply feel related to myself.


Here's my question/dilemma: I want to ""re-come out"", and it'd be my first time doing the work myself. I'm debating if it's worth it, and the scope of task i.e. strangers, certain people. What makes it more complicated is I'm not sure how much of my physical dysphoria stems from how others would gender those parts, and being perceived as having enough features to be allowed to count. There are some days/month every few months where I truly do see myself wanting to start low dose of T in future, then other time where I'm quite content with my body and that's a problem because of how feminine I like to present sometimes. Regardless of my body or presentation, I think of myself more in terms of a very girly bi buy (if I had to use gendered terms), and my female friendships, being called GURL, etc I see in relation to being the queer male friend, but I fear if I choose not to start T because of uncertainty, everyone around me won't get it.

My appearance will never get gendered correctly, meaning I would be committing to coming out all the time, and then there's the social element of knowing some people just won't use they/them (I'm in a mental health support group and some members have brain damage and I genuinely don't care what they call me) but there's the social anxiety of allies who know me interrupting the flow of the group meeting to go ""They! They!""



You know what? Just typing this has helped me work through that when I come out to people, that process just also has to include how to (not) react to misgendering! I can just tell people to think of me as a feminine guy if they must! I can just use words!!!!!!

Of course, I was vaguely aware of the idea that non-binary people are included under the trans umbrella if they’d like to be. It’s never crossed my mind that thats not a thing. But...somehow it never occurred to me that my own non-binary identity fell under Trans, too. 

I know it’s been talked to death, asked about, etc. but how do y’all identify/relate to the trans label and narrative? I’m struggling so hard right now. With fears (so many trans women and individuals harmed/killed this year alone), and with doubts (what if I’m “not trans enough”??). 

I guess I could mostly use some kind words. Some support. I’m putting myself and my partner through so much, and wishing I could just be cis-hetero for the sake of ease. Anyone who thinks we choose this is so fucking wrong. 

How could I choose to be this way? How could I choose to be afraid every time i step into a women’s rest room, on the off chance someone mistakes me for an amab trans person, or just a man?

Does anyone here have any experiences with deciding between breast reduction or top surgery? What questions did you ask, what pros/cons did you consider, and how did you come to your final decision?

I've been doing a lot of gender exploration lately, and based on my experiences with both gender dysphoria and euphoria, I think I might feel a lot better and more like myself if I ""masculinized"" my body somewhat with T and/or top surgery. (See my post history if you're curious) However, I struggle with whether or not I want to be seen as a binary man. I just have a really hard time imagining it, and I worry that it would feel just as constricting and false as being a binary ""woman"" feels. 

Here's the thing: I have broad shoulders, a large frame, and a deep voice already, and the men in my family are pretty hairy. And I'm not very femme in my presentation - not exactly butch, but I don't like makeup, prefer to wear men's clothes, etc. I'm fairly certain that, if I went on T, I would start passing as a cis man pretty quickly. So part of me is like ""well, sure, I could call myself non-binary, but if the world is going to see me as a man, what's the point?"" 

And I know that it's as much about how I see myself as how the world sees me, but part of my hesitation with transitioning is being put into the male *category.* My therapist once observed that my main identification with femaleness is through community/social ties and that's really important to me - I especially love connecting with queer women as a ... woman-adjacent person.

Anyway, that got long, but really, I would love to hear from AFAB transmasc ppl who don't identify as binary men - what's your thought process/journey been like?

A little background to this, my beliefs are probably best described as pagan and discovering this story was actually one thing that led to a major cognition on my gender journey.

Different versions of this story exist, and to me that's part of the beauty of stories with oral tradition; just as it was thousands of years ago, every individual's telling of the story is different, and this is mine. To my knowledge, and I'm far from an expert, a story a lot like the version presented here was widely told in the ancient city of Akkad around 3200 BC. (The Akkadian/Sumerian mythos is actually remarkably diverse, including binary trans and genderfluid rep as well)

I'm sure a lot of people here have heard of the story before, but I hope some of you find this interesting! I tried to write in a deliberately archaic style, I hope it's not overdone or overly awkward.

**The Descent of Inana**


Inana, draped in beads of lapis, abandoned the thrones of Heaven and Earth and descended to Kur-nu-gu, the place of no return, where the mortal dead linger in darkness. Clay be their bread, and mud their water, as is the decree of Ereshkigal who reigns as Queen in Kur-nu-gu.

Inana descended to Kur-nu-gu, the realm of Ereshkigal, around which the Queen of Kur-nu-gu had erected seven gates.

Inana spoke to Nehu, the gatekeeper, saying: ""Nehu, open up the gates of Kur-nu-gu, that I may look upon the face of my sister Ereshkigal.""

The gatekeeper Nehu made no motion, so Inana spoke again, saying: ""Let the gates be open so that I may enter, or I shall rend open the gates, leading up the dead to Earth, where they shall feast upon the living. Justice be my will, for Justice be mine to wield.""

Troubled, Nehu said: ""Wait, my Lady Inana, and I shall speak to my mistress Ereshkigal.""

So Nehu went from the gate to the house of his mistress Ereshkigal, saying: ""There is a lone girl at the gates of Kur-nu-gu, being your sister Inana. She has abandoned the thrones of Heaven and Earth and seeks admittance to Kur-nu-gu.""

Ereshkigal was enraged, but said: ""Nehu, return to the gates and admit my sister Inana. Bring her to my palace at Irkalla, that I may look upon her face, being sure that the ancient rites are upheld.""

Nehu left the house of his mistress and returned to the gates, saying unto Inana: ""My Lady Inana, the Queen Ereshkigal begs you entry.""

The first gate of Kur-nu-gu was opened, and Inana stepped through. Nehu took the beads of lapis from Inana.

And Inana was wroth, demanding: ""By what authority do you lay your hands upon me, who wields the sword of Justice, and in whose name all life springs forth?""

And Nehu said: ""In this place you have no authority, my Lady Inana. In the place of no return, my mistress Ereshkigal rules above all others. Be silent, and be satisfied that the ancient rites are upheld.""

The second gate of Kur-nu-gu was opened, and Inana stepped through. Nehu took the crown of Heaven from Inana's head.

Inana demanded: ""What is this?"" And Nehu said: ""Be silent, and be satisfied that the ancient rites are upheld.""

The third gate of Kur-nu-gu was opened, and Inana stepped through. Nehu took the emblem of the star from Inana's neck.

Inana demanded: ""What is this?"" And Nehu said: ""Be silent, and be satisfied that the ancient rites are upheld.""

The fourth gate of Kur-nu-gu was opened, and Inana stepped through. Nehu took the gold and jewels from Inana's wrists and fingers.

Inana demanded: ""What is this?"" And Nehu said: ""Be silent, and be satisfied that the ancient rites are upheld.""

The fifth gate of Kur-nu-gu was opened, and Inana stepped through. Nehu took the sandals from Inana's feet.

Inana demanded: ""What is this?"" And Nehu said: ""Be silent, and be satisfied that the ancient rites are upheld.""

The sixth gate of Kur-nu-gu was opened, and Inana stepped through. Nehu took the sacred golden belt of Ouroboros from Inana's waist. 

Inana demanded: ""What is this?"" And Nehu said: ""Be silent, and be satisfied that the ancient rites are upheld.""

The seventh gate of Kur-nu-gu was opened, and Inana stepped through. Nehu took the brilliant white robe from around Inana's body.

Inana demanded: ""What is this?"" And Nehu said: ""Be silent, and be satisfied that the ancient rites are upheld.""

And Inana stood alongside Nehu at Irkalla the throne of Ereshkigal, naked, stripped not only of her robe but also of the instruments of her authority, power, and justice.

Ereshkigal spoke her judgement: ""Fool sister, your authority is forfeit in this place. You willingly submit yourself to my will, and thus do I pass sentence upon you. Clay be your bread, and mud your water, as is my decree. The gates are sealed!""

And Ereshkigal called forth her vizier Namtar, the demon of the plagues. Namtar had the head of a viper and his body was skeletal, and he embraced Inana, causing sixty plagues to ravage her body.

And Inana was thrown into a cell, and the light disappeared from her eyes. She saw only darkness, and clay was her bread, and mud her water.

Great change came upon the earth. The rabbits of the field no longer bore forth young. Spouses no longer caressed, nor longed to lie together, and love was foreign to all the inhabitants of the Earth. The priests of Inana were mournful, for none wished to spend their time in song and merriment.

Papsukkal the brother of Inana was greatly troubled, and sought the counsel of the great god Enki.

Enki, in his wisdom, called forth a person from the dirt, being neither male nor female, and named them Asu-shu-namir, meaning ""shining one"".

Asu-shu-namir, being a creation of the great god Enki, freely walked through the gates of Kur-nu-gu and looked upon the face of Ereshkigal.

Ereshkigal was at once struck with lust for Asu-shu-namir, desiring greatly to lie with them.

Ereshkigal threw a tremendous feast in the name of Asu-shu-namir, offering up to them her finest wine.

But Asu-shu-namir was wise, and knew that to accept the offerings of the dead in their realm was to consign themself to Kur-nu-gu and the judgement of Ereshkigal.

Asu-shu-namir tasted neither meat nor wine in Kur-nu-gu, but danced sensually for Ereshkigal, enthralling her with their charms.

When Ereshkigal had imbued deeply of the wine, Asu-shu-namir drew close to Ereshkigal, saying: ""Mighty and beautiful Ereshkigal, is it not true that you guard the water of life? Nothing more have I ever longed to taste.""

Ereshkigal was overcome with longing, and ordered Namtar to offer up the water of life unto Asu-shu-namir.

When Ereshkigal had fallen into drunkenness, Asu-shu-namir took the water of life and stole to the cell of Inana. Asu-shu-namir sprinkled the water of life into the eyes of the Queen of Heaven.

And those eyes shone with a living radiance, and Inana awoke and fled through the seven gates of Kur-nu-gu, returning to the thrones of Heaven and Earth.

The earth blossomed with radiance, and the rabbits of the field brought forth young, and spouses longed to lie together. Love was upon the Earth, and the priests of Inana were gladdened at the return of song and merriment.

But Ereshkigal awakened as Asu-shu-namir was passing through the final gate of Kur-nu-gu, and declared her vengeance upon them, saying: ""In the shadows shall you abide, your kind condemned to darkness all their days.""

Asu-shu-namir was cast out of Kur-nu-gu, and returned to the Lady Inana, telling her of their plight.

And Inana consoled Asu-shu-namir, saying: ""Beloved Asu-shu-namir, even I may not remove the curse of Ereshkigal. Truly shall you abide in the shadows. But you have delivered me from the shadows of Kur-nu-gu, and my gratitude is ever yours. I pray that a measure of justice be done to you by my three blessings.""

""First, that you and those like you be blessed by prophecy. You shall have the wisdom of the stars, and herald the tidings of the planets.""

""Second, that you and those like you are given healing in your fingertips. As you restored me to the heavens, so to shall you restore life.""

""Third, that you and those like you are exalted as my priests. You shall carry my voice in your throats and my beauty in your hearts. And when the water of life is delivered from Kur-nu-gu, so too shall you be delivered from the curse of Ereshkigal. You shall lead the world into an exalted age. This be my decree, as Queen of Heaven.""",NonBinary,My own take on a story from ancient mythology with nonbinary representation,1560555008.0,"{'created_utc': 1560529808, 'id': 'c0m4z9', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 6, 'selftext': 'Hi everyone! &lt;3\n\nA little background to this, my beliefs are probably best described as pagan and discovering this story was actually one thing that led to a major cognition on my gender journey.\n\nDifferent versions of this story exist, and to me that\'s part of the beauty of stories with oral tradition; just as it was thousands of years ago, every individual\'s telling of the story is different, and this is mine.

I would like to learn about your personal and community experience. \n\nThe reason I am here is I keep hearing “enby” from other non binary people when I’ve never heard or seen posts about your experience. I only hear about your gender orientation or lack there of when it’s in reference to someone’s dating preference, sometimes bordering on fetishism, and honestly it really irritates me on a couple levels.  I’m also irritated at my own lack of exposure, that I don’t know about this community, your experience, and I want to understand it more.  \n\nI’d love to hear from you.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Please share your thoughts.', 'created': 1560556657.0}"

I (AFAB) recently got my name officially changed (whoop) to a neutral name. I'm overjoyed, but at the same time, I have no idea what I should do in terms of birth certificate, social security, drivers license, etc.   


I'm very much non-binary and generally apathetic in the way people view me, so in theory, I have no problem with just leaving everything as my birth sex. Minus the drivers license, because I'm lucky enough to live in a state that offers X, but even that might cause a bunch of confusion in other places.   


The problem lies in the fact that   
a) I am read mostly as the opposite sex now, so it makes interactions slightly awkward. It also leads to a lot of apologizing from people, which makes me feel bad lol.   


b) I am into competitive things like running, triathlons, etc., which group people by age and sex for performance reasons.   


I guess what I'm asking you guys is if anybody has experience with changing or not changing gender markers on official documents, that is into competitive sports? I know Ironman needs you to get a letter from your doctor saying you're on hormones if you're competing as the opposite gender and you also need documentation that supports the sex you plan on competing in.   


I don't really feel comfortable going full binary with everything, but I kind of get the feeling that's what needs to happen if I want to compete in these type of events. Especially since I've had surgery. Feels extremely awkward trying to run as a lady.

I also got my ears pierced today which was bomb af. Anyway, I'm staying with family right now and this is the first time they've really seen me lookin' femme. I came out as gay to them like 12 months ago (which went fine). But now I'm back and its pretty bad. They are really clearly uncomfortable (as is my extended family). I tried to wear makeup a couple days ago and my mom asked me not to (""Do you *have* to wear makeup today?""). So that sucked but they I was like fuck this I want to dress femme so I'm gonna dress femme. So today I wore a blouse and a kilt (I've been wearing a kilt for the last 3 years even when I was presenting super masc) and did a full face of makeup. It's been pretty shitty. Nobody has really confronted me super hard or anything, it's just the sidelong looks and the general weirdness. My dad kinda just laughed and didn't know how to deal with it but he's pretty accepting. I was getting hot flashes yesterday (figured out it was cause I missed some days on my SSRI) but I mentioned it to my mom and she asked very sharply if I was on estrogen (I am not cause I'm pretty sure I don't want to go that far femme). Then today I heard her talking to my aunt (like 5 feet away) like I couldn't hear like ""why is he wearing makeup? I think it's best just to let it play out."" She later asked me if I was ""just experimenting or was it something else,"" and then like an hour later was telling me I should do my eyeliner like the lady at the piercing place does it because ""the way I do it makes it look like I'm doing it for a joke."" That was all shitty but the weirdest part was dealing with all the reactions of people who didn't know what to say.

But now I\'m back and its pretty bad. They are really clearly uncomfortable (as is my extended family). I tried to wear makeup a couple days ago and my mom asked me not to (""Do you *have* to wear makeup today?""). So that sucked but they I was like fuck this I want to dress femme so I\'m gonna dress femme. So today I wore a blouse and a kilt (I\'ve been wearing a kilt for the last 3 years even when I was presenting super masc) and did a full face of makeup. It\'s been pretty shitty. Nobody has really confronted me super hard or anything, it\'s just the sidelong looks and the general weirdness. My dad kinda just laughed and didn\'t know how to deal with it but he\'s pretty accepting. I was getting hot flashes yesterday (figured out it was cause I missed some days on my SSRI) but I mentioned it to my mom and she asked very sharply if I was on estrogen (I am not cause I\'m pretty sure I don\'t want to go that far femme). Then today I heard her talking to my aunt (like 5 feet away) like I couldn\'t hear like ""why is he wearing makeup? I think it\'s best just to let it play out."" She later asked me if I was ""just experimenting or was it something else,"" and then like an hour later was telling me I should do my eyeliner like the lady at the piercing place does it because ""the way I do it makes it look like I\'m doing it for a joke."" That was all shitty but the weirdest part was dealing with all the reactions of people who didn\'t know what to say. I just wanted to hide in my room forever, which is abnormal for me cause I\'m usually good with people.\n\nUpdate: I didn\'t get to post this until after dinner and dinner went fine so I feel a bit better. Still not looking forward to my mom asking me not to wear makeup to the very somber family event tomorrow. Just feels like ass because I\'m in my mid-20s and I still feel like a kid with this kind of stuff.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': ""Hey Y'all I need to Vent a Bit"", 'created': 1560599715.0}"

I've been seeing a therapist because of anxiety and depression. It was really difficult to find someone who 1) took my insurance, 2) was accepting new patients, and 3) had availability that worked with my schedule. I don't know that this therapist is the best fit for me, for a number of reasons, but I'm at a point where I'm not in a crisis situation but I do need treatment and am concerned about my anxiety getting worse if I don't get help now, so I feel like I at least need to hang in there for now, at least until I see a doctor about starting medication and see how that goes.

I've also had mixed experiences when seeking out trans-friendly therapists in the past. While I really like the idea of eventually finding a good gender therapist whom I can talk to about my dysphoria and gender/sexuality feelings, I don't feel like that's something I *need* right now, and I don't want my gender to become a bigger deal than the things that I actually need help with.

I'm non binary &amp; afab, and my partner is a cis man.

I have never ever wanted to become pregnant and/or give birth, but I would like to be a parent one day. We know we want to adopt in the future, and I know we'll make great parents. 

My partner recently mentioned how excited he is to become a dad one day. This is great, since we are both on the same page about parenthood, but it made me think....

What will our children call me? The idea of being called ""mom"" makes me feel uneasy. I'm still trying to figure out my place in society, as I've only come out to certain people within the last year. I've felt ""different"" my whole life, but have only found the vocabulary to define my gender as of recently.

I also dont want to be called ""dad"". While I'm gender fluid, I typically present more towards the femme end of the spectrum and the idea of being called ""dad"" just doesn't feel right. 

My question is... If the title of ""mom"" and ""dad"" both make me feel uneasy... then what should my future children call me? By my name? Should they call me ""parental unit""?

Okay, so up until the age of about 12 or 13, I didn't feel at all weird about both my gender, or sexuality. (I grew my hair out at around 10 I beleive, but that was just because I thought it looked cool, and even though I was called a girl sometimes because of it, I didn't really think much of it, and I didn't even mind it that much.) But anyway, as soon as puberty started for me, I believe that was when I first started questioning things. Like for example, it felt (and still feels) wrong for me to have hair in specific places, so I tried to cut it a few times, which didn't really help me that much...

For as long as I can remember, I hated my chest. (For reference, I basically don't have one, it's flat even for guy standards.) And I've always felt uncomfortable with being topless, I would never change around other people, I would wear a t-shirt whenever I had to wear a bathing suit at the beach, and whenever I had to take my clothes off at a doctor's appointment, I was extremely uncomfortable the entire time.

I've also never liked dressing up. I absolutely HATE wearing a suit, or really wearing anything ""masculine"" I hate the ""men's"" deodorant, soap, literally anything like that. I think it smells gross, I think it looks bad on me, I hate all of it.

But even after all of this, I don't exactly feel like I should be a girl. I think that would make me non-binary, but I don't know. I do really like the whole ""Femboy"" thing though, so maybe I'm that, presenting myself more female, but still being male.

2019-06-16 16:04:12,c1biap,14,13,"Hello, enby folks! I'm a bisexual cis man (slightly nonconforming sometimes) in an open polyamorous relationship with multiple partners.

Some of these partners are nonbinary, but they have different preferences when it comes to pronouns, labels, and overall gender dynamics in our respective relationships.

One prefers to take on roles that have traditionally been regarded as masculine, one tends toward more feminine coded roles, and another does both. I grew up in an open minded household, but I wasn't introduced to the concept of nonbinary genders until a couple years ago, so I'm still learning how a lot of these things work. I want to understand what roles I should have in each of my relationships, and I want to do what I can to make sure my partners feel as comfortable as possible. Relationships, after all, are about finding a good balance between all participants.

Also, and this is what I most need help with, not all of my nonbinary partners prefer to use they/them pronouns all the time. One goes by ei/em/eir, while another goes by xey/xem, etc. I was only introduced to more complex pronoun politics fairly recently, so I often have trouble with them. I've finally gotten the hang of they/them, but other nonbinary pronouns just don't stick for me, no matter how hard I try.

In addition to pronouns, some of them wish to be called my ""datemate,"" or ""partner,"" or ""theyfriend."" It's a lot to keep track of, and I already have pretty significant memory problems as it is, so it's even more of a challenge for me.

My question is, how do I keep track of all this information when I am in a romantic or sexual relationship with so many people with different preferences? I really care about all of my partners, even if we're in the early stages of dating or even being FWBs; I definitely don't want to subject anyone to dysphoria if I can help it, and I want to be as thoughtful a boyfriend and partner as I can be.

I\'m a bisexual cis man (slightly nonconforming sometimes) in an open polyamorous relationship with multiple partners.\n\nSome of these partners are nonbinary, but they have different preferences when it comes to pronouns, labels, and overall gender dynamics in our respective relationships.\n\nOne prefers to take on roles that have traditionally been regarded as masculine, one tends toward more feminine coded roles, and another does both. I grew up in an open minded household, but I wasn\'t introduced to the concept of nonbinary genders until a couple years ago, so I\'m still learning how a lot of these things work. I want to understand what roles I should have in each of my relationships, and I want to do what I can to make sure my partners feel as comfortable as possible.

2019-06-16 18:11:14,c1cy4k,7,3,"Heya! 
A couple of weeks ago I began to question my gender, and recently came to the conclusion that I’m probably a demigirl. For context, I’m AFAB, and I’ve always been quite the oddball. My interests between “girly” stuff and “manly” stuff have fluctuated greatly ever since I was younger. I currently find myself stuck in the middle. Even though I’ve begun to identify as a demigirl and now prefer for people to use not just she/her but also they/them, I still feel uncertain. 

I’ve read up many stories and asks on this sub and other sites about people asking about being Demi, however I’m not sure if I specifically relate to every feeling other AFAB demigirls have. 

For example: I can relate to the desire to want to wear less feminine clothing and have variety, not wanting a super feminine attitude but not a masculine one either (for me personally the other part of my gender would be non-specific), liking the idea of using both she and they pronouns, etc.
However, I don’t seem to feel a lot of other things that AFAB demigirls often express for example: heavily disliking their chests (I don’t care that I have a decently sized chest and don’t feel the need to bind/feel dysphoric about it), I don’t dislike any of my outer more feminine features (Again, to me it makes no difference whether I have them or not), etc.

I wanted some advice from other fellow demigirls and their experiences to see if I have finally found the fight identification for myself. A while ago, I had come to terms with the fact that I’m asexual, which is what prompted me to start thinking more about my gender. 
I know that there aren’t specific “criteria” or highly specific signs that validate an individual as Demi, but I still am unsure if the way I look or the fact that I don’t really experience dysphoria will make others say I’m not actually Demi. 

Any advice is appreciated!

(I'm asking here before I ask in trans forums, because I feel more nonbinary than ""traditional"" trans) I'm AFAB and am very female-bodied; I'm very busty and have some hips and booty. But I've been binding more and want to present more male these days. 

Ever since I can recall, in my nighttime dreams, I am (usually) a man. Therefore, I often have dreams involving male genitalia or sexual dreams where I am male. I obviously cannot actually imagine having a penis on my body so my dream brain makes the best of it. 

I'm curious if wearing a packer might help me *feel* more male and enhance my dream-body-image. Long story short, I'm not interested on going on T at this time. 

So. Can anyone recommend a brand of packer? I know they come in various grades. Some are less realistic and cheaper. Are the expensive ones worth it? 

Have you worn one in public and do you find that you have to adjust? Did you use a harness? Did anything chafe? Any experiences people would like to share? Did you wear women's or mens pants? Can either work?

&amp;#x200B;

I don’t want to write about you anymore.

Sometimes I wish you weren’t such a large part of me. Sometimes I wish that my existence wasn’t defined by you. I sometimes wonder what it would be like if I didn’t think about you day in and day out. I’m not sure I want to be with you anymore. Because, honestly, you’re taking over my life.

I want you to be part of me, but it’s hard. You take over me, you are the only thing that I feel defines me anymore.

How do I define myself when the labels are constantly changing? How do I define myself when I know I’m not accepted by you? How do I define myself when I know that no words can explain how I feel- that the abstract concepts in my mind will never be able to be truly expressed because I know you won’t understand?

And so, I don’t want to write about you anymore. Because sometimes I wish you weren’t a part of me.

I wish I could just exist. The way you tell me to be loud and proud isn’t *me.* I try, I do. But how can I kiss her when all your eyes are on me, all my friends whose one time to be themselves is here, how do I live up to such an expectation when I don’t even know what I expect of myself? When I don’t know truly who I am? I want to be alone with her, but the feeling to be out next to you is too overwhelming. I want to kiss her, but I can’t with all eyes towards me.

I wish you weren’t all I ever think about. All that I could be doing and choose not to, all I could be changing and decide to be lazy. How can I be loud and proud when I’m quiet? When my natural state is not at rallies, even though my heart wants to be there, is confusing. My head and heart are at war with each other. One wants to celebrate, tell off everyone opposing you. The other wants to sit down and read with my cat by my side. But more and more, I’ve been starting to lose that other part- fitting into a form of what you expect from me. How do I make a difference but still be quiet, when silence is an active form of oppression against those I care about?

I don’t want to write about you anymore. I don’t want to think about you, have every minute of every hour of every day defined by you. If I were in the right mind, I’d tear down your symbols from my room. Because all I want is to exist. Where I don’t need a name, a title, something for people to define me by. I just want to be me.

And if I keep by you, still, I’ll never get peace.

I’ll never get peace because I don’t understand myself. And to survive in your world, I have to. I have to tell everyone who I am. I just want this to be mine. But now I have to share it with everyone else. I’ll have to tell them to, even though I just want to be alone. Or with her. Everyone expects so much of me now. They expect me to be a certain way, to be a certain someone. I just want this to be my own, before it was tainted by the opinions of others and my own self-pity. I just want this to be my own, kept in a lockbox behind my heart. No matter how much I deny it, I know that you’re still a part of me. I just wish we didn’t have to tell everyone about it.

Disclaimer: descriptions of sexual nature.

I dress quite androgynous and only wear colours black, red and gold (jewelry, details on shoes..). So it appears quite neat and really neither/both feminine and masculine. Though people have a tendency to sometimes point out I ""dress as if I were a guy"". When I was younger I always wished to buy guy clothes but I weren't allowed (though those clothes were androgynous as well). I try to appear completely flat-chested, which isn't hard at all as I could literally put a dress shirt on and appear flat. It's harder with tighter clothes such as jumpers, which I absolutely love so that's a bit unfortunate. I always felt uncomfortable when it came to my chest and am pretty happy I'm almost flat-chested. Sometimes I wish I had no chest at all and sometimes I'm content with its appearance as it is (it's pretty unnoticable even by me most of the time as it's that flat, but I still feel the discomfort, especially if others can see it). I'm not sure whether I'd like to have a top surgery though, and not sure whether it has anything to do with it, but I'm autistic and have a problem with changes.

I don't feel comfortable being seen as a girl, and I always present as a guy online. I even have a pseudonim, Mikhail (Mee-kale). Though my birth name is a unisex one, so that's a plus. I always play male characters in games, would take male roles irl and would relate to guys more during my life. I have better connections with guys than with girls. With girls it's sort of shallow and I don't feel comfortable being emotionally vulnerable or touchy with them, while I'm perfectly comfortable with guys. My best friend is a guy and guy friends are the only ones I've ever been emotionally intimate with. 

I'm quite dominant in nature and am sort of annoyed by passive submissiveness. Which is the description of most girls I met lol. So that's another reason I may not click with girls that much. Also perhaps TMI, but I'm always the penetrator in my fantasies (of guys) and am pretty much just ""attracted"" to sexually submissive males. I'm on the asexual spectrum and have very little to no interest to pursue those fantasies (I may be aegosexual or something, I don't really care I just go by asexual). I'm also 100% aromantic. Not sure whether any of this plays a role in how I perceive myself. This is another reason I'm a bit uncomfortable being perceived as a girl, as people associate girls with sexual submissiveness which is the farthest from the truth in my case. I'm perhaps 1% a sub at most, and even then I would be penetrated in the ass as a guy would. This is also the reason I feel uncomfortable about my reproductive system, the fact that I can get pregnant and also the fact that I was biologically predestined to be the penetrated one. It happens that I get quite uncomfortable having the genitals I do, but I don't really wish I had a penis either. It's quite confusing.

I have no problem with any pronouns tbh, but I prefer she/her irl as I'm biologically female and he/him online. And I don't really feel comfortable presenting as non-binary. 

I sort of see myself as a guy, but also as a girl and neither at the same time, and it varies. But the aforementioned characteristics of me always stay the same. I wouldn't go by another gender whether irl or online even if I realised I weren't cis as it feels unnecessary to me. I'm just trying to figure this out. I'm pretty sure I'm cis though, but idk.

2019-06-17 23:11:43,c1um7b,2,2,"Hi all,

With mod permission, I wanted to share the info below about an online survey about AFAB trans folks' experiences accessing reproductive health care, and to invite you all to participate! The survey is for people of trans experience who are AFAB, age 18+, and live in the US. If you're part of the PRIDE Study, you may have already gotten an invite through that platform.

The researchers built the study in collaboration with a community advisory team of AFAB nonbinary folks and trans men (including me). While it's not perfect, we've worked hard to make the survey as inclusive and validating as possible -- for example, you can indicate what words you use for your body and the survey questions will mirror that language.

It would be amazing to have your experiences reflected in the study -- and if you have thoughts about the survey itself, I'm happy to answer questions or to pass feedback on to the team. (And please feel free to share the info elsewhere if you're comfortable doing so!)

Here's the official blurb:

Ibis Reproductive Health and The PRIDE Study are proud to launch a new survey to learn about the sexual and reproductive health care needs and experiences of transgender and gender expansive (TGE) people assigned female at birth. We are committed to hearing directly from those of us in the transgender and gender-expansive community to learn how to better meet all of our sexual and reproductive health care needs. Our study team worked closely with a community advisory team to develop a survey that affirms the diverse identities, experiences, and language that those of trans and/or gender-expansive experience use to define their experiences for themselves. We want to reach as many eligible people as possible to participate in this innovative study. You can participate in the survey here, and please feel free to share the opportunity widely with your networks.

2019-06-17 23:57:37,c1v3qu,5,6,"Hi I'm new to Reddit so I'm really sorry if I'm doing this wrong but I need to let this all out. I'm a mess haha.  


Born female. Have always felt for a long time I would be better off a male. Kind of realizing now that I just don’t “fit” into the female box and I am vehemently denying it and am considering surgery to appear more feminine, but also am apprehensive in case I actually want to transition down the road to male. I go through phases where I wanna be super feminine and attractive so I can fit in to society better. Other times, I am okay with being somewhat androgynous, but would prefer being more conventionally attractive. Other times, I just wanna be a full-blown hunky dude, and I’m already half way there so I might as well embrace it.  
 

I experience dysphoria in weird ways, which makes me feel invalid compared to most people. Like I don’t look at my tits in the mirror and want to cry. My body isn’t super feminine to begin with so maybe that’s why? (Broad shoulders, narrow hips, wide rib cage, muscular). But whenever I see a picture of a trans man I just kinda burst into tears, as if I’m looking at what I’m meant to be. That said, I am super apprehensive to start any sort of hormones because I already have a lot of anger issues, and I am scared of what may happen. I’ve heard horror stories of being on T and just being super angry for no reason.  
   
 I’d also like to mention, I still have a lot of feminine interests and am not sure if that would be at odds with my male identity, were I to transition. Y’know, baking, cute stuff, decorating, that sort of thing. But other than that, my interests, mannerisms, and general demeanor can be categorized as “male”. I mostly hang out with guys and feel extremely uncomfortable around girls, because I can’t really relate to them. I often have fantasies of being like my male friends and blending in with them. I virtually fail in all aspects of trying to be feminine, and whenever I try to be (like putting on makeup, trying to dress cute, etc) I feel like an imposter. But also wearing more masculine clothing just makes me feel like a stereotype.   
 

The societal pressure of needing to be attractive and fit into the female box has been killing me for years and it’s finally coming to a head and I just really want to burst out of it. I’m also too stuck in thinking in binaries and assigning different interests or behaviors to genders, just because of how our society works. I want to come out as NB and try to “own it”, but am too afraid of standing out too much or being stereotyped as “confused” or “attack helicopter” or whatever else people say about NB people. Being bullied for most of my life and having extreme social anxiety and agoraphobia will do that to you I guess. I also don’t really go by any special pronouns, for that reason. Even though I feel like I should.  
 

I am scared and confused and don’t know what I am and I feel like I’m not valid enough to be considered trans or non binary haha help me. Again I’m really sorry if I posted this in the wrong place but I really want some insight on this. I’m tired of hiding and being in denial.",NonBinary,"I'm new, confused, and in need of support.

I mostly hang out with guys and feel extremely uncomfortable around girls, because I can’t really relate to them. I often have fantasies of being like my male friends and blending in with them. I virtually fail in all aspects of trying to be feminine, and whenever I try to be (like putting on makeup, trying to dress cute, etc) I feel like an imposter. But also wearing more masculine clothing just makes me feel like a stereotype.   \n \n\nThe societal pressure of needing to be attractive and fit into the female box has been killing me for years and it’s finally coming to a head and I just really want to burst out of it. I’m also too stuck in thinking in binaries and assigning different interests or behaviors to genders, just because of how our society works. I want to come out as NB and try to “own it”, but am too afraid of standing out too much or being stereotyped as “confused” or “attack helicopter” or whatever else people say about NB people. Being bullied for most of my life and having extreme social anxiety and agoraphobia will do that to you I guess. I also don’t really go by any special pronouns, for that reason. Even though I feel like I should.  \n \n\nI am scared and confused and don’t know what I am and I feel like I’m not valid enough to be considered trans or non binary haha help me. Again I’m really sorry if I posted this in the wrong place but I really want some insight on this.

2019-06-18 16:48:07,c24lop,10,5,"For so long, I've struggled with my gender identity, and I've never found anything that I truly identify with. I always have this feeling of being stuck in the middle, this particular mix of masculine and feminine, and I  have been at odds with my gender because of this. I say that I am a ""futch"" or soft butch to try and explain how I feel, but at times, those don't feel right either. So, it makes me wonder if I am non-binary or not.

As a child, I did do a lot of traditionally feminine things. I wore dresses, played with dolls, and things of that nature. But, around the age of nine, I started growing breasts and during a talk with my mother, I cried about it. I hated the idea of growing breasts and wearing bras. I also intensely hated the pubic hair growing between my legs and shaved it off, in secret, stealing the razor from my dad. After a bit I got used to the fact, and moved on, figuring it was just a part of life. When I got to my teens years, another revelation became apparent, and I learned I wasn't straight. I identified as bisexual at first, and came out as lesbian in my twenties. All the while, I struggled with gender. I felt so much confusion and maybe denial. I wrote it off as a queer thing, but it still loomed over my head and still left more questions than answers, like something wasn't complete. Now, at age thirty-five, I feel like I can't write it off any more. I just really want to figure myself out.

As said before, I feel stuck in the middle. I don't feel feminine enough when it comes to feminine straight women and femme lesbians and I don't feel masculine enough to be hard butch. I know with butch lesbian friends, and a late friend who was a straight tomboy, they were far more masculine than me. Same goes for feminine women in my life. I feel like I can't relate, that their experiences are so foreign to me. I feel so alone in this regard, and I feel sort of like an outcast, always outside looking in. 

On the inside, I do feel this mix of both, and it shows itself in different ways and at different times. The first time I ever wore a shirt and tie, -was one of the very few times I ever felt beautiful. Leather jackets and Chucks are a part of my fashion bible. On the hand, I love painting my nails, coloring my hair and wearing floral perfume. My ideal outfit would be a stylish three-piece suit with little feminine details. I'm a writer, and when I write male characters, I feel such a sense of freedom, and I almost live vicariously through it, but in my non-writing life, I do love being in women's spaces and that feeling is warm and renewing. When it comes to gender, I relate to figures like David Bowie, Freddie Mercury, and Anne Lister. Another thing I really relate to, is actually the show ""Steven Universe."" It's especially with the Gems themselves. I loved seeing Pearl in a tux, given that she's normally one of the more feminine Gems, and seeing Garnet in her wedding dress that was a mash-up of a  traditional wedding dress and tux really inspired me. These things really do speak to me and have been something to relate to. These things are the rare occasion where I see myself.

The biggest reason I tried my best to push away my gender problems is because I do identify as a lesbian. I love being a lesbian, and I do love being a part of the WLW community. I always had this feeling that if my gender was different, I would lose that, and I don't want that. It's the one thing in my life that I am the most sure about. I'm a person that questions myself often and try my best to realize certain things about myself. I like self-discovery.

Now, the one thing I do know, is that I am not trans. I have no real desire to be a man, and even if I did, I couldn't transition. I'm not allowed hormones due to being a cancer patient. I did try packing once, as a personal experiment, and I didn't like it. So, I at least know that much.

My child has come out to me as non-binary. They are nine years old. They have opted not to tell their father (we are divorced) or my male significant other and are comfortable with both female and neutral pronouns.

&amp;#x200B;

I am feeling extremely proud that my child felt confident enough to come out to me. I asked them if there were any other changes they would like to make such as cutting their hair, going by a different name, etc. They expressed that they feel comfortable with their appearance and name, so we're good there. A few months ago, they expressed their desire to wear masculine/neutral clothing styles, so we had already updated their wardrobe with their preferred styles.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything else I can do for my child right now? I ordered an NB pride flag for them to hang in their bedroom. We just moved to a big house and they now have their own room and don't have to share with their little brother. :)

[Live version.](https://youtu.be/Ls7FEAZznCo)

---
Andrew

When I was a kid I would sometimes secretly call myself Andrew,
would tug at the crotch of my pants the way only pubescent boys do,
ran around pounding on my bare chest like Tarzan.
It's not that I thought I'd grow up to be a man;
I just never thought I'd grow up to be a woman either.
From what I could tell neither of those categories seemed to fit me.
But believe me, I knew from a very young age never to say,
“Hey dad, this Adam and Eve thing isn't really working for me;
I mean, what about all the people in between?”

In the third grade Lynette Lyons asked me where all of my Barbies were.
I lied and told her I got in trouble so my mom took them away.
I didn't dare say, “Barbie sucks, Lynette!
And for that matter Tommy, so does GI Joe.”
I wanna grow into something none of us have ever seen before.
And gender is just one of the ways we're boxed in and labeled
before we're ever able to speak who we believe we are
or who we dream we'll become.
Like drumbeats forever changing their rhythm
I am living today as someone I had not yet become yesterday
and tonight I will borrow only pieces of who I am today
to carry with me to tomorrow.
No, I'm not gay.
No, I'm not straight.
And I'm sure as hell not bisexual, damn it.
I am whoever I am when I am it,
loving whoever you are when the stars shine
and whoever you'll be when the sun rises.
Yes, I like girls.
Yes, I like boys.
Yes, I like boys who like boys.
I like girls who wear toys and girls who don't,
girls who don't call themselves girls,
crew cuts or curls or that really bad hair phase in between

I like steam rising from the body of a one-night stand.
I like holding hands for three months before kissing.
I like wishing your body was Saturn,
my body a thousand rings wrapped around you.
You wanted to be a Buddhist nun once.
Last night you held my cervix between your fingers.
I thanked gods I don't believe in for your changing.

Tell me we'll be naming our children beautiful and nothing else.
Tell Barbie she can go now.
Tell GI Joe to put his gun down and find a boyfriend,
or a girlfriend,
or a girl/boyfriend.
fuck it, GI Joe just needs a friend, y'all.
I mean, he's plastic,
and not even the kind of plastic that bends.
I want to bend in a thousand directions,
like the sun does,
like love does,
like time stopped
so the hands of the clock could hold each other.

And we held each other like I held these words
for too many years on the tip of my tongue.
I am my mother's daughter.
I am midnight's sun.
You can find me on the moon
waxing and waning,
my heart full of petals,
every single one begging:
love me, love me, love me,
whoever I am,
whoever I become,
love me, love me, love me. ",NonBinary,Andrew by Andrea Gibson,1560983374.0,"{'created_utc': 1560958174, 'id': 'c2ihbx', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""Andrea Gibson is an amazing (slam) poet and I thought I'd share this wonderful poem with y'all.\n[Live version.](https://youtu.be/Ls7FEAZznCo)\n\n---\nAndrew\n\nWhen I was a kid I would sometimes secretly call myself Andrew,\nwould tug at the crotch of my pants the way only pubescent boys do,\nran around pounding on my bare chest like Tarzan.\nIt's not that I thought I'd grow up to be a man;\nI just never thought I'd grow up to be a woman either.\nFrom what I could tell neither of those categories seemed to fit me.\nBut believe me, I knew from a very young age never to say,\n“Hey dad, this Adam and Eve thing isn't really working for me;\nI mean, what about all the people in between?”\n\nIn the third grade Lynette Lyons asked me where all of my Barbies were.\nI lied and told her I got in trouble so my mom took them away.\nI didn't dare say, “Barbie sucks, Lynette!\nAnd for that matter Tommy, so does GI Joe.”\nI wanna grow into something none of us have ever seen before.\nAnd gender is just one of the ways we're boxed in and labeled\nbefore we're ever able to speak who we believe we are\nor who we dream we'll become.\nLike drumbeats forever changing their rhythm\nI am living today as someone I had not yet become yesterday\nand tonight I will borrow only pieces of who I am today\nto carry with me to tomorrow.\nNo, I'm not gay.\nNo, I'm not straight.\nAnd I'm sure as hell not bisexual, damn it.\nI am whoever I am when I am it,\nloving whoever you are when the stars shine\nand whoever you'll be when the sun rises.\nYes, I like girls.\nYes, I like boys.\nYes, I like boys who like boys.\nI like girls who wear toys and girls who don't,\ngirls who don't call themselves girls,\ncrew cuts or curls or that really bad hair phase in between\n\nI like steam rising from the body of a one-night stand.\nI like holding hands for three months before kissing.\nI like wishing your body was Saturn,\nmy body a thousand rings wrapped around you.\nYou wanted to be a Buddhist nun once.\nLast night you held my cervix between your fingers.\nI thanked gods I don't believe in for your changing.\n\nTell me we'll be naming our children beautiful and nothing else.\nTell Barbie she can go now.\nTell GI Joe to put his gun down and find a boyfriend,\nor a girlfriend,\nor a girl/boyfriend.\nfuck it, GI Joe just needs a friend, y'all.\nI mean, he's plastic,\nand not even the kind of plastic that bends.\nI want to bend in a thousand directions,\nlike the sun does,\nlike love does,\nlike time stopped\nso the hands of the clock could hold each other.\n\nAnd we held each other like I held these words\nfor too many years on the tip of my tongue.\nI am my mother's daughter.\nI am midnight's sun.\nYou can find me on the moon\nwaxing and waning,\nmy heart full of petals,\nevery single one begging:\nlove me, love me, love me,\nwhoever I am,\nwhoever I become,\nlove me, love me, love me.\xa0"", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Andrew by Andrea Gibson', 'created': 1560983374.0}"

2019-06-19 16:52:01,c2jhbk,0,1,"**First, how much does Bicalutamide increase T by?**  
At doses between 10mg to 200mg, there is anywhere from a 21-73% increase in T regardless, so lets just say there is a 50% average increase in T from bicalutamide.  


**How much androgens(T + DHT) does bicalutamide block?**  
""sufficiently high relative concentrations of bicalutamide (1,000- fold excess) are able to completely prevent activation of the AR by androgens like DHT and testosterone and subsequent [upregulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation) of the [transcription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_transcription) of androgen-responsive [genes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene) and associated effects.[\[39\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology_of_bicalutamide#cite_note-Furr1997-39)[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology_of_bicalutamide#cite_note-FurrTucker1996-20)[\[40\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology_of_bicalutamide#cite_note-pmid8717469-40)[\[41\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology_of_bicalutamide#cite_note-FiggChau2010-41) At steady-state, relative to the normal adult male range for testosterone levels (300–1,000 ng/dL),[\[42\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology_of_bicalutamide#cite_note-ChappleSteers2011-42) circulating concentrations of bicalutamide at 50 mg/day are roughly 600 to 2,500 times higher and at 150 mg/day around 1,500 to 8,000 times higher than circulating testosterone levels""  


if you do the math then 50mg would reach a 1,000 fold excess for &lt;500ng/dl of testosterone   
and 100mg would reach a 1,000 fold excess for &lt;1000ng/dl of testosterone  
and 150mg would reach a 1,500 fold excess for &lt;1500ng/dl of testosterone   
(this is assuming you are not using something to reduce DHT) aka using bicalutamide by itself  


**What if I am using something to lower DHT? (**[**finasteride**](https://www.hairlosstalk.com/treatments/propecia/)**/dutasteride)**  
lets just assume someone is using dutasteride to reduce their DHT by 95% and assume that there is no DHT in the body, only T.  


Well ""DHT is a [potent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)) [agonist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist) of the AR, and is in fact the most potent known [endogenous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogenous) [ligand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand_(biochemistry)) of the receptor. It has an [affinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_(pharmacology)) (Kd) of 0.25 to 0.5 nM for the human AR, which is about 2- to 3-fold higher than that of [testosterone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone) (Kd = 0.4 to 1.0 nM)""  


So we can be aggressive and assume that the Kd (affinity) of Testosterone: 0.4nM  
and the Kd (affinity) of DHT: 0.25nM.  


So if someone was using dutasteride (or finasteride) then they could use a lower dose of bicalutamide since they are only blocking T. DHT has a 2-3 fold higher binding affinity of testosterone so more bicalutamide is required to block it from the AR if DHT is not being blocked already.  


**I'm on dutasteride, so how much Testosterone does bicalutamide block?**  
well since we don't have to worry about DHT, we have to reapply the math on the affinity of testosterone vs dht to see how much bicalutamide is required to only block T from the AR.  


0.4nM/0.25nM=1.6 as a ratio  


so we do  
500ng/dl\*1.6=800ng/dl  
1000ng/dl\*1.6=1600ng/dl  
1500ng/dl\*1.6=2400ng/dl  


so that means  


50mg bicalutamide blocks - 800ng/dl of testosterone  
100mg bicalutamide blocks - 1,600ng/dl of testosterone  
150mg bicalutamide blocks - 2,400ng/dl of testosterone  


it is important that you do not take an SAA with bicalutamide since it will interfere with the drug (SAA's are partial agonists of the AR)  


if you use tamoxifen then there will be an additional 50% increase in T   
and if you use raloxifene there will be an additional 20% increase in T  


**how I chose my dose of bicalutamide**  
my total testosterone on my last blood test was 913ng/dl.  
so if I take bica my T will go up 50% and raloxifine will also increase my T by 20%  
so 913\*1.7=1552ng/dl  


Im also on dutasteride so I can look at the second chart which shows I can take only 100mg bicalutamide.

I'm AMAB and I'm pretty sure I'm not cis. I've been reading about gender identity and came to the conclusion that I'm probably non binary, but I'm not sure.

The thing is, I'm masculine most of the time and I'm okay with male pronouns. I don't really feel the need for gender neutral pronouns, I'm okay with people using whatever they like.

Although I feel masculine ""most of the time"", I want to feel less masculine at times. And those times are harder and harder to ignore...

So, my question is, am I really NB or something else?

\----

My hair texture is...unusual, to say the least. Somewhere between 3 and 4 on the Norwood scale, just the receded hairline, no other baldspots. It's very fine and very thin, mostly straight on the scalp. Thick, wavy on the sides. Also the hair from my scalp is extremely slow growing compared to the hair on the sides of my head, often feeling like it hits a 'maximum' length of 5 inches.

Tends towards being very dry. I rarely shampoo it, but condition it several times a week. Usually when i do shampoo it, it is a dry, crispy mess for days.

It's always been a real pain to manage so I've generally just given up and gone with an extremely short cut despite having always wanted long hair.

I actually had it long at one point, but I had no idea how to care for it and it didnt look great. The uneven thickness gave me the 'pyramid' look, among other issues.

Recently, I've been. wanting to try again, and I'm willing to put in however much care into my hair regimen as it needs, I just need some pointers to even know where to begin.

2019-06-23 00:57:55,c3x67j,3,7,"i thought telling people i was nonbinary and preferred they/them pronouns would help my depression. i was so fucking wrong. my dysphoria has gotten exponentially worse very quickly and i'm very much unequipped to deal with it.

it's not even that people are unsupportive. i havent faced anyone yet who refused to acknowledge my gender. my parents and work friends say they're trying to call me by the right things though they mess up more often than not. even so, i'm noticing every single fucking time someone calls me a she or uses my birth name, and it instantly has me feeling really down for at least an hour, not wanting to speak and trying not to cry. and i'm realizing that i'm NEVER going to pass as androgynous enough to not have binary pronouns used for me, so this dysphoria will probably never go away.

I thought I was meant to be female and wanted to transition for most of my life.   But I never did.   I have always been nonconforming when I could over the years.   

Upon realizing I was gender fluid and non-binary, I finally was able to be comfortable in my body as is.   I wanted to be able to present myself feminine.  And now that I have been doing it more than ever before, I feel right. 

I still would like a female body but I don’t want it by transitioning from a huge male one.  So even if I did, it would not change things that bother me and make me more dysphoric than now.  It would make the things about my body I don’t like stand out to me more.  

So how common is transitioning and non-binary?   What are your motivations for transitioning?

Then the other area I notice is how many people have binary presentations yet are non-binary.  I know there really are not any rules so I get that.  But how do you show that you’re non-binary?

For me I am showing my non-binary gender by doing these things:
- changing name to a gender neutral name
- clothing and accessories, jewelry, and cosmetics 
- not changing my body 

The name is obvious.  But my goal with clothing is to mix masculine and feminine.   My body is masculine so it does not help with anything feminine but limits me to some male clothing because of size limits.   I then use feminine clothing that I can find that fits and stuff to balance it out and bring me to the middle.   

I never understood the androgynous appearance goals because I thought masculine male was too limited and androgynous seems even more limited.   But I am really impressed by those of you that can make yourself look like both male and female at the same time or neither.   My body is too binary for that I think.

2019-06-23 09:46:51,c41w7s,3,9,"Last night I put together a costume for a fantasy themed event. I couldn't choose between the pants I had planned to wear and a skirt I tried on last minute because I thought the colours looked good. I asked my housemate who is also non binary and they said the skirt was more mystical, so I went with the skirt.

I thought I looked nice, but it was weird. I don't dress super masculine usually and most people wouldn't guess I'm dressing masc at all because I love bright colours and fun patterns but there are certain items of clothing I tend to avoid because I feel really confused in them.

So I think I look nice in skirts, sure, but I never wear them. I feel uncomfortable emotionally in them. Here are some fears I have - that hetero men will harass me on the street (esp a short skirt), that I won't be viewed as non binary by people (that know it exists lol) and that I'll get hit on more. I'm confused though because I don't know if my fear is of being seen as attractive (I am on the ace and aro spectrums + past trauma) or if it's a gender thing. It's probably both because confusion is fun! /s

It's also difficult to be seen as attractive specifically when wearing feminine clothes because I feel like maybe I'm hell ugly the rest of the time... 😔 I also have pretty bad body image issues that I do my best to ignore so I feel like that ties in too, because if people comment on me looking nice/pretty in feminine clothes that typically show more of my silhouette it reminds me of how weird i feel about my body

2019-06-23 19:15:39,c49yd7,0,1,"Hello. I'm a 18 year old female by birth and I've been struggling from severe dyshoria since and slightly before puberty hit. It has caused me bad depression and I've had a very unpleasant time with myself since. I've looked into my issue from various perspectives and with much thought I've come to think I'm nonbinary. 
The reason I'm seeking advice is, I've recently moved to Spain,  from my birth country, and I've little knowledge to how nonbinary is recognized here. I also have little support here and very few connections and my spanish isn't quite enough to express myself fully (yet!).
What I'd like to know is, how well is the nonbinary supported within the medical scene in Spain, Andalucia. What kind of options do I have when it comes to getting support from the medical system. 
I've applied for therapy but it's in roughly a month from now and I'm seeking to give myself peace of mind as these things tend to run around in my mind almost daily.

When I was 14 I confessed to my mom that I thought I was nonbinary. This confused and angered her. She has been nothing but accepting of any other identity while I was questioning my sexuality, but this upset her. When I explained the feelings I was having, she brushed them off. I wanted to be more androgynous and go by they/them pronouns. My name is Faith, and I started going by Faye, since it was more gender neutral. Everyone at school called me Faye, but my family refused. I spent so long trying to convince my mom to let me cut my hair. She finally let me, but unfortunately it was one of those awful “let me speak to your manager” haircuts. I just wanted a “boys” haircut. That was all.

So, I pushed down my feelings to appease her. I blamed it on my mental illnesses. I told her I was getting better. I believed it.

It’s just that, something doesn’t feel right. I don’t feel much of a connection to being female at all. I don’t like being called a girl or a woman. I don’t like using she/her as my pronouns. I hate having boobs most of all. Every time I see them I feel sick. I don’t take baths anymore because I just hate seeing them. I’d be fine if they were muscular pecs, but having sacks of fat just make me so uncomfortable.

I’ve bought myself a sports bra and instead of buying revealing, tight fitting shirts, I’ve been buying the next size up in T shirts pretty exclusively. I just looked in the mirror and realized I like how I look. I have a bit more body fat than I’d like and I want to build muscle, but other than that, I’m happy. I like my hair. It’s a feminine cut, but it suits me. My face looks like mine, which I haven’t felt in a while. My body felt right, not having breasts.

So, I’ve thought, am I trans? But no. Being called a boy is almost worse. I don’t want to be called he or him. I’m not a man or a boy. 

So what am I?

I don’t know. I just want to be me. I don’t want to be called male or female. I just want to be me. But I wish I felt female. I call myself a lesbian and I like being a lesbian. But how can I be a lesbian if I’m not female? That’s where it gets me. I want to continue being a lesbian. I don’t necessarily want to not be a woman, I just don’t really want to be referred to as such.

2019-06-28 19:32:04,c6ojc4,1,14,"So long story short (ish): back in 1996 there were just no words for gender identities that didn't fit the binary model. The best we had was ""Third Gender"". The only way, as what we now call DMAB, to get hormone replacement therapy was to recite 'the official narrative' and appear on paper to hit all the selection criteria as a Transsexual (we didn't even have the word ""Transgender"" yet!

So being that I wanted 'demasculinization', I toed the line, said the words they wanted to hear, and got my little pills that didn't do very much.

23 years later, my breast development is not much to write home about. Small enough that my insurance would actually cover implants in my case, but I've always been a bit on the fence.

What little breast development I've had, has always been a source of self-consciousness. Too much not to wear a bra (my nipples always seem to show under shirts), and too little to really help much in passing for female (and as an overweight person, bras in my cup and band size were always hard to find.. 46B? Not happening). And at the same time, prominent enough that I was always a little embarrassed - if they were bigger, would that feel worse?

Well last November, I got weight-loss surgery (yay!) and I've been dropping clothing sizes. The bras I've had for ages have been getting looser and looser, and I knew it was time to get new ones. My counselor at the bariatric center suggested I pick up a couple of sports bras, since they're stretchy, I could probably wear a snug one now, that would still fit as I lost some more weight down the line.

So I ordered the best reviewed and cheapest option on Amazon. About $8 each for 2. They're not quite as durably made as the ones I'd had for years, but if these last til I shrink out of them, then fine.

They're snug. Not tight, not painful or anything. But they're a bit like I suspect a light-duty binder might feel. And.. yeah, looking down, they smoosh my boobs in a bit flat.

A bit more than a bit, actually.

I.. I had no idea I would love this as much as I do. It's not so-so-so much that I'm flat-flat or anything.. but I feel.. better about myself. 

I had inklings in the past that binders seemed like an interesting idea to me.. but I just didn't expect this to ***feel*** so much more comfortable on an emotional level.

So I’m AFAB. My feeling/presentation can fluctuate from full female, to androgynous, to bigendered, to full male. I’ll dress, act, feel and respond within whichever of those four I’m in. Phases last days, to weeks, to months. The full male one includes pretty strong body dysphoria. As a teenager my brain starting telling me I had male equipment down there but I don’t. It felt like a phantom limb. And in my dreams I’d be completely a dude, only to wake up and find I didn’t have all my body parts and did have other parts...

Anyway, most of the time for the last few years I’ve felt bigendered/genderfluid where I can integrate what my brain says should be there with what is actually there. I also feel my monthly cycle sort of superimposes female feelings and experiences over/on top of my male brain. Then last year I had a baby and that whole experience was SO feminine and all female but now that has worn off and I’m back to my genderfluid/bigendered integration of brain (dude) and body (lady).

So here is what always confuses me: whenever I feel full female, I’ll wear a cute skirt and a cute top and my body language follows suit. It happens maybe once a year for a few days or weeks. But everyone responds SO positively. People go out of their way to say nice things about my looks. They counsel me to not be too ‘insecure to wear a skirt’, and basically start a whole campaign that I should do this more often. The social validation is overwhelming and confusing. Then when I go back to my normal NB ways.... I get nothing. I like my ‘regular’ style. I love it, really.

2019-06-30 01:58:26,c77my3,8,7,"Hey everyone,

So, I just need to talk about this to maybe help me feel better.

I've identified as Agender (or rather just having a lack of any label and just being ""me"" (any pronouns)) since I was 18 (currently 22) and I thought that was going to be it, I thought I found my path. A few days ago these thoughts just came into my head saying -

""Why don't you go back to just saying you're a female?""

""You're a fake, you did this because you think it's cool"" 

\- and stuff like that.

Now I did have these thoughts before through the years once or twice but they didn't stay like they're staying now. 

I've never experienced any dysphoria with my gender or body, I just kind of found out that I like to identify this way and it makes me comfortable. I noticed I never felt entirely female, like it's just something I'm called and respond to because I'm used to it. I know I've never felt male either and thinking about the gender binary to the point where it doesn't mean anything, I no longer cared enough to be part of it. This makes me feel like I chose this instead of it being something I had to find out to help me be a better truer me. It makes me feel like a total fraud and that's the last thing I want to be with myself and the people around me.

I gave myself an out loud talk in the mirror, saying different genders and trying to be as honest as possible. Everything else I said besides saying ""I'm just me"" made me feel like a tiny brick wall formed inside so, I'm like ""No, of course you still feel the same as before this is silly."" 

But, I just have a lot of self doubt and anxiety over every little thing so...

Does anyone else ever experience anything like this?

Does anyone have similar feelings about their gender/their gender discovery?

Am I valid to have these feelings and still identify as I am or should I question myself more?

I recently got home from a night out where I was at a table with 5 of my friends, 4 of whom are lesbian, gay, or bi. All of them cis. I am very closeted. I am an amab who identifies somewhere between female and neutral, but... I'm still their cis-het friend. And in 80% of our conversations about gender that gets brought up. Several iterations of that put me in a place where I'm not comfortable being incisive about my opinion and regrettably I let a lot of things I want to say just go in silence.

Today the conversation brought us to the trans subject. I'm just tired of getting snarky indirect criticism and eye-rolls when I talk, and then proceeding to hear my friend labelling transgender as a type of sexuality and everyone nodding obliviously. I heard the incredible news today that sexuality is fluid but gender is fixed, did you guys know that? And in the context it wasn't even clear if he actually thought that or if he had gotten the terms for sex, sexuality and gender all mixed up. None of which are fixed anyway!!! Then someone said some vaguery about performativity because it seems they've heard of Judith Butler in 2009. And then the great big cherry on top was hearing another friend at the table talking about his trans guy friend and calling him 'she' over and over again.

One of the seven seals in my closet is the ignorance even my super cool, progressive lgb friends have of transgender/non-binary gender. I seriously doubt they would even believe me if I told them I was nb.

I just wanted to get this off my chest, thank you for reading when I have no one irl to vent to about this (at least for now). I do want to remember though how quickly things are changing, and how previous generations have afforded us so much more hope that they will and will fast. 😊",NonBinary,Closeted enby feels sad and frustraded with their LGB friends...,1561895077.0,"{'created_utc': 1561869877, 'id': 'c796s8', 'num_comments': 10, 'score': 5, 'selftext': "" \n\nI recently got home from a night out where I was at a table with 5 of my friends, 4 of whom are lesbian, gay, or bi.

2019-06-30 05:51:47,c79qy8,7,4,"Admittedly, I used to be a very cynical, homophobic, and transphobic asshole. I grew up in a very Catholic conservative area, so I guess that sort of thing was ‘taught’ to me. I was that typical anti always preaching ‘being gay is whatever but don’t shove it down my throat’, ‘homophobia doesn’t even exist’, and ‘LGBT  believes in 76 genders!!1!’

Then I found out I was bi and realized a lot of my previous reasoning and thinking was just inconsiderate and generalizing. I was just uneducated on basically everything and was repeating what I’d heard others saying.

Lately I’ve been trying to educate myself more on these things so I don’t ever end up how I used to be. Lately I’ve been hearing a lot about non-binary, but I’ve never once met a person like that so I’ve come here to try and learn more. 

So here are my questions! Feel free to answer which ever you like or all of them, anything at all is extremely appreciated!!

-Is non-binary a third gender? 
-What exactly is non-binary and are there requirements to be nb? 
-How did you know you were non-binary? 
-How does someone else know if they are or aren’t non-binary?
-Can non-binary people be lesbians/gay?
-Is there a term for non-binary people who only are attracted to other non-binary people, or is there a term for non-binary people attracted to non-binary and women or men?
-Do non-binary people experience dysphoria? If so, is it anything like the dysphoria trans men and women experience?
-How long has non-binary been a thing/ been around?
-Do non-binary transition? If so, to what extent?

This week, I finally told the rest of my friends and changed my name on social media, after much experimenting with people I'm close to. 

  
I love my new name and using they/them pronouns. I feel like something has been out of joint inside me my whole life and it's finally back in place.

I'm also feeling intensely isolated, because work has me in a more rural community far away from my friends for the time being.
