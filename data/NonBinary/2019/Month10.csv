So, for all of my life I've been kind of a windbag, I've always liked reading Wikipedia for fun and learning things that  generally have no purpose in most people's everyday lives (etymology, anthropology, botany, etc). Being AMAB and also a ""gifted"" student as a child means nobody ever told me to stfu when I talked at them about random trivia. 

I've been out of the egg for two years now to myself and some close friends. At the current moment, most of my friends and co-workers are women or other enbies, and over the past two months or so I've been getting these day-ruining downward spirals of dysphoria after I catch myself being an obnoxious know-it-all man around them, blabbering about some obscure South American plant or some other shit they never asked to know about. To make matters worse none of my co-workers know I'm NB. I've read that many women feign interest whenever a guy is talking at them just because it's easier and safer for them, so I can't imagine how insufferable I must be.

I never intentionally want to mansplain at them, it kinda just happens because I genuinely want to share what I think is interesting, but I guess that's kinda the crux of mansplaining right?

Most of my dresses flatter me. My leggings and women's jeans also flatter me. My men's shirts are too short/small and my women's tops just don't work at all.

So off to Walmart I go. I grabbed a ton of women's shirts and none of them looked good. But I decided to head over to the men's section. A ton of unisex shirts and once I got the size right I bought 12 pairs. They also had some super cute sweaters in the same section. And then I bought 3 pairs of women's jeans 2 slim 1 bootcut. Also bought 2 men's hoodies (slim but longer).

So now I'm happy with my appearance. I am donating all of my men's and women's tops and most of my skirts and a few dresses I don't wear. I am also donating tons of formal men's clothes that don't fit.

I come from a homophobic and transphobic family, though they are trying to learn to be less homophobic it isn't doing so great... I am pansexual (female/feminine leaning) and bigender. I told my mom I like girls but she keeps on insisting it's ""just a phase"" though I'm practically adult now (turning 18 on the 3rd). I get adults can be confused on who they are still, but I know I'm not confused. They also insist my trans girlfriend is confused since she's around my age group. I love my family dearly but when I hear some of the phobic things they say...it gets to me.  


 I also went to a Christian private school for three years. All of the standards I had to meet are just insane, but it was worse for the guys I am sure. Here's a few things I remember: Guys couldn't have hair go past their ears, they had to wear a belt, and if they were friends with a girl, they had to be monitored. Girls had to be monitored if they had guy friends as well. There was a ""six inch rule"" that had to be followed as well, which meant no hugs, fist bumps, or high fives, even if it is same sex. Also that time I forgot to wear a skirt for the morning we were going to a convention i was forced to go to (principal was a nutjob who thought my actually diagnosed by a doctor anxiety was fake and was used to get out of doing things) so in my comfy khaki slacks that girls were allowed to wear during normal school days (thank god) I was forced to change into a skirt while we stopped at a Zaxby's in the restaurant's bathroom, and all of my classmates saw me enter and leave the bathrooms...I felt so ashamed... The whole five days were bad, but could have been worse. I got only five hours of sleep each day and we weren't allowed naps. I couldn't eat or else I'd anxiety gag and puke everywhere, so I was hungry and tired. I also had to suppress my sexuality in order to even stay there. So due to this, I still have bouts of internal homophobia and cringe at gay males specifically. I don't want to treat these people any different, I still love them as I'd love any stranger but I have to shove away my teachings. Same school almost expelled a ""Principal's Pet"" due to him being gay, he only stayed due to him almost graduating. I felt bad for him, even though he bullied me.

After starting T, I thought I would find a better fit in the ftm crowd (all super rad people!), but the fit still wasn't quite right. I love comparing notes and chatting with other nonbinary friends since they tend to have the greatest overlap with my personal identity. However, within this already small group, I've only ever felt 100% authentic and understood by the even smaller group of nonbinary people on T.

Another somewhat dysphoria-inducing thing I caught myself doing is not correcting people who use he/him pronouns for me.

I find myself needing to prove why I have a place in queer spaces, similar to how bi/pan friends in heterosexual-appearing relationships are treated. I knew conceptually that the changes caused by T would lead to a changed public perception, but dealing with this in practice has proved more difficult than I first thought.

Alright gamers (just a heads up, I don't speak like this normally, apologies if it's annoying, but it's what I do in these moments), so basically I've identified as enby for a while, but it hasn't really felt 100% right. Agender has been pretty close for me, so I've went with that for the past while. My one friend I'm out to knows me as agender, using they/them pronouns. 

But, here's the catch: sometimes I just get hit with waves of full-on boy moods, like I'm 100% male (I'm AFAB btw). But, sometimes I'm just kinda androgynous inside, and most of the time I relate to the general definition of agender. So, basically, I have fuck all clues as to whether I'm agender or male. And no, I don't feel lika a demiguy. It's either one or the other, not a mix of both. My closest explanation would be that I'm fluid between male and agender (but that sounds stupid because agender means you don't have a gender, even if that's literally how I feel).

But also, most of the time I don't 100% relate to the trans guy experiences, and my brain is all like ""Hmm that doesn't really feel like you either"". Am I just an abomination or something? Idk.

**in short, fem=short for feminine (a catch-all aesthetic descriptor), femme=largely lesbian specific identity (a unique identity with a complex relationship to femininity that i, as a non-lesbian, feel unqualified to talk now)**

as an example, i am transfeminine nonbinary, so i use the word fem to describe my presentation and relationship to gender. however i do not identify as a lesbian, so i do not use the word femme, and it would be inappropriate for me to do so.

now this isn't to say there can't be femme enbies, i know several nonbinary lesbians, some of which identify with the femme label, but folks, please try not to use femme when when you mean fem. we, of all communities, should understand the importance of labels to marginalized and largely erased people, and how it can hurt to have them weakened through misuse

if i recall correctly there is another use of femme that's related to the black gay culture and the ball scene, and if anyone knows more about that particular identity i'd love to hear the intricacies thereof, because that's unfortunately an aspect of lgbt+ history i'm pretty ill informed about. but odds are damn good for most of y'all that if you're not a lesbian, you mean fem, not femme

again, i fully admit that as a white non-lesbian i'm about as unqualified to educate about either femme identity as possible, but i've seen how much this misuse hurts our lesbian siblings, and nobody else seemed to be speaking up, so i figured better me than nobody

2019-10-04 14:23:54,dd81ni,12,8,"So just to start off, I'm not lgbtq+ myself and so as much as I try and expose myself and learn about how to talk in communities like this, I'm still learning so I really apologize ahead of time if I misspeak or phrase things in ways I think are ok but are actually not. Please correct me with as much force and context as is needed so I can learn properly (if you want, you don't owe me anything)! Just in case, since I know there is a possibility I might screw up I'll put everything from here on in a spoiler text.

&gt;!So I recently just started TA'ing in college. There is a person in my class who I noticed on the first day looked androgynous but I didn't need to use pronouns that day so I just moved on. This week I noticed a button on their backpack which I didn't recognize. I looked it up and it's the non-binary flag, which is why I've come here. Its been a couple weeks and I still haven't needed to use any pronouns for them, but I am growing concerned I may need to at some point and would really like to provide a safe environment for them by using the correct ones. I recognize that I am assuming a lot based off my little information, and the student has not come to me and said they are non-binary so all I have is my own personal observations and a button, which is definitely wrong to make an assumption off of. However I just don't know what the correct way of approaching this is and really want to create as positive and safe of an environment in class as possible. !&lt;

&gt;!So my question is two fold. Is it ok to (in a private setting) ask the student if they are non-binary and have preferred pronouns? And if yes, how should I do it? Should I mention that I saw the button and looked it up and am curious if they are non-binary and if so do they have preferred pronouns? Should I wait for them to come to me first? I noticed from looking through the archive that people have liked having a paper passed around on the first day of class asking for this information, which I'd love to try next semester but I don't have time in class anymore to do that now that the semester is in full swing. But, I guess asking more questions now, is there a source for where I can find a template for said paper, and possibly more answers to questions I may have in the future?!&lt;

&gt;!I don't have any immediate lgbtq+ friends that I can ask these questions to.

Unfortunately we (mainly she) are picky so we don't really like pibling, auncle, untie or anything else we could find so here's some creative stuff I came up with:

From dnd elven translator found on lingojam Aunt = Os'Nys &amp; Uncle = Os'Tan so:

Os, Oso, Nystan, or Tannys

From a draconic translator on twilightrealm.com Aunt = Yavsis &amp; Uncle = Iosta so:

Yio, Yiyi Yios, Yata, Sisio, Sisios, Yavios, Yavi, Iosis, Taya, or Stasis

Enbu (from enby)

Ranbu (from rainbow, kinda sounds like rainbow, but isn't actually rainbow)

Menu (like menoo), Meni, Versi, Verso, Versu, Maru, Marus, or Mari (all combinations of Venus and Mars, the male/female symbols)

Feso (a bit of a stretch, but the androgyny symbol also happens to symbolize iron sulfate, the formula of which is FeSO4)

Orchid, orchu (orku), orcho (orko), orcha (orka) (from the intersex symbol of orchid)

Neutro, Neuta or Neutra (from neutrois)

Demi or Demu (like demigender)

Mahu or mahi (from the Hawaiian term of mahu for nonbinary people)

Xi, Xixi, Xeni, or Xo (from xenogender)

Some of the draconian ones may be a tad difficult for a child to call you but I think everything else is a good option.

Hello guys! Just-became-17-year-old AFAB here. All my life (from the age of 10 to 16-ish) I've had no idea of gender and considered myself a closeted lesbian (I'm out to a select number of friends as a lesbian). However for quite a few months, somehow I feel that ""girl"" does not entirely fit me, neither does ""boy"". I do mostly feel girly a lot - even yesterday I wore a new dress which I loved, but today I felt uncomfortable when my sis suggested me to wear a skirt - it just felt wrong. Also, I feel like a girl when I am with my girl friends, but when I see boys laughing, fighting and playing pranks on each others, I feel like jumping into the fun with them - I literally think inside my head, ""Looks like the boy in me is bouta have some fun..."". I also feel like no gender, for example, I think, ""Fuck gender, I'm just a living, breathing, fucking (not literally) human"".In short, I always feel like a homogeneous mixture of boy, girl and agender, with girl feeling most prominent, then agender. 

Now coming to pronouns, first of all my mother tongue (Bengali) is completely gender neutral, which has an astounding YAS from me. However, I often have to converse in English, and nowadays I feel more comfortable thinking of myself in gender neutral terms (like person instead of girl, child instead of daughter, they instead of she). However, in my country (India), most people don't even understand L, G, B, or T people, let alone enby folks. I myself have to admit  that I understood how people can become trans only like six months ago. Two months ago, I tried telling two of my closest, most supportive friends that I felt like both boy and girl. Result? They thought that non-binary meant bisexual and thought I was changing my sexual orientation from lesbian to bi **facepalm**. Now if they don't understand, I'm sure no one will. Also, they were saying something to the effect that how vould I like only one gender if I say I myself am not one gender. I thought that if the concept of more than two genders confuses them, then the the fact sexual orientation is completely different from gender orientation will pass 100 km over their heads, so I said nothing.

So, here is the case. It turned out too long I'm afraid. I just want to know if there is a gender which fits me (girlflux is close, but still feels not quite right). Also, how can I educate my friends about gender? Coming out twice feels embarrassing to me.

I am straight (aka I like woman) and have been called man my whole life. I'm 16 and have never dated with anyone so a couple of my friends semi jokingly asked if I was gay or maybe even asexual (I'm not).

I've never felt that manly, and I never really cared. I used to be the quiet kid, then the weird kid and now... who the hell knows. I also never felt feminine in any way. I don't want to be called a she or even a they, but I started questioning some stuff recently because I noticed something. I want for us guys to act towards each other more openly like girls steriotiphically do, without immediately being seen as gay.

Essentially I feel like a man and sometimes I feel like I am non-binary with male pronouns. So being a demiguy seemed perfect for me. One problem though. 

It seems to me all demiguys who I listened that talked about this are much more on the nonbinary side of being a demiguy (or even the feminine side). I noticed that a lot of them say how they don't mind wearing dresses, or how they hang out more with woman than man and so on. And I know that's not me.

So my question is, is there a more masuline version of a demiguy? Cause from what I see demiguys are much more non-binary than male, while I am the other way around. I thought maybe I am just a male that's not that masculine, and there's nothing wrong with that, but then again there's that part of me that feels nonbinary. Calling myself male doesn't feel fully right. It feels like it doesn't tell the whole story.

2019-10-06 02:43:27,ddxi49,6,45,"My sister got married today. In BFE Idaho, at an air b&amp;b with literally zero privacy. 

Now, I came out to my mom about 10 years ago. Since then, she kind of pretends that it‚Äôs not a thing. She asked me to wear a T-shirt dress (mind you, the high today was 40), I declined, and [wore this instead. ](https://imgur.com/gallery/oDGKtF9) (please ignore laundry). I wore it with a binder, and purposely did not bring anything else. I knew this would start a fight. 

The rest is snippets of the day, I hope they make sense. 

At the wedding, my mom pretended she didn‚Äôt see what I was wearing, which was almost worse. I‚Äôm already feeling pretty alienated, as most everyone here is from the grooms side, or their friends, and they live about 14 hours from me. 

Afterwards, while we were making dinner, My mom  told me that she didn‚Äôt like my wedding outfit, it made her uncomfortable and was not flattering on me. And to please wear something different for the reception. 

I said I was sorry if I made her uncomfortable, but she told me to wear what made me comfortable. And that I would probably wear something similar to the reception. Unless she wants me to not go. 

My mom then cornered me in the bathroom *while I was on the toilet* so that she could cry at me. I promptly told her to go away, and we could talk later. Eventually she left. 

I would have rather waited until not this weekend, but She decided she wanted to have this conversation now. I essentially came out again. She called me her daughter and then asked me why I had to put labels on it. And argued that daughter is not a label. 

She also tried to guilt me with things like, ‚ÄúI loved you every day, and did so much for you‚Äù I said multiple times this isn‚Äôt what it‚Äôs about. Literally stole the rent line ‚Äútake me for what I am, or leave me‚Äù

She told me that she didn‚Äôt like the way I was treating her. I told her I didn‚Äôt like the way she was treating me, and that was the end of that.

Later on, she interrupted my phone call from my supportive chosen family, and we had this lovely exchange:

Mom: you are my child, and I love you and accept you for who you are

Me; then show it. Actions speak louder than words

Mom: how?

Me: like not saying shit like you did today

Mom: I said I was sorry (aka get over it)

I am lucky that I do not live with her, nor am supported by her in any way shape, or form. She also lives about 9 hours from me. I am so lucky to have a supportive husband, chosen family, and in laws. 

My brother did tell me he liked my outfit a lot and what my mom said to me was wrong ‚Äúcause that‚Äôs just who you are, and that‚Äôs okay‚Äù. So I‚Äôve got that going for me too.

The problem is if I continue on lupron after 2 years there could be significant effects to my bone density. 

Essentially, now my choices are testosterone or birth control. Neither of which are ideal for me. 
Birth control wouldn‚Äôt completely stop my cycles which would absolutely suck. It would be like going backwards and it also wouldn‚Äôt continue to halt top growth.
However, I‚Äôm worried testosterone would ruin my androgyny.

So, i'm a person who likes to snoop. Terrible trait, I know. I found my sibling's phone one time and then I found their reddit. I am EXTREMELY embarrassed to admit that I then looked at all their posts. 

That's when I found out their an enby (that's not a derogatory term right? That's like a fun nickname for NB?). I kind of already knew that because of an earlier convo we've had, which I won't detail because they might realize this is me writing this if they see this post..... (im on an alt account). I do totally accept them. I don't like saying that, because ""accepting them"" feels like I'm implying they made a mistake or their wrong or something. I guess better wording would be I feel like ""oh okay, good for you!"". 

And I now I feel bad, because A) I invaded their privacy and B) they didn't feel safe enough to tell me. I'm trying not to take it personally, or maybe I should? I'm trying to think if I've ever been unaccepting. I'd like to say I've never said anything wrong, but honestly when I was 8-11 I didn't totally understand how someone could be trans or Non Binary. Nowadays, I respect everyone and supply everyone. You're gay? Let's find you a boyfriend! You're fluid? Whoo! 

Anyways,  I know that snooping was stupid and yah. I get that I prob shouldn't tell them I know, in case they're not ready and stuff. Are there any ways I can show them I support everything? Show them I'm accepting and all that without making them feel attacked?

So yah.

I think they've kind of come out to my parents, because they got 2 binders, but also I've (in my stupid snooping) seen posts by them saying how our parents are only half-supporting and not fully understanding.

I'm posting this here, rather than r/fibromyalgia because I have specific question about binding and pain issues. 

How do you cope with binding when your pain levels are already sky-high, but you know that your dysphoria will be worse if you don't bind? At the moment, I just deal with it but I know my pain is worse because of it... Having a bath at the end of the day helps my aches, but doesn't help with the chest dysphoria. 

Side note | I'm *loathed*  to use the word ""sufferer"" in the title because it implies that I'm just sitting back letting this disease happen, when in reality I'm doing everything I can to live my life normally.

Or it did.

My hair has been thinning for years, with an ever more obvious balding patch on the crown, and it's become impossible for me to ignore this patch anymore. I can't see it in the mirror but I can feel it and I see it whenever I'm in a store or fast food place that has cameras on the queue, and it's giving me more and more dysphoria.

Lately I'm feeling like my only real option is to get out the clippers again and go down to the short-short cut for good, or shave my head completely. Which would probably be my top choice, except it's only in the last couple of years that I've come out as a demigirl and really started to present more fem, I'm totally loving being able to embrace my fem side, and super-short hair is going to make me look totally cis male.

I'm not about high-maintenance hairstyles and really can't get away with the kind of ""enby do"" I see a lot of peeps here rocking, not to mention I'm very reluctant to pay the money for a fresh do every few months after going 50 years with home haircuts.

A year ago, I started going to therapy because of some personal stuff and depression. My psychologist suggested that the reason I feel disconnected and demotivated is because I don't have a sense of identity and community.

(Pic of me, recents, chameleon yes)

Hi, my name is Kimberly. 
I present myself as Kay.
I never resonated with the name Kimberly, more annoyingly, my last name is also Kim.
Long ever since as I remember, 1st grade. 
I've always wanted to change it.
As I grew older, I had to suck up being called Kimberly, or got called Kim,  anyways.  Always been too feminine and never felt like ""me"".
I then realized I am nonbinary, maybe less than a year ago. 
Even more reasons to change my name.
I still am not fully comfortable. It can be challenging fitting into a new world where you are finally you but it can be intimidating and frightening.
I asked my mom what other name she would have named me. She said father was going to put me as Emily. Strangely, I wanted that name as a child. But now , I found a name I got used to a whole year, Kay. 
I was thinking of names with the letter 'K' to make it more familiar.

Kay is nice but would like a fuller name.

Kayden , I like , but my hispanic family wouldn't know how to say it I believe. 

I like Evan, but sounds like Ivan,  very masculine in Spanish √âe van.
Not like how like it to sound, with a flatter ƒì. Hm..

Ivory is quite pretty too. Ivy for short.
But not soo sure ifs fitting since I lean towards more masculine on my daily days and personality/energy wise, even if I  can look or like to dress very feminizing in some days.

I would like a smooth sounding and elegant  pronouncing name, so far all those 3 have that taste in my opinion. 

From the look of my face, which is more suitable and hits home in your opinion?

Feel free for other suggestions with the letter E or K that is neutral or a tab bit more masculine.
I find it a bit strange to range out of the letter ""K"" , how can I find ways to make it ease into me ? Maybe doesnt matter soo much of the feminine or masculine vibes, right? Should be more of what sits with me. But I am having a hard time deciding and finding it.

I'm a longtime lurker who has decided to give posting a go!  
My partner is an avid redditor, who suggested that I practice the vulnerability I preach in my music and try to build some community here.

I want to share my latest single, that just dropped today. The song is called ""Worry,"" and was a way for me to process the dysfunctional ""relationship"" I have with my anxiety and mental illness. My music is heavily influenced by artists like Emmylou Harris, Brandi Carlile, and Stevie Nicks. Growing up, music felt like one of the mediums through which I could most ""safely"" explore my gender, and artists like Stevie Nicks, who played with notions of femininity vs. masculinity.... hard vs. soft.... etc etc, helped me to feel less alone.

If any of this resonates with you, please feel free to head to [https://funding.plaiddogrecording.com/jessye-desilvas-debut-album](https://funding.plaiddogrecording.com/jessye-desilvas-debut-album) to check out the new single and to learn more about my upcoming recording project!

However I am very hesitant to apply a label to myself if it is inappropriate, as I feel it can cheapen the journey of so many who have fought so hard to be heard.   So I was hoping to share my thinking and hopefully get some input from you all!   I will try to be concise, so if you would like more information feel free to ask. üòä 

AFAB- growing up It was challenging for me to figure out where I fit. I determined at an early age that I was bisexual (though I have come to realize that I am, and have always been pansexual) but in the environment I grew up in there was no awareness/acceptance of genders outside of male and female.  
 some days I would  present more masculine, shopping in the mens section, hiding my hair under a toque/hat and binding my breasts, and other days present more feminine: skirts makeup etc.  
I have had my hair very short and very long, but my typical presentation was hair pulled up. No makeup, and typically a mash up of whatever made me feel awesome that day, but generally avoiding masculine/feminine extremes.  These are patterns that I have followed my entire life.  The exception would be formal dress, where I typically always present as feminine.. since honestly it‚Äôs just easier not to have to explain, and a bit more fun. 

It has never overly troubled me to be 
misgendered as male or female, though at this point in my life I am most comfortable with the pronoun ‚Äúthey‚Äù. 

I have always accepted that how people saw my gender was based on my physical appearance, but psychologically I never let that determine what I was able to do or what I was interested in. I remember being devastated and confused when I wasnt allowed to go hunting with my dad, and was made to go into girl guides.  Most of my careers have been in male dominated fields. Most of my friends were male.  I just didn‚Äôt feel like a ‚Äúgirl‚Äù. 

Then when I was pregnant and breastfeeding my children.  I was in awe and embraced it all fully.  I have never felt more powerful as a woman..

I'm a mtf crossdresser, and I've thought about being a trans woman, but it feels like a fantasy and I don't seem to have enough in common with other women to see myself as one.

But I've never felt particularly comfortable in masculine environments either.

I find most women confusing and most men brutish. I seem to get along better with women than other straight or non-feminine bisexual men I know; I'm able to make friends with women so long as I'm not lusting over them, whereas some men seem to view women as a different species.

There isn‚Äôt much research out there about the way transgender and nonbinary folks experience different body image issues (shocking, I know‚Ä¶). With this study, we‚Äôre hoping to change that. 

In this survey, you‚Äôll be asked to answer some multiple choice questions about your body image, as well as short-response questions regarding activities that impact your body image and what we in the psychology field can do to better understand and help trans and nonbinary people experiencing negative body image‚Äîand learn some tactics that promote positive body image too. 

Because this survey is about something very personal, I want to assure you that you will ***not*** be linked to your data at any time, and the survey will be completely anonymous. If anyone is interested, you can message me or my fellow researchers directly when the study is over, and we can share the results with you. 

And while helping further research is all well and good, there‚Äôs another incentive to participate; we‚Äôll be giving away one **$25 Amazon** gift card for every 25 participants (so 100 participants equals four cards). You‚Äôll need to provide your email to be entered in the drawing, but that will be in a separate survey form so that you remain anonymous. 

The survey itself will take between a half hour and an hour, depending on the depth of your answers and your typing speed. I would really appreciate It if you‚Äôd give it a shot, or send this post to a friend so they can know about it. 

Thank you all so much in advance, and I know that together we can help further our understanding of these issues and by doing so start to change the way people in our field think about our transgender and nonbinary siblings.

Are you a parent or prospective parent? Do you identify as non-binary, gender-nonconforming, genderqueer, and/or gender fluid? If so, you might be able to participate in a paid Harvard study examining the experiences of GNC parents. Confidentiality is guaranteed, and $20/hr compensation is provided for a casual interview.

This is a qualitative study that will examine the attitudes and experiences of non-binary, gender nonconforming, and genderqueer parents. The research will answer the question: how do GNC individuals navigate their parent identity, and how to they share the roles and responsibilities of parenting?

Sociologists have extensively studied parenting and gender inequality in home. Moreover, literature has positioned the differentiation of motherhood and fatherhood as a driver of the gender binary. However, this research has focused primarily on cisgender and heterosexual parents or cis gay/lesbian parents. Non-binary, gender nonconforming, and genderqueer individuals remain a population of parents that social science research has ignored. This work will fill this gap. By studying the attitudes and experiences of individuals who do not identify as strictly male or female, this work will contribute to a greater sociological understanding of gender, parenting, and the binary.

If you are interested in participating, please email Principal Investigator Fernanda Baron (they, them, theirs) at [fbaron@college.harvard.edu](mailto:fbaron@college.harvard.edu) or call at 832-967-7411.",NonBinary,Harvard GNC Study,1570740426.0,"{'created_utc': 1570715226, 'id': 'dfy8um', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 3, 'selftext': '&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Study Information:](https://i.redd.it/zjuok9n6xpr31.jpg)\n\nAre you a parent or prospective parent?

2019-10-10 14:15:53,dfymr0,9,28,"Yesterday I accidentally let something trans related show up in a picture I posted. Cue the freak out from family. I managed to lie my way out of it but I feel so depressed and awful. I can't shake this feeling. I am actually sick. 

I don't know what I am. I also hate that. I wish I was confident in my identity... And I wish more than anything that it wouldn't get me disowned. I thought about it in the shower last night and I think non-binary fits me the best. But now I am not sure since this happened. 

Being called a man or a woman is both really weird for me. I don't like either. I prefer they pronouns the most, but it still feels strange. I don't mind being called a boy or a girl, though. Boy is a bit more comfy but girl doesn't hurt that much. I do think I experience some form of dysphoria. I don't find having breasts nor a vagina very appealing. I'd much rather have a flat chest. I think I'd honestly prefer having a penis over my current parts, but that's not very possible for me. I love being considered very androgynous... It feels good. But I don't know if I have dysphoria due to being taken advantage of when I was just hitting puberty (this was done by two AFAB folks so I'm not sure if that's why I find vaginas repulsive or not). Maybe? I don't know guys. 

I'm afraid. I can't stop thinking about this. I feel almost like I'm suicidal. I don't want my family to hate me. And if I do feel this way, how do I find a relationship? I feel stupid. I wish I was just myself and it didn't matter... I don't know I'm just blabbering here I guess. Being non-binary is fine...I just don't know how to feel...

then arises the next problem: i've been identifying as a lesbian for the past 5 years. i know for certain im attracted to women, but nowadays i feel guilty and wrong for identifying as a wlw despite being so uncomfortable with anything feminine being attached to me. i suppose i should also add that i don't think of myself as male, at least not 100% percent.

*Processing img 6h3i47c1irr31...*

&amp;#x200B;

sick of social habits so many people share that truly hurt some of our sweetest kids to the point where they decide it is just not worth it to go on

&amp;#x200B;

In French language which is my native one we are providing a specific gender to every object in the room and every animal and every plant

&amp;#x200B;

yes

&amp;#x200B;

a giraf's pronouns whether male or female are she/her

&amp;#x200B;

but a baboon's pronouns whether male or female are he/him

&amp;#x200B;

the sun is masculine

&amp;#x200B;

but the moon and the stars are feminine

&amp;#x200B;

how crazy is this

&amp;#x200B;

where does it come from

&amp;#x200B;

it could be considered funny until the moment you know that almost one gender non conforming/transgender people out of two under the age of 25 has attempted suicide at least once

&amp;#x200B;

 then this urge to gender anyone at any time and in some languages to gender any single thing is not funny at all 

&amp;#x200B;

and it is not supposed to be considered as legitimate just because 'we have done it since the dawn of time'

&amp;#x200B;

WE DO NOT HAVE TO APOLOGIZE FOR TAKING A STEP BACK FROM WHAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE 

&amp;#x200B;

why do people need to specify the assumed gender of a person EVERY SINGLE TIME they are talking about them

&amp;#x200B;

how is it of any use in a family situation? in a business situation? in an education situation? how is it of any use at all?

&amp;#x200B;

do we specify the color of the eyes of a person any time we are talking about them ? their height? their weight? the type of their morphology?

&amp;#x200B;

so why specify gender, and especially when most people understand gender as the assumption of the type of genitals people hide in their pants? how healthy is that?

&amp;#x200B;

as many others here I guess

&amp;#x200B;

I know the answers to these last two questions

&amp;#x200B;

it is not a healthy habit since some people suffer from it and others are taking advantage of this habit to bully and hate on people who don't fit in and.or question this habit by their very existence

&amp;#x200B;

and there is not a legitimate reason for people to continue to do so once they know it is able to hurt people and especially their own kids

&amp;#x200B;

as transgender people we are the living proof it is not correct to assign a gender to someone at birth according to the type of their genitals

&amp;#x200B;

as nonbinary people we are the living proof it is not correct to assign a specific gender to someone at birth

&amp;#x200B;

we are the living proof it is not correct to assume someone's gender at all and we do not have to apologize for pointing at this nonsense

&amp;#x200B;

since the moment people -mostly kids- get hurt in the process

&amp;#x200B;

it is our responsability

&amp;#x200B;

my ultimate goal is to end gender assignment at birth and give back to any kid on this planet the human right to build their own identity according to how they feel instead of what is expected from them

&amp;#x200B;

there is obviously a tremendous way to go so I have been plotting for a while and came up with ideas

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to discuss these ideas with those of you who can relate to my journey in the next few weeks and see how it goesüôè

&amp;#x200B;

\*

&amp;#x200B;

for now I'll just let you know about an open letter I published on change. org discussing the matter above

&amp;#x200B;

it will do as a petition to gather people who also believe in the benefits that would result from the end of gender assignement for kids (and in everyday life)

&amp;#x200B;

I am only 2 signatures from my first goals which is to gather 20 people around that message

&amp;#x200B;

from there I aim to reach 100 signatures and beyond

&amp;#x200B;

if you have ever wished you wouldn't have been assigned a gender at birth or your gender being assumed by the entire society consider gather with like minded people and help me spread OUR word &gt;&gt;&gt; [http://chng.it/pmyfDrSW](http://chng.it/pmyfDrSW)

2019-10-11 04:44:03,dga3sw,6,19,"So here's my background for those of you that don't know. I'm 29 years old I'm a software engineer run my own business as well happy married for two years. I've been with my wife for a total of 5 years and a few months. I was very open with her the first week we started dating about my gender identity issues that I suffered against when I was younger and I still was dealing with them at that time.

She immediately supported me and everything and when we bought a house together she allowed me to dress anyway I felt even though I probably didn't look good because I was basically a guy in a dress. This year I've dabbled in actually going out dressed completely it's female including wig and makeup.

During a few of these occasions she did accompany me and she did support me what is a little bit tough on her because she had to be the strong one in these situations but it's completely understandable. 

After about a half a dozen times I took a look at what I really wanted to do going forward. Since I started to go out dressed I always told people I identify as nonbinary. because truthfully I was perfectly happy as a guy I just like to be feminine and present feminine at times.

fast forward to a few weeks ago I took the plunge and purged almost 75% of every article of clothing that I had. We donate it to the VA cuz my wife is for military I decide to build a single wardrobe with a combination of clothes that I felt pretty in but I could wear everyday.  I found a wardrobe that suits my body type but I'm very comfortable in and I can go out and get compliments from people about my outfit which makes me feel pretty.

that was only a few weeks ago and the amount of I don't care has grown to such a high level. I'm wearing jeggings leggings skinny jeans wedges women's boots and most of the shoes I wear have some sort of heel on them. I'm not walking out in pumps because frankly to me that just doesn't look right with the outfits that I have.

I always felt safe going out with my wife like this but the last couple weeks I've been venturing out myself and not even paying attention anybody. Truth be told very few people look or care, and those people that do are women and they're giving me a compliment which I absolutely enjoy. 

like the other day I was sitting at a bar having a margarita at a Mexican place in a girl will be younger me came over and asked me where I got my shoes from she loves them I told her Torrid.

The only two areas I still need ever, as my family cuz unfortunately that's going to be an uphill battle.

I just have been really questioning my gender identity lately, and I feel like I'm very unhappy identifying as a man.  But at the same time, I don't completely feel like a woman.  Generally, I've just been hating prevalent toxic masculinity that my friends exhibit, and even question my role as a 'man.'  Even with the realization that men are separable from those problematic traits, that still just isn't enough for me.

I don't really want to push any gender stereotypes, so I'll just state some physical and social discomfort I feel.  I *really* hate how deep my voice is, and it makes me anxious and self-loathing to hear it.  It's even deeper than it sounds to me, which is so much worse.  I don't know how to sound less brood-sounding in tone though, so I'm just really physically unhappy with that.  Also, this girl at my work calls me 'sir' all the time and I HATE IT.  I want to tell her that but of course I'll get ridiculed for it.  I've been wanting to wear more feminine clothes lately, but seeing the rising amount of trans harrassment in my environment makes me abstain from that, tragically :(.  I'm not saying that clothes and feeling sensitive are exclusive gender traits, but I feel very alien in the male identity, and engaging in things thought to be more quote-unquote ""feminine"" make me happy.

There may have been some slight deviations, but nothing more.  Over time I'm now beginning to realize this isn't me, and something isn't quite right.  One thing I will point out though is that I'm fine with my body, and actually kinda like it.  I've always considered it more feminine, since I have more defined hips and more curvy thighs.  And quite honestly, I don't hate my penis.  I am very satisfied with having it.  But it's everything else that I despise about my current false identity, really.

Am I experiencing dysphoria?  I don't know, but one thing for sure is that I no longer want people to see me as male, I hate it.  I wish I could express myself for who I really feel like, but I know I'm just gonna get beaten down and slandered in the conservative hell I live in.  Any advice?

So I live out in a very conservative rural area. There is a big uproar in a local school district because there is a FtM trans kid at the school that has requested to use the bathroom corresponding with their correct gender. The school was actually fairly accommodating, and allowed the student to use some of the single stall gender neutral bathrooms. Well, apparently word of this happening got out, and every ignorant hillbilly in the area put their two cents in. My FB news feed was suddenly full of people slinging their opinions about this, including screenshots from an appointed county official calling trans people freaks. This made me gradually more agitated as the day wore on. What set me off was the next day when a petition started being shared around to ""make local HS bathrooms gender specific again."" 

This is when I decided I was going to toss into this fight. I have some old pictures from when I was young. I am AFAB, but dressed VERY boyish when I was young, and was often mistaken for a boy. I know full well what it feels like to walk into the women's room and have women react strangely to my presence because of my gender presentation. I made a post about my experiences with gender nonconformity, and even pointed out that I live somewhere between masculine and feminine now and that it suits me fine. Fortunately, my husband read through the post and convinced me to take out some of the cursing, so I think it was received better than it might have been otherwise. I never blatantly identified myself with the words nonbinary or gender queer. I kinda just left the terminology at gender nonconforming so that I could relate to the trand kid they were all attacking. So far, all of the responses have been very positive. I did get a scare when someone asked if they could share the post. I was sure that if my post was shared outside of my friend group that I was going to be attacked by people who don't know me. Fortunately they never actually shared it, so that was a little bit of a relief.

2019-10-12 19:18:52,dgzk9s,1,0,"So I met my wife 5 years and 4 months ago we married just over two years ago. I came clean very early on (2-3 weeks in) about gender issues because I had multiple breakups due to that. She's always been really supportive but something's did take a little bit of time and that's what I want to talk about today.

When you don't live in lgbtq+ community, it can take time for people to adjust to requests and while lot of people want everything now you have to realize it might be easy on you but it's harder on other people. My wife let me dress however wanted a home I didn't really ask for different pronouns but she refer to me is my female name every now and then often times in third person as well. This should be usually in a casual sentence and never very serious.

But at the same time I often see somebody, out as transgender non-binary genderqueer excetera and they immediately demand the use of different names and pronouns. Why I think that people should work and understand the feelings of that person the person who's asking for it needs to understand it takes people time to mentally adjust and honestly just to remember sometimes my memory is very bad especially with names. 

It's also difficult for example if your 12 year old son comes out as transgender and wants to be called by the female version of his name but doesn't percentage female at all. That in itself I think is more difficult than if your kid is already wearing dresses and wants to be called by a different name. 

I've seen many examples especially on the MTF subreddit where somebody won't even begin presenting as the gender they prefer despite being on hormones for a year plus but then get upset because their family sometimes struggles or forgets to use the right name or pronouns. Like sometimes you got to help people out if you're upset you're being misgendered and you're wearing the close of the gender you were born but not the gender you identify with can you really blame society for that?

I've gone out complete dressed as a woman many times and maybe it's just I live in a Kinder area I've never gotten this gender despite mean not really passing out well. Be honest I rarely get double looks and when I do it's because I'm holding my wife's hand and people think we're lesbians. 

Anyway back to my wife...

She didn't really feel comfortable with me going out either dressed as a female or as I do now which is incorporate a bunch of different styles in my everyday wardrobe. But we agreed that I would go out to a drag show at an lgbt-friendly event with a friend of mine as a woman for the first time. 

When she saw me she realized that I do okay and we've gone out once or twice me completely dressed female with a wig and makeup. The first time is a little bit tough on her because she had to be the really strong one and normally I'm The Rock in the relationship.

For a long time I believed I was either genderqueer non-binary because I just enjoyed being feminine at times. So over the past few weeks I decided that I make a completely new wardrobe with a mix of some men's unisex and women's clothes that's going to fit my body type my style and comfortably. I normally have nail polish on my fingers and toes. 

Now we go out all the time I dress however I want she compliments me because she knows I like that and it's quite normal now. we're just a little bit careful because there's a few people in our lives that aren't aware of who I really am and we're not quite the point of letting them know.

She even asked if she could come to the drag show I was attending last night after work. She ended up not coming because the drag show wasn't good because most of the queens were at another big venue that night. So when she got off work we just met for a late dinner because my wife works at 11:30 no stress is my normal self acute unisex sweater Capri jeggings wedges my fingers and toes were done with bright blue with sparkles

So the point of all this is It's Not Easy especially when you have a significant other to deal with these kind of issues. I'm very lucky that my wife is very open-minded nice and kind person. It helps that we build a relationship solely on an emotional connection and not a on a sexual connection.  It can be very difficult for significant others to accept these kind of changes.

But one thing you do have to realize especially if you kept this hidden from the other person your life is they've fallen in love with a certain person in their fearful that person might not be who they really thought they were. You really can't fault the other person if they don't feel comfortable with these situations right away. I would hope that they would try to work it out and work through it and see if the relationship can continue on based off of the adjustments in a relationship.

In closing I would like to request anybody that is dealing with gender identity issues that if you're going to enter into a relationship I don't think it's fair if you don't disclose that you're dealing with these kind of issues. It's better to be friends with that person or not continue to spend a long time with them and then break it off after use invest a lot of time and effort into the relationship. 

It's okay if you don't know where you're heading or what the outcome is going to be when deal with gender identity issues whether you're transgender non-binary non-conforming or any of the other classifications. It took me until about 29 to really understand myself. But since my wife knew upfront about the issues I was dealing with, she helped me to truly understand what I wanted.

I need a new Reddit name, as I go by Steph now. But today something happened today that really gave me an idea. A nice girl reached out to me, newer to Pittsburgh and hadn't been out dressed before. So we meet at a nice lgbt bar and it gave her the platform to have fun. There was a drag show going on too! I was really happy that I helped someone with going out.

So I wanted to maybe start a monthly Meetup/group of people who want to have like minded friends, who they can be themselves and give advice. I figured we could maybe do some shopping and have dinner at different places. Help anyone with clothing advice and makeup regardless of going masculine or feminine.

But I've realized that many people don't have the ability to explore and find their true selves. I want to get a platform going to help people with this. Anyone in the greater Pittsburgh area is welcome (I live 20 miles east btw). I generally go out feminine but still presenting as male.

2019-10-13 07:26:25,dh7fjf,10,6,"I just recently put forward a question in the LGBT area of reddit asking what my gender was, and a little response I got pointed me to Non Binary, so I kind of wondered if I might get more clarification here, because I feel like I still don't have an answer.

I probably don't know all the terminology, but I will explain myself as assigned male at birth, and for the most part I am still pretty comfortable being a guy, I don't really feel any dysphoria in being a guy, like having a beard. But I have otherwise never been super masculine, like along with my long nails as a kid, I got a share of bullying put on me in being called 'gay'. Having thinking for a year or so, I have recognised certain things do make me feel kind of sick that wonder if it was people call such, and it is along the lines of hearing things like young boys told they have to be a real man and not cry, and be tough. I know that just sounds like fighting against toxic masculinity, and maybe it is, but there has felt like distanced element when I hear a ""boys will be boys"" thing, just felt wrong if applied to me. I don't know, maybe none of that means anything.

I know this will sound dumb, but I had what I might call an awakening a few years ago, with video games.  When I make a character, mostly called Dusky, it felt like a part of me represented in the game, and playing Dark Souls I was finding that I was not having a very easy time as a magic character, and doing research it looked like I should try a warrior character. But when I tried to create an as usual male character, something about it felt really wrong, like something about the idea of making me (Dusky) a masculine warrior was inauthentic, and not me. But suddenly I had the idea of what if I made the character female, played with the name a bit to be 'Duskei', and then have her be a tough warrior, and the feeling kind of totally disappeared, actually kind of feeling more right than I expected.

Most people have no deep reason for how they play a game, but the female Duskei persona kind of felt like an equal part to my male Dusky, and I found myself really comfortable with playing female characters. But it was not like something I made up, but kind of like something I had ignored and finally gave a name to. It has been since then that I have thought of the times in the years where I could wish that I could just turn into something like an alternate reality female version of myself, which I just thought that everyone might have those thoughts at times. Where as I had also felt a connection to feminism I was curious with things like anime where the line of gender could be crossed. And the closest I have come to putting into words what I feel like the movie Inside Out, where people are made up of a lot of different person like parts, I feel some are males, but others are female. Kind of like the main character of that movie has.

It isn't like I don't feel like I am male, but I realized that I might have been supressing parts of me that feel like female. I don't know if that is normal for cis, there is that concept like having your inner woman or something. I remember feeling really happy when I was just a kid when I learned that the particular spelling of my name could be both a male name and a female name, at least according to a website, and I am thinking if that should have been a sign or something. Like I really have not been a fan of my name spelt the common way or shortened in a way that is more masculine. I don't want to stand out, which I feel like would happen if I dressed ambiguously, my social anxiety probably would not take it, and I don't know what I want from having been looking into all of this.

Before I started looking into things like trans people, I am pretty sure that I thought that non binary people were trying to have things too convenient to them, in a way of looking special, like everyone would wish just switch gender. Something like Non Binary is too convenient of a title, especially if someone does not feel like a totally in the middle, because what I feel like is too ambiguous, and still kind of like a man to say I feel like the examples I saw.

Did use the search function, realized what I wanted to do was make a longass rant instead of asking anything productive so here goes nothing.

I was a textbook tomboy as a kid, and my parents were very liberal about it. Never wore skirts or dresses and played with a bunch of traditionally 'boy things', life was great. Then at the age of 12 I discovered anime. And the goodness of cosplay. My first cosplay was a male character, and my parents agreed 11/10 to it. You know, parent logic automatically assumes that cosplaying as a female character means having your butt hanging out in front of cameras and that's therefore a no-no. 

My second cosplay was also a dude, as with more than half of my cosplays to date. I love it. I always reasoned with myself that cishet girls like guys so cosplaying as guys you love is perfectly normal but apparently? That's not how other people think? 

Anyway. A few cosplays, binders and wigs later I figured that cosplaying has always been a way to satisfy both my escapist tendencies and love of aesthetics. We roleplayed as toddlers, I continued throughout middle school in the form of forums and straight out went to cosplay by the time I graduated because real life was nowhere near as fun. At the end of the day I guess I just liked being someone else for a while.

Highschool was also around the time I got into fashion in general. So yes, for the first time in her life, ya girl donned a frilly pink lolita dress and took a few selfies. By the end of the year I had a comprehensive wardrobe of cutesy outfits and an equal share of punk jackets complete with chains and studded collars. I grew to consider fashion as an extension of my cosplay habit. It was like cosplay, except the character was myself. Some days I would don a boyish look and other days a girlish one but the one constant was that even in a cute blouse and a pleated skirt I would flatten my chest because I was literally repulsed at myself. Never had an aching desire for a dick either but honestly, if I woke up as a dude I'd continue living my life as usual and the world would keep spinning. But even now since I moved from my Asian home where skin=sin to the center of Western clubbing culture, I still can't bring myself to wear anything that indicates a cleavage, or anything that is tight around the waist so as to show curves...

I don't know. At the end of the end of the day, I don't care much about pronouns - He, she, they, them; doesn't bother me and I'll still respond. These days I just scroll my Insta and work out what sort of Jrocker's aesthetic I'll borrow for the next day whilst keeping an arm's length away from all the hot/sexy archetypes that apparently guys like.

In April of this year, I contacted a local clinic to be put on a wait list for top surgery. That clinic's BMI limit is 35, which I am over, and so I began to **really** try, for the first time in my life, to lose the weight.

I've been doing some cardio, bodyweight exercises, and dumbbell exercises to focus on strengthening my chest because I know that having as much muscle in your chest makes recovery and surgical results better.

The clinic told me that I could contact them to get started and schedule a consultation appointment and everything when I'm 10 lbs away from the BMI limit, which for my height is 225. Only 13.6 lbs to go!!

2019-10-13 17:52:29,dhdw23,2,7,"Hi, so for the last couple of months I've been thinking about maybe not being cis, but I'm not sure?

I don't know if this is real or if I'm just making things up in my head. I had never questioned my gender before, I always felt okay identifying as a girl and when I was a kid I was almost stereotypically feminine: I loved dresses, the color pink, everything related to princesses, etc. And a lot of my self esteem is linked to performing femininity, even though I think butch women and androgynous people are super beautiful, I can feel like I'm looking good when I'm in non-feminine clothes. At the same time, I don't feel like being identified as a girl is very important to me? Like, if someone misgendered me I don't feel like it would bother me .  
I started questioning my gender specially when two people in my class came out as nb. The thing is, I'm super bisexual, but I didn't even think about my sexuality and went with the ""I'm straight"" default until a bi person came into my life. So I wonder if this could be something like that, I just never though much about things like gender and sexuality.  
Anyway, I've been thinking about how I'd feel if people called me pronouns other than ""she/her"" and sometimes I feel like it suits me, but I'm afraid this might be just a phase, or that I'm just influenced because I really enjoy reading about gender and queer theory.

I always tell them I'm both/or I ask what they think and why - I tell them girls can beards, boys can have boobs.\nAny tips on what else to say?

2019-10-13 23:50:34,dhijc9,3,7,"Hi guys,

So basically, I think i‚Äôm non binary. I‚Äôm AFAB and i‚Äôve always been very stereotypically masculine, however i don‚Äôt feel a connection to any gender hence why i think i am non binary. I started university a month ago, in the same city i‚Äôve always lived in, and i‚Äôve moved into student accomodation. my parents live a 20 minute drive away (inside the same city) and so i see them quite regularly. My parents, and my dad in particular, have always been very against the way i express myself, as i am very masculine, wear men‚Äôs clothing always, have a short haircut, and i‚Äôm always mistaken for a guy. And i love being this way, i feel so comfortable being like this. However, for 2 years constantly now, i‚Äôve wanted to shave my head. I am absolutely terrified of my dads reaction, I think he would go absolutely mad if i‚Äôm honest. I‚Äôm 18 and he still tries to pick fights with me over ‚Äútrying to be a boy‚Äù and has even told me to get changed out of the clothes i was wearing on a family outing a few weeks ago - no doubt because the outfit i was wearing was quite masculine. I don‚Äôt live at home atm but i might have to move back there during the summer of next year. I know shaving my head will make me so happy and lessen my dysphoria so so much, but i‚Äôm just so scared of his reaction. christmas is coming up soon and i want to spend it at home with my family, i really don‚Äôt want to damage my relationship with both my parents, i‚Äôm afraid my mum will be ashamed of me and my dad will just be plain angry. I know ultimately it‚Äôs my dads ignorance and people will say well he will have to learn to deal with it but he won‚Äôt change, i really don‚Äôt know what to do.

2019-10-14 01:15:54,dhjhj0,13,2,"Hi folks,

I'm in an utterly confusing place in life right now. This spring I had a very rapid awakening to my hitherto completely dormant identity as non binary (looking back thre were signs for a long time) and with that a creeping discomfort with my agab (female). This of course is highly confusing, especially as I'm 33 years old and thought stuff like this didn't hit later in life. Anyway.

While in the midst of this, and keeping it to myself apart from chatting online, I met a girl while away at work and fell hard for her. She is trans herself and I told her all of this and she has been nothing but amazingly supportive. The place where we both work is a pretty special environment and people live super close together, and your world grows very small. We dated for about three weeks before I left (we work 2 months on, 2 months off) and I went directly to go spend some time in the US with friends I hadn't seen in two years. As soon as we were apart I felt like some of that sense of comnection to her dissapated, but I attributed it to the change of environment and being absorbed in being back in a place I had missed a lot. She, however, had gotten exceedingly into me, and over all I dove into dating her head first without eally thinking and things got very serious very, very fast. She is also 11 years my junior, and this is her first real relationship.

While in the US, though, I met my ex whom I also hadn't seen for two years, when he broke up with me. We had dated for a year and I was super into him, and was devastated when he decided to leave. Things were friendly between us for the last year or so and we met mostly to talk things through. However, he ended up telling me how he has spent the past two years regretting breaking up with me and trying to get over me with no success. I, too, have spent the past two years being heartbroken and missing him like crazy. I told the girl what was going on because I didn't want to lie to her. The guy seems to be very sincere in his wishes, and he is a great guy, and broke up with me due to his demanding work which forced him to be away a lot and insecurity about marrying me (which we'd have to do for visas etc). He says he has grown tired of that work and wants a stability he didn't want back then. He wants to date (and marry) me and create a life with me. This is all I ever wanted and wished for, and had he just thought of this a month ago all would be amazing, but now I have this girl who is head over heels with me and I have no idea what to do with that. Meanwhile I'm spending time with this guy for the remaining week I'm here because I want to know what being with him again is like so taht I can make an informed decision. This makes me feel deceitful, but I honestly don't know what else to do, or how to handle this.

Sorry for that unloading which had little to do with the real question, but thanks for letting me vent: Do I tell this guy, my ex, about this whole gender crisis? I cut my long hair off to a boyish haircut which he has said several times that he likes. He is super accepting of trans folks and whatever people in general, sometimes I feel like he hs magically been excempt from all the bullshit conditioning society feeds us, homophobia, sexism, racism, toxic masculinity etc. But there is a difference in being accepting and 100% cool with all of this, and having someone you're seriously dating no longer being a cis woman, which they used to be. I'm still very closeted with a few exceptions and also honestly don't know if I have the energy to every come out to the greater masses and my dysphoria is very mild, mostly just annoying and uncomfortable, and I don't know if I'll ever actually go through with the changes I want to make (low dose T as I really want a small beard and a small dick) as that would mean I would have to deal with coming out, which frankly is an equally terrifying and exhausting thought. Can I just not come out to him? Or is that a terrible idea? It's only been 4 months so maybe it won't last? I am so fucking lost in what would have been a confusing and shitty situation enough with only one or two of these issues, but clumped together just make me want to crawl under a rock and die (not really, but you know).

2019-10-14 01:48:42,dhjuvm,3,6,"Hi guys, so I'm afab but for the past few months I've been identifying as nonbinary (most likely gender fluid, but I'm not absolutely certain yet). I don't really experience gender dysphoria when I present female, but when I do bind and tie my hair back (I‚Äôm not ready to cut it yet) I definitely feel sooo much more comfortable with myself, like I just gained something I never knew I was missing. Also, being misgendered isn't terrible, but there are some days when I really wish people would use they/them pronouns.

I know my friends will support me, but I've known most of them for my entire life and I just feel uncomfortable asking them to think of me with a new name and they/them pronouns. I'm out to one friend who's also nonbinary, but they live in a different state so they can't really help me come out to everyone over here. I attempted to come out to the professor I'm closest to on Friday but I freaked out halfway through and told him to forget about it. He was really understanding about it though and said to let him know in the future if I would like him to use different pronouns. 

I'm also scared that once I come out, word will get around to my parents, and they're rather transphobic. Honestly that's why I haven't cut my hair yet; I'm still financially dependent on them and I don't want to go home for the holidays and get disowned.

It definitely wasn't this hard when I came out as bi.

I'm a nonbinary, gender fluid AMAB person. I prefer to dress androgynously, not overtly male or female. I'd like to wear a couple of subtle lingerie pieces in public while I'm out socialising and I have a couple of questions that I'm hoping to draw on this sub's experience for answers.

1. I want to wear a black corset under a shirt. When you google 'male corsets' you always seem to get either weightlifting aids or steam punk pieces. I'm looking for a black corset, possibly with suspenders, that finishes higher than a waspie. I'd like to avoid corsets with cups that boost cleavage - just a straight hem that finishes around the nipples. Any recommendations? Any good brands to check out? 

2. If I start feeling overtly male while I'm wearing lingerie, it can have an unwanted effect! If I wear them while I feel more androgynous/female, it's just underwear. I don't have any control over this so I need something that I can wear with hosiery (preferably something pouch, thong or g-string based) that keeps erections under control.

2019-10-14 22:34:37,dhycjx,6,6,"I'm a 20 year old and for my whole life I've been used to female pronouns but since I learned non binary I've had a small part of my brain that's constantly been wondering if that's what I could be.

As a kid I was what you'd call a tomboy, preferred running around and playing football with the boys, constantly wore trousers and liked climbing trees and generally hated anything pink/girly. 

As I got older that changed a bit but that could just have been due to the pressures of society. 

At the moment I've grown to quite like makeup and some aspects of feminine clothes but I still hate pink and a recurring thought I've had since I was little has always been that I'd like to experience being male, even if it was just for an hour. 

The biggest concern I have though is how people in my everyday life will react if I am indeed non binary. 

The one person I know who will be the most accepting is my boyfriend of 3 and a half years. He was very supportive when I was figuring out what sexuality I identify as and has been learning more about the LGBTQ community since we started dating. 

The thing is I'm still not 100% sure if he would be OK with me being non binary considering he is a very straight guy. That could just be me overthinking but I can't help it. 

Then there's my family who I have no idea how they'd react. My brother is the most likely to be accepting but my parents are very 50/50. 

There's also my best friend of nearly 14 years who is part of the LGBTQ herself but is slightly acephobic and idk what her thoughts on me being non binary would be.

Today I went to Target with some of my buddies (who don't know I'm NB) and stumbled upon some neon green high waisted shorts in the clearance section.

Fast forward to forty minutes ago. I got home, and while changing into my lounging clothes, I decided to quickly try them on again aan try to figure out what they looked good with or something. After about five minutes of somewhat despondently trying to coordinate them and feeling that familiar sense of _‚ÄúI can't recognize myself‚Äù_ but trying to motor through it partially as self-sabotage, I started to feel like my thoughts were too loud ‚Äî a hammering mix of ‚ÄúYou're overreacting‚Äù and ‚ÄúYou're living a fucking lie you can never get away from‚Äù that made me immediately compelled to sit in my closet with the lights off, which I'd never genuinely wanted to do before. I became somewhat disoriented and tried to calm myself by breathing deeply but it wasn't helping at all. 

I pulled off the shorts quickly so I could put on some sweatpants, and that took me several moments as I had to keep pausing to try to catch my bearings.

Hello all, I‚Äôm still getting the hang of using reddit and posting so please bare with me :)

Anyways lately I‚Äôve been wondering if I might want to transition. To give you a little background I‚Äôm 20 yrs old and AFAB and currently use she/her pronouns. I have been identifying as a cis gay(identifying as lesbian makes me super uncomfortable)person who had been dressing masculine since about 14yrs old. I‚Äôve also been getting my haircut in a masculine way since then as well. But I‚Äôve been questioning my gender identity for a couple years now. But I think inside I do want to start HRT and eventually get top surgery. I have a lot of bottom dysphoria and a little too dysphoria(I have a very small chest so it‚Äôs easy for me to just throw a sports bra on and a baggier shirt and push the idea out that I even have breasts). 

All that being said I‚Äôm scared that I might change my mind. Some days I feel like I could go on living my life as a female and be okay and some days I don‚Äôt even wanna get out of bed because of how dysphoric I‚Äôm feeling and how badly I just want to be seen as more masculine. 
I‚Äôm also very nervous of what my family will think, especially my grandparents and non immediate family. When I came out as gay my dad and step mom(who are super religious) would constantly take me to church have someone pray over me to basically pray the gay away. My non immediate family isn‚Äôt super religious but still I don‚Äôt know how informed they are. My partner(21yr old cis female) is very supportive in whatever I decide to do so I know I‚Äôll still have someone but I don‚Äôt want to lose my family.

2019-10-15 18:11:33,dibv0a,4,6,"New to all of this stuff, and I see all of the stuff that puts sexuality and gender as separate things, but I am kind of wondering if they can be linked. I am AMAB, and I am kind of leaning towards maybe having multiple genders inside of me, and for most of my life I have been supressing my female gender(s?), which occasionally leaked through.

I otherwise have mostly been attracted to women, women in general okay, but really boyish looking women especially got my attention, like I mostly did not understand why other guys were more into the larger breasts, but when they were small to even flat, with a boyish haircut, I could feel stronger.

I did not feel gay or bisexual.

I think that I was coming more to recognize parts of my other genders, I think that I felt one part a draw for lesbian narratives. I understand lesbian/yuri is something totally enjoyed by cis men, but I think it was a feeling of being one of them. The other part, more recently, I think I have started to feel the attraction towards more masculine elements as I am becoming more accepting of my female side, like I think maybe proportionally.

All I got was love, messages of love , people coming out of the woodwork that I hadn't seen or heard from in years just sending me support.

2019-10-16 00:11:36,dih0kv,6,4,"Hey friends

I was wondering if anyone here had any advice

Over the past few months I've tried to start binding, with very little success, but nothing was as bad as my experience today.

For context, my chest is VERY large, especially in relation to the rest of my body. My bra size is 32G, with my chest 13 inches larger in circumference than my waist. Having a chest this large has ALWAYS been a huge cause of anxiety throughout my life, and as I've been trying really hard to present androgynous lately, it's been super difficult to get rid of it.

I have tried binders from gc2b and underworks. The gc2b binder barely compresses my chest at all. It's mildly uncomfortable, and I still look like I have giant boobs.

I recently ordered a compression tank top and sports bra from underworks. The tank top isn't uncomfortable at all, but again, it doesn't flatten me that much. The sports bra on the other hand completely flattens my chest; however, it's one of the most painful experiences I've had.

I put it on today. It's so tight that in order to get it over my chest, I had to step into it, stretch it to its limit all the way over my hips (which was NOT easy) and then finally get it on my  shoulders.

Once I had it on, I could barely breathe. (I have scoliosis so lung compression is always a worry of mine.) My spouse could hear my breathing from the other room. After about 5 minutes, I started to get lightheaded and dizzy, so I got it off as fast as I could (which wasn't fast, since again i had to take it back to down my huge hips... I really hate having this hyper-feminine body...)

For the rest of the evening, I've been feeling nauseous and lightheaded, even though it's been off for the past hour.

So, right now I'm feeling a mix of awful feelings - physically, short of breath and nauseous, and emotionally, so discouraged that I'm just stuck having a body like this that I can't do anything to hide.

If you've read this far, thanks so much for reading through this. Any advice would be appreciated.

2019-10-16 00:42:36,dihege,3,5,"I've been questioning my gender periodically over the past year.  It usually starts with feeling euphoric about the possibility of becoming a woman followed by panic about all the transphobia I'd have to deal with.  I also usually start thinking I'm not trans and that these thoughts are the result of some kind of pathetic incelish neurosis.  I worry that I just want to be trans so I can get off the hook for my male privilege or that I'm just trying justify being a weak passive guy with no self confidence.  I also worry that I just admire the queer community and want to be part of it for community and solidarity that is one of the few benefits of being part of a marginalized group or that I have a need to justify my self pity and persecution complex.  

Questioning my gender was the trigger for a suicide attempt last January although a lot of other things went into it.  My life's been pretty hard.  I'm autistic though I'm lucky enough to be able mostly pass as neurotypical.  All the same I've never had a romantic relationship and it's really difficult for me to hold jobs and get through school.  I've had three one night stands that simultaneously made me feel like i had sexually assaulted myself and terrified that I had inadvertently crossed consensual lines due to an inability to read social cues, toxic masculinity making it feel like losing my virginity was a matter of life or death, and an ignorance of affirmative consent at the time.  Almost everyone I talked to including some of the women I had sex with told me that it was clearly just bad sex but I can't shake the guilt.  When I remember those experience's it still feels almost physically painful sometimes.  I've semi-intentionally avoided sex since then.  I guess I worry that I'm sub-consciously convincing myself that I'm trans to explain everything that's wrong with my life.  

I definitely don't like being a dude.  I hate the fact that women are wary of men by default and that they will never fully trust me.  I like being friends with women more than men but the fact that I'm attracted to some of to them might be perceived as creepy or threatening makes it really hard to talk to them.   The way a lot of men seem to think feels pretty alien to me but I'm not sure if that's just because I have a good understanding of feminism and most of them don't.  I really want to be friends with women in the way they are friends with each other.  I've also heard things about how estrogen changes your sexuality that appeal to me.  My testosterone based sexuality disgusts me a lot of the time.

I'm not sure I want to be a woman completely either.  I think having breasts would bother me.  Overall I'm mostly ok with my body and presentation.  I'd like longer hair and wearing women's clothes and makeup are something i'd like to try.  I mostly just want to be socially perceived as a woman.  This would be difficult because if i were hypothetically born with a female body I'd probably be pretty masculine and I worry that being a butch lesbian with a male body would just make me a man as far as most people are concerned.  I also don't really have any stereotypically feminine interests.  I listen to  a lot of loud aggressive music and I kind of have edgy teenage boy sensibilities.  I'm aware that there are plenty of women like this though.

It'd be nice to get some honest feedback about all this.

I experience pretty severe cramping with the first day or two of my period, which leads to feeling nauseous &amp; leaving work, never mind feeling betrayed by my body. After months of having to take at least a day off of work (including today, in my busy season) and dealing with off-cycle bleeding, I finally made a doctor's appointment to address things. After the exam, she asked about how I felt about hormonal birth control, which I am not very comfortable with. I expressed my concerns of how hormonal treatment might impact my gender identity and she didn't flinch for a second. She asked my pronouns and made sure that she input them into the system herself. It was reassuring, especially as I had never met with her before and I'm only very subtly out to a handful of people. We discussed options, ordered additional tests, and made a follow-up appointment for a non-estrogen birth control to hopefully ease cramping and potentially eliminate my period all together. Even the idea of being period-free is gender-euphoric for me!

And my answer to myself was no. I've felt this way all my life. It's okay to feel fluid. It's okay and normal to have a less dysphoric day. Buttttt...I still felt like I was questioning myself. So I brought it up to my therapist. (My therapist is enby genderfluid and queer THANK THE GAY GODS!)

2019-10-18 23:49:55,djvzd9,2,7," If any of these sounds wrong or offensive please warn me I'm open to learning and improving myself as a human being and I have no ill intentions, I love you all.
I'm a 22yo student with autism and anxiety problems. I do not feel like any gender at all, I don't even know what does it mean to feel gender. I feel like I'm just human. I've been this way as long as I can  remember. I have a unisex name and our language doesn't have gendered pronouns so I don't have any problems on these things. I have a couple of problems and questions I'd like to talk about with you. 


First of all I have a woman's body, but I'm taller than average women in my country and I don't have much feminine facial features. No matter what I look like people always stare, question my gender etc. First moments of me questioning my gender I was trying to present feminine to avoid confusion and unwanted attention (y'know anxiety and stuff) but people confused me for men dressed as women to do sex work. (They don't do it because they are not cis but only for sex work and they are not respected [I don't mind what people do with their lives as long as they are not hurting anybody]) and getting laughs on the street is hurtful. Nonbinary is not a known concept here so I will struggle no matter what I do but I still feel incredibly uncomfortable and anxious when people stare too much to gender me somehow. Also people always assume if you dont look female you must be someone who wants to be a man or extremely masculine etc.  Anything gender specific makes me very uncomfortable. How can I get over this anxiety and not care about what people do and say? 


I'm very very uncomfortable with my body's feminine features, I have small boobs but I still feel uncomfortable I've never tried binding does that help? Is there anybody here who got top surgery and how are you feeling about it? I also don't want to get periods and I don't wanna be fertile, they also feel gender related to me and makes me uncomfortable. Is there a way for me to get rid of these? Does medicine support something like this? Or would they just go; oh you have autism and we won't take you seriously? 


I always wonder what taking testosterone helps you achieve as an afab Nonbinary? 



What kind of media can I surround myself with to get rid of the idea of gender specific beauty concept? I mean, I still feel bad about my looks for not having a feminine beauty. This needs to change for me. 




I identity as bisexual, I used to identity as pansexual because I thought bisexuality didnt include other genders besides male and female but I'm surrounded by total idiots who think pansexuality involves animals. So I'm nb and my sexual attraction is not defined by the other party's gender. Does it still make sense for me to identity as bisexual? Also if I were to date a straight cis man would that man be not actually straight for being attracted to me? I really don't know how does these things work.

2019-10-19 11:50:06,dk2q8d,6,20,"AFAB person here.

Always hated my period. Painful, messy, embarrassing, uncomfortable. Have known since I learned how babies are born that I didn't want to give birth (literally have had night terrors about pregnancy). Of course, being a young, healthy AFAB, all of my past OB/GYNs have refused to even consider any form of sterilization surgery for me because ""You'll change your mind"". The most *infuriating* thing that *everyone* says to me simply because I was born with a working uterus.

Cut to yesterday, day 1 of shark week. I'm hobbling around at work, instant heating pads clutched to my lower back and beneath my belly, whimpering in pain every time I had to move from sitting to standing or vice-versa. I jokingly mentioned to the OB/GYN office that shares a space with my internal med office that their doc should just pull me into a procedure room real quick and just yank my uterus out through my vagina.

""Well, you wouldn't have to have a complete hysterectomy to stop having periods, you know,"" the nurse said casually. She took a bite of her sandwich before continuing.""Could just do an ablation and tubal. Doctor $name does those pretty frequently.""

""... Sorry, what?""

Apparently there's a very brief, minimally invasive pair of outpatient procedures that they are happy to do for me. Tubal litigation, the one most are familiar with, would be getting my fallopian tubes cut (they can also be tied, stapled, or burned) and my ovaries removed. Endometrial ablasion is even cooler (well, technically hotter) -- they would go in and basically turn my uterine lining into one gigantic burn scar. My reply to her was ""that sounds metal as fuck, let's do it!""

As I walked away from the conversation with a bounce in my step and a plan in my mind, I realized there were three things that felt gender affirming about the procedure: sterilization, loss of menstruation, and the fact that I would spend the rest of my life with *sick af burn scars all up inside me*.

* I get mad and jealous when I see photos of men with soft features, from 90s heartthrobs like Johnny Depp and Leonardo DiCaprio to today's top K-pop stars like BTS, Monsta X, and NCT 127.
* When I see myself in the mirror, I see an androgynous man. Like, an ugly surfer dude. I hate it.
* When I do drag like a straight man, I see a cute little baby girl. I hate it.
* I like makeup and femininity, which makes me wish I was a drag queen and not a drag king.
* I'm a lesbian, yet I look at pretty boys (see above) and think ""Do I want to fuck him, or be him?""
* All the celebrities I see myself in are men (straight and gay). This may be compulsive heterosexuality, but it's gotten to the point I can't perform songs by women because I can't connect.
* I always felt like labeling myself gender non-conforming or non-binary \~spiritually\~, because I act like a femme man. However, my femininity is always read as a cis woman, and this frustrates me.

Not sure how many people know about ONTD, but it's a livejournal community about celebrity gossip &amp; current events that is pretty much the only thing still kicking on lj anymore.

Anyway I've been a member there for over a decade now and while it used to be a real nightmare place (wasn't everything on the internet in 2008?) over the last 10, especially 5-ish years people there have gotten a lot better about being socially aware and conscious and open-minded. 

Except when it comes to gender.

Just tonight there was a post about how Always, the menstrual product company, has finally removed the ‚ôÄ symbol from it's packaging. Many trans and NB people complained so they did the right thing and got rid of it. I'm AFAB (NB/agender now, any pronouns) and use Always products and have been, shall we say, less than fond... of that packaging for years. I mostly just rolled my eyes but continued using it because, well, I don't like most of the alternatives. 

Even though I know from experience ONTD isn't good at gender discussions I really thought this time might be an exception and that people would be glad to see a big company finally do something to not be transphobic. 

*Sigh*

All the comments are so fucking ignorant I want to grab these people and shake them.

""That symbol means biologically female so even if someone is non binary or trans if they get a period they're biologically female so they shouldn't be upset.""

""Why is it always things for women getting removed?? Why does no one ever complain about all that stupid stuff being labelled 'For Men'?"" 

""Wait why would transwomen complain about this I thought they didn't have periods"" (yes there were REALLY m u l t i p l e people in there saying this. I can. not.)

And so on and so forth. There was literally ONE other person in the comments who was like ""hey a lot of y'all in here sound pretty transphobic"" but everyone else was just sitting there talking about how removing the venus symbol is actually anti-feminist and ""such a 2019 problem"" and ""don't these people have real problems?"" 

It's just so discouraging that a community that has come so far and (these days) gets so much right is still so utterly and completely backwards on this. I stopped reading and closed the page but the bad mood has already set in and now I just want to scream and cry out of frustration.

2019-10-21 18:38:30,dl4u39,6,10,"I (AFAB, mostly cis?) don‚Äôt like having large boobs (32 G), but don‚Äôt have body issues in general (like my large hips/thighs or being a little chubby). Rather than them simply being annoying (as any woman with large boobs can attest), they feel alien to me. 

I‚Äôm on the tomboy/androgynous side, short hair, wear a combination of men‚Äôs/women‚Äôs clothing, don‚Äôt feel womanly, don‚Äôt want to be a mom. Everything about my physique says I‚Äôm equipped for childbearing, but that‚Äôs not something I aspire to. I hate it when people call me ‚Äúmiss‚Äù or ‚Äúma‚Äôam‚Äù or ‚Äúsister‚Äù. But I don‚Äôt know if it would feel right to be called ‚Äúthey/them‚Äù either. It‚Äôs also confusing because I don‚Äôt have any bottom dysphoria.

It doesn‚Äôt turn me on at all when my husband touches my boobs. It‚Äôs completely foreign to me hearing about women who orgasm from playing with their nipples. It feels nice, but it‚Äôs more akin to touching my shoulder or arm, or like me touching my husband‚Äôs chest.

I‚Äôm intensely jealous of women/NB people with flat chests. Female roommates in the past have admired my boobs and joked that they wish they could trade. I honestly wish I could... It‚Äôs to the point that I got a binder recently, and will start experimenting with that if it‚Äôs not too painful. But I fear it will be because my boobs are pretty firm and will only smash down so much. I‚Äôve thought about getting a breast reduction for years, but it‚Äôs a lot of money, and my job is physically active so I‚Äôd be out of work for weeks if I were to do that. I still don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd want a drastic reduction or full-on top surgery.

To make things even more confusing, I come from a background of purity culture with a high emphasis on modesty. As it applied to me, modesty mainly meant covering up my cleavage. As a teenager, cleavage was seen as a terrible, scary, slutty thing, and the girls around me were constantly scrutinizing each other, telling each other to pull up their shirts. I was taught that I was responsible for men/boys‚Äô dirty thoughts. I was the guardian of my ‚Äúvirtue‚Äù.

Everything about my physique says I‚Äôm equipped for childbearing, but that‚Äôs not something I aspire to. I hate it when people call me ‚Äúmiss‚Äù or ‚Äúma‚Äôam‚Äù or ‚Äúsister‚Äù.

As it applied to me, modesty mainly meant covering up my cleavage. As a teenager, cleavage was seen as a terrible, scary, slutty thing, and the girls around me were constantly scrutinizing each other, telling each other to pull up their shirts.

I'm AMAB, recently coming to terms with being NB for about one and a half year. Before that I identified as gay with a sidenote of female flair moreoften (liking dresses, highheels and so on). Pretty much since the later half of my first (and only) relationship about 11 years ago I knew I was ARO (even when the exact description of being ARO wasn't there for me to grasp until I realized I'm NB and did some research on it) because there weren't any romantic feelings there. Most time when HE (who shall not be named - long story short, he cheated on me in our flat while I slept in the bedroom) said ""I love you"" I told him: ""Same"", ""Dito"" or other words without a romantic feeling behind. So after we ended the relationship and I moved back to my old hometown to get away from all the memories, I never had any relationship. For the last fricking 11 years.... I had ONS sometimes but even that isn't possible any longer. I have a very specific typ of men I like but even if I find someone matching the criteria I can't find the right words or actions to declare my interest. Explaining who I am, a NB, ARO person is always difficult. Most men don't understand that I don't identify with any gender and some are even hostile in their response. The few, who say they ""understand and respect"" are sometimes really creepy in their responses or baiting me with acceptance.

And here is my  main problem: since all these negative experiences with dating I often times get panic attacs when meeting a guy, sometimes so bad that I have to cancel the date or in some instances had to ghost (I know it's horrible but I coulnd't stop the panic attack just enough to tell them no) them. Most of the time it's fairly easy to get out of this but sometimes I start thinking things like: they gonna come over and kill you, they try to force you doing things you don't like, they come over, look at you and turn around laughing....

anyways, after coming out to my friends, mom, and sister, i ended up making a public fb post to come out to everyone else.

i kind of froze when he said it, and i could see my mom freeze up behind him as well. in the same second, he corrected himself, saying, ‚Äúwait, you‚Äôre not a girl.‚Äù

it was so easy to laugh it off, because of course i had to remind him that regardless of my gender, it was a stupid and sexist thing to say. it felt like a typical conversation between us (he slips up with stuff like that a lot lmao) and idk that part felt so normal that it was really comforting.

2019-10-22 23:32:50,dlqkkm,2,6,"Hey guys, so I‚Äôm trying to decide between two different underworks binder styles and would love to hear some thoughts and personal experiences. This will be my first binder, I ordered the cotton-lined 975 in a medium a week or two ago and it was too loose so I posted it back and have just been given the code to order another.

I‚Äôve been wearing just those nike sports bra/crops for a while now but I think I‚Äôm usually a 10DD or 12D size wise (32DD or 34D in US sizes).

I‚Äôd like the 975 because it‚Äôs more comfortable, I already know what size I need, it has a lower neckline and I think it would be more breathable (preferable as we‚Äôre moving into summer here).

Also, sometimes I think I do like my chest and I‚Äôm a little worried about sagging. It seems likely that once I get it I‚Äôm going to want to wear it all the time, especially if it‚Äôs
comfortable. I almost always want a flat chest under clothes but I think I actually like my breasts sometimes when I‚Äôm topless (I kind of feel like an art piece? Anyway, not relevant haha).

I‚Äôd like the tri-top 983 because of the compression. It seems like I might need it to get the effect that I‚Äôm hoping for. I‚Äôm a bit worried that there‚Äôs no point getting a binder if I **don‚Äôt** choose this one. As mentioned, I‚Äôm used to wearing sports bras which have some level of compression, and I‚Äôm investing in a binder because I‚Äôd like to try something new and more compress-y. That said, if I got this one and it was really uncomfortable and I was worried about sagging, I would probably wear it less and alternate with the sports bras.

TL;DR: Does anyone have experience with both or either binder? Compression, comfort, visibility under clothes, rolling up, getting itchy, anything that has been important for you :)

This will be my first binder, I ordered the cotton-lined 975 in a medium a week or two ago and it was too loose so I posted it back and have just been given the code to order another.\n\nI‚Äôve been wearing just those nike sports bra/crops for a while now but I think I‚Äôm usually a 10DD or 12D size wise (32DD or 34D in US sizes).\n\nI‚Äôd like the 975 because it‚Äôs more comfortable, I already know what size I need, it has a lower neckline and I think it would be more breathable (preferable as we‚Äôre moving into summer here).\n\nAlso, sometimes I think I do like my chest and I‚Äôm a little worried about sagging. It seems likely that once I get it I‚Äôm going to want to wear it all the time, especially if it‚Äôs\ncomfortable. I almost always want a flat chest under clothes but I think I actually like my breasts sometimes when I‚Äôm topless (I kind of feel like an art piece? Anyway, not relevant haha).\n\nI‚Äôd like the tri-top 983 because of the compression. It seems like I might need it to get the effect that I‚Äôm hoping for. I‚Äôm a bit worried that there‚Äôs no point getting a binder if I **don‚Äôt** choose this one. As mentioned, I‚Äôm used to wearing sports bras which have some level of compression, and I‚Äôm investing in a binder because I‚Äôd like to try something new and more compress-y. That said, if I got this one and it was really uncomfortable and I was worried about sagging, I would probably wear it less and alternate with the sports bras.\n\nTL;DR: Does anyone have experience with both or either binder? Compression, comfort, visibility under clothes, rolling up, getting itchy, anything that has been important for you :)\nAlso, any thoughts in general are very welcome!\n\nVere (they/them)', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Underworks binders (tri-top 983 vs cotton 975)', 'created': 1571812370.0}"

about five years ago i came out to my mom in the target parking lot. i told her i was ftm trans and bisexual. she basically flat out told me i wasn‚Äôt. she said that she knew a lot of friends when she was a kid that were gay, bi, and lesbian and told all these stories about how they all grew out of it. i was too shaken, anxiety ridden and terrified of my mother to say anything, to at least let her know that these things aren‚Äôt up for debate and i wasn‚Äôt asking for her opinion on whether she thinks i‚Äôm bluffing.

i wound up coming out to my school as trans male and went by he/him and a chosen name i no longer use. it was a hell of a battle to convince them to let me socially transition without notifying my parents. it felt like hell to walk on egg shells the entire year and live in constant fear of my teachers or friends slipping up. by the end of the year i found myself hating my name. not so much the pronouns but i was tired of the chosen name. i took this as my mother being right and me not actually being trans. we moved to a different state at the end of that year and i stopped using the name and pronouns, went back to my birth name and she/her, shoved myself back in the closet.

fast forward five years later i finally figured it out. i feel the same, i just have different and more accurate words to describe how i feel. i‚Äôm not bi, i‚Äôm queer. i like guys, girls, and everything in between. i‚Äôm non-binary transmasc. i still like he/him but they/them is okay too. i have a new chosen name that i like a lot more. i came out to my friends over the summer and my school at the beginning of this year. all of my friends accepted me. i had my entire GSA club to back me up. 

i still have to come out though. i‚Äôm not old enough to move out, as i‚Äôm a sophomore in high school. i cannot take it anymore, i am so tired of hiding myself out of fear of my mother and her reaction. i know my dad will accept me but i have to tell her first. if i tell him, the first thing he‚Äôs gonna ask is what my mother thinks about it. and when he finds out what she thinks about it he‚Äôs gonna throw a shit fit and i‚Äôm gonna get the worst of it. 

i don‚Äôt know what to do about my mom. she refuses to accept trans people and says it‚Äôs fake and she‚Äôs also really homophobic, even though she says she‚Äôs not. she‚Äôll say she doesn‚Äôt mind gay people and then turns around and talks about how disgusting they are. my best idea is to fill my therapist in on all of this and hopefully sit my mom down in her office and talk to her about it in a controlled environment where we can both be heard and talk without getting interrupted. my mom tends to get extremely heated and only cares about what she has to say during arguments. i think a referee would be good for her, especially when this is a moment where i need her to listen more than ever.

She said she would try to use they/them pronouns but reiterated that I should *definitely* get therapy so I could find out the real reason I‚Äôm ‚Äúunhappy‚Äù with my body.

however, i was always very confused about pansexuality. i think i‚Äôm still bisexual, but recently i‚Äôve been wondering what labels come in. 

recently, i‚Äôve been crushing on this nb person at my school. but in the beginning i assumed they were a girl, but they have come out to me as nb. it didn‚Äôt really affect how i looked at them, bc i still really really like them. 

the problem is that i think this goes under bisexuality??? but i‚Äôm not sure. bc people talk about polysexual and that sort of stuff, but it doesn‚Äôt resonate w me as much as bisexuality does. bc i still have a preference...

i hope this doesn‚Äôt sound offensive bc i actually don‚Äôt know T^T

i just need help figuring out if the bisexuality label is okay. i‚Äôve been looking at lesbians who like cis girls and nb as well and it‚Äôs still very confusing to me. most people say its not really wrong, bc people‚Äôs preferences can be a spectrum, but it‚Äôs still pretty confusing bc i kinda want to know whats going on with me. 

i also need help on figuring out if i do like femme? nb. i haven‚Äôt looked into the spectrum of nb but people are saying femme nb which i‚Äôm assuming is people who are more femme/present femme. my crush is very neutral, but they don‚Äôt like fem things like dresses and stuff. but, i wouldn‚Äôt call them more masculine either. so i don‚Äôt know if this is a preference including a certain type of nb. 

i also have been trying to learn more about nb bc i really like this person and want to do the right thing. i‚Äôm sure this situation has occurred before, so let me know if i should know anything about nb people to make them feel safe and valid. 

again i hope i wasn‚Äôt offensive in this. i‚Äôm really open minded to hear what i should do or say, or if i am saying smth wrong. nb is not new to me, but i think it‚Äôs more than i thought it was.

I'm huge, hairy, and I mean, I can drift into chunky andro territory but, like, today I had a major site meeting, hosting a dozen contractors for a bid kick-off and I just put it all away and presented completely male. Button up, jeans, safety boots, at best I got a ponytail happening but that ain't exactly screaming 'wooo femme'. For this job I've got 30 guys in a room, total sausage party, and I just couldn't. I had to hide, and it makes me feel like I'm living a complete lie. This is happening more and more when I drop into boymode. IT's either I'm terrified or I'm exhausted, like when I had the flu I just couldn't put any effort into the upkeep required to knock back the masc (shave, tuck, wear anything but t-shirt and sweatpants). 

I manage to bring some femme into my daily life, I am on HRT, I am growing teh boobs, I have long hair and want it longer, I tuck and generally am in jeggings, yoga pants or the like. 

But, a line I cross where I feel, frankly, like a fraud. That I'm not really trans, that I'm just a sorta life-crippled pretender, because frankly I'll never pass. I love dresses, I love skirts, I wish to god my shoulders weren't so broad (and hairy) so I could feel comfy with off-the-shoulder stuff. 

Still, even with decent makeup and a denim dress and as much femme as I can pump into my plump-bodied gender-addled frame I still feel like I'm totally fucking full of shit because I'm not doing electro (can't really afford it right now) and I'm not probably ever going to make it into a 'full' transition. I'm not even sure it's possible at my age (42, I'm that weird old enby). 

Pardon the rambling, pardon the bullshit, I just, I talked about this with my pshrink today but it's still a thorn in my side. I don't know if I'm more torn up about not being able to pass, or that the world isn't really open to enbies who just fuckin' well publicly fail at gender.

Button up, jeans, safety boots, at best I got a ponytail happening but that ain't exactly screaming 'wooo femme'. For this job I've got 30 guys in a room, total sausage party, and I just couldn't. I had to hide, and it makes me feel like I'm living a complete lie. This is happening more and more when I drop into boymode.

That I'm not really trans, that I'm just a sorta life-crippled pretender, because frankly I'll never pass.

I'm not even sure it's possible at my age (42, I'm that weird old enby). \n\nPardon the rambling, pardon the bullshit, I just, I talked about this with my pshrink today but it's still a thorn in my side.

I‚Äôm afab in my late 20s and I pretty recently came to the realization that I‚Äôm nonbinary. Things I get dysphoric about are my hips (super wide), my reproductive system, and my genitals. My chest doesn‚Äôt really give me dysphoria, but I do wish I had a smaller chest size because it feels too feminine with the size it is now. I often wear a binder, but I want them to be small so I can bind more easily but also have some shape if I want to go without the binder and am feeling more feminine. But I‚Äôm getting off topic here. The biggest thing that gives me dysphoria is my bottom situation. 

My entire life it‚Äôs just never felt right. I remember being really young, like maybe 7 or 8, and stuffing things inside my pants like socks or washcloths because it felt right. I would also try to make homemade STP devices because I really wanted to be able to pee standing up. When I started masturbating I couldn‚Äôt touch myself because it didn‚Äôt feel right. Not because I was afraid to masturbate, but because it just didn‚Äôt feel like the right parts. So I would do it over my clothing or just by humping something. The only time I could ever orgasm was when I imagined that I had a penis. Anytime I thought about my biological anatomy it just always turned me off. 

I was always very confused by this because I didn‚Äôt feel like a boy, and I didn‚Äôt feel like a girl either but rather something in between, but having a penis felt right to me. So when I came out as liking women at 15, I just thought somehow it was because I was gay. But then when I was around 20, I discovered the term nonbinary, and it made sense. It felt like that fit my description. So I talked to my friend about it, and she was just really confused since this was 2012 and there was no nonbinary representation anywhere, and it wasn‚Äôt even really talked about. So she had no idea what I was talking about and kept asking me if I was androgynous. Then I felt super weird and just was like, ah nevermind and pushed all that stuff down. I just told myself that I was a woman and that was that. 

But of course, ignoring your identity only lasts so long. So now I‚Äôve opened it all back up and where I was able to just ignore it before, everything is too difficult to ignore now. Now when I get dysphoria, because I know that I have the option to change parts of the outside to fit the inside a little better, it‚Äôs harder to deal with the things that feel wrong. Sometimes I‚Äôm not thinking about my bottom situation, but when I do it hits really hard and it‚Äôs almost unbearable. I have a really nice 4 in 1 packer that helps sometimes, and masturbating with it is amazing, but sometimes it‚Äôs not enough and I just want a real penis. And I‚Äôll literally sob because it feels so wrong having just empty space, and I don‚Äôt always get that mental connection with the packer feeling like my own body part. Maybe one day I‚Äôll get a meta, but I‚Äôd need to go on T first and get some bottom growth, and I‚Äôm not even sure if I want to go on T because I really don‚Äôt want my voice to change. I like what it is now, and I‚Äôm a singer and don‚Äôt want that to change. T would help some things, but it would take away some others that I like about my body. So I‚Äôm really torn on that.

Not because I was afraid to masturbate, but because it just didn‚Äôt feel like the right parts. So I would do it over my clothing or just by humping something. The only time I could ever orgasm was when I imagined that I had a penis. Anytime I thought about my biological anatomy it just always turned me off. 

I was always very confused by this because I didn‚Äôt feel like a boy, and I didn‚Äôt feel like a girl either but rather something in between, but having a penis felt right to me. So when I came out as liking women at 15, I just thought somehow it was because I was gay. But then when I was around 20, I discovered the term nonbinary, and it made sense. It felt like that fit my description. So I talked to my friend about it, and she was just really confused since this was 2012 and there was no nonbinary representation anywhere, and it wasn‚Äôt even really talked about. So she had no idea what I was talking about and kept asking me if I was androgynous. Then I felt super weird and just was like, ah nevermind and pushed all that stuff down. I just told myself that I was a woman and that was that. 

But of course, ignoring your identity only lasts so long. So now I‚Äôve opened it all back up and where I was able to just ignore it before, everything is too difficult to ignore now. Now when I get dysphoria, because I know that I have the option to change parts of the outside to fit the inside a little better, it‚Äôs harder to deal with the things that feel wrong. Sometimes I‚Äôm not thinking about my bottom situation, but when I do it hits really hard and it‚Äôs almost unbearable. I have a really nice 4 in 1 packer that helps sometimes, and masturbating with it is amazing, but sometimes it‚Äôs not enough and I just want a real penis. And I‚Äôll literally sob because it feels so wrong having just empty space, and I don‚Äôt always get that mental connection with the packer feeling like my own body part. Maybe one day I‚Äôll get a meta, but I‚Äôd need to go on T first and get some bottom growth, and I‚Äôm not even sure if I want to go on T because I really don‚Äôt want my voice to change. I like what it is now, and I‚Äôm a singer and don‚Äôt want that to change. T would help some things, but it would take away some others that I like about my body. So I‚Äôm really torn on that.

I'm AFAB and have thought of myself as ""mostly girl"" for quite some time now. I've been doing some soul-searching for the past week or so, and once I started genuinely thinking of myself as nonbinary, I started feeling... better? I see all the pictures on here, and some of them feel like goals or something to be envious of.

I have spent so, so much of my life feeling odd and existing in a space adjacent to reality. I can't ever pick favorites of anything. I've never felt any connection to my IRL name. I've had several incidents where people were unsure of my gender, and they felt really great. I remember them fondly.

I've spent so much time feeling jumbled and messy and lost, for seemingly no reason. Nothing I've ever been able to pinpoint. Just restlessness, anxiety, depression--you name it.

But looking at this sub and other trans/enby subs has calmed the angry spirit inside of me, the spirit that has been waging war with itself for so long. I've even been described as an angry person before, even though I'm really not.

Like turning a maelstrom into a rainbow, a tiger into a house cat, a scribble into a mural.

It was dysphoria. Dysphoria is what has kept me restless and unstable.

So here I am. I'm a demigirl.

A demigirl has two genders, typically. One is being a girl/woman/female. The other one varies for each person. Mine is an androgyne (maybe agender?).

I'm still figuring things out, of course. But this has been a really productive week in self-discovery.

Because I'm AFAB, and being a demigirl isn't a big enough difference for cis people to understand, I will most likely never be able to come out.

2019-10-28 17:13:57,dobuf2,7,11,"TL;DR at the bottom.

Sorry for formatting, I'm on mobile, I'll try to fix it tonight on my laptop.

So I have been battling with the shitty topic that is gender for about two years now. At first I thought I was a trans girl, then I thought I was cis, but about two months ago I finally felt comfortable with identifying as non-binary. Yay!

So before I get into the recent events, I'd like to give a bit of backstory. I'm bisexual, and I have been for several years. I came out to my family last June to a mostly positive response, but I told my sister in March for two reasons: 1) to get a general feel for how the rest of my family would react, and 2) my sister is the most important person in the world to me, and I love her with all of my heart, so it's natural to want to tell her first.

When I told the rest of my family, my mother threw a huge fit at me because I didn't ""trust her enough"" to come out to her first. She was ""really hurt"" and didn't talk to me for about two days. Afterwards, she said she'll be happy for me to be with whoever I want to be and she will always support me. Well, talk is cheap.

Now, on to the recent events. Last weekend, I was talking with some friends who I'm out to about when I should come out as NB to my family, since I would love to be able to present and dress less masc. One person suggested I do it the following week (last week at the time of this posting), so I agreed for Wednesday. My mom was off of work that day and I have an early class, so I had the whole day to figure out what I would say to her.

Wednesday night, I go in her room and tell her I need to talk to her. Fast-forward about 10 minutes, I tell her that I identify as non-binary and to keep it on the down-low from the rest of the family for a while. She's a bit confused by it all but agrees to respect my privacy. She refused to use my chosen name ""Chris"" over my birth name because ""I've been calling you that for twenty years"" and still uses he/him, but... we can work on that, right?

Jump ahead to Saturday, my mother was getting ready to go to a party. She comes into my room to say goodbye to me, and I ask her if she has any questions about me being NB. She says not right now, since she's been talking to my sister trying to figure things out. I ask her why she told my sister when I explicitly told her to not tell anyone else. She said she didn't think it was that big of a deal, and we got in a short argument about it before she left.

I texted my sister about it and she said she was ""extremely hurt that I didn't tell her myself"" that I was NB. I couldn't believe she was turning it around on me, so I asked her if she was being serious. We got in an argument over text and that didn't end well either.

My sister isn't responding to my calls or texts, and my mother is refusing to acknowledge my presence. To my knowledge, the rest of my family (two aunts and grandmother) don't know I'm NB, so they've been acting like normal. They just assumed my mother and I got in a fight. Was it wrong of me to get offended over my mother telling my sister?

**TL;DR**: I came out to my mom as NB, told her to keep it between us. She told my sister, I told my mother that broke my trust in her and made me upset. My sister is defending my mother's choice about telling her and is spinning it around on me for not telling her first. Neither my mother nor my sister will talk to me now.

My boobs or naturally the tiniest boobs you could possibly have, so its not like I could just wear a binder and thats it (wearing a binder wouldn't change anything they're that small! people think I'm a male all the time, it's annoying) But it's more that they're there and I can't go like shirtless or anything. And its a really annoying! But I'm not trans cause I'm quite happy with my bottom half without a penis!

Another thing to rant about is people thinking I'm physically male whenever I go to the bathroom and try to redirect me away from the female bathroom (there are extremely limited intersex bathrooms in the city I live in) to the male bathroom, then I tell them I'm physically a female and they think I'm trans and I'm like no. just no. It's really fuckin' annoying!

Another thing (sorry!) is I just went on school camp and a thing i've got for when people complain you accidently flashed them you're tits is ""I don't identify with them so you can't complain!"". It's really good and shuts people up straight away and it lessen the gender dysphoria I have about my tits!

Please reply if you have any of these issues!

2019-10-29 12:41:19,dop87g,9,8,"I'm and nb business consultant and I've recently started chatting with a friend who works in fashion design about the possibility of starting a clothing store that focuses on gender nonconformity, gender-bending, and androgeny.

One of the problems I have had, being 40, is that most of the nonbinary designs that are out there focus on younger people whose fahion needs are different than my own. So, a big part of our discussions have been around how to diversify the availability of nb fashion to appeal to people who are struggling with their body shape, their personal style, or even just finding a store that makes them feel welcome.

The issue we are currently having is deciding what type of design would work best. As a designer, they like the idea of focusing on higher end, more bespoke or customised clothing. I, on the other hand, have been more interested in more accessible clothing that could appeal to a broader group of people who maybe don't have the money to spend on a more expensive outfit that they couldn't wear every day.

Market research hasn't turned up much - the limited number of fashion places focused on this market seem to be in a weird place where they want to take advantage of people with niche fashion needs by overcharging for somewhat boring products. So, I thought that I would ask here, if anyone was interested, in what your fashion needs are?

What sort of a shop would make you feel more welcome? What types of clothing would you like to have more access to? Would you be interested in a curated collection of items from other brands that were chosen specifically for their suitability to diverse body shapes and gender roles, or would you rather see clothing that was specifically designed to target nb folks (as opposed to designs that are gender-focused but could be appropriated into a non-conforming look)?

Any thoughts you'd feel comfortable sharing would be appreciated.

I never questioned my gender because I didn‚Äôt think I could. I just knew something was off. I didn‚Äôt attribute it to my gender, I just thought I was an outsider for a million reasons, my specific circumstances were such that I was an immigrant where I grew up so I never felt like I belonged anywhere ever and where I happened to grow up was an extremely nationalistic racist nation.

Fact remains. I never thought about gender ever. I just thought about me as me. There was somewhat of a disconnect as I grew older. I accepted that I was bisexual initially because I didn‚Äôt care about gender, I just cared about people  as individuals. Then when I became about of the misogyny of my particular culture I made a conscious stance to become a radical feminist and a staunch lesbian. 

As time went on and I became educated on the ways of the world. I began to seek therapy for my own personal damage and fault. As I opened up to my therapist about how I felt I fit in the world, they introduced me to the concept of non-binary. 


Since that day, everything just clicked in. As cheesy as it sounds, my life just in a blink of an eye just fell into place. Everything I‚Äôve ever wondered just made sense. I don‚Äôt know how describe the feeling without seeming hyperbolic and mystic.

Then when I became about of the misogyny of my particular culture I made a conscious stance to become a radical feminist and a staunch lesbian. \n\nAs time went on and I became educated on the ways of the world. I began to seek therapy for my own personal damage and fault. As I opened up to my therapist about how I felt I fit in the world, they introduced me to the concept of non-binary. \n\n\nSince that day, everything just clicked in. As cheesy as it sounds, my life just in a blink of an eye just fell into place. Everything I‚Äôve ever wondered just made sense. I don‚Äôt know how describe the feeling without seeming hyperbolic and mystic. But it just all made sense to me and I was suddenly washed over by a warming sense of comfort that I‚Äôve never felt before in my life.\n\nIn that instant I just knew I was always non-binary. As little as I knew about it at the time, I‚Äôve never felt more understood in my life.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'I‚Äôve just come to terms with being non-binary, how to do I break it to everyone else?', 'created': 1572430452.0}"

From the number of upvotes and comments, however, it's clearly a big draw of the sub and we'd like to keep those interactions while trying to make it a little easier for the sub to also serve other purposes. 

If you would like to view the sub without selfies, a quick and dirty way to do this is by c/ping the following into the search bar:

The custom search parameters will work regardless of which reddit you use, your site preferences, or platform.

(Sorry for any grammar/ortography mistakes, as english isn't my first language, it can be a bit rusty)

Giving some context, I've got this history teacher who always, when he talks with the class, what is lot, says about some themes as feminism, LGBTQ+, racism, social issues, reality, depression, adolescence and others in a really well rounded and based way. He is probably my favorite teacher this year, and in some sense, giving the fact that I already've gotten some counseling from him, I trust him.

So, I'm non-binary, specifically demigender, and bisexual. About my sexuality, I'm out of the closet, even to my parents. Some of my friends know about my gender, most not, but in those past two years (I'm yet 15yo) I've done a pretty good job on getting to understand and accept more myself. On this case, thank you Levy (it's not their real name) for being this amazing enby friend of mine.

Now to the actual thing,

while I was talking with Levy, I got this taught: ""Wait, teachers should be able to help and counsel students? Right?"". We live in Brazil, and here people have a really big bias against the LGBTQ+ community, and I was really needing counseling from an adult recently, as everyone who knew was around my age, or a bit older, and this teacher instantly came to my mind. Levy was like ""OH NO, AREN'T YOU THINKING WHAT I'M THINKING?!?"", and I was like ""Yeah"".

So, one week past and I was in a really bad day. Disphoria was killing me, I was sad with some of my friends and colleagues, so I was like, ""Why not?"". Then his lesson came, and at the end I asked him if I could speak with him at the pause, and he went, ""Come, speak now"".

My head was on full speed, and we went out of the classroom to talk in privacy cause I asked, then, I said, looking down, fearful and going all in this bet: ""So, I'm not a man, nor a woman..."". He was like ""Didn't expect this"", but he took a breath and started to talk calmly.

First he calmed me down, and asked how I saw myself, if someone knew, and many other well done questions, without getting agressive or disrespectful even once. 3 minutes pass and he starts saying things that I really should know, and I was just so bad to notice it.

That I'm really well, in the sense of in a good way.

He made me notice that, for having people who know and support me, having someone, even if only a cousin to count on in my family, to already have accepted myself as non binary, while others struggle to even know this, and other many other things that really made me think how I'm really well, when I could just have done everything wrong. He also said that he could keep talking to me when I needed, man, this dude is awesome.

In this time he once said ""You're a really intelligent boy"", and instantly he stopped and asked if he should call me this way, or which pronoun to use in a very polite way. I said that I don't have problems, and any of them are ok. He even recomended me to talk to a transmasc high school student on the school (which I already talk, ha) and a documentary about a non binary person.

That day I also went for the first time to gym, random thing but a win to me.

One day passes (it's today), and I'm like, insanely happy going crazy with Levy. His class comes (we have classes with him twice a week) and while he class, he says ""voc√™s, meninos, meninas... e meninxs"", it has no direct translation to english, but would be some thing like ""you, boys, girls... and (insert gender neutral equivalent)"", an then he looks to me. Man, I instantly got red, nobody in the class got the meaning of this, but me and Levy. I looked to them and they were like, laughing to me, I was laughing, which is rare. Ok it actually isn't the best way to refer to nb persons, as it's hard to speak, and mainly for blind people to understand using a programm to read on cellphones, but even I didn't know that until some time ago, and it stills valid, as it shows that he cares about how I'm feeling and how I see myself.

This alone made two of my last days incredibly amazing. It's too good to know that, even slowly, things are going well and I'm starting to go out of the closet. Me and Levy are planning to out ourselves to our friends on the nb day on the pride month next year, but we still don't know.

It hasn't been an issue, but today they were feeling major dysphoria. My question is, how can I help them? Is there anything I can do or do I just be a silent support? I love them so much and it breaks my heart to hear them cry that they'll never get to be a pretty girl. To me, they are the most beautiful girl, handsome man, and attractive person I've ever met. How do I help them feel that way?"", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Help with NB partner', 'created': 1572516432.0}"

I am really disgusted and told him I don't want him to come anymore. I honestly don't want anything to do with him. This guy thinks I am being petty over this issue. 

My roommate told me that they don't really care and would be willing to go away while my friend is here, and I was absolutely shocked. Why should THEY have to leave because this guy is a bigot?
