I‚Äôm going to start a gofundme to save up some for top surgery. Yay!! 


I‚Äôm unsure if I want nipple grafts or not. I plan on getting double incision, and I‚Äôve heard healing after surgery is easier without nipples. I‚Äôve also heard it can be slightly less expensive, a HUGE plus if possible. 


Im unemployed and i have ptsd, cant work atm. Had to quit my job cause I kept having panic attacks at work and i couldnt take it anymore. I got diagnosed with ptsd, trying to get my shit together and heal. I likely wont be able to use my insurance since im covered through my conservative christian grandfather‚Äôs military insurance, and there‚Äôs no way they‚Äôd cover it if I‚Äôm not on T. I know of a relatively local doctor who‚Äôll do top surgery on enby folks not on T as long as they have a therapist note. So my plan is to crowdfund the money and get the surgery. I might as well try, hope of improvement feels better than sitting and doing nothing.



TLDR: Does getting nipple grafts or not getting nipple grafts effect the price/healing time of surgery? Are there any better options for healthcare crowdfunding, or is gofundme my best bet for US?

I asked his permission to share the copypasta here because my buddy here makes some very enlightened points that made me think ""shit, I really, really needed to hear this. Other people might need to hear it too"". It's a lengthy post, but it's all tiny stream-of-consciousness text-chatter, so it's actually a relatively short read. I decided to share the entire transcript because...trans solidarity in action, yo. ~~Also maybe I'm biased but my bud and I have great chemistry and could TOTALLY make this a podcast kinda deal.~~

 

***ME:***

* \[figuring out my gender\] has definitely been a Struggle
* half the battle has been accepting that I don't have all the answers yet, and the ones I do have might not line up with other people's, but that's okay and doesn't make my daily experiences any less real

&amp;#x200B;

***HIM:***

* Hey, figuring out you don't have to have it all figured out is a big thing too
* Hey, do you mind me asking- what are your pronouns? I know you were considering using they or she, but now I don't remember which you settled with.  


***ME:***

* still going by she/her irl while I figure shit out, but I appreciate they/them or he/him

  
***HIM:***

* Any preference on which?

  
***ME:***

* honestly any tbh! pronouns aren't really a source of dysphoria for me or anything, mostly I just enjoy hearing pronouns that aren't she/her because it feels Validating. (I'm leaning towards IDing as nonbinary-transmasculine? my gender identity's kinda all over the place but my relationship with my body is def very male-esque and I'm weighing up eventually trying to get on T)

&amp;#x200B;

***HIM:***

* Ah I can relate to that
* Back when I thought I was NB, it was the ""not she"" that relieved dysphoria, and then I finally realized that ""he"" actually added euphoria  


***ME:***

* yeah, makes a lot of sense that your understanding would progress like that!

  
***HIM:***

* Well the important part is honestly what makes you feel best
* And fuck everyone who says different

&amp;#x200B;

***ME:***

* I keep stressing myself out thinking ""I'm not guy enough"" (read: not trans enough) and keep having to remind myself that it's okay I don't have to BE a guy
* I just want to be a damn handsome human being

  
***HIM:***

* I don't wanna be that guy but stressing out you're not trans enough is often a symptom of dysphoria

  
***ME:***

* that's actually really validating to hear, haha

  
***HIM:***

* The ""man I wish I was trans enough"" thought train
* But yeah (1) you don't have to be a guy and (2) there's no wrong way to be a guy either
* Or a girl, or NB for that matter

  
***ME:***

* I really needed to hear this shit. thanks man
* honestly I was obsessing for such a long-ass time and making myself mentally ill over it....while completely missing the forest for the trees because cis people don't stress themselves to sickness over their gender

  
***HIM:***

* Side note
* If it's ok for a cis guy to be gnc (and it totally is), it's ok for a trans guy to be GNC too
* Right!! That too
* I went through my whole girly girl phase bc I was kinda trying to force myself to be a woman without any real understanding of womanhood
* In essence, I spent several years being exactly what TERFs try to convince people trans women are
* Based on stereotype and shallow reflection
* And being true to myself actually helped me have a less toxic relation to femininity as a whole, ironically

  
***ME:***

* that's awesome though
* I mean, it makes sense that once you felt secure in who you were, you'd have a better relationship to femininity when you didn't feel the need to shove your face into it

  
***HIM:***

* I‚Äôm kinda on the 'when I pass' train rn but
* When I pass I wanna start wearing some women's clothing, etc., and it's less
* Exactly
* Shoving my face into it and more exploring it as an option
* It's a game of 'wanna be seen as a girlish man not a mannish girl' in my head tbh

  
***ME:***

* I was wondering for a long time whether I could ""really"" be NB because ‚Äî besides the concept being still relatively new to me ‚Äî I didn't really...feel like I was in the ""wrong"" body as a kid or teen. I don't know that I've ever been traditionally dysphoric in a physical sense, not until very recently when I've become hyper aware that the way people look at me isn't the way I see myself

  
***HIM:***

* Well there's no one set way to feel dysphoria
* You may not agree with me, but I believe that dysphoria is kind of the defining factor of being trans
* Just that people misunderstand what it is
* It's not one SET experience
* More a definition enclosing any and all ""I'm not comfortable as my SAB"" and/or ""I feel better as another gender""
* I just really resent that people use it to try and push ""you're not trans if you don't experience dysphoria MY WAY""

  
***ME:***

* yeah man, I can get behind that

  
***HIM:***

* Which is where the whole ""you don't need dysphoria"" backlash began in my experience
* From the bleachers in a sense

  
***ME:***

* yeah there seems to be a narrative that you can only be trans if your body brings you excruciating, unavoidable pain and it's like...whoa, there. I get that's a completely legit thing a lot of trans people do experience, but that's also really fucking bleak to have a bar of ""you must suffer this much to ride""

  
***HIM:***

* Like... Okay a bit tmi but. For example I don't think about my genitals 9/10 times
* I‚Äôm ace, I rarely need to use them, but
* I‚Äôd be fine enough if a proper dick technology didn't happen in my life

  
***ME:***

* also: the pain of getting your dick stuck in a zipper

  
***HIM:***

* But I can't go through my life without getting rid of the bouncy annoyances on my chest

  
***ME:***

* who needs it
* ahahah legit  


***HIM:***

* Like would I like a dick? Yeees. But am I gonna be in pain every time I exist? No.
* And then there's like
* Smaller stuff that is more dysphoric
* Voice
* Arm hair (don't laugh)
* Bone structure but I can't fix that  


***ME:***

* I won't laugh I want hairier legs

  
***HIM:***

* My wrists arent five inches around
* I have princess hands
* :(

&amp;#x200B;

***ME:***

* SAME, tiny hands

&amp;#x200B;

***HIM:***

* Like, can't find a smart watch that won't give me the stereotypical Chinese hat effect
* *\[drawn diagram of a skinny-ass wrist with a disproportionately big watch-face strapped to it\]*
* You know what I mean?
* I have one from Amazon that has decently good reviews and I hope is small and comfy enough
* Lol even a Mi band is too big and it pisses me uffff

&amp;#x200B;

***ME:***

* I feel like, for the most part, I like my body. I'm not dysphoric when I look in the mirror. would I like a flat chest? yes, at least when I'm wearing a shirt. but I don't mind my boobs. when I look in the mirror I actually like what I see. I see my androgynous features and fluffy-ass hair and broad shoulders and I'm like ""hayyyyyy there, handsome boi-o""
* ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and then I go serve customers at work, and get called ""darling"" by some over friendly dude, and am super aware of how high my voice is in customer service mode, and feel suddenly overwhelmed that people are looking at me and reading me as female
* I‚Äôm not dysphoric until I'm exposed to other people's perceptions of me
* AND HAHAH YES I TOTALLY GET UR WATCH ANALOGY
* but yeah people don't see me how I see myself
* like when I post selfies and get told (well-meaningly) that I'm ""pretty""

  
***HIM:***

* Hmm, I look in the mirror with a shirt on and see a guy
* But I look in the mirror with my shirt off and see a guy with the wrong stuff on his chest
* Like
* It shouldn't be connected to my androgynous looking parts
* If that makes sense?

&amp;#x200B;

***ME:***

* yeah that makes sense my dude  


***HIM:***

* I for one think you're dashing

  
***ME:***

* aw shucks

  
***HIM:***

* But the other people's perception dysphoria is something I've never been able to really verbalize like you just did
* I‚Äôm going about my day and suddenly it's you (fem) or madam and it's just. No don't look at me, can I go in a hole and not be seen
* You expressed it so well

  
***ME:***

* god it's great having other trans people to talk to. I feel like we can fill in the blanks in each other's vernacular
* (idk if that's the right word for it or not, but like, def some experiences are hard to verbalise or even put your finger on until someone else is like ""okay so"" and you're like ""YES. YES THAT"")

  
***HIM:***

* Sounds right to me

  
***ME:***

* (‚Äúthat is a thing that happens to me too but I've never known how to call it"")

  
***HIM:***

* I call it same hat syndrome haha

  
***ME:***

* great name

  
***HIM:***

* Like I have cis friends I can trust and tell about these things, but when I meet another trans person it's like, hey! You understand this from the inside!
* Kinda like meeting another aspie in my case
* ‚Äòyes you understand why I'd rather be hungry for hours than eat That Texture ever again'

  
***ME:***

* yeah I feel the same when talking with other bi people or other depressives
* there's something to be said for sharing experiences
* and having walked the same paths

  
**HIM:**

* I think the term same hat syndrome should be widely used tbt

I don't know. I just left that conversation last night feeling so invalidated, and it just made it worse when my boyfriend said the usual cutesy boyfriend things. (Not gonna go into details but basically just calling me or referring to how I'm a girl/how I'm cute. lmao)

I‚Äôm 21 AFAB (normally wouldn‚Äôt list my AGAB but I think it‚Äôs relevant here in the context of socialization and such) and have been reflecting a lot lately on my past (lesbian-coded) relationships. I went through a breakup a few months back with a girl I was falling in love with for my inability to stick up for myself (in a way that was going to interfere with our relationship). Since the breakup I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about my roles in romantic relationships, and the greater world. 

I find myself to be a very passive person. I have historically had issues with getting pushed around, not asserting my desires, kind of just generally trying too hard to be a people pleaser. In relationships I often find myself yielding to whatever my partner wants‚Äîif they‚Äôre happy, I‚Äôm happy! I‚Äôd let them pick the dates and things of that nature. 

But I often find myself in general wanting to take a more masculine presence in this world. But I still want to be soft and gentle. I want to have a commanding presence, I want to lead, I want to support other people. But I don‚Äôt think I really know how to do that. 

I was journalling before and without much conscious thought I wrote, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to be a lady, I don‚Äôt know how to be a gentleman.‚Äù 

I don‚Äôt think I know how to be the ‚Äúlady‚Äù in a relationship either. I struggle to accept compliments, I struggle to show appreciation for my partner‚Äôs efforts even when I feel appreciation inside my mind, I find a lot of discomfort letting myself be truly submissive in intimate contexts‚Äîgeneral vulnerability issues, I guess. 

I apologize for all the heteronormative language in describing this. It‚Äôs just the only language I have. But I recognize all of this is WAY more fluid than that. 

I guess I‚Äôm just confused about how I see myself in relationships, because I don‚Äôt feel I ever truly learned how to perform fully one of the ‚Äúsocietally acceptable‚Äù ways of being in a relationship, and so I was never able to reject it either.

In relationships I often find myself yielding to whatever my partner wants‚Äîif they‚Äôre happy, I‚Äôm happy! I‚Äôd let them pick the dates and things of that nature. \n\nBut I often find myself in general wanting to take a more masculine presence in this world. But I still want to be soft and gentle. I want to have a commanding presence, I want to lead, I want to support other people. But I don‚Äôt think I really know how to do that. \n\nI was journalling before and without much conscious thought I wrote, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to be a lady, I don‚Äôt know how to be a gentleman.‚Äù \n\nI don‚Äôt think I know how to be the ‚Äúlady‚Äù in a relationship either. I struggle to accept compliments, I struggle to show appreciation for my partner‚Äôs efforts even when I feel appreciation inside my mind, I find a lot of discomfort letting myself be truly submissive in intimate contexts‚Äîgeneral vulnerability issues, I guess. \n\nI apologize for all the heteronormative language in describing this. It‚Äôs just the only language I have. But I recognize all of this is WAY more fluid than that. \n\nI guess I‚Äôm just confused about how I see myself in relationships, because I don‚Äôt feel I ever truly learned how to perform fully one of the ‚Äúsocietally acceptable‚Äù ways of being in a relationship, and so I was never able to reject it either. I‚Äôm struggling with feeling that I‚Äôm not enough of anything in a relationship.\n\nDoes anyone else struggle with this?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in my thirties, AMAB, and basically been a ""man"" to the public my entire life. I came out as bi in college, but the idea of gender is not something I've ever talked about with anyone. The only person who knows what I'm about to say is my wife.

&amp;#x200B;

Not all the time, but sometimes I like makeup. Sometimes I like cute dresses and such. I worry about not being manly in front of other people. I'm not aggressive enough and wonder if I was born with low testosterone. I fantasize about having different parts, but I've never felt like I was 'born in the wrong body'. I don't want to transition. I don't know what dysphoria feels like but I don't think I experience it. I feel uncomfortable claiming a trans label because of this but feel more comfortable with something like gender fluid or nb. 

But then sometimes I think that I'm overthinking it and I'm just a cross-dresser and should stop acting like I belong.

I have a pretty intense impostor syndrome because of all the things I listed above and because everyone assumes I'm cis, I feel like I don't have the right to tell anyone I'm not because I've never experienced the 'struggle' of being anything more than an overweight white boy.

&amp;#x200B;

As I've gotten older, i've become more and more disillusioned with the idea of gender in general, and see myself as just a collection of preferences. Saying something is 'manly' to me is no less a generalization than saying 'white men can't jump'.  When I was a kid I would paint my nails, but didn't really consider that 'girly' until people told me it was. I also have pretty bad social anxiety and I don't really understand how people work, so maybe I'm wrong?

&amp;#x200B;

I just see things on the internet like nb and trans and GNC and cross-dresser and I don't know my own feelings enough to know if any of them apply to me, I just know how I feel. My sex is male and I'm ok with that, but when someone talks about gender I can't really find anything to connect myself to. I'm a mix. Or I'm nothing. Does anyone else feel this way?

She had really beautiful handwriting. It was very flowy and precise and looked like art. I was jealous.

I've always hated my handwriting. It's sloppy and messy and I mostly just make an excuse for it to myself because I tend to write really quickly. Lately however I've been journaling in cursive and some days I don't hate my handwriting as much as I used to. And even when I slip back to non-cursive writing it feels like it's been influenced and so it's not as bad.

So when I jotted down a few lines and she said ""you've got really masculine handwriting"" it just crushed me. I know she didn't mean anything by it and there's no way she could have known how that would have affected me, but oh did it.

I'm now going to look up some tutorials or something to try and work on my handwriting.

It\'s sloppy and messy and I mostly just make an excuse for it to myself because I tend to write really quickly. Lately however I\'ve been journaling in cursive and some days I don\'t hate my handwriting as much as I used to. And even when I slip back to non-cursive writing it feels like it\'s been influenced and so it\'s not as bad.\n\nSo when I jotted down a few lines and she said ""you\'ve got really masculine handwriting"" it just crushed me. I know she didn\'t mean anything by it and there\'s no way she could have known how that would have affected me, but oh did it.\n\nI\'m now going to look up some tutorials or something to try and work on my handwriting.\n\nAnyways, thanks for reading. If anyone wants to share some stories about the little things I\'d love to hear them.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'A date from OKC told me that I had ""masculine"" handwriting and it\'s been bothering me for days.', 'created': 1551831037.0}"

2019-03-06 21:56:11,ay4jk9,2,3,"TL;DR can I take testosterone and Depo-provera at the same time?

(There is talk of menstruation in this post so if that makes you uncomfortable here's your warning)
So at the moment I'm on depo provera, a progestin birth control shot that I get once every 3 months. I'm not taking it for contraceptive purposes, I take it because birth control stops the excruciatingly painful menstrual cramps I would have otherwise (otc pain killers don't have any effect on me) and because this particular form of birth control stops me from menstrating all together which has done a LOT of good for my gender dysphoria, I haven't menstruated in over a year. I really love my birth control.

I plan on starting testosterone soon, and I'm assuming that I'm going to have to stop getting my depo shot once I start T, causing me to start menstruating again untill the T kicks in and stops my periods again (this sounds like actual hell but I know it would be worth it in the long run).

I'm not taking it for contraceptive purposes, I take it because birth control stops the excruciatingly painful menstrual cramps I would have otherwise (otc pain killers don't have any effect on me) and because this particular form of birth control stops me from menstrating all together which has done a LOT of good for my gender dysphoria, I haven't menstruated in over a year.

I'm wondering how you all deal with eating at restaurants, the kind of restaurants where they start every interaction with a gendered title. They'll greet people with 'Good day sir / ma'am', they'll ask you what you'd like to drink using 'sir, what can I pour for you?' and they'll explain the dishes by going by gender 'for the lady, I've got a [description]'. (I'm not a native English speaker so forgive me if the examples sound a bit weird). Basically, anytime the waitstaff comes by your table, they'll address everyone by a gendered title. 

Which is super annoying, because when I go out to eat, I just want to be served my food and not be misgendered. I'm now at the point where I'm actually a bit confused when someone addresses me with 'ma'am', I'm prone to looking around to check they're really talking to me. And it just sort of jolts me out of the pleasant time of enjoying food and drinks, I'm constantly reminded of 'oh crap, people don't even know that nonbinary people exist' etc. 

On the other hand - I don't really know an alternative title that I can provide to the waitstaff. Mx would work in English (I think?), but not in Dutch (what I'm looking for is a title that can also be a proper noun, similar to 'gentleman' or 'lady'. Unfortunately, 'person' also doesn't work grammatically :(). I've looked around on the web for a bit, apparently the whole gender thing is really entrenched in fine dining culture.

2019-03-07 20:12:14,ayh3bp,1,27,"This one‚Äôs a lil long and full of weird coincidences, but it‚Äôs a story about some kindness someone showed me that I really wanted to share. Tl;dr at the end. A few years back, during my undergrad I was just figuring out my sexuality and consequently spent a good amount of class time fawning over people I would never have the courage to talk to. In one of my classes there was a girl who I really didn‚Äôt think much of, but she stuck in my mind. It‚Äôs also important to note that this was one of the first classes I used my chosen name in.  
Anyways, over a year after that class goes by and I was returning from a year abroad and I really wanted to.... chill, so I contacted an old friend and he offered for me to come over and chill with him at his place. We‚Äôre in his room hanging out when his roommate comes home... and guess what! I know her! It‚Äôs the girl from my class over a year ago. I had found out in passing while I was in that class that he knew her but had no idea they were good enough friends to live together. It was a crazy coincidence. Again I didn‚Äôt think much of it.  
Fast foreword 2 years and I‚Äôve graduated and returned as a post bac student in a different (but somewhat related program). I‚Äôve been struggling to get my chosen name to be used exclusively because my official name is still my given name. I want to be more involved, though and I figure if I‚Äôm more involved and people get to know me it‚Äôll stick better, so I attend a club meeting for my major and shocker! She‚Äôs a club leader. Apparently she‚Äôs a senior in the undergraduate major graduating in the spring. I think it‚Äôs hella cool to run into her. They have a lil tour for the building for newer students and even though I‚Äôm not technically new, I‚Äôm not particularly familiar with this end of campus so I attended a tour... and I was the only one there... and she was leading the tour. We got to talking about how we know each other and the class we met in, I‚Äôm surprised she remembers me because it‚Äôs been about 3 years now (wow!) and she says ‚Äúoh! Right don‚Äôt you prefer (chosen name)?‚Äù. I‚Äôm totally taken aback by this. Not only has she not heard my chosen name in three years but she‚Äôs gotten to know me in club meetings as my given name.

TW: this might trigger dysphoria in people with a lot of social dysphoria so if that applies to you please don't read, thanks

Hello :) 

I posted this exact same thing in /r/asktransgender a while ago and got a lot of comments leaning towards one decision but i feel like there was a binary mtf bias there, and like i don't know if I'm strictly binary, plus i didn't say all the things i should have so ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

Anyways

I'm MtF, my dysphoria is 90% physical dysphoria, over my naked body and how clothes fit me, and 9.999% genital dysphoria, specifically the gonads. Gross and untuckable. There's maybe a bit of social dysphoria maybe?

I am on HRT and i feel pretty ok with my transition process. I don't think i can ever pass enough to ever live stealth as a woman though. Which I'd definitely prefer but realistically I'd have to wait more on HRT to see and i really don't think my chances are big if at all there. 

I got way larger than the average shoulders for an adult male (and I'm not an adult yet), i got a terrible brow ridge and lots of minorly masculine features that can't change w hrt that lead to androgynous face at best and i don't have remotely the discipline to actually lose weight enough to shed my denial-bodybuilder-past-self muscles. Plus my tits are growing super far apart, you can easily fit a third one in between and still got plenty of space. And I'm not saying that from a dysphoric perspective, i am not feeling particularly dysphoric as of writing this. I'm just being realistic here. 

That being said, i don't have an interest in being feminine. I like my soft butchy looks, i like being blunt and direct and i honestly feel very very indifferent about my voice. I also like very short but feminine hairstyles and those don't really mask my brow ridge or slanted forehead, so i do look like a feminine boy with that

I mean i can totally tolerate living as the most infinitessimally feminine boy on earth. I don't care what people call me honestly. I'd actually prefer for people to call me a he if they look at me me and see a he. Or a she if they look at me and see a she.

On the other hand, being platonically close and touchy with other women, people not thinking im a pedo if i find their children adorable, people not being freaked out if i touch them, people assuming i actually have a uterus and so on (like oh my god please) being called a woman and so on would make me feel incredibly good. For that i will have to pass pretty well tho. 

What doesn't feel good is thinking that people see me as a man but play along. Or people seeing a man in front of them and telling me that i look ""gorgeous yas queen"" or people feeling like i have failed at transitioning even though i developed masc features and can't do anything about them. 
 
I don't want people to call me a woman if they don't see that in me. I'd seriously be totally ok with people calling me a man if they genuinely see a man in front of them.

I feel like I'd rather accept the horrible damage T has done on me and find a way to be comfortable with the weird inbetweenie wide-ass boy w boobs aesthetic i got

And if in the comimg years i manage to magically pass as cis, well I'd be fucking glad cuz that'll be really really comfortable. 

So i don't really know how these feelings play into a social transition. I'm really confused as to how to proceed with socially transitioning. ",NonBinary,I got next to no social dysphoria.

The thing bothering me about it is that once I woke up, I realized the people in my dream were very naturally interacting with me as 'a person of mysterious and indistinct gender', and I, for lack of a better word, was more comfortably and distinctly nb than I ever am while awake, even with people I'm out to and who use neutral pronouns/name. The situation/dream, on the whole, was anxiogenic (couldn't find keys, my phone kept making noise (that was my alarm), felt bad asking people to help &amp;c), but I was a stressed drunk mess *as* a genderqueer person, not because of it, and felt like I was *being* my gender in the same way that (hopefully for now) only feels like performing when I'm awake.

Not sure if I wrote this looking for advice or what; my feelings are still confused but... I'm happy I guess that my subconscious is starting to really integrate gender comfortably? But it's frustrating that I can't really capture or explain or even quite remember how that feels when I'm awake.

I got involved in an email discussion about the space as I‚Äôm genderqueer myself and someone who was more involved in the organisation thought I could offer some advice. We‚Äôve definitely run into some problems though, the main ones being:
- what if the space just gets used by cis men and women to talk about their gender differences, because no that‚Äôs not what it should be for
- not wanting to exclude people who actually *are* questioning their gender by being too strict on rules
- accidentally outing people by having a physical place that only nbs go into where everyone else can see who goes in and out
- are there even any nbs who would benefit from the space or is it just curious cis people who may mean well but might still complicate things for shy questioning people

On Wednesday the manager calls me into his office and he said he had been doing a lot of research on non-binary people and pronouns and asked how he could be more supportive. He said he would try and figure out if we could change my email, but would change all of the internal office documents to remove my first name.  He put out information about preferred pronouns in the breakroom after asking if the information was accurate and helpful.  He also said he would send an email to my office with my new pronouns and name next week and would look into getting training for my coworkers.

The culture at my job is really bad, and up until recently I wanted to quit, but management's response was so supportive that I want to stay.

i‚Äôm afab, and for most of my life i considered myself cis and went with it. however, for about a year now i‚Äôve been thinking about gender and my identity, and i‚Äôve realized that i don‚Äôt feel connected to my identity as a girl. in fact, i don‚Äôt feel that attached to any gender. i just feel apathetic about gender in general.

i‚Äôve done some thinking about pronouns, and i‚Äôve found that i don‚Äôt have a preference. she, he, they, and even it pronouns work for me. everyone in my life calls me she, which i‚Äôm okay with.    
    
however, to complicate things, it‚Äôs different in another language. i speak french as a second language, and i actually feel way more comfortable using il instead of elle as my pronoun. i haven‚Äôt articulated this to anyone.    
    
i genuinely hate my name, and i‚Äôd really like to change it to a male name.    
    
what makes me doubt that i‚Äôm actually nonbinary is that i don‚Äôt feel all that uncomfortable presenting as my assigned gender. i‚Äôm pretty femme: i wear heavy makeup, and i generally wear cute, feminine clothes. i‚Äôd love to experiment with more masculine clothes, but my parents won‚Äôt let me.    
    
i don‚Äôt know if i‚Äôm experiencing gender dysphoria. i do wish i could look more androgynous, and it would be my dream to have no breasts or hide hips. however, i‚Äôm not certain this is a gender dysphoria issue or a body dysmorphia issue. i‚Äôve struggled on and off with eating disorders since puberty, so it‚Äôs possible that my desire to be slim and flat comes from my disorder rather than dysphoria.    
    
(possible tmi warning)    
i don‚Äôt feel genital dysphoria at the moment, but i‚Äôm also terrified of being pregnant, and the idea of having to use my vagina for sex makes me uncomfortable as well (i am asexual).    
    
what makes me doubt that i‚Äôm nonbinary is that i don‚Äôt feel uncomfortable when people gender me as a girl. i just don‚Äôt care about it that much; i don‚Äôt have very strong opinions on what people call me.

2019-03-11 11:11:44,azs6xk,19,8,"Ehhhhh I don't know why I'm posting here, because everyone here is going to hate me just as much as everyone else does but like...

I'm just sick of binary.

&amp;#x200B;

Like.

This goes against the canon of what I'm supposed to believe, but I don't think anyone is really binary. I don't think gender really means anything. I think that if everyone stopped believing in it, it would go away, and that people *need* to stop believing in it. I ... sort of think of myself as a gender atheist, I guess.

I think ""gender-deconstruction"" used to exist as an idea, but I feel like its been buried, and that if I say this now, people will say I'm discriminating against binary people... but like... that's what I believe.

&amp;#x200B;

I write novels set in worlds where there is no gender construct at all. The characters' bodies - at least their upper bodies - are all visible, but they don't treat each other any differently based on that. They all have long hair and they all wear a lot of jewelry, because long hair and jewelry are as common in their culture as blue jeans are in most real cultures. (I'm... probably going to write it as a comic, to get around the whole pronoun thing in English.)

The characters are all supposed to be attractive, but none of them are attractive in what anyone would call ""feminine"" or ""masculine"" ways. (Except, Westerners would probably think it's all too feminine, because 21st-century Westerners can't even look at the slightest smidge of lace without pulling a weapon on it.)

&amp;#x200B;

My goal in life is to get a day job teaching English, smile and nod and get through work without letting them into my life, and then make my real career writing novels; keep the day job until I get permanent residence, or until the art that I'm living in Tokyo for spreads to other countries and then I'd follow it there; and just... find people who I can relate through by spreading my novels online, and live socially with them, and not be part of ""society"" until some society changes. 

Like... on the surface/mainstream/whatever, Japan may be backwards in regards to a lot of gender-related things, but the art that I like has male characters being soft, and wearing skirts and frills, and just, being tender. They don't call them nonbinary (because the audience doesn't have the vocabulary for it, probably), but they are genderless. (I'm mostly talking about theatre, but there are some things in other media, too).

Basically, Japan does French things better than France in general, but specifically, anything anyone has said that only French women can do, there are Japanese boys that do it better nowadays. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I want ""identifying as nonbinary and doing a more-or-less equal amount of both masculine and feminine things, and not being afraid of looking too-this, or not-this-enough"" to be a cultural shift, and I want that to lead to completely getting rid of the concept of ""too-this, or not-this-enough"".

I don't want ""X"" to be an option for gender, I want IDs and surveys and profiles, etc., to just stop recording gender altogether, because it's not their business and it just reinforces sexism. 

&amp;#x200B;

Identifying as binary doesn't give anyone anything. Being nonbinary means you can do whatever you want. You can do any masculine thing, any feminine thing, and anything that's such a combination of both that binary people can't even imagine it. Being binary is the same as putting yourself in prison. 

That's how I feel, but... other people still think they need it. I know all the reasons they say it's important to them, but I still think they're just hurting themselves. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think that having buckets called ""masculine"" and ""feminine"" adds anything to the ideas, styles, concepts, etc. in those buckets. I think it actually flattens and cheapens those things, and that without the buckets those things would be better off, because they would be allowed to shine for their own merit, and not as just a piece of something.

2019-03-11 19:21:59,azxigk,9,5,"originally i was going to submit this to ask a transgender, but then i realized it was less asking and more rambling, so i deleted it and reposted here.

so: the basics about me. 36 years old, afab, bisexual, think i'm non-binary, definitely NOT cis. my egg started cracking about seven months ago? i'm out online, but irl only my spouse and some close friends know. still working on figuring out the pronoun thing.

almost six weeks ago, i finally got up the courage to do what i've been fantasizing about for 15+ years, even since i knew they were a thing and buy a packer off of amazon. (and yet it took me until last summer to realize i might not be cis...) two days later i was in possession of a small mr limpy and the moment i put it in, i felt RIGHT in a way i wasn't entirely prepared for. like, i wanted to have this dick down my pants  24/7. if you'd have asked me before, i would have said i didn't have bottom dysphoria at all, but i sure have packing *euphoria* all right.

anyway, i've been packing at home for the last month and a bit. it took me a while to find a way i like to pack and also to get some male underwear since at the time mr limpy came, i'd only had girl panties, but i managed to get my hands on a pair of 7packs of boxer briefs with the openings in the front. i've been calling them dick flaps for lack of a better technical term. anyway, i've found that if i stash mr limpy there, turned to the side, he stays where he should and i have the bulge and weight in my pants that i like.

(relatedly, it turns out i love wearing boxer briefs and prefer them to all other underwear. i ended up wearing girl panties again after over a week in boxer briefs and it felt so *weird*.)

anyway. yesterday night was the first time i packed in public and i kind of did it stealthily, since i was at work (retail at a big box store) and i am so very not out at work. they all think i'm a woman and so do our customers. but i wore baggy jeans and asked my spouse to tell me if he could tell i had my dick in and he couldn't. but i *could* and it was nice and reassuring to have it there and i managed to pull it off without getting into trouble. it was a good feeling and i'll probably try it again tonight.

anyway! i've had several personal reactions to all this packing i've been doing and i guess i wanted to check in and see if they're... idk, normal? if they make sense to people? ANYWAY.

**Reaction 1:** internal revision/confirmation of gender. like, i'd come to the conclusion i probably wasn't cis before i got the packer, but ever since i got my cock i've felt a lot *more* sure in my genderqueerness. i think it's because getting the cock has made me really notice the masculine/male parts of me? before i would have said that i'm not always a girl, but now i'm definitely sure that when i'm not a girl i AM a boy.

**Reaction 2:** thinking of my packer as a part of me. this has especially been happening since i finally found the way to pack i feel comfortable with, but i found myself referring to it as 'my junk' in conversation with a friend. and it feels really good to think of it as my genitals now, not just an emotional support penis.

**Reaction 3:** body language. especially sitting. like, granted i've always felt more comfortable and natural sitting with open legs (and i remember as a young teen being critted about taking up too much space and feeling stupid embarrassed) but wearing mr limpy, my legs just spring apart whenever i sit down. before i started packing, i could close my legs and be okay, but now holding them closed tight just feels unnatural. and i've found that more masculine ways of walking and standing *also* feel more natural now. and i think i dig this. 

**Reaction 4:** i really love to touch my dick. like, not even necessarily in a sexual way. it's just so reassuring to reach down and feel that it's there. when i packed in public last night, instead of in private at home, the hardest part (once i figured out i wouldn't be caught and get in trouble) was that i had to mostly leave it alone for six hours. i'm thinking maybe i should get some baggy men's jeans at some point to belt off, since they have such long-ass pockets that i could probably stick my hands in at an angle and brush against where i've got the head, so i can get that reassurance all stealthily. but man. i just super love to touch this dick.

**Reaction 4.5:** all that said, it's like my libido has come back from the war. when i first got my packer, i felt really turned on by it. i was always wet when i had it on. and even though that's died down in the intervening weeks, i *do* feel like a more sexual person than i have for basically years. i feel way more affectionate with my spouse. also, i've started to masturbate a lot more often and more regularly and almost more casually? like i used to have to make it a whole production to get started, but now i just reach down and *do* it. and here's the really crazy thing: i'm doing it by jerking off the packer and i'm actually getting *off* that way. despite it not touching anything. isn't that *wild*?

ANYWAY. i just wanted to check in i guess, see if any of these reactions are things that other people can relate to too. maybe i want some reassurance that this is normal.

I'm enby/femme; but you know, living in anywhere but the most progressive of progressive places, there's only two fucking sex marker options. And you know, here in the US, we have a major fucking problem with transphobia in the gov't.

So of course, when I applied for my Passport the first fucking time, my doctor wrote it ambiguously and I got slapped with a 2 year Passport, albeit with the correct marker, because he wrote in, I think I remember this, as ""continues treatment"" BING! The one fucking buzzword ""CONTINUES"" fucked me right the fuck out of a normal 10 year passport with my correct gender marker. 

And now, when I'm going to redo my passport, I wrote it out, very VERY specifically what happened last time and how the letter needs to be EXACTLY written. The State Department has it VERY SPECIFICALLY written out in a letter WHICH I LINKED TO HIM. He fucked it up, again. He wrote the two most damning words to get my marker changed to F, which would be the safest option for me. Again wrote ""continues"" and ""non-binary"". I fucking hate this world. I fucking hate him right now. It's too fucking late to find someone else. Just fuck.

I'm trying to explain to him through the messaging system at my hospital but you know... It took him like a fucking week this last time to respond and even then only after I sent a second fucking message. 

I wanted to get this done in fucking November but I got really sick, and then I had a move going on; I just simply didn't have the energy and capacity at the time to complete it. And now I'm just fucked. This doctor is working in the specific LGBT portion of the major hospital up here in Cleveland. This isn't like some random dude who probably doesn't know better. 

Oh yea, best of all, the letter wasn't signed. So yea. I can't even submit it.

Just fucking kill me tbh. I haven't decided yet if I get stuck with having to let it lapse or just try and move forward with the letter he sent once I get it signed. I mean, you know, fuck me right? I guess I'm gonna get stuck with a fucking M and just place it on his desk when I see him next and explain how he FUCKED ME OVER.

Oh and, I was born in Louisiana, even if I get my dick whacked off, there's no chance to change my marker on my birth cert. So you know, just fuck me rightly right now. Can I seek asylum in Canada yet? 

I just needed to let off some steam mostly. I know what needs to be done. Contact again, try to get him to write a new letter and sign it this time.

Due to a strict lifestyle I didn't find out I was LGBTQ until I was 19, and I find myself actively gender questioning for the first time at 21. It's been bothering me for quite a while and I've kept ignoring it until now. Trans people go through so much just to exist, and I'm a little afraid I couldn't handle that.

I often don't feel like a girl. I just feel like a person. The constant gendering seems unnecessary; it's tiring to constantly put off the vibe that people expect from cis women. It feels like a chore. I find myself wishing I would find out I was intersex so that I could have a physical reason to be a wide mix of feminine and masculine.

She/her pronouns don't bother me, but I feel like people are missing some of me when they call me a girl. I'm comfortable in my body and don't feel a need to change it. I don't ever feel like a boy, but I do sometimes feel more comfortable if people look at me as a mainly masculine person. This changes day to day. I like to dress in a femme way sometimes, but it irritates me when cis men look at me like I'm a cis woman. I'm unsure if this is because I'm gynesexual and they're barking up the wrong tree, or if irritation is rooted in misgendering.

I'm terrified of what my family would say if it turns out I actually am genderfluid. They don't believe in more than the binary. It may not be worth the trouble of fighting them, but I want to live authentically as myself (whoever that is).

Growing up, I always felt queer. A definitely-not-a-girl kind of person. I wanted to be han solo, and all of my video game avatars were boys. 

In my senior year of high school, I came out as trans. I reluctantly went to a trans therapist. 

I went back in the closet time and time and time again, due to my fear of dying alone. I've always been rejected by family members, with a horrible threat of ""if you're not a good replacement for your siblings (who died) we'll get your mom to put you in foster care so she can try again."" So I guess more than being myself, I want to be loved and accepted for once because I don't really know what that's like. I transferred schools multiple times due to severe bullying, which developed an anxiety disorder. I feel like it's holding me back from pursuing who I really am. It's mentally made me block out how I feel. 

I've been watching transgender story videos all day after stumbling upon a TV show that had a gender queer host. Just crying, and watching intensely.

I'm afraid to take the next step forward. I join support group after support group but I always feel.... Hollow. Different. Like I am so incredibly different.

My dysphoria is getting worse, as is body image. I've started comfort eating and withdrawing from social situations because I'm embarrassed of my body. I feel like a catfish online because I use photographs of me that I don't even recognize anymore-- outdated pictures where I looked beautiful. Even though that's not how I really am.

I want to be recognized as queer, without the expectations of being a trans guy. I just want to be nonbinary. I envy so badly having a body that I feel like is mine. I want the haircut that makes me confident. I want to live life like I'm young instead of hiding away in fear. I limit myself due to my hate of my own body.

When I first transitioned, I was so incredibly happy. It was the consequences that poisoned my heart and now I feel numb.

While he could identify as bi because of attraction to AFAB non-binary people and cis women, he feels uncomfortable doing so due to the social connotation that bisexual people love men and women, which just does not apply to him.

2019-03-17 04:50:18,b21nqr,7,27,"Today was my transgender group meeting, which I have been having a lot of anxiety over due to my dysphoria.

We have a Facebook group, which, on one of my dysphoric days, I posted to about my  reluctantcy to attend group, as being the only nonbinary person to attend the group made me feel like an outcast. 

But this transgender woman saw the post, and messaged me begging me to come tonight, and I did. She smiled at me when she saw me at the meeting. I had an anxiety attack while everyone crowded in and talked and I found myself suffocating under my binder while my hands trembled. She still smiled at me across the room, and it made me feel a bit better.

My friend showed up to the meeting too, and sat beside me which meant a lot, as she hadn't been to the meetings in a while. A nice couple sat next to me, both of which had a calming aura and I eventually calmed down. The group was being especially warm to me, talking about nonbinary resources (without calling me out directly), and how they wanted to let everyone know they accepted nonbinary people (without calling me out) and praised some nonbinary people that they knew. I got teary eyed because I was so happy and touched.

I felt compelled to finally talk about what's been bothering me for months and they were so so supportive and I felt.... Okay. I felt safe for the first time in my skin there in a long time. I felt accepted. And safe.

After the meeting, the girl who begged me to come chased after me as I was leaving and pulled me to the side. She told me she was so incredibly happy that I came and that she wanted to let me know how she never wanted me to feel like I wasn't welcome and that I could always reach out to her. 

I just feel so touched and happy. 

This is the first time in a while I've felt this confident in my gender and have felt acceptance for myself. It feels pretty great. But it feels even better to know that I have friends who care so much about me.

 I have a mental struggle right now.

As a non-disphoric, Cis Hetero, AMAB, with strong genetic physical male features and primal and cultural behaviours (some I try to tame as I know can be toxic);  I feel that gender stereotypes are ridiculous cultural impositions. Painting my nails or wearing a sparkly t-shirt does not make me less of a man or I stop being attracted to women or will make me be attracted to men. At the same time, I do not see a woman less of a woman if she has short or shaved hair, or wants to wear ""not shape forming"" clothes or any other cultural artifacts associated with femininity. For example, my girlfriend does not use make up or jewelry or sparkly shinny things or heels, and I'm no less physically attracted to her as a woman.

At the same time, sometimes I'd like to feel feminine and to do that I reach out to the same gender stereotypes I find ridiculous. Stockings, dresses, earings, manerisms. The more culturally feminine, the better. 

It may be that I started dressing up before the realization of how ridiculous the gender stereotype conditioning is. (I started as a little kid).

Is anyone else struggling with the incongruity?

I don't like myself; I don't like who I am. When I am with other girls, I feel different. When I am with other boys, I feel different. When I tell myself I am nonbinary there are feelings of comfort, but mostly just hatred towards myself. I feel like I am a liar and a fraud, I'm not trans and I'm not nonbinary, and I'm just... wrong. I should capitulate and call myself a woman. But I don't like the idea of that much at all. I am hurting everybody in the trans/nb community because I'm ""not that dysphoric"". If I were actually dysphoric, I would have figured out that something was wrong sooner than this. If I would actually benefit from changing my outward identity, I would feel searing pain at being called a female, called a girl, female pronouns being used--I don't. It's just sort of... the urge to correct them for some reason? I never actually do, because I know that they see me as more poised and pretty and polite because I am a girl. While this isn't exactly accurate, I don't want them to start liking me less. Sometimes I can't tell what's due to dysphoria and what's due to generalized self-hatred.

But then I find myself trying to act more like the males around me. I want to be seen differently. I look in the mirror and I can't say that I like my breasts. When I was younger, I'd always hoped they'd turn out to be small because I didn't want them. Sometimes I wear a sweater that accentuates my boobs and I can handle it, I just don't like it.

I would like to walk on the beach shirtless and in trunks. I never swam much as a kid and I admit that it's mostly because I hated wearing swimsuits (the idea of wearing a bikini? wasn't appealing back then, and now it's unthinkable). I didn't care to... er... shave down there, and while I knew I never would, I didn't want people to think I was some sort of ugly barbarian. I already didn't shave my legs. I didn't give enough of a flying fuck.

I don't really know what to do or what to identify as. For one, I feel like I'm ""fake"" for being okay, perhaps even preferring, to not only be referred to as they/them but also she/her and he/him. I'd like a mixed bag, I guess? That feels most accurate to who I am.

I feel like I am a liar and a fraud, I\'m not trans and I\'m not nonbinary, and I\'m just... wrong. I should capitulate and call myself a woman. But I don\'t like the idea of that much at all. I am hurting everybody in the trans/nb community because I\'m ""not that dysphoric"". If I were actually dysphoric, I would have figured out that something was wrong sooner than this. If I would actually benefit from changing my outward identity, I would feel searing pain at being called a female, called a girl, female pronouns being used--I don\'t. It\'s just sort of... the urge to correct them for some reason? I never actually do, because I know that they see me as more poised and pretty and polite because I am a girl. While this isn\'t exactly accurate, I don\'t want them to start liking me less. Sometimes I can\'t tell what\'s due to dysphoria and what\'s due to generalized self-hatred.\n\nBut then I find myself trying to act more like the males around me. I want to be seen differently. I look in the mirror and I can\'t say that I like my breasts. When I was younger, I\'d always hoped they\'d turn out to be small because I didn\'t want them. Sometimes I wear a sweater that accentuates my boobs and I can handle it, I just don\'t like it.\n\nI would like to walk on the beach shirtless and in trunks. I never swam much as a kid and I admit that it\'s mostly because I hated wearing swimsuits (the idea of wearing a bikini? wasn\'t appealing back then, and now it\'s unthinkable). I didn\'t care to... er... shave down there, and while I knew I never would, I didn\'t want people to think I was some sort of ugly barbarian. I already didn\'t shave my legs. I didn\'t give enough of a flying fuck.\n\nI don\'t really know what to do or what to identify as. For one, I feel like I\'m ""fake"" for being okay, perhaps even preferring, to not only be referred to as they/them but also she/her and he/him. I\'d like a mixed bag, I guess? That feels most accurate to who I am.\n\nAnyway, I must thank you for reading this far.

Some things I‚Äôm worried about are these: 
-if I go on a low dose of T to go slow and hopefully achieve androgyny, I‚Äôm worried my voice will sound helium-y or tinny or crackly forever. This would rly disappoint me as I like my voice and use it to sing 

-I‚Äôm worried that I will change too much in a short period of time and not have the chance to warn/come out to other members of my family besides my immediate. Specifically thinking of my really young siblings who know me as their sister 

-my dad took testosterone supplements for a while due to his low levels and he was very mean and angry during that time. I feel like I‚Äôm similar to my dad in a lot of ways and this is one thing I‚Äôm really scared about

I started experiencing dysphoria around being seen as female around that time, but I didn't know that NB was a thing, so I just assumed I was a guy.

Only thing is, at school, they still use my deadname and old pronouns. I told them to do this. I'm really scared about how people with react if they hear people using other pronouns or calling me by a different name, especially my teachers. I'm just asking for advice on how to come out to people at school. I don't have very many friends, and I don't know a lot of people at my school, but a lot of people know who I am. Wondering if anyone else here is the same boat and has come out to classmates and teachers. Should I tell people just my pronouns at first, then the name later? Or all at once? Or should I just hide for the rest of the school year and come out at the start of school in August? I just need some general advice. The thing I'm most worried about is the name. My new name is kinda on the opposite of the 'gender spectrum' (I hate that names are associated with gender, let me be who I want) than my deadname. Much more femme than my birth name. I'm just super self conscious about how people will react to a masculine looking person being called a 'girl's name'. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

hey ! this is my first ever reddit post so please let me know if i‚Äôve made any mistakes etc so i can fix them!! 

 so i‚Äôm 21, afab enby living in the uk with my partner of almost 3 years. for some background, i‚Äôve known i wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äògirl‚Äô since i was around 14 but only embarassingly recently found the terminology for what i felt. growing up i lived in a small town and didn‚Äôt have much exposure to the queer community (even though i did come out as pansexual while living there, my only real access to lgbtq+ peers was online) and now that i live in london i somehow feel even more isolated than i did then. 

most of my closest friends and family have semi-recently moved far away, and i only ever really see my partner now (because i barely leave the house anymore, yay depression). he‚Äôs very supportive, and is also not ‚Äòcompletely‚Äô cis or straight even though our relationship is cishet-appearing; even so, i feel extremely insecure about how our relationship will be viewed even once i come out to more people. 

 my identity still baffles me daily, as i acknowledge the fluidity but also have always leaned more towards wanting to present ‚Äòmasc‚Äô. lately i have felt more like a gay male hiding within a het-passing relationship, but i don‚Äôt know how to talk about this with my partner. obviously as i lean towards more and more masc then that is more likely to impact us as a unit whenever we leave the house, and i don‚Äôt know how much to emphasise that to him. 
he‚Äôs lovely and gentle and i‚Äôm so in love, but he sometimes would rather say nothing than risk coming off as a ‚Äòshitty man‚Äô by speaking on something he doesn‚Äôt experience. i can‚Äôt bear to hear ‚Äòthat makes sense‚Äô as a response when i‚Äôve just blurted out an essay on how and when i feel dysphoric, or how excited i am by the idea that one day i could save up for top surgery. 

i‚Äôm starting to feel the toll of this as i get increasingly frustrated and repressed within my own home, and i‚Äôve been taking it out on him by snapping at the littlest things and sometimes just being silent for ages at a time. i‚Äôve come out to my mum and several of my close (mostly cis) friends but i feel i have no real queer support network as of right now and am far too anxious to even know how to find one. 

  i hope its okay that i‚Äôm not looking for one super-specific piece of advice, and that this post is kind of a mess, i‚Äôm just feeling very alienated right now and if anything i‚Äôve said resonates with someone then i would really appreciate hearing what they have to say !!

'I glanced down and could tell that HE was wearing women's underwear and what was underneath it'  


Attorneys for a female Pennsylvania high school student filed a federal complaint last week alleging her privacy was violated and that she was subjected to sexual harassment when a transgender student was using the same locker room, WNEP-TV reported.  


\[[link to www.facebook.com (secure)](https://www.godlikeproductions.com/external?https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FAShawLaw%2Fposts%2F990296334499096)\]   


The Honesdale High School incident occurred at the beginning of this school year, according to the complaint filed with the U.S. Department of Education's Civil Rights Division, the station said.  


What allegedly happened?  
Lawyers for the student posted a video online describing what they say happened. The unnamed female student appears in the clip and said ""while I was putting on my pants I heard a man's voice, so I turned around, and he's standing there on the opposite aisle looking at me.

She added: ""When I knew that a man was looking at me, I felt very violated and very scared ‚Äî especially looking at me while I'm getting dressed.""  


Attorney Andrea Shaw added in the video that ""opening up restrooms and locker rooms to members of the opposite sex is sexual harassment. Like most forms of sexual harassment, the girls in this school have little power over their situation. The school's only solution for my client was for her to wait outside the locker room until the individual of the opposite sex was finished changing, and then she went in and was late for gym class and also late for her second period class.""  


""The school's offered solution made it clear that they believed that my client was the problem,"" Shaw also said in the clip.

I will start T in a couple of months time. I feel a bit weird asking online, but in my country non-binary stuff are very new and usually people don't go on low dose, or stop for good, so there isn't much info between the doctors.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm pretty much FTM, I just don't plan any surgery. Despite being short I'm very masculine in body shape, always been very active. I basically want the T changes, like deeper voice, more body hair, bottom growth but I don't want to be on T for life. I don't feel very good about the thought of stopping and getting ""softer"" but I will deal with it. I am ""fine"" with the monthly thing.

I know these listed changes come quite early, my ""plan"" is to be on T for a year or two. Mostly because I'm scared about getting health problems to that specific organ, when I have no intention to remove it. Children are not the reason, I just don't want to go in a hospital.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel a bit lost, I don't know waht would be best for me from the health point of view and I know that the doctor won't know either.

I am wondering if there is any point in going low dose. It literally frustrates me looking at low dose timelines, because I do want the changes to come asap. I am considering it, wondeing if that's actually easier for the body.

2019-03-20 22:35:48,b3ijdb,9,17,"So for 30 years, I've been a girl. I started thinking about this recently, though, sort of looking back on teenagers and teen culture and how these things have changed since I was a part of them. Teenagers tend to grasp for labels with ever-increasing granularity, because that's the time when you're figuring out what sort of adult you're about to be any minute now. When I was a teen, the thing (at least on the internet) seemed to be the presence, or lack thereof, of some greater spiritual being. Are you a deist or a nontheist, or a strong or weak atheist, or a strong or weak agnostic, and so on and so on. Today's equivalent seems to be staking out your place on the spectrum of gender and sexuality. So I asked myself, if I had grown up now instead of in the '90s and early '00s, taking quizzes about what my REAL TRUE gender/sexuality is instead of what flavor of nontheist I am, agonizing about this instead of that, what would I have chosen? Currently, at least until like right now, I've always identified as a straight ciswoman. But it's really more complicated than that, as soon as I start to think about it more than not at all. 

I have no interest in other women sexually, but I've had a close nigh-romantic friendship with one for the last 15 years. Like, we are partners in basically every way that matters and sometimes I want to hold her hand and bring her flowers, but she doesn't like handholding or flowers so we don't do that. I have romantic and sexual feelings about men, and I have a definitely masculine boyfriend that I love and fuck. So I guess that's biromantic heterosexual, which is near enough to ""straight"" that there's really no functional difference for me, since I'm someone who prefers the sex come with romance every time. Easy enough, there's that identity sorted.

As far as gender goes, I really didn't ""get"" transpeople at all for a long time. I've always been supportive nonetheless, because as a ciswoman, obviously I wouldn't ""get"" it, would I? I have the pretty normal childhood story of being tomboyish but not athletic, liking nerd shit that's ""boy things"", having no interest in normal ""girl things"" like dolls and makeup. Any pride I had in being a girl was that cringey-in-retrospect ""not like other girls"" kind of thing. I've never experienced wanting to be a boy, just frustration when people have tried to criticize me for being not feminine enough, or for liking ""boy things"". I didn't get why a person wouldn't just be a masculine woman or a feminine man. After all, I'm a girl and I can wear whatever I want, so why can't a dude wear a dress? I didn't get why I didn't ""get"" it until I saw Vihart's On Gender video a few years ago. Oh, I just don't relate because I don't have strong feelings about being a girl. Or any feelings, literally at all. If I woke up tomorrow and I were physically male, the only feeling I would have would be annoyed at the inconvenience of my clothes not fitting. I don't have euphoria, or dysphoria, or anything, I just nothing the idea. I'm a girl essentially by default. So if I were a teen now, I'd probably identify as nonbinary. 

BUT WAIT A MINUTE. This thought experiment is about how I would identify if I were hypothetically growing up now, but it's based on things that are literally true. I would hypothetically identify as nonbinary because the definition applies to me... which makes me nonbinary, literally actually now. 

The problem, I guess, is that I don't know what to do with this information, if anything. I don't care what pronouns people use for me. I like my clothes. I'm fine with my body. This would have no impact on my friendships or relationships or work or anything at all, unless I decided to enforce they/them, which just seems like so much work for something I don't care about. 

So what do you guys think? Is there any reason for me to ""come out""? Feel free to lay the smackdown on me if I'm internalizing any transphobic nonsense here, I'm a grownup and I can take it.

After speaking with my therapist last night, we both agreed that I need to start seriously exploring my gender identity and sexuality in a less traditional way. I'm in my late 20's and living in the Midwest, so there's isn't exactly a flourishing community of nonbinary folks to talk to, so I figured this would be a good place to start. ^(Ok so there are a few places but I'm a socially anxious turdwagon and I need to ease into this.)

I was in intense EMDR therapy for most of last year to figure out some childhood trauma, and while I'm largely done with that work, I'm still having issues with my sexuality and gender. My trauma involved an element of sexual abuse, and while I know my sexual dysfunction partially stems from that, I wonder if some of it stems from my gender identity and sexual gender roll.

SO. I'm very curious about everybody else in here. **In terms of having sex, how does your gender identity play a role? Do you find yourself adhering to any certain roles more than others?

I'm a 20 year old nonbinary person now, but I used to be an oblivious little kid who didn't know anything about the world at all (even compared to other kids my age).
I was sitting with a teacher during indoor recess in kindergarten. I don't remember why this conversation was happening or how it started, but we were talking about colors.
""There are boy colors and girl colors."" I am paraphrasing, of course. I do not remember word for word what I had said so long ago. 
""Which colors are boy colors and which are girl colors?"" My teacher asked. 
I listed them off. Boys got blue and green and orange. Girls got pink and red and yellow.
""What about Noah?"" My teacher nodded towards another kid who was playing nearby. "" He's wearing red, but he's a boy."" 
A shook my head like what she said was silly. ""Boys can wear girl colors and girls can wear boy colors,"" I said. 
""Why?""
""Because they're just colors.""
""Then why are some for boys and some for girls?""
""They just are!""
""Why?"" 
""I don't know."" 
I don't think my kindergarten teacher was trying to make me tear apart and dissect the societal constructs of gender roles and expectations. I don't live in an area with many people (especially of the older generations) who think that way, plus I was in kindergarten, hanging out with a teacher instead of friends. I was barely social yet, let alone aware of social constructs. But I remember feeling really odd as a little kid, despite forgetting the whole conversation a few minutes later, not to resurface until I was much, much older. 
Not sure what the point of this was. Just thought I'd share. Kids are learning the world. In some ways, they understand it better than any adult does. They see what is there in front of them instead of what others want us to. I try to look at society through the lens of a child when I can. It helps you realize how many ""controversial"" things are founded on nonsense, or on some abstract form of power. All I care about is how I feel in my own skin, how I can make others feel, and how much good I can out into the world.

2019-03-23 00:44:56,b4cv2c,12,7,"Okay, so I've had a few questions about non-binary identity for a while now so wanted some concrete answers because I'm interested in learning. If anything I say is insensitive please realise I'm just making attempt understand. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is the expectation from non-binary that one day all people would become non-binary? Or do they think that it's just another gender in addition to man and woman? (the latter would what I'm inclined to think)
2. I can't imagine dating a non-binary person that had been born a man (I'm a hetero man). I can only imagine finding  those born as a woman attractive and even then they'd have to have a reasonable amount of traditional ''feminine'' traits. Does this make sense? Or is this seen as insensitive?

I say thee things as a hetero man that feels in touch with their feminine side but still displays a large amount of the masculine.

First, I'm AFAB. My sex is female. But I have trouble understanding what exactly being a ""girl"" (or boy) is supposed to mean. I understand biological sex, but gender seems so subjective to me.

Thinking about it more, I don't really care? I don't mind being called male or female or doorknob. I'm not like an object of course, but I'm just a human. However I look on the outside has never really been a big thing to me.

Male, female, or both, I am a human. That's what's most important. Perceive me/call me however you like, but don't let that keep you from getting to know me as a being. Gender shouldn't be a limiting thing in any sense.

There are times where I feel more masculine or feminine, and I feel like calling myself ""male"" or ""female"" but I don't strongly identify with either. Maybe both sometimes, but not either or.

I'm just me. I want to call myself *something* so that there's a word to this feeling, but I don't want to *label* myself as something, if that makes sense. I'm just a being.

I've been transitioning for a bit over two years now, and have completed top surgery and am on the wait list for bottom surgery.

Now I'm on a female swing, and stuck with a dual binary - my social identity at one end of the spectrum, and my physical identity is at the other.

In the past when I was stuck with both present I would be dysphoric. I think part of the issue is that I was holding back, trying to mix it up to keep both sides happy. In early January I decided to quit doing that; whatever I am socially at the moment, I'm entirely committed.

I just need to rant a little. I‚Äôve identified as nonbinary for about a year now, and have slowly been exploring the options of medically transitioning. I‚Äôm interested in going on a low does of T and potentially getting top surgery. I‚Äôve been reading tons of stories and watching videos about people who‚Äôve gone on T and/or had top surgery and I connect to those people so much. 

At this point I just feel stuck, and torn between who people have seen me as and how I see myself. I‚Äôm jealous of people who feel more comfortable and can present physically in a way that is more true to their gender. But I also feel doubts (that I think a lot of us experience and some binary trans people reinforce) of not being ‚Äòtrans‚Äô enough, and that I‚Äôm wrong and just going to be stuck feeling like this forever. 

I got to visit a super queer and diverse sex shop. It was so cool! They had a ton of gender-affirming toys and prosthetics. It made me really happy, but then sad, feeling like I would never get to where I want to be. I read a short zine about someone who had started T and felt so affirmed in their body.

2019-03-24 00:30:08,b4q9cc,9,5,"Hey love! Welcome to my world of loneliness-driven, existential dread. :)

*I want to preface by saying that, although it is not my intention, the content in this post maayyy trigger dysphoria. I also want to say that a lot of the ideas/topics I discuss here are definitely already known/understood by at least one other person out there. I'm not trying to be all deep or whatever, but these are my thoughts (or conclusions I've drawn based on my own personal life experience), and you have the freedom to take, entertain, or leave them as you see fit. I am also a very long-winded word-y being, (perhaps unnecessary so, aha) so if you aren't into that, I've left a TD;LR. I also use I a lot because, again, I'm spreading from my own personal experience. But I know how annoying that can be so I apologize in advance*

Alright so, we don't (yet) fully understand what consciousness is, but hear me out.

Currently, I identify as Agender. To me, my consciousness (the awareness that I am alive, my thoughts, ect) is, for the most part, what I view to be ""me"". It is a self-awareness that is separate from my physical form. I suppose my brain is AG, physically speaking, because that is the sex that I was assigned at birth. But my thoughts aren't AG thoughts, are they? AG thinking process maybe, but not AG thoughts.

Thoughts and emotions are not all that we are yes, but neither is our physical form, whatever that form may be.

Personally, I see my body as a vessel for interacting with the world. It's still important to me, because without it I would lose my ability to be conscious and experience life. But it does not, on it's own, encapsulate who I am to myself, or to anyone else.

That being said, our physical forms still affect how we perceive ourselves. For example, Trans people (Hey! :) ) exist because they have an observable *physical* brain structure that does not match with their physical sex. I am not Trans, nor do I experience physical dysphoria, but I'm sure that one can imagine how uncomfortable this must be for them. I know that would be almost unbearable for me to feel forever trapped in a body that does not feel like it belongs to me.

I've spent a good long while trying to figure out what I am, and how I want to present myself outwardly to others. But I realized that, *who* you are may be more important. Your actions and presence say more about you than any article of clothing or outward appearance. 

I do not have all the answers. Heck, I may not have any. But what I know is that you are alive. I am alive. One day, we won't be. But for now, we are all connected in the sense that we are all experiencing what it is to exist in this world, as a human being. And guess what babe?

*You are the only person in this world to exist, right now, exactly as you are.*

TL;DR: Whoever you are, you're pretty cool.

I generally present in a masc of center way, but don't necessarily want to fully present as male. I currently wear a binder most of the time, but that can only do so much, and I want to feel better on the clothes that I choose.

The tricky part about getting full top surgery is that both my wife and my mum don't want me to get it, I don't know if it's something that I want but it's hard to get a clear picture of what I want because I'm also worried about upsetting them.

On the one hand, a reduction would give me more freedom to choose to presently more feminine if I feel like it. It would also be less to get me head around - I don't know if would still feel like me with no boobs at all. Another 'for' in the reduction column is that I have an hourglass figure and might look unbalanced with nothing up top.

On the other hand, reductions can only go so small (like a D/C at most), so I would still be binding most of the time to feel comfortable in my clothes. And if I'm doing that, why not go for full top so I don't have to wear a binder or bra at all?

Hello,

I see Dr. Kathy Rumer for a surgical consultation soon, and I'm really afraid to tell people this...

Basically, I identify as non-binary. I am AMAB, but I present as a man, wear men's clothing, etc.

But, like, my genitalia really bother me, alot. Also, I often fantasize what it would be like to have a vagina and to have sex with it. I have a boyfriend and I've told him, and he's perfectly cool with it, but I'm afraid like that I won't be able to get this procedure. If I do get a vaginoplasty, I plan to go on testosterone after. I guess I just look at trans men all the time and wish I was them...

Does anyone here have similar feelings to mine? I don't have a desire to feminize, I just want a vagina. I'm not sure what I should even say to Dr. Rumer about my desire. Also, has anyone ever seen her before?",NonBinary,Non-Binary Vaginoplasty?,1553517095.0,"{'created_utc': 1553491895, 'id': 'b56oym', 'num_comments': 5, 'score': 18, 'selftext': "" \n\nHello,\n\nI see Dr. Kathy Rumer for a surgical consultation soon, and I'm really afraid to tell people this...\n\nBasically, I identify as non-binary.

Hi folks, yet-unnamed afab nb (masc of centre) child here. I've been trying to choose a new name, since my birth name is heavily gendered and has some rather unfortunate associations for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I've narrowed it down from a list of about 100 to 20 to a shortlist of 4 and I'm now really struggling to choose between them, so I thought I'd get some advice from you folks!

&amp;#x200B;

So far my list is as follows: Elis, Linden, Robin, and Elian (seems like I really have a thing for those -n names eh...)

&amp;#x200B;

Some of my scattered thoughts:

* Linden is a lovely name except I'm from Vancouver and Trevor Linden is one of our super respected and famous hockey players, and I don't really want people to make that association
* Robin is great fun to write since my capital R is the best-looking letter in my handwriting
* Elis with one l? Ellis with two? who knows, language is fake
* Elian kinda sounds like hellion the way I intuitively pronounce it, not sure how many people would make that connection buuut I'm thinking of playing around with the pronunciation just because of that

&amp;#x200B;

Hey, guys, gals &amp; nonbinary pals! Derry here, the DM of the Dice Will Roll podcast, here with a new episode of our show! We're a group of 4 LGBT friends- an Irish Pan Animator, a Trans Latino Artist, an Enby Californian Theater Kid and a Filipino Bi Graphic Designer, who've been friends for years and playing DnD for a lot of that time- specifically, Pathfinder, a spinoff system with expanded options and rules! When the Playtest for a Second Edition of Pathfinder was announced for the system, we couldn't help but jump right into a brand new campaign and test out the rules. And what better way to start us off than the legendary KINGMAKER campaign, a sprawling adventure through the wilds with the goal of raising a kingdom run by the players! So legendary, in fact, it's inspired a video game, which has an amazing soundtrack including pieces by Inon Zur of Dragon Age- featured in our show, with permission from the Devs! Without further ado, we hope you enjoy the show! If you do, make sure to tell a friend, leave an iTunes Review, subscribe to our feed or support us on Patreon! And just to get you hooked, here's a teaser for our latest episode: Fables &amp; Fey!

*Our explorers of the Stolen Lands are on the hunt: they're looking for the monstrous Tatzylwyrm, a snake-like dragon which is rumoured to lurk along the rivers of the Greenbelt! However, as per usual, stuff gets in the way- some tricksters toy with them, they tell each other their pasts, and become closer as friends! But can the power of friendship prepare them for the ghastly discovery that waits in the clearing..? Who's to say? Maybe it will, maybe it won't! It all depends on how the dice roll!*

*Stories get woven. Monsters get hunted. Dread creeps through souls. All this and more in this episode of ¬†Dice Will Roll, the Gayest Pathfinder Podcast on the Planet, where we ask the hard questions like... how do I get these annoying invisible pranksters to leave me alone?*

ramble about gender because sometimes I get a bit insecure about being an Enby :) so grab a drink and pull up your pants because you can't push up pants.

*This is just my take on things, you don't have to agree, regardless I'm up for civil discussion on this, because I love hearing other people's perspectives.*

Anyways, you are not your gender.

Yes, you have a biological sex, (male or female).

Yes, you have an assigned gender based on that biological sex, (man or woman).

Yes, you have a balance of hormones in your body that affect your thought processes and physical appearance (testosterone and estrogen).

But none of those matter when it comes to *gender Identity/Expression*

Your assigned gender is there. Your sex is there. But you do not have to accept or deny either.

If you do not connect with your body, if you do not connect with words used to address you socially, if you mentally do not connect to your assigned gender, or if you are like me do not understand ""gender"" in general, that is okay. If you identify as NB for another reason, that's cool too. I feel like it's a lot more normal than a lot of people admit. So long as there is nothing harming you, and that you are getting help for unpleasant feelings associated with dysphoria, or unpleasant feelings in general, you, as a human, have the freedom to express your gender (or lack of connection to said gender) however you wish. 

I'm tired of people being unnecessarily rude or even hateful because they are confused/frustrated that they cannot understand that we do not identify as ""Man"" or ""Woman"" or ""Boy"" or ""Girl"".

I am not rejecting my gender. I'm not replacing it with a different wacky new ""third gender"". I am *expressing* (Through language, physical appearance, mannerisms, ect) that I feel no strong connection to my assigned gender, that I have no desire to connect with my assigned gender, and that living this way is way helps me somewhat soothe the conflict between my mind and body.

*However you identify, like everyone else, you're still a human who deserves politeness and a fair amount of basic respect. We are all multi-dimensional beings, and despite what some people would say, not any amount of words that will sum up the entirety of who we are*

What determines who we are is our actions and character. That's it. You keep doing you.

2019-03-27 03:53:24,b5zoa0,6,40,"So, I‚Äôve never actually looked up what the clinical definition of gender dysphoria is or what symptoms qualify someone for a diagnosis.

But since truscum like to use the concept as a basis for whether they offer basic respect to someone or not, I was inspired by some conversation in /r/ennn to do a little reading. This post is basically what I commented over there with more added at the end.

The DSM-5 lists six symptoms of gender dysphoria and at least **two** must be met for diagnosis *and* it must cause ‚Äúclinically significant distress or impairment.‚Äù 

**Three symptoms involve a desire or feeling of being a gender or to be treated like a gender other than one‚Äôs assigned gender without any mention of how the person feels about their sex characteristics.** So the experience of gender dysphoria does not necessarily have to have anything to do with body parts.

As for the clinically significant bit, well, I have an anecdote.

When I was nervous about diagnostic testing for ADHD, my therapist basically told me **a diagnosis is just a tool for treatment. Not meeting the criteria for a diagnosis doesn‚Äôt make your issues less real or mean you‚Äôve been faking whatever caused you to seek a diagnosis in the first place. It doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt still seek to solve whatever those issues are.**

The concept/diagnosis of gender dysphoria is primarily a tool used to treat patients who are suffering, whose lives are being significantly disrupted, whose quality of life can improve through treatment. 

The absence of clinically significant gender dysphoria doesn‚Äôt suddenly invalidate a trans person‚Äôs transness or give people license to misgender anyone. It doesn‚Äôt make anyone‚Äôs identity less real. 

It means that their needs for living and functioning as their gender can probably be met without professional/medical intervention.

**A diagnosis is not an identity**. It might help someone clarify or work out their identity, it might play a huge role in someone‚Äôs identity, it might help shape how someone relates to themselves and to the world, but it‚Äôs not a definition of a person.

[The APA itself](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria) when explaining the treatment for gender dysphoria, acknowledges that adults may only need support in being treated as their gender without additional medical treatment or altering their bodies. 

**The APA actually broadly defines gender dysphoria as discontent with one‚Äôs AGAB and says that it‚Äôs just more specifically defined when using it as a diagnostic tool.**

While I don‚Äôt think any of this is going to convince any truscum to suddenly start accepting us or any trans identified person who doesn‚Äôt experience physical related dysphoria (and I want to acknowledge that not all of us are even comfortable self identifying as trans and that‚Äôs okay, I hope this post still has helpful info for you or at least arms you to better support the people who do) but I know I felt some validation looking into all this and wanted to share.

a friend and i decided to visit one of the science museums in my city and check out an exhibit she‚Äôs been interested in. it seemed like a bad time, since the museum is known as a popular destination for kids and families and my state‚Äôs schools (meaning our university and most public schools) are on spring break this week. still, we decided the brave the masses of children to find something to do on a wednesday afternoon.

in the time that we were there several kids came up to me and explained things to me or asked me to help out, which i‚Äôm used to‚Äî i work with kids often enough that i knew what to do. at one point as my friend and i were looking at one of the experiments they had out, though, i heard a quite voice behind me go, ‚Äúexcuse me, miss?‚Äù

i turned around (even though i don‚Äôt normally respond to miss?) to see a kid who looked to be about middle school age, who immediately asked, ‚Äúwhat does your they/them pin mean?‚Äù

i was carrying the backpack i use at school today. it has several enamel pins on the inner part and a large-ish pin with my pronouns (as shown in the link above). i do this so that other folks can see it and hopefully they‚Äôll address me correctly. my school my home city are pretty inclusive, so i feel comfortable doing this. 

i was a little surprised but was able to explain that it means that i want people to use they/them as pronouns when they refer to me. as i was about to explain further i saw this kid‚Äôs face light up and they immediately declared, ‚Äúi use they/them pronouns too! it‚Äôs so cool to find one of my people!‚Äù

they asked to take a selfie with me (i said yes, of course, and i‚Äôm sure it was cheesy and terrible) then went on their way. it was really nice and cool to see a younger teen so proud of their identity, and to be that kind of older, probably more ‚Äúout‚Äù type of person that i was always excited to meet. idk if they‚Äôre on here at all, but if they are i hope they see it and hope they had a good day at the museum!",NonBinary,a kid stopped me to ask what the button on my bag meant.,1553763296.0,"{'created_utc': 1553738096, 'id': 'b6cz5y', 'num_comments': 5, 'score': 27, 'selftext': 'here‚Äôs a [link](https://m.imgur.com/a/sWHxBlt) to a pic of my button, on my backpack. apologies for this being a link and for any other weirdness because of mobile. \n\nanyways. \n\na friend and i decided to visit one of the science museums in my city and check out an exhibit she‚Äôs been interested in. it seemed like a bad time, since the museum is known as a popular destination for kids and families and my state‚Äôs schools (meaning our university and most public schools) are on spring break this week. still, we decided the brave the masses of children to find something to do on a wednesday afternoon.\n\nin the time that we were there several kids came up to me and explained things to me or asked me to help out, which i‚Äôm used to‚Äî i work with kids often enough that i knew what to do. at one point as my friend and i were looking at one of the experiments they had out, though, i heard a quite voice behind me go, ‚Äúexcuse me, miss?‚Äù\n\ni turned around (even though i don‚Äôt normally respond to miss?) to see a kid who looked to be about middle school age, who immediately asked, ‚Äúwhat does your they/them pin mean?‚Äù\n\ni was carrying the backpack i use at school today. it has several enamel pins on the inner part and a large-ish pin with my pronouns (as shown in the link above). i do this so that other folks can see it and hopefully they‚Äôll address me correctly. my school my home city are pretty inclusive, so i feel comfortable doing this. \n\ni was a little surprised but was able to explain that it means that i want people to use they/them as pronouns when they refer to me. as i was about to explain further i saw this kid‚Äôs face light up and they immediately declared, ‚Äúi use they/them pronouns too! it‚Äôs so cool to find one of my people!‚Äù \n\nwe didn‚Äôt talk for very long, but they ended up telling me that they were in junior high (i tried to make it clear that i‚Äôm 20 and an actual adult so that they didn‚Äôt try to be friends more than that), that they had come out to their grandfather who seemed accepting, and that their father thought the nonbinary flag was for a school club or something. they seemed excited when i confirmed that i identify as nonbinary, too. \n\nthey asked to take a selfie with me (i said yes, of course, and i‚Äôm sure it was cheesy and terrible) then went on their way. it was really nice and cool to see a younger teen so proud of their identity, and to be that kind of older, probably more ‚Äúout‚Äù type of person that i was always excited to meet. idk if they‚Äôre on here at all, but if they are i hope they see it and hope they had a good day at the museum!', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'a kid stopped me to ask what the button on my bag meant.', 'created': 1553763296.0}"

2019-03-28 08:30:46,b6g8zv,6,1," Hi, I realized I was NB about 7 years ago. I started hrt (testosterone at full male dose) about 4-5 years ago, then stopped because I realized it was starting to cause dysphoria the other way. Now even off of it, it seems I still look like a normal guy to most people. I haven't tried completely removing my facial hair, but I'm kind of also worried about trying it because I think being perceived as a cisgirl would cause more dysphoria than being percieved as a cisguy (possibly because I default towards the masculine side or maybe just because my birth sex is female so it feels more one-sided). 

 At any rate, normal female and normal male ranges of estrogen/testosterone both cause dysphoria for me for various reasons. I'm thinking about trying a combination of blocker and low hormone dose or maybe not blocking estrogen completey but trying to lower it. Considering how masculine I apparently look off T, I'm now also worried that won't solve it and I may not even want to try it. It seems in terms of physical ambiguity, just going back to no hrt/no blockers may be the closest I can get. However, that is still causing my a great amount of dsyphoria regularly.

I heard a poem from the teacher at the assembly today. 
All about how our electronics and smart devices are making us detached from being human, from feeling human.
‚ÄúWhere sweet private whispers become public.‚Äù
And it makes me think back. Back to the weekend I spent with my partner.
A weekend of amazing food and tea that I haven‚Äôt had before.
Of going to shows at their school and being caught up in the energy.
And every time we went out of the house, they dressed me up in another outfit.
And I felt amazing.
I felt my true self come out in those outfits.
The crop tops, the boyfriend jeans, the makeup, and a David Bowie lightning bolt that they drew on my face.
And I loved every second of it.
And I thought to myself, 
‚ÄúIs this what it‚Äôs like to feel human?‚Äù
And during the intermission and after the show, they introduced me to their friends, and they welcomed me with open arms, despite the fact that I don‚Äôt go to the same school. 
I felt legitimate gender euphoria, where all the bad thoughts could just fade away, and I could be my natural feminine self.
And I thought to myself,
‚ÄúIs this what it‚Äôs like to feel human?‚Äù
And when we got back to their house, and we snuggled up together on the sofa and watched Queer Eye or She-Ra all blown up on the big TV, and I felt as if I could die right then and there, and I would still be happy. 
And I thought to myself,
‚ÄúIs this what it‚Äôs like to feel human?‚Äù
And after a fairly big dinner, we stepped into a bubble bath full of rose petals, and they held me in between their legs as we washed with a special soap from Lush shaped like a heart, and everything felt so ethereal and full of love, and I asked myself,
‚ÄúIs this what it‚Äôs like to feel human?‚Äù
And by the time we were dry at midnight, and their parents had gone to sleep, and we went into their bed. 
And we cuddled.
They held my legs in theirs, and they pressed my body close to theirs, and they left a warm, passionate kiss on my forehead.
I kissed back, and then we were united. 
I could almost see myself outside my own body.
Two beings, lovers, intertwined, stripped of clothes and garments, pressed together into one. I felt peace. I felt at home. 
I felt my body fade and melt away, and I was only an essence, being held like a koala against the warm figure of my partner. 
I faded into pure love then, and everything was clouded under metaphysical pinks and blues. 
They brought me back into reality, touching and caressing me.
They brought my body into theirs, and they made me to use their chest as a pillow. 
And although they told me about wanting a reduction, they enjoyed the moments we had, and how we made each other happy.
I was in bliss.
We cuddled like koalas until we fell asleep, our phones only distant whispers.

Confusing right?

Example:
Man speaking to female dog: 'who's a good girl? Yes you are. Yes dad,yes. So cute. Come sit with your dad. '
Man speaking to male dog: 'who's a good boy? Yes you are. Yes dad,yes. So cute. Come sit with your dad. '

Woman speaking to female dog: ''who's a good girl? Yes you are. Yes mom,yes. So cute. Come sit with your mom. '
Woman speaking to male dog: ''who's a good mom? Yes you are. Yes mom,yes. So cute. Come sit with your mom. '

It sounds so weird in english. But we literally speak for the dogs to ourselves.

Everyone does this. It's normal. I swear. 

I was talking for/to my dog the other night and just got hit in the face with a wave of dysphoria.

I've been questioning my gender (again) recently. I first started as cis female years ago, then I went through a bunch of nonbinary identities, and then I thought I was a trans male for like 2 years. Spoiler alert, I wasn't. I found that out when my mental health deteriorated veeeery quickly IDing as a guy.

Since then, I went back to cis female. I hated everything masculine. I'd cry if I thought I looked even remotely not-feminine, I remember one day having a bit of a breakdown in school because I walked down the stairs in a way I didn't think was feminine. I've since relaxed ofc but now I'm questioning again.

Woman and lady and other female terms don't feel right. I'm okay with girl, but only from my boyfriend. It's weird, I know, and it seems like every term you could call me has an asterisk at the end, and then a 10 page list of exceptions. Woman and lady universally do not feel NiceTM though. Female doesn't either, unless it's strictly in a biological sense, since I am AFAB.

Problem is, I'm okay with she/her. I have absolutely no problem with it. I'm also very happy with they/them. I wouldn't say I prefer one over the other, but right now I'm using they/them online and she/her irl and it's a nice balance. I feel like both she/her and they/them combined capture my identity and personal sense of being very well. What my exact identity is, I'm not sure, but yeah.

&amp;#x200B;

Hey all,

&amp;#x200B;

I've been lurking for a few months now, and I am really happy to finally make this post. Seeing so much support from this sub has made me feel so much braver. After many years of questioning and fear, I've finally accepted that I'm almost certainly agender, and that nonbinary feels right to me.

I have the classic story of growing up a tomboy, although as I entered middle school I became more comfortable with femininity. Then, in my freshman year, I was blindsided by the desire to cut my hair and present highly masculine. During that time, I went by he/him online but never came out to anyone. I also lost most of my friends that year, and after it ended, I mistakenly thought it was because of my gender expression and began to dress more femininely again. I entered a toxic and harmful relationship for my sophomore and junior years, where I grew my hair long and acted exclusively feminine for that period of time at his request. He told me near the end that if I cut my hair again, no one would ever love me or think I was attractive, and that I would never be androgynous no matter what I do. In the moment, it seemed terrifying, but I cut my hair despite what he said and finally managed to escape from that relationship. Also, jokes on him, because I realized his words were just a last-ditch effort and weren't actually true! (androgyny ftw whip and dab)

I spent the summer after junior year healing, chilling, and getting back into presenting how I want to. In the fall of my senior year, I met my current datefriend and the most wonderful person I know. After not having close friends since the start of high school, they introduced me to their group of very gay and very good friends, and we've helped each other both explore our gender identities. The rest of senior year up till now has been filled with a lot of reflection, support, and happiness from the little community that seemed to spring up around me overnight last fall.

This sub has also worked wonders for my anxieties about gender that have kind of been looming over me my whole life, as I look back. I've done a lot of thinking, and the fact that I could always visit this sub for some positivity has been incredible. (Basically, if you've posted in this sub for the last like several months, I definitely saw your post/selfie and loved it!!!) Especially amid a lot of the truscum/transmed conversations on social media, a lot of the time I began to feel confused and invalid. This sub has always been there in those moments, and helped me realize I can be as masculine, feminine, or androgynous as I like! With all you folks' help, I've finally accepted that nonbinary fits me. Additionally, agender also feels right, as some of the things I learned from my self-reflection included that I think of myself moreso as an entity than a girl (I know that description could apply to other identities but agender seems to sum it up well for me).

There's a lot more work for me to do as I learn about my identity, but I wanted to share my story and thank you all so so much for everything you've done for me. Oh jeez this is emotional huh. I'm definitely not crying right now for sure. With your support, I came out to my small group of friends, which isn't much, but it's a start. Thank you for providing such a supportive and accepting space, because you've given me the gift of a place I could explore who I am without judgement. Happy TDOV.

One big doubt i have is what makes someone non-binary? Is it something each person defines or are there strict rules?  For example, if a cis man does feminine things, is he non binary or just a cis man who is feminine?

2019-03-31 23:11:25,b7u48z,7,3,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm new to this subreddit, and I guess I have a question or maybe to vent. Really any advice would be nice.

&amp;#x200B;

I have identified as nonbinary for about three years and I have been coming out to more people slowly but surely. I was recently accepted into a graduate position in the conservation science field. This field is typically male-dominated but I'm working closely with three seemingly ""liberal"" females. I am not very close to my new advisor yet and we haven't had much time to talk just the two of us, so I am not sure where she stands on some things.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, at the heart of the matter I use they/them pronouns but I accept she/her. For my official grad student bio I purposely used they/them pronouns as it felt more comfortable and was a huge step for me. Of course I submitted this without expressly stating this to my advisor. I found out today that she updated her website to add me in, but my bio was changed to she/her pronouns. 

&amp;#x200B;

I probably wouldn't feel so upset had I not made the purposeful decision to use my preferred pronouns and they were changed without anyone asking me. Like I said, I don't necessarily mind she/her but I didn't write my bio with them. 

&amp;#x200B;

My next meeting with my advisor is in two weeks with another cohort member and a member from an environmental agency who is a mentor on this project. Do I address this issue with all of them at this meeting? Do I send my advisor an email or wait for some time alone? Or do I just deal with it since I do accept she/her pronouns?

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice/opinions/anything would help. I'm just sad today.

&amp;#x200B;
