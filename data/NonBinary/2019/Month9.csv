i’m applying to a few all girls liberal arts schools that i’m really interested in (smith and wellesley), the environment seems perfect for me and i love the idea of learning and living in the absence of cis males. i am worried about questioning my gender and possibly realizing that i’m non-binary while im going to college. 

has anyone had experience with that? should i be concerned about applying there? i really like the schools, but im just not sure how my experience there might be if i figure out my gender identity

2019-09-01 01:30:33,cy3xgz,2,16,"Two words: Walmart clearance.

So today I went to Walmart and I ended up purchasing, between other random feminine clothing items, two tank tops, and only upon cashing at self-checkout did I realize that one came from the girls' section and the other from the boys' section, which at least explained why the tags said they were different sizes but I could clearly see with my own eyes that they were about the same size. I'm 16 and on the smaller side, so I fairly often fit 10-12 size shirts. It was only when I got home and tried on all of these clothes did I get to the two tank tops: a green one from the boys' section and a yellow one from the girls'. 

Upon trying on the girls' tank top, I noticed it fits about as expected and still finds my curves in the way that clothing geared towards female-bodied people does. The green tank has a different neckline and slightly different cut that I could notice and I preferred how that one fit, which makes me wonder if it's just the idea that it is supposed to be a masculine piece of clothing that intrigues me or if I genuinely thought it looks better on me. I feel like it's a combination of both. Anyway, I bound my chest and put the green tank top back on, and that shirt made me feel more comfortable and more confident than any other article of clothing I purchased today.

This brings me back to a certain dilemma. I sometimes wonder why it is this cheap green tank from the boys' section could make me feel more like myself and more confident than my very favorite pair of heels: a pair of burgundy combat boots that I love to bits. I loved them from the first time I ever laid eyes on them on a thrift shop rack, and I immediately knew that I needed those shoes to be mine, and not only are they very comfortable, but as a concept, I am in love with these shoes. When I put them on, for a moment it really does feel like I look good and I _feel_ good when I'm walking in them, but those heels never made me feel as confident as putting on that green tank top today. It makes me wonder if I feel more genuinely confident in masculinity because I have some preconceived notion of what femininity is or should be.

I've been dressing particularly fem lately, trying to dress in the ways I think I would like to, but on that note I tend to only feel confident in being feminine when I dissociate myself from it. I only really feel pretty if I sort of pretend the person in the mirror is some other person — some other girl — and perhaps that is why I tend to stray away from my face when taking pictures of myself and viewing myself because it is easier to picture that I'm someone else who _is_ very confident and self-assured and feels as if this is the right role for them. And this works decently well when I'm in the right frame of mind, which, as it stands, I am, but it doesn't feel as natural and it does oftentimes feel somewhat rehearsed. Even on its best days, it never truly feels like me and still causes me to pause and think through my life through the lens of, “Is this I want to be and present myself as?” 

So then that brings me to the question of am I looking for some kind of escape from what I believe society would expect from me as a girl or a woman, or am I genuinely just more content in gender nonconformity for my own personal reasons that there is no great amount of depth to? Why is it that I prefer the green tank top aside from just I like the way it fits me? 

I may never truly get the answer to this question that I would like to, and I wouldn't say I've _accepted_ that, but I would say that I don't believe I have the energy at this point in time to devote to giving this more thought because I have spent _so_ many hours thinking about this in my lifeand what it is going to turn out like and if I am wasting my time. If I'll somehow be hurting myself and/or other people by somehow choosing to present between lines. If I am a complete liar for saying that I genuinely wish at times to just not have to be a girl, and not necessarily because I am expected to be a girl, but because when I look in the mirror, it's not me that I am staring at but rather a female shell that I've been given.

This is a far longer post than I intended it to be, but here we are. Atleast I can say that I've gotten all of my thoughts out of my head, so perhaps I will be able to sleep okay tonight, but that might be too much to expect.",NonBinary,"Do I prefer masculinity because I have problems with expections of feminity, or is it really not that deep?",1567326633.0,"{'created_utc': 1567301433, 'id': 'cy3xgz', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 16, 'selftext': ""Two words: Walmart clearance.\n\nSo today I went to Walmart and I ended up purchasing, between other random feminine clothing items, two tank tops, and only upon cashing at self-checkout did I realize that one came from the girls' section and the other from the boys' section, which at least explained why the tags said they were different sizes but I could clearly see with my own eyes that they were about the same size.

2019-09-02 06:49:39,cyljjs,3,10,"First-time posting in this lovely community! 

I’m an AFAB NB that’s pretty pronoun apathetic, but I’m quickly realizing that’s making it difficult for me to own my gender representation as a new teacher for a few reasons: 
- honorifics are a must here, and while I’ve tried to use Mx., it’s really not catching on. Kids usually call me “Miss!”  without even using my last name 
-I have 32FF breasts and don’t usually experience physical dysphoria, so a lot of my wardrobe, while inspired by men’s fashion, doesn’t exactly hide my breasts. This was no obstacle to coworkers respecting my gender identity in my office-jobs, but it’s meant that kids and adults automatically gender me publicly in the classroom/hallways.
- about half my students come from monolingual Spanish-speaking households. I speak Spanish, but have not found a gender- neutral honorific to introduce myself by that translates. 
- 99% of the adults at the school are either overtly or casually transphobic and homophobic. The only one I’ve found that doesn’t seem to mind luckily is right next door, but he doesn’t really understand what NB even means and doesn’t seek understanding. (I.e. We’re both team “who-cares-what-the-kids-wear” and “boys vs girls activities are outdated and trite”, but he doesn’t seem to have a concept of genderqueerness of any kind, and thinks any advocacy is probably too risky/not worth it.
- The fact that we have a super old building with no gender-neutral restrooms for students and gender-segregated teacher’s lounges (!!)doesn’t help at all. 


Any advice on...?
- how I can better represent myself as the genderqueer and queer person I am without getting in trouble/ losing valuable relationships with the transphobic/ homophobic staff (I usually wouldn’t care what coworkers think, but I’m fresh out of college and working in a very low-income school where I’m going to need all the help I can get, and everyone is honestly so kind aside from the aggressive gendering and willing to help me with anything) 
- how I can be a better advocate for trans rights (and create a safe space for all LGBTQ+ students) living in the great state of Texas despite the “No Homo Promo” laws 
- how I can push back against the school’s transphobic culture in subtle yet meaningful ways (from what I gather, 95% of the staff seams to justify transphobic thinking with Black Church culture, which seems to be a key feature in the school’s  culture. As one of 4 non-black staff members (the only Asian) and the only non-Christian staff member, I want to respect whatever community solidarity underlines these attitudes because it seems to help keep the kids in school, but I still want to undermine these harmful transphobic beliefs )

I know that’s a lot but tl;dr: being a racial, religious, gender, and sexual minority, how do I advocate for myself and others as an NB teacher when my coworkers and students readily gender me, without jeopardizing  crucial relationships with transphobic staff or disrupting their interpretation of the Black Church culture which seems beneficial to student retention rates on-face?

However. For the past 5 years I've been becoming steadily closer to my boyfriend's family, most notably his dad. I've become very close friends with his dad. I was close friend's with my bf's sister before I got with my bf and she is very accepting of me. My bf is bi and is chill with any transitioning. But his dad. It's so frustrating because he is genuinely a good, kind, compassionate person. Very accepting usually. But he doesn't get trans or enby folx. It's fucking painful, really. I've explained myself to him but said I do need to work through some stuff. So he said (in a kind way) ""I hope you find yourself soon"" and I said I have found myself, I just have to work through some of my more toxic thoughts that are the result of bottling my feelings for so many years. This was at the start of last week. Then near the end of the week we were standing outside a shop with their dog, waiting for my friend and bf to come out (no pun intended), and he said ""so you found yourself and you're straight, yeah?""

But I just cannot get him to come to terms with it. It's like he thinks I'm old enough to know I'm straight, but too young to know I'm trans.

And I do agree with that, BUT NOT IN THIS CONTEXT AHHHHGH. I have changed in so many ways, but one way I have not changed is in being trans. It's like how he has never stopped loving art and film. Bad comparison, but you get my point. Sometimes people just don't change about certain things. He's even used the slur ""tr\*\*ny"" jokingly about some dumb Mii on the Switch me and my bf made, but me, my bf and my friend all spoke up about him using the slur. I think he thought we were being over the top though. It's so frustrating because he's pretty damn liberal and accepting apart from this.

I'm totally new to this whole community and I haven't really come out about my new identity, my fiance kinda knows and she is so very understanding, not something I ever expected of her. Anyway why I'm here is because I don't really have any LGBT+ friends, it's just me and my girl, I really miss having community ya know? But even then, I've never been a part of the enby community before and I think it's what I really need. 

Let me give y'all some background on me.   I came out as a lesbian at 15, at 16 after reading a particularly good webcomic I started question my gender, What I really a female lesbian? Or was I actually a straight male? I did a lot of research and concluded that no, penis is icky and therefore I must be just a female lesbian. Skip ahead to 26 and on a long car ride with my girl we got on to the discussion of gender. We were right in the middle of Australia campaigning for marriage equality and gender was suddenly thrown into the limelight and not just male or female. 

It was during this discussion that I realised that I don't identify as a lady or woman, but girl is ok. 

3 years later (8 weeks ago) and whilst in the middle of having a mental break about my partner desperately wanting to be poly I saw an article on Facebook about Non-binary people taking T to feel more like themselves. It struck a chord with me, like everything suddenly fell into place but also suddenly everything got really confusing. Who was I? 

So I went into research mode again but this time there's so much more information and it's helped me so much more than 12 years ago. Reddit has been such a big help. I can finally say that I'm happy with who I am. Yes I have some mild body disphoria but I am happy knowing that I no long identify as a female lesbian. I'm an enby queer and proud of it. 

Now I just have to work out how to tell my friends..

I was assigned female at birth, and always identified as female for as long as I could remember, but I remember moments during my childhood when I wanted to be a boy instead of a girl and even voicing these wants. However the want wasn’t always there, just sometimes, but when it was I remember it was strong. I still get the feeling sometimes, but I don’t voice it out loud anymore.

I look at myself, and I find I hate my boobs. Not in a “oh they don’t look the way I want them too,” way, but in a “I wish they didn’t exist” way. 

And the few times I’ve been either mistaken for a boy or had people unsure of my gender actually made me feel happy instead of offended or annoyed. I even recently had a dream where I accidentally ran (literally) into a group of girls playing basketball (don’t ask me why I was anywhere near a basketball court in my dream when I have 0 athletic abilities in real life lol) and they couldn’t tell if I was a boy or a girl, and when they asked my dream self said “neither.”

So to wrap things up, I’m not exactly sure what I should do or how to process this. Coming out is out of the question at the moment (parents would accept me, but I can’t guarantee my grandparents, my aunty, or my stepparents and their families will, and while I could live without my stepfamily members if I had to, I can’t live without my grandparents or my aunty; I love them too much to risk losing them).

2019-09-04 21:41:30,czr9hd,1,4,"A thought that's been bouncing around my head recently is what if agender isn't so much a gender identity to me so much as a statement of how my assigned sex makes me feel? 

^also works as tl;dr. You can skip the rest. 

To me the feeling of being agender comes from two logical angles - a sense of detachment from my assigned gender because I don't feel it represents who I am and a sense of detachment from the opposite because it's not how I was raised and socialised. Ultimately I don't know if my utter apathy and sense of disconnect from my gender is an identity unto itself or simply dysphoria in its own right and a sign that I'm actually FtM. 

So I thought I would for and against this in a long form rather than bullet point way. But essentially:

Agender: disconnect from the idea of gender. No sense of connection to either sex or a combination. Lack of a strong drive to masculinise or feminise myself. This is how I feel either as a cause or consequence of my gender.

However. FtM: I enjoy packing and binding. Unlike many other AFAB NB people I've seen discuss what theyd like or dislike about HRT I don't feel averse to the idea of changes on testosterone, bottom growth included. My ideal body type is something like male ballerina or figure skater but part of what makes it so tantalising is that I feel so close to it (I'm maybe quarter decently androgynous). Gender euphoria is always triggered by in some way being seen or seeing myself or planning to see myself as more male. I struggle to see myself in NB people. On the other hand I don't feel male enough to be male or female enough to be female. I see butch women as more masculine than me in their presentation but also more woman than me - connected to both their body and their presentation in a way I'm not. But I'm not sure I see myself in ftm people either, or cis people. Yet I feel joy in spotting people who I feel look like 'the male version of me' even before I'd ever discovered trans content.

There is an agender youtuber called Chandler who is transitioning on T. To first glance from me they read as completely male now. So I guess it's possible for an agender person to want to transition and appear male without feeling or identifying as male. 

Some further notes: I feel 99% of the time unable to look good as a woman or as a man without HRT. Even when I recognise in some photos I look objectively good as a woman it doesn't give me affirmative pleasure: 'that's me looking great' so much as 'yeah that objectively looks good'. When I see more masculine photos of me it's more complex. Something I like and something I don't. In the moment I tend to feel good about the photos only to feel somehow disappointed later, like I missed something. 

Maybe I'm just a bit of a disassociative person who will never see themself in photos. Or mirrors. Or recall events afterwards as if I was really there rather than dreaming. Sometimes I think maybe it's depression, but I know I do feel happy fairly often in fact, I just don't relate to it afterwards. As though it happened to someone else. Perhaps it's a coping strategy from my youth that never left and consumed my gender with it.

I'm occasionally filled with both excitement and terror at the thought of being ftm. The thought of being agender fills me with the same deep apathy that my assigned gender already does. But perhaps that's precisely because it's who I am. Perhaps that's because it's what's normal or right and I'm just chasing a high thrill that isn't an actual reality I want. I mean, I do enjoy being invisible. It allows me to get away with being effeminate and gesticulating and liking soft things and men and discussing feelings more easily should the mood strike. People know me as this body and this voice and this name. 

Then there's the asexuality. If dysphoria is the cause of it (my narrative doesn't gel with many other asexuals as I don't feel repulsed by it in general or by touching another person (I can get aroused making out) but I simply cannot get into getting naked myself and being touched, especially There and There.) then that might add plus one to the gender dysphoria column. I remember suggesting to a friend even before I discovered trans content that I might enjoy sex in a male body. But perhaps I simply have a 'yaoi kink' that I cannot now undo. Even if I were to transition FtM it would not be cis male organs I would be working with, meaning dysphoria would likely keep me asexual but possibly even more frustrated even assuing I'm not just asexual anyway and would have felt the same had I been born as a cis man. Who knows. 

So my conclusion is basically that I have no conclusion, and even if I found one it would be an impossible choice to make. My dysphoria (if that's what it is) is too low to really merit significant transition steps, but too noticeable for me to completely ignore it now it's been pointed out. I'm too comfortable with my social role to eagerly change it but just uncomfortable enough to feel that this comfy spot was never really mine. I'm too practical for they/them, too physically distant from he/him, but have no resonance with she/her.

I don't think there's a good solution. Perhaps my best shot is simply to forge ahead with my life as best I can, disconnected from myself as I am, disembodied pilot that I am, and just do my best through hobbies and hard work. If only I could find the motivation and energy to forge myself a future. But I'm not depressed. I can focus if I have to and I can get out of bed and even enjoy hobbies and laugh. I guess if I'm not depressed though I'm just being pathetic. 

I spiral too easy and get melodramatic too easy. Gross. I should just get off the internet and or delete this post. Yeah. I'll do that. Gender is the least of my problems. I'll leave it up a little while though. It took a while to write after all.

It allows me to get away with being effeminate and gesticulating and liking soft things and men and discussing feelings more easily should the mood strike. People know me as this body and this voice and this name. \n\nThen there's the asexuality. If dysphoria is the cause of it (my narrative doesn't gel with many other asexuals as I don't feel repulsed by it in general or by touching another person (I can get aroused making out) but I simply cannot get into getting naked myself and being touched, especially There and There.) then that might add plus one to the gender dysphoria column. I remember suggesting to a friend even before I discovered trans content that I might enjoy sex in a male body. But perhaps I simply have a 'yaoi kink' that I cannot now undo. Even if I were to transition FtM it would not be cis male organs I would be working with, meaning dysphoria would likely keep me asexual but possibly even more frustrated even assuing I'm not just asexual anyway and would have felt the same had I been born as a cis man. Who knows. \n\nSo my conclusion is basically that I have no conclusion, and even if I found one it would be an impossible choice to make. My dysphoria (if that's what it is) is too low to really merit significant transition steps, but too noticeable for me to completely ignore it now it's been pointed out. I'm too comfortable with my social role to eagerly change it but just uncomfortable enough to feel that this comfy spot was never really mine. I'm too practical for they/them, too physically distant from he/him, but have no resonance with she/her.\n\nI don't think there's a good solution. Perhaps my best shot is simply to forge ahead with my life as best I can, disconnected from myself as I am, disembodied pilot that I am, and just do my best through hobbies and hard work. If only I could find the motivation and energy to forge myself a future. But I'm not depressed. I can focus if I have to and I can get out of bed and even enjoy hobbies and laugh. I guess if I'm not depressed though I'm just being pathetic. \n\nI spiral too easy and get melodramatic too easy. Gross. I should just get off the internet and or delete this post. Yeah. I'll do that. Gender is the least of my problems. I'll leave it up a little while though. It took a while to write after all. \n\nRight, time to get off my ass and cook some pasta."", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Agender dysphoria?', 'created': 1567658490.0}"

I tried to explain to her that i like it because people who see feminine boys often assume that they're gay (which is obviously bullshit, and that's what i'm trying to explain to the kids too), which means it's recognized by people that i'm presenting more or less feminine and look perhaps nearly androgynous, and that gives me validation.

2019-09-05 04:45:30,czw5nc,11,17,"Burner account because I don't want to out myself until I figure all this shit out.

AMAB enby discovering who I am at 30. Spent 16 years /w long hair and baggy clothing, believing that I couldn't feel good about the way I look, or that I had to learn to feel good looking masculine. I had a fair number of dreams as a teen that I had entirely female sex characteristics, \_(though also plenty where I didn't)\_ and throughout my life they'd come back from time to time, though less frequently. Used to steal my sister's clothes. Religious family that intermittently espoused some transphobic shit I think I internalized more than I'd like to admit.

Fast-forward to now, been talking to a close friend about the same age who recently very quietly came out as non-binary. Been chatting /w my partner/fiance about how I used to wear her/my sister's clothes, was less overtly masculine, how I seem to fixate on trans women and trans issues, etc... There was a long list, mostly stuff I hadn't noticed myself.

The precipitating event for this was when I gave myself a very stereotypically male haircut. Did it because I'm losing my hair and it's totally unmanageable due to thinness. I thought I would feel better not having a wiry, wispy mess of hair, but looking at myself in the mirror made me feel awful. My partner \_(we've been together for over a decade, so she knows me pretty well)\_ suggested this might be gender dysphoria, which lead to the aforementioned series of discussions about gender identity.

Talking about this and realizing that I've never really identified /w masculinity and have been forcing it for so long was really freeing and empowering. Or at least, I thought it was. Been doing a lot of stuff \_(/w my partner mostly)\_ that I've actively avoided for so long- trying on her clothes, shaving my body hair, got piercings. Doing this stuff feels really great, and even though I'm not perfectly happy with how I look, I've been feeling more confident than I've felt in ages. Maybe ever. And my partner is so supportive that I tear up just thinking about it.

There's a catch, though. Every time I do something affirming, I feel a little more sick when I look in the mirror, or see my reflection in glass. I've been being hit with waves of what I guess is dysphoria every day, and I swear they're getting worse. I oscillate between feeling ok and like I'm almost fine /w looking like a guy sometimes to being absolutely miserable when I look at myself. Today it was so intense that it was all I could do to keep from breaking down crying. I can't remember feeling like this. I wanted to claw my way out of my own skin.

I don't know what I feel like anymore, and I don't even know how I can feel like this now. Can I really have repressed this for over 15 years? Is this everything coming out at once? Am I going to feel better eventually? I feel like I uncorked something in my head and now it's screaming at me constantly.

I'm not sure I feel female, but I feel so strongly that I do not feel male. I think non-binary describes how I feel. Bottom surgery has no appeal to me. I don't feel weird about not having breasts. But I hate my body hair. I hate it so much I spent an hour and a half removing it and it's the best I've ever felt, even though I'm itchy and bleeding and covered in bumps. I hate that I accumulate so much fatty tissue near my middle, but I can \_sort of\_ reconcile with that.

I hate that my hairline is receding, I hate that I look like my male relatives, I hate that know exactly how I'm going to go bald, I hate that my face isn't more feminine, and I absolutely loathe how it all comes together to create something that feels perfectly alien and repulsive to me.

I don't know what any of this means, and I sure as hell don't know what to do about it.

I don't want to think about HRT because intellectually I suspect that it will actually be counterproductive and the side-effects would probably cause me and my partner a great deal of emotional pain. I honestly can't even bring myself to research it because I don't want to travel down a confirmation-bias-shaped road to a place I won't be able to get my head out of.

I'm so scared. Part of me wants to put the genie back in the bottle, but I think I sailed past that a week or so ago.

I just want someone to tell me that 30 is too late to start hormone therapy and that it's a bad idea and that I should just wait and see how I feel and that everything is going to be fine and I'm eventually going to feel better about presenting as ""male"" sometimes and that I can somehow balance all of this and not end up screwing up my life. I want to believe that I will be able to see my reflection and not feel like I'm seeing some kind of cruel joke.

Most of all though, I want to stop obsessing over this. I just want to hit the pause button on all this gender identity shit until I get the rest of the crazy shit in my life dealt with. I can't imagine a worse time to be confronting all of this.

Can't I just like, stop and pick this back up in like 3 months or so? Please?

IDK. I just want to feel normal. I thought I felt fine a week or two ago. Why did wearing a few dresses, getting my ears pierced, and shaving my body take me from 0 to total-breakdown-identity-crisis territory in a hot minute? Is this normal?

When I think about myself and who I am, I never feel like I'm male or female I just feel like I'm myself and that's how I want to be viewed.

 When it comes to fashion, my fashion sense is pretty neutral, leaning more to the masc side of things though. My hair, again, is also pretty neutral, it's short and messy but leans a bit more to the fem side. (Ik choosing to dress or style yourself in a fem, masc, or neutral way is just preference and doesn't change your gender identity but I thought I would mention it.)

 I feel very uncomfortable and ashamed of having breasts, I try to make them appear flatter by wearing sports bras (that I only remove to shower) and I avoid clothing that would accentuate them.(Tight and clingy fabrics or low cut shirts) Having a period sucks as well, I know anyone can have one but, it's viewed as such a womanly thing that I feel like I shouldn't have one.

It feels weird and silly to call myself a woman, or a lady, or a girl but I don't mind being called she/her pronouns. It's what I've always been called and I don't really care, although I do find it funny when I'm called or told to act like a woman,lady,girl,miss,etc. 

When it comes to being called they/them no one has ever called me that but I wouldn't mind being called that either. 

However, I don't like being called he/him, I've had people call me he/him in a negative way before and it would just seem off putting to be called he/him. 

(Pronouns are also a sort of non issue with me because they don't really come up for me that often. I'm either called by name,nickname, or dude and my gender has never been a point of discussion with my friends or family.)

I also feel conflicted on calling myself non-binary or anything other than cis-gender because, besides my issues with my period and breasts, I don't think I really experience a lot of gender dysphoria ~~plenty of body dysmorphia tho lmao~~. (My chest especially is a huge issue for me but idk)

i think the dysphoria is actually a sign i’m on the right path. i’m confronting some very uncomfortable feelings and this deep seated belief that if i’m not connected to being a man or woman in some way that i’m just a “girl who wants to be special.” i don’t believe that on a logical level but transphobia can take root and get in your head anyways. i don’t have to speak in binary terms about myself and i’m finally accepting that. 

that said, unfortunately dysphoria is now a big part of my life again and i’m feeling it almost nonstop. i wish i was amab so i could have my ideal body type (although that in and of itself would bring new kinds of dysphoria). i wish i was taller and that i had a masculine body type that was still somewhat feminine. i think i’d look more that way if i was very thin but losing weight would be impossible without methods that would damage my health. i wanted to go on t so i can be androgynous but i’m scared that i’ll be gendered as a guy so i’ve almost given up on the idea. maybe microdosing is an option, i don't know. everything about me is very feminine and cute and i think if i was a cis woman i’d feel much more confident and happy. yet instead i feel incredibly awful and uncomfortable because of dysphoria and knowing that those cute qualities are what gender me as a girl for most people. i feel like i can’t appreciate how i look at all.

2019-09-05 19:59:46,d05xvl,0,13,"So I've not kept my sliding gender or increased confusion a secret from my NB friend. Today in little ways they suggested I could choose the male avatar when I was making us a sim household and also that I was jokingly the husband when I mentioned I'd jokingly labelled them under wife in our uni days together.

Another thing is that in picking my sim's voice pitch (my voice is low for an AFAB) they helped me by recording me voice and playing it back to me. And I was shocked how low it was. When I've recorded it myself at home I've usually found it either high or sort of neutral but I know when I relax it drops even lower and I'm more comfortable with my friend than at home wondering if my housemates will overhear me talking. But I also know that I disassociate from my higher range. My surprise at my low voice was just sort of a sudden surprise and I couldn't tell what I really thought or if it was negative or positive. It was mostly just: wow, that's lower than I remember it being. Is it just me that hears it that low? But it's not like I want a higher one.

The other thing is, I've tried choosing the male body type in sims 3 before. And I didn't really prefer it, although that may just be because the avatar didn't really end up looking how I imagine the male version of me. I didn't really connect with this female one either although I recognised they looked somewhat? more like me. 

When I'm expecting it or leading the convo with gender non conforming jokes like I'm such a dad friend or whatever it feels okay or good, but when others say it feels sort of mildly alarming. Sort of a shit this is real? Is this real? That could mean anything.

It might be that anything other than androgyny with just an edge of safe cis leaning passing makes me uncomfortable. It might be that I prefer as close to androgyny as I can possibly get. 

I think I'm averse to the idea of being NB as much as I accept it's likely. It seems so nebulous. A gender on a cloud. I came out as months ago to said friend as agender but I don't think I've really been able to process or accept it. I think I could more easily accept being binary trans in a certain sense, but am more afraid of it in another. As it is, it sort of feels like I've lost my gender and I feel very untethered. And right now as I think about it and test it more in small ways I'm very aware that it's missing. I would like to connect with my assigned sex or with the opposite; to be left drifting feels odd.

There's a last test I can try. I will find an LGBT group and try he/him pronouns and a male name for long enough to really see how I feel about it.

But I'm afraid that in the end I really may be a 'they'. And if it's always been true and my agender feeling is not just a symptom of a more binary desire, it's a weird feeling to be finally aware of. As much as I'm fine with the truth of NB people in general, I want to be sure that it's my personal truth. Then I'll go from there.

2019-09-05 22:52:00,d0858b,12,17,"Hello everyone!  


I've been wanting to make this post for around a year and a half. Finally, I made a new account to post this with. There's a lot I'm going to cover since I'm trying to get my thoughts straight. This is a huge and self-indulgent post. My experience with dysphoria &amp; gender has been... strange, and I've felt rather alone for a long time. I haven't met anyone I can truly relate to despite knowing many trans and nonbinary people throughout the years. If anyone here shares my experience, I'd love to hear! If you have any insight, it would also be greatly appreciated!  


**Body Dysphoria**

Despite my protests, I am AMAB. I've been on estradiol patches and a hormone blocker injection for 1.5 years. During this time I have moved a lot and struggled to stay on HRT consistently. My hormones have fluctuated greatly.

I have yet to get any surgeries but have three in mind: SRS, top surgery, and one notable face tweak.

My dysphoria is a sizeable lad and affects me daily. It's quite painful and at times debilitating. The main sources of my dysphoria are my genitalia, my face, being misgendered/deadnamed, and... my breasts. The universe has an ironic sense of humor.

Before starting HRT I was entirely unsure if I wanted breasts. I tried simulating having breasts but knew my true feelings could only surface after I grew my own. Prior to HRT I researched ways to take estrogen without chest growth, but it went nowhere. Starting estrogen was a leap of faith.

HahahA it hurts. I got a binder shortly after my chest started growing. The dysphoria hit harder than I could have anticipated. Feeling them grow in was disturbing. This coincided with a traumatic event around my chest, and I just... hated them. I felt way better overall from estrogen and knew I couldn't stop HRT, but this was something new to deal with.

I stopped binding for some time and tried to embrace my chest. Maybe I'd learn to love my breasts and how they made my profile more feminine. I felt ok about my chest for a good chunk of 2018. Never *good,* but I could manage. They never fully registered as a part of my body. During this time I tried presenting female and thought I'd ""finally accepted"" I'm ""just a trans woman.""

Nah. A couple of months ago I had a watershed moment with my gender &amp; presentation. My chest dysphoria came roaring back and now I'm binding daily. My ""male"" features still cause equally bad dysphoria, but my chest bothers me more often. It's the most visible and obtrusive dysphoric body part. I don't want people to see my chest or find it sexually desirable or anything. Considering I'm AMAB, it's hard to find anyone else with this experience. Trans women typically start HRT to *get* breasts and are often happy to have them. I find myself having to explain &amp; justify my dysphoria even to other trans people.

**Gender Fluctuation**

When I first realized I'm trans, I embraced being a girl &amp; a lesbian super hard online. It took time before I came out IRL. During this period I knew next to nothing about nonbinary people but started meeting some. I had a strange fascination with their way of being.

Eventually, I started going to a queer support group/hangout space and finally could be out IRL. This was huge for me. I met a ton of nonbinary people and started questioning myself again. When faced with the freedom to be a girl IRL, something felt off. I hadn't started HRT yet at this time and didn't know what was to come. At some point I went ""fuck it"" and began experimenting with androgynous presentation, binding, using ey/em pronouns, and a gender-neutral name. Being nonbinary felt freeing.

I met the first person I ever dated in that group, a lovely polygender enby. We had a confusing &amp; short-lived romance where neither of us knew what to call the other. There were no boyfriends or girlfriends involved! We stayed friends for a long time afterward, and I look back on our time together fondly.

HRT hit at some point and confirmed my suspicions about being gender-deviant. As time went on, though, I started missing girlhood. I got gender stage fright. Despite being around queer people IRL, I feared to embrace my femininity. It felt weak, vulnerable, and looked ""wrong"" on my still masculinized body. I still had a lot of male conditioning to contest with. That was a very angry time where being nonbinary genuinely was a ""safe"" purgatory before I could better accept myself.

Then something big happened. I met someone at a mock government event. They were agender and equal parts androgyny, beauty, and danger. We connected immediately and had a disastrous kerosene fire of a fling. This them fatale saw my desire for girlhood and femininity and downright *told* me to accept it. I wore a dress in public for the first time, to a big dance nonetheless. Despite their own nonbinary status, they felt justified in telling me I'm ""just a woman."" It was incredibly toxic and I got out, but the damage was done. I began presenting very feminine, using she/her, and eventually switched to a ""properly feminine"" name.

After escaping that abusive person, I fell into questioning my gender again. Despite trying on the nonbinary label again, I concluded it was ""time to grow up and accept the boring truth."" I was a trans woman and needed to learn to love my body. This got weird and I thought I was attracted to men for a while. Compulsive heterosexuality hit me hard for a time. I dressed Womanly and could feel good about it, but it never quite looked right. I'm now back to knowing myself as a lesbian, though.

Finally, I met a new friend in a new city. She's a trans woman and has studied gender variance a good bit. We started having Big Talks and eventually got to my gender history &amp; presentation. She hit me with the words ""You seem really butch,"" and it broke me. I cried for a few days. I finally accepted womanhood and femininity felt like transitioning into another mask.

**Where I'm At Now**

I don't know what to call myself and I'm tired of looking for labels. Nothing fits right. If look deep within myself for a Gender, I find nothing. I feel an emptiness where that part of me should be. It's comfortable in its own right.

""Man,"" ""he,"" and other male words hurt. I joke that I'm a twink, though, and like fucking around with ""boy,"" ""prince,"" and other playful masculine terms. I use she/her pronouns, though I'm curious about neopronouns like xey/xem. They/them does not feel like me. My current name is decidedly feminine, but I'm drawn to androgynous ones. I change my name every time I move cities it seems, and I've never been that tied to one. ""Woman,"" ""girl, and ""female"" feel off in some way, though ""girl"" is really cute and bothers me the least.

I am a lesbian and see myself in butch history, though I don't consider myself butch. I relate to trans guys, nonbinary people, and trans women in different ways. When I talk with trans guys we can complain about having tits. When I talk with trans women we can complain about having dicks. When I talk to enbies I feel the most understood. There's no community I feel truly at home in, though.

My presentation is androgynous-leaning-masculine, with sporadic genderfucked days. Usually I wear black skinny jeans, a binder, T-shirts, suspenders or a belt, vans or boots, a hat. I love jackets with big pockets and military-inspired clothing. Blue-collar butch is the lesbian aesthetic I resonate with most. When I feel like having fun I'll throw on a short skirt, knee socks, fishnets, and some light makeup, but keep the binder and often suspenders. I like looking androgynous &amp; confusing, and don't feel comfortable going full masc or femme. I bind underneath dresses if I wear them. My mannerisms are boyish and I'm generally quite confident and outgoing.

Many questions remain unanswered for me. What name do I really want? What pronouns? Do I *genuinely* want top surgery, or am I going to accept my body eventually? Is this just a phase? Will I get over myself someday and accept I'm just a trans woman? Why don't any words, names, or labels ever feel right?

Thank you for reading. Again, I would *love* to hear if you have any similar experiences. Your feedback and time is greatly appreciated. This post has been incubating for a long time. I've had a lot to get off my chest.",NonBinary,Weird Dysphoria / AMAB &amp; Nonbinary / Big Post Energy / Life Story,1567749120.0,"{'created_utc': 1567723920, 'id': 'd0858b', 'num_comments': 12, 'score': 17, 'selftext': 'Hello everyone!  \n\n\nI\'ve been wanting to make this post for around a year and a half. Finally, I made a new account to post this with. There\'s a lot I\'m going to cover since I\'m trying to get my thoughts straight. This is a huge and self-indulgent post. My experience with dysphoria &amp; gender has been... strange, and I\'ve felt rather alone for a long time. I haven\'t met anyone I can truly relate to despite knowing many trans and nonbinary people throughout the years. If anyone here shares my experience, I\'d love to hear! If you have any insight, it would also be greatly appreciated!  \n\n\n**Body Dysphoria**\n\nDespite my protests, I am AMAB. I\'ve been on estradiol patches and a hormone blocker injection for 1.5 years. During this time I have moved a lot and struggled to stay on HRT consistently. My hormones have fluctuated greatly.\n\nI have yet to get any surgeries but have three in mind: SRS, top surgery, and one notable face tweak.\n\nMy dysphoria is a sizeable lad and affects me daily. It\'s quite painful and at times debilitating. The main sources of my dysphoria are my genitalia, my face, being misgendered/deadnamed, and... my breasts. The universe has an ironic sense of humor.\n\nBefore starting HRT I was entirely unsure if I wanted breasts. I tried simulating having breasts but knew my true feelings could only surface after I grew my own. Prior to HRT I researched ways to take estrogen without chest growth, but it went nowhere. Starting estrogen was a leap of faith.\n\nHahahA it hurts. I got a binder shortly after my chest started growing. The dysphoria hit harder than I could have anticipated. Feeling them grow in was disturbing. This coincided with a traumatic event around my chest, and I just... hated them. I felt way better overall from estrogen and knew I couldn\'t stop HRT, but this was something new to deal with.\n\nI stopped binding for some time and tried to embrace my chest. Maybe I\'d learn to love my breasts and how they made my profile more feminine. I felt ok about my chest for a good chunk of 2018. Never *good,* but I could manage. They never fully registered as a part of my body. During this time I tried presenting female and thought I\'d ""finally accepted"" I\'m ""just a trans woman.""\n\nNah. A couple of months ago I had a watershed moment with my gender &amp; presentation. My chest dysphoria came roaring back and now I\'m binding daily. My ""male"" features still cause equally bad dysphoria, but my chest bothers me more often. It\'s the most visible and obtrusive dysphoric body part. I don\'t want people to see my chest or find it sexually desirable or anything. Considering I\'m AMAB, it\'s hard to find anyone else with this experience. Trans women typically start HRT to *get* breasts and are often happy to have them. I find myself having to explain &amp; justify my dysphoria even to other trans people.\n\n**Gender Fluctuation**\n\nWhen I first realized I\'m trans, I embraced being a girl &amp; a lesbian super hard online. It took time before I came out IRL. During this period I knew next to nothing about nonbinary people but started meeting some. I had a strange fascination with their way of being.\n\nEventually, I started going to a queer support group/hangout space and finally could be out IRL. This was huge for me. I met a ton of nonbinary people and started questioning myself again. When faced with the freedom to be a girl IRL, something felt off. I hadn\'t started HRT yet at this time and didn\'t know what was to come. At some point I went ""fuck it"" and began experimenting with androgynous presentation, binding, using ey/em pronouns, and a gender-neutral name. Being nonbinary felt freeing.\n\nI met the first person I ever dated in that group, a lovely polygender enby. We had a confusing &amp; short-lived romance where neither of us knew what to call the other. There were no boyfriends or girlfriends involved! We stayed friends for a long time afterward, and I look back on our time together fondly.\n\nHRT hit at some point and confirmed my suspicions about being gender-deviant. As time went on, though, I started missing girlhood. I got gender stage fright. Despite being around queer people IRL, I feared to embrace my femininity. It felt weak, vulnerable, and looked ""wrong"" on my still masculinized body. I still had a lot of male conditioning to contest with. That was a very angry time where being nonbinary genuinely was a ""safe"" purgatory before I could better accept myself.\n\nThen something big happened. I met someone at a mock government event. They were agender and equal parts androgyny, beauty, and danger. We connected immediately and had a disastrous kerosene fire of a fling. This them fatale saw my desire for girlhood and femininity and downright *told* me to accept it. I wore a dress in public for the first time, to a big dance nonetheless. Despite their own nonbinary status, they felt justified in telling me I\'m ""just a woman."" It was incredibly toxic and I got out, but the damage was done. I began presenting very feminine, using she/her, and eventually switched to a ""properly feminine"" name.\n\nAfter escaping that abusive person, I fell into questioning my gender again. Despite trying on the nonbinary label again, I concluded it was ""time to grow up and accept the boring truth."" I was a trans woman and needed to learn to love my body. This got weird and I thought I was attracted to men for a while. Compulsive heterosexuality hit me hard for a time. I dressed Womanly and could feel good about it, but it never quite looked right. I\'m now back to knowing myself as a lesbian, though.\n\nFinally, I met a new friend in a new city. She\'s a trans woman and has studied gender variance a good bit. We started having Big Talks and eventually got to my gender history &amp; presentation. She hit me with the words ""You seem really butch,"" and it broke me. I cried for a few days. I finally accepted womanhood and femininity felt like transitioning into another mask.\n\n**Where I\'m At Now**\n\nI don\'t know what to call myself and I\'m tired of looking for labels. Nothing fits right. If look deep within myself for a Gender, I find nothing. I feel an emptiness where that part of me should be.

I have recently identified as NB (last month or so) I have seen a psychologist, psychiatrist, will be seeing a 2nd psychiatrist soon to confirm body dysphoria, and possibly be on HRT in the future.

That all said, NB just felt like the most appropriate and fitting title to fall under for what I have always felt myself to be. Somewhere in-between, but not really genderfluid. Even when not having an official title back in the day and retrospectively looking at my surpressed emotions and depression surrounding my body up until now.

It even came up in my recent psychologist visit as they asked how i feel fully transitioning to female. 

My answer: ""Honestly no. Not at this time at least. Nut if i were to get GCS, i would be happy with that. If it evolves to fully transotioning, fine. But the V..et's go with the two scenarios, AMAB (which is the current situation) and AFAB. 

AMAB scenario, I dont want my plumbing. I can say that for sure. But to give myself the plumbing I want requires HRT for 1 year. Which if I develop breasts in the process... Fine. I have never liked my body or looks and I want to feel that. So if the HRT/breasts end up being a ""side effect"" of getting the plumbing i feel is correct for me, then I will handle that (binding or maybe surgery. 

In the AFAB scenario, I would buzz my hair shorter and get top surgery. 

Either way, i know I would not be happy as a male. And in the current AMAB scenario, I dont believe I would be happy fully transitioned and I will meed to be somewhere in-between.""

Psych: ""Alright, you sound confident and have past history of gender confusion and body dysphoria. Check out WPATH.""

I announced to my family as NB last month, but have not yet divulged the desire for surgery, or the process that requires HRT. 

There is a mix of excitement and anxiety over the potential horizon of GCS. But ultimately, to feel more comfortable in my own skin/body, GCS seems to be the way I need to go.

This is a qualitative study that will examine the attitudes and experiences of non-binary, gender nonconforming, and genderqueer parents. The research will answer the question: how do GNC individuals transition into parenthood, and how to they share the roles and responsibilities of parenting?

Sociologists have extensively studied parenting and gender inequality in home. Moreover, literature has positioned the differentiation of motherhood and fatherhood as a driver of the gender binary. However, this research has focused primarily on cisgender and heterosexual parents or gay/lesbian parents. Non-binary, gender nonconforming, and genderqueer individuals remain a population of parents that social science research has ignored. This work will fill this gap. By studying the attitudes and experiences of individuals who do not identify as strictly male or female, this work will contribute to a greater sociological understanding of gender, parenting, and the binary.",NonBinary,Harvard GNC Parent Study,1567820806.0,"{'created_utc': 1567795606, 'id': 'd0krzh', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 3, 'selftext': '&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Study Information:](https://i.redd.it/j5pxgbrqr0l31.jpg)\n\nThis is a qualitative study that will examine the attitudes and experiences of non-binary, gender nonconforming, and genderqueer parents.

**Stranger:** Are you a guy or a girl btw

**You:** Neither :3

**Stranger:** Oh okay, so I assume trans?

**You:** Yeah so... Trans would kinda fit but I'm Non-Binary/Genderfluid :3

**Stranger:** Okay cool

**Stranger:** How old are you

**You:** (Age) :3

**Stranger:** Okay. So at what point in your life did your know you were non binary?

**You:** I don't know...at one point it was like I was struck by lightning and a voice in my head said ,,You are a boy'' and I thought ,,No I'm not...Wel lyes...No...I am not a girl eather...'' I had fully figured it out at an age of... 11?

**Stranger:** Thats really interesting

**Stranger:** You know i really appreciate your braveness to be who you feel like you are

**You:** Oh thank you \*-\*

***Stranger: But I also have to say I am not a big fan of the 'neither' thing. In my opinion everybody can do and be what and whoever they want as long as they are comfortable with themselves***

***Stranger: But I see gender more like a biological thing, so if I would see myself as a girl for example i would still call myself a boy in a biological sense***

**Stranger:** If you know what i mean

(a very long conversation I just cut out of here)

**Stranger:** But It's such a complex topic

**You:** And exactly this can kill your whole mental health...getting told ,,You are still a boy / girl''

**Stranger:** Dont get me wrong

**You:** No I was meaning it in generall.

**Stranger:** Im really open to everything and I think It's really important that everything is tolerated in society

 **Stranger:** But I think what kills your mental health is not being told youre still a boy or girl, just your own mindset. Just learn not to give a shit about what people except you to be. Accept and love your biological sex but dont let anybody tell you what or who you should like 

 **Stranger:** Just be whoever you want to be. I just think that the biological sex is just a physical thing you cant just ignore 

 **Stranger:** Only physical as I said. Whatever is on your mind is not anyone else business 

&amp;#x200B;

*Guys he was extremly nice an pretty open minded I had fun talking to him :3 and I don't know if you know that ,,fear'' that someone uses the wrong pronouns in your absence so this happened:*

&amp;#x200B;

**Stranger:** Again I totally respect you and I know that It's not easy to cope with a society that can be pretty stuck up at times

**Stranger:** Im bi myself, I dont make a big deal outta it, who gives a shit. Just be whoever you want and feel comfortable with

**You:** Hey can I ask you a favor? If you ever happen to talk about me in any ways...could you use they/them pronouns (or none at all if you talk in German)

**Stranger:** Yeah sure

**You:** You can proably don't imagine how much this means to me....

&amp;#x200B;

*and then there was the BUT again...*

&amp;#x200B;

***Stranger: But again***

***Stranger: I know it means a lot to you but it really shouldnt***

***Stranger: You are making a big deal out of it but I think you should learn (even though it will take time) to stop caring. Otherwise youll just always find yourself being offended, even if the other person doesnt want to offend you in any way***

 ***Stranger: And also, I think you are still pretty young at (Age). Youll grow older and eventually youll be at a point where you dont care about other peoples opinions anymore, and at that point youll be fully comfortable with yourself*** *(Isn't that actually just the:,, it's a phase'' thing .-. and little me felt missunderstood .-.)*

 **You:** Well I don't know if you really understand it but I can tell that you try to 

**Stranger:** I probably cant, youre right

**Stranger:** But I think I can tell you some common stuff that is really important to every person on this planet

**Stranger:** Im probably making a fool out of myself right now I know

**Stranger:** I just try my best to share my view with you and if you think you can make something from it I am happy, if not It's okay too

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr: This guy was amazing. He had his point of view and I had mine, but it was okay! He tried to understand everything and even though I sometimes didn't really got what he meant, I still felt that he didn't want to be offensive.

In my opinion everybody can do and be what and whoever they want as long as they are comfortable with themselves***\n\n***Stranger: But I see gender more like a biological thing, so if I would see myself as a girl for example i would still call myself a boy in a biological sense***\n\n**Stranger:** If you know what i mean\n\n(a very long conversation I just cut out of here)\n\n**Stranger:** But It's such a complex topic\n\n**You:** And exactly this can kill your whole mental health...getting told ,,You are still a boy / girl''\n\n**Stranger:** Dont get me wrong\n\n**You:** No I was meaning it in generall.\n\n**Stranger:** Im really open to everything and I think It's really important that everything is tolerated in society\n\n **Stranger:** But I think what kills your mental health is not being told youre still a boy or girl, just your own mindset. Just learn not to give a shit about what people except you to be. Accept and love your biological sex but dont let anybody tell you what or who you should like \n\n **Stranger:** Just be whoever you want to be. I just think that the biological sex is just a physical thing you cant just ignore \n\n **Stranger:** Only physical as I said. Whatever is on your mind is not anyone else business \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Guys he was extremly nice an pretty open minded I had fun talking to him :3 and I don't know if you know that ,,fear'' that someone uses the wrong pronouns in your absence so this happened:*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Stranger:** Again I totally respect you and I know that It's not easy to cope with a society that can be pretty stuck up at times\n\n**Stranger:** Im bi myself, I dont make a big deal outta it, who gives a shit. Just be whoever you want and feel comfortable with\n\n**You:** Hey can I ask you a favor? If you ever happen to talk about me in any ways...could you use they/them pronouns (or none at all if you talk in German)\n\n**Stranger:** Yeah sure\n\n**You:** You can proably don't imagine how much this means to me....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*and then there was the BUT again...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Stranger: But again***\n\n***Stranger: I know it means a lot to you but it really shouldnt***\n\n***Stranger: You are making a big deal out of it but I think you should learn (even though it will take time) to stop caring. Otherwise youll just always find yourself being offended, even if the other person doesnt want to offend you in any way***\n\n ***Stranger: And also, I think you are still pretty young at (Age). Youll grow older and eventually youll be at a point where you dont care about other peoples opinions anymore, and at that point youll be fully comfortable with yourself*** *(Isn't that actually just the:,, it's a phase'' thing .-. and little me felt missunderstood .-.)*\n\n **You:** Well I don't know if you really understand it but I can tell that you try to \n\n**Stranger:** I probably cant, youre right\n\n**Stranger:** But I think I can tell you some common stuff that is really important to every person on this planet\n\n**Stranger:** Im probably making a fool out of myself right now I know\n\n**Stranger:** I just try my best to share my view with you and if you think you can make something from it I am happy, if not It's okay too\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr: This guy was amazing. He had his point of view and I had mine, but it was okay! He tried to understand everything and even though I sometimes didn't really got what he meant, I still felt that he didn't want to be offensive.\n\n(we ended up exchanging Discord Names :3)"", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'There is always a but (though he was extremly nice!)(Omegle)', 'created': 1567927328.0}"

2. I was definitely a tomboy as a kid. But that doesn’t even matter does it. When I turned 13 and realized I got more attention with makeup I started wearing it. Though I was an attention starved kid.

3. I’m bisexual with a strong preference towards loving women even though I happen to be with a man.

6. I have experience with and love wearing a binder!

me: ...no  
b: so you're a boy?  
m: no  
b: so you're a girl???  
m: NO \*tries to put headphones in\*  
b: are you autistic??  
m: no?!?!   
b: well it seems like you are because you're very rude and not talking to me  
m: i'm sorry i just don't want to talk....

then this next girl comes along, we'll call her chloe  
chloe: so uh do you have a vagina or a... penis..?  
me, already fucking freaking out and having dysphoria attack but i'm too much of a scaredy bitch to actually stop talking: uh-uh-uh a vagina why??  
chloe: well if you have a vajayjay that makes you a girl!11  
me: nononnonon  
bente: do you have boobs  
me: I FUCKING WISH I DIDNT  
bente and the other girl (not chloe) end up getting moved to the front for being loud in an unrelated incident  
chloe starts talking to the people behind me and her about me and it fucking sucks because she keeps saying ""she"" and shit  


this happened a few days ago and i literally wanted to jump out the window and i cried when i got home. i stg i wish i just didn't talk to them. i wish i just said ""fuck off"" or literally anything else. i just wish that this never happened i wish things could be different

Two weeks ago I got my first binder, and when I put it on I instantly felt so much more comfortable in my body. I noticed that I felt a little more masculine after that as well. When I was out in public wearing it, someone referred to me as ""man"" and it made me extremely happy.

2019-09-11 06:08:22,d2ln9f,2,7,"hi!

i've really been struggling with what i feel like i need to do to ease/get rid of my chest dysphoria. i'm really scared about the idea of top surgery because it seems super invasive and i'm worried the scars would be triggering for me. so i thought maybe just a breast reduction would be better, but i'm worried that it wouldn't be enough and i'd still have dysphoria after the reduction because im already only a b cup. i'm also scared that they would grow back a little because i'm 19 (turning 20 soon, and i wouldnt be able to get any surgeries until late next year at the earliest) and i take birth control..... which means extra estrogen! :,\^)

&amp;#x200B;

so i guess my biggest questions from people who have gotten either of the surgeries are:

1. i know this will vary from person to person, but how was the healing process? also as a note: i'm really squeamish, which is why i'm asking this question (to see if i could handle taking care of everything post op) 
2. (i hope this question is okay, its just a big worry i'm having) if you used to selfharm, were the scars from top surgery, specifically, triggering at all?
3. if you got a breast reduction and already had smallish breasts (a-c cup), did they grow back at all? and did you end up wanting top surgery afterwards? 
4. i don't want to wear a binder because i get almost daily breast pain which makes my dysphoria go Wild (easier to notice them when they hurt!!) and i'm worried that the tightness from the binder would make it worse. is there any alternative to ease chest dysphoria until i can figure out what surgery i want to get (and then actually get it)? i thought about sports bras, but i feel like i'd run into the tightness problem there too and they wouldnt flatten my chest enough

2019-09-11 18:17:19,d2ugxv,0,1,"Seven years ago for a brief 6 months I enjoyed a phase of clarity with myself and gender, only to be thrown, rather abruptly back into the sways of a deep depression, that, with the combination of medication, left me bedridden; a zombie in my own skin.

Recently the tides have turned on that front and I have, once again found myself in a place where I am well enough to see past the shroud of self loathing and at myself. As much as I expected the constant dysphoria I experienced with myself and my body to leave with the absence of depression, I instead found some wave of clarity that zoned in on aspects of my body that left me at a loss.

All hit rather abruptly in one moment; trying on lingerie for a partner.

It was a push-up bra that startled me, looking down and seeing real femininity on body and wanting to crawl out of my skin and leave it to die. I stayed wearing it for a minute before the unease was too much and I rid myself of it, shoving it back into the storage space it occupied, behind the baggy clothes that I wear to hide my body.

It really shouldn't have come as much of a surprise considering how many times the sentence had come out of my mouth ""I wish I had a guys body."" With full vigour, hoping after an alternate world where I was a man, knowing full well that in neither world, this or that, could I be happy.

Dreams of being an old person of ambiguous gender, dreams of being post op. The euphoria in the last one was immense when I woke up, only to fade as I realised the truth.

There are more examples but these are primary in my mind right now.

Thus far the need for the support tag is immensely lacking, that will be amended.

I've had a, what others call, 'rough start to life' and I've found that I don't feel I deserve the option of therapy. It may seem weird but, it feels like I've used up all my 'points' for therapy, as if one person is only allowed to have so many issues, I've used all mine and my dysphoria is invalid or not an option, no matter how real and ever present it is.

I guess, more than anything I want to rattle my mind into words and hope that someone will take those words and give me some form of direction to the mess I am right now.

2019-09-11 21:58:48,d2xrzd,10,9,"For reference I am an AMAB. I have only recently (June of this year) admitted to myself that I am indeed transgender.  And although cracking my egg happened only recently, I've been questioning and researching for almost five years.  I mean I've read and read and read so many studies and academic papers.  I've scoured reddit for anecdotal evidence. I've watched trans videos, looked up concepts of gender theory, etc. 

I've been seeing a therapist since mid-February and with her help and my own introspection... I am quite certain I am transgender and an enby.

Do I still question that fact?  Sure I do... constantly and particularly because I identify with being non-binary. 

So, as you might imagine it can be really hard when you are told you're conclusion of being transgender is wrong.... that my five years of research and half a year of therapy is wrong.  

I was talking with a friend recently and she (a transwoman who is not medically or socially transitioning yet except for electrolysis) asked me how I feel about my junk.  For context, we were having a pretty in depth conversation about transitioning, gender, society's perception of trans people, misogyny, passing, etc.  You know... a typical conversation. : )    During that conversation she said she didn't think I was trans because I admitted I experience very little, if any, dysphoria.  Instead, I experience euphoria and elation on being perceived as a woman. I told her I still identify as an enby but I don't feel comfortable expressing gender as androgynous.  So performing gender as a woman is better for me and I love it.

I had no idea my friend was a transmed.  How do you argue against transmedicalists who insist you aren't trans enough because you have little to no dysphoria?   I was hoping some of you would tell me your experience, if any, with dysphoria... or even better with euphoria.  Do any of you experience gender the way I described?... without dysphoria but instead euphoria over being perceived as a gender different from what you were assigned at birth?

Do any of you NOT experience dysphoria or very little?

Then we started talking about gender expression vs gender identity and I was like “my expression is obvious, I want to look fem, but how do I know my gender identity?” She says “do you feel like a man or a woman?” I was like “how the heck am I supposed to know what those feel like inside???”

tl/dr: Enby escapes into conventional presentation during periods of stress, feels immensely guilty about it, shit sucks. Thx.

The long:

AMAB, nonbinary 'officially' for a couple of years, genderbendy for years before that and probably struggling for decades. I'm also old (42 dammit). Started HRT last year and have been ramping up ultra-slowly and happy in a lot of ways with the changes.

But the other day I felt like garbage, was under the weather, got a stomach bug, and on the first day back to work I sorta slunk into flat out boymode because that's my retreat when I got no energy left to cope with the feeling of being exposed and out there, when I'm trying to really push my expression to align with what I feel, which is pretty femme.

It's hard though, because I feel like I'm just slinking back into male privilege, sucking it up, almost always mostly passing. I don't *like* that feeling. I've been holding it for the last few days and trying to understand it, maybe it's internalized binarism, guilt, shame? I dunno, I have to hash this with pshrink but it's not going to be pretty.

I can't go as femme as want all the time, I just can't, I honestly don't have the energy and frankly I'm fat, tall, wide-shouldered and pass as conventionally femme as a refrigerator with a skirt on it.

Gender based body bullshit has already kinda put the nix on me feeling happy being male and kinda the same again as to femme presentation because even if I went full transition (which as much as I want, I also don't want), I would make as awkward and un-celebrated presentation as a woman as I do as a man. Which is sorta the whole point of accepting myself as the non of binaries, but...why does it feel so fuckin' shitty sometimes! Frustrated femme or closeted masc, what do I wanna be?

I have been helping this friend for a few months. I figured out that she was trans before she came out to me (I have family who are trans, and I technically fall under the lable myself). She came out to me because I made it very clear that I would not only be safe, but supportive. She was very relieved. Myself and my partner were the first people she has ever been open with about any of this. She has come out to one other person so far, and I was super proud of her for that! It was very difficult, but she did it!

Now, comes the harder part... the rest of our friend group does not know yet. We know that they would be supportive with changing name/pronouns for her, however, for that to happen, she actually has to come out to them. 

Myself and my partner are the newest additions to the group of friends. I've only really started to get to know this friend in the past year. We're now fairly close, and I'm honored and touched that she felt safe and comfortable to be so open with me about what was a very scary topic for her. I even helped her with picking a new name, and she loves it... but I barely know these other people at all.

Ideally, what she wants me to do is 'accidentally' use her new name around them, in a way that's obviously referring to her. I am not okay with this, because I am so new to the friend group. Some of these people, she's known since early childhood. I'm worried that it will be seen as 'why couldn't you just tell is yourself' and 'why were you okay coming out to them and not us?'. It really seems to me like a nasty way of finding out, trying to see it from the other friends' perspective. 

I've already told her twice that I am not okay doing this, it feels like a bad way to come out to people who you've known for so many years. I've said that I would gladly be there for her if she is ready to come out to them, and I would even give her prompts in the conversation to help, but coming out should really come from her.

2019-09-13 03:38:12,d3jee2,5,6,"Hello all, I searched the archives and didn't see an answer to my question so apologies in advance if this has been asked and answered before.

I'm an asexual binary trans woman and a group I'm a part of is changing the language in their bylaws to be more inclusive. For example, they are changing instances of words like committeeman to committeeperson, replacing the word ""sex"" with ""gender identity"", instances of ""men and women"" are being replaced with ""people"", etc.

One old rule this club has is that if the President of the group is a man, the Vice President has to be a woman. The original language was something to the effect of, ""The vice chair must be the opposite sex of the chair"". I'm sure they did this for diversity purposes when the group was formed but they still want to make sure that both positions aren't taken by men. They suggested changing the language to ""The vice chair must be of a different gender than the chair"" which was then updated again to say, ""The vice char must be of a different gender identity than the chair"". 

Here's the issue. People are looking to me to make sure this is properly inclusive language because I'm trans. But I also know that people who are agender don't identify as having a particular gender or gender identity. I asked a couple of my non binary friends about this but they don't identify as agender and weren't quite sure.

When emailing people, I have to decide whether it is safe or “worth it” to identify myself as non-binary. While I live in a very progressive place I do worry that outing myself could effect my chances of getting housing. I try to avoid the subject all together, but many people are looking for specifically male or female roommates.

I hope you are all doing well. I also hope it is appropriate to post here and ask a question as a person who wouldn’t typically frequent this sub, but please have this post removed of it is not.

I ask this question out of a desire to better understand and to be more informed so I hope it doesn’t come across as challenging in any way. In fact I write it with the hope that you can challenge and enlighten me. I will try to word it as best I can.

So I am trying to understand why a person who is physically male or female in sex (I guess excluding other scenarios for now to simplify the question) and who feels that they enjoy things or have aspects in their personality that are typically categorised as belonging to the other sex, would consider that being referred to in a non-binary way is the most applicable solution to the stereotypes? For me, it seems like an admittance and almost a validation of the stereotypes belonging to words “he” or “she”, etc. My own thoughts are that he stereotypes should be challenged rather than the words.

This is a mess of words because I'm not doing so great today. I'm just over three months in.

My dysphoria is at an all time high. Not only am I still this bald, blobby, huge-hipped, 38F disaster human... now I'm not even objectively attractive and my period is back Every Single Week after not having one for three years. I want to rip my insides out, and the doc just said to take some pain meds like that fixes the problem.

At least I used to be cute.

What if I go through all of this and want to go back.

What if all I need is top and masculinization surgery to be happy and all this hormone mess is unecessary.

What if coming out to everyone was unecessary.

I'm anxious and depressed and violently dysphoric.

Why am I not having the euphoria that I see so much in trans subs. I'm not happy. I'm in mental and physical pain. I don't like this at all.

My voice is dropping. That's nice. But I'm greasy and stinky and all that is connecting itself to the period pains in my head which is making it another dysphoria source. I shower and scrub and put on new clothes... and ten minutes later my pants smell like something died.

What if I'm just a lesbian and this is all stupid. No matter that I'm married to a mildly-masc amab enby and don't want that to change. What if we got a girlfriend and all my dysphoria poofed.

What if what if what if. I'll what if myself to death. I also feel like I'm just typing all the ""right things"" to get affirmative answers from you guys. I have horrible imposters syndrome.

This stress brain is compounded by my partner being in grad school, newly chronically ill, and me not having the spell slots to deal with any of this. I don't know how to cope in a healthy manner, and the only therapist I have found that doesn't make my imposters syndrome worse costs $100 a session, and I dont have that kind of money.

Right now I’m willing to “play the game” by accepting that I may need to “pass” as a trans man, or a butch woman, but it’s all very up in the air and frankly I’m scared. I want this future and I’m willing to fight for it, but any guidance or advice would be greatly appreciated. \n\n(I also hope this is the appropriate place/flair for this post, I’m not super active on reddit)', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Academia and NB Transness— Advice/Experience?', 'created': 1568417739.0}"

My name is Louis Lindley (he/him) and I am queer transmasculine researcher with Towson University.

We are conducting a research study examining transgender and non-binary individuals’ engagement with sexual activities. We want to make sure that the literature on transgender sexual engagement is rooted in the actual lived experiences of transgender individuals and to do this we need your help. The survey will take between 20-30 minutes and will ask about your engagement with various sexual activities. 

**If you are interested, please visit** [**https://tinyurl.com/yxj856n8**](https://tinyurl.com/yxj856n8)

Participation is completely voluntary, and your answers will remain anonymous. 

If you have any questions or comments please email me at [llindl1@students.towson.edu](mailto:llindl1@students.towson.edu) or my advisor, Dr. M. Paz Galupo (she/her or they/them), at [pgalupo@towson.edu](mailto:pgalupo@towson.edu) 

**Transgender Research Informed Consent (TRICON) Disclosure Policy:**

**Objective:** The objective is to gain a better understanding of how gender expectations, gender dysphoria, and body satisfaction may or may not interact to impact levels of sexual satisfaction. The results of this study will help to inform clinicians who work with transgender and non-binary clients to improve their sexual satisfaction.

**Primary Investigator:** The co-PI’s are Louis Lindley (graduate student at Towson University) and Annalisa Anzani (Doctoral Student at University of Milano – Bicocca) who are being supervised by Dr. M. Paz Galupo (professor at Towson University)

**Trans Involvement:** Louis Lindley is a queer transman. Due to the inclusion of questions about sexual activities; we sought the feedback and suggestions of other transgender researchers while creating the survey to ensure the survey was affirming and would not be unnecessarily triggering. 

**Sponsoring Institution/Funding:** This project is not funded nor are there any sponsoring institutions or organizations.

**Institutional Review Board:** The IRB at Towson University approved this study.

**Target population:** Any individual over the age of 18 who identifies as non-binary, transgender, or with a transgender history is asked to participate in this study. As always, we hope to have a diverse sample in terms of race and SES and will do targeted sampling if necessary, to insure we are not only reporting on the experiences of white, middle to upper class trans or non-binary individuals. While we include participants from all over the world, the survey is only available in English. 

**Compensation:** There is no cost to participant in the study nor are there any travel requirements. There is no compensation for participating in the study. 

**Accessing Results:** The result of this study will be published in a peer reviewed journal. While we cannot guarantee that the article will be open access, we will post an accessible link to Louis Lindley’s research gate once it is accepted and published.",NonBinary,"Participants need for trans and non-binary affirming, sexual engagement study!",1568430979.0,"{'created_utc': 1568405779, 'id': 'd3uxvx', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 9, 'selftext': '  \n\n![img](8tps81ek4fm31)\n\nMy name is Louis Lindley (he/him) and I am queer transmasculine researcher with Towson University.\n\nWe are conducting a research study examining transgender and non-binary individuals’ engagement with sexual activities.

2019-09-13 20:50:35,d3veri,12,7,"So,
I’ve thought this for a while,
But basically, I’ve taken sociology classes and anthropology in university, and both say the same thing about gender and sex, gender being the human-made social construct of your identity while sex is your biological features. People in different cultures have diverse gender identities such as recognizing two genders, three, five, or even an innumerable amount. And people are born intersex - with genitals being a combination of the sexes. 
From that, we can see culturally that ‘gender’ is the social term we identify as, and sex manifests on a spectrum (it is not binary, just as anything in nature, things occur on a frequency of bell-curve where variations all along the natural biological range of sexes).
And it’s also commonly asserted now that toys, clothing, makeup, working industries, sports, hobbies, etc. DO NOT have a gender association; anyone can like anything and ‘gender’ cannot restrict or qualify what you’re allowed to like and do. 
With all of that background, I feel like even the definitions of femininity and masculinity are rendered moot and outdated, because you can’t categorize these gender identities as only one being ‘strong’ or ‘emotionally-intelligent’ or ‘intuitive’ or whatever other human attribute. Anyone can have these kind of attributes regardless of what they’re gender identity is. 
So for me, I don’t really believe gender is a term that has any meaning. We can talk biologically about people’s sex, because that is a tangible and natural occurrence, but gender is a construct. 
It’s not real.
So I have no understanding of what people really mean when they say they feel more feminine or more masculine, because to me I feel as though regardless of how you identify in that way, you’re just a person and those constraints on your identity have no true meaning.
I’m interested to hear other people’s thoughts on this!!

2019-09-15 01:22:38,d4e1jd,0,3,"Tl;dr at bottom

Back when I first began questioning my gender identity, I questioned my own name, too. I wondered whether it was too ‘girly’ and why I was even opposed to the thought of being girly in the first place.

For awhile, I wanted something new to describe who I was. I ended up creating a name for myself, which I used in the occasional place online, that consisted of both a more traditionally masculine name, and a more traditionally feminine name.

Once I came to terms with being nonbinary (demigirl specifically), I abandoned the created name. I never had anyone I knew in real life call me by it anyways, so it was easy to leave behind. After all, figuring out that I wasn’t a cis girl explained a lot of things for me, and why I never liked the idea of being a ‘girly’ girl and hated pink (even tho its a perfectly valid color!!), even when I wasn’t the most tomboyish as a kid. (I was in a pretty good place in the middle, to be fair.) 

My attachment to my birth name has also grown in recent years, from moving away to my slightly childish nickname (mostly an anxiety thing, I’ve always embraced my childish side) to almost completely leaving the nickname behind due to finding out the reason behind it not being something you might actually get from my name and for it not being spelled traditionally, either. (Was created by my father, he is a narcissist and of course it had to be all about him.)

Along with changing the spelling of my nickname to the traditional form and restricting its use to family members/very close childhood friends who have called me it my entire life, I’ve also reverted to the traditional pronunciation of my birth name among certain people. My father’s family refused to pronounce it the way the Italian (mother’s family is Italian) name is supposed to be pronounced because ‘it doesn’t look like that’, so my mom gave in and let it be changed (she gave in a lot when it came to my name - my dad didn’t like her other ideas and she was just trying to keep peace in letting him make my nickname the way it is). 

I’ve also toyed with the idea of a new nickname of my own choosing/one my friend helped me come up with that I’ve thought about using at school and with friends. 

Anyways, point is I’ve dealt with a lot of name changing recently and while I haven’t completely permanently changed anything yet, and this was just another instance of new names around certain people.

My friend’s boyfriend knows the story behind the pronunciation of my first name, and it kinda confuses him, so he’s taken to calling me Abe. Today, I was randomly thinking about the old name I’d created for myself, and I texted him to tell him that if he insists on calling me by a guy’s name as a joke, call me by the one I used to use online, I won’t get as jokingly annoyed 😂 He said he’d think about it. (Have his number cuz he’s DMing a DnD group I’m in with one of my close friends, his girlfriend.)

I’d never shared that name with anyone else before, but I’ve been trying out new names and nicknames and combinations a lot recently, so I decided to hell with it, I’m gonna have someone start calling me that and we’ll see how I feel about it. And it turns out I’m feeling pretty happy with it so far.

Tl;dr: 

Lots of name stuff/new knowledge behind it has had me toying with new nicknames/versions of my name recently, and I gave one friend who jokingly calls me “Abe” (bc of confusion surrounding my actual name) an old created name I used for myself online back when I was first realizing that I’m nonbinary to use as a joking male name for me (gave him the first half of it, the traditionally male bit, but the name is a male name and female name together like a first and middle name.)",NonBinary,"When I first started questioning my gender identity, I created a name both masculine and feminine for myself, which I used online.

So I’m AFAB and I identified as genderfluid from 2014 up until a few months ago. The change came from the fact that I realized I don’t feel like a woman at all- it’s like that side of me is just completely gone.

I’m fine with this! So I recently came out to everyone as a non-binary trans man. This seems very fitting. However, I’m wondering if there is a label that sort of encompasses me better.

What non-binary phrases are there that I could explore? My gender seems to go to third gender, man,  and “f*ck gender” the most. My gender expression however is an amalgamation of very feminine, very masculine, and androgynous.

Are there terms that seem to fit how I exist? I’m curious because I desperately want to find a label that fits me. So if there are any that sound like me, I’d appreciate it very much!

I love football. I've always loved football. I wear a Patriots shirt every Sunday during the season. Today, I'm at a new bar, shooting shit, drinking Bloody Marys and having a good time. The guy next to me and I hit it off and we continue chatting sporadically throughout the game. He's impressed by my knowledge of football, invites me to his place to ""watch the next game"" and I accept. We go to his neighbor's, watch ball there, head back to his place to get more intimate and after I flip him after having me pinned, he asks... ""Wait... you're not a dude, right?""

I froze. I got off of him. I was in a state of shock I've never been in before. I'm proudly out as bi, but my gender is more of my own subject at the moment. The wave of hatred as ""you're femme presenting but know about sports so  you must be trans"" hurt. The "" you're a \~lady\~ but are obvs masc enough to be a ""man"" which makes this ""\~gay\~"" hurts. Being semi-clocked was the most painful, hurtful thing I could have imagined. This was **not** flattering. This **WAS** transphobic.

**MY GENDER IS MY GENDER**. THERE ARE MOMENTS I LOVE IT AND MOMENTS I HATE IT. But you, *cishet of all cishets*, don't get to make me feel like this. You see my masc (the few among many) and disown me for it because your own masculinity is so fragile. My femme means nothing and my femme means EVERYTHING. I am raging. I am hurting. I am mad. I am sad.  I am so fucking rattled that I don't know which way is up. But that being said: Fuck you, transphobic piece of shit. I was living my best life. My football team won. My jersey has never fit me because of my physical build. I AM STILL QUEER. 

My passion for football is not my gender. My lack of makeup is not my gender. My orientation is not my gender. IF YOU'RE INTO ME, THEN BE INTO ME. If I'm too ""one of the guys"" for you, don't bring me home. If I'm not high-femme babe enough for you, don't bring me home. But if you can have a good time with me for 3 hours, chill for a minute more, then freak out when you've got *a bad bitch who knows what's up* about to ride you like ANYTHING... YOU'RE GONE. 

This has never happened to me before. I've never felt it. Dysphoria rears its head but mainly is kept in check (and has very fortunately never happened in a sexual encounter...prior to this.). I'm bi. I'm queer. And suddenly, I'm (more than my usual dose of ) unsettled by dating cishet men. Today was hard. Tonight will be hard. And I am so very lost.

\[I'd love to hear about your story, thank you very much in advance if you decide to share\]

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my experience if you're interested:

I've been questioning my gender for over a year now and I've still not quite figured it out.

I've been thinking I might be ***non binary*** and ***genderfluid***, but I'm still not sure.

* I'm ***AFAB*** and I don't feel legitimate as I feel like my gender *fluctuates*, I happen to feel ""*woman-ly***""** and *nb*, or something else than ""*woman*"" as in a ""*gray area*"". (I had a point where I thought I was *bigender*, more specifically *bigirl*, but saying *bigirl* gives the girl part too much attention, which doesn't feel as right as it used to)
* I would not feel comfortable with ""he/him"" pronouns. But I do with ***she/her*** and ***they/them*** pronouns. Although, I really dislike to be referred to ""madam"" or such things.
* I deeply reject social gender norms as well, but I don't know if it's because I'm deconstructing myself from social constructs or because it's on a personal level.
* The same goes for the clothes I wear, I like clothes from the men's and women's section. I sometimes like to wear one more than the other, it fluctuates.
* I also like to have body hair and not shave them which makes me feel good and less ""woman-ly"" (as in the social stereotype and norm for women), and more me? like ""damn I don't look \*stereotypically or typically to disgusting social norms\* like a woman""
* I used to ""defend"" nb people, and it'd hurt when they would get misgendered or invalidated by others. However, now it hurts me on an another level. Personal level.

When I talk about it I'm feeling very good and authentic. Then when I don't talk about it, I feel like it's all a lie? and I feel weird? **Especially** after talking about it with close-friends as they don't know much about it all... 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm genderqueer, I'm queer. I'll say that so I don't have to put any gender or anything on it whilst figuring it all out. Talking about it now, I'd say I'm NB. Ugh.

Someone accidentally referring to me as ""them"", reading a book with a non-binary character, following nb people on internet, talking about it to a couple of people around me, and Sam Smith coming out as non binary pushed me to talk about trying they/them pronouns to my close friends. And questioning my gender even more.

&amp;#x200B;

2019-09-16 23:07:09,d58all,6,2,"     Hi, as you can tell by the title, I am interested in hormonally transitioning. However, given that I am non-binary I am not necessarily looking for the conventional FTM transition. I’ve had gender dysphoria for years now (basically ever since puberty) and in the past thought that I would probably end up identifying as male. The issue with that though is that i’ve always felt connected to femininity, and love dressing and presenting in a feminine way when I feel like it. My dysphoria sorta phases in and out. I’ll go for pretty long periods of time where I feel fine with people assuming i’m a girl, and I’ll actually feel mostly ok with my body, and feel like maybe i’d be fine if i didn’t transition (i’ll still want to). Then the dysphoria comes back very badly and I’ll have to bind and present in a more masculine way. I have a connection to womanhood and love dressing in a feminine way and using makeup, but still have gender dysphoria and desire to be read as male. But I also do not want to swing too far into the male-esque side of the pendulum. So, with that said here are some of my questions and concerns. 

• Are there options when it comes to hormonal transition that won’t completely masculinize me? 
• I am concerned that if I see a gender therapist, or if I go through the screening process in order to get treatment for transitioning, the fact that I don’t always like to present as male will cause me to not be taken seriously. Does anyone have experience with this?
• In the case that I can’t receive hormone treatment because of my unconventionality, is there a way to significantly masculinize my hormonal balance without a prescription?

2019-09-17 21:49:47,d5ntho,5,3,"Okay so I’m a lesbian. Of that I am sure. Girl hot. When it comes to gender, I’m less sure. Or I might be. I don’t know. 

So I’ve identified as a lesbian for 6/7 years now (isn’t it scary, the passage of time?) and I am really comfortable with that. It feels right. It’s an important part of my identity. About 4 years ago I started to feel a little unsure about my gender (for context I’m afab. Am I still f? Who knows?). I’m definitely not a man but I’m not quite (?) a woman but I’m also not completely unrelated to being a woman but also I might be but also what the fuck is going on. I started to look into being non binary and even going by they/them and gender neutral names (the names didn’tfit me at all but like I was more focused on the gender neutral-ness at the time) online however eventually I stopped. I’d thought about several nb identies like demigirl or agender or genderfluid and I wasn’t sure any felt right and it all kind of stressed me out and also, and possible most importantly, I didnt want to not be a lesbian, because that was (and still is) so right for me. So I kind of pushed it aside and stopped myself from thinking about it because I figured if I wanted to keep the lesbian identity I felt so comfortable in I HAD to be a girl. 

More recently I discovered that non binary lesbians are actually a thing and like that was an interesting discovery that has kind of upheaved my entire perception on my gender so that’s fun. So now I’m thinking about my gender again and like? I don’t know. Except maybe I do???

When I think about gender, the first thought I have is always something like “well why are you asking me I don’t know” (that’s me to myself my thought process is weird) or some kind of gender joke like “my gender is goth” or “my gender is *loud truck drives past” or something like that. I feel like there’s a lot of confusion but apathy towards that confusion. Like my attitude to gender is “who knows who cares girls are pretty”. Like it almost feels like lesbian could be my gender too if that makes any sense. Like the only way I am connected to gender at all is that I’m a lesbian. 

Also I don’t know where to put this in the structure of this post but it was my birthday yesterday and I got a card from my grandma addressed to “Miss [my name]” and I think I physically grimaced. It was also pink and florally inside but that’s less a gender thing and more a “my grandmother has no idea who I am as a person”. That’s important because it’s the first time I’ve noticed myself being uncomfortable referred to that way. Like I’ve noticed a dislike of some gendered words but that’s the first time I’ve noticed I’ve disliked it being used towards me and linked it to whatever the fuck is going on with my gender (probably because we’d just been talking about Sam Smith. Won’t dwell on that conversation but let’s just say if I am nb I won’t be coming out to my brother. :/ Though I wasn’t gonna be doing that about the lesbian part anyway) so now I’m like oh.

There’s more things that just add to things as well.  It’s become a thing to put pronouns in social media descriptions, especially if you’re cis so it’s normalised, and all my friends (okay my one friend and all her friends who I’ve kinda just adopted) do it but I don’t because I’m not sure. It doesn’t feel right to put she/her in my description. I’m not sure it feels like me.  Im not sure enough to put they/them in my description. I also don’t relate to many people’s experiences of being a woman? Like I wish I could explain that better but women will be talking about their experiences being a woman and I’ll be like hmm don’t relate at all. I also tend to gravitate towards characters in things that don’t seem to give a shit about gender and stuff like that

I don’t know if you’ve noticed reading this but i feel like my uncertainty may be less about whether or not I’m non binary or whether or not I want to admit I’m non binary. Like I feel like I could easily in a few years look back at this and be like “how did you think you were a cis woman you dumbass” but also at the same time I don’t feel sure. Maybe it’s because I’m not nb maybe it’s because to me it feels like a big step to say I am. I haven’t come out as lesbian to many people at all (I could literally count on one hand) and I’m starting to wonder if it’s because I feel like I’m not finished figuring out who I am.

2019-09-18 19:54:31,d63798,16,9,"Hi there!

So, I'm in a bit of a difficult situation at the moment. I spend a lot of time in trans spaces  and I'm very femme presenting. One of the reasons I started spending time almost exclusively in trans spaces is in queer spaces I get assumed to be a cis woman and I get hit on by lesbians. I generally tell those lesbians I'm NB and they tell me I'm within their sexuality because for them lesbian means attraction to non-men. 

This made me incredibly dysphoric because to me I'm essentially being told I'm 'close enough' to a woman that they can ignore my identity. Like, no, you're a lesbian, I'm not a woman. At all. we aren't compatible. You don't get to force me into a binary (men and non-men) when I just told you I'm done with that.

Now I'm in trans spaces more or less exclusively cause I thought I could get away from that, but now it's happening with NB lesbians. I really want to trust that they view me as my gender, but I still can't help but feel like I'm being told I'm 'close enough' which feels totally dehumanizing. It feels like I'm having my gender taken away by other non-binary people. I guess my main issue is I can't understand why someone would identify with the woman-loving sexuality if they don't see the people they date as women? It makes me think I'm being given 2 pieces of contradictory information.

So, I'm genuinely sorry if I offended at all, I certainly don't mean to would be happy to receive feedback on anything I said badly. I really want to be more comfortable around NB lesbians, and would so appreciate thoughts on how I could think about non-binary lesbians differently. I'd also really appreciate if any NB lesbians who are willing to share could explain why they ID with their sexuality and how it interacts with their gender.

2019-09-18 20:04:38,d63cgu,4,6,"Hey the wonderful people of r/nonbinary, I have a question. I'm 16 AMAB and around 75% sure I'm genderfluid. I realized this last Friday and I'm still trying to figure out everything. Transitioning is a major part of being trans, so I was wondering what options there are for genderfluid Peeps? For me at least, I'm not really uncomfortable with being male, my genitals, being called my birth name, ECT, but a part of me want boobs and to be a masc punk girl.

2019-09-19 07:17:29,d6aiu9,5,15,"Hello Everyone,

(I will try to make this as short and quick as possible)

This is my first time posting here. Im a mid 20s ""female"" living in Dubai. Both my parents are conservative Muslims (however they are not extremists so its not THAT bad). I first realized i was bisexual by the age of 15-16 and confirmed that i was a lesbian at age 18. Now that I am in my mid 20s in a serious relationship with perhaps the most wonderful person i have come across, i am starting to focus on things i used to sweep under the rug.

My partner, a late 20s pan female, has introduced me into the path of self love and self acceptance and has always given me unconditional love and support. Because of that, I am no longer sweeping things under the rug and instead learning to deal with them. My father beat me up really bad and locked me in my room for one week without food just water when he found out I was a lesbian. (i was 17y/o &amp; a year away from graduating high school and my ex-gf's mom outed us). I had no choice but to come out to my mother(my parents have been divorced since i was 14) she held me as i cried and told me ""this is a mistake this is disgusting, god will punish you, just dont repeat it again and everything will be fine""

Fast forward to 8 years later. Im working, im independent and have a very limited and minimal relationship with both my mother and father. I have not cut them out completely but i have put boundaries that they often break and i have to pull back. I sleep mostly in hotels or with my gf since we are moving out in November or when i am really trying to save more money i stay at my mother's house but dont communicate unless she speaks to me. My parents are still assholes if not bigger assholes than before, my father i dont talk to anymore and after so many years finally had the courage to block him on social media. my mother started hitting me again every now and then when she gets in her mood. The point is right now, i am happy with who i am, im slowly learning to be more and more confident and i am learning to put my foot down. I can say this is the best i have ever been since i was 14 and thats a little over a decade ago. 

My issue is, it took me my whole life a lot of fighting a lot of blood sweat and tears (literally, 2 suicide attempts, alcohol dependency, drug addiction, self-harm, sexual assault) to be where i am and say i am an atheist and a lesbian to my family and not giving two fucks about their reaction or opinions of me, basically being true to myself. But deep down i dont feel like a ""woman"". Sometimes i fantasize about being a man and i think mostly because women dont get much in my society, culture, religion and country. So i dont know if when i feel like i am truly a man if its a way of escaping the shit in my life or if thats truly how i feel. Then, i dont feel like a man or a woman, i just feel like me. Pronouns never affected me but male pronouns did sexually excite me and sometimes make me feel warm inside and my partner sometimes calls me her boyfriend and it makes me happy. But i dont know if thats who i really am. I dont feel like a man or a woman and this is harder because i feel all this fighting and hurt ive been through with society and my family was for nothing if thats the case. I know it wasnt, but i cant help the irrational feeling inside of me. How do i know what i am? how can i settle this? its driving me insane and slowly down the rabbit hole that took me so long to come out of.

2019-09-19 13:20:04,d6dy4i,6,10,"Throwaway because I'm a coward.

I've identified as male all my life. I have a bi cis-female wife in a happy marriage with a child. I have a beard and I like how I look with it. I have never experienced dysphoria about my body.

But dammit, I want to be PRETTY. I wanted Lee Press-On Nails as a kid. Still kinda do. I loved wearing makeup for drama in high school, and I felt more real being someone else rather than being myself. Eye makeup would just make me feel beautiful. Sometimes I feel like I identify more with female characters in fiction than male. I enjoy playing female characters in RPGs, and even did it a couple of times in tabletop and online games. One friend said ""when I'm playing with you, I forget you're a guy.""

Also, I love the word ""enby."" It's cute. It's a much less daunting word than ""non-binary,"" and less scary to me than ""genderqueer."" Maybe the word makes things less scary. 

What's my deal? 

* Do I just dislike some traditionally male norms and like some traditionally female norms? 
* Do I just want to feel special because being a cis-het white male makes me feel bland and boring? Am I appropriating terms from this community to that end?
* Is it wrong that I have nothing wrong with using ""he/him"" pronouns, but become daunted that the moderators flair is almost universally they/them? 
* Do I resist this concept because I'm in a public-facing profession where changing any gender expression would be disastrous? 
* Would accepting this identity make me less of an effective advocate than being a cis-het white guy does? Is it wrong that I experience guilt over this concept?

I don't know, and I have no idea where to start asking questions other than here. I'm even a little scared to ask my wife (who, bless her soul, would have no problem with it).

2019-09-19 15:03:18,d6fali,3,27,"Tl;dr: My experience being raised as gender-free as possible and how that turned out. 

After having seen that a story I shared about my trans-accepting grandma had brightened some people's days, I have decided to share with you folk how my parents raised me as gender-free as possible. I know I have the privilege of having a very forward-thinking and accepting family, and that not everybody does, but I do hope sharing this story can give people insight into what families can be like, both now and in the future. 

When I came out as nb to my father about a month ago, he said he had always known, in a way. In fact, though he is not extremely well-versed on LGBTQ+ lingo, he said something that really stuck with me: that him and my mom tried to raise me as free from gender restrictions as possible. They acknowledged and taught me that society has ""boys"" and ""girls"", but also that people don't have to exclusively be either. They never negated biological differences, but rather taught me that they were merely that: chromosomes being expressed, nothing more. 

I was born in 1999 in Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil, so neither the worst nor the best place and time for trans issues. I was assigned female at birth and, like many of you growing up, never felt comfortable conforming to either gender on the binary. The thing that made a huge difference, though, is that my parents never held that against me. They respected that I chose my own clothes, toys, and they actively tried to not ""gender"" said activities (e.g. saying that playing with dolls was only for girls, etc.). Even when I referred to myself with different pronouns (sometimes female, sometimes male), they still respected and validated my choices from as early on as I can remember. It was never a ""big deal"", I just existed and that was that. They never said things such as ""that's just a phase"" or ""you are just confused"", etc. Now I know that that was an active choice of theirs to allow me to be myself, and that they always have and will love me for myself. They more often than not used the nickname ""cub"" (""filhote"" in Portuguese) for me (I have commented on that before, I think) instead of ""filha"" or ""filho"" (daughter and son, respectively), and now dad has explained to me why.  As a result, I didn't struggle with gender disforia as much as I probably would have if I hadn't had such a chill and loving environment, and I feel accepted and loved by my family.

I am so privileged and thankful for having a family that  tried their best (we all make mistakes along the way, but still) to let me just be myself, loving me no matter what. Now I wish to pass that on to my children someday, and hopefully inspire a few of you to do the same. Remember, love is one of the few things that you can give as much as you want, and you will still never have less of it. 

An anecdote: when I was 2, I got a baby doll from a family friend for my birthday. The doll had xy parts, but I decided that my doll was a girl. My parents used that situation to teach me that, indeed, some people are born with bodies that differ from how they identify, and they are just like everyone else. Looking back, it was a great teachable moment, especially considering that Bebeca (how I named her) was my favourite doll in the world. The rest of my family were also cool with all of that, and some of my fondest memories of my childhood are of me learning how to sew by helping my grandma (not the one I previously mentioned) make clothes for Bebeca - dresses, skirts, trousers, everything.",NonBinary,"Sorry for the long post, but I hope it can inspire someone",1568930598.0,"{'created_utc': 1568905398, 'id': 'd6fali', 'num_comments': 3, 'score': 27, 'selftext': 'Tl;dr: My experience being raised as gender-free as possible and how that turned out. \n\nAfter having seen that a story I shared about my trans-accepting grandma had brightened some people\'s days, I have decided to share with you folk how my parents raised me as gender-free as possible.

I got a message this morning from her checking out on me and i mentioned there are some changes happening in my life and i who i am, i didn't know how to explain what i am with words and i sent her the picture i posted here the other day with my first/new dress and makeup on. 

Her answer was
 ""There is nothing to explain because you is you and i admire you alot because you are special to me, you don't have to be scared as you didn't hurt anyone (i mentioned i was worried about talking with my parents), you have to feel good on the inside. You'll see everything is going to be all right.

2019-09-19 21:06:58,d6kc5w,3,7,"Hi

So I'm currently a student in college, and it's been going pretty well! Catch is, this is the first time I've really been in any kind of social place since I realised that I'm not cis. I've been considering coming out, but haven't really been too motivated to do it. I'm nonbinary genderfluid, and typically don't mind being referred to with my birth gender- I do use the pronouns associated with it sometimes, so that doesn't cause me dysphoria.

However, in sociology we have begun to study gender roles. The topic is pretty interesting, but the catch is that, obviously, our personal gender comes up frequently. At first I was fine with it, but the more it happened the worse I felt, and I couldn't focus at all in the last 15 minutes of the class. It was the last class of the day so I was able to calm down, but it's left me with a problem.

I'm considering coming out to my sociology teacher, so that he knows not to gender me in class, but I'm very nervous about it. Where I live isn't conservative, but most people are pretty oblivious to anything LGBT+. I don't know if he even knows what nonbinary or genderfluid mean, and I don't know if I would be comfortable explaining it.

I've decided to wait until my next sociology class on Monday to decide what to do so I can think things through properly, but I guess I'd just like some advice, if anyone has any? I don't think that coming out would put me in danger, but I also don't know if I'm really ready to deal with what could come with coming out. I don't know any other trans people at the college either, so there's no one like that who I can go to for advice.

2019-09-19 22:44:17,d6ln4h,6,6,"It's going to be a long one and I've never talked about this with anyone (just a month ago, thinking about it gave me a panic attack), so sorry in advance, and thanks for reading 💜

So, for context, I'm AFAB and I've always been a bit of a tomboy, but I come from a traditional family so I ended up presenting very femme when I started puberty. Society got into my brain too, it told me that I had to be feminine, show my curves, wear a cleavage, long hair, makeup, etc. Y'all know the deal. And so I did. Until this summer (I'm 24), after a very bad relationship and breakup, I realized that my appearance has never been my own. With the years, I've tried to go back to the tomboyish look, but only enough so that I wouldn't be judged. 

Here's where the gender thing comes in. My country is pretty traditional, I only learned what non-binary meant a couple years ago. And I've always questioned my relationship with gender, but never consciously till now. Until this summer, I just felt bad because even though I didn't want to be a boy, I felt as though the ""girl"" label wasn't right. And people told me that I'm just more masculine, tomboy, or a lesbian (?), etc. 

Regarding my body, I always wore my brother's clothes, and boy's swimsuits when I was a child (I live in a pretty hot country), and it took a lot of convincing for me to wear a bikini, and even then, I refused to wear the top part of it. When I went into puberty and had to wear the top, it was very dramatic for me. Bras were also very dramatic, so I started wearing sport bras that made me flatter. And still nowadays, I tend to go for a flatter look. I also tend to like pants that make me less ""curvy"". 

And the most dramatic part of it all, and where all of this comes from: my hair. I've worn it very long for years, but I always wear it up because I don't like it. I've been wanting to cut it for years, but I'm always told that ""it's too pretty"" or that I'll lose my sex appeal or whatever. And this summer, I kind of decided to do it (still haven't done it yet, I'm too afraid in case I actually lose the one thing that's pretty about me). 

Basically all this time I've been dressing femme for other people, wearing long hair for other people, acting more ladylike for other people. And for years I've thought that this ""girl"" label doesn't fit, but I don't feel non-binary enough, as if I don't fit the criteria. As if I'm just a masculine girl who doesn't like traditional gender roles, and that's it. Because even though I don't like the girl label, I don't really have dysphoria (apart from wanting to be flatter and less curvy, but I solve that with clothes and not looking at myself in the mirror that much), I don't care about she/her pronouns, I'm okay with my private parts... I basically feel like I'm underestimating people who are actually trans or actually enby.

2019-09-20 05:07:39,d6q3gw,0,9,"Gender. The final frontier. These are the voyages of SaintRidley. Their mission: fuck if anyone knows. Does it really matter? What the hell am I doing here?

Yeah. That’s sort of the gist of how my brain is dealing with the question. I’m AMAB and I sure look it. I’m hairy, I have been heavily socialized as male. So naturally, it seemed simple. I was a boy. I think the doubt that it was so simple began creeping into the back of my head as a result of two minor things, about 7 years ago. I had already been wearing women’s clothes and getting my wife to help me with makeup annually around Halloween during college, but she asked a question around the start of grad school when I bought my first pair of thigh high boots: “Are you sure you’re not trans?” I answered quickly and, for the time, honestly with a simple no.

Around this same time the other minor thing happened. I was chatting with a friend on facebook, and she was trying to understand the attachment some people have toward certain pronouns. She explained that she didn’t have a very strong identification with feminine pronouns, and that she didn’t really have a very strong attachment to or clear idea of what it even meant to “be a woman.” In chatting with her, I realized that I never really gave it a lot of thought myself and I wasn’t very different. I always just kind of defaulted into working with masculine pronouns. I never really felt comfortable with what seemed to be the generally agreed upon idea of what it meant to “be a man.” I was just like, “Yeah, I’m a guy, I guess.”

All disclaimers about egg discourse being problematic in effect, but I can definitely think back to some definite cracks in the shell from about as long ago as I can remember. Lots of them, too many to go into detail here. A small one, but perhaps a bit more telling than I ever imagined it, is how I come up wth D&amp;D characters. I have never once felt any significant attachment to any male-identifying character I have created. And while my favorite characters I’ve created and been able to play have been women, the ones I pour the most effort into creating are those with no or unstable gender. Give me the opportunity to play a Warforged (magic robot) or a Changeling and I won’t play anything else, because then I don’t have to deal with being stuck on the binary. I’ll make a Warforged pro wrestler character whose catchphrase is “To be the nongendered entity, you gotta beat the nongendered entity! And I am the nongendered entity.” Give me a Changeling and I’ll have about half a dozen different personas of various genders for them to work with because I won’t be stable along a binary. That’s what always appealed to me about these character options. Being able to escape the limits of human biology for a moment and to have characters whose physical capabilities supported a nontraditional gender expression. Okay, yeah, that’s a pretty big crack in the egg.

It hit me around the fifth time I encountered the “trans button question” that maybe there was something going on deeper in my brain. Y'all know how the trans button question asks “If you were offered a button that could turn you into a [wo]man (based on where you are currently identifying on the binary), irreversibly, and completely (both physically and socially), would you press it?” I first encountered this question in this form in the chat of one of my friends, a twitch streamer named shovda (she plays Mario and is really fucking good at it and you should watch her streams). And the first time I encountered it, I answered it. I said that I wouldn’t, because I’d prefer a toggle that would let me go back and forth at will. By the fifth time I encountered that question and realized that that was absolutely positively my answer, I began to suspect something was up. I may have a PhD, but it’s not in self-awareness.

Then I found this [image](https://pics.me.me/oremuart-awhafs-your-gender-goth-no-but-whats-in-your-59513527.png), and awareness dawned on me. I had already figured out to an extent there was a fluidity to myself, that I didn’t feel comfortably sitting neatly in one corner of the binary or even on the binary. I don’t really experience dysphoria, at least I’m fairly sure I don’t. But part of what would really lift me up is finding a good, somewhat androgynous aesthetic for myself that removes me from easy categorization by appearance.

I went out and wore a little lipstick to a bar late in the spring, and I wound up having a delightful conversation with a couple undergrad girls. They were super nice and kind of fangirled at the fact that I was wearing lipstick. They loved that I was going out of my way to fuck with gender expectations, and they wanted to make sure I knew it.

So where am I? Give me lipstick. Give me eyeliner and eyeshadow (someone teach me how to get over being afraid of putting it near my eyes). Give me all of it, please. I’m gonna keep my beard, but give me cute skirts and all the size 14 women’s boots I can get. I’m so happy my hair is getting long again (I had it short for a bit and I was so not feeling that).

(sorry for the slight rant and bad grammar;
i mention (pretty light) feelings about my chest if that bothers anyone &lt;3)

When I look into the mirror, I see a reflection, not myself. I've been questioning for around two years (but had always felt pretty neutral about gender as a kid) and only within the past few months have I done any research. After coming across the term nonbinary, I felt as though it fit and I could immediately identify with it. But after researching it more, I've had a hard time figuring out if I actually count as non-binary.

Sure, my boobs haven't ever really looked or felt right, but they don't really make me upset, I just change my clothes and move on. I think I'd feel better flat chested, aside from any unwanted attention it may attract (in my small 'everyone knows everyone' school). I cant imagine doing anything remotely intimate involving my boobs either (but I've never done anything anyways so what do I know). I don't really fit in with my (all girls) cheer team socially, even though I like the sport, and find that I can't relate to them and their feelings and wish to spend my time doing anything other than planning to get my nails done after the season is over. I tend to pause whenever I need to fill out my pronouns/gender on surveys and documents. I don't feel upset if someone uses she/her with me, but every time someone uses he/him or they/them for me ('mistakenly' over voice chat playing fill games or irl, short hair and deeper voice) I feel happy. Its kind of awkward when my friends 'correct' them too because I couldn't care less about being completely viewed as a girl. I feel like I don't experience real dysphoria though, because I've read about so much worse.

I came out as questioning to my mom in May because I was having a tough time and was really upset and anxious a lot of the time. She told me that I didn't need to think about it, because ""what's wrong with just being a girl? They can wear boys clothes too."" But it just wasn't that simple for me. Now, after 'thinking' of myself with the label of nonbinary, I feel much more at ease. I just don't want how I'm feeling to change later on (maybe I end up just liking androgyny?) and get an ""I told you so"". 


tl;dr I feel invalid, anxious, and unsure and everyone on the internet seems to have much worse dysphoria than I 'experience'. Could I be non-binary?

2019-09-21 04:15:51,d75wb3,6,11,"ok ok so also if anyone’s curious why I’m going back on T if I was dysphoric and lowkey miserable on T before, here’s the scoop --- tw for mentions of dysphoria (obviously), health issues, and eating disorders

Firstly, a lot of the issues I had while on T also had to do with how bad my mental and physical health were at the time - I was gaining a lot of weight and my anxiety and CFS were getting worse and those things are DEFINITELY related and T just kind of created the perfect storm to make me unhappy 

And, yes, some of the changes gave me whole new dysphoria! While I experienced dysphoria over my genitals and sometimes my chest and definitely my voice and height pre-T, on T the facial hair growth and the changes in my face and body shape were very upsetting to me (although, looking back, how much of that was due to weight gain and the worsening of my eating disorder is up for debate) 

Here’s the thing, though, is that I think also a lot of my struggle was with how incredibly fast changes were happening. It was like one day I recognized myself and the next day I didn’t. I was anxious, scared, intimidated, and felt ashamed that I had somehow made the wrong choice. It didn’t help that I realized part of why I’d started T was because I felt pressured by the queer community to medically transition even though I myself wasn’t totally sure about what I wanted yet. 

So, now my mental and physical health are in the best shape they’ve really even been in, even if neither are perfect y’know, and I’ve started to get my weight back under control. And with a lot of stress off my shoulders finally, dysphoria has really started to creep back in in a way it hasn’t in a long time, because I finally have the brainspace to process it. And I put a lot of thought into it, consulted with multiple drs and my therapist and my partners and friends and family, and I decided I wanted to try T again, at a much lower dose this time.

The way I see it, slower and milder changes is much more up my alley, and I know how to cope with and mitigate the less than pleasant side effects much better now than I did a year and a half ago. And honestly? I don’t totally plan to stay on low dose T forever either! I might change my mind and stay on, but mostly I want to complete and/or enhance some aspects of my transition that were put on hold before - like my voice needs to finish dropping, I’d like more bottom growth because oh BOY the euphoria I got from that was strong, and I’d be fine with more body hair and I’d like to work at building up muscles maybe this time, and most of that will stick around or only somewhat soften if I go off T again someday. 

Being nonbinary, really having any kind of complicated relationship with gender even if you are binary and tbh what trans person has a simple relationship with gender, can mean finding a nontraditional route of transition that can involve stopping, starting, and detransitioning and that’s super valid and doable! The important thing is that we all make the choices that ultimately make us happiest in our own skin.

2019-09-21 12:30:12,d79vws,1,17,"So, earlier this week, I started, and finished, season 8 of MTV's Are you the one?
(The shows premise in x number of contestants have 10 weeks to figure out who their perfect match in the house is, as determined by 'experts', in order to find love, and win a share of $1 million.)
This season was a little different, as all contestants were queer/pan/bi, so any of the 15 other contestants could be their match. 
(This is a spectacular premise, and go watch the heck out of it. Its a great season, with awesome people, who I now stan. Highly recommend)

On this show, was a handful of people who are gender fluid/ nb/ trans/ gender queer/ non-conforming.
One of these I saw myself in, A tall, bumbling, cute, amab nerd. He was talking to nother trans/nb contestant, who complemented him on his ability and confortability to look masc, but wear 'femme' clothing. Bumbling nerd said that doung that just felt nice, and made him feel cute, and attractive, and sexy. 
This was something I always felt too, but hid it, as I thought it would be seen as more a fetish,like crossdressing, or like a terrible attempt at drag.
But hearing someone I grew to admire being confident in saying this meant a lot.
Flash forward to yesterday, and I stumble across a super cute long skirt, that was my size at an op shop/ thrift store. So I went to buy it.

2019-09-22 08:31:33,d7nr8h,0,18,"I just bought a nice red lipstick from the dollar store and I love it!

I’m obsessed with red lipstick and before I use to think red lipstick was this forbidden taboo shade that only adults wore. 

I remember being given a small tube of red lipstick for Christmas in middle school and one day when I wore it to school I got made fun of for some stupid reason. I would see other people my age wear shades of red on their lips and they didn’t get made fun of. I took it personally being a 14 year old. 

Before I really started to question my identity I had long hair that went down to my shoulders and I would wear black eyeliner and sometimes black lipstick. 

I looked so feminine and when I really started to look stuff up on the internet about being trans and when I really started to question my identity I knew I wanted to look masculine. I knew I wanted to still look somewhat feminine though. 

I finally understand and I finally know what I want. 

I want to be a man who wears makeup. I AM a man who wears makeup.

I want to grow some nice facial hair and compliment it with shades of dark red and burgundy tones. 

You know how sometimes you buy new clothes and you put together the PERFECT outfit in your head? 

Well I want to wear a nude binder and I want to put my sequin jacket over it. I want to wear that rainbow bow tie From goodwill and I want to wear some fucking makeup. 

Two months ago before I cut my hair impromptu I stood in front of my bathroom mirror with my binder, sequin jacket and bow tie. 

I felt soo euphoric.

I thought to myself “I love this” 

I loved it so so much I can’t even begin to explain how amazing it felt.

I looked in the mirror and I loved myself and I loved everything about that moment.

I know who I am and I know who I want to be and it feels so good to stop repressing your feelings and to finally understand who you are and it feel so good to feel like you CAN be who you are.

The company I work for has recently moved into a new office which currently has gender neutral toilets - that being that each of the toilets are their own cubical ""room"" with each one having no gender specifics.

Upon moving into the new office, management have put up a board with ""office suggestions"" on where people can write suggestions down on what they would like to see in this new space.

The current most upvoted request (upvoted by +1's on the board) is ""**women only toilets**"".

This to me seems to be discrimination against not only non binary people, but also men and trans women who are not comfortable using explicitly designated women or mens toilets.

&amp;#x200B;

The question I wanted to ask was that I am right in saying that this is discrimination?

2019-09-24 19:58:26,d8si2q,0,3,"Hello, r/NonBinary! 

For my undergraduate senior exhibition project, I am compiling a series of comic book issues focused on LGBTQA themes. I am creating a comic book issue about stories for each major letter of the LGBTQA acronym and want to include a more diverse selection of stories from primary sources rather than hunting around for accounts written by journalists and authors. I have chosen to survey Reddit for research because I have done it multiple times in the past and feel the platform is great for reaching a wide and diverse audience.

**Why survey?**

Because I am not a gay man, I am not a queer person of color, I am not Asexual (and so on). The goal is to show off personal queer experiences and what is the point if I disingenuously write a perspective I do not understand? 

The stories can be as short as you want, even just 2-3 sentences, and yours may be adapted into a short 2-3 page comic in one of my comic books. 

**I will not be profiting off of this work but you might help me get a job! :\^)**

# THE SURVEY WILL CLOSE ON OCTOBER 8TH AT 11:00 PM CDT

Here is the link to the survey

I came out as gay my junior year of high school and began to dress more “masculine.” I only shop in the “men’s” section now and have been for about 5 years. I have also been with my partner(cis female) for going on 2 years now who I’ve been talking to about all this and she has been super supportive. But I’ve been struggling with bottom dysphoria a lot lately and it’s affecting my sex life. I naturally have a flatter chest and just wear sports bras and you can’t really tell I even have breasts so I don’t have a lot of top dysphoria. My senior year of high school I wrestled with the idea of possibly starting HRT. I told a couple of my close friends at the time and they were pretty supportive. After graduation I decided not to go on T. But now here I am again questioning my gender identity and having really bad dysphoria(mostly bottom). I’ve looked into buying penis prosthetics such as the joystick from Transthetics but it is very expensive and I don’t want to buy it and then it doesn’t work the way I want it. I don’t have a pronoun preference. I’m okay with she/her and they/them.

2019-09-24 23:22:31,d8v7c4,5,9,"Hi! So, it's taken a loooong time, but I feel like I'm finally ready to decide on my identity. I've put it off and ignored the feeling for so long because of fear, but I really want to try to become who I want to be. 

I've been going by a gender neutral version of my name- Ollie, for a good while now. But, I think I want a name that I like more, that's less tied to my birth name. The thing is, the only names that I've found myself drawn to are names I've used for characters in some DnD games I have, or are currently playing. The first name is Aquila, and though she uses she/her pronouns and I use he/they, I think it works well with both. She's someone I currently play, and I chose her name because it was one I already loved. 

The second name, is Brio. I only played him in one game so far, but he's also one of my backup characters if I need one real quick, or if a current character dies.

Would it be too weird, especially to the people I play with (and our DM) if I chose my name to be the same as one of my characters? Has anyone else done this?

Also, which would you choose- I'm a huge fan of both Aquila and Brio as names, but I'm kinda stuck on deciding.",NonBinary,How weird would it be to choose the same name as a DnD character?,1569392551.0,"{'created_utc': 1569367351, 'id': 'd8v7c4', 'num_comments': 5, 'score': 9, 'selftext': ""Hi!

I'm AFAB and nonbinary. I get she'd to death like...every day. I don't really pass. I've been a good soldier, I've handled it the best I could, I've never yelled at anyone besides my parents (who were very abusive and transphobic) for it...but it's starting to destroy me. So I'm trying to compromise by letting people I trust use he/him pronouns and masc words for me under specific circumstances when talking to others, and using them on myself with people I suspect will give me grief for being nonbinary.

Hey all! The name's Meghan, I'm nonbinary, and my *pronouns are they/them* – I'm still working really hard to feel totally at ease, valid, and confident using my pronouns, but seeing the vast diversity of all you beautiful humans on this page is reminding me that there's no wrong way to be nonbinary, so I guess I'm doing okay \^\^ 

Here are some things that say MUCH more about me as a person than my pronouns ever will: I'm a die-hard Queen fan, strawberry milk is my lifeblood (the REAL stuff, none of that fake syrupy artificial crap), I have a opal-y betta fish son named Aziraphale, I'm an illustrator, and stereoscopic (3D) photography is my hobby. If anybody wants to say hi or check out my art, here's some links! I'm proud and excited to be a part of this rad community!

I started going to therapy for other reasons, but eventually “gender” became a big thing that wasn’t getting resolved. I was on egg_irl for most of that time; started going to genderqueer support groups. I changed therapists about a month ago. My new therapist is a genderqueer lesbian. I first started experimenting with femme dress since this past June.

Today: I went into my therapist’s office with my chipped non-binary flag color nails (also I swapped yellow out for gold, cuz imma be extra) and talked about my events, including an upcoming wedding, for which I bought a dress, heels, and too much makeup and nail polish. My therapist asked me for pictures, and I showed them pictures of myself in 2 different dresses. (I bought my first one in June for a goth festival). They asked me if I ever felt like one gender over the other. I said, “Depends on the day; how I feel; what I’m doing; people I’m seeing” and they immediately nodded and said, “sounds non-binary to me.” I immediately felt relief and validity. Online strangers and my trans friends have been supportive the whole time, but for some reason, I needed my mental health professional to validate me.

2019-09-27 18:52:11,da4rz7,1,5,"So, for the past year or so I've had a particular reluctance to post selfies anywhere on social media. Even with online friends I kinda avoid it. This is not because of hatred of how I look, or anything like that. Mostly I just have this fear that if people see my face or body then they'll start thinking of me as a girl, subconsciously (I'm AFAB). I just want to be viewed as who I am, and the gender I am. 

I know that we've all been conditioned by society to automatically assign genders to strangers based on their appearance - even trans people and allies may do it accidentally. I just worry that people will see my face and have the internal reaction of ""that's a girl!"", even if they're supportive of trans people. Obviously I can't police people's thoughts or judge them for feelings they can't help. But if I just refuse to show my face at all, then I won't have to worry about it happening! 

I've come to really dislike the fact that I have this mindset, though. It limits my behavior and social interaction with people online, including the kinds of things I'm able to post. Sometimes I actually do want to post pictures that show my body or face - like to show off my clothing style and such - but those worries prevent me from taking that step.

2019-09-28 18:19:41,dajove,17,15,"CW: trans confusion, sexuality, dysphoria

As a trans femme non binary person starting HRT soon (really excited and nervous, also trying to deal with the premise \[internalized transphobia lmao\] that I'm ""only doing any of this"" because i'm a 'wristlet' and 'failed normie') i'm always confused by the differentiation between ""non-binary and trans"" people. I really dislike when people say ""nonbinary and trans."" On one hand, I appreciate the inclusion because when you just say ""trans people"" one assumes you are only talking about trans binary people, and while I find it important to actively include nonbinary people in your trans dialogue, the inherent ""othering"" makes me uncomfortable. I see a lot of binary trans women who seek to separate themselves from nonbinary femmes.

I've met two people that use the term genderqueer but also say they aren't trans. Coincidentally(?) these two individuals also struck me as pretty transphobic . One of them in particular actually told me that I should be fine using grindr and that I should be fine being referenced and seen as a man. ""Well, I'm genderqueer and I don't care when people call me a man"" telling me, a trans femme dysphoric nonbinary person that I should be content with whatever identity is bestowed upon me by grindr hookups. This is the same person that wanted to go on chaturbate and pretend to be a pre HRT trans woman ""for fun,"" a response to my other friend, who is trans masculine, navigating cam modelling as a trans person. Even having sex pre HRT for me is honestly super triggering and dissociative as fuck. 

Funnily enough, I actually realized I needed to go on HRT through my sexuality. When I would fantasize during masturbation, I would sort of block myself out. One day, instead of blocking myself out, for some reason, I imagined my body on HRT. It was a huge turn on and for the first time in my entire life I felt comfortable in my sexuality. I realized that I couldn't comfortably perform sex or intimacy because the body I am currently occupying isn't a body I can operate through authentically. I don't know how to slip into the role of a gay male, so I simply dissociate through the entire encounter. This realization was huge for me.

TLDR: I guess I'm wondering why people refer to themselves as nonbinary but non trans. To me, being nonbinary is solely a trans identity and people who operate outside of gender norms without being trans are simply gender nonconforming cis people, and I love and appreciate y'all.

I wore my 1460s (Docs) everywhere, different colors, even while aboard the boats, while at sea. I wore my own clothes, the way I liked them. I no longer had to fit a mold to be popular. Being exposed to all types of porn in the Navy, especially in Europe, I found a lot of it repulsive, especially if it was degrading to women.

I have not watched a professional sports event since Superbowl XXV, at all; I find professional sports to be an exploitative grab at the basal male nature of violence, cheating, and wonton consumption of alcohol. I have always been broad shouldered and muscular so people just assume I must like sports; I do not waste my time with watching it professionally!

I like collecting toys. Specifically 1:6 scale and 1:18 scale action figures, i.e. Hot Toys, Sideshow, NECA, etc. I love LEGO System sets. I love wearing sharp clothes, nice shoes, having clean hair and nails, and using product. I know the meaning of jacquard, as it relates to fabric. I can identify Jimmy Choo vs Christian Louboutin. I have a strong opinion on nail length, shape, and color. I find extremely long nails to be unsanitary and unsightly, but to each their own. I know the difference between Marc Jacob's and Nyx. I like to walk around Ulta and Sephora (my SO is a Rouge).

I can honestly say I loved my shipmates aboard the subs I served on. I would have given my life for them. I respect women. In HS, a friend slapped his gf in the hall for mouthing off; she fell to her knees. I balled my fist and punched him in the jaw, knocking him on his back. I then told him: ""Think about this moment the next time you think about hitting her."" I've always treated no as no, not ""maybe she needs another drink."" 

I know I am not attracted to men, sexually, but i do get envious when i see men, dressed sharp, when i decided to go out like a slob.

I then told him: ""Think about this moment the next time you think about hitting her."" I\'ve always treated no as no, not ""maybe she needs another drink."" \n\nI know I am not attracted to men, sexually, but i do get envious when i see men, dressed sharp, when i decided to go out like a slob. I tend to notice hands and nails often, shoes (I love shoes), the fit of a pair of pants or shirt, hairstyle, etc. I feel like I don\'t fit society\'s definition of being ""a man."" Am I ok?

For context, I've been ""out"" as trans for a while, but only as binary trans. He's always respected that and we've had a few chats about our similar experiences, but I always felt a little awkward because some of our experiences just didn't line up, and he would make some subtle comments that I would ignore at the time.

I've privately been accepting myself as agender and embracing they/them pronouns in spite of those in my life who would refuse to respect that. I mentioned that I don't think SRS or HRT is the right path for me (I'm still on the fence about it, but I feel like most of my dysphoria is social and that I would be happy to exist in my body if it weren't for society telling me I have to ""pick a direction"" so to speak) and he got very upset with me.

Ever since then, he's been talking to me a lot less. I'm worried he might secretly be a transmed or otherwise considers me to be a ""transtrender"", which sucks considering he had no issue with me when I identified as binary, but me changing my pronouns and realizing I wasn't happy with that label is the straw that broke the camel's back I guess.

I am AFAB and one thing I know for sure is chest and uterus periods are my greatest dysphoria.

This is who I want to be. I want to wear makeup and have pretty hair and wear cute clothing. I've spent **far** too long presenting in a masculine way and I really want to change that.

Well, I while I was dropping off an application at a store I really wanted to work at I was told I would not be interviewed because I am AMAB and I would need to cut my hair **very** short in order to be considered, but any females working there would be allowed incredibly long hair. (In fact it was a long haired female who was telling me this). I've just started job hunting again after recently quitting a stressful job and I'm already feeling frustrated. How many locations in this small city are going to take a look at my assigned gender and tell me I need to present myself in a specific, gender-coded manner?

This is why I despise gender-roles, this is why I cannot stand being boxed in and labeled because of my birth-gender. Why are others allowed to have the things I  want simply because of what is in their pants? Where's the equality in that? Is doing that not the very definition of sexism?

I know I'm preaching to the choir here but it just makes zero sense to me and I'm currently pretty angry about it. I'm not cutting my hair, I'm not changing myself to fit their backwards expectations.
