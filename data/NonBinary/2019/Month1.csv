I came out as a transmasculine nonbinary person to my parents a week ago, and although they're continuing to misgender and misname me in an effort to get used to my new name and pronouns, they've been altogether supportive and willing to learn. So much so, in fact, that they asked me to put together a list of queer terms to help them better understand what NB and trans and altogether queer identities are.

So, I've started a term list and am asking you all to contribute to it (with both terms and definitions and term ordering): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hNGytYgg9n8MArpYQBVbZ3ffmFp9V5Lqvc_wBenTkFo/edit?usp=sharing

I know I can just consult then copy and paste from preexisting articles that have comprehensively compiled and defined terms in the way that I'm trying to, but I figure this could be a positive opportunity for our own clarifications and even discussions of these terms. This is still a learning process even for me, so the terms that I've listed as of right now are basically the extent of what I know. Please add other terms, and please feel free to contribute to defining all listed terms (I'm gonna thoroughly go through the doc in a couple days, or maybe even a week or two, to better organize the contributions).

I'm currently saving out my hair because I want to do cute/cool stuff with my hair and to rest from dying it. However now along the way I feel it makes me look so feminine and it makes me sad. I really wish to look androgynous and try longer hair but it feels since I am AFAB it's so hard. I'm planning to dye it in the near future (probably pastel pink, pastel blue or pastel purple) since I've let it rest for over 1 year after shaving it all off.

So I wonder.. are there any good longer hairstyles that can help me look more androgynous? Or is short hair a must?

I'd love to chat with anyone who has had a reduction, especially if you're nonbinary-identified and tried to go for something ""in between."" I use they/them pronouns. I rarely post things like this so I sorta rambled a lot. It might also be relevant that I'm fat - 225 lbs and 5'7"".

I had a reduction on Dec 5, aiming for an A or B cup (I specified I wanted something kinda in between shape-wise, and I wanted to be able to go without a bra). My initial size was a 36I based on a ribcage measurement of 36 and a chest measurement of 44. When I came out of surgery, the surgeon and her assistant said it went very well but they hoped my chest was small enough - eek. My current size (4 weeks out) is around a 36D (chest measurement 40). I assume some of that is swelling.

I'm thinking I might need to have a revision, but since it has only been a month I know my current measurements might not be accurate. I'm kinda dysphoric right now because I have my period (not on hormones, but I've been considering a low dose). It gets to the point where I'm wondering if I should have just gone for DI... but there's definitely a ""not trans enough"" anxiety element too. My body is super curvy so it feels impossible not to be misgendered female 100% of the time. Also, I had a raging period the morning of my surgery and was losing it a little because I couldn't take ibuprofen. I feel like I missed an opportunity to nail things down because I was so anxious and preoccupied.

Overall though, I like the shape that my surgeon created - it's unique and feels like me. I just wanted it to be like...half the size that it currently is. Maybe my chest will get smaller by the time I have my 3 month appt, but I've been fatigue-eating and I'm worried I'm just going to put a bunch of weight back on my chest.

The other thing is that I thought some fat/tissue would be removed from under my arms, but it wasn't, really. I think I had a fundamental misunderstanding of what normally happens during a breast reduction and should have asked more questions. This is a classic issue with me and any sort of medical interactions or body modifications. I tend to screw it up the first time out of anxiety and then I have to go back for some kind of do-over.

2019-01-03 04:58:51,ac26rz,7,1,"Hello all! New to reddit and first post here. Seems like a great community. Appreciate everyone who reads and TL;DR is at the bottom.

This is maybe more a social awkwardness question than a Queer question, and hopefully most of y'all don't have this problem.

I'm AFAB they/them, genderqueer androgynous. I'm not trans and as of now am not changing my body, just my presentation. I'm presenting andro style and demeanor but have a noticeably feminine face and form, so I'm mainly read as a femmey tomboiish lesbian. The average person in my area is getting relatively woke about binary transpeople but not less straightforward identities.

So problem 1: 

I'm generally an introvert in the way that makes me seem standoffish. It's perfectly reasonable for someone to read me as a female lesbian and I'm not innately offended by that, but I also don't like talking about myself and feel self centered about stopping people to focus on a ""me"" thing. So most of the time when I try to casually say ""Actually, I'm not a girl, I'm a 'they', thanks"", my discomfort comes through and I see people pull back as though I'm about to go all raging SJW caricature. Usually, if they're cool, they correct themselves and keep going but a new wall is up in the interaction and it sucks. I come off like I'm ""correcting"" when really I just want to be adjusting I guess.

I know I need to work on my body language and probably tone, but I think picking gentle and friendly go-to wording will help. I always say ""thanks"" and I believe my issues are making it seem sarcastic when it's not. But I mean, I don't want to take out ""thanks""!! And I usually start with ""actually"", I realize that should go lol.

What do y'all say?

Problem 2:

Like I said, people in my area don't know a ton about nonbinarism so what also happens often when I say ""actually, I'm not a girl, I'm a 'they', thanks"" is they don't really process it and assume I'm a transman who's not passing yet. Again, this is often not prejudice and perfectly reasonable to them. But if they refer to me as a male soon after, I want to stop letting that go, but not start derailing entire conversations explaining it, especially if my first correction didn't go down so smooth. 

Does anyone have a concise go-to wording that lets the person make the adjustment and the conversation keep flowing to make this second correction? 

TLDR How do you let people know about misgendering without coming on too strong, and how do you consicely clarify a lesser known nonbinary identity without making the whole conversation about you explaining it?

Thanks everyone!

2019-01-03 11:51:04,ac50f6,25,1,"I'm a 23 year old afab and recently discovered I'm nonbinary and transmasculine. I have known for a while I wasn't cis I just didn't know what I was. I have been larger my entire life. So a lot of gender dysphoria I was feeling I just shrugged off as hatred for my fat body since everyone else seemed to hate it as well. Over the last couple years with the increase of the body positive movement for woman of all sizes I was just starting to become comfortable as a fat woman. And then it really hit me that I wasn't a woman at all. And haven't been for a while. I had dabbled in labels, genderfluid, bigender, demigirl,(notice all of these labels are still connected to some part of my femininity, like I didn't want to let go of that part of me. Partly because I was semi ok being a large woman), pronouns and names etc I didn't feel valid because of my size so I just gave up.


Late November I had this realization that I really truly was not a cis woman or any kind of woman at all. I started going by Avery online (a seperate twitter and Instagram) and using they/them and it just felt so right. My partner has been incredibly supportive of these changes because he's always known me to be not feminine anyways and it was always awkward when I did try with makeup and done up hair and dresses and other stereotypical girl things. 

Then on December 9th we almost died in a head on collision on the highway. I was wearing a binder when we were run into by the oncoming car and sustained extremely bad injuries to my chest. Upon crawling out of the car I couldn't breath and was screaming for my partner about my binder. Bystanders had no idea what I was talking about. Paramedics had to cut it off of me. It was left discarded at the scene. Some kind soul off of a NB Facebook group offered to send me his used binder in the same size when I posted about it and asking for some support. I was overjoyed and allowed myself to accept his offer. I even paid him back for shipping. It's here... but I can't wear it until I am fully healed.


I've been spending each day at my mom's house while my partner has been able to return to work. With my injuries and mental state I just can't be left alone all day. And I'm not out to her so I just get called ""my girl"" and ""birthname"" all day and I get to hear ""she and her"" in reference to me when she talks about my accident. The paper reported me as a woman. The Facebook posts were all awful. And I had no right to speak up about it because I'm not out yet.


So I've decided that 2019 will be the year of Avery and I plan on coming out at some point. I want to be my true self since my true self almost died a secret a month ago.


But I'm having trouble accepting my size as a NB person. I don't think I'll ever have that straight cut androgynous look that I see others with. Does anyone know of any larger NB people with Instagrams I can follow? I just want to see myself in others. I want to see something i relate to.

2019-01-03 17:00:15,ac7m3w,4,1,"I've been thinking of the gap between how others perceive us and our self knowledge. Thanks to this community, I hear from so many people who are struggling with that gap, whether it's due to unsafe environments, experimentation, or lack of resources. Ultimately, I'm wondering whether people choose to express their gender for maximum legibility/passing likelihood, or decide to be comfortable knowing they aren't passing. 

A couple of specific examples:

HAIR: When I had super short hair, I frequently got called Sir or the ""sir-ma'am-sir"" scramble. It felt pretty good. Kids would ask what I am. I confused people. However, I liked having my hair a certain way, which meant I'd trim at least the sideburns and back every week. I'd put gel or goop in it everyday. I could only wear certain hats, etc. Standing in front of a mirror to primp makes me feel more femme, though. I carried around that, ""How do I look?"" voice that I associate with being a woman. 

Now that I'm growing my hair out, absolutely nobody is confused. I sadly pass as a woman. But my hair rarely needs a trim. I don't wash or style it. I roll out of bed like, Okay. Where's the coffee? I can wear a bike helmet or beanie or fedora. No products. My experience of myself feels so laid back, which is something I associate with men. A lackadaisical attention to grooming. 

BINDING: As a genderfluid non-binary person, I definitely have days I wanna look like Stephen Sondheim in the early seventies. I bought a binder. It fits. It works. It looks good with turtlenecks and sweaters. But I know I'm wearing it. It feels like wearing a corset. 

I've been lucky enough to not really need to wear a bra, so even before I was non-binary, I felt like bras or slips were for ultra femme dress up and costuming. I actually like the feeling of being constricted and delicate. But it isn't very gay man as an internal experience. I don't feel like I actually have a flat chest. I just feel like I'm using a product to look good. 

So far, I fall on the side of internal perception. I'm growing my hair out. My binder is lost somewhere in my partner's closet. I have to be in my body all the time, whereas I'm only sometimes being misgendered by others. However, I live with this nagging sense that ""If only I tried harder, people would be less essentialist.""

2019-01-04 18:50:51,acl8pv,10,1,"28, AMAB, Agender, and Gay here.

Background: this story revolves around a Grindr/Scruff meetup I had. These are iPhone apps which, for those not in the know, are geolocation primarily intended to facilitate sexual liaisons between queer men. In a Grindr bio, you have a choice to specify gender and pronouns, and of course I indicated that I’m agender and use “they” pronouns. The Scruff bio however doesn’t give you this option. That will be an important distinction later in the story.

Hopefully I’m not insulting anyone’s intelligence with the above paragraph, but with that out of the way, here’s my story:

I just recently relocated to Chicago. In addition to finding a job, I had been hoping to make some friends, go on a few dates, and satisfy a few of my more base desires on Grindr/Scruff. 

Eventually I met these two guys on Scruff (where my gender was likely assumed to be “male”) who wanted a threesome. I try to assume the best in others, but these were extremely jocky, white, business-type guys who probably haven’t had to put much thought into an identity or perspective beyond being gay. Not unlike the sort I have learned to be careful around when discussing my gender, or social justice at all.

Regardless, I went to their apartment because I have a libido and it needed quelling. I’ll spare the gory details, but we did the deed and then started laying around snuggling in post coital bliss. It’s not out of custom to check one’s phone during this refractory period, and it was this time that they spotted me on Grindr and the biographical information attached to it.

So to my right, the first guy asks me “You’re agender?” I barely had time to dread the incoming conversation when he immediately said “That’s cool. So you use gender-neutral pronouns. I’d feel bad if I got it wrong.”

“Yeah, I am. It’s this whole journey about how I feel in relation to gender roles. I’d hate to soapbox about it too much.”

Then the guy to my left chimes in “Please do, I’m interested in learning about it.”

So in just as much time as I spent messing with these guys, I also educated them on things like Judith Butler and performativity and how I feel uncomfortable being subject to a particular “role” or set of behaviors merely because of what my genitalia look like. Not once did they try to invalidate or alienate me. They were extremely respectful, asked plenty of questions, and seemed genuinely edified to have met (what I assume) is their first agender person.

The story, I feel, has two takeaways. One, in a sense, is that I ended up being more prejudiced than these two by assuming that I needed to be defensive, ironically, because of how I perceived their gender and personal presentation.

The other is that attitudes, I feel, are changing around gender. I’ve only been out for less than a year now, and I have encountered plenty of hostility and dismissiveness from those just learning about my gender identity. But this was refreshingly different, and gives me hope that the we, and especially the next generations, can be proud and less afraid of who we are.

In discussing this exchange, I hope to highlight the ways that things are improving for us, and that more and more people are accepting of the idea that gender is not an absolute based on biology, but relative to just about everyone.

2019-01-04 21:23:02,acmu5a,19,1,"I may delete this post later, but currently I don't know where else to reach out.

&amp;#x200B;

It is true that biological sex is not the same thing as gender, and that gender presentation does not always predict gender either (people of all genders fall in many different places across the femme-masc spectrum). So I am finding it difficult to understand how any of my features necessarily predict my current assigned gender identity. I am afab, I love makeup, I do enjoy feminine clothes, am not really into sports, etc. etc. But much like how enjoying makeup does not make a man any less of a man, how does it relate to me being a woman? If wearing a dress does not instantly transform someone into a woman, how does it necessarily gender me? Many people talk about this intuitive feeling of ""being a woman"" or ""being a man"" or another gender identity, but the more I think about it the more I fail to understand what this intuitive feeling is. So there are two possible conclusions that I can come to: a) gender is a completely made up concept and anyone who genders themselves is lying or b) I am different from most people in that I can't mentally grasp a gender identity, I guess making me agender. Conclusion a is probably not true, but I still cannot bring myself to accepting conclusion b. I guess these are the main reasons for that:

&amp;#x200B;

1) I do not want to appropriate the trans experience. I still feel pretty tied to the label of cis and don't want to poke my nose where I don't belong, I suppose. I also don't have any gender dysphoria and feel pretty comfortable with having a curvy body and breasts (I've had other body dysphoria related to weight, but never anything about sex). I know gender dysphoria is not a requirement for being trans, and I would never question another trans person for not having dysphoria, but I guess I just feel like I have not struggled enough to label myself as trans. As silly as it sounds, I don't want to be a ""wannabe nb"" (I'm so sorry I know that sounds ridiculous).

&amp;#x200B;

2) Maybe nobody *really* has a concrete concept of gender anyway, nothing more than a vague feeling, and I really am just overthinking it. 

&amp;#x200B;

3) I still, all in all, am feminine. I mostly wear feminine clothing, I do enjoy masculine clothing but I don't own a lot of it. I relate to the experiences of women (which could be because I've spent my whole life as a girl though). I am *fine* with female pronouns, but it's more of an indifference. So if I am *fine* with presenting and living as a woman, why should I care?

&amp;#x200B;

I know that I am a lot more critical of myself than I would be of anyone else. If a femme-looking person told me they were agender I obviously wouldn't squint at them and say ""are you reeeeaally agender?"" But I am not sure if what I am feeling is truly agender identity or just confusion. I guess my big question is (something I've tried researching but could not find a satisfying answer for) how do you know what your gender is? How do you define that vague intuitive feeling of gender? Or if you specifically identify as agender, how did you come to that conclusion?

Many people talk about this intuitive feeling of ""being a woman"" or ""being a man"" or another gender identity, but the more I think about it the more I fail to understand what this intuitive feeling is. So there are two possible conclusions that I can come to: a) gender is a completely made up concept and anyone who genders themselves is lying or b) I am different from most people in that I can\'t mentally grasp a gender identity, I guess making me agender. Conclusion a is probably not true, but I still cannot bring myself to accepting conclusion b. I guess these are the main reasons for that:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I do not want to appropriate the trans experience. I still feel pretty tied to the label of cis and don\'t want to poke my nose where I don\'t belong, I suppose. I also don\'t have any gender dysphoria and feel pretty comfortable with having a curvy body and breasts (I\'ve had other body dysphoria related to weight, but never anything about sex). I know gender dysphoria is not a requirement for being trans, and I would never question another trans person for not having dysphoria, but I guess I just feel like I have not struggled enough to label myself as trans. As silly as it sounds, I don\'t want to be a ""wannabe nb"" (I\'m so sorry I know that sounds ridiculous).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) Maybe nobody *really* has a concrete concept of gender anyway, nothing more than a vague feeling, and I really am just overthinking it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) I still, all in all, am feminine. I mostly wear feminine clothing, I do enjoy masculine clothing but I don\'t own a lot of it. I relate to the experiences of women (which could be because I\'ve spent my whole life as a girl though). I am *fine* with female pronouns, but it\'s more of an indifference. So if I am *fine* with presenting and living as a woman, why should I care?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know that I am a lot more critical of myself than I would be of anyone else. If a femme-looking person told me they were agender I obviously wouldn\'t squint at them and say ""are you reeeeaally agender?"" But I am not sure if what I am feeling is truly agender identity or just confusion. I guess my big question is (something I\'ve tried researching but could not find a satisfying answer for) how do you know what your gender is? How do you define that vague intuitive feeling of gender? Or if you specifically identify as agender, how did you come to that conclusion?

2019-01-04 23:06:01,acnvpn,4,1,"When we were expecting our third child, my wife and I went to do an ultrasonography. We decided we wanted to know the sex of the baby. Unfortunately, our kid had the umbilical cord between its legs, but it seemed to be a boy.

We were thrilled. We would have been happy either way. At least that's what we tell ourselves.

At the second medical ultrasound, my wife went alone and asked again about the baby's sex. This time, the sonographer said that the child had both, male and female genitals.

We were upset. My thoughts went wild. I opened the bible to look for answers and found these passages:

&gt; So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. Genesis 1:27 (KJV)

&gt; Thou shalt not kill. Exodus 20:13 (KJV)

Yes, I was thinking about abortion. I didn't know I had it in me. But according to the bible, my child wasn't human.

After I got past my emotions, I started reading about intersexuality. I found out that some infants with ambiguous genitalia undergo surgical interventions to make them look more masculine or feminine. Surgery is done at an age when doctors can best decide what's best for the child: Boy or girl.

I also learned that some people who have surgeries suffer from it as adults. They might end up feeling differently about their sexuality than the well-meaning doctors and parents. This information didn't help me at all. In fact, it scared me even more. But no matter what, we were going to go through it. I was already planning on having the talk with my baby and explaining to it the differences between man and woman and hetero- and homosexual.

Today I know there is at least one more option, which is simply intersexuality. I can't imagine, what challenges intersex people have to face. Stories about suicides, suicide attempts or self-mutilation are frightening. 

As it happens, I won't be dealing with the challenges and joys of an intersex child in the near future. We ended up getting a boy. But it's a shame that I only heard about intersexuality when I was facing the issue myself. Many intersex babies are aborted, killed or mutilated and we never hear from them.

I will never forget what the sonographer at our third diagnostic sonography said:

2019-01-05 17:26:19,acw3fd,5,1,"Sorry if this isn’t the right sub. I recently started to question my gender and sexuality and I was wondering if I could get some guidance. I’m AMAB but I’m not sure how comfortable I feel with that. I put questioning my gender on the back burner until I could figure out my sexuality, aroace btw. 

I started worrying about gender because I had a dream where I was a trans woman. I remember worrying a lot about if I passed. I’ve had dreams where I was male, female, or sometimes a thing without gender, but it didn’t bother me until now. I had another dream where I was a young girl and it felt so real. I know dreams might not mean anything but they were just so intense.

I’ve been looking at trans subreddits a fair bit lately and sometimes I feel a weird jealousy. It’s not always though. It’s just some of the time. Sometimes I’ll see a person who looks more androgynous and I’d feel really attracted, at least that what I thought it was at the time, but now I think it might have been jealousy. I remember yesterday I started feeling what I guess might be dysphoria. I would look in the mirror or at my arms and wish I was more androgynous, but I’m very obvious male in appearance.

I started trying out different pronouns in my head and I felt uncomfortable with all of them. If it’s not too NSFW when I’m in the shower sometimes I wish I just didn’t have sexual organs. They make me feel weird, and it’s not like I want to use them ever. I wonder if my questioning is just due to me being ace.  

I also recently started noticing how at work I act a lot more “feminine”. My voice becomes more high and breathy. And my movements are a lot more flowy. I felt really good acting like that. My voice already sounds somewhere between the stereotypical gay voice and a grocery story announcement saying “clean up on land 8”. So it isn’t too hard to sound more feminine.

The thing is that I don’t always feel like this. Sometimes I feel very neutral and other times I feel a bit more feminine. Sometimes I wish I looked more feminine or androgynous, and others I feel ok. I think it could have something to do with my disassociation and depersonalization. I always feel a disconnect between my body and myself. I don’t feel like my reflection or hands belong to me. When I think if I feel like a man or a woman I usually just end up thinking that I hardly feel like I have a body to begin with.

2019-01-06 00:31:48,ad090g,9,1,"I’ve been questioning my gender for a while and am a little conflicted. I feel that I have the mental discomforts of gender dysphoria without any of the physical ones.

Logically, I feel that I’m NB. I’m AFAB but extremely uncomfortable with hyper femininity. I would never paint my nails, wear makeup, get my eyebrows done, etc. I think I had some gender dysphoria throughout my life because I always had a non feminine side that I wished I could show. Logically speaking, I think I’m non binary. I feel like it would explain a lot about my discomfort with femininity.

However, I’m totally okay with my body. I don’t have the desire to wear a binder or get any surgeries. I experimented with they/them pronouns last year and it just felt unnecessary. I think I would be happy if people called me they/them but it also doesn’t bother me to be called she/her. When I was like 15 I thought I was a trans man for a few weeks and while I was definitely wrong I still feel like that’s a red flag.

I’m okay with being in this body, but my own personal interpretation of gender doesn’t quite line up with the sex I was born as. I get dysphoric when I look too feminine but it’s mostly just that my hair is too long or I don’t like how my clothes make me look like a girl. I’m fine with being physically built like a woman but it’s the social connotations of being a woman (in mannerisms, style, etc) that I reject and fail to identify with. Does anyone have a similar experience? I feel kind of invalid and I question whether I’m actually NB because people here are posting about top surgeries, binders, and pronoun issues but I don’t really have those things.

I grew up in a conservative Christian household in Midwest America. When I was 4 years old I can remember praying that God would make me a girl,

I loved to play dress up and especially loved dressing in my sisters clothes. There was just something about looking pretty that made me feel beautiful inside and I loved that girls seemed to be able to play dress up everyday. 

I never told my family I wanted to be a girl because I knew they didn’t approve of it based on the  somewhat homophobic off handed jokes and comments they would make to one another. I loved feeling pretty and being admired but I didn’t want to be laughed at. But I kept praying that God would make me a girl and I would occasionally sneak clothes  from the laundry basket before they made it to my sister’s room. 

Fast forward through a very repressed teenager years in which I would sneak make-overs with my sisters makeup before I would take a shower so I could get a glimpse of how I felt on the inside. I went to a private Christian college and convinced myself that I was not Transgendered or Gay because I was attracted to women (and men) and because I liked who I was and how my life was going. It was also important to me to find a partner that would get along well with my family. I met my wife at college and we dated for 2 years before I came out to her that I thought I was transgendered when I was younger and part of me felt that it was still a part of me but I loved her and wanted to be with her. We cried and she asked a lot of questions. We both researched and prayed and laughed and cried a lot. She told me she supported me and would love to help me. She even offered to buy makeup and clothes at the store since I was too shy to shop for it myself. Turned out her encouragement was all I needed to flourish. 

 We continued to fall in love and decided to get married. I worked up the courage to start asking her to buy things like makeup and clothes that I could wear around the house. We love our relationship but none of our friends or family know about me being non-binary/queer so we don’t go out that often and if we entertain I get nervous to dress and act the way I am. 

At least I used to. 

This year I am committed to be more of myself and my wife and I have seen such a difference in our relationship since I’ve accepted who I am and have started to embrace it in our lives. I want to share this part of who I am with my family and close friends this year but don’t know how. Like is it even necessary to say?

2019-01-07 16:04:45,adj2e1,7,1,"Hi! Throwaway because I’m A Coward.

I’m sorry this is probably pretty unreadable, i’m really bad at getting my thoughts out but wanted to try anyway.

so sometimes i like to play a game in my head called “do i actually deserve to do what i want with my body or am i just being an ungrateful, spoiled teen”. It’s not a very fun game and always ends with me either crying or so frustrated with myself as to consider self-harm (consider, not actually do. Like i said: A Coward).

I don’t know what i am and any attempt to put a label on myself just leaves me feeling dissatisfied and/or fake. I’m not sure if this is because i just don’t care for labels or because i feel like i don’t fit the descriptions of what’s typically assumed of those labels (i’m not white, my hair is a thick fro, etc.) or some other third thing.

I know what i want to do, though: to have my hair short and wear more neutral clothing.

I think it’s worth it to add that my parents are Christians. I don’t really know where they stand on the LGBT+ community, but i’ve been leaning toward “not very fond of”. My dad *has* made trans and gay jokes in the past and has joked about not wanting people to see me as a boy. I tried to ask my mom if i could wear “less feminine” clothing but she got upset, thinking i wanted to dress like a boy.

I’ve also asked them both about getting a haircut.

Now I don’t mind not having the specific clothes i want, i’m fine with the ones i have for the most part, but hair is a completely different story.

It took a lot of asking, but they eventually said yes after showing them that twa hairstyles were a thing. However, that was a few months ago and i haven’t gotten a haircut yet.

And this shouldn’t be as frustrating as it is, but i can’t stand it? Just… the thought that my hair is still the way it is makes me feel horrible. Whenever i’m feeling particularly stressed out i get the urge to just grab some scissors and cut it all off myself. I’ve been tempted to try to explain to them why this feels so important to me, but i’m horrible with words and i know it’ll only end with me crying and looking like a spoiled brat.

I’ve brought up getting it cut recently, but the answer’s always been “wait”. I assume it’s because we don’t have the money, but my dad’s said he’d be able to do it. My mom, however, really doesn’t want the cut to come out bad which, my hair is already in a state of chaos right now (since neither she nor I feel like putting in the effort to really maintain it), it can’t be much worse. I think she just doesn’t want to lose all my hair, seeing as she's made many comments on how “thick and beautiful” it is.

I’ve thought about getting it cut once I’ve gone out of state for college, but I don’t know when that’ll be and I don’t think I can wait that long.

I hate that i’m so fixated on this, i hate that i want things so much. I seriously wish i could just… Be happy with how i am right now? That i could stop worrying so much over gender identity and just live my life. And yet i feel like i can’t really be happy with myself until i get the freedom to explore these things. I dunno. I just feel stuck.

Tl;dr, probably more comprehensible than the above tbh: i really, really want to cut my hair and dress differently (but mostly cut my hair) in an attempt to figure myself out and feel i’m getting unreasonably upset at my parents not letting me.

2019-01-08 07:45:59,ads03s,5,1,"Hi guys gals and enby pals &lt;3,

I've been on a pretty wild gender questioning ride this last month (one that's felt long overdue), and I've been primarily exploring the femme world (I'm AMAB, for context), in terms of fashion &amp; presentation, but also in terms of.. energy? Mindset? Spirituality? I'm having a hard time putting it to words -- it's been a very internal process. For me, expressing feminine energy (interpret that as you will) feels natural &amp; nurturing &amp; healing &amp; peaceful in a lot of ways. Masculinity though.. I have a hard time separating the toxic elements (violence, intimidation, black &amp; white thinking, results-oriented mindset) from the rest. I can feel that there's masculine energy in me that wants to be expressed too, but I'm struggling with finding appropriate outlets.

Yesterday, I got a reduction in my left breast to better match the size/shape of my right one. The left used to be a full cup and a half bigger than the right, which caused a lot of discomfort, both mentally and physically. The dysphoria I experienced from my chest was very intense, and I tried everything to make myself feel better and to take away attention from that area. I couldn’t even wear a binder without my left breast spilling out the side. But now, once I’ve healed up, I’ll be able to wear a binder whenever I like, and hopefully have a better sense of self and body-related confidence. I’m just wicked happy!

This has been driving me absolutely crazy. I needed to put it somewhere people might read it.

 I am AFAB.  I am a relatively femme person- long hair, I wear makeup, etc. However, I have never felt like I was 100% a woman. I do not feel masc much at all, it is like I am between ""a girl and femme (occasionally butchy, im fluid between them) TV static."". Something i cant give a name to. I have always had this weird dissociation from my assigned gender, even if i do not horribly mind my old pronouns, and adore presenting high femme at times.

I finally realized I may be Nonbinary. They/them feels oddly right used alongside she/her in online spaces. I have tried to find resources on places like Youtube. Unfortunately almost all of the AFAB NB creators on there that I have found are transmasc or androgynous, which is pretty masc coded in many ways. It made me feel like I was fake for being an AFAB femme enby. Was I just a cis girl playing dressup? If someone called me sir, I would feel severe dissonance, but I wish people didnt all assume I was a ma'am. 

I dont mind my chest.
I get mildly dysphoric at monthly
I dont want to take T
I don't feel a need to bind, though i dress very butchy some days. Theres days where i wish i had a smaller chest, but i also already went through surgery in the past to reduce me from huge to large, and am somewhat fine with myself at this point.
I don't mind my old pronouns but prefer they/them

As an AFAB person, am I still real as a nonbinary? I just don't fit the oft seen mold of AFAB enbies and it has given me such insecurity and fear that i have come out on social platforms only to backpedal because I felt like such a fake. I feel like if im not flat, and dont want to be, that im not real.

2019-01-13 19:18:11,afmoyk,5,1," **Otto Eduard Leopold,**  known as **Otto von Bismarck,**  was a conservative Prussian statesman who dominated German and European affairs from the 1860s until 1890 and was the first Chancellor Of the German Empire between 1871 and 1890. 

 

In 1862, King Wilhelm I appointed Bismarck as Minister President of Prussia, a position he would hold until 1890, with the exception of a short break in 1873. He provoked three short, decisive wars against Denmark, Austria, and France. Following the victory against Austria, he abolished the supranational German Confederation and instead formed the North German Confederation as the first German national state in 1867, leading it as Federal Chancellor. This aligned the smaller North German states behind Prussia. Later receiving the support of the independent South German states in the Confederation's defeat of France, he formed the German Empire in 1871, unifying Germany, with himself as Imperial Chancellor, while retaining control of Prussia at the same time. The new German nation excluded Austria, which had been Prussia's main opponent for predominance among the German states.

With that accomplished by 1871, he skillfully used the balance diplomacy to maintain Germany's position in a Europe which, despite many disputes and war scares, remained at peace. For historian Eric Hobsbawm it was Bismarck who ""remained undisputed world champion at the game of multilateral diplomatic chess for almost twenty years after 1871, \[and\] devoted himself exclusively, and successfully, to maintaining peace between the powers"". However, his annexation of Alsace-Lorraine gave new fuel to French nationalism and promoted Germanphobia in France. This helped set the stage for the First World War.

Bismarck's diplomacy of realpolitik and powerful rule at home gained him the nickname the ""Iron Chancellor"". German unification and its rapid economic growth was the foundation of his foreign policy. He disliked colonialism but reluctantly built an overseas empire when it was demanded by both elite and mass opinion. Juggling a very complex interlocking series of conferences, negotiations, and alliances, he used his diplomatic skills to maintain Germany's position and used the balance of power to keep Europe at peace in the 1870s and 1880s.

A master of complex politics at home, Bismarck created the first welfare state in the modern world, with the goal of gaining working class support that might otherwise go to his Socialist enemies. In the 1870s, he allied himself with the Liberals (who were low-tariff and anti-Catholic) and fought the Catholic Church in what was called the Kulturkampf (""culture struggle""). He lost that battle as the Catholics responded by forming a powerful Centre party and using universal male suffrage to gain a block of seats. Bismarck then reversed himself, ended the Kulturkampf, broke with the Liberals, imposed protective tariffs, and formed a political alliance with the Centre Party. to fight the Socialists. A devout Lutheran, he was loyal to his king, who argued with Bismarck but in the end, supported him against the advice of his wife and his heir. While the Reichstag, Germany's parliament, was elected by universal male suffrage, it did not have much control of government policy. Bismarck distrusted democracy and ruled through a strong, well-trained bureaucracy with power in the hands of a traditional Junker elite that consisted of the landed nobility in eastern Prussia. Under Wilhelm I, Bismarck largely controlled domestic and foreign affairs, until he was removed by the young Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1890, at the age of seventy-five.

Bismarck – a Junker himself – was strong-willed, outspoken and overbearing, but he could also be polite, charming and witty. Occasionally he displayed a violent temper, and he kept his power by melodramatically threatening resignation time and again, which cowed Wilhelm I. He possessed not only a long-term national and international vision but also the short-term ability to juggle complex developments. As the leader of what historians call ""revolutionary conservatism"", Bismarck became a hero to German nationalist; they built many monuments honoring the founder of the new Reich. Many historians praise him as a visionary who was instrumental in uniting Germany and, once that had been accomplished, kept the peace in Europe through adroit diplomacy.

A 2011 biographer of Bismarck wrote that he was

&amp;#x200B;",NonBinary,Otto Von Bismark,1547432291.0,"{'created_utc': 1547407091, 'id': 'afmoyk', 'num_comments': 5, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ' **Otto Eduard Leopold,**  known as **Otto von Bismarck,**  was a conservative Prussian statesman who dominated German and European affairs from the 1860s until 1890 and was the first Chancellor Of the German Empire between 1871 and 1890. \n\n \n\nIn 1862, King Wilhelm I appointed Bismarck as Minister President of Prussia, a position he would hold until 1890, with the exception of a short break in 1873. He provoked three short, decisive wars against Denmark, Austria, and France. Following the victory against Austria, he abolished the supranational German Confederation and instead formed the North German Confederation as the first German national state in 1867, leading it as Federal Chancellor. This aligned the smaller North German states behind Prussia. Later receiving the support of the independent South German states in the Confederation\'s defeat of France, he formed the German Empire in 1871, unifying Germany, with himself as Imperial Chancellor, while retaining control of Prussia at the same time. The new German nation excluded Austria, which had been Prussia\'s main opponent for predominance among the German states.\n\nWith that accomplished by 1871, he skillfully used the balance diplomacy to maintain Germany\'s position in a Europe which, despite many disputes and war scares, remained at peace. For historian Eric Hobsbawm it was Bismarck who ""remained undisputed world champion at the game of multilateral diplomatic chess for almost twenty years after 1871, \\[and\\] devoted himself exclusively, and successfully, to maintaining peace between the powers"". However, his annexation of Alsace-Lorraine gave new fuel to French nationalism and promoted Germanphobia in France. This helped set the stage for the First World War.\n\nBismarck\'s diplomacy of realpolitik and powerful rule at home gained him the nickname the ""Iron Chancellor"". German unification and its rapid economic growth was the foundation of his foreign policy. He disliked colonialism but reluctantly built an overseas empire when it was demanded by both elite and mass opinion. Juggling a very complex interlocking series of conferences, negotiations, and alliances, he used his diplomatic skills to maintain Germany\'s position and used the balance of power to keep Europe at peace in the 1870s and 1880s.\n\nA master of complex politics at home, Bismarck created the first welfare state in the modern world, with the goal of gaining working class support that might otherwise go to his Socialist enemies. In the 1870s, he allied himself with the Liberals (who were low-tariff and anti-Catholic) and fought the Catholic Church in what was called the Kulturkampf (""culture struggle""). He lost that battle as the Catholics responded by forming a powerful Centre party and using universal male suffrage to gain a block of seats. Bismarck then reversed himself, ended the Kulturkampf, broke with the Liberals, imposed protective tariffs, and formed a political alliance with the Centre Party. to fight the Socialists. A devout Lutheran, he was loyal to his king, who argued with Bismarck but in the end, supported him against the advice of his wife and his heir. While the Reichstag, Germany\'s parliament, was elected by universal male suffrage, it did not have much control of government policy. Bismarck distrusted democracy and ruled through a strong, well-trained bureaucracy with power in the hands of a traditional Junker elite that consisted of the landed nobility in eastern Prussia. Under Wilhelm I, Bismarck largely controlled domestic and foreign affairs, until he was removed by the young Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1890, at the age of seventy-five.\n\nBismarck – a Junker himself – was strong-willed, outspoken and overbearing, but he could also be polite, charming and witty. Occasionally he displayed a violent temper, and he kept his power by melodramatically threatening resignation time and again, which cowed Wilhelm I. He possessed not only a long-term national and international vision but also the short-term ability to juggle complex developments. As the leader of what historians call ""revolutionary conservatism"", Bismarck became a hero to German nationalist; they built many monuments honoring the founder of the new Reich. Many historians praise him as a visionary who was instrumental in uniting Germany and, once that had been accomplished, kept the peace in Europe through adroit diplomacy.\n\nA 2011 biographer of Bismarck wrote that he was\n\na political genius of a very unusual kind \\[whose success\\] rested on several sets of conflicting characteristics among which brutal, disarming honesty mingled with the wiles and deceits of a confidence man. He played his parts with perfect self-confidence, yet mixed them with rage, anxiety, illness, hypochondria, and irrationality. ...

I started questioning my identity a few years ago when I was in a day treatment program and they had an LGBTQ+ counselor there to talk to people about  sexual orientation/gender identity. As soon as she described nonbinary identity I felt like it applied to me, like I had a vocabulary to describe myself I didn't know about before. I talked about it a lot in therapy but my mental health worsened and I was sent to a residential center in 2016. I mentioned it there a few times but never really felt courageous enough to tell people. So basically I continued living life as a girl and kept using she/her pronouns and going by my birth name. I moved to college last year and kept this up. I told most people I was straight and cisgender. I am actually bisexual (100% certain about that) and I'm pretty sure I'm NB, too. I'm out as bi but it took me a long time to accept that. Now I'm considering coming out as nonbinary as well. My greatest fear is that people will not take me seriously because I'm a young afab person. I feel like there's a lot of stigma for people like me, people seem to think that young/college age people, especially afab people, are ""making up"" sexual orientations and gender identities to be \~unique\~ or whatever. So I'm afraid of coming out publicly as nb. Maybe I'll wait for a while until I'm confident in my identity. I'm also unsure about what to name myself. I love my birth name, Amelia. But the name Toni seemed so right the moment it popped into my head when I cut all my hair off. I am trying to reconcile this gap, maybe I should try to make a sort of gender neutral sounding nickname based off my birth name. Basically, I am a little conflicted and discouraged right now. Kudos if you read all of this. As a side note, my mental health is decent right now, so no need to worry about my safety.

I started questioning my identity a few years ago when I was in a day treatment program and they had an LGBTQ+ counselor there to talk to people about  sexual orientation/gender identity. As soon as she described nonbinary identity I felt like it applied to me, like I had a vocabulary to describe myself I didn\'t know about before. I talked about it a lot in therapy but my mental health worsened and I was sent to a residential center in 2016. I mentioned it there a few times but never really felt courageous enough to tell people. So basically I continued living life as a girl and kept using she/her pronouns and going by my birth name. I moved to college last year and kept this up. I told most people I was straight and cisgender. I am actually bisexual (100% certain about that) and I\'m pretty sure I\'m NB, too. I\'m out as bi but it took me a long time to accept that. Now I\'m considering coming out as nonbinary as well. My greatest fear is that people will not take me seriously because I\'m a young afab person. I feel like there\'s a lot of stigma for people like me, people seem to think that young/college age people, especially afab people, are ""making up"" sexual orientations and gender identities to be \\~unique\\~ or whatever. So I\'m afraid of coming out publicly as nb. Maybe I\'ll wait for a while until I\'m confident in my identity. I\'m also unsure about what to name myself. I love my birth name, Amelia. But the name Toni seemed so right the moment it popped into my head when I cut all my hair off. I am trying to reconcile this gap, maybe I should try to make a sort of gender neutral sounding nickname based off my birth name. Basically, I am a little conflicted and discouraged right now. Kudos if you read all of this. As a side note, my mental health is decent right now, so no need to worry about my safety.

I know that we both feel so much towards each other, and we've had quite an intimate relationship since getting back in touch, but I can't shake that I have this fear, and I think it's about ostracisation.

It's like, I don't have to live my life as an enby, I don't know what it's like to feel the way you have to, and this fear is the closest thing I have to touching on the empathy for what it must be like to present differently from the social norm.

2019-01-15 22:59:33,agehxe,19,1,"Apologies for this long confusing mess of ideas, but maybe some of you lovely folks can relate?

I’m AFAB and have been wrestling with my gender identity over the past few months. I seem to be cycling through this process of obsessing over my gender confusion and trying to find a label that feels right, become more confused and frustrated because nothing seems to exactly fit, decide to screw all the labels and just live my life, eventually become curious about or question my gender again, and repeat. It feels like I’m spinning my wheels and going nowhere. It’s exhausting. 

While I find that many non-binary people’s experiences (particularly agender/genderfluid), resonate with me, I don’t really experience dysphoria aside from mild social discomfort in certain situations – most often when I feel I am being treated or viewed differently because I’m perceived as a woman. 

Generally, I attribute this to disliking performing typical gender roles and patriarchy and all that fun stuff, but on the other hand I sometimes find myself admiring certain male physical characteristics and fantasizing about having a flatter chest or a more masculine build/physique. I’m also attracted to men/masculinity, so this can be confusing as the distinction between attraction and admiration can feel pretty murky. I actually have similar admiration vs attraction confusion towards women too, and have started exploring the idea that I may be bi. 

Aside from the above, what leads me to suspect that I could be non-binary are:

* feelings of being disconnected and apathetic towards gender or identifying with man/woman
* Love for androgyny and gender non-conformity. I dress somewhat androgynously as I don’t shave, wear makeup, have a short haircut, and prefer loose-fitting clothing that doesn’t emphasize my chest and hips.
* Tendency to forget that others see me as a woman and sometimes feeling genderless/gender neutral
* Feel best when I can express myself and dress without feeling like I’m trying to present as masculine or feminine

At the same time, I don’t think I fit non-binary/trans narratives as I don’t want to change my body (I don’t even have an interest in getting a binder, wearing a sports bra feels good for me), I don’t want to change my name, and I’m cool with any pronouns. I’m also not entirely disconnected from being a woman/female as I’ve lived my whole life as one, which has undoubtedly shaped my perspective and experiences. 

This leads to me believe that I’m most likely a cis woman that digs gender non-conformity and overthinks too much. I’m wary as well not to adopt marginalized identities that I don’t wholeheartedly feel that I belong to considering that I don’t share the same struggles with transition and dysphoria.

I suppose I’d feel alright describing myself as agender and/or non-binary, but not transgender. Although being transgender isn’t a requirement to identify as agender/non-binary, it appears that most people who do also consider themselves to be transgender. It seems that most people assume you are transgender if you identify as a non-binary person as well. I think that I’ll end up just confusing and upsetting people by claiming to be non-binary but not trans.

I seem to be cycling through this process of obsessing over my gender confusion and trying to find a label that feels right, become more confused and frustrated because nothing seems to exactly fit, decide to screw all the labels and just live my life, eventually become curious about or question my gender again, and repeat. It feels like I’m spinning my wheels and going nowhere. It’s exhausting. \n\nWhile I find that many non-binary people’s experiences (particularly agender/genderfluid), resonate with me, I don’t really experience dysphoria aside from mild social discomfort in certain situations – most often when I feel I am being treated or viewed differently because I’m perceived as a woman. \n\nGenerally, I attribute this to disliking performing typical gender roles and patriarchy and all that fun stuff, but on the other hand I sometimes find myself admiring certain male physical characteristics and fantasizing about having a flatter chest or a more masculine build/physique. I’m also attracted to men/masculinity, so this can be confusing as the distinction between attraction and admiration can feel pretty murky. I actually have similar admiration vs attraction confusion towards women too, and have started exploring the idea that I may be bi. \n\nAside from the above, what leads me to suspect that I could be non-binary are:\n\n* feelings of being disconnected and apathetic towards gender or identifying with man/woman\n* Love for androgyny and gender non-conformity. I dress somewhat androgynously as I don’t shave, wear makeup, have a short haircut, and prefer loose-fitting clothing that doesn’t emphasize my chest and hips.\n* Tendency to forget that others see me as a woman and sometimes feeling genderless/gender neutral\n* Feel best when I can express myself and dress without feeling like I’m trying to present as masculine or feminine\n\nAt the same time, I don’t think I fit non-binary/trans narratives as I don’t want to change my body (I don’t even have an interest in getting a binder, wearing a sports bra feels good for me), I don’t want to change my name, and I’m cool with any pronouns. I’m also not entirely disconnected from being a woman/female as I’ve lived my whole life as one, which has undoubtedly shaped my perspective and experiences. \n\nThis leads to me believe that I’m most likely a cis woman that digs gender non-conformity and overthinks too much. I’m wary as well not to adopt marginalized identities that I don’t wholeheartedly feel that I belong to considering that I don’t share the same struggles with transition and dysphoria.\n\nI suppose I’d feel alright describing myself as agender and/or non-binary, but not transgender. Although being transgender isn’t a requirement to identify as agender/non-binary, it appears that most people who do also consider themselves to be transgender. It seems that most people assume you are transgender if you identify as a non-binary person as well. I think that I’ll end up just confusing and upsetting people by claiming to be non-binary but not trans. \n\nI’m not even sure how much I care much about being seen as non-binary by others.

I'd like to know how you feel about this, what would you change to improve it and so.  


Here is the answer I gave:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Most people are born with a set of chromosomes that dictates the way your body is. It's tied to your complexion, your genitals, the amount of hormones your body generates, etc. In nearly all of the cases, there are two distinctions which are male and female. That's your sex and that's how you are born and how your body works by default.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;Now, we aren't just flesh and bones, we people evolved in too many aspects and we live according to some society set of rules. Historically, sex influenced how a person should behave, how a person should look, etc. As time passed, this idea of how you should be according to your sex ""is your gender"" as in ""social gender"" and not ""biological gender"".   
  
&gt;  
&gt;So we have always assumed that there are 2 genders. Male and female. A or B. Left or right. But when you start thinking about it you can say some people is ""manlier"" than other, which implies that gender (that set of rules) is not A or B, it's something like an interval between Female and Male so people is not just ""male"" or just ""female"" they may be 20% - 80% for example.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;Some people started thinking about it and realized that maybe they aren't always ""20% - 80%"" they sometimes feel 20-80, sometimes 30-70 and sometimes 90-10. This is just how some people feel and that is just a fact, there is people that feel that way and therefor this way of thinking exists.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;So, what's non-binary gender? Non-binary gender is a set of rules that doesn't fit neither in the ""male gender box"" nor the ""female gender box"". It may take a few rules from that ""male gender box"" and the ""female gender box"". And maybe some of those rules don't necessarily fit those boxes and diverges from them.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;This can be explained with more detail, facts or examples but I'm not an expert or anything and this topic evolves and changes from time to time because it's tied to society. The best way to get to understand those things is by reading, talking, be in some other people shoes, etc.﻿

Anyway. Tomorrow I'm speaking to people I already know, and the job interview might be in English. It will all be much more relaxed. If job #1 doesn't want me, job #2 definitely will.

Opening up a situation (linguistic and otherwise) that suggests a lot of difficult space to navigate for everyone in the near future is not a good ting when all I want is to make a good impression and for them to hire me.\n\nAnyway. Tomorrow I'm speaking to people I already know, and the job interview might be in English. It will all be much more relaxed. If job #1 doesn't want me, job #2 definitely will. It might turn out to be a little more stressful and also a shorter contract, but I think that feeling at ease around the coworkers (and potentially being able to come out to them) really makes up for that.\n\nThanks for listening/reading.

1.  I'm AFAB.  I identify as nonbinary/agender, on the basis that my gender identity is mostly comprised of vague hand-wavey gestures and shrugging.  I do not identify as a transman or as a man in any way.
2.  In spite of this, while my preferred pronouns are they/them, I kind of really dislike she/her and any references to me that assume or state femininity (work boss addressing an email to me and several women with ""Morning ladies"" or similar).  I kind of hate my birth name and shorten it to a masc variant, and kind of like it a little bit when clients mistakenly refer to me as Mr in correspondence.
3.  I have only recently come out to friends/family, and therefore for most of my life have just dealt with feminine terms and pronouns being used for me.  There is only one person in my life who has consistently always affirmed my identity in how they refer to me and talk to me, and I treasure them for it.

Now.  Recent things.

1.  Gender-affirming friend, who did not know I was now out, recently accidentally used ""she"" and ""her"" to refer to me multiple times in a single conversation and I swear it almost gave me whiplash. Although I am used to it in general from other people, and although the context was them *describing a theoretical conversation they would have with a third party who did not presumably know my identity*, it felt really weird and unpleasant to hear those terms coming from his mouth.  (Note, friend was awesome and wonderful when I mentioned it and made extra effort immediately after and I love this dude with a ferocity for that).

2.  I have recently been exploring my kinky side more and have discovered that there is one very, very specific context in which I do enjoy being referred to in feminine terms.  And this is specifically in a kinky D/s subtext (terms like ""good girl"" etc for example).  And I do not know what to do with this information.  It's like the only context in which femininity feels right for me is when I'm being rather thoroughly... well... it's kinky BDSM stuff in which I'm the sub.  

3. In discussion with one of my doms about this, he suggested if I was curious about exploring that more he'd be happy to try calling me ""good boy"" in some contexts instead and I feel like I had both a positive and negative reaction to even the idea of that, simultaneously?  I do not know where to go with this or how to feel about it.

I guess I'm just wondering...

1.  DAE experience a weird whiplash when someone who normally affirms your identity makes a minor error that you are normally way more able to handle when it comes from other people?

2.  DAE who does kink stuff get additional complicated and possibly even contrary Gender Feels when in specifically kinky contexts?  WTF is this and why does it cause such a strong and unexpectedly positive reaction in me?

I know this is a common experience leading up to top surgery, but the kind of social dysphoria one experiences as an agender enby feels really isolating sometimes. 

I’m a part of a couple different to surgery support groups and they are great communities, but the vast majority of folks on there are trans men or trans masculine. I never really see anyone who looks like me. I’m currently almost 3 months on T, but an incredibly low dose that I only plan on taking short term to deepen my voice. After top surgery, I’m still probably going to be read as afab. And I think I’m nervous that my dysphoria won’t go away because of that. Like yeah my chest is my biggest “tell” which is why I want it gone, but I’m also nearly 33 years old and am a parent of a preteen. I’m past the baby trans days where I’m being read as a smooth faced teenage boy. It’s not that I *want* to be read as male, I just would rather get stuffed into that box because it means they aren’t seeing me as afab.

Can anyone relate? I’m lucky to have a lot of wonderful trans friends, and the most amazing trans partner anyone could ever ask for so I have plenty of community. But I don’t really have anyone who is also agender and can relate to the catch 22 of wanting that inbetween and knowing you can never really have it because society has such binary vision.

2019-01-20 21:29:06,ai2kji,6,1,"Hey all.  After a long period of questioning, I'm starting to get more comfortable accepting myself as NB.  Over the course of this year I want to go on a gradual process of altering my appearance to look more androgynous.

One thing that's been on my mind lately is my hairstyle (or current lack of style).  I'm not bald per se, but my hair is definitely thin in places and when I brush it a certain way, it tends to emphasize the thinness in a way that I personally don't find flattering.

I've thought of long hair but I find longer hairstyles to get uncomfortable in warmer months (or if I'm in a warm place).  What I'm thinking of is some variation of an undercut, though I've never gotten one before so I'm not sure how I would describe one to a stylist.

(Also, I have typically gone to Great Clips to get my hair cut.  I'm not sure if an undercut is something that I should go to a specialized place for instead, maybe a queer-friendly spot?  I'm in the Seattle area, so I do feel like there are suitable options available but I've never done something like this so I'm not sure.)

Another thing is I'm visiting family in late February, I'm not out to them yet, so I don't want to visit them with this kind of haircut yet.  I'm thinking of getting a haircut between now and then that would be a subtle ""preparation"" for an undercut, like, maybe have the sides/back short but not buzzed completely, and keep letting the top grow?

Then when I'm back from my visit and have let the hair grow again I plan to get a true undercut, and hopefully if I like the shape I'll be confident enough to dye it (never done this either, but I really want to try it out).

Here are some different views of my head so you all have an idea of what I'm working with:

**tldr;** This will probably read a lot like a rant. If you'd like to save time, the summary is that I don't know if I'm non-binary, or if I'm a cis-gender woman with a sexist view of what it means to be a woman.

\---

Still want to read? Well, if so...

&amp;#x200B;

What does it mean to feel ""like a woman""? Is it by the way I dress, the way I think, the way I look at other people? If I'm *not* a woman, what are women? What do I use as evidence to prove I am or am not a woman?

How do I know if I'm non-binary, or just deeply sexist?

When I was a little, I despised anything I saw as ""girly"", because I considered it frivolous. I didn't consider myself ""boy-ish"" either, and I would describe myself in my head sometimes as a ""he-she"", or a girl with boy-ish tendencies. Even that didn't quite fit, and if I were to describe how I see myself now, it'd probably be as ""femme-neutral"".

Is this a sign? Or was I a tomboy?

At least right now, I don't want to dress androgynously. Or do I consider ""androgynous"" to be something it isn't? I wear dresses and jeans and heels and sneakers. For awhile I did wear makeup, and now I don't. I'm growing my hair out, I'm constantly evaluating how cute or pretty I am, I hate my chest sometimes.

Does there need to be a theme for me to be non-binary?

I have a fiance that's straight all the way. I want to be woman enough for him, but I get depressed that I am. I don't want to be inferior, I don't want society's expectations of me. I want to experiment, but I don't know what I'd change. Perhaps I'm just scared. Perhaps I'm right where I should be. Or I'm not, and that'd be wasting our time.

Is this just indecisiveness? Am I hurting him? Is this hurting me?

Pregnancy terrifies me, because I don't want to be a mom. I think I'd want a kid, just not from me. Whenever I hear anyone say what ""a woman's place is"", my immediate reaction is that ""I never asked to be one"". I wonder what I would choose if I was asked. I think I'd put it off forever.

Does not liking the ""woman's role"" make me not a woman?

2019-01-21 14:51:55,aias1z,1,1,"Or my delusions of such a thing, depending on how you look at it.

First things first: I'm not an incel. I lost my virginity at 16, and I am entirely capable of forming and keeping long-lasting, committed, sexual relationships. In fact I am in a 10-year-long-and-still-going relationship.

But this still kills me inside sometimes. I wish it didn't, but it does.

It kills me that I will _never in my life_ know the playfulness of mutual attraction and flirting and casual sex because I'm only ever material for SERIOUS BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS.

I've always been a fucking acquired taste. No fucking body ever thinks I'm attractive from the get-go, as far as I know. I don't think I even register as a sexual entity to non-bisexuals. And then even with bisexuals it takes me a good 1-3 years to grow under their skin and for them to notice that well fuck yes they actually like me in _that_ way.

On the other hand, I'm quite averse to the prospect of getting physically intimate with a stranger, because what reason do I have to make someone feel good if I don't care about them, regardless of how hot do I find them? But every single one of my friends of any gender either IS or HAS BEEN such HUGE SLUTS that if you cut my arm, I bleed distilled 99-proof envy. In fact I don't even listen to their stories anymore, I just sit there silently with glazed eyes doing something else.

I've never had the chance to explore my sexuality outside of commitment, and I never will. And even if I had, I wouldn't know what the fuck to do about it, because my whole romantic life has been either 100% commitment or 100% unrequited crushes, and therefore I've been pretty much stripped clean of any playfulness around the subject.

I feel like I have 0 sexual agency. I can be into almost any sort of person, but in practice I'm strictly limited to whomever falls head over heels for me first. People don't regard me as either a man or a woman. It's like I'm an ""it"", an alien or a robot. Barely a human altogether.

_Other people_ have this thing where they engage in social interactions with the express purpose of finding someone to copulate and/or cuddle with, and miraculously this intention doesn't exclude them from the goal itself, meanwhile if I have the same intentions I automatically become a creep (except for people who are in love with me).

As soon as I give off any vibes of unrepressed sexuality, people look at me like I'm High King Pervert - Yet at the same time, of all the people I know, I'm THE ONE with the capacity to keep their pants zipped up when chances are good that zipping them down is going to have unpleasant consequences.

I've had _not once_ made successful sexual or romantic advances to people of any gender. Every person that I've gone to bed with was somebody I dated long-term, and that only after months or years of friendship, then fessing up, discussing the issue and agreeing that we'd rather be together.

Every person I've tried to flirt with or woo has declined with various degrees of tenderness or harshness, or ignored me.
 
I've been variously described as ""too lusty"" (by people with more partners than me, lol) or ""a boy with a lesbian's aura"" (by people who have dated lesbians, so  that's cool except it doesn't really work out in real life), ""too asocial"" (being social has never helped my sex life one bit, even when I was), ""attention too spread out"" (this is built into everybody single and willing).

The moment I dare to speak up in real life about how I feel about all of this, accusations of entitlement, misoginy and ""giving too much importance to it all"" start flying.

* #1 - Entitlement: I don't think people owe me anything at all. In fact I'm not the kind of person to push someone for sex. **Somehow, the people who _expect_ to fuck 3 or 4 different people in a week, never have their potential entitlement or lack of it brought into question.** And yet I have had a friend complaining to me that maybe ""he had lost his mojo"" because he didn't manage to score with anybody in his first 2-3 weeks in a new country.

* #2 - Misoginy: I don't give a flying fuck about the gender or equipment of anybody I'm into, at least _prima facie_, and I don't ever make gender distinctions when talking about flirting and sex life. The last time I said or thought ""women/girls do X or want Y or Z"" was about 10 years ago. I plain don't think in such terms.

* #3 - ""Giving too much importance to it all"": **Somehow, people who spend hours on tinder, or talking about their recent sexual exploits, or are willing to fly hundreds of KM just to bang somebody, are never questioned about, maybe, giving too much importance to casual sex. The same goes for people who are known cheaters, or who are willing to juggle 4 or 5 uncommitted partners - nevermind the accumulated headache of dealing with so many people intimately.**

TL;DR #1: The contrast between my life and that of my peers makes me painfully aware of nonbinarity

TL;DR #2: If I'm not regarded as either a man or a woman I might as well fucking run with it.

TL;DR #3: The jury is still out on whether I'm demisexual or not.

2019-01-22 01:49:56,aihriz,7,1,"Hey wonderful people,

Recently I've been working on figuring out what I want to do with my future. I've known for the past four or so years that I am nonbinary (with a leaning toward the masculine), but for the past year or so, I've been trying to figure out what exactly that might mean for my future. I've been weighing the possible pros and cons of taking testosterone, and while I'm far from making a decision, and want to see some sort of gender counsellor about it, I've made a little bit of progress in figuring it out.

There are definitely some things I would really like about testosterone:
- I really like the idea of having more facial hair (I'm fortunate in that I'm already quite androgynous, and have the ability to grow some scruff), and even if I decided it wasn't for me it could be shaved.
- The fat redistribution sounds great, though I know it's not permanent if I decided to go off of testosterone.
- My voice is already quite deep and in the androgynous range apparently, and I'm somewhat nervous about the change, but I think it would be something I would like given that I always try to speak as deeply as I can, and get dysphoric when I sound higher pitched.
- Doing some workouts, combined with testosterone, might help to make my already very small breasts seem smaller. It'd be great if I was fortunate enough to be able to bypass surgery that way, though I know that might not work.
- I'd be pretty okay with extra body hair. My arms and legs are already quite hairy so I don't think I'd mind hairiness elsewhere.

The possibility of hair loss isn't great, but it's not too strong in my family and if necessary it could be avoided by coming off of testosterone.

The main obstacle is, to me, bottom growth. I'm completely okay with my downstairs situation as it is currently, because it feels closest to having nothing there at all. I know that bottom growth is unavoidable on testosterone, and that if I want any of the changes I've listed, I will have to deal with stuff going on there --- but the idea of that makes me feel really uneasy. I think I'd be relatively okay with it if it could be hidden? But I know that might not be possible. 

TL;DR: I suppose I'm asking if anybody else has been in the same situation --- feeling very drawn to looking masculine, but not wanting to go too far and becoming dysphoric about looking/feeling too much like a man. Has anyone any experience with bottom growth in this regard, if they'd be comfortable sharing?

I've known for the past four or so years that I am nonbinary (with a leaning toward the masculine), but for the past year or so, I've been trying to figure out what exactly that might mean for my future. I've been weighing the possible pros and cons of taking testosterone, and while I'm far from making a decision, and want to see some sort of gender counsellor about it, I've made a little bit of progress in figuring it out.\n\nThere are definitely some things I would really like about testosterone:\n- I really like the idea of having more facial hair (I'm fortunate in that I'm already quite androgynous, and have the ability to grow some scruff), and even if I decided it wasn't for me it could be shaved.\n- The fat redistribution sounds great, though I know it's not permanent if I decided to go off of testosterone.\n- My voice is already quite deep and in the androgynous range apparently, and I'm somewhat nervous about the change, but I think it would be something I would like given that I always try to speak as deeply as I can, and get dysphoric when I sound higher pitched.\n- Doing some workouts, combined with testosterone, might help to make my already very small breasts seem smaller.

The androgynous styles I love are the flowy, gothy, elven sorts, with long hair and eyeliner and flowy layered skirts and long coats and painted nails, and it really bothers me that that just falls squarely into lightly alternative feminine instead of something androgynous and transgressive (emphasis on trans)? I like my style, I like all my flowy skirts and my long hair (I cut it short and dyed it teal a couple years ago, and I prefer it long like it is now) and my eyeliner and my long painted nails, and I don't WANT to transition. I don't want to swap out my feminine androgynous for masc androgynous. I don't want to go on T (I like my smooth face and my soprano singing voice and I have plenty of body hair as it is) and I don't want to start wearing, like, jeans and flannels instead of leggings and skirts, just to be visibly androgynous.

Hi everyone, I'm hoping to get some advice, perspectives, and, if possible, some help here.

A bit of background: I identify as a nonbinary trans man and I use he/him pronouns. I'm a person of color. I've been socially transitioning for over a year, have changed my name and pronouns with friends, family, &amp; colleagues, and am in the process of legally changing my name. I don't know if I can/should change my legal gender (I'm AFAB), because despite never having taken T, I look pretty masculine, but I am afraid that having ""M"" on my documents and having people read me as female \~50% of the time could be dangerous when I cross international borders, which I have to do frequently both for work and to see family who live abroad. Basically, as an enby trans guy who wants to look just on the masculine side of androgynous, I'm trying to decide which is more dangerous: having an ""F"" and looking male 50% of the time or vice versa. I would LOVE advice on that, but that's a slightly different discussion...

Mainly, I just want to see if anyone else has experienced their dysphoria like I am experiencing mine, and if so, what y'all have done about it. I am really struggling with my chest dysphoria. Since puberty, I've felt like my body is acting of its own accord, like I have no control over what my body is doing, particularly in terms of having very large breasts. (I'm okay with what I have downstairs, personally, though I do have some bottom dysphoria.) But having large breasts (EE/F cup) makes me feel like my body is not my own, and it's making me depressed and like feeling or wanting things for myself is pointless, because even my own body doesn't feel like a home. It's also very hard to exercise because putting on a sports bra makes me close to having a panic attack. (I think it's something about feeling the cups of the bra around my breasts, pushing them together.)

I've been binding for about 3 years now, even before I admitted to myself that I was trans, but my breasts have grown in the past 6 months due to birth control, going from a D cup to an EE/F cup. Now, with my chest so large, binding no longer relieves my dysphoria like it used to. I am also a pretty skinny person, so my breasts are extremely noticeable to me, let alone to everyone else, no matter what I wear.

I am really struggling with the idea of getting top surgery, feeling a lot of internalized messages of guilt about how many cis women would love to have my large chest, and feeling afraid that something will go wrong with the surgery. I feel like my breasts are so beautiful, but I just wish they were on someone else's body, that if the world ""needs"" beautiful large breasts (since society seems to love them so much and guilts me for wanting to not have them...), that someone else could carry them. I also feel like I've lived with them so long now that I'm afraid top surgery wouldn't alleviate my dysphoria, like--will anything feel right? Is there any way for me to feel like my body is actually mine? Is there a way out of this hell? Can my body ever be beautiful AND feel right?

Some days I feel like I should just give up and accept that my body is completely separate from my sense of self, that I have no ownership over anything between my navel and my shoulders, and try to dissociate as much as I can so that I can at least live my life. My breasts have been almost entirely numb since puberty. I think 20 years of dissociating may be the reason; it's just that dissociating doesn't seem to be helping me anymore.

tl/dr: I have EE/F cup breasts and terrible dysphoria, I feel like my body doesn't belong to me, and feel guilt for wanting top surgery. I want to dissociate to pretend I just don't have a chest, but after 20 years of dissociating, it's not working anymore. Has anyone else felt this way? Is dissociating from my chest for the rest of my life even possible? Or will this just get worse and worse? Am I alone in feeling this?

I'd really like to understand what makes a person feel nonbinary. Is it feeling that one doesn't fit in with normal gender stereotypes and is seeking another avenue? Is it feeling that one's body doesn't match their insides? Is it something else entirely? I'm really just ignorant in this area and don't want to be. 

The main part of what I'm struggling to understand is if it has to do with fitting gender roles. For example, I identify as a gay man. As a kid, I listened and danced to Avril Levine with my sister and played Barbies with her and her friends. I never didn't feel like a boy even though I was doing things often associated with girls. I never really thought of my gender as anything but a characteristic of body I was born in. Can you help me understand what makes a person feel nonbinary?

2019-01-23 13:29:52,aizpcu,1,1,"Androgynous has always been a concept for which I have been attracted and with which I have identified a great part of my life.

Although I have known the difference between gender, gender identity and sexual preference since time, until recently I was aware that they are totally independent.

Over the years, the list of male customs with which I do not identify has been growing. However, I had always thought, ""Ok. Men do this thing, but I can still be a man without having to do that"" as if first of all I owed allegiance to masculinity and not to myself.

2019-01-23 18:13:19,aj2lbk,5,1,"AAAAh guys, I wrote a poem before, but who has the time for that! I'm genderqueer, almost on T and looking forward to it with a calm mind. I will be some years on probably and then stop. 

**My question here is:** Do you know anybody like me? Do they (or you) identifies in some way?

&amp;#x200B;

I feel I don't have an identity. I do come out to people depending on their understanding. So it is trans, genderqueer, non binary, ftm. In a strictly binary world I would be a man, no doubt about it, but in a wider world I'm just... I? I almost always say that I'm a guy because in my language everything is gendered, so people have to speak TO me in a way or another. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Description of my dysphoria experience:*

I'm very guy aligned and pass most of the time, even my therapist jokes that I'm very binary and wonders if I am suppressing the idea to just be a man. My body has always been very masculine. I'm athletic and don't have much of a chest now. It looks like I have pecs and then there are these floppy tits lower down. I don't think much of them, I don't love them, but I don't dislike them either, especially now that have more hair on them. I see them as mine and not ""feminine"". Breast cancer runs in my family and it's very possible I will have to take everything away sooner or later whatever I have.

I consider my period a chronic illness that I forget about till it comes, luckily it's very short. I use a cup because wetting myself crushes my brain and I literally shut down if I don't wear a prosthetis, I always felt I have been mutilated. The idea of period coming back once I stop T doesn't bother me that much tho (but I wonder if it's because I don't really want surgeries and go bald like my father, so it sounds like a good enough compromise).

I need to lower my voice, it makes me feel feminine and gets me misgendered. I would love a broader neck, be hairier on my body. I would love if my face changes even a bit so I will have again medium-long hair.

&amp;#x200B;

**In short** I wanna be myself. I look like a thug boy with tits, I wanna look like a metal man with tits. I say look because I don't feel anything in particular.

I feel like I should have top surgery or change my sex marks because why not? I pass so much, why look weird? Do I want so much even an harder life? Am I not tired enough to be attached and mocked for my look or outed by documents? I am not a woman for sure after all, but I don't feel entirely like a man. I struggle to tell myself it's ok to be non-binary, and see myself there, especially when most of the times it seems to mean genderless or androgynous.

Her example was this:

Instead of ""Buenos días a todos"" (good morning everyone), we are supposed to say ""Buenos días a todes"", or instead of ""los niños"" say ""les niñes"" (the E being supposedly neutral, opposite to the O=masculine and the A=feminine).

I acknowledged that I can't speak to a gendered language, but that in terms of using the correct pronouns, which may include gender-neutral ones, I just don't see why it's so hard for some people to adjust, why they don't think they should refer to someone as they request. It doesn't impact them at all, in my mind, they are just being stubborn and resist for their own skewed 'beliefs'.

&amp;#x200B;

I know they're not going to understand it, solely because non-binary genders aren't very well understood by most people... Also my dad doesn't really know about non-binary genders (as far as I'm concerned, I don't have a really good relationship with him), my mum doesn't really understand it, and my little brother will probably think there's something wrong with me. My family are kind of meh about me being gay, but they can at least tolerate it.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to start taking testosterone, cut my hair, wear more boy's clothes (although I do still like some girls clothing)... But I know my parents just won't understand it. I've been having dysphoria as far back as six years old, though due to me getting diagnosed with depression at around 13/14 years old, I barely feel dysphoria or any emotion at that now, because I just don't care about anything anymore... I'm 16 and still haven't transitioned. I want to transition but because of depression, I just don't care... I want to but my mind just doesn't care.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like if I transition and combat this dysphoria, my depression will go away, because I'll finally be happy with myself. I'm convinced my dysphoria is the reason for my depression.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been considering getting a job, but everything is an effort when you have depression, and some days I feel so awful I can't even get out of bed... So I doubt I'd do well at any job at this point... Also it would probably be hard to hide my self-harm cuts and scars on my forearms due to how some of the work uniforms are.

&amp;#x200B;

How do I come out to them? And by them, I mean just coming out to my mum tbh... I doubt my dad or brother would take this the same way my mum would. Could I perhaps leave a letter explaining it and then leave the house? Then again I still feel like one letter wouldn't sum it all up... Do any of y'all have some good tips for coming out as non-binary? If so, I'd be forever grateful if you helped me out.

2019-01-28 23:35:11,akto6t,2,1,"TL;DR- im AFAB and currently femme presenting and the constant misgendering is having a huge negative impact on my mental health. How do I deal?

* * *

So this is gonna be a rant and one I suspect is nothing unfamiliar to many enbys 

I’ve been out as GF/NB for the better part of 5 years. I made a huge announcement on FB and I even received some affirming messages from friends (and not so affirming chides afterwards at family gatherings). I work in very queer friendly circles, with other enbys and trans folk and ally’s who understand NBettiquete and my social circles are mostly made of the same, in fact my best friend works with me and is also an enby. I’m not super in your face about it, but it is known and reminded that I prefer neutral pronouns, I expect people to fuck up but as long as I know they’re making an effort I’m generally cool with it. However this has only been in the last year, because I sat through 3-4 years of not correcting people who misgender me; I snapped last year and got upset because the queer folk I mentioned above, my best friends, childhood queer friends, they never ever called me they/them until I got upset (i am also BPD and tend to overreact). I don’t like irl confrontation but I make sure all my social tags are explicitly enby, I often send reminders on FB, IG etc that I am, and 4 years of my friends liking the posts they never actually called me what I am. 

I know I should have been more vocal but I mostly snapped when my BFF came out, they made one status and then everyone was like “ok, C is enby, cool” and from thereon out it was explicit that that’s how it was. I made a status a few days later as a reminder. I started being more vocal. Friends got mad at me sometimes because they said I never mentioned it. 

I recently started dating a very lovely but (in the best way, ignorant) cis guy who makes me super happy and I love him to bits. He just honestly comes from a religious family and wasn’t taught about some stuff and I forgive him, but he’s only ever known me as an enby and tries but doesn’t really try. Same with my workmates and boss and friends. They say they’ll do better when I correct them and never do. My partner will warn me before I meet his friends “sorry but they’ll probably call you ‘she’” and is apologetic but also constantly misgenders me to the point it feels like he doesn’t try. 

I’m uncomfortable that he makes big deals about making sure his fam and friends KNOW I prefer they/them but doesn’t seem to use them. Frankly I didn’t want announcements, I just wanted my pronouns used normally by him and friends and corrected sometimes. 

I used to look a lot more neutral but decided to grow out my hair so I do present as femme right now but I also have very neutral things about me. 

I suffer from a lot of mental health issues (GAD, GDD, ADHD, BPD, ED, BDD) and am a spoonie. 

This is a long post but yeah what do I do and how do I deal ",NonBinary,How do you deal with constant misgendering?,1548743711.0,"{'created_utc': 1548718511, 'id': 'akto6t', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'TL;DR- im AFAB and currently femme presenting and the constant misgendering is having a huge negative impact on my mental health.

When they used to present as their birth-assigned sex (female) and used she/her pronouns it seemed like traditionally feminine compliments were the right choice.

Do y'all prefer compliments that align with your birth-assigned sex (and, most likely, your upbringing)? Or do you prefer the compliments normally reserved for folks who had the opposite assignment? Or do you prefer mostly neutral words and phrases? Or maybe both?

Do you feel strongly about which ones are used, or is it only a slight preference?

How does context affect it? Do you want to be called ""pretty"" when you wear a dress but ""handsome"" when you wear a button-up shirt and and tie?

What about during amorous activities? Does your role/position make a difference?

I guess I currently identify as a cis female lesbian. Since I was around the age of 16/17ish (currently 20) my gender is something that I seemed to question every now and then.. 

What I’m struggling to figure out is if I’m NB or if I just like to present as a more masc/andro female? 

Things that make me think NB are things like wishing my facial structure was more masculine, that my voice wasn’t so feminine, for my boobs to be even more non-existent than they already are (I’ve considered binding but that seems rather restrictive and uncomfortable). I also really hate my name it’s undoubtedly a girls name. I know these things don’t necessarily make you NB or not. But I guess i have a constant struggle of wanting to present less feminine as quite a small petite (I really hate that word but it’s all that works) human 

The things that make me think well maybe I’m not NB is the fact that those things don’t bother me tooooo much? Like sure they’d be fucking great but what can I realistically do about it?

I also get pretty excited whenever someone doesn’t immediately assume that I’m female. Most recently I was out clubbing and someone had to ask one of my friends what my gender was and it felt like an accomplishment of sorts? Idk it was good. 

I guess I’m wondering what your thoughts are? If you’ve had similar feelings and what not? I don’t have any trans friends (irl or online) to chat to about these things so..

2019-01-29 21:05:15,al4q7c,7,1,"This is a pretty generic ""muh story"" post, I know, I know-- If you read anything this is just my hello to /r/nonbinary!

[AMAB] My initial coming out to myself ~9mo ago was actually while browsing /r/genderfluid, and what got me to start examining my own gender, and would keep a journal of my day to day experience of gender (and sexuality while I was at it). About a month later I had a straight week of gender euphoria like I had never experienced before, and coupled with a slightly shallow reluctance to take on any kind of genderqueer label, I decided I must be a trans woman.

And then that feeling wore off, but I kept trying to force feminity on myself and it... guess what? made me dysphoric. So I suppressed for ~3mo. Oops.

Then about 4mo ago it all crashed back down on me just how inauthentic my life was and I renewed my vigor to be transfem. And in that time I've experienced enough tumultuous euphoria and dysphoria to be entirely confident that there's no chance I'm cis.

But even after 2.5 months of transfem HRT and a whole lotta steps and comings-out and wonderful affirming moments, there are still non-insignificant stretches of time where being a boy still feels inaccurate, but being a girl certainly doesn't feel accurate either. And times that the idea of being female is *more* dysphoric than being male. It's to the point where I'm recognizing that I'm searching far and wide for other people who consider themselves binary trans who will fit the things I'm experiencing and coming up shorter and shorter every time. 

So I've thought about it for weeks and weeks now and... I'm taking another shot at discovering an identity that describes my experience. And... **I feel free again!** It's like the two 40lb weights that are the gender binary have been lifted from around my neck. **Not wanting to have to explain another gender to cis people is a DUMB reason to lie to myself. So today I'm gonna stop using that excuse!**

I'm looking forward to learning from this community, other genderqueer communities, and the wealth of enbies in my IRL trans spaces. A lot of getting back to this point has been normalizing non-binary to myself, and I still have a long ways to go!

I wasn't huddled between clearance section aisles cringing every time I thought someone saw me. I didn't grab the cheapest thing I found because I had to guess my size. I didn't pray for a self-checkout. 

This morning, I carefully chose my outfit (nice leggings, long shirt, chelsea boots with a slight heel), did my makeup, grabbed my new leather tote, and went to an outdoor mall. I walked into a premium store. Inside, I said hi and chatted and asked for help from all the really nice people working there. I picked out several different types of tights in different sizes and asked for a changing room. When they asked for my name, I gave it with a smile, and they wrote it on the whiteboard on the changing room door with the word ""yoga"" underneath and a bunch of hearts around.

And when I had the perfect pair, I paid for it while opening a loyalty account. I could not believe how absolutely kind everybody was. Nobody, customer or worker, treated me differently.

This is a victory for me, because I decided I deserved to be kind to myself, be proud of myself, and nurture myself, not just the parts society has deemed appropriate to do so given my genitalia.

2019-01-30 07:41:58,alaff3,7,1,"Hi, I literally just made a reddit account because I don't know many other non-binary people and have had this kinda stirring in my mind for a while

So, I was AMAB, but I realized I was non-binary a bit over a month ago. It was a really crazy week, with thoughts constantly in my mind about what I was and why I was feeling the way I was. For a bit I thought I was trans, but I realized being a Woman didn't sound right either. That's when I did more research, and thought about it a bit longer, coming to the conclusion that I'm non-binary!

I guess the main thing I've been wondering is... what do I do now? I'm pretty young and don't want to immediately have everyone in my life seeing me differently or treating me differently, so most outward physical expressions seem to be a No at the moment. I've slowly (very slowly) been coming out to my close friends, which has been the right choice for sure.

2019-01-30 15:53:32,ale0c6,3,1,"I've known I haven't exactly been comfortable with myself since age 12. I never quite felt female, nor male. It took a while to discover the proper terms and whatnot, but, being somewhere in the middle always felt nice, like removing your socks after a long day, or finally feeling more connected to the person I wanted to be. 

I had a name picked out, one I still use today in online communities and with people I trust. 
It's masculine. Very masculine. It's Felix. A very stark contrast to the name I was given, which, surprisingly, is neutral, but it's not me. 

I had harbored this 'secret identity' name for years, and due to the frequency of online time vs. real life social interaction, I became Felix. It felt more natural to be called this than it did my birth name. 

Still young, I kept this secret. I kept it for years, really. 
Nearing adulthood in legal eyes, at age 16, in mid Fall, I decided I wanted to have a coming out for my name. 
My mother had already known something was up. 
My identity, both sexuality and gender wise, wasn't a secret, but it was kept swept under the rug. 

Lifting up the rug was hard. 
It didn't go well. 
The first time I hinted at wanting to change my name, it upset her. She didn't scream, yell, or break things, but the emotional intensity was all the same.
I had hurt her. It was my fault. 

Days later, we discussed what had happened. With tears in her eyes, she told me the story of holding me in her arms, her 'sweet little girl' and named me. Changing it would be removing something she gave me, a part of me that wad a part of her. 
We've always been close. This was like an arrow through my heart. I couldn't imagine hurting her like that.

Yet, inside, I was hurting. 
The topic was dropped, still simmering, a bubble in the rug that felt as if it would trip me at any moment. 

Time passed, the issue wasn't as hot button. 

It was Christmas soon, wounds still fresh in my mind, I was a bit emotional. 

We began to pull out the ornaments, handcrafted family heirlooms, at least to us. 
Many were painted, made by me. 
Many had my name on them. 

(Name)'s first Christmas
(Name) age 4
Mom and (Name)!

I felt the worst combination of emotions. Guilt, self disgust, like I was betraying my family. That I would be a new person, and if I changed, those made-with-love ornaments would only be an upsetting reminder for my mother. I didn't want to do that to her. 

That night, I sat on the couch with her, head leaning against her. 
I quietly told her that I did not want to change my name. It was a phase.
She seemed pleased. Relieved. 

I felt bad for lying, but that wad drowned out by the fact I had fixed her worries. 

It's February. The new year, I'm soon-to-be older. It's been nearly 5 years since I became Felix, yet I am only that in the closet. I am only Felix behind closed doors. 
And now, I know I cannot change, not without hurting the person I love most.

I have experienced gender dysphoria throughout my entire life. Wanted to be a boy from ages 7 - 10, quite intensely. However, this intensity gradually faded as I became more accustomed to my developing body.
Ages 13 - 21 was a hyper awareness of my sexual power and liberally explored this with men and women. Fell pregnant through rape by deception, had a daughter.
Fell madly in love with a woman in college. Everything great.
Go out with friends when girlfriend is visiting her mother. I was roofied at the club. Wake up battered and bruised. Make a statement but never followed through with it.
Life continues as normal but don’t deal with trauma.
Find out my girlfriends step father repeatedly sexually abused her throughout her adolescence.
27 years old get heavily into feminism, join local socialist party. Hate men with a passion. Feel victimised constantly. Gender dysphoria starts resurfacing.
Feel like I can’t protect my family from bad men. I start to hate my femininity. Identify as non-binary. Shave my head. Throw out all my feminine clothes. Start using a binder. Let facial hair grow out. Consider taking hormones. Researched constantly. Watching Ftm youtubers, following ftm people on all social media sites. Became obsessed.
My masculine identity starts to impose over my feminine identity. Don’t know who I am anymore. Get a lot of attention online. Online identity is confident, strong. But irl extremely depressed and angry. 
One day have enough. Completely remove myself from social media. Start going to the library. Read all I can about psychology, human behaviour, ideas. Starts to rewire my brain. Feel connected to myself again. No longer obsessed with my outwardly appearance. Feel strength on the inside. 
I’ve been building on that everyday since. I’ve found meaning in my life and I’m thankful.

Is there anyone else out there who can relate to my experience?
