2019-04-01 03:03:36,b7wigf,3,6,"Hey!

So, I'm 16, AFAB + nonbinary. I'm currently closeted, so often times, shopping sucks. My parents (who I can't come out to, due to them being cranky transphobes + homophobes) often immediately, of course, try shoving me into the most feminine looking article of clothing in the immediate vicinity. 

They already know I hate wearing dresses skirts (I've hated this since childhood), so while that isn't a problem, they still want me to look ""feminine"". I often hear things like, ""Look at this blouse!"" or ""You need to wear clothes that actually fit you right!"".

For context, prior to my most recent shopping adventure, I'd primarily walk around in these 3x men's t-shirts, seeking comfort in the fact that I was a shapeless entity in them. Why worry about binding when your shirt is too bind for people to notice? Who knows what your ""real"" gender is if your shirt is down to your mid thigh? It was the perfect system.

But! My parents wanted me to actually wear other clothes, + not look ""like a bum"". Cue me being dragged to a thift store a city or two over in the midst of a blizzard.

Once there, it was immediately apparent that there weren't many ""girl's"" clothes that fit me. I am 5'6, + hovering around 180lbs. So overweight. I also don't have much hip vs waist definition, so I'm much more rectangular than hourglass shaped. Almost everything I was forced into was either borderline too small, or too short. 

My dad then seemed to have a eurika moment. I was then allowed to go prance around the men's aisle for several minutes. I suddenly realized that I did, in fact, fit the lesbian stereotype of liking flannel. + button ups, in general! 

It turns out, men's shirts fit me a lot better! There's also less (I'm not sure the correct word here) ""narrowing"" in the waist portion of the shirts, which is nice! Most of them made me feel a lot more ""neutral"" than the rest of the clothes I tried on. + I was even allowed to buy them!!! 

This was a few weeks ago, but I thought I'd share. I've been wearing them since, + nobody's really commented on them (except for one person asking if I was wearing ""my dad's shirt""). My dad also got me men's jeans, which also seemed to fit me better. 

I am closeted, btw. So wearing more ""neutral"" clothes until I can do things like bind make me feel better!

Tysm for reading, + sorry if this is kinda disorganized! Have a great day / night!!! ^.^

So, let me preface this by saying that I do experience some dysphoria but most of it is easily manageable. I have disphoria about breasts, hips and my period. I wish I looked more androgynous, and fuck my period because I'm never bearing kids but the worst is my breasts, I don't bind, I tried, binding hurts and doesn't alievate my dysphoria anyway. They're fine, they're there, I wish they were way smaller but it's okay. I just don't want to take off my bra in front of anyone. I don't have bottom dysphoria.

I met a guy. He's gay, like... 4 or 5 on the Kingsey Scale. He's kinda NB too but I feel to a lesser degree than me. Less constant, should I say and most of his... gender play is sexual for him. He's probably more of a cross-dresser than NB I think. My point is, he's a bottom. And we're trying to fool around. It's kinda difficult. He likes when I act masculine and toppy. He has no urge to penetrate me, half the time I don't even really want him to because having something there feels unnatural (not bad, just... weird), and I don't have the means to penetrate him (yet).

Long story short, I bought a harness. And that's where my confusion lies. I never wanted to pack before. I think it's pointless, I don't want that squishy thing always in my pants, getting in the way. I'm fine with what I have, I like touching it, I don't want a dick 24/7, I don't want either top or bottom surgery, or hormones. But the idea of him feeling my erection (strap-on) through my pants and giving me a blowjob kinda turns me on (he is very much into that idea) and gives me euphoria? I think? Like, I really like the idea of having a dick for him that I can take off. I'd be fine with sex just being me fucking him. The idea of it seems so much more... natural. But I don't know if it's because I'm NB or because I'm admitedly kinda of an empathic person and whenever we're fooling around I can always feel he wants me to do it.

Basically, I don't know if it's a sexual thing, wanting to please him in a way I've fantasized about for a long time anyway. Like, women too can be into fucking their men... Plus, wanting a temporary dick, it's kinda a thing for some lesbians too, right? Walking around with it in their pants to be ready or feel powerful... Or if it's a NB gender thing. I'm pretty sure that if I had it on, I would be feeling myself up. I want to see it on myself, not just to please someone else, I wanna SEE it, you know.

2019-04-02 01:56:27,b8cw4j,7,14,"So this is going to be a long one. I'll put a TL;DR at the end.   


I'm 22, and just finally came out to my boyfriend as nonbinary. He is one of two people who know. But he is the first person I have told that it would directly affect.   


I have known that I wasn't just a girl since I was in my early teens. I learned what trans was and thought for sure that that was me. I don't know why, but I knew that it had to be me. I was probably 14 when I came out to my mom as trans. She lost it. She wouldn't allow it. She sobbed and sobbed, and made me feel so guilty. So I did what I always do. I tried to make it easier for everyone around me and just clammed it all up.   


I ended up having to do the same thing about being bisexual when I was 16, because someone in my christian choir group found out and told my youth pastor who told my mom. There was a family intervention, and I closeted myself again.   


Overtime I did realize that trans wasn't quite for me. I didn't really want to have a penis or lose my boobs. I just didn't feel like a girl all the time. I still kept it well squished down. In fact for the last 8 years I've avoided watching videos about it or looking at things. I did on occasion, but felt so much shame and pain that I decided to just avoid it.   


I have a beautiful boyfriend who is amazing to me. I can't believe I've found him. But I've kept this a secret from him too. I thought I could just keep doing this. Just keep pretending I'm just a girl and thats it. But I could feel myself becoming unhappy. I can feel this need to be free but I can't act on it. After all, what straight man would want an NB person for a partner? I really didn't think he'd get it. Especially by some of the things he's said in the past. (to be fair though, I fed into it trying to protect myself.)   


But it turns out, he is in fact not straight. I found out just a few days ago that he is bisexual. I was the second person to ever know. So i only felt it was fair that I told him my secret (he already knew i was bi). He was totally okay with it. He was actually so casual about it it struck me. It was the most anticlimactic thing, right next to paint drying (im not mad about it). I also realized it was the first time I really got to come out, and not be outted.   


  


So now that I know hes okay with it, and that I can do this.... I'm still terrified. I still have so much internal transphobia (I don't think thats the right term. I'm not trans). I've just fought myself about this for so long and now suddenly I don't have to anymore and I don't even know how to handle it.   


I have myself convinced I would be ugly as a boy, that i can't pass, and that people will hate me if i try. I was made to feel like something was wrong with me for so long I still feel like there is. Like I shouldn't be this way. I'm trying to break free. I want to break free. I just don't know how. 

&amp;#x200B;

does anyone have any advice or their own story to share? I don't know where to begin with myself. Feel like I'm trapped inside a body that isn't mine. I don't know how to fix it. I don't even know how i can express the masculine side of me.

Plus, I don't really know how gender feels. Like is that because I don't have one? Or do I have one and just don't understand it? The point is I don't know. I like identifying as non-binary, I think it feels *right* (but I don't know), but I'm still just plagued with doubt. 

Has anyone else felt similarly? How did you deal with your doubt?

To give a little context I came out to her about 2 years ago and we‚Äôve been having this talk since then. It mostly ends up with me feeling extremely shitty because she doesn‚Äôt accept me at all, refuses to use my pronouns, deadnames me all the time (she‚Äôs never called me by my preferred name or pronouns once) she has said all the things ‚Äúit‚Äôs a phase‚Äù ‚ÄúI gave you the name ______, it was a gift so that‚Äôs what i‚Äôm calling you‚Äù ‚Äúcalling you they isn‚Äôt grammatically correct‚Äù ‚Äú well what if I just decided to identify as a rabbit‚Äù etc etc. 

The difference is I was living in another state from her this whole time so it‚Äôs only ever been over the phone, now that I‚Äôve moved back to my home state I finally get to come out to my brother. Since he hasn‚Äôt had a phone and I‚Äôve been respectful of my moms wishes to tell him in person. 

So basically this talk we are having tomorrow is how I want to come out to my little brother (13) because *surprise surprise* she wants to be there when I tell him.

I've tried to exercise before in my binder, or even just jog at a brisk pace to catch up with friends, and I'm unsure if it's because of the disproportion between chest and waist, but I always get a very noticeable jiggle and do not feel supported despite being flat.

I am AMAB, and I don't reject the idea that I am a man - I'm not interested in passing as a woman, looking like a woman, or being seen as a woman, but I LOVE women's clothes, shoes, makeup, etc. I go through waves of wanting to wear dresses all the time, wishing I could paint my nails, feeling all in all pretty feminine - which is great, I actually really enjoying feeling girly, but I don't have a desire to physically transition or, like I said, pass as female. What gets complicated is that in my interest in women's clothes, I also find myself often wanting to wear bras, or put on some nice lingerie for a fun evening. Therein lies my problem - I don't need to pass as female, so I don't shave my beard (or chest or back for that matter), and to be out and about in a cute dress with a beard and boobs kind of defeats my purpose/identity as a guy who happens to enjoy wearing dresses.

I'm not sure how to fit the two together. There's just something about wearing a cute bra under my clothes that excites me (not sexually) and makes me feel more feminine than ever, but I feel like that's going ""too far"" if you will, since I don't have a desire to be seen as a woman.
I hope this makes sense and I don't sound like a lunatic, but this is such a wild journey of self-exploration and acceptance and this seems to be one of the hardest stumbling blocks I've faced.

Any of you lovely people experienced something similar? Any advice for getting past this?

So I\'m really nervous because I would be kind of ""trying it out"" since I\'m not sure how long exactly I would be doing it for - I wouldn\'t be doing it forever though, because I don\'t want to keep continuously going in that ""masc"" trajectory if that makes sense. Like, I want to take it to a point and then go off of it forever.

2019-04-04 06:51:01,b99dwo,5,11,"the pain of not knowing is so awful.  sometimes i feel really certain about transitioning to female, getting SRS, voice surgery, electrolysis.   then another part of me is afraid to let it all go.  like im betraying my desire to be female by saying that i sorta like having facial hair, sometimes.  but that same facial hair that i think looks good, i also get really dysphoric from.  im not sure if im attracted to it, or if i actually like how it looks on ME myself.   same with my adams apple.   then there's the feeling that its 'too late' to transition to female, since ill always have masculinized/testosteronized bone structure and voice.   obviously HRT and even voice surgery cant reverse that. and voice surgery is risky anyway.  and voice training, well, thats a whole nother mess for me.    

&amp;#x200B;

so sometimes i feel like trying to embrace my masculinity, ""own it"", seems like the right thing to do.  but then i feel like im denying myself true happiness.   so then that makes me think im definitely MtF.   but then again, when it comes to things such as genitals, its another mess.   apart from gender, i want to have a vagina.  but then, im sure ill miss what i have now.   and since my vagina wont be anatomically perfect, wont be anatomically the same as a cis one, well, that depresses me.  i have functional parts now, and i can get pleasure from them--so why should i change--the dysphoria is there, but still.  i feel like ill miss certain aspects of the parts once theyre gone.    thus, i dont think ill ever be 100% content.  it feels like a judgement of what will i like more, what i have now or what ill have after.   im always longing to have different parts, but once i have them, will i miss what i had before, grass is greener type of thing.   

&amp;#x200B;

i did try HRT for awhile, 2 years, but it didnt really make things better like i hoped. altho it didnt help that i was struggling with other things, so much so that i got myself gatekept because i sounded so unsure of HRT that my doctor didnt think it was right to let me continue using it.  im just so torn.  

&amp;#x200B;

i still struggle with internalized binary shit like feeling nasty doing 'feminine' things while hearing my low voice or seeing my reflection (that feels male).  for example, a person like conchita wurst. she's amazing, but i have an internalized reaction of aversion.  people might argue that that's some innate thing to be averse, or that its socialized, i dont really know. i see it both ways, but its kinda irrelevant at the moment i guess.   stuff like that is a struggle. its easy to wonder if i only want to transition so that ill feel socially 'allowed' to be feminine without judgement.   but i dont think its that simple, its just an irrational doubt that makes me think its that simple.  

&amp;#x200B;

i make up my mind, and then i unmake it up.  i could be so sure of myself that i could schedule an appointment for surgery, only to doubt it all the next day.   its easy for someone to say ""then youre not sure of yourself"", but thats not the case. its just how volatile i am that i can be so sure, and then remember something that i thought id gotten past, only to start being unsure again.   doesnt help that transphobic social things that i read while closeted years ago keep cropping up even in mainstream culture, like 'fear of regret', which i know isnt common, but its also why i haven't made progress, because i dont want to regret.  but i dont think ill ever be certain enough.    


long story short i dont feel content with my body and my social place, and i dont think i ever will.   sometimes i think i want it all, the privileges of men and the priviliges of women.  sometimes i think the only reason i want to keep my masculinity is because i know it attracts hetero women, and i view ""normal"" as hetero still.  biological essentialism and shit, its tough for me to argue against that because of something my biology teacher said, that the ""goal"" of life is to pass on our DNA.  even tho ""deviant"" sexuality occurs in other animals besides humans, its still considered deviant.  its considered a departure, a side route, off the straight and narrow path.  i mean the word straight itself, thats what i think of.  and yeah, i could take a trans-humanist view too, that its just biological programming and all that, and we could rise above our nature itself, but i also feel i kinda cant, since i just AM this living being, and its a mess trying to say ""well i think humans should use science to steer their 'evolution' this way or  that way, like how could i even make such a choice.  im addled by inaction.  i dont think im making much sense anymore.     


it just sucks.  my personality and identity is a fucking chameleon spazzing out.      


whatever i do, i feel like im enforcing constraints on myself.  when i try to be feminine, when i say, ok im definitely MtF, then i start imposing these restraints, where i excessively gender things. i need to act this way or that way, i tell myself, so that i will see myself as female, so that the world might see me as female.  yes tomboys exist, but i already am too masculine to be seen as a tomboy, if i try to do anything traditionally 'boyish' ill just be seen as a boy, not a tomboy.   i cant stop gendering things, my own behaviours, down to minutae, the way i sit/talk/walk/body language.    i think, ok, femininity is what makes me most happy.   but then im like not allowing myself to do masculine things.   but if i were to say, ok, im nonbinary, then i sorta just feel nothing.  like part of me WANTS the binary in order to feel like im female. then i feel like im guilty of what some TERFs accuse MtF women of, of reinforcing the binary.  

&amp;#x200B;

so for example, at the moment i feel this is stupid, im definitely mtf and i dont know why im here. but if i delete this post, i know ill start feeling uncertain again.   i know i can be a woman regardless of what i do with medical transition, or dont do, but thats not really the issue.     


ok, i guess im here because i cant help but conflate gender with anatomy.   sex characteristics, primary and secondary sex characteristics.   if i keep my facial hair, i FEEL masculine.  thats just how i am.  but regardless, i just dont know whether i want to get rid of it or not.  shaving it isnt good enough, but when it grows out a bit, its not so bad.  but sometimes i wish it didnt exist at all.  i wish i never went through testosterone puberty.   its because the parts i have are caused by tesosterone, that feels male and masculine, i guess.   so MAYBE its just that i know ill never be cis female enough to be happy with myself.   i always wonder what my body would be like if i couldve stopped puberty, couldve chosen the female route.   and since i couldnt, i feel ill never be happy with myself.  but thats when im feeling sure of being mtf.  other times its like, well, i dont know, i like how i look as a man.  it doesnt feel right, but it looks good.  idk if that makes me not mtf or not i guess. i dont want to be a fraud posting here, but honestly i just dont fucking know  


its like, my ideal self would be Tonks from harry potter.  able to change appearance and anatomy based on the moment.  but that ideal doesnt exist in reality.  i cant sometimes have hair follicles and sometimes not have hair follicles, cuz as far as we know, the human brain cant induce those types of physiological changes, and science (at least public science, to sound paranoid and crazy), cant do that either.  i cant sometimes have a penis sometimes not.  the best i could do would be to get surgery to have both, but even that isnt ideal.     


so i guess i just dont know how to cope with this.  there's no perfect solution.  it doesnt help that i feel myself getting older every day, and aging depresses the hell out of me, but thats sorta something else.

2019-04-04 22:49:40,b9jjji,19,1,"I'm a non binary AMAB gen X aged person and I've been thinking about this for a while while reading the posts here.

I see a \*lot\* of obsession with pronouns here and it has always seemed misplaced to me so I spent the last 6 months thinking about why I feel that way about it.

I think a lot of it is well intentioned but can easily cross into misguided and harmful to the non binary person but also to all other non-binary people in the world:

&amp;#x200B;

I see two big issues:

1) We are not \*a\* pronoun, we are gloriously individual non-binary people and no pronoun another person uses can possibly have any effect on who we are inside as non-binary people.

My gender is non-binary and nothing anyone says will change that, I can confidently take that to my grave, no one can change that.  

I may not look externally the way I want to or someone may say something shitty to me but it doesn't change who I am.

Pronouns are what \*other\* people use to discuss us with yet more \*other\* people, we are not actually part of that process directly; we are only peripherally involved.

At the end of the day we are still who we are and yes it sucks when people mis-identify us, but it's not the end of the world.  If a 70 year old grandmother can't remember you prefer ""they"" it should not be attributed to malice, it's just human nature.  If someone deliberately won't use your pronoun then they may be a shitty person, but that in no way changes who you are on the inside.

Don't get me wrong, I'm all for pronouns; we can and should ask people to refer to us by whatever we want but we have to also accept that we have no right to control other people, how they think or act and if they choose to not call us by the pronoun we requested then we need to accept that adjust our relationships if necessary and just move on.

Thinking that other people harm us when they don't use our preferred pronoun is painting ourselves into a corner mentally and emotionally.  It makes us weak because it hands over the control of our emotional and mental health to other people who may not have our best interests at heart.

Our energy is best spent cultivating our own inner garden so to speak and learning about ourselves and being as authentic as we possibly can and true to our nature.

&amp;#x200B;

2) There is a lot of hatred in the world towards visibly non-binary people right now.  It seems we are right in the cross-hairs  of the current culture wars and a target and we need to consider that carefully in what we put out into the world, both for ourselves but also for all the non-binary people that come after us or are in places where they can't be themselves.

Believing falsely that we have the \*right\* to control what words other people use is not only ironic and deeply wrong but it also generates hatred towards non binary people.

We should be better than that, we shouldn't hold hatred in our heart or spread negativity but instead be positive and understanding wherever possible.

Never attribute to malice what can be attributed to stupidity or carelessness.  Hold that attitude in your mind when you are misgendered and you will feel better and react better to the situation.  Obviously there are exceptions when people are being actively shitty but that's an opportunity for you to learn why from them if appropriate in a non-judgemental manner and also to show that you are not affected internally by it in any way because it doesn't change who you are.

It's not for their benefit, it's for your own mental and emotional health and it makes the world a better place for us all.

Being positive and not focusing on the haters and providing an example of how we want to be treated is the way forward.

I wonder how people know their trans or NB. I often feel like I *might be* but I also feel like I could just feel odd and different due to my underlying mental health issues and neurological disorder.  


A bit about myself. I have been diagnosed with Autism, depression, schizophrenia, and social phobia disorder (social anxiety). I never feel like I fit in and for about 6 months in high school I tried to live as the opposite gender. When I was about 8 (roughly) I tried to cut off my genitals as I hated them. Luckily I didn't actually manage anything as I only tried to do it with really blunt scissors. After I was diagnosed with Autism about a year ago, I figured that I just felt different due to that. However, more recently I've started having a mental crisis about it again. I feel fully comfortable with she/her pronouns (my gender at birth) but I feel like *sometimes* I would feel more comfortable presenting as androgynous or male, all while still being comfortable with she/her.

2019-04-07 06:02:00,badg17,5,15,"Hi everyone.

So long story short, I‚Äôve struggled with my gender identity my entire life. As a toddler and preschooler I used to call myself names that were associated with the other gender and dress in clothing for both male and female genders. Growing up I wondered I was trans, but I tried cross dressing in public and it didn‚Äôt feel right. I spoke very deeply with my SO about it all, and they suggested I dress ambiguously to see how that felt.

It felt so right. I have a very neutral face. Not one you‚Äôd confidently call male or female. I feel comfortable in female and male clothing, sometimes more comfortable in one than the other depending on the day, but most of the time I prefer being somewhere in the middle. I don‚Äôt mind my biological pronouns at all, I feel ok with them because it‚Äôs what I‚Äôm used to, I also really like they/them because it feels like it ‚Äúfits‚Äù if that makes sense. I also have a name that is very rare in America, it‚Äôs common in a third world country and so where I live it‚Äôs neither male or female predominantly.

Does this sound like it fits the definition of non binary? Did anyone else wonder if they were trans before realizing they didn‚Äôt want to be either? Is it possible to be comfortable with my biological pronouns but also with ambiguous ones? I don‚Äôt know what validates any of this, you know? Any input anyone can offer would be fantastic and super helpful. It‚Äôs been a long and rough journey and some advice would help ease the confusion, I think.

I was born as a male, and for the last 17 years, I have thought of myself as a cisgender guy. I am not remotely stereotypical (purple and blue are my favourite colours, I have no interest in sports, I love art and books, I think I would enjoy baking and knitting but have never had the time to get good at either, etc.) I think I am attracted to girls, but I haven't been in a romantic relationship and haven't been strongly attracted to anyone ever (of any sex). Recently, I have been thinking (I've been thinking for several months about this topic, and probably another month about how I want to phrase this and if I want to), and realized some things:

I don't think of myself as having a specific gender

I would not care if I suddenly had a female body. (note: I am perfectly happy with my body the way it is now, except for leg hair. I hate that and wish it didn't exist) 

I feel more like a male than female, but only slightly (I'm somewhere very close to the center of that spectrum)

Society definitely thinks of me as male


So with all these realizations, I have no clue of I am cisgender, or nonbinary, or something else. The internet's definitions are quite contradictory and confusing. Anyone here have a similar experience? Am I a incredibly confused NB person, or a confused cisgender person, or am I something else?

 I‚Äôm having an issue with how I view gender. I'm confused about what defines gender. For example: Things that fit my body and who I am just happen to mostly be things that our culture considers masculine, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm a man. 

Wanting a flat chest doesn‚Äôt make me a man. And just because I like painting my nails or am fine with a vagina doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm a woman. That‚Äôs just an activity and sex characteristic that our culture happens to correlate with women. 

So, besides biologically, what does it mean for someone to be a specific gender? If a woman didn‚Äôt have any sex characteristics and items/activities weren‚Äôt gendered, how would she know she was a woman?

Every single one of his arguments is easily disproved and I spent over an hour arguing with him as well as I could, providing articles and questioning his sources, but by the end I just said that certain statements are bullshit. 

The argument started when I mentioned my roommate and called them ""they."" He asked if they were a he or a she and I replied that they use ""they"" as a pronoun. He proceeded to say he ""hates that!"" So I questioned that statement with genuine curiosity as I haven't had reason to take offense from him before. He says that he ""believes in science"" and that trans people are ""living in a fantasy that doesn't align with reality."" I'm just so flabbergasted because he has been so supportive of me during hard times in my life, even if we lost touch for periods of time.

He doesn't know I'm non-binary because I have never felt the need to use different pronouns. I honestly don't care what pronoun I'm ascribed. And I didn't tell him the other night during the argument because I wanted to help change his mind without making it personal. Maybe I should have.

We are still on good terms (so to speak) because I believe he can come around, but I'm honestly overwhelmed by his entrenched stance based on fake news and lack of knowledge (when he truly believes he knows so much!).

And then there‚Äôs ones that really scare me. How do I tell my family? How do I navigate the world once I start passing (and have male privilege)? How would I tell potential partners about it?What if I regret it? What if I‚Äôm just faking it?

2019-04-12 16:05:07,bcfare,18,10,"I guess this might as well be something to get stuff off my chest. I'm 32 years-old, cis-gay-male. Very hyper masculine bear. 

&amp;#x200B;

Spent my whole life not really caring about gender or looks, I always had a unkempt and groomed, scruffy look. I was blessed with a career that I can actually not care about looks instead of dressing like a man. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last week I watched a video from [ThoughtSlime](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrr7y8rEXb7_RiVniwvzk9w) and there was a conversation about non-binary. And I cried, and it felt personal, and it made me remember things from my infancy. I kinda dismissed it but I kinda had this thing hanging in my head, it's hard to face the idea that I'd like to wear a dress. Cut my hair in a [fem-style](https://i.pinimg.com/236x/74/ed/7d/74ed7da35161c07d5098e5315587a65f--melena-bob-short-hairstyles-for-women.jpg). Paint my nails. Jesus, I even had this idea for years about dying my hair in [rainbow pastel colors after watching this video](https://youtu.be/ARH6P3MqmwQ). 

&amp;#x200B;

Then I'd think what people would think and dismiss it like some sort of silly vain desire. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today I decided to come here and as I look people's pictures I feel like crying again. My heart is racing. Is this dysphoria? Wiki states it as ' a profound state of unease or dissatisfaction', sounds like the story of my life. It seems so silly but at the same time, feels like something that causes me deep anxieties to flourish. 

&amp;#x200B;

And people saying they had this thing about being CUTE, goddammit, it seems only 8 years ago I managed to feel myself cute in my own shoes, usually wearing t-shirts with positive and kind characters, like Totoro, Unicorns and whatnot. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel old, like a pervert, like someone who is faking it, someone who should grow up. Ended up writing some stuff and realized I have this will I still be deserving of love if I become someone else? Would mom look me straight?

&amp;#x200B;

I remember having to change things about my looks, there was a time I used eye liner when going out, both friends and sisters kinda told me not to, at least to not freak my parents. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm here. Living alone for at least 6 years, paying all my bills, all my rent, all my shit. Graduating in 2020, and feeling like a scared kitty. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think I'm afraid of it all.   


I wanna go buy makeup after work. But I'm afraid I'll like it.

I'm sure many of you can relate: for me, trying to find/wear swimwear has always been a  long, treacherous journey through Willy Wonka's Dysphoria Factory.

This summer I really want to enjoy my time at the beach, so I was thinking of finding a binder to wear for swimming, and I know gc2b has said their binders are fine to wear swimming! Has anyone tried it or another brand? 

Basically my questions are, did it dry ok if you wore it after you got out of the water? Does it become see-through? Did it irritate your skin? Did you like it? or were you still dysphoric and I should give up hope and just wear a t-shirt? Lol. Let me know.

I am a 17 year old cis bi male. Currently dating a 17 year old non-binary AFAB person. I‚Äôve been with them for about 2 months now and it‚Äôs been absolutely amazing, there‚Äôs been challenges for both of us but it‚Äôs been a really great overall.

It was not until meeting the person I am with now that I became truly aware of the LGBT+ community, I already knew I had feelings for more than just women but was never really involved in the community nor even used the term bi to define myself. All my knowledge of terms and pronouns comes through them; throughout this piece I might use some incorrect terms or phrasing, I hope you look past them and focus on message of the words instead of the words themselves.

Throughout the 2 months I‚Äôve been hesitant to do ‚Äònormal‚Äô relationship stuff (intimate) that would typically occur in a cis relationship (all my experience even though very little comes from cis relationships), they are the first trans person I honestly have spoken to, or at least open trans. I was always fearful of making them uncomfortable or putting them in a shitty position through me being a cis male, and this also being their first relationship with a cis person made it hard for me to make a ‚Äòmove.‚Äô Even kissing them for the first time was something I had to give too much thought, I wanted to very badly but it was something that seemed to have so many extra layers it was overwhelming. 

I did take the leap though and I‚Äôm very glad for it; however it‚Äôs come to the stage where a new challenge has presented itself. For the sake of transparency I‚Äôll be blunt: Sex. 

We‚Äôve always openly talked to each other about things, and we‚Äôve agreed this is something we are ready for and want to do. 

That being said I am really fucking worried and have anxiety over the whole situation about some many things it unreal. I have never been the most confident person but anxiety is new to me. I am both overly happy and overly scared whenever I think about it. Me being a male with a penis, I know there‚Äôs a lot of negative light about my role in sex. ‚ÄòI go in, fuck and sex ends when I‚Äôm done,‚Äô I absolutely don‚Äôt want it to be this way, I want it to be fun for not just me but also them. I know they‚Äôve never been with a ‚Äòpenis‚Äô so I also feel like it‚Äôs even more pressure on me especially since I honestly don‚Äôt have most experience using it. 

So I guess my real question is to all people who might have been in the position I am; a cis person dating a non-binary person and how sex worked for them. I don‚Äôt want to misgender the person I am with and perform the wrong gender role. We talked about it briefly and came to the conclusion that we would try and incorporate both gender roles. 

Some other factors I need to consider include - 

They wear a binder pretty regularly, does this mean I can‚Äôt or shouldn‚Äôt play / touch their boobs? 

They want to get sex organ reconstruction, should I not touch / use the one they have now? 

They have mild dysphoria about their hips, should I just not at all go near them or just try to not touch them. 

Obviously none of these things are an issue for me, it‚Äôs just I want them to feel safe and comfortable.  

I realise that these are all questions I should ask them, however I don‚Äôt get many answers from them. The only thing I get is ‚ÄòI‚Äôm pretty much open to anything,‚Äô which doesn‚Äôt feel right. It feels like an answer you give to dodge your actual feelings on the subject.

It's great that event organizers are making specific efforts to include trans women, because they've historically been left out of some queer movements and culture. But, like, as a non-binary person, it puts me in a really weird, uncomfortable position, to the point that I'm leaning toward not attending.

Like, I'm pretty femmey. I wear makeup and I'm on feminizing hormones. But I'm not a woman; I'm non-binary. So am I expected to pay full price or trans woman price? I don't mind paying the full amount -- it's only a $3 difference -- but if the pricing difference is because they want to recognize the historic and continuing barriers faced by trans women, then I think I deserve discounted admission as much as my binary trans women peers. Choosing to pay the full amount feels like erasing that reality, and I guess ultimately feels like erasing a part of my identity.

But on the other hand, if I choose to pay the trans woman price, am I going to feel pressure to act more ""like a woman"" than I would otherwise act? If it ""gets out"" that I'm non-binary, will the organizers think I'm gaming the system by falsely claiming trans woman status?

But, like, as a non-binary person, it puts me in a really weird, uncomfortable position, to the point that I\'m leaning toward not attending.\n\nLike, I\'m pretty femmey. I wear makeup and I\'m on feminizing hormones. But I\'m not a woman; I\'m non-binary. So am I expected to pay full price or trans woman price? I don\'t mind paying the full amount -- it\'s only a $3 difference -- but if the pricing difference is because they want to recognize the historic and continuing barriers faced by trans women, then I think I deserve discounted admission as much as my binary trans women peers. Choosing to pay the full amount feels like erasing that reality, and I guess ultimately feels like erasing a part of my identity.\n\nBut on the other hand, if I choose to pay the trans woman price, am I going to feel pressure to act more ""like a woman"" than I would otherwise act? If it ""gets out"" that I\'m non-binary, will the organizers think I\'m gaming the system by falsely claiming trans woman status?\n\nI\'m sure there\'s an element of over-analysis or overreaction on my part here.

Identifying as non-binary is really causing them to struggle, because they have no idea how to start transitioning. Their birth name is very feminine and wants to change their name but has no idea when, or how, and is terrified to bits.

Besides that, they are very insecure about being female, and I‚Äôve been trying to help them transition smoothly but it‚Äôs very difficult and I just want a bit of advice?

so... i've been identifying as a nonbinary person for about a year now, but until this day i'd only told my SO and a couple of very close friends.

i'm slowly coming out at work and today posted a meme from [/r/egg\_irl](https://www.reddit.com/r/egg_irl), which has been seen by my superior and led her to ask me if i wanted to be called by different pronouns. i said i don't really care people using female pronouns at times, what bothers me is that those are *the only* pronouns being used.

she then said she'd call me anything that made me comfortable and i thought about using pins, *buuuut*...

i'm still figuring out where i truly lay gender-wise, not sure if i'm genderflux cause my presentation varies from andro to high femme to soft masc (if there's such a thing ?), yet **i know** i'm not cis, and presenting neutral/masc while getting only female reading/passing responses has been a huge bummer for the longest time.

so idk if i want a pin for each type of pronoun, one for all of them or just an ""ask me"" :|

i'm also kinda nervous about truly coming out because i'm not sure i can explain how i feel/who i am to people

I'm a masculine-leaning fluid enby. My aesthetics is basically 'cute androgynous femboy'. I feel masculine-leaning about 95% of the time and feminine-leaning the remaining 5%. I'm only dysphoric about two things : my voice (doing voice-training for that) and my boobs. I wear a binder almost everyday and I can't make up my mind on whether I want top-surgery or not.

The problem is that 5% of the time when I'm feeling feminine. More precisely, I like having a flat chest when I'm clothed. I like looking like a cute boy or simply a man. But when I'm naked... I like my feminine silhouette. I have pretty nice boobs actually. I always get plenty of compliments on my nude pics.

If I had the power to switch boobs on and off whenever I want I would leave them off most of the time. So it would make sense to remove them... but at the same time, do I want to do a surgery I would regret 5% of the time ?

I could just keep on using a binder. But sometimes I can't wear it for a couple days because it starts hurting and those moments suck. There's also sports where I can't wear it and it sucks. Swimsuits are okay, feels like lingerie/being naked for me.

Since my childhood I have never been able to fit in the sex and gender I was born in.
It never mattered to me as a kid as I just lived life.

As I grew up I realised that gender in general didn't matter to me in the slightest.

I discovered as well that I was pan, because if gender doesn't matter to me, then why should it for the person I love?

My question now is, I am grown up and I feel extremely uneasy in my body.

I feel like I am not myself in the body that I am in and I was wondering if you guys have some advice in gender exploration? Or not even gender but how you guys feel better about yourselves?

What do you do, or what is your story?

I really wonder, because I feel confused and lost. It is scary.

""Transgender people often think about gender all the time, and because of that intensity we‚Äôre able to offer insights that often run counter to some prominent feminist theories.

Chloe Schwenke is a transgender woman. She introduced a panel of transgender poets at AWP - a writer's conference I attended this year - AWP being an organization that she now runs.

I personally don't feel as connected to gender as she does - but this quote really prompted some thinking for me.

2019-04-19 15:38:03,bf0iys,5,8,"Hi, I'm been participating in the various transgender communities for a while. A really good community. I've seen a lot of postings regarding ""am i trans"".. This is a slightly different posting.. as in.. trying to figure out what my body is trying to tell me re non-binary vs mtf. 

It is not clear to me that I am MTF.  I don't have a desire for GRS. However, i do feel a strong desire to at least start on HRT, but this is not possible where I live.. Well maybe i can get the estrogen, but the anti-androgens and medical support is a different issue, and not driven enough yet to consider administration without expert assistance.. Also, it may be very difficult with border control if my face no longer matches my photos, and the little i know is that change in gender markers do not go down well here \[ nearly impossible to change any local government paperwork \]. 

For three years i  wear skirts/kilts every single day religiously. In the last few months i'm wrangling with home laser hair removal (tria) full body.. I seem happy enough to undergo intense pain for beard hair removal, so something is obviously driving me to do this without regret or reservation. \[ The professional hair laser removal salons are .. well.. not trained on Male beard hair removal in this region, so wrangling with doing it safely myself \] .

So given the above, i'm doing the simple things that i can... wear increasingly fem / tom-boy clothing, and remove hair.. At what point do you discover if this is enough, or that you need to push through to hormones...  Stated another way, my body is demanding every day to feminize, towards some tom-boy look (which is impossible for my body to look fem while dressing masc without hormones).  Did people in the non-binary community find that their body was ""demanding extremes"" but kinda mellowed out when you got half way?  Or did you find it was more ""no, the changes i needed to do always felt more middle of the road / androgynos / other, demanding as hell, but it did not feel like a push towards full femm?"".  I also know that some people are gender fluid, which may be at play to some extent, but the demand for HRT from my body is not fluctuating. 

My complication is that different aspects of my body have independent opinions. Mind says non-binary / tom-boy, my emotional frame is a balance of male and femm, my social side says i do not want to be associated in the mainstream male group,  and my body is screaming fem as hard as possible.  I know it is possible to be trans femm non-binary .... i guess i'm wondering, if that body level drive is going to calm down as i femm more, or if it is going to scream at me for HRT every day till i comply. or do i have just to wait, do what i can, be patient, and ride the wave as it unfolds in whatever way it is going to.

A few years ago the girl I was dating insisted on calling me Emily and it stuck. While I don‚Äôt inherently have a problem with going by Emmy, I feel like being able to identify as nonbinary and everything I have gone through since high school has made me a totally different person, and therefore I should have a different name.

The past three years of my life have been a drag. Finding out that I'm bisexual was hard enough, but I've been totally fine with that for some two years or so now. Questioning my gender, however, has persisted and worsened significantly over the past two years.

I told myself it didn't matter. That I'm just a confused girl who will get over it. That's it's just a phase. That it's not real. That it's not worth even pursuing.

But I still feel very much like shit a lot of the time.

When I'm fine, I'm fine. Meh, girl stuff is close enough, whatever, whatever. When I'm _not_ fine, _damn_.

I just want to talk about the stuff I feel that may be dysphoria or may just be teen misery and hormones (hell if I know; I'm not a therapist).

Like my hips, I can sometimes be okay with, but generally I don't really like. My chest pretty regularly bothers me, sometimes just a bit but sometimes _obsessively_ (I bind pretty regularly with the camisole method). I dislike my voice about half of the time because I think it's too high and then the rest of the time I'm neutral. I pack sometimes because occasionally, I somewhat feel like I'm supposed to have different equipment than what I do (I've noticed on these masculine days where I do choose to pack, I feel more at ease with myself and more confident). But in the end, I'm sometimes okay with just being a girl, or sometimes a gnc girl. I wouldn't say I'm ever wholly satisfied with it ‚Äî typically just neutral, but neutral is _so_ much better than discomfort. 

I've generally felt like I fall somewhere under the NB umbrella. I constantly fluctuate between identifying as NB or just GNC, and sometimes fluctuate between whether or not I even think NB is real (I believe it is, but sometimes I tell myself it's not in the hopes that my mind will force the possibility out). 

I continuously police myself and think that there's no way, and I'm bullshitting myself, and I just want attention. So I hate myself for not being what I think I should be, and then I hate myself even more for not knowing what that even means.

2019-04-26 14:31:28,bhmxyu,8,20,"This is my first post here,

Okay, bear with me because this is going to take a while.  I just felt like I was at a place where I am ready to share my full story about my discovery.

I am 33 years old, I recently started exploring my true self and realized that I am NB.  This was around early December.  I was born with male genitalia, but a lot of the time I feel like a girl, and thus enjoy dressing in Women‚Äôs clothing, including unmentionables.  Before, I always did in private and would wear it under my male clothes even keeping it from my wife.  I was scared and unsure about how the people around me would react.  The first week of December the wife and I were hanging out and having a conversation about something related to movies and I brought up a romcom that I enjoy and had been reminded of by a phrase.  My wife jokingly called me a girl, because I like Rom-Coms and pretty much any other Chick Flick.  (When I was younger, I waited until my parents went to bed and watched ‚ÄúThe Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants‚Äù on one of the movie channels.  My parents are pretty conservative and my dad would have been freaked out by my enjoyment of such a film.)

Anyway, back to the story, my wife said I was a girl because I like romcoms because she thinks most of them are sappy and lame.  I was feeling particularly girly at the time, and her saying that for some reason made me feel really good.  I know she did it in a picking way, but something about her tone made me feel more comfortable in that moment.  Also, I was stoned and feeling pretty good already, so I decided to inform her that I actually feel girly at times and sometimes wish I could be more feminine.  I even explained to her that sometimes I sneak into her closet and wear her bras and undies under my clothing, and at times I‚Äôve borrowed a top or two.  She was totally cool with it, had a few questions, but was totally cool with it.  Then a few days later, I told my mother in law and brother in law who live with us.  I am still not comfortable with telling my conservative parents, especially my father.


To continue the story, since we were just a few weeks from Christmas, my wife decided to surprise me by getting me a few pairs of girly underwear, some hipsters and a few thongs (I‚Äôm a grower not a shower, so as long as I‚Äôm not erect they fit pretty well) and she put them in my stocking.  She also told me that I can wear any of her clothes at anytime, except for one specific pair of leggings that is her favorite.  I have never felt more comfortable in my skin, I feel like I can be who I want to be.  I still wear Men‚Äôs clothes to work and when I‚Äôm feeling more masculine, it is about 70/30 right now, 70% of the time I feel like I can identify as a female, and when I do it is nice to be able to dress that way.  I have longer hair for a male and I usually pull it back into a ponytail, this way I can still feel a little girly even when I have to dress like a guy,

I know that a lot people outside of my home would judge or ridicule, so for now I only dress feminine on my days off, when I‚Äôm at home.  I did run out to the car with a top and leggings on the other day and it is the first time I‚Äôve left my house with a pair of leggings on.

Anyway, just wanted to share my story with you.

Have a nice day.

Long post warning! I want to apologize in advance if I say anything that offends anyone, that is not my goal. I am uneducated and I want to learn. TLDR just below

TLDR: A student just came out to me as NB, but isn‚Äôt open to everyone yet. I need advice to help support them, especially because they aren‚Äôt out.

I am a high school choir director (as you can probably tell by my name, I needed an excuse to make a ‚Äúwork‚Äù account, and this is the perfect reason) and yesterday a student came out to me as NB. I try to be supportive of ALL students in my class, and in the performing arts, I have quite a few LGBT+ students. Until now, I‚Äôve never had a student that is NB (at least to my knowledge). When this student told me, they were understandably nervous and in tears, as they have only told a handful of people and most were not supportive (including best friend and mom).

As I sat and heard them open up about who they truly are, I tried to be careful about when and how I spoke. I wanted them to be able to explain everything, as much or as little as they wanted. You see, I‚Äôve NEVER had to do something like this, so I can only imagine how difficult this is. I‚Äôm a straight male, I‚Äôve never had to justify myself to anyone. I only interrupted to stop self-deprecating comments, because‚Ä¶ well that one‚Äôs obvious. They spoke about how their mom doesn‚Äôt understand, and just wants them ‚Äúto be less of a tom-boy‚Äù. I know I can‚Äôt interrupt their dynamic, because I‚Äôm a teacher, so that part is very difficult for me to help with. Then a lot of things hit me all at once.

I have been part of the problem. Like most choir programs I have gendered choir names (Men‚Äôs choir/ Women‚Äôs Choir) and I have gendered choir uniforms (tuxedos and dresses). I currently have a Trans student, and they wear their preferred uniform and sing in the gendered choir of their preferred gender. I‚Äôm being supportive and inclusive, right? Well I thought so, until this smacked me in the face. I began asking a ton of questions (in retrospect may have been poor timing on my part) like ‚Äúdo you feel uncomfortable with the name of your choir? Do you feel uncomfortable with your uniform? Would you rather wear the other gendered uniform? Would you rather wear something completely different as your uniform? When I say ‚Äúladies‚Äù or ‚Äúgirls‚Äù in class do I make you feel uncomfortable?‚Äù I wanted to know what I could do to help, then the other thing came into play. **(Are these the right questions? What questions did I miss, or shouldn‚Äôt have asked?)**

They aren‚Äôt out to everyone yet. They have only told a few people, some of which haven‚Äôt been receptive to their identity. They don‚Äôt want me to make a bunch of changes, because they feel that it will bring a bunch of attention to them, and they‚Äôll have to deal with that. I want to be understanding of that. I don‚Äôt want them to open up until they are ready. This isn‚Äôt about me. I made it clear that if this helps them feel more comfortable I have no problem changing the names of the groups or the uniforms, and I‚Äôm willing to fight that battle against anyone else that disagrees with me because, well, this is my choir program and I can run it however I want! I am totally fine with them wearing a tuxedo in a choir full of dresses. They said that they don‚Äôt want to do any of that right now because they aren‚Äôt out, and it will only cause more problems with their mom (it sounds like mom doesn‚Äôt really understand any of this, and thinks its a phase. Dad isn‚Äôt really in their life, except for summers). I told them to think about all of these things and when they feel like they know what it is that they want to let me know. I don‚Äôt want to push that decision. The last thing I asked was ‚Äúwhat is your preferred pronoun?‚Äù To which they quickly responded ‚ÄúThey/Them‚Ä¶ Woah I can‚Äôt believe I just did that!‚Äù That was an awesome thing to be able to witness.

So here is my overarching question: what can I do to help a student that is NB without drawing too much attention to it, because they aren‚Äôt out yet? They are pretty new to this Non-Binary thing, so they are still figuring them self out. How can I help them on that journey?",NonBinary,Choir Teacher needs help supporting NB Student,1556317019.0,"{'created_utc': 1556291819, 'id': 'bhngra', 'num_comments': 25, 'score': 23, 'selftext': ' \n\nLong post warning!

I feel like I am not prepared to explain NB to people, and that they will just use my vague answers as a way to invalidate NB people. 


Anyways...


A visibly GNC person came in with their partner to our restaurant last night. They were treated respectfully etc... but when my boss returned from taking them to their table he began to talk about the GNC person. 


‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt understand... I guess I can understand trans people but...‚Äù 


He wasn‚Äôt disrespectful (he is a cis gay man) at first, and has a very rude sense of humor that is pretty dry. We are good friends and talk outside of work (maybe a 10 year age gap?). He never would have said this in ear shot of the customer but somehow after my vague deflections(  ‚ÄúI understand it‚Äôs a difficult concept for some people‚Äù ‚Äúas long as you are respectful to them, that‚Äôs what matters even if you don‚Äôt agree or understand‚Äù etc. ) he made a joke essentially calling them a freak. 


I was visibly uncomfortable, and I know he didn‚Äôt mean it in a hateful way but it was still sad to hear. He asked me to explain it to him because he didn‚Äôt understand...


So after 30 seconds of stuttering out loud and debating in my head what to do...


**I came out to him!**


I told him that I‚Äôm very closeted but I identify as NB, that she pronouns are fine with me since he has been using them, but other NB people may feel strongly about their pronouns and they should be respected. I told him that I have a really hard time explaining it to people, and I am afraid of judgement, which is a big reason as to why I don‚Äôt come out to people. 


His response was really positive! He asked me to explain it more to him sometime when I feel comfortable, and that he doesn‚Äôt disagree or want to invalidate NB people; he just doesn‚Äôt understand and doesn‚Äôt know where to start. 


SO IN CONCLUSION:

What are some easy, low reading, low stress links videos pictures, or anything really, that I can show him? 


I don‚Äôt want to overwhelm him with sources but I want to explain it in a way that summarizes being NB, and leaves the door open for him to learn more if he feels he needs to!!!

He asked me to explain it to him because he didn‚Äôt understand...\n\n\nSo after 30 seconds of stuttering out loud and debating in my head what to do...\n\n\n**I came out to him!**\n\n\nI told him that I‚Äôm very closeted but I identify as NB, that she pronouns are fine with me since he has been using them, but other NB people may feel strongly about their pronouns and they should be respected. I told him that I have a really hard time explaining it to people, and I am afraid of judgement, which is a big reason as to why I don‚Äôt come out to people. \n\n\nHis response was really positive! He asked me to explain it more to him sometime when I feel comfortable, and that he doesn‚Äôt disagree or want to invalidate NB people; he just doesn‚Äôt understand and doesn‚Äôt know where to start. \n\n\nSO IN CONCLUSION:\n\nWhat are some easy, low reading, low stress links videos pictures, or anything really, that I can show him? \n\n\nI don‚Äôt want to overwhelm him with sources but I want to explain it in a way that summarizes being NB, and leaves the door open for him to learn more if he feels he needs to!!! \n\n\nI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm comfortable bringing it up in person and explaining, but maybe you guys have some good suggestions :)', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'My boss made fun of a GNC person at work, so I came out to him...', 'created': 1556511481.0}"

It's all donated clothes so I knew the chances were slim to none, but I haven't been able to buy a binder, nor have I been able to apply for those free/cheap binder programs.  
Why didn't I ever apply for those programs? Well, as it says on one website....

""**Please only make a request if you are truly in need of one.** ""  
I never felt like I was truly in need of one. Sure, I had some chest dysphoria, sure, I knew I was nonbinary, but there was going to be someone out there who needed it more, who had worse chest dysphoria than me, and it was wrong of me to try to take a binder from them. So, I didn't get one. I dealt with awkwardly fitting shirts and bad days and took it all on the chin. I figured, ""I wouldn't even wear it that much. It probably won't look the way I want. It probably would hurt.""  
And then, I went to the clothing swap, and found a black, XL, gc2b binder.

I couldn't believe how happy I was with how I looked in it. How euphoric I felt. How my shirts looked with it on. I'm wearing it right now, and it feels so so good. I've smiled every time I've seen myself in the mirror. Don't get me wrong, I still love my breasts. But being able to look the way I do right now has given me more euphoria than I knew I could have.

So, to the person who donated this binder: thank you so much. It is going to be very very loved.

And to anyone who was feeling like I was, like you don't deserve a binder, like you aren't ""trans enough,"" like you don't have enough dysphoria: you are trans enough, and you deserve everything that will make you happy. **You** are the person truly in need. I was lucky enough to get one, and if you feel like you want one, and can't afford one, you absolutely should apply for one if it is something you're interested in. If you can afford one but are hesitating, I recommend giving the gc2b ones a try.

To everyone reading this: you are enough.

2019-04-30 02:45:23,biy8my,7,6,"Hi all. I've been dealing with gender for a longgg time and is one of the parts of my identity that has been the hardest to understand for myself (especially in comparison to my sexuality, which didn't take me long to figure out I'm queer AF lol). Also, if this is posted in the wrong category then my apologies and I will delete/change it! 

I am FAB (born female at birth). As I've been thinking about my gender more, I knew I was at least non-binary/non-cis/genderqueer. I considered trans/trans non-binary, but when I delved deeper I realized I kind of want to ""reject"" gender altogether. I'm not sure if that makes me agender or something similar... but that's why I'm sharing to hopefully figure it out!

A big part of this is when I started to do more research on the pathologization/medicalization on queer bodies (esp queer people of color, like me). I have experienced this within my own health and sexual organ complications growing up. To confuse things even more, my body didn't develop as it ""should have"" during puberty as I had hormones that made me look more masc than feminine. I know that sex =/= to gender, of course. But I can't deny that a lot of those traumatic experiences have pushed me to not want any genitalia at all and dis-identify with all gender entirely. 

All of those experiences also contribute to my body dysphoria. I've been called m'aam, sir, boy, girl, etc and even though I don't snap at people or feel especially upset, I don't really feel comfortable with any of those words or pronouns. At the same time I feel more patient with this in other queer spaces vs. out in public because at least other queers are quick to correct themselves and very apologetic since we can all relate to the importance of being referred to properly. I currently have adopted they/them as my go-to pronoun. 

Still, it doesn't help that I'm curvy, have a full breasts, and a baby-face that ""give away"" that I'm FAB. Again, I know gender expression/performativity are not the same as gender, but in my case I feel it's an important part to mention within my experiences of gender exploration. It seems no matter what I wear, how I feel, makeup or no-makeup, I will always be perceived within the binary or even not being enby *enough* :( It also doesn't help that I'm taking classes on topics of different discourses on sexuality, gender, etc which only confuses me more :')

At the same time I feel more patient with this in other queer spaces vs. out in public because at least other queers are quick to correct themselves and very apologetic since we can all relate to the importance of being referred to properly. I currently have adopted they/them as my go-to pronoun. \n\nStill, it doesn\'t help that I\'m curvy, have a full breasts, and a baby-face that ""give away"" that I\'m FAB. Again, I know gender expression/performativity are not the same as gender, but in my case I feel it\'s an important part to mention within my experiences of gender exploration. It seems no matter what I wear, how I feel, makeup or no-makeup, I will always be perceived within the binary or even not being enby *enough* :( It also doesn\'t help that I\'m taking classes on topics of different discourses on sexuality, gender, etc which only confuses me more :\') \n\nI wanted to post this to see if others could relate and to see if agender is truly where I fit- or not! aha.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'lost in gender', 'created': 1556617523.0}"
