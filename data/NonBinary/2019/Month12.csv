A few months back, before I even made the decision to return to femme presenting, before I had decided to bring up gender with my counsellor and look into HRT, she got in my face out of nowhere and asked if I was trans. I shooed her off because I had the sense this was about her desire to ""call it"" and ""know"" me better than I know myself, and fundamentally don't feel safe discussing intimate topics with her. That was the last gender-related interaction I've had with her.

Until Thursday. With a mildly stuffed bra and fabulous makeup I knew she'd probably ask me more invasive questions and probably even get pissy about me not telling her I was going to transition. But I was not prepared for what she actually did. Me, her and my oldest sister were all sitting there talking about makeup when Mom said she couldn't believe my lip was still the same color as it had been when she arrived. So I explained that I was protecting it with chapstick, and reached for my chapstick in my shirt pocket. I fumbled. She reached for it. Her hand paused on one side of my chest, then reached for the other and paused there too.

She f\*\*\*ing groped me. We didn't say anything, but I've since spoken to 3 of my sisters and my companion about it, just to reality-check and validate myself because I started spinning into dissociation and self-doubt and accusing myself of overblowing things and disloyalty and all the family insanity is just spinning in my head.

I'm also spending energy trying to convert my anger into sadness to protect myself from the enmeshment shame of feeling angry with my mother. But I want to feel angry. And the two are tangled up. I'm sad because she wanted access and sharing, and by reaching for it the only way she knew how she now has a giant stone wall between her and what she wants from me. A wall of anger. The only way we have a relationship of any kind at this point is if we meet in a public place, I tell her I don't accept what she did, and she apologizes. But she's going to go nuclear if I arrange for that kind of confrontation. 

So at this point I'm really working on accepting that she's dangerous, in a way that I thought she wasn't anymore, and also accepting that the most likely outcome is going to be zero contact for a good while, which kills me because of my enmeshment-based attachment to having a ""relationship"" with her (but might be good for me for that same reason).

Y'all. I really need hugs. But hey-I-see-you's and insights and experiences and hopeful things would be helpful too. I don't really have any question beyond that.

2019-12-02 14:57:09,e505r8,13,1,"Hey friends. I've been doing a lot of thinking about gender identity lately and am still knee-deep wading through the murky waters of it all. (For context, I'm mid-20s and AMAB.) I don't think I'm ready to really adopt a label of ""nonbinary"" yet (and I don't know how actually much this – or labels at all, or pronouns, or *words* in general – actually serve to help me or do any work for me personally, though they can help make certain ideas… coalesce, or feel more real) but I do feel NB-ish. I say this as a lot lot lot of stories I hear from NB folks resonate with me in a lot of key ways, and when I hear or read about people who identify as NB, genderqueer, etc. talk about their ideas, concepts, and experiences with gender identity, I feel there's a lot in common, especially in this whole process of questioning and figuring these sorts of things out. So – while I could go ahead decide to call myself ""nonbinary"" right at this moment, sure – at the end of the day I don't think that would do enough to help me figure stuff out; I think this doesn't change anything, as it doesn't help me with my conception/relation to my own gender identity or what that actually *is*.

The whole ""not feeling nonbinary *enough*"" thing is extremely real for me, I think. I'm AMAB, and still think of myself as sort of ""weakly male"" (?) – I guess because at the least I've just been so used to that as the unquestioned norm for so long, despite never thinking of my ""maleness"" (in my own conception of it, pretty far from anything stereotypical though, which I've always been aware + pretty proud of) as really part of who I am as a person at all… Anyway, in regards to being AMAB, I'm finding it hard, as far as gender *presentation* goes, to actually *present* less male just because, for people designated or viewed as male, and because of society/history/culture, maleness – not some conception of ""neutral"" – is the default.

I don't want to perform stereotypical femininity by painting my nails or wearing dresses or earrings/jewelry or stuff like that (and I sadly can't grow out my hair either even if I wanted to try that out), I just want to… take away some of that masculinity. To quote the graphic novel _Gender Queer: a memoir_ by Maia Kobabe (which I only discovered after having essentially all these exact same thoughts myself months prior): ""I don't want *more* gendered traits, I want *less*."" But unfortunately I really don't think there's a way to do this because any gap or ""lack"" of gendered traits *is* the same as that default-maleness, for someone AMAB, or viewed to be as such + ""filled in"" with that.

It'd be great if I could look more androgynous (even though that in itself feels sort of ashamedly like ""playing the game you claim you don't want to be a part of"") but it seems mostly unachievable for me, so oh well. I do think people AFAB have a lot more flexibility to perform/express gender in a range of different ways (and that are more socially accepted too, although I know this doesn't really matter, but interesting to note) and I sometimes feel a bit jealous of that.

This all sort of connects to my main point or question which is that I'm wondering if anyone else, in some way, relates to the phrase ""I'm an [insert whatever here] who wants to be to be a girl who wants to be a boy,"" or finds that somehow productive in describing their feelings. Or flip those two genders, whatever. This is a little weird because I recognize it's dealing with some pretty binary views of gender, more than I usually think of it as (which is why I find some trans spaces, especially IRL, not… super relevant to my experiences, with MtF or FtM as common experiences that feel a lot… neater, or easier to describe + imagine, in some ways). However, there's some work this statement is doing in exploring identity and desire together, and wanting to (comfortably) be in this sort of in-between or maybe-not-quite-perfectly-achievable state…?

I'm also reminded of this quote from Jeanette Winterson's _Why be Happy When You Could be Normal?_: ""My sense of myself as being a girl who’s a boy who’s a boy who’s a girl. A doubleness at the heart of things."" Just a random aside, I guess, but thought it worth mentioning as a related thought or idea.

Sorry for the huge wall of text! Really did not mean to type this much, oops. Essentially any thoughts about any of this are super super appreciated. I don't even know *if* I feel stuck, or confused, or lost, or what – or if I'm sort of OK with that, in this hazy, liminal state – but I definitely want to make more sense of this all and talking with others or just reading about others' experiences helps a lot.

Ok brief background in why im asking this,

This week my girlfriend has started talking about the fact that shes been questioning her gender identity these past few months, i knew something was up, and that shed started seeing a therapist through some lgbt network recently, but i didnt know it had anything to do with gender identity, and it came, quite frankly, as a very big surprise.

Im honestly a bit lost right now and am not sure what to really do with that information yet as she seems very set on keeping all of this to herself until shes finished her own journey on thinking this over and comming to terms with whatever shes feeling right now.

BUT i want to help make her feel better somehow . and so another aspect of whats been troubling her recently is her style of dress so i suggested doing a sort of ""queer eye"" thing where we go through her wardrobe, throw out everything old and ill fitting and then go on a massive shopping spree, probably buying some more a-gender style clothing that she might be more comfortable with.

I offered to try and source together a big collection of reference images of outfits and styles she might like to guide us on our shopping quest, but this is where i need your help, cause im not finding it very easy to find looks shes into, so....

tl/dr

Would anyone here be willing to share some of their super cool gender queer clothing looks that they rock? or different style references/models i can find online?

Shes 28, and is looking for a style more ""professional"" than the wardrobe she currently has. She likes jumpers, neutral colours and looking like an adult.

Being 23 presents aren’t really a thing anymore but my mom always asks me to pick out like a couple things I might need for winter like boots and a coat, and I should feel grateful and loved my mom will buy me these things

But then being presented more masculine options makes me feel weird because when I’m not home I generally present more femme ( see my pics on my profile for an idea of my fashion).

But there’s another thing when my mom asks me to go into my closet and start looking for an outfit for Christmas Eve, and on Christmas Eve we have our whole damn family over. 

My moms guidelines since being back home for the first time in 2 years since being away at school are this and verbatim she said 
“Pick something conservatively styled that you won’t regret in pictures”

But basically I don’t own a lot of masculine clothes, I’m at a loss and I don’t want my mom buying me anything but I love seeing my extended family and I don’t like dressing like I did over 2 years ago.

I just don’t want to have dysphoria on the first Christmas Eve with my girlfriend and my first one back home.

But I don’t feel comfortable enough ruining the whole night and wearing something my parents will be embarrassed by even if some of my less strict extended family wouldn’t make a comment.

I really would love presents that I would love and feel cute in, maybe I will just wear what she wants and donate after Christmas and buy myself something cute in a few paychecks.



I’m just stressed.

2019-12-04 09:47:56,e5wxj1,14,1,"Hey. Sorry for a negative post on what is generally a really positive sub.

I'm AFAB and gender fluid. I've been having a lot of trouble representing my masc side. I know that deep down, its about how you feel, not how you dress, but I'd like to look how I feel, you know? So, I've been trying to dress a bit more masc. Here are my issues.

* Everyone asks me why I look like a lesbian. I'm obviously not taking the right steps in the right directions

* I've spent so many years of my life being valued for my body, that wearing masc clothes feels wrong. I look at myself in the mirror in my more masc-clothes, and I think, yep, this is it, I'm looking like a man, that's awesome.... and then I look down, and I instantly feel, idk, ashamed? Like, I'm not revealing enough skin or wearing tight enough clothes. I was shamed about that a lot growing up - people used to tell me how ugly I was unless I dressed borderline slutty. So even though I like what I see in the mirror, when I look down, I just feel despair.  

* I'm too scared to go shopping. I tried once, and felt so shamed by the shopkeep that I went home and cried. I'm bound to my femme wardrobe. It's hard when you look like a woman (a lesbian at best) and you want to browse mens clothes. God I wish there was an lgbt clothing store that didn't ask questions or make sideways glances.

* It feels hopeless. I feel like a lot of people don't understand gender fluidity. I think people are coming to terms with transitioning from one gender to another, but being both? I feel I will always be labelled a woman because I have a vagina. 

The other day, I was filling in some forms. The gender question came up. I initially ticked the 'other' box, and I was so proud! Then I thought... laws change in this country and bite gay people in the arse all the time. This could ruin me. So I went back and changed it. I'm a coward. And I'm sad. And I really just need someone to talk to tbh. None of the people in my life know. I'm deep in closet. And I really just feel shame.

Thanks for reading. You guys inspire me everyday to be more true to who I am. You're all so beautiful and I hope to post a pic of myself as a man sometime soon.

I'm obviously not taking the right steps in the right directions\n\n* I've spent so many years of my life being valued for my body, that wearing masc clothes feels wrong. I look at myself in the mirror in my more masc-clothes, and I think, yep, this is it, I'm looking like a man, that's awesome.... and then I look down, and I instantly feel, idk, ashamed? Like, I'm not revealing enough skin or wearing tight enough clothes. I was shamed about that a lot growing up - people used to tell me how ugly I was unless I dressed borderline slutty. So even though I like what I see in the mirror, when I look down, I just feel despair.  \n\n* I'm too scared to go shopping. I tried once, and felt so shamed by the shopkeep that I went home and cried. I'm bound to my femme wardrobe. It's hard when you look like a woman (a lesbian at best) and you want to browse mens clothes. God I wish there was an lgbt clothing store that didn't ask questions or make sideways glances.\n\n* It feels hopeless. I feel like a lot of people don't understand gender fluidity. I think people are coming to terms with transitioning from one gender to another, but being both? I feel I will always be labelled a woman because I have a vagina. \n\nThe other day, I was filling in some forms. The gender question came up. I initially ticked the 'other' box, and I was so proud! Then I thought... laws change in this country and bite gay people in the arse all the time. This could ruin me. So I went back and changed it. I'm a coward. And I'm sad. And I really just need someone to talk to tbh. None of the people in my life know. I'm deep in closet. And I really just feel shame.\n\nThanks for reading. You guys inspire me everyday to be more true to who I am. You're all so beautiful and I hope to post a pic of myself as a man sometime soon. I love you all. &lt;3"", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Need to vent; advice welcome', 'created': 1575478076.0}"

2019-12-04 21:31:12,e66aqc,6,1,"I'm wondering, what does IDing as trans actually mean to people? I've seen the definition of 'being a different gender to your AGAB' around and I honestly don't know how I feel about that in relation to myself. 

It's almost like IDing as trans makes me feel a level of social dysphoria, because it acknowledges that I lived as a different gender. I have a couple of binary trans friends who actually feel similarly - they're super trans-positive, but feel personally that using the label 'trans' outs them in many contexts, or otherwise feels dysphoric. 

I definitely don't feel like someone needs to be 'trans enough' to call themselves that, it's pretty much just a personal thing. I feel like I was super nonbinary in presentation and identity as a young kid, then only started performing my agab during teenage years due to social pressure. It's almost more as if those awkward teen/young adult years were a transition I have now detransitioned from back to being nonbinary. Though saying that in itself maybe casts transition in a negative light, which isn't how I feel at all.

I use they/them pronouns, have changed my name, am not on HRT but would probably like to be at some point, and have had a gender-confirming surgery. I even have a medical diagnosis of dysphoria. But those things don't make me 'trans', so it feels like it would be weird to start describing myself that way suddenly. 

I dunno! I definitely don't mean this as an attack on anyone else's use of the term, I just can't figure out if it's useful or even possible for me to identify with or not. I get that it's totally fine for me to not use it.

2019-12-05 02:12:38,e6a84k,10,1,"So, this is a question about people’s feelings, etiquete (if you will), and I hope I can express it well enough to get my question across.

This is a question about talking about non-binary people who use masculine and feminine pronouns, but NOT they/them or neo-pronouns.  I’m sure most of you saw the news about Billy Dee Williams, and I was excited to share that news with people in my life.  But while I was sharing it, I found myself sharing in a way something like this:  “BDW came out as non-binary!  *He* said in an interview that he is ‘himself or herself’...” et cetera and so on, and it made me think...

Now, when it comes to handling gender fluid persons, or bi-gender persons, or anyone who uses he/she traditional pronouns, I typically handle this in different ways depending on the person and context.  If it’s someone I know personally, I will ask them how they prefer to be referred to in general.  Over the long-term, I might switch up the pronouns randomly to accommodate, a la “My friend Devna just got his first car that he paid for with his own money, and she is super excited that is has heated seats” (that may be on the nose, but it’s just an exaggerated example). Or if this friend changes their expression sometimes or often, I might use only the pronouns on that particular day that they seem (to me) to be expressing, or just ask them what pronouns they’re using today, that sort of thing.  

But when it comes to talking about a stranger, there are certain pitfalls I can avoid.  I might say “so and so is a person who...” or “so-and-so is an enby who...” that sort of thing, as opposed to saying “is a guy who” or “is a woman who” and what-not.  But while I recognize in the first situation regarding BDW I can write it off as “Well, I say he/him because that’s what most would assume of him/her or his/her agab, and so it makes sense when talking to people who aren’t well-versed in trans and NB lives”, I still feel as though I’m playing into a bias that definitely exists to place weight on assumed gender based on societal norms.

So, after all that long-winded set-up, my question is:  Do y’all have a preferred way of handling this situation?  Obviously each of us have our own preferences; I consider myself a he/she enby, but my expression and identity skew masculine (and I have a lot of years of assumed-cis baggage to unpack...), but maybe there’s a more general protocol I am overlooking.  Is the answer to tend to lean towards the opposite of the assumed in order to reinforce non-binary legitimacy in general (I.e BDW is AMAB and most people assume him/her to be male, so to use she more often to compensate for bias)?  Is the answer to simply use that oft-hated colloquial device of saying he/she (As in: “Did you hear BDW came out as non-binary?  He/She said that he/she uses himself and herself to refer to himself or herself” (seems a bit unwieldy and contrived to me))? Is the answer to switch it up as I talked about above? Or, perhaps the Occam’s razor answer, am I just over-thinking this entirely? Lol. I hope this question doesn’t come across as being in bad faith, and I want to stress that I’m only asking this question in reference to discussions about a non-personal association (a celebrity/stranger/et cetera), but I’m always curious what the community at large feels about these issues.    I care about language, and about people and their realities being taken seriously, and I always want to speak in a way that helps to passively make talking about non-binary identities more casual/normalized, so that’s where this question is coming from.

 1. What are your pronouns? 

2. Why do you use those particular pronouns, and what do they mean to you? 

3. Are there any neopronouns that you have seen that you found silly or unnecessary? 

4. If neopronouns didn't exist and you had not invented them, what would you use? Would you be comfortable?

2019-12-06 09:25:25,e6wikj,0,1,"Okay, I realize with a title like that I may be around some transmascs to come defend themselves. I say so as an expression of frustration with my own experience, since T has given me a LOT of grief over the years, and to me, the downsides *seem* pretty universal.

I know that it's not important that I understand why transmascs are the way that they are. All that is important is that I *respect* their judgement call that more masculinity is an improvement to their lives, and that they are not obligated to make me understand in order to justify their existence.

But dangit, I *want* to understand, even if no one's obligated to explain it to me.

So here's the thing: I'm on HRT, and have been telling estradiol (estrogen), progesterone (the Other Female Hormone), and spironolactone (anti-androgen/testosterone suppressant). My endo said that progesterone is an anti-androgen on its own, so once I got my T levels down, she wanted me to try going off of Spiro. This is quite reasonable, since Spiro has plenty of side effects that it would be nice to avoid if there's need for them.

(I realize this is transfemme 101, but I wanted to make sure everything was covered.)

So I stopped taking Spiro, as directed. But I suspect the progesterone isn't enough to suppress the T on its own, because I've been feeling a familiar sense of aggression and impatience — one that hounded me from 1st puberty until I started T blockers.

I have very little patience. I get irritated at little things. The other day I went over to visit my somewhat mentally unbalanced older sister for her birthday, and her microaggressions, ignorant assumptions, and stupid jokes started to grate at me *so much* that I was having difficulty not saying anything. And after I went home, I just wanted to isolate myself and be irritated.

How the heck do transmascs handle these intense feelings (and lack thereof, when it comes to everything *but* anger and aggression)? I can't see it as anything but a downside...

Anyway, I'm going in tomorrow to get my levels tested. Depending on what happens I may go back on Spiro. I'll take a big hit to my libido, like before, but I'm starting to think that the trade-off is worthwhile. :/",NonBinary,Why on Earth does anybody actually WANT testosterone??

2019-12-06 22:21:22,e75jmn,3,1,"Hello fellow enbies! I have had a difficult morning that left me with some frustration and some questions. Coming out to strangers is always a mixed bag, and can result in some very uncomfortable, or sometimes hilarious, conversations. On multiple occasions I have had people start using they/them in place of ""you,"" and corrected them. Who knew pronouns could be so difficult for the layperson? The absolutely most uncomfortable-yet-positive interaction I have ever had with someone about pronouns happened to me today.

I just had a dentist appointment, and as soon as we began talking I told them a little about myself. Namely that I identify as, in my words, ""not a woman, or a man, but non-binary,"" and to please use they/them instead of she/her (I'm AFAB and look tomboyish, it's a common mistake). I was then asked ""what sexual orientation is that again?"" 😬 and how to use they/them in conversation, which though slightly annoying and misinformed was definitely in the right direction. I corrected my dentist again saying that my Gender Identity was Non-binary, and to please use they/them just like if you were speaking about a general un-gendered patient, e.g. ""the patient needs x procedure, the patient has y condition."" My dentist finished what they were doing and proceeded to tell their assistant ""she prefers they/them pronouns and her sexual orientation is called non-binary."" I almost yelled across the office but decided it would be too disruptive to correct them at the time. For the remainder of the visit, my dentist referred to me solely by my name, slipping up a couple of times with ""she-- I mean, [my name].""

I felt like I wasn't listened to very well, but I see potential to educate my dentist further on my identity and how to respect my pronouns. What are your thoughts, and does anyone have any advice on how I can reinforce that my gender identity is GENDER not SEXUALITY, etc.?

2019-12-07 04:59:48,e7a4fx,4,1,"Hey ya'll,

So heres my current situation. I identify as genderfluid but much of my identity is male, I say when I have to label myself *""trans masculine genderfluid""* I go by he/him pronouns and even was on T for 2 years when I identified soley as FtM but have been off for 3 years and had top surgery a few years ago. So I've been around a bit when it comes to gender, I've had time for discovery and really defining who I am. 

With all that being said, because I'm not on T anymore, I don't ""pass"" which I really don't care about- yes it sucks being called she/her/miss/mam and all of that but whatever because I love my female presentation (when the time calls for it and I am femme for that day) I have always gone by/identified with he/him and always will.

My girlfriend of a year just came out as a trans woman not too long ago and has been on estrogen for 5 months now. I've always felt conflicted in our relationship because even when she identified as a cis male I never really felt ""manly"" in the relationship. Back then we were ""boyfriends""  that label usually always fit, but because of the fluidity of my gender sometimes I would request to be called ""his"" girlfriend or other times we would just flip flop and use whatever came out if I was in an ambiguous stage and didn't care what I was called.

So my issue im struggling with is: ***I don't feel that my male identity is being validated enough and I don't know how we as a couple are supposed to work on it.*** She has always seen me as male ie; using my pronouns and referring to my anatomy as I prefer it to be called- so she's never done anything wrong, she's actually the most supportive human ever. But I just feel like because I am constantly invalidated in my daily life by the world that even the few people that respect me as male that I talk to on a daily basis, just doesn't stack up at the end of the day and I still feel like I'm not enough.

We've had this disussion before and there isn't an easy fix, its not like I want her calling me ""handsome"" and ""muscular"" and saying how  ""manly"" I am and shit all the time, but I just dont always feel like the guy in the relationship and therefore feel lost and essentially invalidated. And like I said, with her now transitioning THAT dynamic is changing and makes stuff messier because now I have to affirm her and make her feel comfortable, accepted, validated and seen, and we are essentially a heterosexual couple *(****but we don't necessarily view it that way because of my fluidity-sometimes, VERY rarely it feels like a lesbian relationship and I have felt very dominant and masculine at times its just not consistent)***

I just dont know what to do. I know a lot of is it internal work I have to do to find peace within myself, ***but as far as our relationship do ya'll have any ideas on how she can affirm my male identity more?***

I genuinely love the idea of this book for children, and would have definitely helped me and many of us as children, so let’s give it to our future generations!

The introduction to the book reads as follows: 

“Pally the Non-Binary Platypus is a picture book series aimed towards children from the age of 8 to 12 year old.  The series follows Pally as they explore their own identity and the struggles that come along with being different than how others see you.  Each book is dedicated to a different aspect of the lived in Trans experience. Subjects including pronouns, experiences at the beach, dysphoria, being misidentified,  and exclusion.” 

I would LOVE to have a copy of this book in all libraries, both personal and public, and that’s where you folks come in. 

Perry the Platypus needs help financially for illustrations, formatting and graphic design. 

I ask of you to help out with making this a thing! Please feel free to look around the Indegogo and possibly donate if you can, it is SO close to its $2k goal!

I am asking this for my best friend, they're afab non-binary (for the record, I am a trans man).

My friend is in the last phase of their medical education, and will be a doctor soon. They're 27 atm. They have had top surgery and have taken testosterone for about 3 years, but have now quit that because it wasn't what felt good. This means that they could grow facial hair, but shave every day because a beard/stubble doesn't feel good to them.

The further they get with their studies, the more they notice that they are often not taken serious (also by patients): people ask for another doctor because they would be 'too young to know', etc.

This feels really bad to them (and will probably only get worse when they're an actual doctor), and now they are looking for tips on looking older/more mature, especially for/from non-binary folks. All the things I find on google are super cringeworthy and VERY gendered (""grow a beard""/""wear makeup"")... Also tips apart from clothing, since in the hospital they wear designated doctor clothes...

I'm 21 (22 in 2 months), afab and non-binary and I've been identifying as such for the past 5 years. I was underweight for a long time so was able to get by ignoring most of my dysphoria for a while. I feared getting hips and a ""chest"" at 4th grade, and it only worsened from there. Over the past 2 years I've put on some weight, and am now no longer underweight. But it's been really challenging. I'm having gender dysphoria I didn't even know I had. Even my voice has started to bother me for the past 2 years, which wasn't a problem so much before. Though recordings always felt like I was listening to a little girl speaking which felt very very wrong. I just feel like I never grew up ""correctly"". But I'm definitely not a man. I enjoy being mistaken for a boy, it makes me feel androgynous and valid, but being called He, brother, man, or son doesn't feel right. 
Anyway. A friend of mine started T about a year or two ago, and I felt heavily influenced by them. Before this, I didn't know that T was an option for non-binary people. I felt jealous of my friend's changes. I felt jealous about my brother's hips and jawline too. I feel like I got the short end of the stick on genetics, and wound up with a demure little girl's face. I'm scared T will make me look like a mixture of a man and a baby. I'm scared my voice will be annoying, as I always found my brother's voice extremely annoying and loud. I have autism spectrum disorder, so I'm a bit awkward and have a lot of sensory issues. I'm scared T will make my sensory issues unbearable. The oiliness, sweat, itchy stubble, acne, bottom growth, voice pitch changes causing discomfort with my hearing... It's already painful raising my voice right now, I'm scared it will become louder and more painful on T. I'm just concerned that T won't give me the changes I want. Or because I wasn't born a cis male, that I don't get to have things like a smoother sounding voice. Forgive me if this is really insensitive, but do ftms voices sound crackly forever? I just can't seem to find any trans masc folks whos voices came out not crackly. 
Sorry for the wall of text. Anyway. I went to a gender wellness clinic last week with the intention of starting T. I went to a gender specialized therapist for about a year prior, stopped going around January because of money issues &amp; also I didn't feel like I learned much from the therapist that I couldn't hear on the internet. In fact, I felt more support through the internet. 
The clinic nurses told me the effects of T which I knew already from my friend and videos, and a nurse showed me how to inject myself. Did not get to actually inject myself though because my blood test results haven't arrived yet due to the holiday. So I'm currently waiting for my T prescription. She is starting me on a low-dose of T. The way I see myself is kind of like a feminine guy. But currently, dressing feminine or growing my hair out gives me gender dysphoria. In the long term, I can see myself growing my hair out and painting my nails, and exploring with makeup after being on T enough to not feel like I'm a girl or be perceived as such. Thing is. It's hard to separate body issues from gender dysphoria. Things like feeling it's unfair that I have a small jaw and big lips due to poor tooth alignment, feeling its unfair that so much of this, of hormones, is either one way or the other. I'm scared I'm going to become hideous. I'm scared of getting back and shoulder hair, and neck stubble. I don't know if other enbys feel this way, or if this is just a fear of gaining weight that manifested itself into me thinking I'm trans. All I know. Is that I'm not coping well with having a bigger butt, thighs, and hips when I gained weight even though I'm just 2 pounds above being underweight. What the hell am I doing? I just feel so separated from my body, at this point it's a separate entity for me. The only thing for certain is that I'm uncomfortable, and 100% sure I want top surgery.

I'm a cis/queer person and I wanted to ask y'alls opinion on the term ""Non binary lesbian"". it's been floating around as an argument on the internet but I have only heard one side of the argument.

I deep down prefer to identify my sexuality as queer, which for me feels like it allows me to not identify my sexual attraction by others' gender. I guess you could say I'm pan if you prefer, and I normally just tell others that I'm bi because most people are familiar with the concept and I've noticed most people don't tend to fight me about the existence of bisexuality as they do about pansexuality or my use of queer.

I dunno, because while I'm okay calling myself cis, I also feel I'm non binary, but I often think I'm not? Not sure if I'm making sense.  
  
A while ago, while thinking about my gender identity, I figured out that I'm mostly genderfluid, with me switching between fully female and being mostly female but a bit non-binary at the same time, so bigender, being female + non-binary.

**CONTEXT** 
So.... I identify as Bigender/general enby. I changed my name in high school (not legally). For privacy’s sake, I’m going to use somewhat similar names and spelling, but not my actual name, because I chose my new name based on my birth name. Let’s say my birth name was something like Amanda, and I decided to go by Amei. Well, 3 years have passed and I’m starting to feel like I resonate more with the spelling Amae. I’m unsure of how I’d go about making the change and dealing with peoples perceptions. 

I also go by my birth name with family, and I feel like if I spell it this way, perhaps they’d be more inclined to use my new name. I am also pretty cis passing, and not anywhere close to androgynous... and honestly, going by Amei has opened up the pathway to transphobia online, and because I’m white, there’s also been times where people have assumed I’m appropriating other cultures using this name. It’s a very tough subject for me. I don’t want to be problematic, and I think this is partly why I’ve lost touch with the name... I also associate it now with much darker times in my life, and going by Amae would feel lighter.

2. If so, what was your experience like?
3. In your opinion, is it worth it, or should I just stay status quo?

2019-12-08 23:56:02,e81pq3,4,1,"Hey all, I'm Lem! I'm new to reddit so I'm not entirely sure if I'm posting this in the right spot... Anyways, what brought me here was questions. I've been uncomfortable with myself for a while and recently discovered that I was ace and since then I have been more content with myself. However, since then, this sense of dysphoria has reappeared that I haven't met face-to-face with since early high school.

A little backstory:

I am AFAB and I'm not necessarily against that or the pronouns, to the point where I lose sleep over it that is, aside from the fact I absolutely despise my chest. Looking in the mirror, my chest seems so out of place compared to the rest of me that I imagine how life would be without them. Even when I first started going through puberty at 13, my first thought was that I wouldn't have a flat chest anymore and I was devastated... At the same time, I wouldn't mind keeping them.

I also feel similar towards dresses. I always hated dresses - feminine clothing that my mom would buy me and I'd never wear. The only thing I feel happy in are jeans, t-shirts, and sweatshirts that I wear literally everyday. Every now and then I find myself tugging at my sweatshirt to hide my chest, a habit that I started in high school. Recently, I wanted to wear a white, button-up shirt to my mom's wedding but had to wear a long, sunflower dress and couldn't even enjoy the wedding because I was too focused on the dress. 

Makeup is a big one for me and I never had the desire to wear it outside of halloween. I asked a friend of mine to do my makeup and I ended up crying over it because even though I asked her to do it, I hated it. In my junior year of highschool, I cut my hair short for the first time. My mom hated it, told me I looked like a boy, but having my hair short was so liberating and I've had so much confidence in myself since then.

I used to wonder the idea of being trans but at the same time I don't necessarily feel completely like a man, and yet I don't feel completely like a woman either. Like I said, being called female or male pronouns don't bother me either nor do they appeal to me.

Anyways...

I guess my questions are: Am I non-binary? Am I something else? Could I be just a tomboy? Am I actually a woman who's just over-thinking all of this?

If someone could at least point me in the right direction, it would be so greatly appreciated...

I've been uncomfortable with myself for a while and recently discovered that I was ace and since then I have been more content with myself. However, since then, this sense of dysphoria has reappeared that I haven't met face-to-face with since early high school.\n\nA little backstory:\n\nI am AFAB and I'm not necessarily against that or the pronouns, to the point where I lose sleep over it that is, aside from the fact I absolutely despise my chest. Looking in the mirror, my chest seems so out of place compared to the rest of me that I imagine how life would be without them. Even when I first started going through puberty at 13, my first thought was that I wouldn't have a flat chest anymore and I was devastated... At the same time, I wouldn't mind keeping them.\n\nI also feel similar towards dresses. I always hated dresses - feminine clothing that my mom would buy me and I'd never wear. The only thing I feel happy in are jeans, t-shirts, and sweatshirts that I wear literally everyday.

2019-12-09 13:27:44,e89y2w,6,1,"LONG POST:

So i went to my grandmothers house this last weekend to help her set up her christmas lights. She's 78, i do this for her every year. Trust me, not because i like to  but because its the right thing to do as she is elderly and needs help. 

Anyways, ive been openly NB for about a year now. There was an incident in july at her birthday party. I dressed a little more fem as im (amab transfem pre hrt, but starting soon).
This particular day in july i wore some makeup, a black solid vneck womens blouse, capris, and wedge high heels. Makeup and nails painted, i felt cute until.....

My prejudice uncle comes in and sees me, starts yelling at my grandmother, making her cry, she seemed ok with me being me, but i knew there was some underlying feelings. So he comes in, argues, shouts and screams at her, picks up a chair from the dining room table and slams it on the ground, breaking the chair, takes my aunt and cousin who is 13 and not openly bi yet. And leaves. 

So i cut him off right then and their for good. You wont be rude to me, my family and especially not my community for being who we are. I havent talked to my uncle since, and vowed never to be in the same room again with him, and havent. 

So i go over to set up lights this weekend and i asked if i need to come over for our family christmas on a different day because he would be there the day she had christmas planned for. She said, ""no, i just dont want you to do anything stupid"" after some other words she says this. And this is where im torn. 

""I want you to come, im ok with this (touches my face) and this( touches my nails) and this(gestures towards me)"" (this day i went over i only had on high heeled combat boots, skinny jeans, a tshirt, and nails painted with a little makeup. Basic NB lazy day look. Nothing fancy. My normal look wouldve been a blouse or yoga pants or something much more femme a dress or skirt etc.)

Then she says this. ""I just am not ok with a dress or high heels"" ""SO YOU DONT WANT ME. YOU DONT WANT ME TO BE ME!"" i responded. I was hurt. Visibly and emotionally. Your telling me "" wear what you want, just not these things."" FUCK YOU, ILL WEAR WHAT I WANT BECAUSE ITS MY BODY. i was irate. Me and my girlfriend finished up her decorations as best we could. She took us to lunch, dumped on us that she might have colon cancer and that me and her are the only ones in the family who knows and to not tell anyone. 

But here's the thing, its not beyond my family to tell horrible lies to get someone to come to an event because ""it could be their last event."" My family is toxic and sick i know, but what if shes telling the truth? 

Im so torn, i had a dress picked out with cute heels, and she told me i cant be myself. Then tells me she might be dieing and has only a few months to live (we are waiting on test results to find out) and if i dont go to the christmas event, i may very well miss my final time having Christmas with my grandma.

It upsets me dearly that i cant go as myself and that my entire family dosent understand me being NB and what that means even after explaining in depth how i feel about my self. I want to go for my grandma and be respectful and just go in boy mode.
But I KNOW FOR A FACT the first time i see my uncle, we will have words. Words will turn into action in the form of me becoming violent with him and ruining everyone's holiday. 

Sorry for the rant, but needed information to answer this question: 
Am I wrong for not wanting to go to this even though it could be my grandmas last christmas? Im so torn, i just want to be accepted for me no matter what i wear. I wish i was on HRT and a year in so i would have a more femme body, maybe then shed accept me for who i am.",NonBinary,"Ugh, need help with the grandmother",1575923264.0,"{'created_utc': 1575898064, 'id': 'e89y2w', 'num_comments': 6, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'LONG POST:\n\nSo i went to my grandmothers house this last weekend to help her set up her christmas lights.

She took us to lunch, dumped on us that she might have colon cancer and that me and her are the only ones in the family who knows and to not tell anyone. \n\nBut here\'s the thing, its not beyond my family to tell horrible lies to get someone to come to an event because ""it could be their last event."" My family is toxic and sick i know, but what if shes telling the truth? \n\nIm so torn, i had a dress picked out with cute heels, and she told me i cant be myself. Then tells me she might be dieing and has only a few months to live (we are waiting on test results to find out) and if i dont go to the christmas event, i may very well miss my final time having Christmas with my grandma.\n\nIt upsets me dearly that i cant go as myself and that my entire family dosent understand me being NB and what that means even after explaining in depth how i feel about my self. I want to go for my grandma and be respectful and just go in boy mode.\nBut I KNOW FOR A FACT the first time i see my uncle, we will have words. Words will turn into action in the form of me becoming violent with him and ruining everyone\'s holiday. \n\nSorry for the rant, but needed information to answer this question: \nAm I wrong for not wanting to go to this even though it could be my grandmas last christmas? Im so torn, i just want to be accepted for me no matter what i wear. I wish i was on HRT and a year in so i would have a more femme body, maybe then shed accept me for who i am.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Ugh, need help with the grandmother', 'created': 1575923264.0}"

So, I'm not attending my family's Christmas celebration this year due to several family members expressing discomfort with my refusal to present exclusively masculine.  I came out to them around this time last year and wore a nice dress to the gathering and everyone seemed fine with it then.  Over time it seems that the realization this isn't a phase is setting in, especially since I've started HRT, and since I've grown confident in wearing silicone breastforms a lot of the time.

I'd like to put together an educational package for them with a handful of books that will help my conservative Christian family understand what I'm going through, how to cope with the shattering of their world views, how to be a good ally, etc.  The target audience here would include adult cis males and females in their 30s and 60s, cis male and female children in early adolescence, and one cis female kid around 7-10.  

This package will also include a card explaining that I love them and want to be comfortable around them and want them to be comfortable around me, and that hopefully the contents of the package will be a start towards that goal.  My one sister so far has been very supportive and eager to learn and understand throughout all this, so I'll designate her to deliver the package.

Does anyone have any recommendations on books that would be good to include?  I'm looking on Amazon right now and see some that might fit the bill, but it would be nice to hear from anyone else who has given books to family members for a similar reason.

2019-12-09 20:55:22,e8fw4k,1,1,"~~^((Or whatever, I don't know what to fuckin' call it.))~~

So, basically, I've had this idea in my head for some time now. Years, even. Only problem is that I haven't had the idea of where to begin with it. This is most likely going to be a giant text wall of random information, but if you want to have freedom, it might be worth the while to keep reading. 

I'll start with yakking about myself for a small bit: I've had the displeasure of being alive for 20 years now. I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when I was 8 years old, and later with depression, anxiety, and selective mutism at 12 or so. (Although at this point in time, I think I have those plus PTSD, Autism, and Bipolar.) According to modern society, I've been identified as an agender, asexual, aromantic for about 4 of those years. I prefer to keep things simple and non-discriminatory, only being known as ""human"". And this is where this ""cult"" aspect of things will come in. 

I'm sure the greater part of people reading through this have an issue or 10 with the way society and governments are. I know I do. Having these useless documents with names and genders you can't associate yourself with. Not wanting to use a public restroom for the sake of degrading your own self. Idiots assuming and shouting false pronouns and/or names at you. Even assumptions about your age, race, sexual orientation, and whatever else someone can harass you with. 

So, I started thinking. And, yes, originally all this was just an idea for some fictional tale I wanted to slave over writing one day. But I also started noticing more posts about people wanting to get away from it all. Wanting to run away from the abuse, the discrimination, the absolute bullshit the world has become. I begin to think, maybe, my idea wasn't as crazy as I thought it was.

I've never been able to perfect all the aspects of it, (not having any friends really puts a stop to things), so take some of this with a grain of salt. 

I wanted a loving, accepting community hidden away in a forest somewhere. Years ago, before all of this came up, I had envisioned an almost cyberpunk city in the middle of nowhere, full of solely LGBTQ+ people. I've recently changed to more of an Old Nordic tribe feel. Seems a bit easier to manage, really. Certain traumatic events in the past 4 years of my life have let me to believe I should narrow the group down to being only humans who use neutral pronouns, and have no sexual preference, if any at all. Perhaps if I could really get this thing going, I might be willing to accept others again. But I'm still not quite sure.

I should probably just give a list of what I saw this community being. I'm sure there's plenty of things missing, and most things could be changed. But as I said before, I haven't had anyone to help me with this.

Without further ado, here is what makes up the *Frel* society:

&amp;#x200B;

* **Values**: No living thing is above another. There is no discrimination against gender, sexual orientation, physical age, weight, race, etc. (To a certain extent, none of things exist anymore.) 
* **Ethics:** There is strong belief there is no true “good” or “evil”. (Within their own community. Someone who doesn't have the same values is immediately hated and wanted dead.)
* **Division of Labor:** “Work” is not about earning a salary, and is instead about surviving. Jobs are not spread internationally, and are based on the settlements in which people live. These jobs can include, but aren’t limited to: farming, foraging/scavenging, hunting, and construction. People are allowed to have whatever work they choose, and are not forced to have or not have a job.
* **Trade and Money:** In the case a group comes across another with the same views, bartering of goods may occur. This does not happen often however, and there is no set way of what will trade for what. Money is irrelevant.  
* **Clothing and Adornment:** A balance of random modern clothing and natural items. Natural items include, but aren’t limited to: skulls, plants, seashells, and gems. Different types of bags are worn when foraging or scavenging. Makeup/face paints are common. 
* **Shelter and Dwellings:** Shelters can be fully made of the environments surroundings, a mix of natural and man-made, or in very rare cases, fully man-made. The buildings are often quite small, only large enough for about 3 or 4 people.  
* **Government Structure:** Anarchy. There is no higher groups of people, there is no market or income, there isn’t much of anything. There is the rare, occasional trading of items between friendly groups, however it is not set in stone what trades for what or when a trade opportunity will arise.
* **Law Enforcement:** There are no specific “laws” or “rules” written in stone anywhere to follow. If a person is suspected to be guilty of disrespecting the others of a settlement, they will be followed and observed for a while to expose the truth. If they are found to be guilty of this, they are held for further questioning. If the settlement comes to conclusion they should be gotten rid of, they are either permanently exiled or tormented and killed in a public show in brutal ways. If a settlement comes across a group that does not uphold their beliefs, they will kill without hesitation. (This is the largest questionable idea I have. Making an anarchy work properly is indeed, a bit of a struggle.)
* **Marriage and Type of Family Groupings:** The idea of marriage is irrelevant and not upheld. Most families are not true biological, and are instead small groupings of unrelated people. It is extremely rare for a new person to be born.
* **Child Training and Rites of Passage:** Physical age means nothing, therefore “children” and “adults” do not exist. In the extremely rare event a new person is born, the biological family are the ones to teach them most skills. In some dwellings, other people may help teach more advanced skills, such as fishing, farming, hunting, or construction. 
* **Religious Beliefs/Practices:** Most people have no belief in gods or spirits, however there are a few that believe in another “realm”. This belief is known as “Sithr”. A few that believe in the other realm will meditate every so often. Other than this, there are no other “practices” that are upheld.
* **Death Rituals:** There’s no certain way groups deal with the dead. If food is very scarce, the body may be used for consumption if there are no opposing persons. If there is a fairly close large body of water, the body may be placed on a vessel, and sent out (the vessel may or may not be set on fire). Bodies may be disposed of in a coffin and buried somewhere they frequented when alive. More often than not, bodies are either never found, or are decorated with nature and left to decompose in the open, away from main settlements.  
 

I've seen their symbol being that of a crimson hand print on a black background for a while. I'm more than okay with getting suggestions on that, however. I know some humans might not be able to relate to that symbol, and I don't mean to exclude them. 

I don't have any designated space for Frels to chat together at once. I honestly only made this Reddit to post this one message. If anyone has any ideas on a place I could have a little space set up, feel free to tell me, and I'll take a look. 

  
At the moment, I have absolutely no idea on if this idea will ever take off. But if a few people live near Roanoke, Virginia, I could see about meeting up in person or something. That's not a promise though. ~~Shit, I need friends anyways.~~

I think I've covered most things in this ass chunk of text. I'm probably not going to keep this account for long; I've somehow developed a distaste for social medias lately. If anyone truly feels like they would want to be part of this kind of community, feel free to message me.

Feel like I should end this with some kind of ""inspirational"" message, so here goes:

*If society isn't working for me, I'm not working for it.*",NonBinary,Wanna Join a Cult?,1575950122.0,"{'created_utc': 1575924922, 'id': 'e8fw4k', 'num_comments': 1, 'score': 1, 'selftext': '~~^((Or whatever, I don\'t know what to fuckin\' call it.))~~\n\nSo, basically, I\'ve had this idea in my head for some time now. Years, even. Only problem is that I haven\'t had the idea of where to begin with it. This is most likely going to be a giant text wall of random information, but if you want to have freedom, it might be worth the while to keep reading. \n\nI\'ll start with yakking about myself for a small bit: I\'ve had the displeasure of being alive for 20 years now. I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when I was 8 years old, and later with depression, anxiety, and selective mutism at 12 or so. (Although at this point in time, I think I have those plus PTSD, Autism, and Bipolar.) According to modern society, I\'ve been identified as an agender, asexual, aromantic for about 4 of those years. I prefer to keep things simple and non-discriminatory, only being known as ""human"". And this is where this ""cult"" aspect of things will come in. \n\nI\'m sure the greater part of people reading through this have an issue or 10 with the way society and governments are. I know I do. Having these useless documents with names and genders you can\'t associate yourself with. Not wanting to use a public restroom for the sake of degrading your own self. Idiots assuming and shouting false pronouns and/or names at you. Even assumptions about your age, race, sexual orientation, and whatever else someone can harass you with. \n\nSo, I started thinking. And, yes, originally all this was just an idea for some fictional tale I wanted to slave over writing one day. But I also started noticing more posts about people wanting to get away from it all. Wanting to run away from the abuse, the discrimination, the absolute bullshit the world has become. I begin to think, maybe, my idea wasn\'t as crazy as I thought it was.\n\nI\'ve never been able to perfect all the aspects of it, (not having any friends really puts a stop to things), so take some of this with a grain of salt. \n\nI wanted a loving, accepting community hidden away in a forest somewhere. Years ago, before all of this came up, I had envisioned an almost cyberpunk city in the middle of nowhere, full of solely LGBTQ+ people. I\'ve recently changed to more of an Old Nordic tribe feel. Seems a bit easier to manage, really. Certain traumatic events in the past 4 years of my life have let me to believe I should narrow the group down to being only humans who use neutral pronouns, and have no sexual preference, if any at all. Perhaps if I could really get this thing going, I might be willing to accept others again. But I\'m still not quite sure.\n\nI should probably just give a list of what I saw this community being. I\'m sure there\'s plenty of things missing, and most things could be changed. But as I said before, I haven\'t had anyone to help me with this.\n\nWithout further ado, here is what makes up the *Frel* society:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Values**: No living thing is above another. There is no discrimination against gender, sexual orientation, physical age, weight, race, etc. (To a certain extent, none of things exist anymore.) \n* **Ethics:** There is strong belief there is no true “good” or “evil”. (Within their own community. Someone who doesn\'t have the same values is immediately hated and wanted dead.)\n* **Division of Labor:** “Work” is not about earning a salary, and is instead about surviving. Jobs are not spread internationally, and are based on the settlements in which people live. These jobs can include, but aren’t limited to: farming, foraging/scavenging, hunting, and construction. People are allowed to have whatever work they choose, and are not forced to have or not have a job.\n* **Trade and Money:** In the case a group comes across another with the same views, bartering of goods may occur. This does not happen often however, and there is no set way of what will trade for what. Money is irrelevant.  \n* **Clothing and Adornment:** A balance of random modern clothing and natural items. Natural items include, but aren’t limited to: skulls, plants, seashells, and gems. Different types of bags are worn when foraging or scavenging. Makeup/face paints are common. \n* **Shelter and Dwellings:** Shelters can be fully made of the environments surroundings, a mix of natural and man-made, or in very rare cases, fully man-made. The buildings are often quite small, only large enough for about 3 or 4 people.  \n* **Government Structure:** Anarchy. There is no higher groups of people, there is no market or income, there isn’t much of anything. There is the rare, occasional trading of items between friendly groups, however it is not set in stone what trades for what or when a trade opportunity will arise.\n* **Law Enforcement:** There are no specific “laws” or “rules” written in stone anywhere to follow. If a person is suspected to be guilty of disrespecting the others of a settlement, they will be followed and observed for a while to expose the truth. If they are found to be guilty of this, they are held for further questioning. If the settlement comes to conclusion they should be gotten rid of, they are either permanently exiled or tormented and killed in a public show in brutal ways. If a settlement comes across a group that does not uphold their beliefs, they will kill without hesitation. (This is the largest questionable idea I have. Making an anarchy work properly is indeed, a bit of a struggle.)\n* **Marriage and Type of Family Groupings:** The idea of marriage is irrelevant and not upheld. Most families are not true biological, and are instead small groupings of unrelated people. It is extremely rare for a new person to be born.\n* **Child Training and Rites of Passage:** Physical age means nothing, therefore “children” and “adults” do not exist. In the extremely rare event a new person is born, the biological family are the ones to teach them most skills. In some dwellings, other people may help teach more advanced skills, such as fishing, farming, hunting, or construction. \n* **Religious Beliefs/Practices:** Most people have no belief in gods or spirits, however there are a few that believe in another “realm”. This belief is known as “Sithr”. A few that believe in the other realm will meditate every so often. Other than this, there are no other “practices” that are upheld.\n* **Death Rituals:** There’s no certain way groups deal with the dead. If food is very scarce, the body may be used for consumption if there are no opposing persons. If there is a fairly close large body of water, the body may be placed on a vessel, and sent out (the vessel may or may not be set on fire). Bodies may be disposed of in a coffin and buried somewhere they frequented when alive. More often than not, bodies are either never found, or are decorated with nature and left to decompose in the open, away from main settlements.  \n \n\nI\'ve seen their symbol being that of a crimson hand print on a black background for a while. I\'m more than okay with getting suggestions on that, however. I know some humans might not be able to relate to that symbol, and I don\'t mean to exclude them. \n\nI don\'t have any designated space for Frels to chat together at once. I honestly only made this Reddit to post this one message. If anyone has any ideas on a place I could have a little space set up, feel free to tell me, and I\'ll take a look. \n\n  \nAt the moment, I have absolutely no idea on if this idea will ever take off. But if a few people live near Roanoke, Virginia, I could see about meeting up in person or something. That\'s not a promise though. ~~Shit, I need friends anyways.~~\n\nI think I\'ve covered most things in this ass chunk of text. I\'m probably not going to keep this account for long; I\'ve somehow developed a distaste for social medias lately. If anyone truly feels like they would want to be part of this kind of community, feel free to message me.\n\nFeel like I should end this with some kind of ""inspirational"" message, so here goes:\n\n*If society isn\'t working for me, I\'m not working for it.*', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Wanna Join a Cult?', 'created': 1575950122.0}"

2019-12-09 21:13:42,e8g5m8,7,1,"Hello, first of all I want to apologise for any misspelling or autocorrected stuff, since I'm on mobile and English is not my first language. With that out of the way, let's proceed.
I'm 19 years old, born female and at the moment I identify as ""gender neutral"". I guess I never fited the ""girly"" type, as a child I was told repeatedly to""act like a lady"" and I always thought it was bullcrap and kept being just me, I always looked like a boy with long hair and was quite the tomboy growing up, not only in looks but in manners, all my girl friends when they fell and scratched a knee they would stop playing and start crying, me and many of the boys would just get up and start running again, for reasons like that I never really had a place among my peers, the girls were too girly for me, and the boys didn't want to play with a girl. I grew up practically alone, it was just me and my mom, I have an older brother, but at the time he was always working/studying/ sorting out his own life and didn't had time for his little sister, I don't blame him, I live with him now and, although we have ups and downs (like all siblings do) we love each other to bits.
When I was 12 I realized I was in love with a girl, and my mom being the only friend I had, I told her right away, I told her that I liked girls and boys, she had a little trouble accepting but was really supportive of me and I couldn't thank her enough for that, just a month before I turned 15 she passed away and I moved to live with my brother and his wife, they are a childless couple who at the time were newlyweds. I kinda feel like I ruined somethings for them. But I digress.
Through high school I realized I wasn't cis but didn't know what I was, FTM seemed wrong since although tomboyish I was quite feminine and always like makeup, and decided that ""gender fluid"" was the most descriptive of me at the time, but I kinda never really told anyone and just kept to myself. It was only early this year that I realized that could be wrong, every day I feel a need to present myself more and more masculine, at the beginning I styled my bangs to look like ""boy's hair"" and a month ago I shaved my sides, I feel pretty comfortable with the hair, but my body just doesn't belong, I feel very detached from it, I'm suffering with dysphoria, some days it's so strong that I disassociate ( I know I should seek therapy for that, but it's difficult when therapy gives you anxiety), lately I've been feeling the need to change my body, I want to get strong, have strong shoulders and back, have a smaller chest but it just seems so far away, atm I can't afford a gym membership and I honestly don't know if I'll feel comfortable going to the gym, I hate being the center of attention and I feel like I'd be. Also a chest reduction surgery is expensive and as a broke, unemployed millennial I can't afford it, even if I saved, I was talking to a lgbtq friend who's enby and they told me I might be trans, and I just should look into gender identities and choose what is right for me, I'm not going to lie, I wondered if I was trans many times, but for some reason it scares me. I feel scared to be trans, and I'm having a hard time accepting myself, I know my family and friends will accept me anyway I am, but I just can't grasp my Head around being trans, it just sents me into a deep anxiety, panick-y mode that feels horrible.
I don't know what I want from this, I guess I just needed to vent because I'm too afraid to talk about it with family and friends, it just feels more real if I talk about, and this felt like the right place to vent.

Lately I've been shaving my entire face whenever I had the chance. In the past couple weeks, I've come to the realization. I don't hate my facial hair, just the mustache. So I've started just shaving my mustache and leaving the sideburns and whatnot. The beard is growing extremely slowly, so maybe I'll decide to shave that when it fully grows in, but we'll see.

Clothing. I bought two skirts at a thrift store, going based on my stepmother's size. They fit mostly perfectly, and I enjoy wearing them.

I've told a few close friends that I'm questioning, leaning towards non-binary.

I've always had a lot of self doubt and have been a very insular person who tends to obsess over thoughts and ideas, and spin them out into long, overly convoluted narratives in my mind. Despite knowing it's not healthy for me in the slightest I've ended up doing just that with my gender, and I've reached a point where I've confused myself so much I don't know if I can trust my own feelings.

What tends to happen is I go over the thoughts again and again in my mind, until I've confused myself as to what feeling like a man or feeling like a woman is supposed to feel like, and ideas about what I do feel like get all jumbled up and I don't know which is which. When I think about it logically I know I am non-binary, because whenever I let my mind drift and I ask myself the same question after a while, that's always the answer I come up with, but it's very hard for me to remember that when my mind is throwing my ideas of what gender is in a blender. I also find it hard to separate my idea of gender from my sex, even though I get euphoria whenever I think of myself being more feminine, and I have difficulty working out how to feel male and female at the same time; it kinda feels like both halves are at war with one another, and I can only experience them one at a time.

There are times that I see or read stuff that really affirms my feelings of being bigender and I get a rush of euphoria, and I've been through this whole process of self doubt (in a way it's still ongoing) with my sexuality, so I know that the only way to really figure these things out for me is by relying on my instinctual feelings.

For the past month I’ve been lurking on the /r/nonbinary sub and reviewing all of you beautiful individual’s posts and photos. 

I have accepted that I am trans for the better part of this year. While in a small support group I was expressing great anxiety over the thought that I may need to transition. One of the other participants asked if I considered that I might be non-binary. For some reason that seemed to help at the time.

Since then I’ve struggled with the thought that I could be NB. I try to understand what it is to be NB. My ignorant take on what it means, seems to be the need to express one’s gender that doesn’t have to be with in the gender norms or can float between or be neither. I read of embies that transition which confuses my limited understanding even further.

There is definitely a part of me that has imagined being a female my entire life however I repressed these feelings for 4 decades and have begun processing these feelings for the past 2-1/2 years.

I myself have been struggling so hard with my identity. I’ve been trying to grasp at identifying as NB as I wish to hold onto my marriage. My wife says she can’t be with a woman. For me however, I don’t feel that my inner turmoil is about expression. It feels more core than that. Who knows, I may just be kidding myself...I am so lost as to what my needs are but have felt that if I were NB, that perhaps that would be enough for me and a compromise that my wife could accept.

Sadly however, after lurking on this sub for a month, I honestly haven’t been able relate as much as say to posts on more binary targeted trans subs.

I’ve spoken to my gender therapist about contemplating if I could be NB but haven’t gotten anywhere. I feel so stupid that I have such a mental block. I hope that someone can shed some light so that I can understand better. 

TLTR;
Been questioning my identity for nearly 3 years and need to better understand of what it is to be NB vs binary transgender.


Can some of you explain what it means for you to be NB vs binary? 

Did any of you start by thinking you were binary then realized afterwards you are NB?

Is medically transitioning atypically for NB individuals?

2019-12-11 21:48:07,e9dsft,1,1," Hi!

I'm Gabi.  


First of all, thanks for reading and sorry for my english, which is not good enough.  


And sorry if I'm in the wrong place.  


I'm a 33 yo boy who wants to achieve a partial feminization of my body.  


Small breasts, thicker thighs and a rounder ass, is basically what I want.  


Body and facial hair is not a major problem.  


I want to keep my libido, if possible, but I don't have worries about my erections.  


For this, I want to try bicalutamide 50mg + estradiol 2mg, daily, with blood monitoring.  


I can change the dosages during the therapy and we have plenty of information about drugs and dosages in reddit.  


We really have plenty information about mtf therapy for transgenders, I know.  


The target ranges of hormone levels for transgenders, if I'm not wrong, is about estradiol 100-200pg/ml and about testosterone 50pg/ml.  


**My question, if you all can help me, is:**  


**What's the target ranges of hormone levels for a non-binary, like me?**  


We have info about non-binary therapy, but it's hard to find info about levels of hormones.  


**Is estradiol 50-100pg/ml and testosterone 200pg/ml a plausible target?**  


If not, what levels should I target?  
Thank you very much!

2019-12-11 22:01:13,e9dz9g,3,1,"So a little Background Info: I am not out and I am not sure if or when it's going to happen. I am a bi/panromantic non-binary (they/them.) I am born female and quite curvy, so even with a binder I'm not completely flat. I would say I usually present quite androgynous, but as my body is more female I tend to present more masculine. My style is quite lazy, usually jeans with a T-shirt and an (oversized) hoodie.

During the holiday season I always feel stressed out about dressing up, because first of all I don't like wearing something formal. Next to that wearing dresses isn't really my favourite, but I usually end up wearing them at least once every year. Last fall we had a ball and I wore a long (prom) dress including pumps and make-up. After that I decided it was the last time this year I wore a dress and felt uncomfortable in my own clothes. (I basically drunk myself through that night.)

So now the Christmas party with our rugbyteam is coming. They luckily don't expect anyone to wear a dress, because we have group costumes (jumper.) But now (with just one week to go) our finesmasters decided that everyone should also wear pumps and lipstick. Maybe if I was out or more female presenting I wouldn't feel uncomfortable at all, but I am seriously thinking about not going or ignoring the rule here. I don't want to wear pumps and Lipstick, but being the only one not doing it will get akward. I try to see it as something fun we all do (in that sense gender neutral,) but that doesn't work for me.  It also seems a really weird occasion for me to come out to my team (we are a women's team which makes things slightly more complex.) I would just like to focus on having fun together, but just thinking about it now gets me really anxious.
Is there anything else I could do? What would you do?

2019-12-11 22:02:17,e9dzuo,3,1,"This post contains talk of my body with sexual content, so if that would make anyone uncomfortable then please scroll past! Have a good day! ❤

I've been questioning my identity a lot recently, and I've remembered something that's really confused me for years now and I didn't know what it was or could be. I was wondering if I can run it past you all.

So, for context, I have the primary and secondary sexual characteristics of the average female. That tends to bother me from time to time but that could be for a myriad of reasons. I have occasional problems with my weight and food and such, and I assumed my problems with my body were due to me being unhappy about my weight, and because of disordered thoughts. I'm sure that's still part of it, but I'm starting to realize that's not the whole story. I'm normally unhappy with having breasts and assumed it was because I preferred the flat-chested look of being underweight. I also have had a problem with my period and thought I didn't like having one because it meant I was too ""healthy"" and not underweight enough. These things can largely be explained away as something disordered without a second thought. But lately, as I've begun questioning my identity, I've considered that I also don't like those things because I am uncomfortable with those aspects of femininity and don't really identify with having breasts or a period. However, considering the cross over with disordered thoughts, I've been unable to reach a conclusion. But I recently remembered something else. 

When I try to masturbate by putting something in my vagina I almost always end up crying because it feels very wrong. I used to think maybe I felt some sort of internalized shame for the behavior. But after many porn videos and attempts get used to it later, I felt the same. The problem doesn't seem to be with my thoughts on sex or being sexual, because I'm normally a very open-minded person about sexuality, to myself and others. Plus, I can masturbate in different ways and feel fine, with no shame what so ever. 

I then considered that maybe I had some sort of repressed traumatic experience that made me feel that way. I guess if it were truly repressed then there's still a chance for that one, but I really don't feel like that's the case. When I try to masturbate and I feel that what I'm doing is wrong, nothing ever comes to mind. No glimpse of any memory or anything that would ever make me question if I had been hurt in the past or not. I truly feel like there is no trauma. 

So, I'm starting to think that my experiences might mean that I'm just not comfortable with being a female, from a biological perspective. I also have no interest or affinity with being a male either.

I've been questioning my gender lately. I am afab(22 years old) and have mostly been content with identifying as female.

I feel sad and miserable when I think that people look at me and see a girl. I'm mostly comfortable with my body and I like wearing make up, but I wish that I'd look more masculine.

I feel like I don't want to be a girl but I don't feel like I'm a trans dude either. I'd be happiest to be seen as a very pretty dude or androgynous, so that people can't tell what gender I am.
All labels feel like too much. I usually take the ""other"" option if it's available because it is what feels the most right. Still, words like 'non-binary' to describe me feels too much.

I had my initial appointment to be prescribed female hormones (I’m an AMAB enby). The appointment was smooth as could be: the doctor checked my medical history, went over everything, explained the risks and benefits, and even offered me two options (sublingual tablets or transdermal patches). I chose the tablets. I have a three-month follow up in March, but until then I’m good to go. Even had my prescription sent to my local pharmacy.

I was lucky, and I know it.

It isn’t for everybody and it isn’t in everyone’s best interest, but for some of us it saves a lot of needless waiting and pain.

Today also marked the first day I attempted to present as feminine in public. Wore a cute baby-blue blouse, black leggings and skirt, and black suede booties. I swear the only comment I got was from a gay guy telling me to “work it!”

2019-12-12 14:30:28,e9o9oe,9,1,"I have a little question for everyone here. There's a lot of posts in this sub about how people are presenting on a given day. I take this to mean that many non-binary people might go out of their way to appear closer to one gender than another as a way of navigating the spectrum. 

I've considered myself non-binary for a little less than a year now, though I haven't come out yet to all my freinds and family. I'm also bi, but I don't really think that's relevant. 

So I'm a big person with a beard and I present extremely masculine. I do small things like paint my nails or wear eyeliner. Occasionally in the summer I will wear extremely tight/short cut off jeans, but that's about it. In general, I appear very manly.

When I began feeling that I was non-binary, it wasn't because I had any desire to be seen as a different gender than my given one or anything like that, it had more to do with not really identifying with the other traditional gender roles associated with masculinity and not being limited by them in anyway. 

So idk.. am I NB or am I something else? I'm a little confused here. I've been closeted  bi for a few years and have little to no engagement with the queer community. I really don't know who else to ask about this. I don't want to be confined by the gender I was assigned at birth, but I don't really know anymore if that alone makes me NB or if it requires some change in my outward appearance away from what is typically considered masculine. A lot of posts on this sub specifically have made me wonder about this. 

This last bit is a little off-topic, but I wonder about it too. 

I prefer they/them but I don't really mind when people call me dude or man? Idk if this is typical or not, but I have always used those words when talking to my non-male freinds for my whole life, so I guess it just doesn't carry the same gendered weight for me.

Hi, so I don’t know if this is the right place to ask this or not but I didn't know where to go so I thought I'd try you guys. I don't really know how to word this, I am very nervous and I just don’t know how to articulate my feelings about my gender at all.

I am assigned female at birth and I don’t mind if people call me she/her, I don’t mind what pronouns people use to refer to me, I am happy with all of them. However, I can’t seem to identify with a label or pronoun. I don’t feel connected to any of them, despite the fact that I love people ‘misgendering’ me and calling me he/him, but I know I am not a man. I want to present androgynous, slightly more on the masculine side of that scale, and I bind my chest (not that, that’s an indicator of gender). I don’t want surgeries or hormones as I am happy with my body in that sense but I don’t feel connected to its gender, or any gender/label. I just feel like a thing inhabiting a body. I don’t know if that feeling is a mental illness thing where I feel disconnected from my body (I do have a lot of issues with mental health/illnesses).

I thought all this might mean I prefer they/them but again the feeling of disconnection applies. I don’t care if people call me they/them but I don’t know if I identify with those pronouns. I feel almost genderless but unable to connect with any labels or pronouns. Could I just be a cis person wanting to present androgynous? Am I just overthinking things? Am I non-binary or agender? I don’t know, am looking for some guidance and help here. I know labels are what you feel but I don’t know what I feel and just need some help thinking about this. I know some people think you don't need labels and I tried that, tried to just accept that I don't have labels or preferred pronouns or whatever but that didn't work. The dysphoria and weird anxious feelings kept coming up.

Sorry this is so long. Thank you if you managed to get this far, hopefully I’ve used correct terminology and everything. If not I apologise.

My dysphoria has been getting a little out of hand. I've been having a troubling time with my chest and hips, mainly my chest. Well, good news! I'LL BE GETTING A CHEST BINDER IN JANUARY OF 2020!

I'm so happy. I can't believe I'm finally going to be getting a binder. After all these years of pain and dysphoria and more pain and even worse dysphoria and suffering, I'm going to be getting exactly what I wanted. In April of 2020, I'll be getting my new spring wardrobe. I'll be picking out my clothes and will be able to go for the look I want. It's going to be more androgynous but with a touch of femme. Now, with a binder, it'll be even more awesome! My chest will be flat, my style will be what I always wanted it to be, and I'll finally be me. I'm planning to come out by the following summer as non-binary to a transphobic family, too. 2020 is going to be a very eventful year.

2019-12-15 17:41:58,eb1wso,0,1,"CW: Misgendering people

I'm very conflicted about misgendering others... I deeply apologize if this offends anyone, I'm still very new to the GSRM community so please be gentle with me and help me understand things better so I can be a good member/ally (whichever the heck I am). You guys were so supportive of me when I realized I might not be non-binary because of my DPDR diagnosis, I would never purposely betray that sentiment, hearing all the nice comments meant too much to me. ❤

That said, I recently had an argument with someone on Reddit who didn't want the OP of a sub/r post ([regarding a really cute video](https://youtu.be/zdBCOXYQQEE)) to assume the parent's gender, as it said they were a great father. This is my thoughts on this: 

The majority of the world is still cis and that's just the way it is (for now, at least). It's true that we don't know if he is truly the little girl's father or brother or cousin or uncle or whatever. That's not important. It's the heart that is important. 

I have heard that folks within the GSRM community want to eliminate gendering people altogether as to be sensitive to one's gender identity but I personally feel this is... excessive. If we are too wary about not misgendering others, we aren't accounting binary folk at all, especially cis folk. I don't think we don't need to stop gendering EVERYONE simply because gender identity has changed over the years.
 
Purposeful misgendering is rude (screw the people who disregard other's gender identities, they suck big time) but accidental misgendering is inevitable. You can use they pronouns all you like but if the alleged father identifies as the male, you've still misgendered him. Let me use myself and others who identify similarly as another example: A Demigirl's pronouns might be shey/sheir/shem and they don't like she/her or they/their/them pronouns; using either or instead of the one is misgendering that person (obviously this doesn't apply to all Demigirls so some might be okay with these pronouns).

Besides, it takes - what? - three seconds to make assumptions and judgments on a person we first meet or are introduced to? We're gonna think one way or another about a person anyway - and gender is included in that - so it seems irrelevant of how mindful of gender we are. 

Trying to eliminate gender with everyone is like saying animals shouldn't be gendered, when they clearly do (not all animals do, of course, as some are non-binary); I deeply apologize for anyone who thinks this but I feel this, too, is extremely excessive. Animals have fixed genders depending on their biology and do not have the same level of sentience humans do to form gender identities (not that they aren't sentient at all but identity is unique to humans in my opinion; animals are wild and untamed creatures who abide by their own rules).

You know, the person I was bickering with who said they didn't know if the alleged father is actually male but they assumed the toddler's gender... 🤔 They also assumed I was transphobic when I'm fairly certain I am not; being that I am still teetering on whether I'm still non-binary or not (never heard of a transphobic non-binary person, let alone a transphobic transperson). Furthermore, I feel that restricting pronouns towards everyone would make the world feel hollow, lifeless, and devoid of color; the color that is both binary AND non-binary folks.

Also, were it not for the fact that I had DPDR-related dysphoria, I would've tried to move past the awkwardness and used shey/sheir/shem pronouns because I identified as a Demigirl. It could've been an inaccurate pronoun for me unless I accepted she and they separately (or all three), and I was contemplating on omitting them both and just using the other. And with how confused I was, it didn't matter what pronouns I chose, I would've felt misgendered either way because of my inner turmoil and depersonalization. Which proves my point: misgendering is inevitable, even for oneself; especially so. 

We won't ever get verifiable information on the alleged father's gender identity (or anyone else's for that matter) so it really doesn't matter. People make assumptions all the time. The person I was arguing with said ""transphobia at his best"" to my reply, assuming I was male when I'm not (Unless you meant to type ""its best"" then nevermind); misgendering me.

Regardless, saying we shouldn't try to accommodate for gender identity 100% of the time is not transphobic, it's just logical because it's impossible to do so and not offend SOMEONE. You have and will misgendered others and the same shall be done to you. There's no way to change it unless you are psychic or if the person in question corrects you directly.

These are my thoughts and, again, I deeply apologize for offending anyone. I'm still at a very confusing stage in my life right now. I'm constantly trying to understand who I am because my DPDR has robbed me of my identity. I hope I came off as respectful as possible because when I watch videos like this [one](https://youtu.be/BYuSHi-9fhc)
 and cry so hard, I sincerely mean no ill-intent to GSRM folk. I said [something on YouTube](https://imgur.com/gallery/x2LCoaK)

Sorry for the ramble, just wanted to be transparent with y'all.",NonBinary,I'm very conflicted about misgendering others...,1576456918.0,"{'created_utc': 1576431718, 'id': 'eb1wso', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'CW: Misgendering people\n\nI\'m very conflicted about misgendering others... I deeply apologize if this offends anyone, I\'m still very new to the GSRM community so please be gentle with me and help me understand things better so I can be a good member/ally (whichever the heck I am). You guys were so supportive of me when I realized I might not be non-binary because of my DPDR diagnosis, I would never purposely betray that sentiment, hearing all the nice comments meant too much to me. ❤\n\nThat said, I recently had an argument with someone on Reddit who didn\'t want the OP of a sub/r post ([regarding a really cute video](https://youtu.be/zdBCOXYQQEE)) to assume the parent\'s gender, as it said they were a great father. This is my thoughts on this: \n\nThe majority of the world is still cis and that\'s just the way it is (for now, at least). It\'s true that we don\'t know if he is truly the little girl\'s father or brother or cousin or uncle or whatever. That\'s not important. It\'s the heart that is important. \n\nI have heard that folks within the GSRM community want to eliminate gendering people altogether as to be sensitive to one\'s gender identity but I personally feel this is... excessive. If we are too wary about not misgendering others, we aren\'t accounting binary folk at all, especially cis folk. I don\'t think we don\'t need to stop gendering EVERYONE simply because gender identity has changed over the years.\n \nPurposeful misgendering is rude (screw the people who disregard other\'s gender identities, they suck big time) but accidental misgendering is inevitable. You can use they pronouns all you like but if the alleged father identifies as the male, you\'ve still misgendered him. Let me use myself and others who identify similarly as another example: A Demigirl\'s pronouns might be shey/sheir/shem and they don\'t like she/her or they/their/them pronouns; using either or instead of the one is misgendering that person (obviously this doesn\'t apply to all Demigirls so some might be okay with these pronouns).\n\nBesides, it takes - what? - three seconds to make assumptions and judgments on a person we first meet or are introduced to? We\'re gonna think one way or another about a person anyway - and gender is included in that - so it seems irrelevant of how mindful of gender we are. \n\nTrying to eliminate gender with everyone is like saying animals shouldn\'t be gendered, when they clearly do (not all animals do, of course, as some are non-binary); I deeply apologize for anyone who thinks this but I feel this, too, is extremely excessive. Animals have fixed genders depending on their biology and do not have the same level of sentience humans do to form gender identities (not that they aren\'t sentient at all but identity is unique to humans in my opinion; animals are wild and untamed creatures who abide by their own rules).\n\nYou know, the person I was bickering with who said they didn\'t know if the alleged father is actually male but they assumed the toddler\'s gender... 🤔 They also assumed I was transphobic when I\'m fairly certain I am not; being that I am still teetering on whether I\'m still non-binary or not (never heard of a transphobic non-binary person, let alone a transphobic transperson). Furthermore, I feel that restricting pronouns towards everyone would make the world feel hollow, lifeless, and devoid of color; the color that is both binary AND non-binary folks.\n\nAlso, were it not for the fact that I had DPDR-related dysphoria, I would\'ve tried to move past the awkwardness and used shey/sheir/shem pronouns because I identified as a Demigirl. It could\'ve been an inaccurate pronoun for me unless I accepted she and they separately (or all three), and I was contemplating on omitting them both and just using the other. And with how confused I was, it didn\'t matter what pronouns I chose, I would\'ve felt misgendered either way because of my inner turmoil and depersonalization. Which proves my point: misgendering is inevitable, even for oneself; especially so. \n\nWe won\'t ever get verifiable information on the alleged father\'s gender identity (or anyone else\'s for that matter) so it really doesn\'t matter. People make assumptions all the time. The person I was arguing with said ""transphobia at his best"" to my reply, assuming I was male when I\'m not (Unless you meant to type ""its best"" then nevermind); misgendering me.\n\nRegardless, saying we shouldn\'t try to accommodate for gender identity 100% of the time is not transphobic, it\'s just logical because it\'s impossible to do so and not offend SOMEONE. You have and will misgendered others and the same shall be done to you. There\'s no way to change it unless you are psychic or if the person in question corrects you directly.\n\nThese are my thoughts and, again, I deeply apologize for offending anyone. I\'m still at a very confusing stage in my life right now. I\'m constantly trying to understand who I am because my DPDR has robbed me of my identity. I hope I came off as respectful as possible because when I watch videos like this [one](https://youtu.be/BYuSHi-9fhc)\n and cry so hard, I sincerely mean no ill-intent to GSRM folk. I said [something on YouTube](https://imgur.com/gallery/x2LCoaK)\na few months ago and I meant every word - and it doesn\'t even just apply to sexuality, it also applies to gender and romantic identities, too.

2019-12-17 16:35:00,eby3o4,13,1,"(i don't know hos to do this but TW for internalized transphobia?)

so i've known i was nonbinary for maybe six years, but for most of that time i made myself hide it because i felt a lot of shame about it. recently i have begun to try accepting it since it started becoming too painful to hide. i told my girlfriend and one of my friends who is trans. my girlfriend desn't really seem to understand. she basically says like ""why can't you just learn to accept yourself"" and stuff. i guess i understand she's worried but i don't know how to tell her that this *is* part of accepting myself. i'm planning on getting top surgery and she is really worried about it but i don't know how to explain to her that i would rather tear my flesh off myself than be stuck with these useless lumps of flesh on my chest that stop me from doing what i want.

i have a lot of dysphoria, especially socially, and it seems like everyone i know makes a point of gendering me as male. i hate it and it feels like i am constantly pretending to be someone i'm not. but i know it would be just as painful to be seen as a girl all the time so i don't know what to do. i feel like i am trapped between a rock and a hard place. everyone seems to constantly push gendered expectations on me and i am tired of it but i am so used to hiding my feelings that i don't know how i would begin unraveling this mess. i want to pick a new name but it seems really difficult to pick a unisex name because they all seem to lean to one side gender-wise. (i think the name i might pick is Micah Sage, but i know micah is used more often for guys and it bothers me. is dylan more unisex than micah? because i was thinking about that too. i can't tell someone let me know pls)

a long time ago i changed my presentation and name to a more masculine one and people pretty much assumed i was a dude because it's less complicated, and i just went with it because it was different from being gendered as female. and it felt good because it was different, and i kinda believed it for a long time. but now i'm realizing that it's just as uncomfortable to be pushed into the male box as it is to be pushed into the female one.

so like i have some questions as a baby enby:

1. how do you all deal with society forcing you into boxes you don't belong in? it causes me a lot of distress but i don't know how i can stop it or ignore it. i want people to see who i actually am because i'm tired of pretending, but no one where i live even knows what a nonbinary person is. and i feel too shy to explain it. most people where i live speak french and it doesn't even seem possible to have unisex pronouns in french. heck every single noun is gramatically male or female in french.

2. how do you ask people to use another name and pronouns? (i think i would like either they/them or a mix of he and she pronouns.) i feel like asking people is a huge burden and is also embarassing. i think i have some internalized transphobia because i have no problem changing what pronouns i use for other people, but i always misgender myself inside my head. i feel like if i ask people that kind of thing they won't understand. i'm really introverted and i don't like asking people to do stuff for me. my girlfriend is trying to use my new name and pronouns but i'm not out to anyone else so she doesn't usually get the opportunity, and also english isn't her first language so she has difficulty using they/them

3. are there any unisex informal terms to use for yourself? like how people say dude or girl, is there a nonbinary word for that? i know there's enby but i would like to learn more of them

4. how do i stop feeling like a massive black hole of disgusting shame? literally i feel like a caricature of an sjw and i feel like everyone would make fun of me if i came out. i have a lot of anxiety so maybe it's just that. my feeling about my gender seems to be really easily affected by what i see. like if i watch a cartoon where they make transphobic jokes, i feel like i am shrinking, and i feel like maybe i'm not nonbinary after all? maybe i just want to feel like a special snowflake attack helicopter? and i feel really ashamed. but like the other day i saw a poster of a person outside who had a nonbinary flag on their shirt, and even though it was a really small thing that 99% of people wouldn't notice, it made me feel a lot more confident in the moment. like, maybe it's okay to be like this, and i'm not the only one? idk. anyway how do i get more confidence in a world that seems to constantly be pushing nonbinary people down???",NonBinary,i don't know how y'all do this and i need some help,1576625700.0,"{'created_utc': 1576600500, 'id': 'eby3o4', 'num_comments': 13, 'score': 1, 'selftext': '(i don\'t know hos to do this but TW for internalized transphobia?)\n\nso i\'ve known i was nonbinary for maybe six years, but for most of that time i made myself hide it because i felt a lot of shame about it. recently i have begun to try accepting it since it started becoming too painful to hide. i told my girlfriend and one of my friends who is trans. my girlfriend desn\'t really seem to understand. she basically says like ""why can\'t you just learn to accept yourself"" and stuff. i guess i understand she\'s worried but i don\'t know how to tell her that this *is* part of accepting myself. i\'m planning on getting top surgery and she is really worried about it but i don\'t know how to explain to her that i would rather tear my flesh off myself than be stuck with these useless lumps of flesh on my chest that stop me from doing what i want.\n\ni have a lot of dysphoria, especially socially, and it seems like everyone i know makes a point of gendering me as male. i hate it and it feels like i am constantly pretending to be someone i\'m not. but i know it would be just as painful to be seen as a girl all the time so i don\'t know what to do. i feel like i am trapped between a rock and a hard place. everyone seems to constantly push gendered expectations on me and i am tired of it but i am so used to hiding my feelings that i don\'t know how i would begin unraveling this mess. i want to pick a new name but it seems really difficult to pick a unisex name because they all seem to lean to one side gender-wise.

2019-12-18 03:15:33,ec6umg,13,1,"I've been reading the book *Nonbinary: Memoirs of Gender and Identity*. It's a great book and I highly recommend it. In the chapter titled ""My Genderqueer Backpack"" the author, Melissa L. Welter, discusses the idea of us caring around a genderqueer backpack full of all of the bits and pieces of gender we have and carry around with us. In the backpack the author describes things left over from being raised and socialized as one gender, the parts they have from others, and things they've picked up from being genderqueer.  Here's a section to give you the idea:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I experimented, picking up some gender behaviors and discarding others. As I unpacked what made up gender for me, it allowed me to repack exactly what I want to include moving forward. Much of what I’ve packed is from (and for) being a woman. I spent the most time identifying as a woman, so this section is full. Next, there are a few select pieces from manhood, things I’ve shopped for rather carefully. Sometimes, I still miss the mark. Finally, there are some specialty pieces I’ve obtained from being genderqueer. Here’s a look at what I carry in my very own Genderqueer Backpack.

&gt;**STUFF LEFT OVER FROM BEING RAISED AND SOCIALIZED AS A GIRL/WOMAN**   
&gt;  
&gt;*A permeable space bubble*. My openness allows me to use affectionate touch to communicate support, comfort, and happiness. It lets me do things like hug and cuddle friends and small children without feeling like I’m overstepping. When I came out as genderqueer, a friend looked thoughtfully from me to her three-year-old son, who was playing nearby. “Do you still want him to call you Auntie, or something else?” I can still drop my hand to casually ruffle his hair, patch up a scraped knee, and receive a shy hug before he goes to bed. The place where their acceptance meets my gendered space is precious to me. I’m definitely keeping it.

I think it's a great way to describe what it feels like for some of us. After reading that chapter I've been trying to list what's in my backpack. It's been a really fun and validating experience.

I’m looking to reach out !! 
I was bullied in my home province.
I have a false order against me .
However I am not stepping down.
I’ve already been to court and am looking to make an impact and stand up.

I, support the directly affected individuals of LGBTQ+ discrimination and bullying in all communities. 
I, support the idea that, our communities are in need of stronger LGBTQ+ representative’s, resources, and outlets for LGBTQ+ identifying individuals. 
Especially for our diverse communities involving the LGBTQ+ sector. 
I, acknowledge discrimination and harassment in communities towards LGBTQ+ individuals. 
I, support Anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination, bullying, and abuse and want it to end.

I, support the idea of more resources; so that LGBTQ+ identifying individuals, can obtain such resources. 
Without being exposed to bias judgment and subject to humiliation, by figures who hold power in communities. 
I, oppose the abusive, and harassing actions shown in our communities towards LGBTQ+ and I stand for change!

My mission: To be a stronger representative for our LGBTQ+ communities. 
To be able to collaborate with community leaders and work towards solutions for the demand for support and outlets in communities. 
I will provide a voice against LGBTQ+ discrimination. 
I will be able to provide a solution; without identifying individuals being exposed to bias judgmental opinions by figures who hold power in communities.
We are one community. We stand together.
❤️🧡💛💚💙💜

i've identified as nonbinary for the past 6 years but it's taken a long time to feel even remotely confident in my identity.  but denying myself over and over and being complacent is wearing me down (what a shock, lol). this year has been the biggest step in my transition - changing my legal name and having a consultation for top surgery (i'm afab). i'm out and accepted in my social circles so there's no issues there.

as the title suggests, the next step i want to do is come out to my mum. she still uses my deadname (not her fault, i haven't asked her to use my new name...) and uses a lot of gendered language that makes me dysphoric. i want to come out to her bc i feel like i have to hide so much of myself. i still feel so insecure about my identity, so i would like any tips, resources and just general encouragement. have you come out to your parents? how did you tell them? how did they react? 

i know my mum won't like, disown me or anything. she is very supportive of LGBT people (i'm already out as pan to her and she supports me being in relationships w women) and she has talked about her support for trans people... but i think she will have a hard time grasping what nonbinary is.

I (AFAB, non-binary, not interested in testosterone for various reasons) mentioned to my therapist that I think I would benefit a lot from vocal training. I went to my first vocal therapist session this Wednesday and y'all it was super challenging.

The problem is that I really don't want to be on T, but I get a lot of dysphoria from being identified as ""a woman"" on the phone or by strangers. I have... a fairly high voice. Average of my vocal range is 220 hz and even with trying I could not force my voice to go below 180 hz without glottal fry, which is harmful for your voice and makes it just kind of sound like mumbling. The high end of average male voices is about 165 hz or an E3. 

This is super frustrating and after being told about this I know have WAY WAY MORE dysphoria about my voice knowing that it will be fairly hard for my voice to go lower without Testosterone.

When I was in elementary school I spent a lot of time in my room exploring my body, looking at it from all different angles, wondering why it was the way it was, and why I had to be a girl. In my early teens, I used to sit in my room, barricade the door, and put on oversized boy's clothes that I'd gotten from one of my brothers, bound my chest down with ace bandages (not for an extended period of time, usually only an hour at a time at most), and tucked my hair under my hat. And I'd just sit dressed like that in my bedroom. 

I grew to embrace my first name so much because it's an old Latin name that's gender neutral/masculine leaning. 

But when I was younger, I never knew what trans was. I didn't know what a gender identity was, or what non-binary was, or that any of it was even an option. I acted in private on those desires without knowing anything about the lgbtq+ community. I ended up hardcore repressing it until earlier this year. As of now I have been with my wife for 2 years, she is an mtf trans woman. Since her and I started dating, I dove headfirst into the community in an effort to learn more about her and how I could help her in her transition. And I ended up learning a whole lot about myself. 

I thought I was straight. I'm not. I thought I was just a regular cis woman. I'm not. I'm a pansexual, non-binary person. That's who I am. 

It still feels weird. Like really weird. But I told my wife. I told her that she can still call me her wifey, because honestly I like hearing that title from her, it makes my heart flutter and brings me a smile every time. My daughter, who I've adopted through being with my boyfriend, is still allowed to call me momma, because again, I like the title, and honestly I don't even know what else she'd call me because I haven't heard any other parental-type titles that I've liked and my name is hard for her to say. My wife is so incredibly supportive, and honestly I wouldn't be here without her. 

My younger brother was hesitant at first, and tbh his initial responses hurt. But after about an hour I got a supportive message back. And he knows I have a soft spot for Lilo and Stitch, and he pulled the ""Ohana"" thing on me and it was really cute but also I cried. 

I'm just so glad I can start to really be myself. I guess 24 isn't such a bad time to start. Now I guess I can start stocking up on different clothes and binders and stuff.

2019-12-20 15:37:52,edbq31,1,1,"Hi! New poster, heavily questioning my gender and whether I'm cis or NB. I've read a lot of 'how do you know'-type help websites and I still don't feel any closer to an answer. I'm AFAB, and it's really hard to know whether I just think I might be non-binary because of abc factors (elaborated on below) or whether I just think I might be a woman because of xyz factors (also elaborated on below). I guess I'm just not sure what it means to feel non-binary or like a woman in such a way that would actually make me either of those things. I think it'd be really helpful to hear about experiences from non-binary (or questioning!) people who've experienced similar issues. Thank you in advance to anybody who takes the time to read and/or respond to this! 

Content warning for mentions of eating disordered behaviour + body image issues, and non-in-depth talk about sexual assault.

As for the factors which I think might be causing me to 'feel' nb: I'm autistic and bisexual. I think both of these things could have caused me to just not fully relate to many of the other men and women I've encountered while growing up, so it feels like there's some fundamental difference in how we experience the world (with respect to the autism) and with how we perceive people across the gender spectrum (with respect to my sexuality). 

In addition to that, I've suffered with body image issues and eating disordered behaviour for most of my life now. I feel extremely uncomfortable with the parts of my body that are typically considered feminine (e.g. wide hips, etc) but it's difficult to know whether that body dysphoria is gendered or a result of a general fear of fatness and weight gain (on myself). I know that I'd like to present more androgynously a lot of the time, but I frequently find myself thinking that I'm too fat to look good as an androgynous person and that given the distribution of my weight, I can only look good presenting femininely (I definitely don't think this about other people, just myself). Similarly, I feel mentally weird about my genitals and about being sexualised as a woman (even by partners I love/trust/am physically attracted to), but it's difficult to know whether that's gendered or whether that's a result of having been sexually assaulted + eating disordered stuff. 

As for the factors which I think might be causing me to feel like a woman: being treated as a woman and facing the same social issues as other women, basically; when women say 'it feels like x to be treated like y' when talking about issues they've faced as women, I identify with those feelings because I've frequently been in the same situations. 

&amp;#x200B;

Reading this word vomit and thinking that I'm probably just overthinking the whole thing, and maybe there's just no good way to separate out these issues.

Here's the thing: I realized I'm transfemme earlier this year, and have gone through two rounds of laser hair removal for my face. I currently have an HRT appointment at Planned Parenthood in January. I'm feeling a bit... weird about all of this. When I don't have facial hair, I love my smooth face. As it's growing in, I hate it. But when it's here... I don't mind it? And I can't tell if that's because I truly don't mind it or because of internalized transphobia saying, ""you look like a man! Embrace it!""

The way I view my identity, I see myself as a non-binary human who currently presents masculinely as the default, and occasionally presents femininely; I want the reverse to be true. I want to be able to wear a face full of make up with no facial hair on the daily, and occasionally present masculinely. I have a difficult time with transitional periods, so my transness is like a big ol' slap to the face sometimes.

I'm wondering, does anyone else out there feel the way I do? Like, I'm excited to present femininely as the default, but I also feel like I \*could\* just stay the way I am, even though I think I'd be happier if I complete laser hair removal and go on hormones.

2019-12-21 10:50:03,edolsp,2,1,"Hey, AFAB here. My situation is a bit weird, unlike most of the questioning posts I've seen here I don't really feel uncomfortable being treated as a female, and I don't particularly want to be a man. It's just sometimes I feel like it would be cool if I was one, at least for a bit?

A while back I worked at an amusement park as an operator during the summer. Our uniform was very baggy, I didn't need to talk much and since it was hot I always bundled up my hair into a hat. Basically, more than a few people mistook me for a guy, and every time they did I felt a small sort of thrill about it. I didn't really do anything about it since then, partially because it wasn't all that pressing and partially because I didn't know where to start.

My social circles are mostly nerd and STEM stuff, both of which are mainly male dominated, so a lot of the ways I feel comfortable behaving are those ""just one of the guys"" sort of behaviors.

2019-12-21 11:25:07,edow01,5,1,"Hi! so I was wondering if anyone here had stopped T midway when their voice was changing and can talk about their experience w me? Meaning like when your voice is still cracking and its not deep-deep yet. I have a lot of questions because I’m debating whether or not to do T for a bit (mainly bc I want bottom growth and voice changes is also a plus). 


So here are my questions (you don’t have to answer all of them if you don’t feel comfortable with them! thank u if you answer any btw!):

How long did you take T and how much before you stopped?

Does it continue to crack after you stop T? For how long?

Does it settle after a while? If yes, how long did it take for you?

What other effects of T did you experience alongside voice changing?

Did you take T specifically to deepen your voice? If yes, say you had the money and time to do voice training instead, would you have done that? What if you could have done vocal pitch surgery?

Can you still talk in your pre-T vocal range? Or is it too unnatural now?

Are you happy with the results?",NonBinary,What happens when you stop HRT midway of voice changes,1576952707.0,"{'created_utc': 1576927507, 'id': 'edow01', 'num_comments': 5, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Hi! so I was wondering if anyone here had stopped T midway when their voice was changing and can talk about their experience w me?

2019-12-21 19:25:47,edu49m,0,1,"Tldr; My mom says no binder or suiting (no matter how bad my dysphoria is) unless I can 100% afford it, even after I told her I'd save up for it.

Unfortunately because of my disabilities my mom is in charge of my money and how I spend it.  Any purchase must be run through her, no matter how small.  This is normally fine, she can be in control of my bills and I don't have to worry about it anymore, but as I transition to a more masc look I have to run everything by her.  That means no suits for me :(

And also unfortunately, my personal style is 1950's dresses (for femme) and suits (for masc).  My style is not cheap, especially at my size, so I make a lot of my own clothing.  I do have a large stash of fabric for such purposes, but not suiting or wool, which is what I'd need for casual menswear.  And I can't buy it, because my mom says no new fabric until I've run through my stash.

Now we come to the binder discussion.  I am overweight, and I asked my mom if it was okay to save up for a binder for when I hit 200lb, and that could be my goal.  She *completely* dismissed this idea, even with me saying I'll save up, it'll take awhile since my weightloss is mostly controlled by diet, etc etc.  Never mind that my dysphoria around my chest can sometimes cause depressive episodes.

Just because I dress femme 75% of the time doesn't mean I don't want to dress masc more often.  She doesn't ""understand"" the nonbinary ""thing"", as she'll often say.

Any purchase must be run through her, no matter how small.  This is normally fine, she can be in control of my bills and I don\'t have to worry about it anymore, but as I transition to a more masc look I have to run everything by her.  That means no suits for me :(\n\nAnd also unfortunately, my personal style is 1950\'s dresses (for femme) and suits (for masc).  My style is not cheap, especially at my size, so I make a lot of my own clothing.  I do have a large stash of fabric for such purposes, but not suiting or wool, which is what I\'d need for casual menswear.  And I can\'t buy it, because my mom says no new fabric until I\'ve run through my stash.\n\nNow we come to the binder discussion.  I am overweight, and I asked my mom if it was okay to save up for a binder for when I hit 200lb, and that could be my goal.  She *completely* dismissed this idea, even with me saying I\'ll save up, it\'ll take awhile since my weightloss is mostly controlled by diet, etc etc.  Never mind that my dysphoria around my chest can sometimes cause depressive episodes.\n\nJust because I dress femme 75% of the time doesn\'t mean I don\'t want to dress masc more often.

Let me first say that I love my husband with everything in me. He is my best friend and biggest cheerleader. 

I don’t know why it’s so hard to come out as NB to him. He is trans (ftm) and we have had many, many conversations about dysphoria (both his and mine), he helped ease my anxiety about changing my name last year (I just started going by my middle name, which was already really andro), and I really have no reason to think that he wouldn’t be supportive of me. But it’s hard. I’ve made all these changes without putting the “this is me coming out about my gender” sticker on it, but now I really really want to ask that he use they/them pronouns with me. We have a lot of NB friends and during group hang outs, pretty much everyone defaults to using “they/them” with me on accident, even though I haven’t asked for it. I never thought I would want that change so much until I experienced it, and now I never, ever want to be called “she” again by anyone close to me. 

But it’s hard. I feel like asking for that is too much. And I don’t want him to feel guilty for using she/her to refer to me to people I am not out to and will not come out to. And I don’t want to feel that inevitable crash of dysphoria when he has to use them. I know that I project a lot of my own internalized transphobia on to him, but I can’t help but think that he views my non-binary identity as less valid than his trans identity. I know he doesn’t really think that, but he has made some less-than-pc comments about nb people in the past that echo in my brain whenever I think about coming out to him.

only two people in my city know that i'm nonbinary. i've lived here since august and very carefully chose these two people based on comfort, acceptance, and trust. yesterday one of them told me she ran into my voice professor and told her my pronouns and what that means. she said, ""because it can be hard to reach up with that information, but since i've known her for six years, you can hold her accountable now! :-)"" i was so shocked i could only smile and nod. i cried about to the only other person who knows not even 30 minutes later, because i suddenly realized how panicked i was. i don't know how to proceed??? 

i'd been keeping it private (for the common reasons), but also because I've been trying to navigate presentation and ideas of medical transition, or lack thereof. i'm in grad school for opera and as far as I know, T isn't in my cards. i don't want to jeopardize my voice after honing my craft for the last 6 years, but i constantly worry about being criticized for it.

maybe it'd be easier if i was binary trans, if i has an undeniable desire to transition, if i acted less like my agab, if i looked ""More Trans"".

2019-12-25 06:18:31,efd0r6,2,1,"Hi! So I’m 19 AFAB, and recently, after talking to some trans friends, I started seriously questioning my gender identity. I grew up my whole life with parents that are supportive of most of the LGBT community, but get really mad when I bring up anyone on the “in between” spectrum (I.e. bisexuality, being non-binary. Anything not either gay or straight male or female). 

My whole life I’ve always hated being referenced to as a girl. I’ve hated being called “ma’am” “miss” and I’ve never been fully comfortable with she/her pronouns. I also have a double name, and one name is traditionally masculine, and one is traditionally feminine, but growing up I felt horribly uncomfortable with being called my female half of my name, and never really liked just the male half either. I hate that my breast have recently gotten bigger, I hated dresses as a kid, and I still to this day prefer to dress masculine, but some dresses are great too.  Because of all this I’m labeled as a “huge tomboy that has their feminine moments”

It recently come to a head when talking to a friend who is trans FTM and he is wanting to start his transition, and I asked him how he knew, and we got into a deep discussion about gender identity and dysphoria, and he said I should really look into the non-binary community. I did and I nearly cried because that... these people... they were JUST LIKE ME! I’d never had that before, and I didn’t know I could feel so comfortably seen. Then one night while questioning and practically knowing I’m not a girl, I played Sims 4, and created me as a non-binary character. Then I couldn’t stop looking at them because I had never in my life felt like I looked like a sims character until that moment. That moment when the me on the screen had a flat chest, short hair, and masculine clothes but still wore makeup, had an amazing party dress, and lovely high voice, I actually saw myself and teared up. 

I’m sorry if it sounds like I’m trying to convince you guys, but this is all so new to me, I feel like I’m still trying to convince myself I’m not somehow faking it. 

So now I truly believe I’m non-binary, I want to go by they/them pronouns, and I want to buy a binder... but that’s such a huge change. I’m terrified. I know it’s not safe to come out to my family, and I’m worried my friends will think it’s weird and treat me differently. I’m always at college, so I’m not too worried about coming out to my parents, but to actually put this change into affect into my life is a daunting task. I don’t want to change my name (because it’s already half feminine half masculine, it still feels like the right name for me) so that won’t be a problem, but I’m worried about my new pronouns, and the fact that I’m cutting my hair into a pixie cut in 2 days. 

How were you guys strong enough to do it? How’d you manage to get people to respect it? How did people react?

How’d you manage to get people to respect it? How did people react?\n\nTL;DR I believe I’m non-binary, and want to come out to my friends (family aren’t safe) how’d you do it?

Tonight, I'm staying with my parents for the holidays. I was downstairs after they went to bed petting my childhood cat (who is now an elderly little lady) and I started to reminisce and remember the fun moments I used to have with her and her now-dead brother. More importantly, I started to remember the _emotions_ I felt during those times. 

It's really hard to explain why that's so significant, but it's hitting me emotionally like a sack of potatoes. For the better part of the last decade, I'd been coasting in a mostly dissociative state. I felt no real connection to, well, _anything_ really, including my past self and my memories. I'd remember things as facts -- that they happened and that was that. Most new memories being made were either tossed by my brain or colored the same kind of gray.

Tonight, thinking back on those childhood memories, I realize that I again see them as _mine_ and that they're of _me_. It's such a freakin' beautiful and powerful realization. It reminds me that I made the right decisions, even though they were haaaaard.

Anyway, thanks for reading my rambling. I needed to organize my thoughts so I could understand why I just started bawling as I was petting the kitty.

&amp;#x200B;

After living through four gender identities (cis male, trans woman, demigirl, and now gender-apathetic \[I don't care about my own gender\]), and uncountable presentations under these, **I decided to get boobs, but I'm sticking with my otherwise currently-masculine body.** 

I'm keeping my beard, any clothes that still fit through the changes, everything. At least right now, all I want is to add boobs to my current appearance. So, I started wearing homemade breast forms! Here's some photos of the first time I tried this: [https://mastodon.social/@Supuhstar/103365524118220866](https://mastodon.social/@Supuhstar/103365524118220866)

My years-long plan involves me wearing silicone breast forms daily and going through GAHT only until my chest is how I like it, and cutting the hormones. Of course, I'll work with my endocrinologist to find the right balance of hormones to achieve this.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone has been super supportive, be they cis, NB, trans, etc! But I have gotten a good number of people telling me it looks uncanny, and will take some getting used to. One person even gave me the benefit of a long discussion with me about how they'd always thought about me transitioning MtF, and wasn't prepared for this possibility. It was a nice talk, and we're both looking forward to removing biases we didn't even know we had.

I totally understand all this, and I'm excited to see what else this will show me about the way our society views gender, and what I'll discover about myself. After all, the idea of ""the bearded lady"" has long been shorthand for a freak, and my appearance while wearing these homemade breast forms is currently similar to that. Over the past 11 years, I have prepared myself for all of this, so **I really am just very happy**, and I see any non-support as a fascinating view into social expectations around gender and self-expression, rather than some attack on me or something.

&amp;#x200B;

All that said, **I can't find much in the way of this on the internet. It seems that everyone I can find who wants to have boobs also wants to be femme.

So I'm nonbinary, pretty much agender, and otherwize mostly what's left is 'dragon'. I mean if I could present as 'genderless otherworldy dragon creature' that's my thing.

I really want pronouns that reflect my enby-ness but also my dragony other-ness. 

I love that fae/faer was made for these kinds of reasons, like yay fairypersons doing the thing! But they're also not the right pronouns for me. I tried them on early on but not the right vibe.

I've been using they/them because 'no other pronouns work for me' so let's have some fun!

So, my parents know that I am not cis, but not really the specifics of it. I have never really come out to them but just sort of heavily hinted at it. I thought that at best, they would eventually get it without my having to bear my soul to them (we are not a touchy-feely family); at the worst, they might pick up on it but be unable to be explicitly transphobic to someone who isn't explicitly trans. After about three years of being out socially, they (mostly) get it. They know my pronouns (even if they are bad at using them, they make an effort) and refer to me with an androgynous version of my birth name most of the time. (It was only earlier this year that I decided on Will; most people who know me still refer to me with the androgynous name). 

Because they have accepted my general transness relatively well and because there are starting to be some pretty noticeable changes with T, I think it's time for me to come out to them with a bit more intention. Specifically, I want to tell them about T and my preferred name. I do not consider myself to be a binary trans guy, so I am not sure how to explain this to them in a way that makes sense. I was also named after my grandmothers, and the one whose first name I have passed away this year. I am planning on keeping my birth names as middle names, but I am still afraid that this might be a sore subject. 

Even though they are pretty cool about this for 60-something conservative Boomers, I am still nervous about this, and would appreciate any advice!

2019-12-26 02:04:04,efp8ah,0,1,"Hi y’all. Trigger warning for talks of suicide, mental health issues, and body dysphoria.

I mostly only come home for the holidays, and I haven’t been to Cuba since 2017 when I mostly dressed in feminine clothes (AFAB) and just ignored comments about who am dating (I’ve been in a queer relationship for over three years now). However, I recently came out to my traditional Cuban parents as non-binary, and then found out we are going to Cuba for New Years.
In case y’all don’t know much about Cuba’s stand on LGBTQ+ rights, it ain’t good. Traditional ideals are valued and queer and trans* individuals are rarely seen or able to be themselves.
At my most comfortable, I usually dressed fairly masc and have “masc mannerisms.” Going to Cuba, I’m going to have to completely disregard my current wardrobe and basically go back in the closet. I am dreading that. I also won’t be able to talk about my partner of 3+ years, even though they are present in every aspect of my life—we went to the same college, have gone on vacations together, moved in together, etc. I’m going to pretend to be somebody I’m not while I’m Cuba and I’m terrified of what this trip will do to my mental health. 
A couple weeks ago I almost committed suicide because the body dysphoria was so terrible, and my depression has been getting considerably worse ever since. 
This trip won’t be good for me, but I have no way of getting out of it. 

My requests for y’all are:
Tips on how to feel more like myself while I’m not expressing my gender
What discreet mementos of my actual life could I bring with me?
Strategies to keep myself sane and healthy while I’m away from my partner and from my gender identity 
Support. Tons of support. 
Validation. Words of encouragement. Anything.

Trigger warning for talks of suicide, mental health issues, and body dysphoria.\n\nI mostly only come home for the holidays, and I haven’t been to Cuba since 2017 when I mostly dressed in feminine clothes (AFAB) and just ignored comments about who am dating (I’ve been in a queer relationship for over three years now). However, I recently came out to my traditional Cuban parents as non-binary, and then found out we are going to Cuba for New Years.\nIn case y’all don’t know much about Cuba’s stand on LGBTQ+ rights, it ain’t good. Traditional ideals are valued and queer and trans* individuals are rarely seen or able to be themselves.\nAt my most comfortable, I usually dressed fairly masc and have “masc mannerisms.” Going to Cuba, I’m going to have to completely disregard my current wardrobe and basically go back in the closet. I am dreading that. I also won’t be able to talk about my partner of 3+ years, even though they are present in every aspect of my life—we went to the same college, have gone on vacations together, moved in together, etc. I’m going to pretend to be somebody I’m not while I’m Cuba and I’m terrified of what this trip will do to my mental health. \nA couple weeks ago I almost committed suicide because the body dysphoria was so terrible, and my depression has been getting considerably worse ever since. \nThis trip won’t be good for me, but I have no way of getting out of it. \n\nMy requests for y’all are:\nTips on how to feel more like myself while I’m not expressing my gender\nWhat discreet mementos of my actual life could I bring with me?\nStrategies to keep myself sane and healthy while I’m away from my partner and from my gender identity \nSupport.

I've had a few days to think, and I'm still having trouble understanding how I didn't notice until now. Like, I've known that I like women for two years, how could I not notice that I'm also part man? I mean, it's really obvious in hindsight. Once I grew old enough to make my own fashion choices, my sense of fashion changed to be more androgynous. Heck, I never really cared about gender presentation in the first place. Like, the idea of trying to present in one direction or the other is foreign when I stop to think about it. Like, okay, I get it, I'm technically a woman, but what does that even mean? That I have certain body parts that some people are attracted to? I really shouldn't be that surprised that I sometimes feel like I'm also a man, because the concept of being a certain gender never really mattered to me in the first place.

I like the idea of experimenting with menswear, and I like the idea of having a male voice. Like, a few months ago, my mental voice randomly changed to male, and it is very dissonant to have a female physical voice and a male mental voice. And yet I'm thinking about using perfume, I recently got my ears pierced and I'm experimenting with jewelry and feminine accessories in general. My sense of fashion and by extension my gender presentation is going in two directions at once, and it's perfect.

I remember the tiny convention at my local library a month ago, when I cosplayed as Stevonnie, a nonbinary character from Steven Universe who is commonly coded as female due to their body and female voice actress. At the time, I identified as female, but for just that one evening, cosplaying as a character who isn't male or female, just an *experience*, felt right.

It was a huge step for me, but I also want to start very slow. I am on 20mg weekly. I wanted an extremely low dose because I do pass very well, and I am worried about facial hair growing or anything crazy happening. I hate my face and the female fat pattern I have. I hate that I can never gain muscle, id like my veins to pop out more, I hate how arched my eyebrows are. Sometimes I like the thought of facial hair, sometimes it scares me. I can’t tell if I’ve been so used to just making it work with what I have and being so used to being uncomfortable, that it became comfortable. I don’t do well with change to begin with. The thing is, last night I was just feeling around my face while watching a movie and I have felt hair on my chin that I don’t know if it was there or not before T. I am very hairy for an afab person. I’ve always had a pretty thick mustache that grew in at about the 6th grade. And light brown/blonde peach fuzz all over my entire face (I’m Italian). It did freak me out a little bit only because I was told I wouldn’t see any changes for a while, my doctor advised me many non binary people take this dose and are happy with the results. He also stated if I don’t like anything I can just stop taking it. The thing I want to know is, would it be possible that I could see results this soon? Or is it all in my head? Keep in mind I have been diagnosed with severe anxiety. I think the worst of everything and I haven’t been happy for a long time.

2019-12-26 06:23:40,efrx3v,13,1,"Hey y'all I am kinda new to all of this and am just trying to figure things out, so please excuse my long text post. I figured out that I was a lesbian in high school (currently finishing  up college) and have been getting better at accepting that part of my identity. But recently (about over the past 6 months) I have been slightly questioning if I could be nonbinary. 

I don't want to say anything to anyone unless I am certain so I am keeping it underwraps for now. I guess the some of the main issues is I don't know how to tell if one is nonbinary or not. I have gotten attached to my label as a lesbian because it feels right, but at the same time I don't know if the term women describes my experience. But there are still insecurities about whether I am just overanalysising things. I would consider myself on the more androgynous side of the spectrum, but will occasionally dress femininely. I am ok with being called she/her, but would also be okay with going by they/them. The main crux of the issue is I don't think that I have any dysphoria. I am pretty flat chested to begin with (have always been an A cup) so I don't think I would want top surgery.

I figured out that I was a lesbian in high school (currently finishing  up college) and have been getting better at accepting that part of my identity. But recently (about over the past 6 months) I have been slightly questioning if I could be nonbinary. \n\nI don't want to say anything to anyone unless I am certain so I am keeping it underwraps for now. I guess the some of the main issues is I don't know how to tell if one is nonbinary or not. I have gotten attached to my label as a lesbian because it feels right, but at the same time I don't know if the term women describes my experience. But there are still insecurities about whether I am just overanalysising things. I would consider myself on the more androgynous side of the spectrum, but will occasionally dress femininely. I am ok with being called she/her, but would also be okay with going by they/them. The main crux of the issue is I don't think that I have any dysphoria.

2019-12-26 17:15:51,efy0nx,2,1,"Hi all,

So I'm a transmasc guy pre-everything, though fortunately I've been able to pass pretty consistently and have been enjoying living as male or a masculine aligned NB.

 Recently however, I have been really bothered by my name, and how it does not fit my presentation. I don't terribly mind the name itself when I isolate it from the gendered connotations others see in it, but the female association it gives is now getting me into plenty of awkward situations. Using it when I look the way I do confuses people, and my counsellor admitted that seeing the name made her revert to she/her pronouns by accident. I feel awkward about choosing a new name, and while I have some options lined up that I've recently started trying out that I like (Lee, Winn, Daire) some shame and anxiety always makes me pause even though my current name doesnt feel comfortable. Without a name that truly expresses to people who I am, rather than suggest female connotations I dont personally relate to, it is more difficult to hold on to confidence about my sense of self.

Over Christmas I have been constantly called my current name and referred to with she/her pronouns, which has gotten incredibly uncomfortable. I am out with my family about being at least transmasculine nonbinary, but they continue to refer to me this way. 

So I had an idea which could be awful, but here goes: I'm considering asking my parents for help choosing a male or gender neutral name which I could take up in the new year. I am constantly unsure of how they will react (they veer wildly between being very hurtful in their responses, or very supportive) but I feel absolute dread at the thought of heading into another decade without really living my own life. 

If anyone has done anything similar, would you recommend it? Or any advice about finding names that are lowkey masc aligned? My birth name begins with an A, so if anybody had any suggestions beginning with the same letter that could help with convincing my parents, I suppose.

Thanks for any help!

TL;DR: Planning to ask my parents to help me choose a masculine or gender neutral name on time for the new year.

I don't terribly mind the name itself when I isolate it from the gendered connotations others see in it, but the female association it gives is now getting me into plenty of awkward situations. Using it when I look the way I do confuses people, and my counsellor admitted that seeing the name made her revert to she/her pronouns by accident. I feel awkward about choosing a new name, and while I have some options lined up that I've recently started trying out that I like (Lee, Winn, Daire) some shame and anxiety always makes me pause even though my current name doesnt feel comfortable. Without a name that truly expresses to people who I am, rather than suggest female connotations I dont personally relate to, it is more difficult to hold on to confidence about my sense of self.\n\nOver Christmas I have been constantly called my current name and referred to with she/her pronouns, which has gotten incredibly uncomfortable. I am out with my family about being at least transmasculine nonbinary, but they continue to refer to me this way. \n\nSo I had an idea which could be awful, but here goes: I'm considering asking my parents for help choosing a male or gender neutral name which I could take up in the new year. I am constantly unsure of how they will react (they veer wildly between being very hurtful in their responses, or very supportive) but I feel absolute dread at the thought of heading into another decade without really living my own life. \n\nIf anyone has done anything similar, would you recommend it? Or any advice about finding names that are lowkey masc aligned? My birth name begins with an A, so if anybody had any suggestions beginning with the same letter that could help with convincing my parents, I suppose.\n\nThanks for any help!\n\nTL;DR: Planning to ask my parents to help me choose a masculine or gender neutral name on time for the new year.

So during the summer I hung out for a little while with a new friend who was super comfortable with their nonbinary self and presenting however they wanted. I had been feeling increasingly uncomfortable with my own transition, having been on T for almost three years, initially out as nonbinary, but exploring masculinity/being a trans guy within that for quite some time. It was starting to chafe and just not feeling right, and I was noticing myself having a lot of anxiety over trying to be a man.

Not sure how much of that is just in my head, though, after being socialized to feel like I need at least a little mascara on before leaving the house. I’m really pale though and I look so washed out when I don’t do anything.

2019-12-27 19:34:08,egfo9o,1,1,"Hello r/NonBinary, first time posting in this subreddit.  A little rambling here as this is an issue I've rarely addressed with others in the past.

Usually, I'm able to ignore what stereotypical coding my clothing comes in (male, female, whatever).  I work in IT and need to be in business casual clothing from day to day.  The biggest problem I usually have with this is my love for suits which would be way overdressed for my position, though I'm tempted to just jump that ship at this point.

The issue I'm running into today is that someone complained I was wearing ""yoga pants and a tight T-shirt"" to work--which is not true, as I don't own yoga pants nor do I wear t-shirts to work unless I'm called in unexpectedly for an emergency (which, to me, means there isn't time to change shirts).  Now, the individual I directly report to said he didn't know where this issue came from and that I shouldn't worry about it--if I wear something that isn't appropriate he'll let me know.  Fine.   To avoid any issues anyway, I went to look at clothes today, and thus the cause of this post.

Due to my body shape traditionally ""female"" pants are usually the only types I can buy for business casual work clothes.  I have wide hips and a small waist.  I've lost about 120lbs and it just made the shape more obvious.  As I don't like, nor feel comfortable, in dresses and skirts, I tend to wear pants.  When I went to get new pants today I kept looking in the mirror and felt worse and worse about it.  When I was heavier everyone assumed my discomfort was because of my weight, but I used the extra weight to hide from a lot of things, including my shape.

2019-12-27 23:16:01,egiknv,2,1,"I hope it's ok to post here. I've been thinking about this for a while and can't see my therapist until winter break is over.

I'm a trans man who has been transitioning for about a year and a half, on T, and I consistently pass as a guy now. So the reason I'm here is I'm tired of assimilating in the gender binary. I hate the dichotomy that society forces us into and I want to fuck with it. Testosterone got rid of almost all of my dysphoria, so I'm happier and mentally healthier than I've been in a long time, but I still don't think I'm quite where I want to be yet.

I know I'm a guy, I know masculine pronouns feel the best for me. But at the same time, I kind of want to confuse people. I live in a conservative area and a lot of the people around here get upset at the idea of people transgressing their gender expectations. From what I can tell, people currently perceive me as an average gender conforming straight guy, which is better than when they viewed me as a gender conforming straight girl, but I'm still unhappy with it.

For one thing I'm gay, and also I really, really want to say ""fuck you"" to gender expectations. I've been restricting myself to masculinity in order to get respect from others and so that they view me as a man, but what I really want is to break out of that and do whatever I want, even though I know people won't treat me as well.

Another issue is top surgery. I used to have dysphoria for my chest until I started T, and then it vanished. I'm pretty satisfied with my body being the way it is currently. Honestly, the primary reason I want top surgery now is because it's the requirement to fix my gender marker. I hate being scared when I hand my ID to people since it outs me. I want an M on my license but the only way to do that here is to get a surgery. But getting a surgery for the sole purpose of changing my driver license doesn't seem like the best idea. But I also don't want to face discrimination since it's legal to not hire/fire someone for being trans or nonconforming where I live, so even if I conform in appearance at a future job interview, my legal information could still prevent me from getting a job if I don't change my marker to an M by getting surgery. I feel like I could get top or I couldn't and I would be happy both ways at the moment, but I only have so much time left in college where it would be easy to get it during a break before I start my career afterwards (if someone is even willing to hire me if I don't fix my legal gender.)

I want to visibly reject gender expectations but I still want people to call me by the right pronouns. I want to go swimming shirtless, but I don't want to be stared at. I want to change my body only because I want to and how I want to, but I also want to get hired after college. I want to be proud of my body in a society that says I should have either all male or all female characteristics.

So, much like I've answered many questions on the r/asexual, I'm going to describe my experiences and feelings as best I can here, and see how well they line up. Also, since I will be speaking from my own experience and doubts, please know that I don't mean anything as offensive, or doubting to the identities of others. Also, I understand that gender expression and gender identity are two different things, but I will be discussing my gender expression as it can be an indicator. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am AFAB, and have never been really feminine. Growing up, I never really learned how to do make-up, or deal with long hair, but a lot of that had to due with emotional abuse. My grandmother (my grandparents raised me) was the kind of person who would criticize, but not really teach me to improve. As I got older she had to bribe me to do things like get my eyebrows waved because, “They're growing together!”I hated girly clothes because of the shame cycles associated with buying them. I've always been overweight, and so it always felt crappy. I hated the extra time that things like make-up and long hair took to deal with. 

  
 I also hated being a woman for a long time. I hated having periods that were sometimes so bad that I had to skip class. I disliked having boobs because they kind of get in the way. But other than that, I hated the social expectations put on females. I hated that my emotional intelligence was expected to be higher, when I've always been socially awkward, not to the point of autism, but some of the social issues associated with ADHD and just lower emotional intelligence in general. I hated that being overweight is always seen as worse in women, even though all genders experience social BS from it. Once I realized I had ADHD, I resented that it wasn't caught sooner because I was a girl and wasn't hyper like my dad was. I hated how some people had doubted my intelligence or ability in the past or else felt like I only got ahead because I was a woman, even though there have only been a few examples of that in my life, thankfully. I hated that I already had mental illnesses that made my life difficult, but this thing I couldn't really change just added to that. But again, most of that isn't so much hating my gender as hating the way I'm treated by society because of my gender.

  
 However, at the same time, I didn't want to transition to being male. For one thing, men have a ton of BS standards on them too that didn't fit me, and frankly, I know that the BS of being a woman is nothing compared to what trans people go through. So I don't really want to put myself through that. Also, I'm kind of fine with she/her pronouns, because that's what I'm used to now. The times I've been misgendered, once or twice when I worked at Subway and once by a professor in class, I wasn't terribly insulted. I was surprised the first time, but when the professor did it, I remember my friend was more angry on my behalf than I was. I was just like, “Meh, I was in the back, and I look a little masculine, and maybe his eyesight is crappy.”  

  
But a lot of this has changed over time. Now that I'm with an amazing woman who loves me unconditionally and reminds me that she thinks I'm gorgeous every day, I've come to accept myself better, including my female anatomy. She loves long hair (on both men and women), and I've agreed to keep it long, so long as she cares for it for me, because I can't stand her sad face whenever I mention cutting it. She isn't repulsed by the facial hair I grow due to chronic illnesses, though she does help me shave it because the way it grows wouldn't look great even on a male-presenting person, and she even thinks my faint mustache is cute.

  
 In writing with her, ironically in male characters, I've realized I do like pretty things. I like ballgowns and bright colors, and while I have no interest in buying them, I can admit that side of myself. However, whenever I dress in bright colors and really put in effort, I often feel like I'm just wearing a costume. And I also don't think liking pretty things, or any of my other interests, should be just male or female interests. I love musicals, video games, writing, sci-fi, fantasy, etc... but none of that should be gender specific.

  
 I feel like if I woke up with a penis tomorrow, I wouldn't be terribly fussed about it, except for the scientific concerns. When I play characters in stories or video games, sometimes I play men, sometimes I play women. I feel like my gender isn't a big part of me either way. I don't have a big interest in presenting more androgynously because I've developed a style I think is often separate from gender, and well.... I still don't like putting tons of effort into my clothes, make-up, and hair. I have given serious thought to a more gender neutral name, something that can be for either gender but is typically more often seen on males. Like, the opposite of Lindsey. Problem is, Alex is my mom's name, and that's got emotional baggage. And Sam is my love's name, so that would just get confusing. 

  
So, basically, am I non-binary? Or do I basically disqualify myself by not caring enough to really express it in any meaningful way?

  
 I know this was super-long, but I wanted to get out everything I can remember right now. Thanks for reading if you got this far. I'm sure I forgot stuff, because covering 27 years of experience is difficult, so feel free to ask me any questions that might help.

Crossposted from r/enby

\---

I've identified as non-binary for close to a decade, even if I've only had a word for it for like 7. I definitely have a desire to lean more masc than I do in my voice and my style, and I dress pretty masculine, to balance out the natural ""femininity"" as a desire for androgyny, which doesn't quite work how I want it on this body, even when I try. Sometimes I pull it off, and other times I look like a child playing dress up or a teenager trying to find themself. 

I've wanted top surgery since I knew what it was, and my breasts gone since they first showed up, even if I didn't know that was any kind of options. I used to hope I would get cancer, as an excuse to make them go away forever, or dream of clipping them off with gardening shears just so I could be flat. I don't really think much about my genitals. (I have similar thoughts about robotic limbs, but I think thats just because I've always had bad knees, and want to be able to hike and run more without needing to take it easy the next day.)

If someone asks me where I would want to go in time travel, it's always into the future, where there's at least a chance that I could be respected, or seen without gender, and truly androgynous, along the robots and the aliens and the concepts of people either not giving a shit, so it's normal, or finally realizing it's not a joke.

I'm exhausted by people calling me ma'am or miss, and enjoy it a lot more when someone calls me sir or him or mister, but I don't know if that's because it's more comfortable to just not be seen as a woman in a world where no one seems to recognize or care that there could be another option.

Every single time I meet someone new, it's a whole new struggle to try to get them to respect a set of they/them pronouns, and not gender me constantly. I'm most content when I'm not either, but I'm so worn down with trying to get people to just respect me for who I am, that I wonder if it would just be an easier and happier life for me to just transition, and become a man.

My parents have known for two years, and my mother has never once tried to get it right. I've talked to her about being a man instead, and top surgery, and she tells me not to mutilate myself, or make any mistakes I can't take back, and stop playing pretend when I'd never be a man, just a boy. She knows I've never wanted breasts, I cried the first time she made me wear a bra, and she told me to just suck it up, because this was how things were. She doesn't care about sexuality, but gender seems to be a sticking point. I don't talk to her much anymore, and she blames me for it, but I'm tired of her never trying.

I've talked about maybe transitioning before, and my friends don't really care, but other people in the Enby community have called me a traitor, and a faker, and giving us a bad name. People in the trans community have told me I shouldn't be in either, and stop trying to take attention away from people who need it, and have real problems. I don't feel like I have a community, for this, even with friends who also struggle with their Non-Binary nature. I've had younger Enby's in my school and friends tell me they looked up to me, because I wasn't ever shy about talking about it, and fought so hard for it, and were glad I was just some stupid punk who didn't care if people liked me where my gender counted. I'm glad I could put on that brave face for them, and make it easier for them, but it's been such a long time, and I'm so tired of having to fight every time I meet a new coworker, or a kid gets in a fight with their mom in the restaurant I work at about whether I'm a boy or a girl, and no one even bothers to think to ask me how I feel, or who I am.

I'm exhausted by no one bothering to read a pronoun pin, which feels like a band-aid and the ""token attempt"" I'm supposed to make in polite company to reaffirm myself, but never step on any toes while I do it, because I'm 23, and I'm an adult now, shouldn't I know better? I'm not in college anymore, I need to settle down and be polite about it, they don't ""mean"" it, when they can't be bothered to try and get my name or my pronouns correct. They don't know any better, and a restaurant isn't somewhere to learn.

I'm so fucking tired, of having to look myself in the eye in the mirror every morning, with my shoulders bowed and my heart broken, screaming internally that I'm valid, and I matter, and my identity is real. It means something, and I deserve respect. I'm exhausted from staring at the floor in the shower, so I don't need to think about being in the wrong body, and how if I can just see the right doctor, with the right paycheck, I can fix it if I'm lucky. I'm tired of pressing a binder down flat, day after day, under flannels and turtlenecks and too-tight jeans with holes in the knees, and telling myself that I look how I want, and this is confusing enough that someone might pause for once, before calling me miss, until I open my mouth. I'm tired of having to fight my own useless brain to tell myself I'm a person, every morning, before I face the rest of the world who will tell me I'm not.

Everything about who I am is too much, too hard, not normal, not natural, and a bother, and a hindrance. Why should anyone else have to try, even a little bit, just because I can't ""make up my mind""? Why should I ever dare to speak up, and make them feel uncomfortable for getting it wrong, and make this their fault, when it's clearly mine for daring to exist how I do?

I'm tired of no one trying. And i'm tired of it being my fault.

I definitely have a desire to lean more masc than I do in my voice and my style, and I dress pretty masculine, to balance out the natural ""femininity"" as a desire for androgyny, which doesn\'t quite work how I want it on this body, even when I try. Sometimes I pull it off, and other times I look like a child playing dress up or a teenager trying to find themself. \n\nI\'ve wanted top surgery since I knew what it was, and my breasts gone since they first showed up, even if I didn\'t know that was any kind of options. I used to hope I would get cancer, as an excuse to make them go away forever, or dream of clipping them off with gardening shears just so I could be flat. I don\'t really think much about my genitals. (I have similar thoughts about robotic limbs, but I think thats just because I\'ve always had bad knees, and want to be able to hike and run more without needing to take it easy the next day.)\n\nIf someone asks me where I would want to go in time travel, it\'s always into the future, where there\'s at least a chance that I could be respected, or seen without gender, and truly androgynous, along the robots and the aliens and the concepts of people either not giving a shit, so it\'s normal, or finally realizing it\'s not a joke.\n\nI\'m exhausted by people calling me ma\'am or miss, and enjoy it a lot more when someone calls me sir or him or mister, but I don\'t know if that\'s because it\'s more comfortable to just not be seen as a woman in a world where no one seems to recognize or care that there could be another option.\n\nEvery single time I meet someone new, it\'s a whole new struggle to try to get them to respect a set of they/them pronouns, and not gender me constantly.

They are super sweet and have provided a million different kinds of support throughout my partner and I’s relationship. I don’t have the best relationship with my family and they truly have been a surrogate family to me and I love them to death! 

While they have been very supportive of my name change and my more authentic self-expression, they struggle a ton with pronouns and, perhaps a bigger issue, with being corrected. 

Generally, they misgender me (by accident) about 75% of the time, but if I correct them at any point: 
1. The whole conversation stops while they backtrack and apologize 
2. They start to monologue about how they are trying their best and it’s just *really hard*.
3. They then misgender me 100% of the time because they are so shaken up about the whole thing. 

And I just don’t know what to do. I love them and I know they mean well and think they are trying... but I also feel incredibly dysphoric and invalidated and exhausted having to deal with it and not feeling able to fully express myself for fear of upsetting my partner’s family...

I feel like lately I'm becoming disillusioned with the nb identity, and I'm not sure why. I've considered myself non-binary for years. But first I journeyed from ""woman"" to ""genderqueer"" to ""trans man,"" before landing on non-binary. And now I'm relating more to things like ""transmasculine,"" ""nb man,"" and ""gnc guy."" 

Part of me worries that it was more about not feeling able to fully transition than an actual expression of my identity. 

I recently went from wearing makeup daily and a combo of men's and women's ""androgynous"" clothes to only feeling ok in all men's everything and no makeup. I'm not sure I can pinpoint why. I told myself that I would feel comfortable branching out again when I start passing as cis male. 

I find myself questioning what the nb identity really means for us. How does it change our lives?     Internal identity feels so ephemeral. Outward expression feels almost shallow.  I know intellectually that I strongly believe only allowing people to be ""men"" or ""women"" is wrong, and that gender is mostly bullshit, and that transgressing gender norms in public is radical and important... So what is my freaking problem? Why do I see other nb people and struggle to relate? I think some of it has to do with age, I'm 29 and I don't see myself in 19 y/os anymore.

I made an appointment at Planned Parenthood when i was there with a flatmate, simply knowing that i want to be...less apparently my assigned-at-birth gender.

However, now the appointment is tomorrow, and i don't really know what i want to ask for.

As someone assigned-male-at birth, i suppose i want to combat/prevent any hairloss or receding of hairline, regrow what hair and part of my hairline i have already lost if possible, and get...softer/less masculine features. I also want to be less hairy in a lot of places, but i think i will need to seek out procedures for that. I simply want what i can get from HRT in the meantime.

However, i very much don't want to be a girl. I also very much don't want breasts. That would make me dysphoric in a brand new way.

So far, all i know to tell the clinician tomorrow is what i have written here and that i want my prescription of Finasteride refilled.

Does anyone have any suggestions? Regarding things that might be good to ask about or for?

So I'm still having a hard time feeling valid (I frequently tend towards imposter syndrome) and I am still struggling to figure out how ""out"" I want to be.  

I find this all super scary and don't have a lot of people I can talk to about it.

About me: 31 so kinda older, been out as bi (pan now, I'm inclusive af)  for years came out as a pre-teen but didn't find a lot of support in the community so kinda kept it to myself. AFAB, fat (or plus size w/e) fairly feminine presenting currently. Oh, should probably mention: Agender Demigirl,  she or they.

I only really came to realize what's up a couple years ago as I was entirely unfamiliar with the concept of a nonbinary identity. Finally warmed up to it, realized it fit how I feel pretty well. 

I came out to a handful of people and a ""friend"" (I'm not sure if she warrants that title currently) that I expected to be supportive really wasn't. She tried to tell me how I feel about myself. Has been generally transphobic and shitty since, she is currently blocked. 

I feel like that really unexpected resistance really threw me off and has me reconsidering how out it's safe to be.

2019-12-31 02:24:33,ehwce5,22,1,"See the thing is, I’m AFAB, so when I create a new character in a video game where I get to customize said character, my first thought is to go for the female character. However, the female character always has a very feminine body shape, so i go ‘ok-well the male character will look more androgynous, RIGHT?’ 

And it’s almost like as I’m thinking this, the video game developers are going ‘lol nope’

So I try out the male character thing and i think ‘hm this makes me dysphoric too’ and I go welp guess I’ll go with the gender-neutral opti-OH wait. How silly of me to assume there isn’t an option that is neither ultra-feminine nor super-masculine. 

This happened awhile ago with a school website. My school was introducing a new math website where you could practice your math facts in a ‘fun and educational way’, and you got to make an avatar. So I go in, and the first customization option is ‘male or female’.
