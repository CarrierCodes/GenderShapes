I hate my body because it is impossible for me personally to feel androgynous with it. I have a massive hip to waist ratio (IE tiny hips, curvy waist). I have a flat-ish stomach. I have a massive butt. Like, kardashian level. I honestly hate it though. I feel terrible because I know there are women out there who spend their entire waking lives dieting, self-harming and exercising to get a body similar to mine. And here‚Äôs me feeling down because I‚Äôve got it and I don‚Äôt want it. The guilt in that is insane. I can‚Äôt even be grateful that I meet current western beauty standards that are somewhat able to give me privilege. I would trade it for a less curvy body in a second if there was a way. Because of my bum and thighs, I can‚Äôt fit into clothing made for males such as chinos and shirts. I can‚Äôt even fit into female trousers unless they‚Äôre a curvy petite range. The dysohoria that comes with this is KILLING me. I never look how I want because of my boobs, and even if I got a binder, my butt curves out and my thighs are very feminine and I just know that wearing gender neutral clothing and not looking androgynous is going to be worse than gender dysphoria. I had an eating disorder for about 8 years and I‚Äôm recovery now - but I recently realised that so much of it was spurred by subconsciously wanting to lose weight to ‚Äòappear‚Äô more ‚Äòandrogynous‚Äô.


I rarely feel like myself when wearing a tight dress, but it fits an aesthetic and I get compliments (and therefore, validation) and I enjoy that aspect. But I‚Äôm done with dressing just to suit my female body type. I need to unpack my own thoughts and ideals that make me believe androgyny = only attainable with a gender-obscure body, but also I think I need to try and reduce how feminine my body looks because even being naked looks horrible to me.

2019-07-01 17:39:29,c7wjv7,8,15,"I'm 22 years old and I have identified as NB since I was about 16-17. I have only openly told 1 person,and that's my cousin who is also probably my only friend as well. My family is extremely homophobic,and even more so transphobic. Not in the ""we hate gays! Abominations!"" type way,but in a ""we will pretend to like them and support them to their faces while we privately laugh and mock or question and deny their existence in private"" type of homophobic/transphobic.

I don't feel accepted or even valued in my family. There is no other queer person in my family that could give tips or guidance,so i had to walk the path alone in my childhood.  I stopped going by Savana (my birthname) and started going by Eli (part of middle name). When people online call me Eli,I feel such an enpowering and happy feeling in my heart. I never told my family that I would prefer to be called Eli,I give them subtle hints here and there...that they never catch onto.

I feel more at peace when people mistake me for a boy and call me ""young man,sir,boy,he"" etc, because it makes me feel like I successfully broke the binary. Like I can be seen as either,both,or all,by people...and it the feeling goes away when my family goes out of their way to ""correct"" the person.

I am scared of coming out as NB to my family. I have heard their conversations making fun and belittling trans people. They would never physically hurt me or threaten me,but mental damage is enough to break me about now.

So, obviously I haven't come out to my parents as nb and I'm a little worried.

Honestly I think my mother would be mostly confused but it's my father I'm worried about. To explain why involves my (attempted) coming out to him as asexual.

So this was years ago and I decided to come out as asexual to avoid all the ""interested in anyone?""  question which were pretty frequent. But because it's asexuality of course you have to explain the concept before you explain that ""I am this"". Which I think would be the same case for my parents with nb. But anyway, it didn't go well. After the explanation he kinda laughed derisively and said ""that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard of"". It felt kind of like ""I could hate these people, but I honestly don't think they're worth my time"" so I didn't come out.

I'm worried this scenario will repeat itself when I try and come out as nb. Or worse. 

The thing is I do want to come out to them. We're really close and we live in the same city so see each other 2-3 times a month and we talk almost constantly.

I know I don't want HRT. I just want to be infertile and never menstruate. Carrying a growing child in a womb seems like something my body by all means should NOT be capable of.

I'm alright with holding off on seeking tubal litigation for now, because maybe there's a chance this feeling goes away once I'm out of my 20s. For now I just need to stop menstruating so I can feel normal, and not like a woman or a future mother.

I've done research and it's been shown that medically suppressing menstuation has the same side effect risks as traditional birth control (where a person does continue to menstuate).

I've reached out to my local LGBTQ center and they provided a list of some local trans-affirming doctors that will take my insurance.

I'm worried that telling a doctor that I'm trans would mean that I'd be expected to accquire a psychiatry note before achieving a prescription. I'm worried that a doctor might pressure me into considering HRT because they don't believe in nonbinary genders and they'd mistake me for a binary transgender person.

I'm worried that not telling a doctor anything about gender dsyphoria would mean my request for menstual suppression would be denied. I'm worried that identifying as nonbinary to a doctor would mean my request is denied, because the doctor might not believe nonbinary genders are real, or at least not as serious as being binary transgender.

tl;dr

Should I identify myself to a new doctor as transgender, nonbinary, or cisgender in order to achieve a prescription to medically suppress menstruation?

I remember thinking I was nonbinary before I even had the language to describe that. If I knew about they/them pronouns and whatnot at a young age, I think I would have done that in a heartbeat. I remember standing outside some gendered restrooms and wondering why there wasn't a third option as a little kid back in 2002 at the age of 4 and then my mom ushering me to go into the women's restroom. I found some school curriculum from an IEP I had in elementary with the teachers noticing that I didn't know I was a girl and they had to teach me that I was one. I developed chest dysphoria when I hit puberty and have been basically wearing sports bras since then because normal bras are very dysphoria inducing. I would watch Trans men transition videos and I never cared about them looking more masculine or anything but would get jealous at their top surgery and the scars they'd have and think I'd rather have top surgery scars and a flat chest than the flesh weights I carry.... 

But for a while because of my chest dysphoria I assumed I was a transgender man, but my mom found out after telling a friend about it via passing notes and she got really upset and over time I realized I didn't want to be a man because I was gendered as ""he"" once and it felt gross to me, but when a professor a few years later addressed me as ""they"" I felt euphoria. 

I have long hair and I hate it. It makes me so inmistakably female. I wish I can cut it, but I'm scared if I cut it exactly how I want to it means cracking the egg. My transfemme partner bought me a binder for our anniversary and I really liked it but she got me one size too small on accident so it wasn't the best to wear in the world but I really want to try binding again if I can go one size up... 

I know this is very rambly and probably doesn't make a lot of sense. It's just hard when the cis don't understand you, but binary trans people frequently invalidate your existence. I'm a generally moderate person politically and I'm not taking this on as an identity for a political agenda.

Hello all. I recently came out as Agender and so far I have had mild struggles, mostly with dysphoria and being misgendered. But yesterday I hit a new problem: I wished with all my being that I could stop being trans and just be cis. 
Some background- I have been goth for a long time but my clothing style has changed from overly sexualized femme clothing to more neutral band t-shirts and black jeans. Also I am married and my partner is cis but is extremely supportive of my transition. That being said, a comment he made to me yesterday has me in full panic mode and I am not sure why. All he said was that sometimes he felt guilty for still finding himself attracted to more femme presenting goth people. And there is nothing wrong with him being attracted to that style. And he said he still thinks I am very attractive. But I just wanted to die when I heard that. I wish so much that I could put on a short skirt again and just feel comfortable. I want to be the sexiest person I can be for him but I feel like I never will be with my more neutral style. Has anyone else had this issue? What do I do to feel better? At this moment it makes me feel so bad that I just want to jump back in the closet and go back to being miserable in my own skin...",NonBinary,Struggling,1562101023.0,"{'created_utc': 1562075823, 'id': 'c89j1o', 'num_comments': 3, 'score': 5, 'selftext': 'CW: dysphoria, triggering thoughts/comments\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nHello all.

I just came out to myself in March and started buying clothes on the ""other side of the stores"". Not long after I find my self in the position to be able to backpack the world for an extended period of time.

Has anyone here backpacked through Asia, Oceania, Africa, Europe, south America while fem or Non-binary? What items do you recommmend me to bring? I'll try to go off the beaten path. Ill be away between 6 months and a year.

Backpacking presents challenges, opportunities and harsh realizations as Non-binary

Facts:
I'll be backpacking: I need to travel super light.
I'll visit many countries and regions: I'll face different cultures and acceptance towards a feminine ""guy"" (my presentation is androgynousfem but voice and mannerisms mostly masc).

Choosing what I'll take will be a challenge as I need to balance not taking much but feeling cute but prepared when passing by through an homophobic culture. A Chinese person told me that therem I'll have the ""immunity"" of a foreigner. I'm not as sure about small town China or Rusia or some African countries or south america, for example.

An awesome realization is that my fem clothes use way less space (tiny panties, short shortsm tight jeans, tight t-shirts, ankle socks). However, the clothes won't be as cute as I like them: nonglitery things and i may need to add some ""unisex"" items.

I've bought some cute shoes... they'll stay behind :(
I won't bring dresses or skirts :(
I won't bring make up: mostly the space and weight :(

Are you a sucker for romance? Are you nonbinary (or just struggling with gender in general)? This book hits those two automatically.

Blurb:

It's just three words: I am nonbinary. But that's all it take to change everything.

When Ben De Backer comes out to their parents, they're thrown out of their house and forced to move in with their estranged older sister, Hannah, and her husband, Thomas, whom Ben has never even met. Struggling with an anxiety disorder compounded by their parents' rejection, they come out only to Hannah, Thomas, and their therapist, and try to keep a low profile in a new school.

But Ben's attempts to survive the last half of senior year unnoticed are thwarted by when Nathan Allan, a funny and charismatic student, decides to take Ben under his wings. As Ben and Nathan's friendship grows, their feelings begin to change, and what started as a disastrous turn of events looks like it might just be a chance to start a happier, new life.

Representation:

MC and their best friend are nonbinary

Love interest is bisexual, as well as a POC

I'm gonna paste my Goodreads review here for your reading pleasure - TL;DR is at the top.

~~~


TL;DR: Every person struggling with their gender needs this book. Bottom line, cut and dry. Also, trigger warning if you're reading this: this book can get very intense at certain points. Like, anxiety levels of intense. It only happens about twice or thrice, and they occur mostly toward the end, but I'd proceed with caution. Even I had to put the book down and take a moment to process them. There's also unsupportive parents, misgendering, and brief implications of body dysphoria.

""'Whatever happens,' his grip tightens a little, 'I wish you all the best, Benjamin De Backer.' He says it with a smile. 'You deserve it'."" - pg. 208, and a quote I might paraphrase and get tattooed on me, or at least framed. This quote made me cry on and off for a good ten minutes, because it just kinda hit me. I don't have the words to explain why, but it just... let's just say I've never happy-cried, much less for a book. I've always heard of crying from relating too hard to a book, but Deaver's the first person to actually make me feel it. And for that, I thank you.

BUT on to the review. 

But seriously, this book is amazing! I think this is the first book I've ever given a 5-star review for. I'm normally not someone who likes giving ""abolutes"". I typically settle for 4-stars. Which is odd, because I'm a fantasy person. I like fantasy and adventure. When I pre-ordered this book, seeing that it was an interracial NBLM (nonbinary loving male) relationship, I was hooked. Yet, I still had doubts on whether I'd complete the whole thing or not.

I understand why people may have gotten frustrated at Ben's constant self-doubt, as well as the natural lulls in conversation. But personally, I feel like it made their character more relatable. Maybe that's the issue I've been having with other books I read: the conversations sound too formal, especially when it's out of character. I could actually relate to Ben, and this is coming from a person of color. The repetitiveness, the constant ""What if I'm fucking this up"" even where there's no obvious reason they should - describes me to a T, even with mundane situations.

I believe the only thing that could give is if someone is nit-picky with grammar and punctuation issues. Especially in the first half, where run-ons were rampant. There were a few misspellings, a few instances of where the author neglected quotations. But it didn't make the book awful. I'd say it like this (and correct me if I'm wrong on this quote): You can have a good story with bad graphics, but you can't have a bad story with good graphics. It's the best analogy I could come up with.


Plot-wise, I really enjoyed reading. There were days I wanted to just keep going, but reader's fatigue would mean that I got nothing out of it. Sometimes the time-skips could be a little out of proportion, or I had a hard time tracking what day it was, but again, did not distract from the reading.

Now, a therapy scene. One that seems kinda controversial in the Goodreads review page of this book, involving the conflation of ace/aro individuals with touch aversion. While I don't agree with it, I also don't agree with the reviews shaming it. Maybe it's because I'm seeing a therapist who isn't 100% knowledgeable on things (when I expressed my gender-nonconformity in terms of clothing style, she conflated it with ""genderfluidity""). But I don't think Deaver should be blamed for such. While it could be annoying to read, I think the therapist being ignorant in that sense was realistic.

I could ramble on and on, but I'd end up entering spoiler territory. All I have to say is this: if you're nonbinary, no matter the color of your skin, you need to read this. I nearly cried when the romance reached its head (after many bouts of secondhand embarrassment, of course) because it was done so beautifully. It makes me feel... hopeful, in a way. That maybe I'll find someone like Nathan.

2019-07-05 14:20:39,c9ghk9,30,54,"**Content warning: some transphobia and specifically transphobic bullshit about HRT**

I'm nonbinary and transmasculine. I've been using they/them pronouns exclusively for over a year and wearing mostly masc clothes + a binder for almost that long. I recently started taking low-dose T and I'm really loving it so far. 

My mom is bi and an artist so she basically lives in the queer community. I grew up with queer and trans babysitters and family friends and relatives - seriously, I have more queer family than straight family on mom's side - so I'd hoped that she'd be more accepting, even though she could never get my trans bff's pronouns right. 

When I came out to her about my pronouns it took her a long time to take me seriously and there were a lot of arguments. She's never identified as particularly feminine, so she sort of sees womanhood as a cross she has to bear in order to fight for the cause of feminism. So me transitioning is like abandoning womanhood for her. She did eventually come around and has been really supportive of me being nonbinary - buying me they/them pronoun pins, telling our family friends and relatives, etc. She still struggles with the pronouns but I think she's trying. 

HRT has always been a line for her though. Whenever I brought up the idea of it she would suggest that it would make me gain weight (and she has a LOT of internalized fatphobia) or aggressive/violent or unable to have children. None of this is true, but she ofc doesn't believe me when I tell her that.

Anyways, I started T while she was out of the country and I've struggled with telling her, but my voice is going to drop soon so I bit the bullet yesterday. All she said was ""oh well."" and got really quiet. It's pretty clear from the way she reacted that she's disappointed. I think she was okay with me being nonbinary as long as she could think of it as like ... some sort of feminist ""redefining womanhood"" type of move, like drag or something. But that's hard to justify now that I'm taking T, so we're back to me abandoning the cause of feminism to play for the other team. :|

Dislikes revealing gender/sex online  

Dislikes revealing sexuality/partner as it outs my gender/sex  

Feels that my assigned gender is a performance for others  

Has subconsciously gravitated towards dressing more androgynous over time  

Now consciously dresses more androgynous  

Still doesn't see self as a crossdresser   

Allows others to assume pronouns but has no idea how I would answer if asked my preferred pronouns  

Would be utterly cool with waking up as the opposite sex  

Would be cool with a lot of the results of transition  

Relates to a lot of NB/trans content  

Feels that my appearance is in some way permanently preventing me from growing up no matter what I do  

Can see early crushes as versions of what I might have looked like or wanted to look like/act like as the opposite sex  

Has never felt very attached to a gender conforming character of my sex no matter how much I liked or admired them   

Romanticises the transition of others and a hypothetical transition of an alternate me even though I know it's a long terrifying and difficult process in real life that no one wishes to have to go through  

Plans to change my name anyway  

Enjoys the most androgynous aspects of my physique despite them hindering my performance of my assigned gender  

Doesn't want to try harder to perform my assigned gender successfully even though photo evidence suggests it is possible for me to pull off and others like it 

Feels that others are more attached to my assigned gender than I am

Can't really imagine growing up into an older version of my assigned gender 

Also me:

Allows others to assume my gender and pronouns and isn't especially bothered by them 

Pretty chill with/indifferent to my social role, don't really think I would fit in any better overall with the opposite sex  

Doesn't experience gender dysphoria by any typical 'valid' description

Not that fussed about my body

Doesn't really plan to transition no matter how much I like the thought experiment sometimes

Doubts those people saying I'm probably trans 

Doubts those saying I'm cis

Knows transition wouldn't fix my self hatred because at the end of the day it's only gender and I've got bigger problems

Sometimes kinda wishes I'd personally never discovered trans or NB content even though I'm glad it exists for others

Makes posts like this even though it doesn't change anything and probably isn't productive

I'm feeling super love-y but I'm also just really happy that after all these years I've found a term that fits what I've always felt and there's a stellar community to back me up. 

So. Story time. Today at the grocery store I (AFAB enby) was waiting in line. I'm dressed rather femme, as I sometimes do, and I'm mega busty so like...I understand why people gender me as female. They probably always will. (Not on T; no desire to and researching more on breast reduction). 

The other cashier was calling, ""ma'am I'm open here"" and I was *completely* oblivious that they were talking to me. 

They obviously were trying to be polite so I chose not to correct them. But I would have preferred even a ""miss"" over the dreaded ""ma'am"". This cashier was a middle-aged person but I'm not gunna make that an excuse for them. I live in a pretty liberal, progressive area so most people have heard of certain terms even if they don't use them or understand fully. 

This particular grocery store...well, I used to work for the company. We were told to try to not use ""sir"" or ""ma'am"" for people. But I understand too, it can be difficult to get someone's attention when you are unfamiliar with them. 

Now I feel like I should have spoken up. Maybe the cashier could have said, ""excuse me, you in the black striped shirt"" or something. Or even saying ""excuse me sir or miss?"" 

Would you have said something? Don't you think it would better the community as a whole if we all started to very gently correct people and ask them to use other descriptors? 

I can't help feeling like I let you all down. I've chosen to be a part of this community and I should be fighting for our rights and visibility. If we stay silent...well...nothing will come of that. If we walk away from a scenario like that, we're not helping the situation and I hate it when I read people's stories of being misgendered and it ruining their day.

TL;DR at end of post

This is a thing that happened to me about 4 years ago now. I think it‚Äôs a pretty funny story, so why not post it here? Just for context, all of this happened before I identified as LGBT+, but I knew the terms and was supportive of the community. I was also born female (becomes relevant later).  

There was this girl who used to live in my neighborhood, and she and my sister were in the same grade, so naturally they became good friends (our moms became friends too). I‚Äôm a year above the both of them, so while not particularly close, I still hung out with the girl. I never really liked her, but because she lived really close and my mom was friends with the girl‚Äôs mom, I was forced to hang out with her a lot. 
The girl and I got into arguments a lot (mainly because we were both stubborn little brats). The girl also grew up in a very Christian home. Her dad played piano in the church band and once they took my sister and I to an anti-abortion rally. Naturally, this girl is now very homophobic and transphobic due to her upbringing. (Example: she loves Panic! At The Disco, but refuses to listen to Girls/Girls/Boys because it‚Äôs pro-LGBT+.)
Anyways, one day my sister and I were over at her house playing a tabletop game called ‚ÄúThe Game of Life.‚Äù The girl, my sister, the girl‚Äôs brother, and I were playing. (Explication of game at the end of this post!) The game pieces are shaped like tiny cars and they have slots for you to place blue or pink pegs in. The pegs are colored that way because they‚Äôre supposed to represent the genders of who is in the car, however, the colors of the pegs are more of a novelty, and don‚Äôt impact the game at all. 
To start, everyone has to put a peg in their car that represents them. Ever since the age of 7, I‚Äôve had issues with the color pink, so I put a blue peg in the car. When the girl realized what I had done she began screaming at me, saying that I was playing the game wrong, and I had to be pink because I was a girl. She claimed that I would forever be known as transgender in that game because I didn‚Äôt like pink. (Btw, my sister and the girl‚Äôs brother didn‚Äôt care what color I was, they just wanted to play.) I don‚Äôt remember if I changed colors or not, I just remember being both very angry and confused. I wanted to get back at her, but her brother beat me to it.

The girl‚Äôs brother is about three or four years younger than her (five or six younger than me), and they can‚Äôt get along with each other for more than an hour. Therefore, our mutual hatred for the girl meant that her brother and I are good friends despite the huge age gap. 

Anyways, back to the game.
There are some events in The Game of Life that you can‚Äôt skip over, and one of them is getting married. To get back at the girl for yelling at me, her brother (who was in second grade at the time), placed a second blue peg in his car, claiming that he was in a gay relationship. This made the girl frecking explode. She ran to her mom to tattle that her brother married a guy in the board game. Her mom was just annoyed by the girl‚Äôs behavior though and brushed it off. 

To my knowledge, the brother never got in trouble for doing that, and I‚Äôm glad he didn‚Äôt. 

This memory still brings me joy for two reasons:
1) A homophobe called me out for being trans, long before I knew I was.
2) A homophobic, transphobic, most-likely-to-become-a-Karen, girl got got by a second grader who just barely knew what bearing gay meant. 


What is this game I mentioned:
For those of you who don‚Äôt know what The Game of Life is, you spin a spinner to move forward; the goal is to get to a retirement home and have as much money as possible. You land on various life events (such as a tree falling on your house, having a child, getting married, etc.). Some events force you to pay or earn money, but you also have to pay bills and can even invest in the stock market. Also some events like getting married are unskipable. Overall though, it‚Äôs a pretty fun family game. 

TL;DR
I chose to be a blue game piece instead of a pink one, and this girl flips out. Her younger brother then got gay married in the game in order to get back at her.

2019-07-08 19:49:20,capy3n,13,5,"I've been thinking about what the gender binary is, because I think there's actually two ways of thinking about it that I haven't seen addressed as two separate ideas. 

The first way is the traditional gender binary that is composed of two opposite mutually exclusive categories that are defined by each other. I think of this as the man/woman binary. Like a light switch that can be on or off with no inbetween. I think it's clear to us that this doesn't represent how gender operates in people's lives and that this needs to be dismantled. 

The second way I see the binary is as two opposite groups that are defined by each other, but aren't mutually exclusive. I think of this as a masculine/feminine binary. Instead of the light switch which has on and off, I think about it as an attribute like something being hot or cold where something can be hot, but not hot in comparison to say the sun.  Masculinity and femininity are part of gender and we know they exist, but they have no discernable midpoint between the two. It helps me to imagine an absolute femininity and an absolute masculinity that are both unattainable. In this binary every position in this binary can be understood as either masculine or feminine if held in relation to it's opposite. In such a binary masculinity and femininity still retain meaning and it's still possible to become more feminine or masculine. And any assertion to being masculine or feminine in the binary can be true in relation to it's opposite.

I personally think that the second conception of gender binary is perhaps still flawed due to the assertion that masculinity and femininity should exist in opposition. However in the lives of most nonbinary people I see on here, the opposition seems very important in how they express their identity by trying to move towards androgyny. Personally when I think about gender binary in the second way I described, I believe that androgyny can exist wherever you decide to position yourself within the gender binary. Because in between two unattainable absolutes you'll always be a mix of gender. I think that people worry too much about what blend of features make one acceptably androgynous, but this acceptable androgyny seems to be situated at the midpoint of the traditional gender binary instead of where ever they decide their androgyny is.

2019-07-09 07:54:56,caxt7g,2,25,"As a nonbinary person, I always thought that performing and being like people with my assigned birth sex was some type of chore everyone did and I realized I never quite fit the game that society made me play. That was until I discovered transgender people and realized that all those disconnected thoughts to the concept of gender was really a form of social dysphoria, whether it's more physical or social is debatable. 

&amp;#x200B;

As someone who is panromantic, I feel my disconnection from the concept of gender helped me develop into a pan person. I never fell in love ""men"" and ""women"" and it was never that I actively looked for a man. As soon as I realized that I was able to like more than one gender was when the world finally felt a strange clarity where I finally felt things made sense but the rest of the world could never see it the way I do. I did not fall for my trans partner when she was still closeted and pretending to be male due to her masculinity. I was attracted to the way I could connect with her, see the stars in her eyes when we spoke, and trust her completely. 

&amp;#x200B;

As an asexual person, I am disconnected from society's connotation that sex=love. Sex was never something I truly desired. I have always been amused by it in theory and indifferent to it in real life. I've had sexually tense encounters with others where I felt completely uncomfortable. I have had sexual encounters where I felt safe and we were trusted. Either way, I never found connection there. I'm willing to do it for love within reason, but I never understood why people needed it to have a happy relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

2019-07-10 13:47:42,cbgx0f,0,2,"I've sort of passively accepted that I'm an alcoholic for years and that I do it to settle a deep discomfort within me at all times. Because of it I never grew into a functional adult (mid 20s') and my life and responsibilities have been in nothing short of chaos and turmoil.

I happened to realize what that discomfort is: I've always felt physically uncomfortable to the point where I don't sit, stand, or walk normally. My posture is tense and strained and my gait is visibly forced and awkward. I constantly squirm around to get comfortable. It's strikingly obvious and I get comments on it ALL THE TIME. Even my voice and laugh are strained and that's always bothered me. 

It's because I'm subconciously trying to present as feminine, all the time, when that isn't my nature. My brain is constantly trying to correct my body into sitting/standing like a lady, walking with a feminine gait, and speaking at a higher pitch than my natural voice. Not to mention how getting dressed is always, always a shitty experience for me. I have been wearing t-shirts and button downs for a few years now instead of girly things or fitted shirts, but I still get really really hung up on jeans. I hate having to carry a purse because it makes me feel ridiculous.

So now I'm going to allow myself to wear men's jeans instead of worrying about showing my female shape. I'm gonna carry a wallet in the back pocket because who says that's an exclusively male thing? it's convenient and logical. I haven't bought shoes in years and I really need to, so those are comming from the men's section too as I've always wished they could be. I'm going to let myself walk with the comfortably loose swagger as my body wants, and ""manspread"" or sit with a foot propped on a knee like I really want to. I'm going to stop feeling like I need to pop my chest out and suck in my stomach or keep my butt out/back perfectly straight. And I'm letting my voice come out as naturally deep as it is. I've been doing this at home and already feel like I've been realigned.

I'm not uncomfortable with being female per say, I do have body issues with my, uh, reproductive organs but I believe that is normal and comes from social pressure to have a perfect, tight, young appearance forever both down below and up top. But I'm not feminine in mannerism or personality and I have no interest in forcing it upon myself anymore.

I don't think I'm gonna bother telling anyone else about it. If they ask, I'll just say ""I'm not a feminine person and this is what's comfortable for me."" If they specifically ask of I'm NB/Trans then I'll probably answer honestly because I'm not ashamed and it doesn't really matter what others think. I was just imposing those rules on myself and now that I'm honest with myself I can finally heal and move forward in my life without the discomfort holding me back.

I also broke a bender that's been going on for months. A full day sober yesterday and still going strong today. I'm shaking like a leaf but my god does it feel good to not be buzzed up right now. I'm joining a gym beside my work and going to start lifting and getting in shape. It's nothing but fair weather ahead of me now.

I found this sub when I started seriously questioning whether I was asexual. I wanted, to try and put this in a way that doesn't sound rotten, to avoid being ""different."" I realized that was toxic. It was beautifully overwhelming to read all your stories that could have come straight from own mouth. It all clicked and fell into place.

Spilling through my own fingertips

2019-07-11 03:30:54,cbqpju,9,11,"I'm so confused about all of this that I'm struggling to even write this. I apologize it's going to be very scattered and disorganized.

I'm 29 afab and just this week it dawned on me that I might be nonbinary. Possibly demigirl? I'm so confused.

The biggest thing that's bothering me is that the realization hit me suddenly like a ton of bricks, rather than feeling anything ""off"" all along the way, like so many trans stories I hear. Because this is so sudden, I'm afraid it's not real and my feelings are made up. Also, my age. So many trans people are very young and here I am, almost 30, and just now going through this.


I've always felt comfortable with femininity. I *thought* I loved being a girl. But I've struggled with body image issues for a long time and it has gotten much worse recently, and I thought it was body dysmorphic disorder (with help from a therapist) and I'm not saying it isn't, but the idea that gender *dysphoria* thrown in to the equation makes SO MUCH SENSE. 
My reasoning is this. I finally decided to try out the mentality of being enby. Of not having a gender, or not caring about gender - just being a human with a body first and foremost. And I felt immediate relief. I felt so much weight lifted off my shoulders. I think part of the problem is also the ""woman"" box has become too small for me. The pressure to be a woman and feminine 100% of the time was causing so much of my body image troubles because when I tried on the ""enby persona trial"" (heh), I felt so...good! I had breasts and big wide hips. But it didn't feel bad anymore. it just felt like a body. An un-gendered human body. I was just myself, and I just so happened to have boobs. (But, even if I decide to embrace the nb identity, because my self esteem issues are so deep I'm sure that won't cure it all the way, but just even that much pressure lifted off was and is amazing.)

But I'm afraid. I love being girly. I just don't like being forced to feel like a woman. So I'm worried that I'm actually a cis woman who's too much of a coward to just be gender nonconforming and keep it that. But on the other hand.... the label nonbinary, and the feeling of not necessarily having a specific gender, just feels right. 

I also wouldn't feel comfortable changing my names or pronouns. Like...they/them just feels too strange for me. And I don't feel like a man, so he/him doesn't fit either. So then......an afab enby using she/her and not even changing her name is just a cis girl wanting to be a special snowflake, right?

More thoughts. If you're questioning any aspect of your identity, isn't there a good chance you're probably right? I mean, if you weren't seriously considering it, you probably aren't that thing. Right?

When I got a boy haircut 2 years ago, I felt so amazing. This short hair just feels right. I never want to change it. When I first got it, i looked in the mirror and thought, ""This makes me look androgynous. I love it."" Even though I am/was a girl. To this day, my hair is the only thing non-feminine about my appearance. I don't really know what else I could feasibly change - my breasts are way, way too large to bind comfortably (I'm assuming) and even then it would take too much effort, as someone who has severe depression and not enough energy to go around. Besides, I like the idea of keeping my breasts as they are, but reframing them in my mind as just a feature of my body rather than seeing them as gendered. They are there, on my genderless body, and that's okay. 

So if nothing changes except my gender label, that just can't be valid. That doesnt add up. When people come out a certain way, something about them changes. Pronouns, body parts, name, etc. So if I'm nonbinary but nothing changes, I'm just an imposter.

People who don't know me would probably laugh internally when they see me and find out I'm not a woman. ""There is nothing un-feminine about her, except her hair but even then she still looks girly. She even uses feminine pronouns. She's just a girl."" 

More random body thoughts. I really hate having a vagina, and I would prefer having a penis, but it's complicated. I don't want either. I just wish I didn't have any genitals at all.

I honestly just have been waiting for when I can go off to college and hopefully come out and get friends that I have more in common with but I still have all of my senior year of highschool left. \n\nBasically being queer has made me feel extremely isolated and dirty. I don't really have anyone to talk to and I know that I wouldn't be accepted by most people. If I could just be straight ans cis my life would be a hell of a lot more bearable but hey ig that just sucks for me :("", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Being queer kinda sucks?', 'created': 1562843658.0}"

Please excuse formatting, mobile ...

Please let me know if this needs to go somewhere else.

If any of the terms I use are offensive, I apologize in advance.  Let me know and I'll correct the issue.

I'm a 44 year old, biological male.  I've had a strong feminine side as far back as I can remember, like 10 or 12.  I've always had an interest in wearing women's clothing and make-up.  I've worn my hair long for most of my life.  I've always wanted to experience life as a woman.  

I came out to my wife a few years ago and she embraced it.  We have girls shopping afternoons.  We'll both get dressed up really nicely and cook a nice dinner and spend the evening having fun.  I'm still way not ready enough to head out in public en femme.

I don't want reassignment surgery and would likely only do minor facial enhancements, Adam's apple paring.

My family doesn't know about it, nor do my 11 and 12 year old kids, but they'd likely accept it as part of me and be supportive.

What I'm considering is beginning HRT and  possibly voice lessons and working on things that would help me be passable.  Then after a few months, when the effects start to show, get everyone together and let them in on it.

Anyone have any advice or words to the wise, tips and tricks, anything?  I looked all over the bookstore but couldn't find a strategy guide.

the effects of e that i like the sound of: 

* less body hair (body hair being my biggest current source of dysphoria)
* lower-body fat redistribution (my hips and ass, or rather the lack thereof, being close runner-up)
* no longer being absolutely petrified of one day balding
* softer skin and hair 

the effects i do Not like the sound of:

* upper-body fat redistribution (any breast growth whatsoever would def give me Bad dysphoria) 
* lowered libido

So I bit the bullet and bought a session for electrolysis. It's something that I've thought about doing for the longest time. I work in the beauty industry, and for most of my career I only felt comfortable covering up my beard shadow. I present more andro/femme most days, and my makeup has slowly graduated from Instagram style to muted. I don't want to feel the need to wear full coverage foundation when I already have really clear skin.
The only problem I have is that because I use much less makeup my beard area tends to show and makes me feel gross about myself. 
It makes me feel dirty and unkempt, and also makes me feel invalid in my own gender. I've been teetering back and forth for the longest time, whilst also finding other less permanent solutions, like waxing, or in one extreme case, literally plucking my entire beard area *ouch*
I've been hesitant because my (23) partner (29) of nearly 4 years (cis gay male) had questioned whether or not I will regret it when I'm older. He said he felt the same way when he was younger about facial hair but embraced his hair and fell in love with having a beard. His questioning makes me feel like maybe I'm making the wrong decision and I guess I just need support in that I know what I want and what I'm doing. I discussed the same thing with my sister, and she said it was akin to a tattoo. It's gonna be a permanent modification, but if you regret it later down the line, then so be it.

I have a tendency to really like feminine clothing at times, and I want to wear them and get a bit ""dolled up"". However, when I do this, I always end up feeling dysphoria. It's like I'm declaring,""I'M A GIRL AND I'M OKAY WITH IT."" But I'm not a girl and I'm not okay with being one. I've had it drilled into my head over and over again that the only way I'll ever be seen as attractive is if I dress femininely. I have to put on makeup. I have to wear this and that to look ""prettier (all things said by my mother) and so whenever I get dressed up, I feel like it's never for me. It's for everyone else to see that I'm a ""girl"" or something. I hate it. As a result of this, whenever I dress more masc, (since that's my default) I feel disgusting. But dressing more femme just makes me feel...wrong. Terribly, terribly wrong. I don't know if this makes any sense.

TL;DR: Dressing femme is something I lean to at times, (putting on makeup, blouses, dresses) but I get dysphoria and I simultaneously feel like I'm dressing for others. But dressing more masc also makes me feel disgusting. Essentially dressing one way or the other makes me feel like I'm putting on a show.

2019-07-12 20:42:36,ccgd1t,2,22,"So, I recently left my church due to a disagreement in how they expect people who experience gender related dysphoria to manage it.  I say ""gender related dysphoria"" because to me it is has a broader scope of things that it refers to.  So, I sent an email to my small group to let them know that I will not be there going forward and they should know what's up.  The email was regarding my name change and coming out as non-binary gender fluid and why I was leaving.  I have been doing my Enby thing for a few months already so the email just gave the story behind it.  

So, I have gotten a few responses and three of them are fully supportive and accepting of me.  One of them said we accept you and all that but won't embrace me as female or male and female.  So, only seen as male.  He didn't mention non-binary or gender fluid but his message was clear.  Two of them used my new name so I count them as positive reactions.  The third email response was a full screen wall of text.  It was the most supportive, encouraging, loving response I have ever received.  

However, I re-read things because I fear there might be hidden messages and then I read things into it that were never said or even intended.  So, I write a wall of text back.  She writes another wall of text to me.  Now, she is saying all the right things.  However, I am not good at having friends so I over analyze things because I tend to mis-interpret people a lot.  But she is speaking directly and sincerely and I am looking for hidden messages of ""I don't really accept you but feel I should say these things out of love"".

So, I took a step of faith and spilled all these thoughts I was having and I was trying to reject them as fast as they came.  I want to trust her that what she is saying is sincere and just not platitudes.  

And you know act happened.  She completely understood where I was coming from and why I was acting the way I was.  So, she responded with a third wall of text reassuring me that she is totally sincere in everything said and that she is a safe place to come to about things.  She also went the extra mile say that this amount of email in one day is abnormal frequency.  And that she will be gone for the rest of the month out of state camping.  Setting expectations so I would start worrying that I did something wrong or my brain doing its thing.  She is amazing.  I knew that already but her support of me in this just elevated the amount of amazing.  This is not a romantic type relationship at all.  I am not looking for that.  But, I can't believe that I actually have a friend that I can open my heart up and let whatever is there spill out.  

Like I said I am still processing this...  right now I am seriously reconsidering if I want to come back to this church when the small group starts up again just so I can see this friend on a regular basis.   But, I also want to attend a church where the pastors are not trying to convince me that I am wrong.  So I am torn.

Crouch down near the ground, afraid.

I'm a lil Frenchie who's been taking, leaving and taking up again the nonbinary label. The context in France is real different from what I gather it is in the US, trans issues are extremely rarely discussed and nonbinary identities are, well.... kind of just a meme. The French language has no neutral pronoun, every word is gendered so it's extremely hard to not gender yourself or someone else, and people are extremely adamant to correct you if you ""gender yourself wrong"". Moreover I'm AFAB, pretty chesty (I have a binder and it's great but far from flattening it all) and the only time people have been confused about my gender was when I had a buzzcut.... before they'd seen my face. In short: it's really hard for me to be seen as anything but a woman.

Leaving aside all consideration about what I ~feel~ inside (am I a woman? am I nonbinary? what does it all mean anyway?) I just kinda wanna be more androgynous and I don't know how to go about it. I don't even know if it's ""worth it"", part of me has given up and feels like I can never escape gender.

Moreover I\'m AFAB, pretty chesty (I have a binder and it\'s great but far from flattening it all) and the only time people have been confused about my gender was when I had a buzzcut.... before they\'d seen my face. In short: it\'s really hard for me to be seen as anything but a woman.\n\nLeaving aside all consideration about what I ~feel~ inside (am I a woman? am I nonbinary? what does it all mean anyway?) I just kinda wanna be more androgynous and I don\'t know how to go about it. I don\'t even know if it\'s ""worth it"", part of me has given up and feels like I can never escape gender. \n\nAnyone else feeling this way? Any advice is welcome.

Rocking a goth/industrial look was mentioned in a comment when I first posted, so here's an attempt.

It's been a good long while since I really did this look (masc)  and I never wore women's clothing then as far as I can recall.

Forgive my lack of proper accessories and the overall tameness.  To think, I just had my hands on my black straightjacket!  Oh well, I'm old, and moving, with anything from back in the day and most of my current kink-oriented stuff packed away.

To make up for it, I chose to include Vader's saber in some of the photos ...

I never had any real confusion until I was 14. I just didn't really know if I was totally female.

So, I'm MtF, in the early stages of hormones, but something happened last night that I've been thinking about a lot today. I noticed I often say on trans related subs ""I don't present feminine."" Or something to that effect. I realized last night that the way I present myself may not actually be as straight forward as I though. Other people may be picking up something different that what I thought I was displaying. Small things I started doing that make me feel better ended up being more than I realized. 

I realized that even though I've been saying that I present myself as male. I pain my nails. I shave my legs. I have long hair that I usually wear in a high pony tail. And I carry a purse. It's kind of a small messenger bag style almost, but you know what? It was marketed as a purse, and that's how I use it. 

Yesterday a friend and I went to another friends house. He lives in a that's pretty liberal. He lives in a college town with a much larger LGBT community than where I'm from, and he was part of some on campus LGBT thing, sorry I can't remember what it was. So he knows a lot of trans people. He lives about 150 miles away, but we drove up there after work because one of my favorite bands was playing there. 

So, I decided that I was going to come out to this friend. The friend I drove up there with already knew. So, when we get back to his place, I tell him, and he took it really well, as I expected. The first thing he did was asked my preferred pronouns. I told him that I prefer she/her or they/them. I've recently been considering going by they/them/theirs as kind of a transitionary thing. I know I hate masculine pronouns, and I know that I'm not ready for feminine pronouns. Then he asked if I was nonbinary or MtF. And then he told me that he thought I might be nonbinary before I came out to him. I realized that he never new me before I started picking up these habits, that I just totally forget about. I thought I was totally presenting masculine, but then ""Oh yeah, most people probably wouldn't consider these 'normal' things for a cis guy to do.

When I realized I was trans, I didn't know much. And all I ""knew"" was ""If I'm not a guy I guess I'm a gal"" All I knew was the gender binary. That was years ago though. I now understand that gender is a spectrum. But I've never gone back and thought, ""am I a woman?"" Until he told me that he thought I was nonbinary, I hadn't even thought about the possibility. After about 5 years of ""knowing"" I'm a trans women, here I am questioning my gender again. Or maybe it's just the pot talking. In the end, it doesn't really matter.

We are a group from Harvard Medical School creating a website intended to support gender diverse folks seeking information about the transition process. The online resources that currently exist for navigating the medical transition process are often confusing, inaccurate, or difficult to find. Our goal is to create an accessible, evidence-based, and centralized resource for people who are in the early stages of transitioning.

We want to ensure that this resource is created by queer folks and for queer folks, and we need your help!

Please take 5 minutes to fill out the following survey and share your thoughts on questions that should be addressed on this website. Your contributions will help us develop resources that will support gender diverse thinking about pursuing gender-affirming treatment!

I also want to ask if anyone who identifies more on one side of the gender spectrum but still as nonbinary would feel insecure about getting an F or M on their docs even if X is an option. I know it's ridiculous, but I have this scenario in my head where, in the future, people will use the fact that I didn't get an X as a way to gatekeep me from ""actually being nonbinary.""

2019-07-15 03:47:47,cdcii7,4,3,"CW: apparent humble bragging

I have a problem which others people may think is a nice problem to have. But it's creating a bit of an internal conflict: more people positively comment on my looks when I dress male conforming than when I dress fem.

Given that I'm quite fluid, some people make a big deal complimenting me when I dress masc after they see me dressed andro/fem for a while.

A second ""problem"" that I've mentioned before is that I don't have a ""taste"" for masc looks. I can't tell a handsome guy from an ugly one. And I can't tell which masc style looks good or not So I rely on other people's opinion. However, I have a strong taste for fem: I find fem cute and I can tell exactly what I like of each one.

In summary: I find masc clothes booring and I need to rely on others to see what looks good on me. I find fem clothes fun and I can tell when I feel cute.

However I'm used to be complimented and it sucks that outside this sub people only compliment me when masc.

Conflict: should I dress fem and feel cute trough my eyes even if I'm not complimented ? Should I dress masc and feel cute through other's eyes even if I don't see it?

External approval seems to weight a lot :(

How important is identity to you? Do you find identity to be overrated by society in general, hence all of the focus on binary, or to be undervalued, since so many people tend to ignore that more than 2 gender identities exist? Or do you think society should just let it go and let people just be, wear what they want, fuck who they want, all without labels in the end, as progress develops into the future (knowing that we aren't there yet since society is so focused on binary, so in the meantime identity may still be important)? 

A radical feminist (yes, radical, she informed me that the stereotype that radical feminist are women who want to eliminate men from the face of the earth is incorrect) told me recently that radical feminism, or at least some branches of it, state that gender is a social construct (with many varying biological components involving a lot of unknowns and correlations) and that those on the feminine end of the spectrum of gender will continue to be seen as lower class because of patriarchy. She said that essentially **patriarchy makes gender a class issue**, and this upper class/lower class/masculine/feminine is ingrained into our concept of gender itself, so therefore, we simply cannot overcome patriarchy without overcoming our concepts of gender. So the goal, she explained to me, of progress within radical feminism, is that people should accept that there could possibly be hundreds of genders within science, or at least certainly more than two, and as a result society should basically let gender go, and just no longer think of it as masculine/feminine. Of course, she doesn't expect people would stop being gay or straight or even cis, she said she doesn't expect gender expression to go away either and that everyone would start walking around in matching grey clothing, she told me she just thinks that people would be free in a way that is realistic to nature, respectful of each other, and that we probably can't even comprehend because it's so foreign to the way our society has functioned for practically ever.

2019-07-16 03:49:22,cdrxu5,1,4,"So today I got an email asking if my company's PR firm could interview me sometime this week about being a female boat captain. (They want to interview all the ‚ôÄÔ∏è captains, ""to see if there are potential story angles that we can share with local media."")

I can barely begin to describe how uncomfortable I feel.

I have a career trajectory that would make a decently interesting story, HOWEVER: 

1) I have always hated attention being directed at me just for achieving things while female.
2) I don't identify as female, but am not out at work to most ppl (including HR). I'm semi-out to my direct manager, but he's out of town this week. 

But I also really shouldn't refuse. I've been saying no to a bunch of sid at work lately due to burnout, and I just declined an interview a few weeks back b/c they wanted me to talk about a tour product I hadn't been on in 2 years, with a focus on the part of it I liked the least. Had a straight up panic over it before politely declining. But anyhow, I shouldn't keep saying no. 

I'm still trying to figure out a bunch of stuff w.r.t. my gender (am I NB or trans, what flavor of NB, what pronouns don't itch), which is why I'm not out (don't want to have to come out more than once), but I sure as heck don't want to be in the papers as ""one of &lt;company name&gt;'s female captains"".

So I've got to figure out how to handle this, and probably within the next 14 hours so I'm not rudely ignoring a work email. 

I feel so stuck! Either I've got to come out before I am at all ready, to our PR people AND HR (and possibly media if they still want my interview), or I've got to put a people-pleasing hat on and die inside during an interview that will further entrench the perception that I'm a gender that I'm not. What I really want to do is tell them that it's really freaking irritating that they are focusing on the gender of any of the captains and they should knock it off, but they want to collect on their inclusivity brownie points and I need to not bite the hand that feeds me and my excellent health insurance. 

How the heck do I handle this, fam? It feels like there's no right answer. I'd ask my manager, but he's nowhere near cell service, and I'd ask my therapist, but she's busy til my Friday appointment. What should I do?

So... I came out a few months ago as non-binary. My parents don't really get it but they are kinda supportive.

This weekend was the first pride walk ever in my hometown, so I decided to go with a mostly feminine appearance. I talked a bit with my mother, and she told me she remembered all the times I enjoyed wearing dresses and similar things as a kid (I have almost no memories of that), and it was very nice.

But then I asked her some help to put some nail polish, and she told me it was ""disturbing"". So I dug a little bit, and it seems that I can be feminine/androgynous only in a certain way or she won't like it.

Luckily she said hi during the walk and she didn't say anything about my (very) girly t-shirt (a present from my lovely girlfriend that I want to wear at every pride ever) and my heels. So I guess she's more cool than I feared, or she manages to hide it.

Now I'm almost 23 years old and came out in March as NB to my mom first although we talk maybe once a year and maybe a total of 6 times in the past nine years.

Anyways, I realized I wasn't cis about a year ago, and it's like everything just clicked. I originally came out to the internet, my husband, and two close friends as genderfluid, but I now just identify as nonbinary. I originally wasn't planning on really transitioning, but over the past six months or so my dysphoria has been getting drastically worse, and now I don't know what to do. Since I was 14, I've always presented very feminine and I thought I loved having a 34G bust, even though I was constantly experiencing depersonalization. Now I think I want to transition to be transmasc, but I'm scared of making the wrong decision, so ideally I'd like to try presenting masc more and more often to see if it feels right. 

The issue is that I can't pass without binding, and it's very risky for me to bind because of health conditions. I have fibromyalgia and Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disorder, which both cause chronic pain and severe heat intolerance, and my anti depressants make me very prone to heat exhaustion and heat stroke (it's 95¬∞F in OH currently), to the point that I only wear tank tops and shorts, and sometimes a thin hoodie in the below zero winters. I'm also autistic, so I have severe sensory overload issues as well, and can hardly tolerate a bra, and I can't stand t-shirts. Basically I'm constantly overheating on the verge of heat exhaustion, and I have sensory overload from most clothing üëç 

I have two binders that work well and are tolerable, but that doesn't matter much when it's too hot to safely bind. I'm just staying home all day, I rarely go out because I get dysphoria from presenting female, and I can't really present male until it cools down a lot. I'm starting to really think I want top surgery, not just for dysphoria reasons, but because I can hardly stand bras and my breasts make my fibromyalgia pain worse, but I'm worried I'd regret it and I'm scared of hurting my relationship with my parents. Like in my heart I know I'm not female, but I can't help but worry that somehow it'll completely change in the future and I'd want my breasts back, and I'm worried my husband might not be as attracted to me without them. He's bi, and he told me it wouldn't change anything, but anxiety is a b*tch. 

Sorry if this whole post is just a mess, but it's 5am and I can't think straight.

A couple months ago it was weighing on my mind a lot so I wound up coming out to my husband and a couple of friends as non-binary and gender fluid. it caused a lot of drama in my marriage but then my husband eventually became accepting of it. THEN I felt like I really wanted to change my name because mine is extremely feminine so I told my husband about that and it caused more drama but he eventually came around. I told my therapist about it so he suggested I could go by my new name in therapy and even though I felt so sure that it was what I wanted, once I actually started getting called by a new name it just felt weird and I changed my mind about it.

I know I still feel drastic shifts between femininity and masculinity, I'm scared of declaring a new label only to shift and feel uncomfortable with it.\n\n3. I'm afraid having a more specific label will cause more people, inside and outside of the community, to agrue with me that it doesn't exist (same problem I had with the genderfluid label) \n\nAny advice?"", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Questioning my gender', 'created': 1563459599.0}"

2019-07-18 11:59:54,cerk22,0,1,"my dad has always known that im nonbinary and tries to be as gender neutral with me as possible. however, he completely gave up on trying to use my pronouns (I've customized mines with one added neopronoun) and since he struggled, i told him he could just use they/them and he was better with that at first, but after some time he got sick of using those for me too so immediately defaulted me with he/him pronouns. i assumed maybe it's because my little brother is trans too, so by treating us both trans masculine it would help him a lot more.

im just gonna say right now that im straight up uncomfortable and dysphoric. im dysphoric in both binary genders and do not align myself. even if i do identify as a femandrogyne i still do not consider myself binary aligned. honestly, i hate even hate having to disclose my birth assignment as even that makes me feel invalid and that I'll never escape the gender binary and be androgynous enough (I can't fucking pass for the life of me) so....i did the worst thing finally by asking my dad whats going on

i asked him yesterday why does he ignore my pronouns for he/him and brought up that he even told the ambulance when i broke my ankle that i was female to male transgender (as he exactly worded it) he doesn't even remember that he did that, but he explained that he uses those pronouns for me because he just can't and never will understand what i mean when i say that im nonbinary.

he has a basic understanding of people who are like bigender for instance, but he doesn't think thats nonbinary. to him, binary means two meaning it's not about being one or the other, you are both of them. he denies having a binary gender himself because he doesn't have two genders. i was scared to tell him that im androgyne because while that would help him understand better, the talk about that stuff not truly being nonbinary, that i would have to be straight up agender made me feel really scared. i was scared that he'll end up taking and invalidating my identity away from me in that i express that it's not binary, meaning i am not one or the other.

i tried really really hard in explaining, i even asked if he's willing to go to gender workshops with me and he told me there's no point in doing that as he's tried to do his own research. he told me he'll accept me as whatever i am, but he can't and never will understand this. I'd be ok with that, but he also explained in depth how this stuff is made up and that this never existed until now. i tried to bring up the history of cultural genders and how colonization greatly effected that but then he started telling me that thats wrong, that native Americans even judged eachother if they were two spirit and had to get a shaman to bless them that they're sacred in order for them to be left alone.

the reason why i brought this up was because i thought talking about shamanism and spirituality would help him understand, it sounded like it's worked before. my dad is a brujo and told me he has to think in that mindset in order to grasp what im talking about. how souls tend to either be genderless or have all genders if they've been reincarnated enough. it helps knowing that he's tried even within that headspace, but to tell me that even that history is inaccurate and um..  he even told me that srs exists BECAUSE of colonization (like colonizers to him apparently forced indigenous people to be nonbinary through castration) it sounds REALLY REALLY BAD and im sorry if this triggers anyone especially poc. i know nonbinary was coined way later but the concept of genders outside the binary has always existed is what im getting at.

oddly enough, despite how he keeps bringing up that souls have no gender, he doesn't even believe in agender people. im not even agender but thats how he sees me when i say im nonbinary. he tells me im still valid, but he has no idea what it is or if its even real. he goes on that there's no scientific proof and all that bullshit even tho we've had genuine discussions about that including intersex people (not saying their bodies are agender unless they define it that way, but saying that sex isn't binary either) and talking about how gender is absolutely physical no matter what otherwise no one would pay hundreds and millions of dollars getting surgeries.

ok I WAS SO TIRED AT THIS POINT but what i wanna get to the bottom of this is that i think centrist politics is honestly rotting his brain. im sorry if any centrist person here will get offended by that, but he's getting so much toxic information from these political YouTube channels and research that of course he wouldn't understand this shit. centrists are always trying to be like ""im totally accepting and i think people should do whatever they want but ALSO these bigots are right about what they gotta say on minorities"" so......you know

just for your information im gonna immediately block and report if anyone tries to debate with me about the validity of neopronouns and shamanism. i have no patience for that shit as i know even this community can have the biggest bigots. im just really frustrated because i thought he totally accepted me but i feel like he doesn't. i flew all the way to another state thinking that im loved despite who i am, and he does still say that he loves me even tho im like this. but I'm hurt he told me the things he did and even turned down an opportunity to work on understanding my gender together by actually going to events. i think his harmful centrist views are preventing him from getting better and i never wanted to discuss politics to begin with, i just wanted to express to him that it hurts when he treats me transmasculine, im not my little brother and i want my identity to actually be valid without questioning its existance.",NonBinary,"i wonder if centrist politics prevent my dad in totally approving my gender (cw politics, spirituality, colonization, neopronouns)",1563476394.0,"{'created_utc': 1563451194, 'id': 'cerk22', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'my dad has always known that im nonbinary and tries to be as gender neutral with me as possible. however, he completely gave up on trying to use my pronouns (I\'ve customized mines with one added neopronoun) and since he struggled, i told him he could just use they/them and he was better with that at first, but after some time he got sick of using those for me too so immediately defaulted me with he/him pronouns. i assumed maybe it\'s because my little brother is trans too, so by treating us both trans masculine it would help him a lot more.\n\nim just gonna say right now that im straight up uncomfortable and dysphoric. im dysphoric in both binary genders and do not align myself. even if i do identify as a femandrogyne i still do not consider myself binary aligned. honestly, i hate even hate having to disclose my birth assignment as even that makes me feel invalid and that I\'ll never escape the gender binary and be androgynous enough (I can\'t fucking pass for the life of me) so....i did the worst thing finally by asking my dad whats going on\n\ni asked him yesterday why does he ignore my pronouns for he/him and brought up that he even told the ambulance when i broke my ankle that i was female to male transgender (as he exactly worded it) he doesn\'t even remember that he did that, but he explained that he uses those pronouns for me because he just can\'t and never will understand what i mean when i say that im nonbinary.\n\nhe has a basic understanding of people who are like bigender for instance, but he doesn\'t think thats nonbinary. to him, binary means two meaning it\'s not about being one or the other, you are both of them. he denies having a binary gender himself because he doesn\'t have two genders. i was scared to tell him that im androgyne because while that would help him understand better, the talk about that stuff not truly being nonbinary, that i would have to be straight up agender made me feel really scared. i was scared that he\'ll end up taking and invalidating my identity away from me in that i express that it\'s not binary, meaning i am not one or the other.\n\ni tried really really hard in explaining, i even asked if he\'s willing to go to gender workshops with me and he told me there\'s no point in doing that as he\'s tried to do his own research. he told me he\'ll accept me as whatever i am, but he can\'t and never will understand this.

The thing is that during the trip, out of nowhere, i felt really masculine and, most importantly, i felt comfortable with it. For the first time in my life. This is weird and interesting bc I'm AMAB.

-- 
Gender confusion started a long time ago, but the questions seemed innocent and angsty and so confused and nebulous, and they got locked up and pushed aside and repressed and went unanswered.  And then visiting /r/bi_irl turned into visiting /r/egg_irl and then I got hit by the gender identity confusion freight train.

I was already under considerable mental and emotional pressure from events and things happening around me over which I feel little control: work, home, relationship, family, parenthood, you name it.  I knew I was dangerously close to ‚Äòcracking up‚Äô psychologically.

I didn‚Äôt know even know that this egg was there, let alone that it was going to crack regardless of the inconvenience, repercussions or practicality of the matter.  But it did start to crack and I found inside of it the idea that I am non-binary.  Inside, I am not a one-gendered being.  The maleness I‚Äôve never been completely comfortable with could take a step back and leave room for what was once called my ‚Äúfeminine side‚Äù to exist.

In short, I could just be a person and not live in a prison defined by internalized gender roles and identities.  The ones that I let in and let take over because I had to just get things done and live my life.  And perhaps most importantly, the identities and roles I felt I needed to have in order to have relationships with my family members and in order to form relationships with the people around me.

I posted a photo here just 13 days ago ‚Ä¶ after having the courage to put on a woman‚Äôs top for the first time and realizing that I wanted to feel pretty and that it wasn‚Äôt just confusion going on inside and a process that I needed to do inside myself in order to ‚Äúresolve‚Äù the confusion and crisis of unearthing my non-binary nature.

Y‚Äôall have been super supportive and made me feel validated, praised me for being out there and recognized the confidence that I have had that this is not just some ‚Äúthing‚Äù going on but something embedded in my core.  You could see me and being seen, I could cry, am tearing up in fact already, that strangers on the internet did that.  They could see me.

I don‚Äôt want to be a stranger to you or to myself.  I want the strength of not being some stranger to be avoided and ignored by myself, by everyone, remaining unseen.

But confidence does not come without questioning, and bravery does not come without fear.  And the joy of discovery and setting out to new continents, uncharted ‚Ä¶ it does not hide or take away the sadness I hold inside, that you can see on most days behind my eyes.

Just 13 days after feeling so pretty and making that first post, and now it‚Äôs feeling too painful.  What I am asking my family to endure, the future unfolding that doesn‚Äôt feel like I can control anymore than I can control what came before ‚Ä¶

I went to a trans/gender identity support group last night for the first time.  My SO came along.  Near the end, a woman talked to me about the selfish nature of what is happening with me right now.  I know the situation from my struggles with mental illness, how selfish those diseases are and how damaging to relationships.

My SO has been supportive, although I know that she doesn‚Äôt really understand.  It turns out that it was selfish of me to have her come along to the group.  She was too tired to spend several hours there and to hear from me ‚Äúhormones are not out of the question‚Äù and whatever other things that I said that are scary to her, whatever things she heard from the trans women there that scared her ‚Ä¶ the fear that she is carrying that I‚Äôm not actually NB but am trans and just in the process of coming to terms with it.

I told her last night that I should ‚Äújust lock this back up‚Äù and she knew, it feels like she always knows even when it hurts so bad ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúyou have to figure this out now, because you can‚Äôt lock this up for another 5 years or whatever.  I need to know before I marry you and we buy a house and ...""

I want to tell my story but I want to know for myself what that story is more than anything.  And I wish it wasn't feeling so painful.

2019-07-21 21:31:17,cg4dkx,0,2,"Hello!

We are a group of researchers from Harvard Medical School and Boston Children‚Äôs hospital investigating transfeminine people‚Äôs experiences stopping estrogen prior to surgery.

The use of estrogen is thought to increase the risk of certain health complications (e.g. blood clots) both during and after surgery, but the evidence behind this is controversial. Many surgeons require patients on estrogen therapy to temporarily discontinue it prior to their procedure. However, little is known about the impact of this experience on patients, and consequently, there are no official guidelines in place regarding estrogen cessation prior to surgery.

If you‚Äôve experienced this before, we invite you to participate in an online focus group to share your thoughts. Your contributions could help us significantly improve the care of transfeminine people undergoing surgery!

**Please take 1 minute to fill out the following survey to check whether you are eligible:** [**http://j.mp/2KLK4k6**](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__j.mp_2KLK4k6&amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;c=WO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ&amp;r=__4EGmqb7ds3F-5hBbVLN3jW072tUMOX13V0z5zVmQU&amp;m=fIBRFypeDnoRE6Cpg6wtZNZmyiZxAND7VydIoPJd5KA&amp;s=niZ9HAL2cQBI3fzaelWhe0MQTOYUgpssowVfkEzL7T4&amp;e=)**.**

I'm AFAB and pursuing Top Surgery. I have a surgeon who's really nice and understanding of non-binary issues and I trust him a lot. But I'm having issues deciding between going with a full double mastectomy/Top Surgery or a breast reduction.

I haven't had sex in a few years now (due to sexual assault and a lot of trauma surrounding it), but when I get myself off sometimes I imagine using my breasts to stimulate a partner, or I get turned on by the idea of having them touched and used. I mean, but on the other hand sometimes I fantasize about being flat-chested, about being a cis dude, so.. I'm not sure.

I feel like it's silly to be so doubtful of this just because of my libido or whatever, because at the rate I'm going reaching intimacy with another person is a long ways off on my road to recovery.

I'm basically bald, like, right now I have a close buzz that still looks thinner on top than the sides. In terms of at least blending, that would make me stick out and I do not want to deal with wigs or caps if I'm going to be spending time at a pool. I want to feel free to go under if I want.

Now, that goes into my second thing, I'm AMAB. Kinda in-between body. I feel my shoulders are a little more broad and lack of breasts is pretty evident. Unless I wear something with heavily molded cups I actually feel fine though and don't feel too far separated from AFAB people who have flat chests. It's just that flat chest + bald head is adding up for things that don't raise flags if I'm wearing guy stuff but are definite flags if I'm in girl stuff.

First thing kinda combines with the second thing and the third thing combines with the second thing. Doing things non-linearly because wibbly wobbley, thready stuff...\n\nI'm basically bald, like, right now I have a close buzz that still looks thinner on top than the sides. In terms of at least blending, that would make me stick out and I do not want to deal with wigs or caps if I'm going to be spending time at a pool. I want to feel free to go under if I want.\n\nNow, that goes into my second thing, I'm AMAB. Kinda in-between body. I feel my shoulders are a little more broad and lack of breasts is pretty evident. Unless I wear something with heavily molded cups I actually feel fine though and don't feel too far separated from AFAB people who have flat chests. It's just that flat chest + bald head is adding up for things that don't raise flags if I'm wearing guy stuff but are definite flags if I'm in girl stuff.\n\nNow, I've never actually liked being topless. I'm not 100% but I think [something like this linked racerback style tank](https://www.target.com/p/women-s-racerback-tankini-clean-water-white-tropical/-/A-53846996) would work as a feminine cut but not necessarily throw up flags that stick around and actually look kinda cute.

2019-07-23 05:57:34,cgopa7,0,5,"Hello, this is my first time posting here, though I have been in this sub for what it feels like quite a long time now. Sorry if this post is too long, but I feel like I have no one to talk to about what follows next.

I live in Mexico, and in two weeks I will move out of my mom's house to attend university in another city. This is scary but mainly exciting, as now I will have the opportunity to truly be myself. I was AFAB, and thus I had always been forced to present as a woman, even though I would prefer a more androgynous look. I consider myself to be agender and though I do not experience much body dysphoria, I feel lots of social dysphoria. This led me to consider starting T as soon as I was able to, just to not be gendered female anyore. But now I am not sure if that would be something I would be comfortable with.

Recently I chose a new name for myself. I am kind of proud of it because I think it sounds gender neutral even if it is considered a ""boy's"" name and it has personal meaning. Only my closer friends and my partner, who is also non binary, know about it. They all have been great at respecting it, but it is hard to know that there are many people who know you by a name that makes you uncomfortable and, furthermore, my family calls me by my dead name because I have not disclosed my gender identity yet. I fear they would never understand. It was hard enough to have my mom find out I was not straight. 

Pronouns are hard for me. Spanish is a very gendered languaje. I try to avoid any pronouns or adjectives when talking about myself with people I am not out to, but of course they do not notice that and call me by female pronouns. For a year now, I have asked people I trust (close friends and my partner) to call me by neutral pronouns (""elle"" - invented by non binary and queer people who speak Spanish, but not recognized as official, as the language only takes into account the existence of two genders), and it makes me very happy when they use them for me. I also use them for myself when I am with them.

So I have been thinking of what to do at my new city. I will definitely start introducing myself by my real name, and I will look how can I get it legally changed as soon as possible (I'm 18). I do not know what to do about my gender marker - it can be changed, but only to ""male"" or ""female"". I would like to ask the teachers at universities to not call me by my dead name, but I am afraid to do so. I do not want to get in trouble, because I will depend on a full scholarship given by the school. Furthermore, what if I am not taken seriously because I look ""like a woman""?

And what to do about my pronouns? I feel anxious just thinking about being gendered female again by classmates, but I cannot see myself asking people who I do not trust to use neutral pronouns. At best, there will be a lot of questions and I will be asked to justify my identity. At worst, I will be actively discriminated against for ""trying to be special"" or for being queer. I am afraid.

I will cut my hair short, but I do not what style I should get. As a result of being forced to present in a feminine way, I feel anxious just getting near a hair-dresser. Too many bad memories. And looking through styles feels like a big impossible task - how will I know what will look good on me? 

I will start saving money to buy a binder. I would like to see a flat chest when I put on clothes. I do not know if I would like a top surgery though. I mean, I do not feel dysphoric about my chest but I would like to not notice (or have anyone notice) my boobs behind my shirts, if that makes sense. I will start buying more masculine clothes (though i know 0 about fashion). I will maybe start using make-up to make my face look more masculine, though I do not know if this is possible (and I have never used make-up before so I do not trust myself to achieve this). I would also love to train my voice to be more masculine, though I have no idea where to even start...

TL;DR: I will start living in a new city, I feel like this is my chance to live my inner truth as an agender person but I am also afraid and I do not know what to do about anything. 

I will appreciate any advice. Has any of you been in this situation before?

We share a lot around RPG fan spaces in general, but obviously (to me, a big nb nerd) a really important about the world we've built is that it's LGBT+ friendly and filled with a huge range of characters for whomst gender is No Big Thing.

The series explores a decaying, autumnal world and the enormous god husks that shape its regions. We follow two joined caravans, banded together by disaster; the displaced village of Ninut, and deserters of the Parish. It's kind of foklore-ish, slow paced and narrative heavy. We're working on writing up the rulebooks at the minute so people can have a go with them themselves!

I also don‚Äôt feel weird about my girlfriend describing herself as a lesbian, even though I don‚Äôt really think I consider myself a woman anymore. Maybe this depends on the person, but would other enbies take offense to my describing myself as a lesbian if I am attracted to them as well?\n\nI spent many years moving from fear of being a lesbian and hatred of that word to genuine love and pride. I love the lesbian community and I feel an intensely strong alignment with lesbians in a way that I don‚Äôt feel towards womanhood (not sure if that makes sense outside of my own head). I would never want to invalidate anyone else‚Äôs identity, but identifying as a lesbian is so important to me that I‚Äôm not sure what to think.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Question about identifying as a lesbian', 'created': 1564017050.0}"

&amp;#x200B;

I think it's important for all of us to consider our place in the trans community (which we are part of btw) and how are views can be harmful to those around us. I think we can all minimize our harm by educating ourselves on the trans community, our history, and what it means to be trans. Some basics things to get us started - mostly for those new to the community or still young:

&amp;#x200B;

* Trans does not mean transitioning. It means you don't identify as the same gender you were assigned at birth (agab) and as such all nb people are trans.
* On a similar point, you do not need to be medically, socially, or personally transitioning to be trans.
* Viewing people based on their genitals or agab is transphobia plain and simple. Same with discussing anything ""biological.""
* Nb encompasses a literal infinite amount of genders. If you don't feel masc, fem, or androgynous that's OK! There's more out. Our language is far behind the curve when it comes to gender and we don't have a lot of words to describe our feelings.
* On a similar note you can be gay or lesbian and still be attracted to someone whose nb. See point above if this confuses you.
* Black trans women literally built this community be thankful for them.
* Terfs are radical feminist who view trans women as men. They rhetoric is rooted is transmisogyny and as such are an enemy of the trans community.
* Trans meds are people who believe you must medically transition to be considered male. By and large they also believe you must have dsyphoria and they don't believe in the existence of nonbinary genders. Much of these beliefs are rooted in internalized transphobia. If you believe any of this please question why and who is benefiting from your gatekeeping (hint it's the cis).

honestly I just want to pick and choose things I like from both genders and just be me. although I would like to appear more masculine, have my voice deeper, jaw more defined. but at the end of the day when I‚Äôm laying in bed at night thinking about all this, my anxiety takes over and I fear that my feelings aren‚Äôt valid and that I‚Äôm wishing to feel this way instead of actually feeling this way.

If they leave the ovaries and fallopian tubes, I must not take HRT. Everything stays as is for now. But then I was asked if I‚Äôd like to have the ovaries and fallopian tubes be removed as well. I know that this would rid me of pelvic pain and traumatic medical procedures for good. This would be big for me. Common sense says to sign up for it.

However, I am in a bit of a unique situation. I am not FTM, I‚Äôm nonbinary. And if my ovaries are removed as well, the general recommendation is to take estrogen, as my body won‚Äôt produce it anymore. I don‚Äôt want to do that. I don‚Äôt want any more feminization. I never took T. I want to trial it. 

I asked four of my doctors and got four different opinions:

1) If I don‚Äôt take estrogen, my bones will become brittle and I will experience breaks. Osteoporosis will be inevitable. The mood swings of surgically induced menopause will be out of control, possibly making me depressed and suicidal. He does not prescribe progesterone. 

2) Elderly cis women who already are or went through menopause are often not prescribed HRT. They seem to be doing fine, but there is no data on younger people my age and no advice can be given.

3) Estrogen is the standard prescription. All the cis women patients take it post op and all the transmen patients take T, instead. Commit to one of them. Taking estrogen might have bigger risks than not taking it, though. If I take estrogen, I must take progesterone with it. Not supplementing that in conjunction with estrogen is ancient medicine. Pure estrogen heightens the risk of breast cancer, strokes, migraines and mood swings. If I wanted a mastectomy anway, we could talk about only taking estrogen.

4) Leave the ovaries intact to avoid this discussion and be happy with the absence of my uterus and periods.  Transmen and nonbinary people alike have to toughen up and see gynecologists on a regular basis, no matter the dysphoria or trauma. 

While I appreciate their responses, I still have no idea what is actually true and best for me.

2019-07-27 04:17:54,cid1jf,8,37,"So, I went to my appointment at Planned Parenthood in Ventura, Ca. I'd like to preface this with the fact that I think that they are an absolutely amazing organization. They are an absolute ally of the community and I wish them no ill will at all. This was my experience at one center that had just started doing HRT and based on my experience, they didn't have the proper training to handle HRT for a Non-Binary person.

I had spoken with the GNC specialist who said that I should be able to leave with a prescription the day of my appointment.  I had also verified ahead of time that I would be able to get a prescription for a DHT blocker which I want to use to limit body hair growth and bottom growth (it also does help to prevent head hair loss but that is not why I had requested it). They would start me on informed consent, then I could continue there or switch to someone else to monitor my care. I was explicitly told by the GNC specialist that these details would all be put in my chart and none of it should be a problem in theory.

Check-in went perfectly, they used my preferred name and didn't misgender me or assume anything about me. I went back into the room alone and someone interviewed me. It was the same questions the GNC specialist had asked me which is good to do in case people couldn't be honest on the phone for some reason. While being interviewed I disclosed that I had not had an STD test before (I've just never been with anyone I've had to worry about that with so I haven't done it. I am aware I should still get tested). I told her that I would deal with that at a later visit as I had not mentally prepared and she was fine. She went out to get my partner from the waiting room and I'm really glad I had him in there because that's where everything took a weird/bad turn.

The nurse practitioner came in and basically flat out said that it was against protocol to give DHT blockers and T at the same time. She also flat out told me they don't prescribe gel even though the GNC specialist had also said that they could prescribe it but my insurance my not cover it. When I brought up that I had already verified that I should be able to get it she started going on and on about hair loss and why I shouldn't be scared of it. I insisted through all of it that I wasn't concerned about hair loss and I had done a lot of research (not just Reddit, I mean looking at a lot of  well thought of patient guides and studies over a series of months) that indicated that it minimized bottom growth and body hair growth as well as possibly some voice drop. This was absolutely disregarded and she flat out told me that DHT blockers cancel out the effects of T completely and there was no point of taking them together. (Just plain wrong). She insisted that she had talked to a doctor about it before my appointment and they would refuse to prescribe them at the same time because of it but I pointed out to her that the situation is obviously different because I am not a trans man, I am in fact non-binary, and maybe the doctor hadn't been told that. Through all of this, I had openly and repeatedly stated that I know that you can not pick and chose the effects you get but that this is the only combination I was comfortable with because the symptoms that I was listing were permanent and especially bottom growth could happen fairly quickly so I wanted to do everything I could to minimize it.

So, she left the room to supposedly call the doctor ""up in Ojai"". (That's where I live btw and no mention the entire visit of this doctor's name.) When she got back she implied that she had talked it over with the doctor and then just tried to divert the situation away from it completely by saying that T would have ""effects on my liver and blood"" (which from my research the liver thing seems to only be for when you take it in pill form). I told her that I fully knew it had effects that came with risks and I was willing to take them but only if I could do it with a DHT blocker and that if I couldn't do that I wasn't interested in taking hormones from them at all. This was all through the informed consent system. I wrongly assumed that meant that I would be informed of the risks of what I wanted to do, sign a form, and get a prescription and take any liability for what happened onto myself. She just said that she couldn't guarantee my effects (never asked her to) and basically refused again when I asked to even consider the situation a bit more from the perspective that I am not a man and may have different goals than she's used to. (And even if I was a trans man who was concerned about hair loss I should still have been able to sign the forms and get the care I needed through the informed consent model).

She then continued to try and divert me by saying that it was a No-No to get pregnant while on T. I said that was fine and I had already received info on getting a copper IUD. She asked if I wanted to get that today and I said that I was not mentally prepared and would be looking into it at a later date. She continued to try to convince me to get it that day saying that I should focus on that before T. Part of her tactic to try and get me to get one today was to tell me ""it doesn't matter how tight you are, I've put IUD's into 14-year-old virgins, I can get one in you."" What. The. Fuck. was the only thing that I or my partner could think. At that point, I knew I'd be leaving and wouldn't be coming back.

She had absolutely no concept that the reason that I wasn't ok with doing an STD test or an IUD that day. Even though I don't have the worst dysphoria down there I have enough that I can't do stuff like that without a LOT of mental preparation and between the reason for my visit and my pronoun pin coupled with the fact that I had already said I wasn't prepared for that today,  I figured she would understand that that was why I wasn't ok with it and drop it.

I shut things down pretty quickly after that and simply asked if she had any recommendations on where I could get better GNC care. She vaguely said that she had heard of some places in Santa Monica and I was asked one final time if I was doing T or not. I said no and she lead us out.

There was obviously a huge disconnect in whatever was happening there and it made me feel completely erased as a non-binary person. I'm fairly certain they didn't see beyond ""FTM who doesn't wanna go bald"" when it came to the actual hormones and I could see there was no way fix that. I had to say repeatedly during my appointment ""but I'm not a trans man"" because she was assuming I wanted or didn't want certain things based on the fact that I was trying to get on T.

I don't know if this is typical. I don't know if it was just this one person. I can't say for sure that anyone else would have an experience like this. But I wanted to share because if I had known this could happen it would have tempered my expectations today that had been given to me by the GNC specialist (who I will be speaking to first thing Monday about my experience to figure out if he has no clue what he's talking about or if the nurse practitioner was assuming too much and not being flexible enough to even talk to me). You can still go there. Other clinics that have been doing this longer may have more experience and you may have a totally positive experience. But beware, just because an organization is friendly doesn't mean that the path is easy for us.

On a more positive note, my new health insurance kicks in next Thursday and I should be able to go see an actual endocrinologist soon who will be more skilled to take care of my particular situation.

It was the same questions the GNC specialist had asked me which is good to do in case people couldn\'t be honest on the phone for some reason. While being interviewed I disclosed that I had not had an STD test before (I\'ve just never been with anyone I\'ve had to worry about that with so I haven\'t done it. I am aware I should still get tested). I told her that I would deal with that at a later visit as I had not mentally prepared and she was fine. She went out to get my partner from the waiting room and I\'m really glad I had him in there because that\'s where everything took a weird/bad turn.\n\nThe nurse practitioner came in and basically flat out said that it was against protocol to give DHT blockers and T at the same time. She also flat out told me they don\'t prescribe gel even though the GNC specialist had also said that they could prescribe it but my insurance my not cover it. When I brought up that I had already verified that I should be able to get it she started going on and on about hair loss and why I shouldn\'t be scared of it. I insisted through all of it that I wasn\'t concerned about hair loss and I had done a lot of research (not just Reddit, I mean looking at a lot of  well thought of patient guides and studies over a series of months) that indicated that it minimized bottom growth and body hair growth as well as possibly some voice drop. This was absolutely disregarded and she flat out told me that DHT blockers cancel out the effects of T completely and there was no point of taking them together. (Just plain wrong). She insisted that she had talked to a doctor about it before my appointment and they would refuse to prescribe them at the same time because of it but I pointed out to her that the situation is obviously different because I am not a trans man, I am in fact non-binary, and maybe the doctor hadn\'t been told that. Through all of this, I had openly and repeatedly stated that I know that you can not pick and chose the effects you get but that this is the only combination I was comfortable with because the symptoms that I was listing were permanent and especially bottom growth could happen fairly quickly so I wanted to do everything I could to minimize it.\n\nSo, she left the room to supposedly call the doctor ""up in Ojai"". (That\'s where I live btw and no mention the entire visit of this doctor\'s name.) When she got back she implied that she had talked it over with the doctor and then just tried to divert the situation away from it completely by saying that T would have ""effects on my liver and blood"" (which from my research the liver thing seems to only be for when you take it in pill form). I told her that I fully knew it had effects that came with risks and I was willing to take them but only if I could do it with a DHT blocker and that if I couldn\'t do that I wasn\'t interested in taking hormones from them at all. This was all through the informed consent system. I wrongly assumed that meant that I would be informed of the risks of what I wanted to do, sign a form, and get a prescription and take any liability for what happened onto myself. She just said that she couldn\'t guarantee my effects (never asked her to) and basically refused again when I asked to even consider the situation a bit more from the perspective that I am not a man and may have different goals than she\'s used to. (And even if I was a trans man who was concerned about hair loss I should still have been able to sign the forms and get the care I needed through the informed consent model).\n\nShe then continued to try and divert me by saying that it was a No-No to get pregnant while on T. I said that was fine and I had already received info on getting a copper IUD. She asked if I wanted to get that today and I said that I was not mentally prepared and would be looking into it at a later date. She continued to try to convince me to get it that day saying that I should focus on that before T. Part of her tactic to try and get me to get one today was to tell me ""it doesn\'t matter how tight you are, I\'ve put IUD\'s into 14-year-old virgins, I can get one in you."" What. The. Fuck. was the only thing that I or my partner could think. At that point, I knew I\'d be leaving and wouldn\'t be coming back.\n\nShe had absolutely no concept that the reason that I wasn\'t ok with doing an STD test or an IUD that day. Even though I don\'t have the worst dysphoria down there I have enough that I can\'t do stuff like that without a LOT of mental preparation and between the reason for my visit and my pronoun pin coupled with the fact that I had already said I wasn\'t prepared for that today,  I figured she would understand that that was why I wasn\'t ok with it and drop it.\n\nI shut things down pretty quickly after that and simply asked if she had any recommendations on where I could get better GNC care. She vaguely said that she had heard of some places in Santa Monica and I was asked one final time if I was doing T or not. I said no and she lead us out.\n\nThere was obviously a huge disconnect in whatever was happening there and it made me feel completely erased as a non-binary person. I\'m fairly certain they didn\'t see beyond ""FTM who doesn\'t wanna go bald"" when it came to the actual hormones and I could see there was no way fix that. I had to say repeatedly during my appointment ""but I\'m not a trans man"" because she was assuming I wanted or didn\'t want certain things based on the fact that I was trying to get on T.\n\nI don\'t know if this is typical. I don\'t know if it was just this one person. I can\'t say for sure that anyone else would have an experience like this. But I wanted to share because if I had known this could happen it would have tempered my expectations today that had been given to me by the GNC specialist (who I will be speaking to first thing Monday about my experience to figure out if he has no clue what he\'s talking about or if the nurse practitioner was assuming too much and not being flexible enough to even talk to me). You can still go there. Other clinics that have been doing this longer may have more experience and you may have a totally positive experience. But beware, just because an organization is friendly doesn\'t mean that the path is easy for us.\n\nOn a more positive note, my new health insurance kicks in next Thursday and I should be able to go see an actual endocrinologist soon who will be more skilled to take care of my particular situation.\n\nTLDR: Don\'t get your hopes up for good non-binary care at a Planned Parenthood.

Hey everyone, forgive my ignorance in advance, I was hoping we could launch a discussion on this topic. As a rather old cis person, up until recently I just addressed people based on their external appearance. It has always been considerably easy for me to figure out if I should address someone as ''Miss/she/her'' or ''Mister/he/him''. However, as I take an interest in gender diversity, I realise that people's external appearance doesn't always determine who they are inside and I know that addressing them by the wrong gender pronoun can be upsetting. Old-fashioned me then thought she'd just keep calling people Miss/Mister if they appeared to be cis, and to politely inquire how they prefer to be called if the person looks androgynous. However, I have read great articles on the subject that note that not all non-binary people are necessarily androgynous, meaning literally anyone you see could identify as non-binary.

To summarize, imagine girl is red and boy is blue.

Then some people are green (a masc genderqueer maybe?) or orange (a femme enby?), some people are white (all the colors/genders) and some are black (agender), and some are many colors at the same time!!

A few questions to start things off (answer any, all or none!):

* Where/when do you feel safe presenting in a gender-nonconforming way? Where/when do you feel unsafe?
* Have you ever experienced harassment/discrimination/assault because of the way you present?
* Do you take any specific safety precautions when presenting in a gender-nonconforming way?
* Do you ever deliberately try to ""pass"" as having a binary presentation?

I know this stuff is difficult to talk about, but to my mind it's a lot better to be open about it, where we can reassure/advise/comfort each other, than to have all of us living with our own private fears and doubts.

2019-07-30 06:50:46,cjnyzz,2,9,"(Again, trigger warning for talking about periods, fertility, having babies, etc.)

Okay I'll just start of by saying this going to be kind of a stupid post, because I don't even really know what I'm asking, but hear me out.

When I started transitioning I thought I was FTM. Puberty was pretty traumatic for me and I hated everything to do with it. But after I started T, that all started to calm down and I started to accept my feminine side more. Which made me realize I was actually non-binary. I'm still leaning a bit more to the male side though. My name and gender marker is male and I look 100% male . On rare occasions I polish my nails (but usually not when I'm planning on going out), but outside from that there isn't anything noticeable from the outside that would make anyone think I'm anything but a man. Most people don't even know that I'm trans.

The thing is, a while ago I quite suddenly started having the urge to have children (really as the mother). Since this has been consistent for quit some months, I am pretty sure this feeling won't just go away. Before I was pretty neutral on the subject of having children. And I didn't really have any long-term plans on what to with my live. I am not ambitious about work and I don't want to travel the world or things like that. But since this feeling started it really feels like the pieces have fallen together. Like that is what I want to do with my life, have a bunch of children. Be a stay-at-home mom (at least while they are still children). Like if I died right now, not ever having been able to have children would be my one regret. 

Which is why I am concerned about my fertility. There is very little knowledge about what effect T has on fertility (after stopping). There have been FTM's who have gotten pregnant and had a healthy baby even after being 10 years on T. But there is no record of how many have tried for children but where unable to. And I think for something that is this important to me, I shouldn't risk it, right?

Being on T isn't a very high necessity for me anymore. All the changes have already happened. The only concern would be the reversible changes. Which would basically just be fat redistribution and muscle mass ^(^and ^orgasming, ^cough, ^cough.) 

Fat distribution won't make much difference for me, because I never really noticed a difference there in the first place (my body shape was already pretty androgynous, I think). Muscle mass would be a downer though. Because I really like the way that is now. I have so much more strength (and I really didn't do anything to get it). I'm also a bit worried about the latter one, because honestly I really hated masturbating before. And I'm not sure if its the accepting my femininity or the T that has changed that. And I'm worried of losing what I have now. I have also finally just started losing weight in the past few months (which is a huge thing for me, has basically never happened to me before and is much needed). So I'm also worried that I mess that up if I stop now, since woman gain weight more easily. And the last thing I'm worried about is my beard. I basically have a full-beard, but I have just a few spots that still need filling. And I'm worried that if I stop T now, that they'll never properly fill in. 

I'm also really not in a position to have children right now. I am not even seeing anyone. So I think it will be 2 more years at the very least before I even start trying. I'm really hoping to have my first child in less than 5 five years from now. Although I'm not sure how realistic that is.

So with all these things I would say that maybe the timing isn't right and I would be better off waiting a little longer. But the reason I don't want to wait is because I'm worried that if I keep going, it will damage my fertility. I'm especially worried that this sudden urge to have children is a sign I am going infertile. I haven't had my fertility tested, and honestly I am not going to because I don't want to go through that process. But again, if I want to have children so badly (and yes I really want them to be mine, so not by adoption), should I really put that at risk for those rather trivial things?

I take my T shots every 3 months, and my next shot was suppose to be 3 days ago so I don't have much time left to decide (being a few days late isn't a big deal). I've been trying to decide for the last 3 months but I haven't gotten any further in making a decision. Which is why I am writing this post. I was thinking of maybe stopping for a while to see if I am at least still able to get my period (I already got my period only once and never again when I switched from birth control to T, but that's probably because I was on birth control for so long. So I think it will take more than 3 months at the very least to get one again). But I think that once I do get my period, I'll still have the very same question on whether I should start again now or stay off. So I still would really like some advice.

I realize its probably mostly ""newbies"" here who are questioning if they are non-binary or just starting out with transitioning, and not a lot of people with a similar situation to mine. But I was just really hoping to get someone else's thoughts on this. Doesn't necessarily have to be an answer. Just any thoughts at all, please.",NonBinary,"Stopping T, yes or no?

2019-07-31 03:19:52,ck2odl,0,9,"Heya~!

I wanted to wait a little bit before doing this because I just recently came out as trans to a few of my friends, and haven't yet come up with what I wanted to change my name to.

But after a lot of thinking, I think I've come up with something that I really like~

So hey guys, gals, and everything inbetween~ My name is Rea!

I'm 17 years old, I'm transgender MtF, and I am still mostly in the closet about both my gender, as well as my sexuality. (I'm bi~)

I am also an artist, and I'm planning on going to college for art sometime next year.

Anyway, on with my story.

So I didn't start to realize that something was posibly wrong with me until around 12 or 13, when I hit puberty. Everything that was happening just felt wrong to me, but I didn't quite understand why. I just assumed that ""this was a puberty thing,"" and probably everyone felt like this when it first starts happening.

Turns out though, that I was wrong.

Oh so very very wrong.

I didn't really know what to do about this at the time, so I kinda just ignored it, while at the same time absolutely hating literally every single part about my body. I mean who could blame me, I didn't even know what ""transgender"" was at the time.

it wasn't until a few years later, (last year to be exact) when I came across this youtube video that someone posted talking about their experience with growing up trans. Feeling bored, and having nothing else to watch, I decided to give it a click.

And watching it made me relate to them more than I think anything else ever had.

Immediately, I started doing a bit of research, looking up other people's experience, looking up different gender identities that I might actually be, and after thinking about it for a little bit, I started dobubting myself (which is something that I always do) and went back to just being a depressed cis guy, with no idea why he felt so terrible about the way he looked.

Over time, the thought of being trans came back to me, so for a while I decided to just go as non-binary, but that still felt wrong to me. During this time, I went to a 2 week summer camp, away from my siblings, my parents, and for the first time in my life, I opened up to people.

(and my ""opening up,"" I mean I told people I was bi, but I stayed quiet about being trans.)

Everytime I was called a guy I hated myself for not correcting them. But even then, I still had an amazing time at this camp, I made some really great friends, (two of which being trans themselves,) and after the camp ended, I messaged them on Instagram telling them the truth about my gender.

And obviously, (there wasn't even a question about it,) they were all extremely accepting.

they've been super supportive, and they even helped me come up with my new name. And so far, that's where my story ends.

I haven't come out to my family yet, but it's something that I really want to try and do before the end of this summer. And I really do hope that my family is just as accepting as my friends have been.",NonBinary,A greetings to all~ + my story (so far) üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà,1564568392.0,"{'created_utc': 1564543192, 'id': 'ck2odl', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 9, 'selftext': 'Heya~!\n\nI wanted to wait a little bit before doing this because I just recently came out as trans to a few of my friends, and haven\'t yet come up with what I wanted to change my name to.\n\nBut after a lot of thinking, I think I\'ve come up with something that I really like~\n\nSo hey guys, gals, and everything inbetween~ My name is Rea!\n\nI\'m 17 years old, I\'m transgender MtF, and I am still mostly in the closet about both my gender, as well as my sexuality.

Well, lovelies, I posted last week about my intent to come out to my parents as enby (24 AFAB, they/them) during my visit. Here's the promised update: 

I came out to my mother early on in the week when she began talking unprompted about her struggles to use the singular ""they"" because grammar. I thought giving her a personal reason to try might help. She said all the right things in the moment, but made a real meal of the ""well, I might forget because I'm only human but it doesn't mean I'm transphobic, etc."" I was anticipating that. 

Then... she spent the rest of the week misgendering me dozens of times. Frankly, I don't know that she'd ever referenced my gender that much when she thought I was cis. The one time I (gently) corrected her, she had a whole meltdown about how she was trying and she warned me she'd mess up and... yeah. Basically, it was all about her and her feelings and I was a jerk for imposing this on her. 

I never got the chance to come out to my Dad. While I really think he would do (and want to do) better, and while in a lot of ways he would have been the easier parent, the whole thing with my mother really took the wind out of my sails. She has a long history of abusing and erasing my lived experience, and it was hard not to go back to those feelings.

Sadness that the NB friend whose coming out tipped the balance for me in the first place also prefers me to present my assigned gender.

Mourning losing the gender I never really had while at the same time deciding how much I want to perform it.

Feeling conflicted around my girlfriend not only for her preferences but for envying her more masculine personality, her ability to stay friends with guys.

Wanting to apologise for my near blanket preference towards guys, but also knowing it goes nowhere, and the preference is meaningless. I'm asexual. Being asexual meant I never made myself work through how I feel about women until now - I knew I didn't want to have sex with them, so I went through my life assuming straight. When that failed it all fell apart. I've fancied women but felt I could never try it with a woman, as disappointing a minority that already have it rough just seemed too much. Plus friendship was so nice. And no sex automatically, because they were women. It was nice to have a whole group 'written off' the sexual/relationship worry radar, problematic as that is.

Looking in the mirror and saying I feel like a gay guy and feeling utterly ridiculous and then closing my eyes and seeing the gay guy in my head saying I'm a straight woman also look ridiculous.

Knowing that my ideal body type is male ballerina but that on me that would look like butch woman. Even if I was effeminate dressing on top of a butch body type.

Wanting the opposite sex's body but not having the 'right' socialisation skills or preferences to go with it. And never wanting it 'enough', anyway.

Wondering if it would make sense to be a gay dude forever internally without any outward transition and if that is more or less insane sounding than saying I'm cis.

Maybe achieving something near to total androgyny would be perfection. Or maybe it would be just enough.

Or maybe I just have issues with being a lesbian and or a woman.

If I just want to please others above trying to be whatever it is I even am, then all I have to do is do nothing. Default cis. Default cis. Default cis.
