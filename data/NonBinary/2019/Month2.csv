The kids did the class on gender identy today and my 10 year old sister got up and talked about me and my transition in front of her whole class 😭

Flash forward to later that day when one of the kids in her class came running up to my dad in the parking lot as he was picking the kids up and asked ""is it true that your daughter is neutral?"" 

Thats when the youngest of my siblings, an 8 y/o, responded ""THEYRE NOT NEUTERED MY SIBLING ISNT A DOG"" 🤣 

My dad had to gently tell my sister that neuter was different from neutral, then tell the kid that I'm a sibling not a daughter.

Please don't read if this will trigger, discomfort or otherwise upset you.** If you can't read below that's entirely valid and I hope you have a nice night!

Let me describe who I am as a disclaimer for my experiences: I am an AMAB, agender, 'white working class' 21 year old. I am a victim of sexual assault (both recent and from childhood) and the victim of abuse at the hands of three individual trans men. I understand my experiences are not entirely unique, and that I benefit vastly from appearing as a ""guy"" in my day-to-day life (much more so from being a white one) but I have suffered greatly from it. In my personal life I have been actively discouraged from defending myself in abusive situations at the hands of a trans man, I have been told that because of my assigned gender my consent is a ""grey area"". I have been told that if an abuser is hitting me and spitting in my face and I hit him back and leave the room that makes me the abuser. I have been gaslighted (gaslit?? jfc what is the past tense of this), manipulated and intentionally triggered and because of my stature those facts have been ignored and my reactions have been scrutinised. 

I have been permanently discouraged from existing in NB spaces for appearing too masculine, not intentionally but just because I like to wear what's comfortable. I have been excluded from social situations *exclusively for being AMAB*. When I wake up and get on Reddit and see an entire post being upvoted into the stratosphere about how we need to discuss abuse against trans men I say ""Oh okay! This should be productive."" and despite my history I feel 0 discomfort in opening the post hoping to see abuse statistics being discussed critically. Personally I think all statistics should be held under the absolute harshest gaze and picked apart, statistics aren't just numbers and the sociopolitical factors deciding the numbers portion of abuse statistics are more important than the numbers themselves. So when I see people saying ""Trans men need to be considered and cared for in reports of abuse against trans people"" and that the social factors of their perceived benefits rely on them being on HRT, passing, hetero presenting etc, I go ""Yes good this is what I wanted"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Then when I scroll down and all I see are men demanding to be the *only* attended to party in articles, and I see them *demanding* attention, and I see them talking about how they *deserve* to be completely separated from the abuse statistics all trans people face. And then I see someone mention wanting to see more NB representation in those statistics just to be piled on by some asshole talking about how ""CAN'T TRANS MEN JUST HAVE AN ENTIRE ARTICLE TO THEMSELVES"" I am fucking ***baffled***. Why is ANYBODY deserving of having their abuse paid attention to more than anyone else?? What puts anybody in the position to say they deserve an entire article dedicated to them within the umbrella of abuse that trans people face? This is fucking mindboggling but it's also *infuriating*. The sheer resentment you must feel towards anyone that isn't exactly like you to respond to ""I'd like to see other groups besides trans women represented as well more often"" by accusing that person of *derailing the topic* is borderline xenophobic. It's hating the *other*, it's hating the people who aren't like *you*. 

I can't fucking believe that there is such a distinct lack of solidarity in so many queer spaces, that gatekeeping and the need for sameness is so fucking pervasive that we would happily accuse equally marginalised groups of ""derailing topics"" by wanting to be seen. I absolutely cannot believe that and it reeks of the exact MRA bullshit that cishet 'redpillers' do all the fucking time. At a certain point you aren't interested in having your issues paid attention to, you're focused on having you *identity* paid attention to. You're demanding an excess of space and attention in a capacity that other groups are even more excluded from. That's nothing but hubris--it's pride and it's selfishness. More importantly it's anything but productive, and that NB people have to struggle so fucking greatly for any attention or respect in general let alone from ***other trans people*** is revolting. Nobody. **Nobody** is above being abused. And nobody's abuse is less valid or important than anyone else's. That people are incapable of seeing the struggle they share with one another is the most genuinely demoralising experience I've had recently and it shows me that we're still so far from establishing mutual respect among all trans identities.

2019-02-04 19:32:57,an5aoy,5,1,"The past week, I've been thinking about my gender a lot, reflecting on how I've talked about it over time, and I'm wondering if I may be more agender than previously identified.

My whole life, my gender has just been a reflection of other people's expectations based on my physical characteristics, a path of least resistance most of the time, except when I get hurt or helpless or angry and fight it. I ended up female by default, and I'm okay with it, because it's what I know, but I also don't feel like it's MINE. I've always wanted my gender to be irrelevant, and I thought for a long time that was simply due to misogyny and toxic gender roles, but now I'm wondering if maybe it's more than that or ... less.

My sister has three kids, 2 AFAB and 1 AMAB, and one of the most important things in my life is stripping out as much of the toxic, backwards ideas they get about gender from media (and my mother) as possible. They see that Auntie is physically strong, financially independent, fun as hell, and unlimited. In their eyes, I'm a woman, and that's okay; I think I add more value to their development that way, at least for now. To my heterosexual boyfriend, I'm a girlfriend, and that's okay; it doesn't bother me to be that, because it's just a label that doesn't inform our dynamic at all. Being a sister is also okay with me. Being a daughter is ... less okay, now that I think about it, because the gender damage that was done to me was done during my development at the hands of my mother (my father, who was my primary caregiver for the vast majority of my childhood, has always been wonderful, and I armchair read him as asexual/aromantic, and I don't think he would have parented an AMAB child much differently).

My gender isn't important to me, but if it's important to someone else *for reasons that don't hurt me*, I can be a woman for them without discomfort. I could not similarly be a man, because that's NOT familiar to me, I don't identify with it in any way, and it would feel disingenuous and appropriative. My gender is still, I guess, to this day something that belongs primarily to or is informed by the people around me. I use female pronouns because I always have, they don't bother me, and they're easy. Depending on the day and the form, I'll either tick the female box or the prefer not to say box. I live my life presenting female and IDing as a woman, but if you ask me my gender, the feeling I get deep down inside is: don't know, don't care, question irrelevant, what's it to you, let's please move on and talk about why Deep Space Nine is the best Star Trek.

Still, there are days that I cling vehemently to my woman identity because I've suffered from misogyny all my life, so I feel like I've earned the right to be a woman and speak for women, regardless of my gender, and ... that's kind of a weird thing to wrap my head around. Is an agender woman even a thing? I guess if it's what I am, then it is a thing, right? Somehow in my head I've separated being a woman from being gender: female, and like .... ?????

I am very open to dialogue here, and that's ultimately why I'm posting this publicly rather than just sticking it in a journal. I'm sure I have lots of blind spots, and I'm uncomfortably aware of how consistent this idea of wearing an identity for others is with the way girls are socialized, and how consistent it also is with my own C-PTSD. I'm certainly gender-apathetic, but from there, I'm still ... half questioning and half wondering what the point is in questioning if I don't care about the answer. What I can say after a lot of noodling is that I  have never experienced any kind of gender euphoria, and no pronouns have ever felt exciting or worth the hassle of replacing she/her, which are inoffensive to me/fine enough.

2019-02-04 22:23:08,an7691,8,1,"So it goes without saying that in order to be trans, you need body dysphoria over your AGAB body, not necessarily over your current body.  Not all trans people have body dysphoria, but that is because they've had very successful transitions.  

&amp;#x200B;

I have a question:  What differentiates nonbinary gender dysphoria from normal trans people?  For example, I dislike every aspect of maleness in my body, wrong genitals, I want to completely pass as female, I want a female voice.  Socially, I don't really care about whether I'm treated as a woman so long as I'm not treated as a man.  If people want to consider me some 3d gender, I couldn't care less just so long as that gender is not some kind of transmasculine or male gender.  I never really got offended by the ""Transwoman are Transwoman"" transrational  narratives.  Only if they make me out to be a man would I object.  Though I am in the minority as a lot of trans woman would hold a very strong view of wanting to be labeled as a woman and would object to being a 3d gender.

&amp;#x200B;

Transmen experience the 180 degree reverse of what I experience.

If people want to consider me some 3d gender, I couldn\'t care less just so long as that gender is not some kind of transmasculine or male gender.  I never really got offended by the ""Transwoman are Transwoman"" transrational  narratives.  Only if they make me out to be a man would I object.

However I never questioned my gender identity, mainly because I didn't even know that was a thing back then. I briefly experimented with male presentation, but quickly stopped when a friend said, ""you're not a boy, teatfairy!!"" So thus began a LONG period of trying to be feminine. I sorta took it to the extreme and tried to be very fem. Literally just doing things because they were feminine, not necessarily because I enjoyed it. 

While in school, in a sociology class, we were asked to make a list of things we would do if we woke up as the opposite sex the next day. I completely drew a blank, every other female in the class quickly had a list and many were giggling at the absolute absurdity of being the opposite sex, but I was like, ""I would do every thing I'd normally do except I'd have a penis?"" This lead me to do a lot of soul searching. I realized that I have NEVER felt female and the concept of feeling like a female was alien to me. It hit me like a ton of bricks and once I got over the initial shock it was like a weight was lifted. My sister in-law gave me some awesome information about being nb/agender, etc. 

My boyfriend shaved his eyebrows off and told me he prefers it that way, I don't necessarily enjoy the look but he's a wonderful human and I actually adjusted to it a lot easier than I thought. I say this because I told him I was going to stop shaving my armpits because of it, he was like, ""cool, whatever."" Then as the hair got thicker and thicker I felt so... Me! I felt 10x more comfortable with hairy armpits. Its something that helped me a lot in this kind of up and down period I'm in, I never thought my armpit hair would be so beneficial lol.

But I feel like I'm holding myself back. Why shouldn't I be happy to cut my hair the way I want to?

I'm afraid I'll be unnatractive. And feel insecure.

I've talked about it since July last year how I've wanted to cut my hair short again. When I had it short, I had to worry less about my hair and could focus on other things more. I felt less dysphoric and more confident. I took more pictures of myself and found myself attractive. I looked more lively. 

Now I feel shy because I'm embarrassed and uncomfortable with long hair. It's hot, and hard to manage. I want it gone but I'm afraid I'll regret it.

I cried nonstop when I cut my hair last time, as my (ex)assistant manager laughed at me when I came in the next day with my hair short. I... I don't know. It really scares me.

I get anxiety when I talk about cutting my hair. Or think about it too long. I want it gone but I'm afraid I'll miss it. I'm afraid I'll spend the next year growing it back out hoping I won't get laughed at anymore or judged. My ex boyfriend called me ugly the last time I cut my hair short... And the time before that, well... I got dumped. I know I have bad taste in guys, but I'm afraid.

I don't want to care about what other people think because it'll make ME happy, but I'm afraid I'll be miserable. I really care about what others think, even when I know I shouldn't. :'(.

Hi guys!! What's up?! [💖](https://emojipedia.org/sparkling-heart/)

Something that made you feel super validated and happy, anythign short will do! It will be for my next compilation available on theaters (YouTube) ! I'm a trans girl that makes meme compilations of transgender stuff (see [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU9HRNNj9VY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU9HRNNj9VY)) and at the end of each one I add not a meme but a short story about validating stories we have had! Since the first three were already mtf stories and the last one a compilation of ftm stories I thought I could add a story about NBs too! I usually get this from subs like [r/mtf](https://www.reddit.com/r/mtf), but here the dynamic is all different, and the top posts page is filled with just selfies, so I thought that maybe we could make of this thread a thread for you to share me the stories that have made you smile!

We are excited to celebrate our special day with you and in order to ensure that we have the most comfortable and enjoyable day possible we sincerely express the necessity of the following:
We request the general use of gender neutral terminology when referring to those involved in and attending the wedding. Some examples of gender neutral greetings and reference are; Folks, Friend(s), Everyone, Guest(s), Wedding Party, Best Person/People &amp; Etc. 
In specific we will NOT be using ANY gendered terms when referencing NAME, this includes the use of “Groom/Bride”, “Husband/Wife” &amp; Etc. A straightforward means to ensure these terms are not used would be to simply refer to NAME by their name. Some examples of welcomed terms are; Fiancé(s), Spouse(s), Partner(s), Newlywed(s) &amp; even simply “The Happy Couple”. 
We will require ALL guests to wear Pronoun markers throughout the celebration; which will be provided in the form of stickers upon entrance to the venue. 
The washrooms WILL be 100% gender neutral and are not single occupancy. This means that ALL guests will be welcome in ANY restroom. 
We understand those new to these concerns may require time to adjust. Be assured that mistakes will not be criticized as attempts and genuine respect is appreciated. That being said we wish to ensure this important day is enjoyed by all of our guests and most importantly by us. Thus it is with sadness that we must request those whom are unable, at a minimum attempt, to observe the above to regretfully decline this invitation. Any guests who choose to attend and are observed to be malicious or discourteous in retort to any of these points will be asked to leave. We sincerely hope you are able to attend and regret any apprehension these key points may evoke.

2019-02-08 12:02:56,aofv2j,0,1,"Heyo this is my story about transexperiences pronouns and names! I wanted to share it to see if some is feelin' me. It's long, so it's a bit of a rant, sorry! 

Since I've been a kid I've been having transexperiences, as in I've been ""forgetting"" that I'm a female. I could think about my future and see myself as an old man, or, in a nearer future, a boy. Then i woke up from the daydreaming and basically thought ""hmm... Right, I'm a female. Strange thoughts"". I was never that bothered with it, i just thought it was odd and decided not to tell ppl so that they couldn't make a big deal out of it. Back then the termnonbinary was not a thing, and i knew about transmen. I wondered if I was a transboy but shoved the thought aside, bc the narrative ""I was born in the wrong body"" (Wich was the only narrative I ever heard about transfolks) didn't click with me. For me, this is not the wrong body, it is my body, but I have just never been very attached to it! 

Then puberty happened and I found my body grotesque, but I didn't mind still. As I said, I didn't feel very attached to my body. I remember feeling weirded out by it in the bathtub, when I was with it in a way I never was otherwise, but on other occasions I was neglecting it, keeping my head in theclouds.  I still don't know if it was (and to a lesser extent still is) dysphoria/fatophobia/a general disgust of the human body/ a mix. This alienation of my body still occurs to me on the rare occasions I'm taking a bath. (I'm not disgusting, I shower.) And the even rarer occasions when I am being intimate with someone! 

I am definitely nonbinary. I was at a camp 1.5 years ago when the egg cracked. But the realisation was more of a ""okey, so I'm nonbinary. So what?"" And I kept on living my life presenting as a woman. If somebody would ask, I wouldnt deny that I'm nonbinary, and I did tell a few when it was suitable for the conversation, but I didn't wanna make a fuss about it. I did have a fight with my sister about her viewing as a woman when I was drunk once but that's about how intense it ever got.

Then a transperson I know told me; ""I thought I was asexual but really it was just dysphoria haha""and I felt like it hit something vital. After that I went home and ordered an agender t-shirt that I wear to this day. I started to discuss friwnds and family about that we should all use gender neutral pronouns as a default always. I didn't want to ask ppl to do it specifically for me, I wanted it to be the norm. I realised ppl wouldn't probably start a revolution with me, but seeing how passionate I was about it, referring ppl best I could with gender neutral pronouns,and a top of that wearing my agender t-shirt, at least maybe someone would start referring me the same without me having to tell them how to use language with me. I do not want to tell ppl how to use language with me, I just want things to float. 

But ppl did not catch on. After europride this we I told my to stop using such gendered  language about me. Then, a couple of weeks later, I was out sailing with my sister and friends, and I had a breakdown where I just cried about pronouns and gender to my sister and her sambo. Still I explicitly didn't tell them to use gender neutral pronouns, I just cried about me being an alien and not getting gender. They still didn't catch on. A week later I explicitly told them in their appartment that I want them to use gender neutral pronouns with me. After that I kept telling ppl.

But I knew there was gonna meet problems, Wich is why I didn't want to bother in the first place; when being met in other linguistical spheres that has a more binary language I would have to choose. A top of that my uncle, that calls me she bc they do not recognize gender neutral pronouns in their vocabulary, tells me that they don't go around meeting new people saying ""hey my name is x and my pronouns is he"" (we have the kind of relationship where I call them them tho they use he bc they call me she tho I prefer they). For me, that likes to let things float, it is good that they behave like this, bc I do need to find a way to relate to that fact.

So what I did was crafting a new name for myself, one that wouldnt make ppl assume, one that would make ppl wonder as soon as I've said my name. 

When I finally, this winter, settled with something I was happy with, I was euphoric. The ppl I interact with daily now  use it for me. But I do miss my old name as well. It was feminine, but I didnt mind that per ce, it was my name , and I had my own relationship to it. Now I feel like I  have to choose. My new name clearly fills a practical function my old name didn't, and I love it. But my old name I do not want to let go of, for I love it as well. I am starting to think of going name poly; presenting as new name but still recognizing my old name. Idk. It'll come to me. 

My grandma says I should let it be. They are a lot like me, and I feel them, but I also feel  as we can't always let things be, or we'll stagnate. But now, I think it is time for me to finally follow their advice for a while.

I’ve only just come out as nonbinary (demigender) the last few months or so. Many of my friends (not family, they’ll never understand so I don’t even try) are still finding out about it and understanding. I’ve been proudly out and open as pansexual for over 2 years, but this is different. 

For examples, one of the things I want most in life is to have kids. I’d love to try to be pregnant one day since I have the ability but the thought of it makes me feel dysphoric. I’ve been questioning what I wear every day now because I’ve started to feel so self conscious about my “appearance” and how people might perceive me, gender-wise. And because I present as “feminine”, I’ve been misgendered out the wazoo lately,  both accidentally and intentionally, and it’s so painful and deflating.

2019-02-09 20:30:39,aowcp5,1,1,"I feel pretty confident identifying as non-binary, but the idea of whether or not to transition and trying to understand my own dysphoria can be really difficult for me. So I guess I'm hoping to vent and see if anyone can relate.

I used to be fairly certain that I wanted top surgery. In my early-to-mid 20's, it was one of my main goals. I've also considered going on testosterone off and on, and have experimented with presenting as male. However, it's pretty much impossible for me to pass as male without being on T, and trying to present as male is stressful, honestly. I don't like binding my chest because it's uncomfortable and makes me extra aware of and self-conscious about my chest. I don't like how hard it is to find men's clothes that fit me. And I don't always mind how women's clothes fit me, as long as they're not extremely feminine. When I spend time with transmasculine people who are transitioning, I feel self-conscious sometimes because they're a lot more manly than I am. I don't know how to tell the difference between signs that transitioning isn't right for me and general frustration with the process. Like, if I felt great when I bind my chest, that would be a great sign that having top surgery is the right move. Since I don't like binding, it's harder for me to feel certain about things like that.

Meanwhile, as I've gotten older, I have found that my dysphoria has mellowed out some. I can look in the mirror and kind of like how my breasts look, for example. And part of me likes the idea of being able to ""make it work"" as a woman. I actually feel a strong connection to being AFAB. I've always identified strongly with the lesbian community. Honestly, I'm really scared to lose that. But I still feel kind of disconnected from it all. Like, I can appreciate my body, but I don't know if I feel at home in it. I guess I feel a little like a character in a story who gets magically transformed or something and can't change back. It's not terrible, and maybe I can be happy like this, but it doesn't always feel like ""me."" I worry sometimes that I'm just lying to myself because transitioning is daunting and complicated. I still get jealous sometimes when I encounter someone who has transitioned, and I still get dysphoric sometimes when I see a man I wish I resembled more or could dress like. I feel weird meeting new people sometimes because I feel like they're not seeing the ""real"" me. But then I wonder if maybe I've taught myself to feel that way and can teach myself not to anymore.

We are a super supportive household, and so they are able to dress how they want, have the haircut they want, etc. They are also out at school, and we have instructed teachers to use gender neutral pronouns, respect my child, etc. We are also going to meet with a pediatric trans specialist very soon. Now, on to the exciting (and terrifying) stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

My child has had a crush on a boy for a VERY long time. They were talking the other night, my child expressed feelings, and he said he liked her back and they decided to go out. Aside from him not knowing what to refer to my child as (they don't want girlfriend or boyfriend or anything, so for now they are using ""accomplice,"" which I think is hilarious), I am nervous what this means. It's scary enough for your kids to begin dating anyhow, this is a whole area I'm unprepared for. 

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, this boy's family are VERY anti-LGBTQ, and even threw a fit when they first found out my kid was NB (our kids are in an extremely small school/homeschool group, and they have been friends/best friends for a few years). The boy seems totally fine with everything, uses neutral pronouns, etc., and the kids at school are in general pretty cool. But this is just really scary. For now, they are keeping it a secret from his parents. 

&amp;#x200B;

This whole thing feels like a bunch of small bombs that could go off at any time, and I don't want my kid to get hurt. I love them desperately.

2019-02-11 20:09:41,apkdu5,8,1,"I tried posting this on /r/genderqueer but it got removed and I don't know why... so I guess I'll try here? Sorry this is long af; the last two paragraphs could probably work as a tldr lol.   

So I'm afab. But a lot of things have led me to start questioning my gender. And I'm just confused and I don't know if I'm just a super masculine/butch cis girl, or agender, or a demigirl, or genderfluid, or what. I'm also autistic and I know dysphoria

I guess my first instances with gender were when I was super young, like 3-4 years old. At preschool, during recess, they would often play boy vs girl games. And half the time I'd go to the boy's side (I think at one point I'd even made a schedule -- Mondays and Wednesdays were boy days, and Fridays were girl days lol).

My parents were, I'm guessing starting that age up until I was about 13, very against ""girly"" things. They said anything ""girly"" was stupid -- makeup, fashion, dolls, etc. (when I turned 13 or so, they started expecting me to be more girly, but i never did)

Despite this, during elementary school, a lot of my friends were girls. And I remember being fairly interested in dolls and even somewhat in makeup during that time.

Then I guess things started to change? I'm not very sure on the specifics.

When my mother first said I needed to wear a bra, I cried. At the time I think it was because I didn't want to grow up. But ever since then (I'm 19 now), I've layered up on top to avoid having to wear one, and to avoid people seeing that I have them. They're not even that big lol they're tiny af. Even in the hottest days of summer, I wear a big sweatshirt. I just want them gone. I don't even like saying the words lol. Anything tight I just won't wear. Last semester I had to wear a dress for something that was pretty tight, so I bought some training bras and now I wear those every time I can't wear a baggy sweatshirt. They're so tight but they work. It's still not enough tho... I had my arms in some pretty weird positions to try to cover the chest stuff lol.

I've always hated dresses and skirts. They feel so wrong. But I'm autistic and have sensory issues, and any pants other than sweatpants are torture, so I've just learned to suffer being super uncomfortable while wearing skirts and dresses.

I've also recently (and I think before a little, but I gained some weight so it wasn't as obvious) had problems with my thighs and hips and butt. Theyr'e just huge lol. I hate them. (I have a lot of problems eating too, because I just want to make myself as little like a girl as possible).

I've always been more masculine, and I don't really care about gender roles. In fact, I kinda take pride in smashing them lol. I like being ""that girl who smashes gender roles and acts like a dude"".

I cut my hair super short about a year ago after years of wanting it short, and it felt soooo much better. And now, people assume I'm a boy (usually a super young one, but whatever). I kinda like that too tho? I like when people misgender me lol. But thne I also like people seeing me as a girl.

Being called a ""woman"" or ""lady"" also makes me cringe so hard. I hate it.

At first I thought it was just me having a complex about growing up. But I don't think it is (or at least, not all). I wish I had a more masculine body. i see pictures of cis men wearing suits and clotehs and everything, and I want to look like that. But I'm not trans. I don't have any lower dysphoria, and I definitely want to be as hairless as possible so I would freak out if I got any more hair lol.

Idk. This is all super confusing. It's like... I want people to see me as a girl. But I want to have a sexless body and I want to get misgendered.

What could this be?? I thought maybe demigirl, but a lot of the definitions say that it doesnt include dysphoria, and I have some kind of dysphoria I think. At least upper dysphoria.

2019-02-13 09:25:33,aq4t9p,3,1,"Tl;dr at the bottom. So I'm nonbinary afab, formally identify as agender. I've been pursuing top surgery since September, but I've run into a few roadblocks on getting the required letter of endorsement from a behavioral health professional. I see a therapist through my college, and she's very supportive, but our college's mental health services will not allow her to write the necessary letter. I also get meds for depression from a psychiatrist off-campus, and when I talked to him about it, he initially agreed to write the letter but backed out later in an email, saying that he's worried about surgery interfering with my depression and my plan to recover in the dorms. (The obvious responses are that 1. dysphoria itself is the greatest contributor to my depression and 2. I don't have anywhere else to go, but judging by his tone and the fact that he didn't ask me to explain anything, just stated his perspective, I'm fairly sure that it's more out of transphobia than actual concern, so I'm seeking help elsewhere.)

I have an appointment with a behavioral health professional next week at Fenway Health in Boston, which specializes in trans healthcare. Their behavioral health department often takes on trans people whose outside doctors are subject to either personal or systematic transphobia, and it's likely that I'll have the letter of recommendation at the end of that meeting. So, how do I make sure that the doctor I'm seeing is convinced of my dysphoria and need for top surgery? So far, I've made a list of my symptoms:
-perceived chest is flat, as opposed to irl chest
-Persistent feeling of wrongness, like a discomfort that's always there, something stuck in my throat that I'm perpetually conscious of. Like when clothing is itchy or fits badly
-Pushing down breasts, only wearing sports bras, hunching over to hide
-Not a dislike of the chest - I'm attracted to breasts and they're alright ones, they're just not for me
-Heavy contributor to depression - it takes a lot of mental energy to deal with the fact that dysphoria makes me feel shit and then still get up and do work and go to class
-Also applies to other aspects of gender - voice, facial shape, hips
-Got really severe during puberty. Has lasted fairly consistently since then. I found identity in being butch

But I want to make sure. What have you guys found success with saying to doctors? How can I make sure that the woman I'm seeing understands nb identities and the need for transition within that?

I see a therapist through my college, and she's very supportive, but our college's mental health services will not allow her to write the necessary letter. I also get meds for depression from a psychiatrist off-campus, and when I talked to him about it, he initially agreed to write the letter but backed out later in an email, saying that he's worried about surgery interfering with my depression and my plan to recover in the dorms. (The obvious responses are that 1. dysphoria itself is the greatest contributor to my depression and 2. I don't have anywhere else to go, but judging by his tone and the fact that he didn't ask me to explain anything, just stated his perspective, I'm fairly sure that it's more out of transphobia than actual concern, so I'm seeking help elsewhere.)\n\nI have an appointment with a behavioral health professional next week at Fenway Health in Boston, which specializes in trans healthcare. Their behavioral health department often takes on trans people whose outside doctors are subject to either personal or systematic transphobia, and it's likely that I'll have the letter of recommendation at the end of that meeting. So, how do I make sure that the doctor I'm seeing is convinced of my dysphoria and need for top surgery? So far, I've made a list of my symptoms:\n-perceived chest is flat, as opposed to irl chest\n-Persistent feeling of wrongness, like a discomfort that's always there, something stuck in my throat that I'm perpetually conscious of. Like when clothing is itchy or fits badly\n-Pushing down breasts, only wearing sports bras, hunching over to hide\n-Not a dislike of the chest - I'm attracted to breasts and they're alright ones, they're just not for me\n-Heavy contributor to depression - it takes a lot of mental energy to deal with the fact that dysphoria makes me feel shit and then still get up and do work and go to class\n-Also applies to other aspects of gender - voice, facial shape, hips\n-Got really severe during puberty. Has lasted fairly consistently since then. I found identity in being butch\n\nBut I want to make sure. What have you guys found success with saying to doctors? How can I make sure that the woman I'm seeing understands nb identities and the need for transition within that?\n\nTl;dr how do I convince doctors that my identity and dysphoria are real?"", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'How to talk to doctors?

Dear society,

    I can totally understand your love for the binary lie. That man and woman picket fence 2.5 children dream

But as someone born as a limited edition model with the extra features.  INTERSEX. 

I and others and surgeons and endocrinologist and general doctors and the ultrasound nurse and mri tech can testify under oath.  Your binary is bullshit, and I ain’t imaginary. 

I used to hate my hands and feet. Estrogen hardens cartilage early in puberty. Before the cramps and nausea and other symptoms forced me to go to doctors and BAM found out I was the limited edition with extra features. 

Why did I hate them?  Cause I and society compare ourselves against the binary.  5’9” and easily fit size 9 women’s Nike’s and my wedding ring is a size 7 easy

I used to be obsessed with wanting to be NORMAL.  Fock normal. 

I used estrogen blockers and androgen compounding to counter AIS for 2 decades til my liver said fock normal.  

I dig my trans friends cause they have courage to be who they want and not what society wants.  My non-binary friends dgaf and that makes me smile 😊 

I admit seeing a dude in a dress he can’t pull off makes me cringe. But more cause his fashion sense is off and my stupid programming to be that binary lie society loves so much.  

Pretty much to sum this up. Don’t stop being you, cause fake people suck.

I'm engaged to the greatest man in the world. And children are *way* off in the future, but it's a topic that has come up a few times since we got engaged recently.

He wants kids. He was born to be a father, I'm certain of it. He adores kids, kids adore him. He's every woman in a Hallmark movie's dream. I want him to have kids.

I don't *not* want kids. I don't particularly dislike kids. I've always been kind of neutral towards the idea of having them, electing to just go with whatever my partner wanted. I know that if I have kids, I want at least some of them to be biological, and I know he wants biological children.

But everything about pregnancy scares the ever loving shit out of me. 

You throw up a bunch, you can't sleep, you have to pee all the time, your body contorts and swells to make room for a whole other human, and then I have to squeeze this other human out of a space that barely wants to stretch enough for a *pleasurable* experience?

When I thought I was cis I always just brushed this off as not wanting kids. But now that I do kind of want kids, and I know I'm nonbinary, but I still feel so distressed about it, I'm wondering if it's some kind of Dysphoria? I don't really have physical Dysphoria in my every day Life. But seeing a heavily pregnant person or an article about ""10 things they  don't tell you about being pregnant"" makes me feel like my body is trying to turn inside out.

And it's not just pain of childbirth that scares me. The entire experience of being pregnant is repulsive to me. I see these stock images of women lovingly stroking their bulging stomachs and I'm disgusted because it doesn't make sense to me. It's like someone's trying to trick me into thinking this insane thing is something completely fine and normal when it's not. But I know it *is* normal. Or else the human race would not be what it is.

I don't understand how something can put you through 9 months of discomfort and then incredible pain and then you're just like ""this weird lump of human and drool and poop that doesn't even know anything exists yet is my baby that I squished out of me that I love.""

I'm scared that I'm gonna resent my baby even though it's not its fault that I chose to have one. It's not babies' fault that pregnancy sucks so much.

Does anyone else have similar feelings? Did you have kids? Am I just doomed to either muscle my way through a pregnancy or break my fiance's heart? Is there a way to make it better?

I\'ve read about people saying they feel more in touch with their emotions and feel more like themselves. Having softer and smoother skin sounds really great. Like, it just sounds great to ""smell like a woman"" or whatever. I never really have liked body hair, like at all, so the idea of it thinning is appealing. One of the coolest moments of my life was when I got a razor. It was like a magic hair remover wand, and I shaved all over my body right away. For some reason, just the idea of crying more is exiting? But like, at the same time, saying ""I am a woman"" or ""I want to become a woman"" doesn\'t feel right..? But saying ""I am a boy"" doesn\'t feel perfect either? And I don\'t really think I want breasts. So, I\'m not sure if I\'m a cis male who is just uncomfortable with his body, or if I\'m nb, and I don\'t think I\'m trans, but I could be? \n\nSorry for the long post.

2019-02-14 06:04:39,aqgnll,0,1,"Hi guys,
My name is Alex. I’m 25 and reside in Southern California. 
My gender identity has always been very controversial for me. Over the years it’s been very easy to just identify as a feminine cis male. I’ve always been feminine. From the very beginning all my friends were girls and I’d always feel “uncomfortable” around men and always was shy around them. I always associated myself with sailor moon and other main female characters in shows. I always wanted to be a girl that would save the world or do good. Even as a child I remember playing video games with my family and friends and only ever wanting to play as a female character (example: daisy from Mario kart etc) As the years went on I came out as gay and was ok. I never really “thought” about it if that makes sense but I always remember not liking to be called a “man” I remember my mom would call me a man and I would shudder as if it was a bad word. To me it was the weirdest thing but again call me slow or whatever but it really didn’t hit me until recently (couple of months ago) that I seriously considered the thought that I may be trans. To be quite honest I’ve come to the conclusion that I’m gender non-binary leaning towards female. I don’t necessarily feel like I’m completely in the wrong body but I do associate myself with wanting curves and smooth skin and even boobs.  My insurance is through Kaiser SoCal and coincidently today I made an appointment to see a physiatrist about a new depression/anxiety medication regime and after seeing a therapist (appointment already made). I was wondering if this is something I should talk to my main doctor about since she I haven’t come out or should I just wait to talk to my physiatrist OR therapist? I’m just a bit confused at what to do or where to start. I wish places made it a little easier especially for people that aren’t fully out yet and or confused.

Hiya. I’m new here and just wanted to get this off my chest. I’m afab and have always had a weird relationship with gender, but only started experimenting with it July last year (I’m 23). U started using they/them pronouns then, in addition to she/her, but since September have been using they/them exclusively. I have really supportive friends who are largely nb and trans themselves, so that’s really helped, but I’m struggling with my family. 

My mums always told me that she’d accept me no matter who I am. I’ve come out to her about my sexuality like, twice, and everything has been fine. She’s not taking gender issues as well. 

It’s weird. She’s helped me bind my chest, even bought me sports bras a size to small while I was dysphoric and waiting for my binder to arrive, but she’s never used the correct pronouns or my preferred name (which is just a shortened form of my birth name). She told me that using my new name might be hard for her to get her head around, which I said was fine. I only want her to try. But she hasn’t been. 

About 2 days ago, she called me by my birth name. When I told her that’s not me name, she said “it is, actually, that’s what your birth certificate says.” And I’ve been dwelling on it for a bit but confronted her about it today. She apologised, and said she’d do better, but I didn’t miss the huge sigh she let out first. 

On top of this, my brother is awful. I’ve been avoiding this subject with him bc I know he doesn’t believe in genders outside of the binary, but my mum went away recently and it was just the 2 of us. It started to weigh on me, so I corrected him about my name and he didn’t take it well. 

I’m hoping to move out soon but damn. I know this could be worse, but the way my mum just does nothing is really frustrating me.

2019-02-16 08:07:25,ar6t6h,2,7,"Hello there all~ c:

From my understanding, sex and gender are separate things. I’ve always felt comfortable with my anatomy itself, but the fact people tend to automatically attach gender identity, expression, and roles with my sex has always felt... wrong. As a kid, I couldn’t truly fit in with one gender over another, and I remember having many moments of discomfort and confusion over it. I thought that would change as I grew up, and I’d gradually adjust to taking on a ‘womanly’ identity, but it never happened lol.

2019-02-16 23:19:34,areczy,9,4,"Hi,

I'm almost 21, and I was assigned female at birth. I am not really sure about my gender anymore and I wanted to ask for help.

So, I never knew that transitioning was a possibility growing up. I'm from an extremely religious background (Christian/Mormon) and I was really taught to behave in ways that conformed with my community's expectations of women. But, I never really felt comfortable with it. 

I as a kid, even up until grade 3 (around 9 yrs old) would try to tell people my name was different (I chose a male name for myself), and I would say, ""I am a boy"" until it was threatened that my family would be called to get me to stop those behaviors. I would choose clothing that I found in the boys section, I would refuse (to the point of throwing a tantrum) to wear dresses or pink. I was always wanting to play with only boys until I hit puberty (at 9 yrs old which is when I gave up on telling people I was a boy) and all of my male friends rejected me because they were uncomfortable with my boobs and other body changes. In high school I had a posted of Capt. America on my wall and I lifted weights and excercised religiously hoping I would eventually look like him. But, it didn't work.

My family told me that puberty meant I was a woman and that I would have to start shaving, etc. I was pushed into learning to be a ""lady"" very hard. When I didn't do the right thing I was called a dike and other kids told me I was disgusting. So, I just gave in and tried really hard to fit in. 

Now, I think out of fear, I am really good at playing the part. But, it feels like playing a part. When I participate in ""feminine"" behaviors it's almost a parody of it. I will just be over the top. And I don't even feel like my body is mine. It's just something I have and decorate, enjoy, and have fun with. It doesn't really represent my internal experience of the world. I make jokes when I wear a tight dress, like, ""Oh, look I am such a hoe haha."" I'm also bisexual/pansexual and so I almost feel attracted to certain aspects of my own body because I am just that detached from it. 

But lately, I have just hated what I see in the mirror more than usual. I had cut off my hair almost to a buzz cut 2 years ago and nothing made me more confident. But everyone around me complained that my beautiful hair was gone and I should grow it back. Now, it is back and I hate it. It makes me uncomfortable to even look at. I want to hide it. And I am wearing more and more male clothing and feeling more comfortable in it than other clothing items.

At the same time though, I just want people to accept and like me. And to do that I feel like I have to continue on living as a woman. I am scared what will happen if I don't. But, the only way I feel comfortable playing that part is just taking it up to the level of being a cartoon character in appearance. Bright makeup, tight clothes, etc.

Am I experiencing gender dysphoria?

Am I nonbinary because I can live as a woman without it causing huge distress?

How can I tell if this is a phase I will grow out of, or if I am gender fluid, or if I am trans masculine?

**Project Description:** 

The purpose of this study is to explore the self-reported prevalence of gender-voice incongruence in the TING population, and voice-health information seeking behaviors for those individuals who access information and services relating to gender-voice affirmation.  
Any TING individuals, who are residents of the United States of America and 18 years or older, are welcome to complete this survey. If you decide to participate in this research, you will be asked to complete one electronic survey. The questions in the survey relate to the prevalence, incidence, and nature of communicative impairment in the TING community, in addition to service and information accessibility relating to gender-voice affirmation. The survey will take approximately 15 minutes to complete.  
Your survey responses will be kept anonymous. You will have the option of providing your name and email address to participate in a prize draw.  No additional identifiable information will be gathered from this survey.  
Your permission is voluntary. Due to the nature of this study, there is a risk that some individuals will experience psychological stress relating to discussing gender-voice incongruence and gender-dysphoria. At any point during the study you may decide to not answer a question, or to cease participation, and be excluded from the study.",NonBinary,[Mod Approved] How well does your voice represent who you are?

This project is about porn sites, and the navigational journeys one goes through in order to find content. Porn sites are said to hold everything and anything you could ever think of. As the old saying goes, “If you can think of it, there is porn of it.” But, is this really true? Just how easy is it to navigate through porn sites, and find content that represents your own desires? These are some of the questions I wish to answer in my master’s thesis. This research is specifically on video “tube” sites (sites such as PornHub, XHamster, XVideos, and so on). Written or audio erotica is not included in the scope of this study. My research will not be used to take an “anti-porn” or “pro-porn” stance, but merely aims to analyse how these free sites are used. For my thesis, I have developed an anonymous online questionnaire.

&amp;#x200B;

You may be eligible to answer this questionnaire if you…

* Are over 18 years old 
* Visit free video porn sites on a regular, or semi-regular basis
* Have a spare 10 minutes

So, i don't know where to start, it's probably the first time i talk about being non-binary on the net and in english !   
I knew that something was wrong when i was a teenager, and for a long time i thought i was trans despite feeling something was not right. Some years ago, still very in the closet, i heard about the possibility of being non-binary and it changed my outlook on this matter. Since then i tried to strip myself from a part of the masculinity i wore (i'm assigned male at birth... AMAB.. ? Is that how we say it..?), i, for one, stopped to wear only black clothes, died and colored some of my hair, adapted a bit of my language and, the most subtle but the most important, i adapted my behavior and what sweat from me, my aura if you prefer.   


I'm still very much inside the closet as i live in a country and in an environment where not gloryfying male identity when you are one is really badly seen (words like « they » also didn't exist in my language).   
I talked very carefully with some people at prides and in some private circles, but non-binary peoples are more scarce than trans, for example.   
I have tons of questions all the times... Like, i do feel that i want to transitionate in some form, but i don't know how. Did you do some sort of transition, even without hormone.. And how do you did it ?   
Over the course of years i projected a lot in my partner (they were all females), is it bad ? I feel like if i talk about that it may seem like i have some sort of fetish for tomboyish girl or androgynous people (and they do have some appeal to me) but deep down i clearly feel it's more than that and more than just wanting to be the other gender (as i'm also aware that the grass seem more green on the other side but it's far more complicated and i should not think so simply).  
I have quite a lot of facial hair and i think they suit me, but then again, i'm confused about this part of my look and how i feel. What do you think about it.. ? Also, as there is no neutral pronouns in my mother tongue, non-binary people made one, i doesn't feel that much invalidated when called by the pronouns corresponding to my gender assignated at birth. It may keep me in the closet and forbid me to stand my ground when needed, tho....   
I'm a bit lost and i feel exposed just with talking about all of that but i'm searching for answers and with the proportion of the subject i have difficulty to think straight, so i'm counting on y'all with sharing some of your experiences.

I have a lot of trust issues with men. It would take A LOT for me to consider getting into a relationship with one, a lot of emotional reassurance and nurturing and caring but anyways I digress.

I'm not out to any family about my gender cuz I know a lot of them either wouldn't be fond of me being non-cis let alone nb, and anyways the only people who really know are some of my closer friends and my boyfriend. My issue is I want to try to be more out to more people at my school and especially teachers but because I look so cis and am very not used to being referred to with they/them pronouns—not to mention I'm just very soft spoken in general— I just have a hard time letting people know I'm not cis and I like they/them. Plus because I'm still hearing my old gendered pronouns everyday I misgender myself all the time eithr verbally or in my head and don't even notice sometimes.

I'm currently training to be a teacher of English to speakers of other languages. Some of y'all may already realize how anxiety-inducing it can be to be an NB teacher. I've gotten a lot of stares from kids and a LOT of ""Are you a boy or a girl?"" Often, I am so afraid of rejection that I deflect those questions. I don't even try to tell students my pronouns (I will answer to she, but prefer they.) I try to go by my first name to avoid the ""Miss""/""Mister"" situation, but usually they call me ""Miss"" or ""Miss brimohekate"".

There are many reasons why I don't speak up to them. As I said above, I'm afraid they will reject me or refuse to use my pronouns. I don't want to take up class time talking about myself because their learning is more important. I worry about negative parent reactions if students go home and talk about my pronouns or identity. Some of the students come from cultures where nonbinary or trans identities are viewed very negatively, so I'm also fearful that they'll see me as less than. I do think it's essential to be authentic with students, and also that it's important students be educated about NB and trans identities. It's just so hard in practice.

WITH ALL THAT SAID. Last week I helped out in a class where students had to create posters that included their multiple identities and decide which ones they felt marginalized them and which ones they felt gave them privilege. I made my own as a model. Part of the assignment was sharing with other students some of your identities, so I walked around and interacted with them. Most of my identities give me a lot of privilege, but I feel like I am marginalized for my queerness and my gender. I shared this with some students who I thought would take me seriously, and I was so relieved when they accepted what I said. I didn't even share my pronouns, but simply sharing that I don't identify as a woman or a man and often get misgendered felt like a weight lifting off my shoulders.

Even now, I love dressing up in robes and kilts and skirted attire far more than in pants. I own a caftan that I only ever dare wear around the house. Being told unironically that I'm ""pretty"" thrills me way more than being told I'm ""handsome"", which feels like it doesn't fit.

2019-02-21 15:59:00,at4qjr,2,10,"Hi all! This is a delurking! It's great that this subreddit exists. I wonder if anyone is experiencing what I am--it seems like people post talking about similar situations from time to time, but I don't know who is still here or maybe also new.

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess I came out to myself as nb a little over a year ago, after *yeeeeearrrs* of being all but there but not doing it for some reason, probably some kind of nb impostor syndrome. (I am far from being the most masculine-presenting person in the world but am still very easily read as a ""man,"" and have tons of social dysphoria and some, but not nearly so much, body dysphoria.) Just in 2019 I've started slowly coming out to friends and at work and school (which are the same place). I've also started HRT at low doses; I've been taking E for six weeks and a day, and spiro for four weeks and a day.

&amp;#x200B;

One thing I'm wondering if anyone else has also felt is that my biggest expectation of HRT before starting it was that it would at least clear up for me how much change in my body I want. (I don't expect any of the changes likely on a timeframe of six months or so to make me less happy with my body, and I'd been considering HRT even before I came out to myself, if that makes sense; so strange as it might sound it feels right to have started it even without being 100% certain what I wanted out of it.) But I still feel some uncertainty, if maybe a little less, along with some.. excitement? like it positively is what I want. I haven't noticed any permanent physical changes yet, only softer skin and hair, but of course it's still early, especially at half-doses. If I'm being honest, I both have days where I feel like I should stop, and have days where I feel like asking for full doses and planning to continue on them indefinitely. Has anyone else felt this kind of ambivalence in this kind of situation?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, again, there's that ""not feeling nb enough"" thing. Part of it is that I'm 37, which isn't *exactly* old (lately I keep remembering Dennis in Monty Python and the Holy Grail, saying ""I'm 37, I'm not old!"") but definitely turns up the body dysphoria as I visibly age in ways many amab people do, like my face getting more sort of Neanderthal-shaped and hair loss that isn't super-pronounced (yet) but definitely definitely noticeable. I wish I'd come out and started HRT like 15 years ago, frankly (though I suppose 15 years ago it would have been harder to access, both financially and uh, medical-gatekeeping-ly.) I know this isn't ""supposed to"" be true and maybe it's shitty to give voice to, but it feels to me like it's kind of de facto true, that nb social spaces and even identities aren't really ""for"" people like me, and are more accessible to younger afab people. Has anyone else felt their age complicates ""claiming"" nbness?

First off, I want to thank you for even considering spending your time and energy on my existence. I've been in a very funky place lately and don't feel particularly entitled to ask others for any sort of help. But here I am, in case anyone is feeling generous.

My birth name is the name of a type of tree and I absolutely love that, as I'm a big tree-hugger. However, it is a very gendered name and I'd really love to have something more neutral. I've thought about other names that start with the same letter, but am kind of moving on from that.

I'm particularly drawn to ""Aspen"", but apparently it's very much a ""girl"" name. Plus, my nickname might turn to ""ass"", which is both perfect and also not perfect, haha. Apparently another name my parents considered for me was ""Ryan"" or ""Bryan"", and I've been dwelling on how I can play with that; currently I'm thinking ""Rye"" or ""Rhye"". I love the country feel, the nature/hippie feel, but I'm a little paranoid that it might be a bit gendered.

Any thoughts on the name Rye? I'm also open to other nature-inspired/hippie type names that might be ambiguously-gendered.

2019-02-22 17:18:28,atk6h6,10,27,"So yesterday I went to a trans meet up at a bar. This was my experience as a non-binary person.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday I was given short notice of a casual meet up/ trans night at a bar in my city. I decided to go alone despite having anxiety about being without a friend. I got there and was early so I settled in at the bar and had a drink. Being a lightweight a few sips of cheap beer had me smiling and ready to meet people. The organizers showed up and I got to talking to them and then sitting a a big table with the group. For about an hour or so I was talking to a transman and another afab non-binary person about hormones, surgery and our experiences at local doctors. 

&amp;#x200B;

So the other non-binary person, I'll call Pat,  was with their trans girlfriend, I'll call Amanda (not their actual names). Amanda was across the table and we didn't really talk at all. Well halfway through a conversation Pat notices that a very shy person has arrived and is floating around the table. Pat invites them to sit and started talking to them. In that process Amanda makes space for them by switching to sit by me.

&amp;#x200B;

Amanda and I start talking about trans experiences, stuff like hair cuts our voices etc. At first it's fine but then Amanda says to me, ""I would call myself a chaser of trans people while being trans. I just want to sleep with all the trans people-"" then she looks me up and down and clarifies, ""Especially more trans gir- trans guys.""

&amp;#x200B;

I smile awkwardly and shake my head and explain that I don't identify as a guy. At that point I had introduced myself and my preferred pronouns. She shrugs and says, ""Well you look like a guy so I'm just going to think of you that way."" Normally that would bother me enough to end a conversation but I was drunk and giving her more  lenience  as she is also a trans person. Anyways I try to explain again that I am not a guy and not a girl. She kinda blows it off and asks me if im poly. I say no, that my partner and I are practicing monogamy and i'm very committed to them.

&amp;#x200B;

From there the conversation turned. She then asked  if I have bottom dysphoria. I answer honestly and say not really, that I've wondered what a penis is like but I don't really want one. She then started talking about her genitals a lot, I don't talk about mine. Mostly she's saying that she doesn't mind her penis unless it's during sex. The conversation isn't really something I want to talk about or share so I didn't say much, just listened with a drunk dopey expression.

&amp;#x200B;

At some point she asks me to sit away from the group because she can't hear me. I had just finished a drink and was happy drunk and followed her over to a bench. I was trapped in and couldn't really get out unless I asked her to move. At first it didn't bother me. Until she reached her arm around the back of the bench and joked, ""I'm not being very subtle.""  I inched away. She said, ""I wanted to sleep with my boyfriend Pat before coming here but he (not Pat's pronouns) wasn't into it. I want to sleep with you.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Amanda looked at me and said, ""Yeah I can tell you're committed and not interested. Ya know being rejected over and over again makes me dysphoric."" That made me feel bad, I wasn't trying to cause dysphoria. At the time I wasn't thinking clearly and didn't realize how manipulative that is from one trans person to another.

I thought she understood I didn't want anything sexual until a few seconds later she pointed down at her lap and said, ""Look I'm getting hard."" I glanced and then looked away. Before I could say anything she added, ""If you want you can touch it to see what's it's like. It's not cheating because I wont get anything out of it.""

&amp;#x200B;

I say no. And she shrugs and says, ""I'm autistic so I don't get boundaries."" At that moment the guy who told me about the meet up was leaving and waved. I waved and then remarked that I needed to go because I wake up early. I left before I felt sober enough to and somehow made it to a friends apartment safely to hang out with their dog until I sobered up enough to trek home over icy sidewalks.

This was my experience as a non-binary person.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday I was given short notice of a casual meet up/ trans night at a bar in my city. I decided to go alone despite having anxiety about being without a friend. I got there and was early so I settled in at the bar and had a drink. Being a lightweight a few sips of cheap beer had me smiling and ready to meet people. The organizers showed up and I got to talking to them and then sitting a a big table with the group. For about an hour or so I was talking to a transman and another afab non-binary person about hormones, surgery and our experiences at local doctors. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the other non-binary person, I\'ll call Pat,  was with their trans girlfriend, I\'ll call Amanda (not their actual names). Amanda was across the table and we didn\'t really talk at all. Well halfway through a conversation Pat notices that a very shy person has arrived and is floating around the table. Pat invites them to sit and started talking to them. In that process Amanda makes space for them by switching to sit by me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAmanda and I start talking about trans experiences, stuff like hair cuts our voices etc. At first it\'s fine but then Amanda says to me, ""I would call myself a chaser of trans people while being trans. I just want to sleep with all the trans people-"" then she looks me up and down and clarifies, ""Especially more trans gir- trans guys.""\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI smile awkwardly and shake my head and explain that I don\'t identify as a guy. At that point I had introduced myself and my preferred pronouns. She shrugs and says, ""Well you look like a guy so I\'m just going to think of you that way."" Normally that would bother me enough to end a conversation but I was drunk and giving her more  lenience  as she is also a trans person. Anyways I try to explain again that I am not a guy and not a girl. She kinda blows it off and asks me if im poly. I say no, that my partner and I are practicing monogamy and i\'m very committed to them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom there the conversation turned. She then asked  if I have bottom dysphoria. I answer honestly and say not really, that I\'ve wondered what a penis is like but I don\'t really want one. She then started talking about her genitals a lot, I don\'t talk about mine. Mostly she\'s saying that she doesn\'t mind her penis unless it\'s during sex. The conversation isn\'t really something I want to talk about or share so I didn\'t say much, just listened with a drunk dopey expression.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt some point she asks me to sit away from the group because she can\'t hear me. I had just finished a drink and was happy drunk and followed her over to a bench. I was trapped in and couldn\'t really get out unless I asked her to move. At first it didn\'t bother me. Until she reached her arm around the back of the bench and joked, ""I\'m not being very subtle.""  I inched away. She said, ""I wanted to sleep with my boyfriend Pat before coming here but he (not Pat\'s pronouns) wasn\'t into it. I want to sleep with you.""\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLittle drunk me was assertive and said , ""I am not interested in that. I\'m only interested in talking.

2019-02-24 21:32:15,aucuxx,1,1,"So... I've been thinking I might be nb. Don't know for sure yet and there's some thoughts that I've been having quite often. I know you can't confirm or deny my gender and it's up to me to figure it out but still, I'm not asking for someone to tell me if i'm ""valid enough"" just tell me if you think my thoughts are something y'all might relate to or not.

I'm a 21 years old amab person but I started considering seriously when I was 20 (isn't that kinda old to notice? I dunno). I guess I never quite fit into the man role, growing up not particularly masculine with both boys and girls as friends and with interests that aren't very gendered and all that stuff, witch I thought I could explain entirely when I discovered I was sexualy attracted to people of all genders (I use the word bisexual to describe me but I guess pansexual would also work). I thought, ""great all this pointlessly gendering of people and other stuff just stuck me as odd because I don't know what its like to only be able to feel attraction to one half of the people"".

Later in life I started following some trans people online (I have never met a trans person irl) and even some nb people. I was aware of the term but now it wasn't just a word, it was actual people and that forced me to ask, if people like me can be whatever gender they want then what makes me be a man? I don't have a good reason, earlier the reason was ""I have a penis"" and after that ""I'm pretty sure im not a woman"" but now there's more options and the lable of non binary doesn't sound like a bad otion at all. I've used ""they"" as a pronoun online but having people who don't know me and who I don't know call me ""they"" doesn't do much. Even before I even considered this I had stated that I ""didn't care about being grammatically correct with gender"" (I'm spanish and in that language you gender pretty much everyhing and sometimes people had mocked me for ""being gay"" or sometimes acknowledged it without mockery by talking about me in femenine, so I would reply with my sentiment that grammatical gender doesn't make much sense)

Here's the thing, I don't have dysphoria. I feel like I could wake up tomorrow with a ""woman's body"" and not care about it, but I don't dislike my body at all. I don't want to medically alter it, not because I wouldn't like the results but because I wouldn't care and it's too much trouble to go through. Honestly not much would change if I finaly knew what word to use to describe me, and because of that I tell myself to not worry so much and just wear the things that I want and continue to use makeup and to look and act how I want (witch I admit I don't always do if there's people watching).

Still I keep coming back to it. Am I a femenine guy or a nb person? How do I know? Is the fact that I keep coming back to it proof? couldn't a cis guy be confused too and thats what I am? Am I too old for this to be true? How would I even begin to explain that to people on top of my sexuality? my parents don't even know I'm bi. Am I looking for a lable to explain a common feeling even among cis people? Am I getting in on a group with an actual valid issue while I acctually don't belong in it? Basicaly, am I non binary?

I know the woke answer tends to be ""you're a valid nb no matter what"" but I also think it's valid to be cis (obviously) so don't tell me I sound nb to you if it's just because it's the correct thing to say. I'm asking for honesty.

2019-02-26 21:49:28,av52aj,7,14,"Hi ! 

I'm a non binary individual, somewhat confused.

I guess it always and still comes down to my need to feel validated, because I feel very ""insecure"" about my non-binary identity.

I'm afab, and my presentation, although I wouldn't call it feminine, includes feminine stuff. I guess I probably look queer, but I can often wear clothes that are typically feminine, and like it. Basically I like some feminine stuff but I don't like that they make me a girl/woman by association. 

I have been on T for 3 months now, and I know that although I do and will like the changes (some of them), it isn't a necessity for me. And I guess I'm on HRT partly because it helps to validate my identity (kinda). Like if my body is masculine or ambiguous, then the importance of the clothes on my body is diluted by half ?

I don't know where I'll get with T, I don't think I want my body to be super masculinized, and T is not likely to get me there before some time.

Right now I like the changes, I like my voice dropping, and I'm curious to see my longer peach fuzz because something else (maybe). 

&amp;#x200B;

But I don't know, maybe I want T, to be able to prove to others and myself that I'm NB ? Is that a bad thing ?

I never considered myself to really have dysphoria. I wouldn't mind some changes in my body, but I also don't mind my body. Social dysphoria maybe, but even that, it's more of being kinda annoyed, not much more than that. So what does that mean ? 

&amp;#x200B;

PS : I'm aware that NB people can be feminine. NB can look any kind of way they want and be valid. But I just don't want to be seen as a woman.

2019-02-27 08:46:39,avbacf,2,2,"18 on I pretty much thought of myself as a female who does not need to conform to traditional gender roles/looks.  That simply by existing, whatever I do, I'm demonstrating 'womanhood'.  It kind of falls into a  feminist 'woman can make whatever the hell choices they please' area. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I've always felt a little disconnected to classical femininity. I remember being confused as to whether or not I was a tomboy in elementary. I think adults would call me one because of my butchy haircut, but I was also a little ballerina and often dressed in pastels and dresses so that term never felt right. 

&amp;#x200B;

The intricacies of girl clothing did come easy to me in middle school. I remember leaving a basketball team tryout before it even started because I walked in wearing our gym uniform shirt and not something more sporty like everyone else.  It was a look of 'ohhh this is after-hours so everyone's chill and I didn't get the memo', coupled with thoughts of 'I'm not good enough at basketball to justify being this uncool.'  Also in middle school I felt this strong pull to be 'one of the guys', but never really acted on it.  This pull often got confused by me with having crushes. Maybe what I was admiring or longing for that I saw in these boys' circles was actually privilege?  My group of girlfriends was often felt demure, polite, and sweet. The boys just seemed more carefree.  

There was also a time here where I cut my hair pixie short and was teased. My mother reminded me that I vowed 'never again' when I, now 24, cut my hair again.

&amp;#x200B;

This haircut I've recently got finally feels 'right' to me.  **I like being able to throw my hair back in a little mini-manbun and not feel like a woman-who-doesn't-try-hard-enough.**  I'm never really sure if that pressure was real or manufactured by me when I was in high school.  Even as a senior, I was certainly the least feminine, least cool/fun girl on the dance team. I had this ideal vision of getting on to the dance team my senior year (I had tried out as a freshmen and not made it) and then promptly cutting off all my hair and dyeing it a pastel purple. Not so much to stand out, but to make a point. There was always a certain 'look' to dance teams, some of it written and some of it unwritten, and I just wanted to point out the ways in which we had the freedom to be different, yet no one ever did.  I ended up not doing it because I was angling for a classical musical role and didn't want to wear a wig.  My theatre dork won out over my secret inner punk.

&amp;#x200B;

So near the end of high school, 'boys' loomed larger in the the collective nerdgirl conscience at my school than they had in previous years. And I coupled up just like everyone else.  First relationships are somehow clumsy, boring, and overly intense all at the same time. Check, check, and check.  The main queer takeaway was that I often felt like I was pretending. Pretending that I was straight? Pretending that I was female? yes and no... More like pretending that I was a girlfriend that felt comfortable in traditionally girlfriend spaces/roles.  And really the bigger issue was that we were both pretending we were 'in a relationship' when in reality we were teens playing at a relationship because we wanted to get laid before college. Took me way too long to realize that btw.

&amp;#x200B;

*""My body tells me noooo-oh. But I won't quit 'cause I want more.""*

 As a 19-year-old female at a normal BMI, I gained 40 lbs in less than 6 months.  Imma be honest here. That takes a concentrated effort.  I has some issues, alrite?  And then genetics and poor self-discipline and some major depression helped spring me to being over 100 pounds overweight just a few years later.  I tend to think this is a unique situation, very different then some freshmen 15 stereotype.  I had an incredibly average female body for 19 years.  Weight, height, build, shoe size, proportion, you name it. And then I straightup ballooned. My mindset was always that I would get back down eventually, and it still is: 45 down, 55 to go.

All of this body setup anyways, is to say that **I do not feel like myself**. I have not felt like myself in different ways for a long time. Sometimes, because of the guy I was dating, sometimes because of the weight gain, sometimes because my gender identity/sexuality feels... questionable, most often because of depression.  At this point, if we're trying to trace back to when I felt normal, we're in high school and I certainly don't want to go back to being that sparkle cloud of naiveté attempting to pass for a person. 

&amp;#x200B;

With the worst of the depression and denial about depression years behind me, and recently more actively working on the weight loss, more space has freed up for this gender/sexuality question,  But a lot of me wants to deny (as I am wont to do) this until after I've lose the rest of the weight.  For myself and others, having accomplished a big forward life move first, makes the concept easier to deal with than if it just seems like another in a long string of fuckups.

&amp;#x200B;

Sexuality wise, Idfk. I haven't been legit interested/attracted to anyone in years. And if anyone's shown any interest in me, my response is, in effect, 'well, you're wrong.' My attitude towards them is typically 'I wouldn't want to belong to any club that would have me as a member.' And this reaction is certainly tied in with the depression and obesity.

Whenever I do feel slight interest/attraction, I'm not confident in it.  With all genders, I find myself questioning if I want to fuck this person or emulate them.  Just apply both pieces of the 'he's the type of guy that men want to be, and women want to be with,' to those you have remotely positive feelings towards and that's where I'm at. I'm constantly like 'Is this admiration or attraction?'  So at this juncture, I have no idea what to look for in a partner, for dating, hookups. Whatever, there's more to unpack there, but I'm digressing and this post is already a ramble and a half.

&amp;#x200B;

I check female on all the forms. I don't think any sort of hormone will ever be for me. But I have a new name picked out. But I don't necessarily feel like I fit under the trans umbrella. But I think I will want some sort of breast reduction/mastectomy/lift once I lose the rest of the weight. I have no idea what coming out looks, sounds or feels like for a nonbinary person. Or if that even applies to me. So yeah, I'm questioning. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**

questioning person looks over past possibly nonbinary life stuff and could use some thoughts/support from those who know what's what.  
Any suggestions (related books, media, etc)? advice?

&amp;#x200B;

so a little backstory, I'm 23 and I've been IDing as nonbinary/genderqueer for multiple years (maybe 6?)

I've had a binder, but I've gained weight so for a couple years couldn't wear it... the other day I found out I could wear it again (barely!) and I was really happy. I've only actually worn it a couple of times mainly because I'm autistic and I had a bit of a time with the seams.

I never thought top surgery would be an option for me (expensive, I have doctor/surgery phobia, various things) so I just never really considered it apart from wishful thinking. BUT now I know it's a possibility! all of the sudden. And I'm not sure if it's some sort of weird genderqueer thing where I really want to transition for a while until i feel more femme again (though I don't so much fluctuate genders or anything, just a sort of ""I'm presenting more masc/femme today"" thing)

&amp;#x200B;

When I was a kid, in 5th grade sex-ed/puberty classes when I found out I would grow a chest I had a really rough time getting to terms with that.

&amp;#x200B;

 I've never really felt connected to my chest (and apparently, I did my measurements with an online calculator and it says I'm about a 42i...) . I feel like it's just a bit of a nusiance, but at the same time mostly I don't think much about it.  


I do really want to have like, that look of wearing a shirt and it's all just flat. I also absolutely hate how I look and feel in the shower and the mirror. But at the same time, I'm really concerned I would miss it if it was gone??  


When I was looking at the surgeon's results (there's a facebook group for him) I saw quite a few people who had double incision without nipple grafts and it's like, I've always hated my nipples and was thinking top surgery with nipples would be weird on me (but thought asking for without would be really weird, until I saw those pictures - I've always kind of wanted a ken-doll appearance, essentially)  


I'm in the middle of a big weight loss thing (I started out as 262 at 5'5""... due to PCOS and uncontrollable weight gain, which I'm now on meds for) so I'm definitely going to wait until I'm smaller before being super serious about getting this, both to help the surgeon get all the fat and put the scars in the right place and so I don't need revision if I lose weight later on.. so I'm not deciding right away but it would be nice to know the general direction I want to go with this (which would probably be 1-3 years before I could do it)

&amp;#x200B;

I have a general history of being obsessed with something until I get it (though never something relating to my body before, but who knows?) and I'm wondering if this is that, where it's a super strong obsession and I eventually cave in and hope i don't regret it (hello $1k drawing tablet!) or if it's something real and I just didn't realize I ever could do it so I just pushed it out of my mind but now that I know it's possible, it's all just happening now?

&amp;#x200B;

IDK, I've had a **really** confusing week going through to maybe I should start low dose/short term T, maybe I should just binary transition, even though I'm nonbinary? myabe I should just forget about this whole thing and live it as I already am?

My wife doesn't take this situation very well and she is scared I may one day decide to transition and she couldn't accept it. I try to reassure her that I don't want to transition I just feel like a man but sometimes i feel more like a woman and I wish I could be more myself with her. I love painting my nails but I'm closeted so I try to do just my toes and only expose it when I'm with her. Baby steps.

In the end it really stresses her out that I am the way I am. 
She recently suggested we get professional help or something that may help her understand and be more comfortable.
I was wondering if anyone here has any websites I can send her to, that may help her understand or learn more about it and be more ok with it. 
Anything she has searched on her own leads to information suggesting Im probably gay and will leave her or transition into a woman and leave her.",NonBinary,Need help finding information,1551422635.0,"{'created_utc': 1551397435, 'id': 'avxs2v', 'num_comments': 5, 'score': 6, 'selftext': ""So Im amab.
